I am glad that there is a convenient way to post pictures in my blog. I have to say that the UI of Hello is rather peculiar and I am not actually sure how I managed to complete my first mission :)   I also have to acknowledge that Blogger's new features to compose posts are really good. WYSIWYG is the thing I wanted. I don't have to deal with HTML any more. I used w.blogger till recently but I had to work with HTML and then had to click Preview, while in Blogger I am actually seeing what I am working on. Feels good that I have to open the HTML window only to do some complicated formatting!  The new shortcuts in Blogger are also useful! I have nearly a desktop program user experience, and now I feel I can do well without w.blogger. It is a neat program but it is far from perfect. Especially its spell checker is terribly dumb, but let's not critisize since it is a free :) The Blogger spell check is also a bit queer. It does not recognize the word "blog" :)
