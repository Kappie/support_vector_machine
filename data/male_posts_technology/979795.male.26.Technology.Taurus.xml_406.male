Articles   -  urlLink Filipino hostage in Iraq appears on TV   -  urlLink Philippines withdraws more troops from Iraq   -  urlLink Philippine south training terrorists    The kidnapped Filipino driver is just human. I'd be scared too if I were in his shoes. But it doesn't change the fact that the message the Phillipines government is sending to dissidents in its own country, the international community, terror networks in the world, political enemies, etc, is that they (Phillipines govt) can be threatened and pressured to do their (eg. terror networks) bidding. The reason for the govt's decision to give in appears more economic than anything else, as a huge no. of it's citizens are working overseas (attracted by higher pay) and a large part of the country's economy and contributions depends heavily on these. But the govt's decision to 'make its people happy' sends out another message. It doesn't have the support or even sufficient control over them. It is little wonder that demonstrations, strikes, protests and riots are frequent over the past few years.    Any government will need to take a hard stance againt hard-lined extremists otherwise there will be no end to terrorists' demands. By giving in once to these demands, there will be a second time, a third, and so on. How long before it's enough? There is a reason asto why the US has adopted a policy of non-negotiation with terrorists, hijackers, etc (although I do believe that some under-the table deal is agreed upon as a resolution to certain or some of these incidents).    Repercussions? This latest fiasco won't be Phillipine's last. There will be future incidents similar to this. International aid from countries to help out in rebuilding Iraq will falter and we may see more countries pulling out soon or refusing toassist (eg. Thailand). Political and religious radicals will view Phillipines as a promising base of operations and hotspotwhere they can recruit and carry out some of their terror activities.         Chinese Govt making a big 'Hoo-Hah' over DPM Lee's visit to Taiwan     Articles  -  urlLink DPM Lee responds to China's protests   -  urlLink Taiwan trip 'doesn't change or contradict 'one China' policy'   -  urlLink Beijing noises a test for DPM and S'pore    I don't really have a problem with Chinese people (sure sure, they appear chatty sometimes in public but let's face it, it's the same for Singaporeans - regardless of race, language or religion).   Whether DPM Lee's visit to China is right or wrong is something I can't comment on as I don't know enough. But as the PM-to-be, he has taken all the necessary steps such as informing China about the visit to Taiwan out of courtesy.Despite China's request that the trip be called off, he noted the request but made made a reply that it was not possible.     "... to call off the trip at China's request would have undermined our right to make independent decisions, and damaged our international standing. As a small country, this is a vital consideration in our dealings with all countries. ..."     The ChineseGovt should bear in mind that they made a request, not a threat. If they intend to 'bully' other countries into submission, I don't see them being any different from the terrorists who are holding the Phillipines govt by that invisible 'leash'.    urlLink  Shanghai scraps fair organised by Singapore firm      An article by Professor Qiao Xinsheng at the Zhongnan University of Economics and Law was headlined 'What's Up With Singapore?'    "... China has said that 'the Taiwan question is the Chinese people's own matter, so foreigners should not interfere', he wrote. 'But this trip to Taiwan by Lee Hsien Loong once again shows us that Singapore does not quite think of itself as foreign to this matter.' ..."    Oh please! Mr Prof, get your facts right before you go firing up the wrong ass. Did he really think that DPM Lee was there for talks on how Taiwan can gain its independence?. I even saw an article in Streats yesterday saying that Singapore view ourselves as untouchable (in a sort of way), that's why we didn't actually consider China's 'feelings' (duh?).The only way that is possibleis if you dominated the world and every country. 'Untouchable' indeed...     urlLink  Be careful with Taipei, KL told       "... Speaking at a dinner on Wednesday, (Chinese Ambassador to Malaysia) said Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's visit to Taiwan had greatly irked China, and advised Malaysia to heed the lesson. 'We will not ask Malaysia to halt unofficial activities and interactions with Taiwan, but we will object directly to any official and formal ones,' he said. ..."    Isn't that a contradiction? DPM Lee had already informed China prior to his visit that it was a pte and unofficial trip. Look at how the Chinese Govt took it? Duuuh...     "... 'Our relations with China are deep and broad. The principle is mutual interest and mutual benefit, and not concessions accorded by one side to the other. As we said in our earlier statement, it would be regrettable if relations are affected, because both sides will stand to lose. If our relations cannot survive this episode, then they must be shallow and brittle.' ..."    I agree that the Chinese Govt is just testing what are the buttons they can push and how much pressure they can apply on the Singapore Govt. Such petty responses, but for what reason? Probably economic and political. We all know how to handle such bullies...    What I like about DPM Lee's visit to Taiwan is that, unlike the Chinese Govt, we do not get trapped over bickering of words, issue of 'face' (mian4 zi3), but instead concentrate on the bigger picture and what we can learn.    DPM Lee's impressions of Taiwan after the visit:     "The Green side is focused on the upcoming Legislative Yuan election. They feel that a stronger Taiwanese identity is emerging, and that more Taiwanese now support independence.    The Blue side is preoccupied with the validity of the presidential election, the court proceedings and the investigation of the March 19 shooting incident.    It may be some time before both Green and Blue leaders and their supporters focus their thinking on the longer-term position of Taiwan and work out their respective strategies for the way ahead.    None of the friends I met gave me the impression that the Taiwanese leaders were eager for a confrontation across the strait.    Several told me that the leaders will not push for independence. They also recognised that what matters is not what the leaders say, but what they do.    I did notice the stronger Taiwanese identity among the population. I also learnt that most Taiwanese believe that China will not attack them. It seems that most also believe that the US will come to Taiwan's rescue if China does attack. I was troubled by this.    The Taiwanese media are focused almost exclusively on domestic issues, with very little reporting of what is happening in the world outside, like North Korea or Iraq.    The Taiwanese have not fully come to terms with how rapidly China is transforming itself, and consequently, how interdependent the US and China are becoming.    This is especially so with Taiwanese political leaders and officials who are not allowed to visit China.    For the same reason, the Taiwanese public do not know how other major powers like Germany, France, Italy and Russia and India are repositioning themselves and adjusting their policies to this different China that is emerging.    Because of their preoccupation with domestic politics and winning votes, they have not adequately factored in the vast changes in the international situation. So we cannot rule out a miscalculation or mishap that would have serious repercussions on Singapore and the region.    We must watch the situation carefully."     Some responses to the whole incident:   urlLink  No way to treat an old friend like Singapore    I especially like the term 'kow-tow politics' used as it clearly depicts the current expectations China has on Singapore.     "... I remember well when Indonesia kicked up a real big fuss over the fate of a few of its commandos, who had been caught after bombing MacDonald House in the 1960s, even though Jakarta didn't have a legal leg to stand on. That was when Singapore was newly independent and, being a small country with no hinterland, had seemed fair game for big countries to try and dictate its policies. Some things never change."    "... Once Singapore becomes accommodating to one big power, it may demand more, with others joining in. Then we would end up dancing to everyone else's tune but our own."    "... China's action clearly shows that we, a small nation, must continue to help ourselves and be united, otherwise we will be bullied into accepting 'kow tow' politics."     urlLink  What could have provoked China's stern rebuke     "... The Singapore Government will do what it can to repair any damage. If it was a diplomatic faux pas, it should express its regrets to China. But there's no need for Singapore to prostrate itself before China or anybody."
