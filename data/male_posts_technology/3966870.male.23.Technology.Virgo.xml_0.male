But I have removed the TV cam for now and I have added a WebCam! Now you can take a little more depth look into myworld..Which is most cases isn't much LOL I am still adding some features to the blog. I have some more links to put up and some of my favorite sites I visit as well.  I will be also be putting together a Linux help section for tips and tricks for n00bies and some server stuff too. I will also be adding some Modeling graphics sometime in the future as I get more into that. I will also be posting all of the great art work I make I will be getting a deviantart account so I can put everything in one place.   I guess that's it for now! I am sure I will be adding tons of content to the site once I remember what it is ;)
