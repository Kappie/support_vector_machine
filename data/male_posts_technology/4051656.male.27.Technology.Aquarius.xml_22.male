The part that is news is the actual process. Cannabinoids had previously been shown to inhibit the growth of blood vessels in mice. But the mechanism involved remained a mystery and it was not known if the same effect occurred in humans.  In the new Spanish-led study, cannabinoids were injected into mice with gliomas. DNA analysis was then carried out on 267 genes associated with the growth of tumour blood vessels. It showed that the cannabis compounds reduced the activity of several genes involved in VEGF production.  Professor Manuel Guzman, from Complutense University in Madrid, said: “In both patients, VEGF levels in tumour extracts were lower after cannabinoid inoculation.”  So, maybe now instead of surgery followed by chemotherepy that may or may not kill the tumor, we can prescribe a treatment that actually works and is enjoyable to administer. Why is this drug still illegal again?
