Worked until one, when I told Mark that the PC was fucked beyond repair, and unless he had a backup (fat fucking chance) then the thing is going to shit.  "Oh, don't worry about it. I'm replacing it with a different PC I found up here!"  Great idea. Now, who's the A+ here?  Fag.  I hope the dick gets fired.
