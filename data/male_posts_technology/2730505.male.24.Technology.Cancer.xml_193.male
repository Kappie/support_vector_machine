I fucking hate it.  Is there a law out there that states a mandatory time spent with the child's father?  I don't like being limited on not being able to see my own blood because of some stupid reasons (ie. the latest one being she had a birthday party to go to so she can't make it out to chicago {they live in Iowa}. that means that I can't take my son by myself). What the fuck do I do? Are there Federal Laws stating that I should have mandatory time with him?  Any ideas?  I really don't know if this is the proper channel for this sort of stuff but I won't know till I ask right?
