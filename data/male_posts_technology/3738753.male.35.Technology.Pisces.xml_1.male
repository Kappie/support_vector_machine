But then I would be tempted to take it one step further and start on the first month of the year as well.  I can't wait that long to start a fuckin' blog.  Plus, who wants to be that "anal."    Today I feel melancholy.  I am in the middle of a divorce.  How good can one possibly feel about that?  It's not something very eventful like a fuckin' birthday or Christmas.  Some will argue that this is a GOOD thing.  My marriage has been in a shithole for some time and this will somehow release me from the shackles of torture.  It's hard loving someone and knowing that letting them go is the best thing for you.  Isn't that irony at its fuckin' best?  Why am I "blogging?"  I read about some slutty government chick who put all her exploits on the web and got fired from her job.  Not that anyone will ever get to read about my "exploits."  Yeah, like I fuckin' have any.  If I couldn't even keep a sexual relationship going in a marriage, how the hell could I do it outside of it?  Although some will contest that marriage kills the sex life, at least there are 2 participants.  It's a lot harder flying solo.  At least in marriage there will always be 1 pilot.  Our plane crashed and burned.  She fell asleep at the wheel.  Am I that fuckin' boring?  I hope not.  Let's just say she was "frigid" and leave it at that.  End of discussion.  Why is my blog entitled "I know what's good for you?"  Simply because I have made more mistakes than I can count on my feet and hands and because you "Learn from your mistakes" that makes me more knowledgable than most.  Learn from my life so you don't end up fucked up like I am.  In addition, I have a slightly higher IQ than the average person in this country.  This makes me slightly more intelligent than a chimpanzee and extrememly more intelligent than the President.  Listen my friend and listen well, the whispers of wisdom will fill you with knowledge.  Knowledge is power...
