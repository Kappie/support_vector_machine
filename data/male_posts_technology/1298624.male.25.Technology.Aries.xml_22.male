God help me. We are gonna go for brunch, lunch... whichever. Then she will help me buy some capris. Maybe get our nails done. Do some planting later when mom gets home.  Oh speaking of planting, the back yard is looking great! Dad bought grass...like 5 pieces. He wanted to try it out first. He will go back tomorrow to buy more. It's really nice, Edgar!! I can't wait til we have our first BBQ in the new perty backyard! :)
