Ram, mariyaadhaya, Infy experience pathi seekarama blog pannu.......Do you guys meet each other?...You  Kicha?.....Guess, You should be under training now.......  Sriprasath, I don't know if that    It news   is your own research on different issues or just a replica from a magazine. But I can say you, that AOL is worth for its $23.95, when compared to wal-mart's dial-up service. I've had both the providers, in the past (Wal mart's was just for a week, I was really frustrated)....There is a BIG difference in quality, i would say......BTW, Why have you given the same news twice?....If you've missed something, you have the edit option, to add it on, to your previous blog itself......  I was a bit busy with my final exams  the 11th hr assignment submissions.....Yet to be relieved....My exams are over next week...I thought I would'nt be able to blog till then.....  But when I read Xavier's  "Ranting" , could'nt resist blogging......Who's the gal man?.......I could infer one thing... Of all those, who've read Xavier's other blog, Ram seems to be the one, who's most affected.....Whoz your gal Ram???? Others who have'nt noted this, I would recommend to back to Ram's last blog.....  will post my views on  "She hated losing. That was the last time I played chess."  , in my next blog
