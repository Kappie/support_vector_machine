"fly away on my Zephyr I feel it more then ever and in this perfect weather We'll find a place together fly on my wing"    just a quick recall of what happend few weeks back:  the seminar me and teejz conducted turned out fine. next couple of weeks and it'll be keech and psyg's turn. i had a three nights straight drinking session that week. the 6 of us was there at the meet. peter, zero, psyg, teejz, keech and me. we're planning to make profit into the drugs business.. umm.. downers to be exact. we're quite serious about it. and it'll be legal of course.    "riddlin on liberator find a way to be a skater rev it up to levitator super mainly aviator take a look its on display - for you coming down no not today    we have a new tambayan. "make love not war" near common ground. umm.. the ambiance is quite good and the acoustic music is relaxing. keech just stopped blogging. well i know that would be for now pero he'll gonna come back soon. he should.    "fly away on my Zephyr I feel it more then ever and in this perfect weather we'll find a place together in the water where the scent of my emotion all the world will pass me by fly away on my Zephyr we'll find a place together"
