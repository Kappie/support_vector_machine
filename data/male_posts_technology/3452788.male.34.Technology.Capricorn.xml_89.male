I touch your skin as you lay beside me I want to feel something wonderful there Love, support, understanding, empathy  Instead I feel anger, sadness, guilt, resentment, fear flowing from your skin to my fingers like acid numbing my nerves, my arms, my soul  your pain goes straight for my heart like tiny daggers, each little stab  adding to the hurt and shame I already feel  how can I make things better for you, for us when you won’t talk to me?  All you give me  is love, mixed with tears and anguish and silence  do you have your own demons too,  or are mine reaching out to pull you in? the experts tell me that’s how it works  we are in deep trouble, I’m afraid you can’t heal, because I can’t feel anything but falling, drowning, dying     welcome to my darkness.
