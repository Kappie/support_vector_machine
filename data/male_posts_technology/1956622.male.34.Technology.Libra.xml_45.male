She said she was driving and wanted to go so again I let her give me hugs and kisses and go do whatever it was she was doing.    SFW   and I talked today.  I went to court appointed parenting class and while sitting there I realized that I had better consider mediating with   SFW   otherwise I may be caught with my pants down losing the contempt case and then owing a bunch of money while I go through mediation.    For the first time   SFW   said "I am sorry about all of this" and it actually sounded like it had some meaning in it.  Of course in almost the same breath she said you know I keep coming back to the contempt thing are you still going to go through with it?  I answered her question with another question "if I was not paying child support to you would you do whatever you could to make sure I paid it?"  Her silence was golden!  I said, "I will take your silence as a yes and since it is a yes here is why I am doing this.  You seem to think that you can go ahead and break the law and do these things to the kids because up until now no one has opposed you.  So I am going to go through with this because I have a point to make and that is simply I will not be bullied by you and more importantly I will not allow you to disrespect me and get away with it."    Her reply was simply "well I think you have made your point!"  To which I responded with "I do not think I have you say that now because you do not want to have to deal with it but I want you to stand in that court room and understand that what you have done is wrong and NOT in the best interest of your children."  Of course she said "I did what I had to do and I will explain that to the judge since you are going to go through with this."  Of course   FS's   parents showed up and they were headed to a BBQ so she had to go.   If we were arguing over dishes or something I would have no problem giving in but we are not I am fighting for my little girl.  I am fighting for the right to see her, be with her, hug her and ultimately to be her daddy.  Right now I am just a voice on the phone and that is hard to deal with.
