Unhappy activity Happens in the limelight, center of attention  Mark 2:1-12 The paralytic Most embarrassing moment With jesus Right after the healing of the leper Everyone knows jesus Curious people Religious leaders – out to get him  Friends open a 4x8 opening in the roof Mud thatch roof, lots of dust and stuff Roof was repaired probably once a year Friend lying on a 3x6 pallet  Teachable moment – the whole crowd just watches this pallet come down What was it like for the paralytic Can you imagine what he was looking at as he was lowered?  v.5 – whose faith? ‘Son’ a term of endearment for a total stranger, a person Jesus has never met before  The friends want him healed – they don’t care about him being forgiven, necessarily. The religious leaders are upset.  This doesn’t fit their model of forgiveness, because if Jesus can forgive sins, then He really is God. When Jesus encounters people, He always talks about something they are thinking but don't want to say.  Immediately Jesus  v. 9 which is easier to say? To be forgiven or to be healed To be forgiven is easier because there is no sure fire way to prove it really happened.  ** From Christ’s point of view, as an all powerful God, the easier thing to say was ‘to be healed.’  For to say ‘you are forgiven’ would require a perfect person to pay the ultimate price in order for one to be totally and truly forgiven.
