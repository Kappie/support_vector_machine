Basically a sister unit was unable to provide the usual guard duty personnel for certain days due to a sequence of outfield exercise they were involved in. Naturally, our unit had to be pulled in to replace the guard duty personnel. In the process of all the reshuffling, some people had to cover by taking up extra days of duty.  1 particular person went to get MC in order to escape from a duty day allocated to him. In the process, other people had to be arrowed to take up his duty. He is so childish and irresponsible. Instead of reflecting on his actions, he feels that it was my RSM's fault that other people got the duty. This mentality is dominant in several people, they do not see the fact that these extra duties HAVE to be fulfilled, and that my RSM actually had no choice but to allocate them to the men. It wasn't some random punishment meted out to the men for nothing. It was just something that HAD to be done. Such childish and selfish thoughts and behaviour are what I have to put up with most often in the office. Looking at this particular person, I feel seriously disappointed with people as a whole. I feel sorry for my 2 friends who have been seriously affected by his inconsiderate actions.  I have a final full day guard detail tomorrow on Sat. So looking forward to it because that's the last duty of the month for me. I really have to GAMBATTE!
