Is it lying when you totally believe what you're saying?    http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ideas_opinions/story/204959p-176936c.html      There was a man who went to see a psychiatrist. First, the shrink showed him a picture of crossed sticks and then one of hundreds of little dots. "What's that?" the shrink asked. The man said snakes and ants having sex. The shrink told the man he was obsessed with sex. "What do you expect," the patient replied, "when you keep showing me dirty pictures?"
