Wherein, despire thwartings from all sides, and betwixt the middle bit, one manages to find a ray of sunshine, or.. moonshine, to afix thine hopes to. And despite these adversities (not to be confuzzled with universities) one continufies the smileage, because .. ahh and this is the key.. BECAUSE they haft inspiration with meer mmmmm. Like mercona for life, yeah baby. yeah. I'm launch0ring into a line from 'dancing in the moonlight' now, in my mind, theres an odd rastarustyfoofarfeefifarian in there, saying 'yeh mon' after every line the lil 'thinks hes gangstah' south auckland boy says, about having no money and wanting to spraypaint his name on the wall. It's all a quiescent cacaphony of illustrious rapture, inspired by.. the moonlight. Why dancing in the moonlight? because dancing in the sunlight, would be, well, washing up liquid, and that aint no fun, son. A'aight? There's a deeper reasoning a meaning, some symbolism behind the moon, and my recent admiration henceforth of this worldly glowing orb.. and probably a kazillion layers of hidden meaning about reflecting ones happiness back to thine self, and so on and so forth.. but we wont get into that. INstead focus on the nubility. It is the moon. She's my moon, and while all is inspired by her, all seems accomplishable, and therefore, a muse, motivation, and purpose.. not really sure, being the moon, that she understands that. She should tho. She glows. it makes me glow, back and forth, like a double mirror.. not one of those bendy ones what makes you look fat or skinny or like a muppet. I'm Idaho. But she's the moon.
