Ok, I had one of those today.  No one likes taking a crap at work.  I don't know what it is - the fact that other people have placed their bare ass on the same spot where you now have to, or the feeling of unfaithfulness to your home commode.  Whatever the reason, theres only one thing thats worse - having no choice but to take a stall next someone else.  I don't know about women's washrooms, but men's usually only have two stalls (or at least they do here at work). I also don't know if this is universal across both sexes, but guy's like that "buffer zone".  No one wants to take the stall next to someone else who's already in there doing their business.  That's where my day comes in. I had to go so bad I'm sure I was walking funny all the way to the can. Anyways, I get in there thanking god that I made it and someone is already in one of the stalls!  I didn't know what to do - do I leave and try to fend of this monster turd until the guy is done or do I just get in the damn stall and suck it up?  Well, I decided to suck it up...partially.  I went in and sat down, and tried to judge how long the other guy had been there. I wasn't hearing anything so I figured he'd been there a while so I tried to pinch it off and wait. Problem?  I think he was doing the same thing!  I think a minute went by in complete silence and the pressure was building up to the point where I could barely hold it any longer, and then just at the last second, I hear him going for some toilet paper.  Ahhh..safe now right? NO! He must've used like 4 pounds of toilet paper!  Pull, pull, pull, rip...pause...pull, pull, pull, rip...pause...  over and over again like 10 times!  I felt like screaming out "what the hell did you do? shit all over yourself?!!"  I swear it took this guy 2 minutes just to wipe his ass!  I figured I'd be safe with the noise he was making and besides, I couldn't wait any longer, so I just let go. But guess what? The increased pressure caused a loud splash. Everything goes silent. Did I get away with it? The guy leaves his stall and washes his hands.  I started to relax thinking now I could just do this in peace. But as he's walking out he stops just outside my stall and I swear to god, the guy says "Take it easy in there, you'll hurt yourself!" and leaves.  Comedians everywhere..
