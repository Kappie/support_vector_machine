So you might think he'd be thrilled that someone in the White House used one of his research papers to draft a speech for President Bush last week. But he's not. In a hotel conference room in Tampa, Fla., on Friday, Bush told law enforcement officials that Fidel Castro was brazenly promoting sex tourism to Cuba. "The dictator welcomes sex tourism. Here's how he bragged about the industry," Bush said. "This is his quote: 'Cuba has the cleanest and most educated prostitutes in the world.' " Asked about the source for the quote, White House officials provided a link to a 2001 paper, written by Trumbull, on the website of the Association for the Study of the Cuban Economy. At the time he wrote the paper, Trumbull was a Dartmouth College undergraduate, and the paper won a prize from the association as the best student paper of the year.  The Charlie Trumbull referred to in  urlLink this article  is the same Charlie Trumbull that was was in  urlLink my fraternity  at  urlLink Dartmouth .
