As usual talking about the Honda Cibic, what mod this and that....while a bunch of skylines and Silvias drove pass. Evos and Rexes are common but it was like suppose to be and it is Majority of Honda car. Went two round with Jayden and Eric. Testing the car's coilover and mods. Handling is superb and the tyres is gripping well. But the damn rear suspension seems to have a problem with me. One side seems to sink lower when weight is loaded. Next week I got to send in for realignment. Cam pulley also changing. And some other minor minor mods here and there or maybe September! I overspent this month :( I want bucket seats ...want SAFC2....tuning....Initially tot of body kit but no no I got a problem with the damn hump already...new blow job for...i mean paint job for my bumper....I feel like spraying the entire car to Yellow! and become dirty fellow! What else I need? I gonna get my digital cam mid august ....and what else? let me think.............Ah I want camber kit front and rear both together!....ok that's all......it's like gonna set me back a few ks.....:((((((( God...can you be kind enough to drop a bag of gunny sack stacked with SGD notes? No SAMPLES allow!  After sending Adrian and Jen home, and after pharking I mean parking my car....I still seeing the patch of blood stain left over and remind me of the the dead kitten....for due respect I did not walk over it......Awww....bad feeling.....and when I stepped out of the lift...I hear Dog whining coming from the opposite construction site for Edewissle...very terrible whining...as in being killed by the Bagalas or being bitten by some ruthless animal......  Hey I need Sleep now for tomorrow food eating session! YUM YUM!!!!
