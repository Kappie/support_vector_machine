I do not look terribly over weight, but I carry my weight everywhere and I am heavier than I look.  I need to loose a good 50 pounds.  6'7" and 250lbs is a weight I can work with or at least move around with and not hurt my ankles just walking :-).    'bout got the back room in order and have a little den area established.  Quite happy with it actually.  My wife even likes it.  Her desk gets "re-arranged" next :-).    Beautiful day here in Portland.  81 degrees and blue sky.  Downtown was just beautiful to walk around in today.  To bad I needed to take it easy on my Achilles Tendon and could not walk as much as I usually do.    That's all folks.
