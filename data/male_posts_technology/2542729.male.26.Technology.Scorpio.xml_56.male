With a spiritual mind that seeks fulfillment and a heavenly presence that provides patience, such that experience writes ryhmes with reason for being...and not because I can. Within this frame work of a previously tattered mind I find a consolance. Where men fail with lack of depth  disbelief, my mind transcends in stages and before long, the book of my life is filled with content. I've spent all my time on reason without examining divine will. But as the Lord himself says...   "It is finished," spoke the Lord Jesus Christ some 2000+ years ago, after which he bowed his head and gave up His spirit. (Plz reference John 19:30)  There was war between the goodness of Jesus and the evil one, But Jesus endured all things for us; It is finished; It is done, He fasted forty days and nights, Satan tempting Him with things, But Jesus said do not tempt the Lord God, lest evil it brings.  He is the Son of God, He was here for our souls to save, But Satan was fighting to the end, ‘til all were in their grave, I’m so glad I had Jesus on my side, truth and goodness won, It is finished; We shall go now to the Father, through the Son.  All who believe in His Holy Name and accept with the mouth and heart, This Son of the Father will never from your side part, He said it was finished as He gave up the ghost on that old hill, Just as it will be finished for us, if we go to the Father, through the Son, His will.  He was on the old cross upon a hill that day, praying, possibly again, I do so thank Him, as He said it is finished, He paid for my sin, I can now safely go through life knowing I am hid in He, Who said it is finished, when on that old Cross, He died for me.  While He was in the world, all the Father gave Him, He did keep, None lost but Satan, Jesus was safely keeping His sheep, He was the Blessed Shepherd, going against the mighty foe, Even to the bottomless pit, for it to be finished, our Lord did go.  --William Hallmark  reconnected::
