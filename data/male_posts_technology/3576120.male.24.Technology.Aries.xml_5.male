Sweet Tea is back in the hiznizzle…… So I realize that it has been like a million years since my last post, but I have been busy stressing over my last two college classes… it is only now that I have had a chance to breath…  Okay, so let's recap the last few weeks….  I saw three movies over this time… the bourne supremacy, I robot, the village…  The Bourne Supremacy, was an absolute disappointment…. As a fellow poster posted in his blog, the movie failed to capture my attention and I gained no emotional damage towards the lost of a major plot character.  The movie was also overdriven with complicated spy and espionage stuff.  I think sometimes they try to do this to make the movie look smarter than it really is in real life, but all they achieved was to make a confusing movie that never seemed to go anywhere important.   Why should I car that Jason Bourne can't remember everything he has done.  Also, I think the filmmakers forgot that the first movie was predominately an action movie the first time around.  There were lots of fights and a reasonable plot that you could keep up with.  This movie had some fighting, but it also had more of a clunky story that seemed like it should have been over half way through the movie.  I,Robot, despite my initial concern about this picture, this one actually ended up okay.  After all, it is what it is a CGI action movie designed to pander to a younger generation….  This would in many was be a good date movie… it's got the jumps and the bumps that will at least make you happy for a few minutes.  Next the Village, this was not a bad movie at all.  It was slow, but that's all right.  Most people probably hated it for being slow, and I could honestly say that when I saw it opening night, that the majority of the audience was disappointed with it afterwards.  I think they were thinking it was going to be a hip cool slasher like pick.  And the truth is, it probably would have been all right like that as well.  However, slasher flick, is not M Night's specialty.  I also think a lot of people living angry because they are tricked through the movie to believe one thing and then at the end it is different.  This type of film also set up the audience for a let down.  Oh well, I think M Night did a good job, but I don't think he is the next steven spielberg.  Now the only major complaint that I had through out the village was the audience.  I just don't understand why people have to be such dicks with the habits.  For instance, there was this young lady who came into the movie with here family and here one-year-old child.  Now first off, this is a rated R movie, next the child will never remember this movie either.  But of course they brought the child and you know what it did?  It cried the entire fucking movie.  Not just a little, but a lot.  And did the mother ever consider leaving the theater with the child.  Nope, absolutely fucking not.  I swear, that this is were lake city can become extremely annoying, because no one and I mean no one had the balls to complain.  I will say that I should have complained, but I never had the guts, plus I was in the middle of an aisle.  Sometimes I wish I had grenades to through at these people and their stupidity, but life can't be that fun.  The was also this little incident with a lady and her cell phone.  I wish these would just die.  I wish that the movie theater had a button in the back of the room attached all the sets.  And when some gets out of line… sap… barbecued chicken anyone.  Oh well!  I also don't understand how stupid people are… for instance… I had a group of younger kids sit behind me at first when we got there… well I am a tall person.. and I was in my set first, but they still decided to sit behind me.. and all I could here was how this one kid was unhappy about sitting behind me.  You know, I all I wanted to do was turn around a shove my wang chung into his face and say suck it… just to shut him up.. anyway.. not that I have managed to make this blog yet dirty again… I will leave you with that.. Bye for now.
