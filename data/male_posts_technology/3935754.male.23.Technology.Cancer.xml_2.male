For the last two weeks, I have ventured away from Fort Collins over to the East Coast - Poughkeepsie, New York to be exact. I am out here with my mom, two of my three sisters and my uncle visiting my aunt and the rest of their family. We left on Tuesday July 6th and as we're approaching our 13th day on the road I am just anxious to be back in my town, sleeping and my bed and being back with my friends.   What's funny about it though is that it doesn't even feel like two weeks have even gone by. When I booked my plane tickets a few weeks ago I thought to myself "how the hell am I going to be out here for two weeks?", but what's funny is that it's really flown by really fast and hasn't felt like two weeks at all. I think part of it is my working half-days while I'm out there. I think the other part is that we've been so busy too. Between going to New York City, the Yankees game, going to Boston and then going up to Lake Champlain for five days, we really haven't had that much time to be home.  I think the other part of it is the fact that I've been in such close touch witha lot of people from home. The resignation of Pegge, my campus minister and who I've considered my mentor, has really had a significant impact on this trip. Part of me really wishes I was back at home, able to talk to Emily and the other Spirit Fire people. There's another part of me that's thankful for me being away, as I've really had time to process things and being away from the situation. I'm really strugging with how things are going to look when I keep back. I'm really afraid about keeping my boundries, and if I really will be able to keep my distance when I know full well the campus ministry program that I've put so much work into may very well fall apart. You'll find that I'll write more on this later, as this has really become a source of turmoil for me. I don't have time to give the whole History Channel special, but that will come soon enough.  -Late
