There are supposedly three different techniques with varying success rates and the price that corresponds with each.  Ultimately the "best" technique has a 97% effective and costs in the neighborhood of $15,000-$20,000.  This sounds all nice a gravy for that family on the other side of the street that has had five boys when all they wanted was 2 boys and a girl but they kept trying and trying.  It's also bad because in places like India since they would much rather have a boy.  The expectant mothers would actually go to get an ultrasound as early as possible to find out if their child will have the "preferred" gender, if not, they would go abort the baby.  Now I have a pro-choice stance with the abortion topic but if you're going to choose to kill a child because they aren't males then that's some bullshit.  I can understand if there is a child conceived under severe circumstances (i.e. incest, rape, or you find out that the baby will grow up with a severe disorder etc.) abortion seems like an option.  But if you're just going to kill the baby because of preference, then that is some bull shit right there.  If everyone had a preference of males in their future children, their whole country would be pretty fucked up with just all males.  They would have to import in women to reproduce right (scary thought)?  Another issue with this is as with any new technology, it always starts out expensive.  Right now there are no regulations or a regulatory body to prevent the "abuse" because a majority of the population cannot afford it so there is no need to keep a watchful eye over it.  As costs continue to drop and success rate is getting closer to 100%, what regulations can be put in place to preserve nature's balance?  I do realize that there are different factors that affect the gender of a child and couples can try to influence that but ultimately shouldn't we leave this to nature?  I think this is something that should be left alone.  You have to deal with what you get and roll with the punches (pretty much take what life gives you, shit happens deal with it type thing).  What do you think?
