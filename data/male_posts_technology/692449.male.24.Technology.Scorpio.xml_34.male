What to do then? How can I take everything in at once? Or maybe it is all a dream. I would like to get a good look at the universe for perspective, but then again it would be through my perspective. If I could only be someone else just for a minute I think that would help me get away from my biases and from my ego. Maybe we as humanity should change into a hivemind structure that would get us away for this self-focus that plagues our society. I hate it when I see people who think about no one else. I constently wonder what people are thinking, going, feeling, or seeing. What are the storys that people have? Who are those people on the freeway? Ahh questions which may never be anwsered.
