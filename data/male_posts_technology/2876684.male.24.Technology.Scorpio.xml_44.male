Anyways, after calling them back and sorting it out we all have different booking codes now. So that means I can change my own flight without affecting the others, but I have to pay  $200  to re-book my flight plus any extra difference in fare since it was one of them "Red-E Deal" ones. Maybe I should just no-show like I said in my last post. *sigh*  Oh well I did buy my ticket to see  urlLink Steve Vai  at Enmore Theatre on 27th July. Woo hoo! It's been 10 years since he's been to Oz so it should be a hell of a show. :)
