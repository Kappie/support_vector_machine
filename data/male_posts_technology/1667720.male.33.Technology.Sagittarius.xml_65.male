The weather was ass but the roads were smooth with no traffic; much better than the roads I've been training on.  Mavrick is doing a brick today (4 hr bike, and 30 min run) but I'm ready for that maddness just yet. If I recover from today's ride quickly and without insident, I'll do the brick with him next week. Sure is nice to know someone that's done this stuff before.  Oh, to be honest, the ride was really more like 48 miles and some change.
