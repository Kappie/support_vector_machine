Samavesh means "encompassing"..  true to its name, participants from all the development centers had come here... it was one of the best events I've ever witnessed... it had virtually everything u could hope for... the span of events were spread across sports (volleyball, throwball, football, TT etc) to the usual stuff of Antakshari, Dumb C, JAM, Ad Mad etc...   Friday evening show was the dance. It was unbelievable to see a bunch of software engineers dance like true professionals.. it was not just a shake of hips... every team had chose a theme for the dance... and presented them very meticulously... Saturday, there was even more in store.. the antakshari made everyone remain on their toes... How in the world do they remember so much songs..!! The quiz was both informative and interesting... there were lots of animated moments that only a "live" audience could ever enjoy...  We (people like me) did our part too.. even though we were not taking part in any event, we were the ones who added color to the show with our "cheering-up"... shouting at the top of our voices.. The team from Chennai had brought in drums and a huge flag... it was more like sitting among a crowd watching cricket match...  Nandan was in the middle for sometime during quiz... as he kept his first step on the stage.. the drums began to roll... and we were not far behind... we got empty Kinley bottles and started banging on the tables and chairs... and of course, our voices were at their largest decibels... Nandan was quick to remark with a smile "I never got such a 'lively' welcome in my life...!!" He sure was spot on...!!  Saturday evening, as prizes were distributed there was a crackers display.. The sky was lit with color... the darkness could be realised only if someone reminded that it was late evening... night seems to have meekly handed over the baton to the day... it was so colourful that the gifted eyes which were fortunate to witness it were saturated with delight... it was around 9.30PM when everything got over... as the people from other DCs slowly and tiredly walked to their respective buses.   They were truely, days to cherish...
