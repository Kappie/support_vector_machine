Yes, the chicken geeking, feats of strength and other such dark corners of the human experience will once again unfold mere meters from the sanctity of my own home.  I will try to get pictures when I ride into work tommorow.  In the meantime I suggest that everyone  urlLink pick up  a copy of Katherine Dunn's wonderful book  Geek Love  in order to get some idea of what to expect.
