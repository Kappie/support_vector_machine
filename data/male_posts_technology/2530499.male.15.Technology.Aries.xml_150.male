We only got to play one game until: -Bugs got annoying! -Ben's Super 9 bolt was phucked up! -Rain rained!  But, now I'm talking to Jacque and all is well once more. By the way, you all need to rent Hitman: Contracts for PS2 (Or box...I guess...but the Emotion graphics for 'S2 are soooo much better than the box.) because Hitman is a most-kickass game. Second-best FPS I've played next to CS for PC. Woot! Anyways, fixed my S9 tonight and I smell like DEET (Repel Sportsman...40% DEET!! Deep Woods OFF! the pussy brand, has only 28.3% DEET.) and it's not cool. Shit happens. I use 'anyways' a lot. Anyways, I'm going. Bye.  [Music:] AT Jingle!
