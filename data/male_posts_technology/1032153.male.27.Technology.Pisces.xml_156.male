Ok let me see now....some pens (including a nice red one with a rubber grip), a clock, a plastic model of a moa, a sofa for my cell, an inhaler, a watch, a  urlLink mandarin , a floppy disk, a shop bell, some matches, a pottery church, a bible, a diary (which is a nice orange/mandarin colour), a newspaper clipping, an ASB brochure about home loans, a little wooden japanese doll type thing, a computer and lots of paper things in a paper thing stacker. Hmmm. I still fell uninspired, except for perhaps one item.....   Mandarins What do they inject mandarins with to make them last so long?
