Aidan was so cute the way he cried and screamed whenever a little bit of slimy seaweed brushed past his foot.  He was paralyzed and wouldn't take any step towards any seaweed.  In the mean time, Ivy was having a blast, laying down in the sand, in the shallow waves, just running around having a good time.  I setup a large towel as our home base.  We ate snacks and drank juice, watching as the tide came in.  I tried digging holes, but the sand was too riddled with broken seashells.  The kids didn't put up too much of a fight when it was time to go.  We went home and I made them some lunch, then put them down for a nap.  That afternoon, after their nap, I took them outside to play in our kiddie pool.  The water was way too cold at first, but soon enough, Ivy and Aidan were in there splashing each other (and me!)  I took some pictures.  Around 5, I took them in and I made dinner while they played in the living room.    On Sunday, I was rushing around trying to get ready, but there were so many things to remember, and then I saw that the sky was threatening rain, imminently.  I was worried that our day at Peter's pool would not work out.  For some foolish reason, I decided to do a huge load of laundry.  I knew I was definitely going to be late, and I thought about calling peter and just cancelling the whole thing.  I was starting to feel downright dismayed.  Then S called, and just the sound of her voice was very calming to me.  We chatted for a few minutes and then I went back inside to call peter.  He had called while I was on the cell, and I called him back.  "Let's delay an hour, to see how the weather looks."  I was amazed that he'd mirrored my thoughts.  An hour later we got in the car and left, right in the middle of a downpour.  Peter's was fun.  The kids were shy at first, but warmed up.  Aidan had a blast riding a rocking horse.  It was an amazing relief from staying home alone with the kids or thinking up stuff for them to do.  After playing for a while we took them to BK for lunch, and then to their play area.  I crawled in, too, even though adults aren't generally allowed.  I helped all the kids (Peter's and mine) find the big purple slide (but it was a bit of a letdown because it wasn't slippery enough).  Then we drove home.  I didn't lay them down for a nap because it was around 3 that we got home.  Instead I laid down on my bed, and Aidan joined me.  I napped a little while he played quietly.    S is in DE, so while it's been hard not to see her, it's not bad, because it's physically impossible.  I'm looking forward to the divorce being final, and at the very least for L to move out, so that I can slowly introduce S into the kids lives.  Also, it will be great to have S over on nights that L has the kids.    Doing all that laundry was a big relief, a real sense of accomplishment.    This Week's To Do List:   haircut / dye  culligan to fix water softener on Tuesday  bike ride or movie or see S on Tuesday night  house appraisal for re-fi on Friday at 2:30p  trim weeds  mow lawn  fix garage door, garage trim  laundry (one more load to do)  SAP backups (Monday through Thursday nights)  Yoga Thursday night  Bike ride Saturday  Hike with hiking class on Sunday at Devil's Den  Half day Thursday for lunch / shopping with S  date with S Friday night (1 month 'anniversary')  date with S Satruday night  Sunday night go to Norwich for training next week  If I actually do half of this, I'll be happy.  I also have to do a change to install a PCI parallel port card into a server, and I have to cover 1-2 war room phone calls for some trojan going around that we're helping to investigate.  I volunteered for Monday night 10p-6a or Wednesday night 10p-6a.
