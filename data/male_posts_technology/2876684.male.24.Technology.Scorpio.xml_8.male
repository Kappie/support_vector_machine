Somehow from there we ended up talking and I found out she stays pretty close by to where I used to stay in Surry Hills and that she goes to Wollongong Uni.  No, I didn't get her number. I didn't even get her name. Does that make me strange? Some people seem to think so! I guess I regarded it as one of those fairly anonymous chats you have when you travel. Maybe I was just tired from training. God I hope I'm not gay. No, I'm just SHY dammit. :P
