Yeah, yeah, I can hear what youre saying, Yeah sure, one entry in his blog we wont see another one for another two years Now, now be nice. But youre probably right.     J                        Whats new with me you ask? Well looks like my stint with my roommate Jeremy is coming to an end. Long story short, hes going back to school, just got laid off from his job, and has decided to take this opportunity to go full time and live on loans and unemployment. And thus, he wants to find his own place on campus. More power to him! I am quite ready to be on my own again as well, so hooray! Its time to celebrate! Well, not just yet. Ive put in an application for a place in Old Towne East, but have not heard back from them yet. Well see how that goes. In the meantime, cross your fingers. Move out date is June 26 th .                    Its  11:47  pm  as I sit here and write this. I recently downloaded (ahem, I mean bought) Room For Squares by John Mayer. Ive heard a few songs on here before, but never the whole album. I love it. Only thing is, it kind of makes me sad It reminds me of last summer when I hung out with my upstairs neighbor Carrie a lot. She got me hooked on John when she let me borrow CD of hers that had him on it. In fact, I think I still have the CD somewhere gotta get that back to her. Anyway, Im sad cause once I move, she wont be 10 feet from me No more of our impromptu wine nights on the porch, or our crazy attempts to break in to the pool at  1 am , and our obnoxiously drunk efforts to go through every high school and college picture she has.     J                        But of course, Im sure well stay friends even after Ive moved, so we can still have wine nights at my new place, wherever that may be.                    Congrats on your graduation Carrie!                    Shes always buzzing, just like
