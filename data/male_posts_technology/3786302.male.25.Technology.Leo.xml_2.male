Mother Nature, Mother India, Mother Teresa, and Mother...women. I personally feel that the direction taken by the human race, towards good or evil, is determined by a woman. And only a woman can stop it, if the world is going towards destruction. A woman is a repository of strength and energy. You learn your first words from a woman. You take your first steps in this world by holding a woman's hand. You choose a woman as your life partner. You turn to a woman when you need strength. But as one rotten fish can spoil the whole pond, today there are some 'rotten' fish that are bringing a bad name to womanhood (As Swami Vivekananda says, "true womanhood consisted in the old-time intensity of trustful and devoted companionship to the husband"). I have seen these so called 'educated' women with the most 'rotten' thoughts that are really making some men lose their respect for women. You might understand more if you read the other articles on this page, as I do not want to bring the same topics here once again. But I have one thing to tell. Swami Vivekananda said once, "O India! Forget not that the ideal of thy womanhood is Sita, Savitri, Damayanti." He categorically asserted that "the women of India must grow and develop in the footprints of Sita, and that is the only way." Indeed, for him, the ideal of Hindu womanhood remained, as these names make it manifestly clear, chastity and loyalty to husband. Development of true womanhood was thus the primary goal of women's education. As Nivedita had written, according to Swamiji, "unless it held and developed the spirit of true womanhood, there could be no education of woman worthy of the name." He declared in Detroit that "the girls of India would die if they like American girls were obliged to expose half their bodies to the vulgar gaze of young men." It is a surprise that the same women today are willing tonot only shed their clothes at the drop of the hat, but even go further without any hesitation just to make more money. For all the women who are voluntarily taking this path, It is a Shame on you and womanhood as a whole. Women have 33% reservation in most places. I used to consider that the very fact that they needed 33% reservation meant that they were weak and cannot compete against men with their talent and will power. But then many women made us proud by reaching to the top posts in this country in various fields, and I was proved wrong. But the very fact that you women are making use of rotten activities to make more money proves that you are still weak. You cannot make a mark for yourself either with your talents or with your skills. Shame on you for resorting to cheap methods to make money. It makes my blood boil when I read such articles about women. It might be because of my respect towards women that was embedded in me from my childhood. For all the women who are not into any such activities, It is high time you get united for a cause for the sake of womanhood. If you do not take an action to eliminate these rotten activities that some of your daughters, sisters, friends, neighbours, etc have taken up, then the day is not far when more and more women will fall trap to their words and women will be nothing but commodities for sale, everywhere, explicitly or implicitly. Raise your voice at the first instance there is an attempt to exploit you or any of your peers or if you see a woman getting into shabby things. Take charge in your hands to retain the respect that some men still have for women in this world.
