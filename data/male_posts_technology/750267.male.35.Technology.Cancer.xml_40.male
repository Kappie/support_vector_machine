The reason why it was amazing, apparently, was how relevant it's search results were. "No matter what you are searching for, there is a good chance the first few search results returned will contain exactly what you're looking for."  I tried it myself, and I had to admit, it was amazing. In fact, I can't even remember the last time I used another search engine. Relevance rules.  I was not the first to discover Google, and I sure wasn't the last. Over the past few years, Google has surprised everyone by becoming the reigning king of search engines. Remember Altavista? Or Lycos? Or HotWired? What ever happened to those guys?   Google = Power  It goes without saying that a high ranking in Google can be worth millions of dollars in advertising and Web traffic. For example, the first Web site listed in a Google search result might expect to receive ten times the Web traffic of the site in the 10th position.  Other search engines realized this fact a year or two ago, and began selling placement in their indexes, sometimes to the highest bidder in an auction. In fact, Yahoo has stopped allowing free listings in some of its business categories. You have to pay if you want to get listed in their directory. Period.  So it's no surprise that people that run commercial Web sites work very hard to get high placement in Google. They play around with different keywords, meta tags, and Web page content to try to find the magic formula. Similarly, search companies such as Google keep their magic formulas secret, to ensure their indexes continue to return the most relevant results.   Search Results Have Become Serious Business  Recently, an Oklahoma-city based company filed a lawsuit against Google because it's Web sites appear to have been intentionally "bumped down" in Google's ranking system. They are suing, in effect, to force Google to rank them higher.  What makes this case interesting, though, is the type of business that has filed the lawsuit. The plaintiff in this case is a "Web site network" that claims they have developed a system that can fool Google into ranking sites higher in its index. They sell their services to Web site operators who want their Web sites to appear near the top of Google search results.  So let me get this straight, their business is that they can trick Google into ranking sites higher? And they are suing because Google caught on to that trick and is actually ranking those sites lower? Frankly, I don't see the problem.   Who Owns Search Results?  Sure, there are those that argue that Google has no right to alter its search results. After all, it should be a level playing field where every Web operator has an equal chance to be listed in Google. No one likes to see a game where the rules are murky, and can change at any time at the whim of an unseen judge. (Well, there are exceptions to that rule. People still watch "Survivor", even though those rules keep changing when the producers don't like the results. But I digress.)  Besides, allowing Google to arbitrarily decide which Web sites gets listed in their results and which do not gives them way too much power. Who knows... they could quietly begin to filter out opinions that they don't agree with (like this one), or perhaps skew results in favor of certain business partners. This is the "information should be free" argument - let search results be unbiased and unfiltered.  But the counter-argument is that Google is popular only because it returns relevant results. If some sneaky "Web networks" figure out a way to beat that system, Google will start to return results that are less relevant to its users (you and I). If anything, Google should be suing this Oklahoma-based company for attempting to reduce the value of its business!  Google is a private company who provides the Web-surfing public with an extremely relevant search engine. That means that they have to work hard to keep out the spammers who want to try and corrupt the results, and I for one am glad they do.   2003 -- Scott J.
