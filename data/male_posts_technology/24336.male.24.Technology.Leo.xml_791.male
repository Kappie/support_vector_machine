     

      Cars I would consider buying at this point in my life:  

Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution 

Subaru Impreza WRX STi 

Pontiac Solstice (unreleased) 

Honda S2000 

Mazda Mazdaspeed Miata 

BMW M Coupe (no longer offered) 

Infiniti G35 Coupe  

It's a shame that I do not feel terribly strong about any of them.
