Granted this isn't Adobe or Final Cut or anything like that.  I bought Pinnacle Studio 9 and I bought the Mega pack.  So when I finally get it installed (and that is a story unto itself) I find there are still portions of the program I can't use because they want me to pay additional money.  This makes me mad.  I still like the software but when you buy the deluxe pack you assume this means you get the deluxe package.  So anyway I shot movies of family and events and such for fun.  But I would like to do it for profit. There are only so many hours in a day.  More later.  I think I will be smart and go to bed.
