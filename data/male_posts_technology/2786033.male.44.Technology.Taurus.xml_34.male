Got him checked in and in the security line in plenty of time for his flight.  -Have a wonderful time, boy!  Arrived in Seattle's "Chinatown"  at about 09:00.  We were hungry to the point of nausea.  We found one restaurant that was open.  Nobody spoke English or Mandarin.  We had some very interesting dim-sum.   To be fair; the pastries and tea were excellent, Mrs. EU loved some of the more "exotic" offerings,  and I'd give high marks for prep and presentation.  I think it was just that I  simply wanted a decent cup of coffee and a donut, and the missus wanted a bowl of noodle soup. -Well, travelers must adapt.    We noted an opening shop across the street, the English sign just said "grocery."  Mrs. EU said, "We can get your shoulder fixed over there." -Apparently the Chinese sign said a  great deal more.    ( NB:  I've been walking around with a completely destroyed rotator cuff for about two years.  I can't lie on that side or use the arm to push down.  Driving a screw, hammering a nail, -even buttering toast is out of the question. Typing isn't exactly a church social either.)  Well, we went in and, two words: FESTER'S LABORATORY!!!!!  There were dried animals of every species.  There were rows of glass cabinets with every piece of every plant that you could possibly imagine.  Behind the counters were drawers. Above the drawers were shelves. Upon the shelves were immense jars.  It was sort of like a dessicated Noah's Ark.  Fortunately, the clerk spoke excellent Mandarin, so we were in business!  She and the missus chatted for some time.  Sadly, they didn't have the exact preparation my wife had in mind, but something even better! -A real live Chinese herb doctor!    This tall wiry gentleman in a perfectly white and pressed coat comes out and leads me back to his exam room.  We sit, and he senses my qi. He then asked me if there was any pain other than my right shoulder? A parlor trick?  Maybe. -I suppose I telegraph some weakness in that shoulder. Anyhow, it was pretty impressive at the time.    He then starts to gather stuff onto about 15 different plates.  I identified two species of oak, one of teak, two of pine, and three of maple. There were also slivers of various mushrooms, twigs, leaves, and etc.   He mixed it and divided it into seven bags.  I was instructed to boil the contents of each bag in a liter of water until there was about a cup of liquid left. Then, to drink the liquid.  Oh, by the way, it's best to let it get luke-warm and then just slam it. -By all means, don't try to taste it.    Well, you might as well tell Eurydice to not look back into Hades, but let me tell you, I've had scotch and coffee that tasted worse.  I place this goo somewhere between a Loch Dhu without the alcohol, and a bad espresso without the acidity.   I just finished dose 5. I'll let you know if it fixes my arm.
