I went to class this morning at 8am. It was a short 2 hours, just reviewing. Remember how I didn't go to class on Tuesday because I had to frantically finish my other classes report. Well I got back my test from last Saturday and to my surprise I recieved a B. He said the final shouldn't make much difference in the final grade unless you are border line. I think I am border line between an A and B. I have to do well on the final so I can snatch that A. I have class again at 1pm- 3pm. Can't wait...snoooze :)  My parents are working on Vanessa's catering. Smells good. I think Franz, her husband is picking it up at 3pm. Meryl is at Waffles. She will be home also at 3pm.  I read all your previous posts. I haven't been on here for a while. :) All that matters is I am here now. Right...  Bugoy is looking at me. It's cause I have his squeeky shoe toe. He loves things that squeek!!  I can't wait to see your new laptop. I am sure you love it already!! I am sad I dropped mine. There are sometimes I want to use it and it's not there :( oh wells... I guess I will buy one sooner or later.  I can't until the new program of Weight Watchers start. I think it is what I need to revitalize myself with the program. I am very excited about it. Also about Curves. I can't wait to enroll! Dawn and I will be checking in out after WW on Wednesday. Maybe that we can go on Friday so you can check it out with me. I would like that.  It is almost twelve and I have class in an hour. I am going to take a shower again and get my things together. Talk to you later. Love you!
