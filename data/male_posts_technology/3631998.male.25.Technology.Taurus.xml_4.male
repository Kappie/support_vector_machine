But since you can create your station for free and themusic quality is good, I gave it a try. And I must say this : COOL!!!  Their casting is smooth and works well. I already have something like 2-3 Gb of MP3s at my work computer just to keep the variety going, but withbroadband internet acess and the radio I'm pretty sure my horizon of musichas just exploded. Another thing on  urlLink LAUNCHcast  is that you can rate almost everything, from genre to artist, albums and song. With that in place they'll keep playing the stuff you like and avoid what you don't like. If they're going to sell that information, or use it to clean their buttocks I don't really care. I want a soundtrack to work with and I don't care about anadvertising here and there.So if you want to check my station  urlLink click here
