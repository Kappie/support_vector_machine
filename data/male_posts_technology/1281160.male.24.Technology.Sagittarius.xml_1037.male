In this book, Dr.Kalam provides insights about his interaction with young minds of India. Dr.Kalam has taken case-studies from almost all spheres of India to illustrate how the young people in particular the students think about their dream to live in a developed Nation.  Dr.Kalam see his Role-model through celebraty leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Albert Einstein etc. Dr.Kalam has spread the message of National Integration in every page of this book. One important message Dr.Kalam points out in this book is that amalgamation of Science and Religion would make an enriched nation.  "When A.R.Rahman sings Vande Matram, he is seen as an Indian not as a Muslim". This statement made me to think about a scene from the Movie Kovil(Although it was a comedy scene, the message was very powerful). Dr. Kalam assures only the young Indian People can make the dream to happen "India 2020" (a developed Nation). A developed Nation can happen only when a country is self-sufficient in education, defence, non-poverty and social scenario.  India is rich in natural resources. Only if we tap and use the natural resources in an effective and efficient way, we can able to become a powerful nation. An example, Dr.Kalam points out is the Jamshedpur Steel Plant.   Instead of me saying all those points, I recommend all the members to read this book compulsarily. This book is not just to Ignite the young minds, but our minds(all the Indians) too!
