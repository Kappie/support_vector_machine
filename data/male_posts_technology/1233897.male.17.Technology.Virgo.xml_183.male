We started creating 'pyro art' or something in the air with WD40 by catching the flame with it and moving the stream all over the place then passing the flame back and forth from person to person. Hey, did you know that melting plastic bags make a really cool 'ziiiiiiiing' sound when they drip? O, or did you know that glowsticks explode when you toss them in a fire? (LOL)  Come Saturday, Cam and I went over to the Gadeholt's house from when 'Uncle' Greg, 'Auntie' Irene, Timy and we went to Multnomah Falls (3rd highest in N. America) and climbed 8 miles from the base up to Larch Mountain. The entire assent was something like a 4,900 foot increase in elevation. The average grade of the trail we followed was 13.75%. After the fourth hour or so, Cam, Timy and I discovered that it was actually easier to run up certain parts of the trail than to walk up. :) The scenery was spectacular though - myriads of little waterfalls running down the stream on either side of the trail. At one point, we spent a good 20 minutes hurtling boulders into part of the stream... When I stopped for a moment and asked the cliff face (the direction that I was looking) why we were doing it, Uncle Greg responded "Because it's there". HAHA   Man school's backing up and I've got even more h/w than usual... have no idea why I'm even taking time to write this (lol) Goodnight.
