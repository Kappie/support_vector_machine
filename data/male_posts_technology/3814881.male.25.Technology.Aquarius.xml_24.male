    
        This is my first attempt at the blog.  Just a few introductory comments about what I hope to accomplish here are in order.  I'm looking forward to an online forum for publishing some observations I make now and then.  More specifically, observations regarding Biblical Studies, books and music I enjoy, and the good life in Central Pennsylvania.  I'm going to try very hard to avoid allowing this to become an online diary or to succumb to "lonely soulism".  I'm not that interesting of a person.    I hope you don't mind if I indulge myself every once in a while and share stories of some of my adventures though.  More of a "(b)log" than a diary, if you would.
