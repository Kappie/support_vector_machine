She seems awfully shy/quiet/inexperienced maybe. It was kinda boring and slow. But I figured, what the heck, maybe give her some time and we might all just learn something. The second half was basically conversational practise and some exercises. It was conducted my an older teacher but at least she was more proactive with the class. Much better I would say.  I left realising I knew more of content compared with the other students but more out of practiced. Plus my memory with vocabs and some grammars of what I learnt aren't that greath either. Haiz ... looks like I'll have something to work on from now on, in and out of camp.
