He is saying that tomorrow, 8/3, he is to find out what is wrong with his knee and when they are sending him home.  He is hoping they send him home on a med 40 in about 3 months, but says they most likely will send him home on a med 200 in a month.  Of course, I did learn two things from this vacation. First, I am never going to complain about the weather here in Arizona again!  OMFG! The humidity in Louisville was killing me!  Second, I am never traveling American Airlines again.  Not only was my flight delayed by 2 hours because of a computer failure but my luggage arrived 4 hours after I did.  Oh well, guess we live and learn and if you learn something new everyday then it is a good day.  Blog at ya'll later...
