Looks very decent and pleasant, but then how far it will be legible to the HR's who are the ones who will receive ur resume is a small question which popped in my mind and so think about it too. If he happens to be a techie guy with a little sweep on mark up langauages, then he will surely be happy to have u, but other way?
