The cinema was almost full, filled with many couples and lonely people like me. This is the first time i watched a midnight show alone in the crowd. The movie made me realised, like many things in life, simple things like sunshine, good weather did not come on its own. Illustrated in the movie, it was doomsday forecast. Indeed, global warming is an issue that is troubling many nations' geologist, however, few nations actually attempt to do something. Emissions are still high, and many still concentrated on their own economic development and contribute to the global warming.  In the recent years, more and more hollywood movies are moving towards doomsday forecast. "Independence day", "The core", "The perfect storm", etc. They, didn't do it for nothing, probably like what was illustrated in the movies, someday, these might happen. The question thus becomes, "When will it be?" We shouldn't just ignore warnings and take it as, somebody else will do the job. Alas, its just a norm that people behave this way.  Unlike all the movies, romance that bossomed, i doubt if the real scenario actually take place, i will have the chance to have some romance. If i don't have it now, i probably won't have it later. Isn't that so, hap?  Its late.. almost 3 in the morning. See you later, hap.  Love, DJ
