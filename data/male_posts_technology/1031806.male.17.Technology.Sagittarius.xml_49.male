I didn't know it but apperantly the Company is being bought in November or December, and changing it's name (though still being the same thing). It's too bad I'm only an intern, I think it'd be cool to be here for that.  After the meeting they had cake, and they had Carrot Cake! It's seriously the best stuff in the world... with it's wonderful creame cheese frosting... oh man I've had like.... 5 pieces (hehe - there was a lot extra). I'm glad I was hungry!
