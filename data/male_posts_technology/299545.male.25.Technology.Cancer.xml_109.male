Today, after sleeping late and lounging around the apartment, we went downtown to the  urlLink Boston Arts Festival . We heard some great jazz, the Boston Wind Symphony, and saw lots of exhibits by random artists. I think I have pretty eclectic art tastes -- I generally seem attacted to Art Deco, Asian, and Modern/Contemporary. It was nice to see everything -- it gave me the idea to try and take some good pictures, get them printed in black and white, and put them up in our bathroom (which happens to be black and white and has no decoration in it).   Tomorrow, Jen and I are going to the Red Sox game -- I won the ticket lottery at work. Every few days, someone emails out to everyone in the Cambridge office if the company tickets are available -- somehow I actually was the first person to email back this time, so I got them. We'll be in a box seat on the right field line. Yay!
