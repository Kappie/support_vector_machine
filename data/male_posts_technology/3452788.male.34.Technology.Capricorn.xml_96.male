Nikki had to bury it in the garden, so I’m sure will find the decomposed carcass sometime in the future.  Anyway, we decided to buy more interesting and less sensitive fish from the store.  We ended up with neon tetras, and other fish I don’t know the names of (or really care, so I make up names like See-thru and Red-eye), 7 total.  The fish food and equipment supplier had a brochure, titled something like Fintastic - Fish are Fun!  In it, there is a blurb about how in (use big announcer voice) Major University Studies, people with fish were found to be more relaxed and less tense than others.  So I sit, watching a group of creatures collectively smaller than a pickle, with roughly the same mental capacity, swim in endless circles around in a small cage with glass walls and fake plants.  They depend on people, creatures outside their universe of which they have no concept, for all food and care.  Meanwhile we sit and observe their movements, secure and confident in our mastery over the natural world.  Having been taken from their friends at the store, they endure a meaningless life of several months waiting for either death by bloating, or for a curious cat to pluck them from their watery tedium, swat them around while they suffocate, then eat them in a few crunchy bites.  Yeah, that makes me feel much more relaxed about things.  Doesn’t remind me of my own distorted concepts about life at all, does it?  Real important place in the universe there.  Rock on, little fishies, you inspire me.  Anne says it’s not like they were taken directly from the Amazon River, and even if they were, they just would have been eaten by bigger fish anyway, so why not enjoy them?  Why not, indeed. I think we should throw in a predator fish, watch the carnage, then cook his ass for dinner.
