They take both candidates to task on their ads, statements and speeches.  I've read a few articles/analysis' up there so far, and they certainly seem to be neutral, not necessary praising and/or villifying particular candidate.  A nice refreshing break from the political rhetoric and shit-slinging that's all too common in our Democratic process.
