This one is for the June and July birthdays - which includes my Uncle Frank, Aunt Donna, my sister Marisa, and my cousin Melissa. I had to cut out of there after grabbing some food and visiting - very early (wasn't kicking yet before I left) becuase I had a super-huge software release of my software due out to my client that wasn;t anywhere near ready to go out. Ugh. I'm actually still working on it (it's actually Wednesday already and the party was last Sunday). Too bad since it was such a nice day! The pictures weren't that great since I left early and was preoccupied about getting out of there... but I got a few...  These pictures are of my cousin Melissa (on the left) and my sister Kristen the one that invited my to go on vacation with her. Trinidad - I can't wait! The second picture was taken while I was playing pool with Melissa and her boyfriend, Alex. He's such a good guy; I'm so happy with for Melissa.   urlLink    urlLink     Younger cousins - the first one below is me and Ben, my uncle Frank's son. His younger brother Frank, Jr. is the youngest in my generation (and I'm the oldest, hehe). I tried getting Franky Jr. in a pic but he was just waking up from a nap and kinda cranky still - though he is almost always such a happy 2-year old! Oh well. The other pic is of me and Sabrina. She's growing up so beautiful... she's my Uncle Tony's daughter. We were at his house this time. Melissa is also his daughter. All my cousins are beautiful - I'm proud pf them in many ways!    urlLink    urlLink      My dad hanging out  urlLink     The food was great, as usual. We have lots of good cooks in my family, including my mom and Uncle Tony, who is about to open a nice resturant in Newark, NJ. You may see some pictures of that soon, too! He's having a special opening night for just the family on August 6th - right before Trinidad! ...I love my life.   Loading up the eats  urlLink
