Take your largest date ever and sell it to someone else.  Looking at other people's blogs, I realize that I have a shopping list for getting a better blog. The items are as follows:  1. Get a decent looking template, preferably something that looks like it wasn't chosen from Blogger directly (mine was, of course)  2. Write more often, prefereably starting in 2001. (I wonder if there's a way to retroactively fill the blog to make it look as though I had been blogging since the beginning--In March of 2001, I'll submit my analysis that we are vulnerable for terrorist attacks. Someone will discover me, I'll be on CNN in three months as the prophet-blogger, then be exposed and humiliated in front of billions when it is discovered I haven't really been blogging that long.)  3. Figure out what is wrong with what little archives I do have. (the earliest stuff I can't access for some reason, getting an error message that says it doesn't have such-and-such a page)  4. Stay up to date on some issue that actually allows people to relate to me. (Currently, as you might tell, I'm only interesting to those who have known me personally. To know me is to love me, of course.)  So there you have the beginnings of the great blog this will undoubtedly become.
