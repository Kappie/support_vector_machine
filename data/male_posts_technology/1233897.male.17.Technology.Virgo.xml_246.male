It's a '95 Toyota Camry LE. It's the newer body style (a plus over the other one), it's got like, one tiny scratch, it drives great and it's just all around a wonderful car... Except for one fatal flaw... It stinks of cig smoke. Yeah, it sux bad... that stuff doesn't come out ever, oh you can clean the interior as well as you want, but leave it out in the sun long on a hot day and that smell will come seeping out of the metal in the roof and make the car reek again. Trouble is that among my dad's slowly failing senses, he's partially lost his sense of smell so he doesn’t know how bad it really is. Plus the fact that he's the type of guy that won't believe that there's a hole in the middle of the road ahead of him until he slides right into it himself, so we can tell him all we want that the smell's not coming out and he's gonna try to get it out anyway. I feel really bad about pressing the issue because whenever I talked about the other car, I was almost always complaining (And very justifiably, that car had a butt load of problems), but he spent like, 5 hours at the dealer's auction just to get this car for me and I want to show my appreciation for that. But then again as Andrew aptly said, I "won't ever have to smoke, just keep the car for two years and it'll do the same thing."  Ah the problems of life...
