He's still his old self.  Cooked some parmasean chicken Friday night for the room mates and Meghan.  Chicken was a little bland and bony but very juicy.  Meat was just falling off the bone.  It was good but it need a little more to give it a kick.  I think I put too much garlic salt in the mashed potatoes.  It kinda fermented and stank towards the next day as I was searching for left overs to eat for breakfast.  It was still good to eat though.  I enjoyed quite thoroughly.  Friday was drinkfest and video game night.  Losta fun.  There was also a bunch of talking and joke telling.  I wish I could describe the Irish accent that Jerry, my room mate can do and say the joke.  It needs the accent to bring the punch line that much more oomph to be funnier.  Played some basketball (NBA Live 2004) and Halo and just a little bit of Need for Speed Underground.  NFSU, brought back some memories.  Friday was a good night.  Someone got pretty drunk.  Let's just say it was a good time and leave it at that.  Saturday was good as well.  I shared a Chicago (at least I don't think thery're in any other state) food staple.  If you are from Chicago, you know of Portillos.  Good stuff.  Well actually we ordered from Barnellis.  Portillos is like the chicago itialian sausage/beef sandwiches or the burgers or the hot dogs with the onion rings or fries.  Barnellis is the pasta, regular sandwich place that also serves the Chicken Ceasar Pita.  Good sandwich.  surprisingly, their pita bread has been better than par lately.  It's been lack luster the few times before this.  It didn't really crumble or anything.  It was good.  We then went to my parents house to say hi and see what they were up to and get directions for my cousin's birthday party (there were two parties merged into one).  I didn't get invited to help out in the garden Meghan did.  Although it was said half jokingly, half serious, I thought that was very nice of my parents to make sure Meghan felt comfortable.  We retreated and got some TCBY because someone has been wanting that for like six weeks now, maybe even more.  Straberry shortcake, good stuff.  Caribou coffee was right next door so we went ahead and got something there as well.  We then went back to the apartment to relax for a bit.  I knew that my family gathering would be, let's see, how can I word this...a pleasant drain on your energy.  It usually was a crazy time.  I dont think I could have prepared her more if I tried.  I didn't really try, I just kinda let it happen to see what would happen.  We got there thanks to the directions that my dad drew out for us.  Everyone was already there.  I would think that it would be intimidating for someone new.  I wanted to see how she would interact with my family as well as how my family liked her.  We got there and let's just say that they really liked each other.  Rarely do I bring any of my friends to meet the entire family not to mention people I am persuing.  I only did that lately because I felt comfortable enough to share to them that this is who my family is.  This is where I come from.  These are  who I am related to.  This is where I get my values and beliefs.  These are the people that are the closest to me.  The last time that I did merge  my friends and family into one gathering was my 22nd birthday.  I had a bunch of people over.  All of my family were there and then later on in the night, my friends showed up.  It was a good time, my dad being all drunk along with my uncles and having them interact with some of my closest friends (who were also drunk).  I thought was was pretty cool.  Granted there weren't a lot of people at this particular party, it's still my family acting like they usually are.  I was just glad that my family made her feel welcome and she was having a good time.  She really had a good time and my family did like her.  Sunday was just not a good time.  It started out bad but things are better now.  I know I said some things that I shouldn't have.  I am sorry for the stuff that I said that hurt, intended or not intended.  I am glad that we worked this out already.  Water under the bridge?  Not a sinking ship?  Yeah....  Besides Sunday and it's wierdness, I had a great weekend.  Sorry to have "missed" a day here, but apparently it's a good thing when one does miss a day in "blogging"
