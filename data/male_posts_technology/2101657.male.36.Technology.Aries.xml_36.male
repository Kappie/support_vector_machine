I had an eye exam after work, and my pupils are still extremely dilated, so everything is a little fuzzy/blurry.  Plus, I'm not wearing my glasses, and from what the eye doctor said, I don't need them.    Talk about a shock!   I've worn glasses for the last oh.....28yrs? and suddenly I don't have to wear them? Wow! I need to get some sunglasses! :-)  It sounds like after a few weeks, my eyes will have adjusted and I won't have any of the weirdness of looking at the world w/o glasses any more.  I'm no longer visually impaired! WOOHOO!
