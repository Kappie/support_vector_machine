Since my last post, I have been able to do two runs due to strenuous physical labor being done last week and lack of time.  Update for 3/24/04 This was the only run I got to do in South Chicago.  Me and another guy who was staying up there journeyed to a little safer neighborhood to run.  We ended up running at a high school track along with the varsity and junior track teams.  We enjoyed running with them while receiving comments like, "Run white boy run" and "You runnin' too fast white boy".  I ran just under 7 miles in 60 minutes.  It was hard since my body was tired with all the work we were doing last week.  Nonetheless, it was good to run and it was a good workout.  Update for 3/28/04 I got to run in my first race today as I participated in the Heart Mini-Marathon with Natalie and Lisa.  There were many factors that led to me not feeling so well on the course including sickness, exhaustion, heat, and lack of running most of last week.  Either way, I finished a little bit below half of the pack at just under 1 hour 30 minutes.  My official results read on the  urlLink website  (www.heartmini.org) as  1582 Tyler Woebkenberg  M  24 CINCINNAT OH 1:27:50  9:27  63/93   M1924   1149/2088 M. I would say that it stands for me finishing as #1582 (out of 3661), my name, my gender, my age, where I'm from, my time, my split time, my place in my group, my group (male 19-24), and my place compared to all males in the 15K.  All in all, it was an awesome day to run, it was great practice at a real race, and I don't regret it despite how bad I felt at some points on the course.  My legs felt great despite not running much in the last week and the only thing holding me back was my head cold.  I was able to finish incredibly strong at an almost sprint pace which helped me to make up the 5 minutes I spent walking.  5 more weeks until the marathon!
