Or something.  Just watched an episode of the West Wing and it's got me thinking about the delicious way that the cast of characters interacts one with another. I mean, holy cow, this show consists entirely of people who  do not exist!  I know, I know, that's what fiction is, but the fact is, they might as well be real, because it's not without some twinge of sadness that I remind myself each week that this is just a show. I consider myself a normal person, someone who doesn't get all caught up in something silly, and here I am, totally captivated week after week by a television show. I could never meet any of the actors, because I would be just like the people actors always tell stories about--the ones that come up to them on the street and call them by their character name and ask them questions that give away the fact that the people think they actually are the characters. I would actually ask them what it's like working in the White House and whether they think there's a chance that one of them could be president, since the current president (I'm talking about the one on the TV show) is ending his second term soon.  I'm afraid for when the characters that I'm going to be writing about become real, because I'm going to cry for them, worry about whether they will make the right decisions, know that some of them won't. I'll be tense when they're tense, elated when they're elated, and sleepy when they're sleepy. At least we'll all be on the same schedule.  So Elliott Smith. I feel like I should write this part in second person, because a lot of the thoughts I've had over the last two weeks since he killed himself have been directed at him, are things I would ask him if he were here right now. Or I guess they can't be answered by anyone but him. Why does he have to prove out the idea that great artists are often very tormented people? Why does he have to rob himself of the opportunity to continue making beautiful music? Why can't artists balance the art they produce and the life they lead? I have to assume that the balance is possible.  I also have to assume that the poor guy didn't feel very good about things when he did it. I think the road he found himself on may have been a filled with good times, but a shadow of depression covered everything. That's what makes him a sympathetic character. On the other hand, suicide is the consummate act of selfishness, wherein a person loses sight of his/her talents to the point that he/she ceases to value life over the absence of life, fighting one's problems over giving into destructive impulses, and so on.  So think about this: what's better, taking heroin and suffering from the effects of drugs and a poor approach to health, or killing oneself? I would have to think that the act of taking drugs is more minor thn the act of taking one's own life, though neither makes a person elegible for any semblance of honor. Still, there are degrees, and it's interesting that it seems (it seems because I don't know enough to use a stronger term) that  a lot of suicide victims are at the moment of suicide attempting to get off or stay off drugs. Isn't it ironic that rehabilitation can be a gateway to choices far more serious?  The primary objection to the implication that rehab could ever be deemed a bad thing is that I'm not taking into account those people who give up drugs and stay clean, going on to having a great life, as well as those people whose drug habits lead them to death.  This whole topic, a philosophy unto itself, is not the point. The point is, I wish Elliott Smith had not killed himself, perhaps for the following reasons, broken down by their proportion of the entire amount of regret that I have:   1. 50%: Purely Selfish desire to have his music creation around for more years than we ended up with; 2. 30%: Somewhat selfish desire to see Elliott Smith be successful in both the artistic and the private realms of his/her life--probably related to my liking his music (and although he often denied the connection) and the man behind the lyrics and beautiful melodies; 3. 20%: Purely unselfish desire to deflect the grief and pain of his close friends and family, who undoubtedly must be anguished over his loss.  God Bless you, Elliott, for a life shortened, but lived nonetheless. I value the music and the feelings I've had listening to it. That's pretty much all I can say about it.
