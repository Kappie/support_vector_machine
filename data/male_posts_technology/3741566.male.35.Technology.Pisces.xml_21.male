I'm talking about truly asking myself hard questions and going about answering them to myself. Some of my earliest epiphanies about serious topics came quite early in life.   I think I was around four or five and there was a very dramatic event that had just occurred with my mother. I had been playing around in the bathroom and had broken some teeth out of her comb. I believe it was the next day that she found out what had happened and flew into a rage. In order to punish her young boy she flung me down on the sofa and grabbed my "blankie" - At that time my "blankie" was a stuffed bunny, although it could have been an actual blanket like my two children have, that I carried around everywhere with me. I had it since I was maybe three. As every parent knows the "blankie" connection is a powerful one to young kids. - She then proceeded to tell me that if I couldn't learn to respect her property that she was going to teach me the consequences. She then proceeded to rip the bunny in half and throw it away.  It was the next day that my young mind was trying to find reason in what seemed an insane occurrence. So I asked myself a few questions. Why had she done what she did and what conclusions could I make from it. That might seem like deep questions to most for a 4-5 year old, but, it was the type of thing that was normal to me.   I asked myself those questions for a long time without an answer that satisfied me. I would come up with normal young boy answers but even then I knew that they were insufficient to explain why. By age six, there had been sufficient other dramatic events similar to the one above that involved my biological mother to let me know that this was certainly pattern behavior.   It was at age 6 that some answers finally came. The answers were simple.   Why did she do it? She wasn't happy. Not just generically unhappy at the moment, but unhappy as a whole. The problem didn't lie with me but with her. It wasn't something I did or said that triggered events, it was her. That was when it hit me that most kids have this silly notion that their parents are always right and this notion doesn't disappear for a long time. It is a completely irrational belief, but one that is understandable in a simple 6 year old mind. I had overcome that irrational belief early and because of that, it opened up whole new ways of thinking about life in general. I'd like to say that was a changing point in my life, but it wasn't. It was just that special point back in time that lead me to be able to lead a more normal rational life today.   By this time you have read my other posts and are saying, but your life is a mess! How can you possibly say that you lead a rational normal life? Well, what I wrote before was more the simple reality of my current situation void of my reactions to the actual events. I wrote it so you could understand the situation I am in today. Knowing the actual situation, you could then read later about how I view it and how I deal with things on a daily basis. Maybe it might help someone else.   Back to the subject  Although that revelation at 6 wasn't life altering at the time, it did enable me get through the next 10 years without committing suicide. How so? Well I understood, really understood, that unreasonable expectations about having a perfect life with a perfect mother only hurt me. The next big epiphany came much later. We can say for now that my life didn't get better over the next 10 years. Severe physical abuse (not sexual)and verbal abuse were a constant in my life and I began to develop very unhealthy reactions to it. I know now what to call it, but at the time I didn't. I would mope, I would feel sorry for myself (some would say rightly so), and I would agonize over my situation. It turned me into a very angry young man. I was self righteous, rude, angry, hostile, and sullen. I'm sure I was a complete joy to be around.   Some of the things I would think to myself would be:  1 Because Dea ( 2 Because Dea said that all men were the slime of the earth, and all the father figures in my life seemed to substantiate her claim, it meant that I too must be slime since I was a guy. 3 Because my life had no direction it was simply awful and I couldn't stand it. I might die any minute from the shame and humiliation of it all 4 Because I failed at school I must be stupid 5 because I am such a miserable useless failure or a boy, that I certainly will always be one 6 That happiness is something that is given not earned. I can't be happy unless I am doing something fun, entertaining, etc.   All of these thoughts made me angry inside. Irrational self talk always meant that I had to be right. That there had to be a right and wrong. Because if I was wrong it meant that I was bad and that would be awful.  Just after turning 16, I got an idea that most kids do. My idea was that I had to remove myself from the circumstances around me. The line of thinking is that by removing myself I will make it easier to be happy. Oops. Grass is greener over there. How foolish a notion. Looking back, although I know the logic is faulty, it did withdrawal me from a very bad situation and because of that, I put myself in a place to start fixing myself.  One month after my 17th birthday I joined the Army. All my problems followed me of course since the problem was me. Although I didn't have physical and verbal abuse in my face everyday, it didn't stop the damaging things I did to myself. It can really get stupid.  I wasn't as physically capable as other men in the army so I must be worthless. Never mind that I was far from a weakling etc. I wasn't as fast as others running, so it meant I must be less than they were. Never mind that I was far from the slowest.  My expectations going into the Army were such that I never expected a worthless person like me to succeed so therefore I didn't. It was a disaster. I "can't" became a word I was becoming way too familiar with. I would move from one self fulfilling prophecy to another. Two years later found me out of the Army and Married to a German woman that I wasn't even in love with (a story for a later time).  I am now 19 and just as angry as I ever was, although I was asking myself serious questions about myself and life, I was too angry and hateful to listen for answers. It was at this time that I started to wake up out of a fog. After destroying a marriage that I just knew wouldn't work (sarcasm), I was on my own again and looking down the long barrel that was life. I knew I had to do something. I didn't want to go through life feeling miserable....  It was that want, that desire to actually do something about the situation, that started the change. It was then, when I was about 20 years old that my next life altering epiphany. I call it my first universal truth. A universal truth is a truth that cannot be proven wrong under any circumstances. It was so profound to me that it started me thinking in new ways.  "People do what they want to do. People don't do what they don't want to do" That is an original from me. Right now you are saying well duh, or so what!  If you honestly believe that statement, TRULY believe that statement, it will have an affect on how you relate to other people throughout your life. Let me give an example to help you understand.  EVENT: You call up your girlfriend/boyfriend and they say they can't go out tonight because they have clothes to wash and other chores.  Someone who doesn't understand the statement above, usually misses the basic point that she/he didn't want to be with them. If they had, they would have worked around any obstacles in the way. This might be a one time thing that has no overall value or it might be a trend that the other person should be aware of. In listening to their words instead of their actions, the other person might be headed down a relationship with significant issues from the start. The problem is that most people lie. "oh I really want to see you but I have to do laundry" is a lie, period.    I believe the above statement so I KNOW she has made a choice between seeing me and doing clothes. She has chosen to do what she wants to do. Since she doesn't obviously want to see me, I accept the reality of the situation and realize that I have two choices. If I want a relationship with her/him, I better figure out how to be more attractive than doing laundry, or I need to just move on to another relationship since her/his interest in this relationship is obviously lacking.  Because I believe in the universal truth, it eliminates the unknown for me. I'm not asking myself if she REALLY wanted to do clothes more than see me. I already know the answer. Now it is just up to me as to how I'd like to react to it.  So how did this help me in my life?  Well it helped me weed through all the bullshit thrown at you from other people. I stopped listening to people's words and started looking at the reality. It showed who around me was sincere. I could match words with actions and when they didn't match, I would move on   So now I had another tool to help me be happy. Was I? Not hardly! I was missing one more answer to my problem. By this time, I certainly wasn't doing to bad. I knew better than set large unreasonable expectation of people (still hadn't learned that I was setting smaller ones constantly)so that helped me somewhat in dealing with letdowns in life. i also had learned a universal truth that helped me see through a lot of garbage that clouds other peoples judgement.   Stay tuned for Part 2 of how to be happy and read what the last component was.
