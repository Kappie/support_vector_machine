It's like I'm constantly banging my head against a wall of incompetence. A huge part of me is on the verge of just packing it all in and going home.  One thing is definite. I am not going to start any more companies with people I have never worked with before. So far with the exception of wayne who I have already worked with, I have yet to find a single person that I have been impressed or even satisfied with in work.  My whole life seems to be spent now double checking and then having to redo everything I have asked anyone else to do.  Now what? I don't know what to do. I honestly don't and the constant low level stress I have is going to end up killing me if I don't do something soon...
