First of all, Ewing represented in Montille, headed by Autumn Lane and its Associates.  I was RUNNING the burrtang tables with my partner Matt, even though I was carrying his ass. And we were drankers, lemme tell you we killed kegs and rocked the ice block shots.  The stupid pushover Montville po's showed around 12 and made us move cars.  This is when I try to help J to the B (John the Bomb) out and he ends up driving his piece into a ditch.  Doug meanders over to try to help out JTB by PUSHING his car out of the ditch (for real Doug. what were you thinking?)and breaks his wing off ("oh man I can fix that tomorrow...yeah thats nothing but clips and glue" doug, there were bolts sticking of the hood).  We go back to a party FULL of nut ass dudes trying to fight.  Apparently, roid rage is waaay cool in the Ville.  I have to mention the rowdy motherfucker in the black wifebeater last night who stood and screamed in me and Obeazy's face for a full 5 minutes. That boy was kind of insane hahahahaha. About 2 or 3 my man Cotten takes a header off the top stair and plummets to a neck cracking near death and splits his HEAD open. Blood everywhere.  Mama Bears is mad. So kids are fighting, puking, passing out, funneling, hooking up, and cracking their heads open.  Obviously, this was the best party I have been to in a loooong time. The boys kept some weird old ladies warm for the night, and Luke was bullied into asking for her number. Way to go boys!  So now we're being stupid around Autumn as per usual watching some weird ass movie and chuckling. Summer is going to be...cool.   fuck you and the horse you came in on Smashley
