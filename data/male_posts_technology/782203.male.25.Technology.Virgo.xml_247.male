It's showing from the 7 - 10th of May at 9 pm but I cant make it on the 9th with a friend cos I got company barbecue on that day. :(   Define pathetic : When you need to make a mass plea online on your blog to get someone to go to the movies with you.  On another note, I am starting to develop a fear of black holes, you know those things in space with such intense gravity that they suck in light even. But can't tell you why.
