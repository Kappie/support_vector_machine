For instance:  "I awake to find no peace of mind, I said, how do you live as a fugitive?  Down here where I cannot see so clear.  and I said, what do I know? Show me the right way to go"  Now I'm not one for interpreting lyrics of songs (a lot of them barely make any sense), but there is something that hits a chord when I hear those lyrics from lead singer, Chris Martin. It is like something you can feel but cannot define. Something sad. There's a profound sadness in those words that I somehow relate to, but I don't know why.   But we never know, right? We never know anything.
