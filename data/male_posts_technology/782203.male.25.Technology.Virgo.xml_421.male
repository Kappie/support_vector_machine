BTW things I would really love to have for XMAS:  1. Take a Look in the Mirror by Korn 2. Tenacious D by Tenacious D 3. Any book on Led Zeppelin  4. Play by Moby  I can't be any more subtle.  A friend asked me to go clubbing with him and his friends on Xmas Eve. Quite hesitant cos I am not really the clubbing type, let's just say that some people are just not born to dance. But the alternative is to stay at home and stare at my xmas tree with my 2 dogs, which i been doing every year. Damm I just hate dilemmas like this.
