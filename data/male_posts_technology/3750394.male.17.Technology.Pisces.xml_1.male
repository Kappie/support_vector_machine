I really hate how long it takes the CBE to get paperwork done, I handed in my transfer forms in triplicat :P 4 weeks ago, and they just got it done.  It took them 2 months for me to get my CBE Employee ID number :P, o well, what can ya do.  Right now, im off to Boston Pizza to eat my heart out :D  TTY all later  Eric
