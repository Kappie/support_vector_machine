I bought a book about two years ago that is a collection of his letters to various people, including his parents, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, and Ford Madox Ford. Truthfully, I don't know all that much about Gertrude Stein, though I love to tell people that Hemingway hung out with her when they all lived in Paris in the 20's. This accomplishes a few things: first, if they know Gertrude Stein, they're impressed enough to want to read "A Moveable Feast"; and second, if they don't know anything about her, they think I'm better read than I am. Seriously, though, I would like to understand a little better what role she played in the literary movement of the 20's and later. Based on the letters Hem wrote (our relationship has developed to the point that I feel okay calling him "Hem"), Ms. Stein was a great writer, and a good friend. Here's a short  urlLink Stein Biography  I found (the picture, I think, bares this strange resemblance to the musician Elliott Smith).  Here are some things I really like about Hemingway, based on his letters:  1. He always is begging people to come to wherever he is and do something. He's social.  2. He misspells things, uses slang profusely, and basically doesn't give a crap about the correctness of the letter he writes--when he's writing an informal letter, of course. He could be pretty pretentious, if he wanted to be, since he always considered himself a writer.  3. He has his doubts. It's so humanizing to read parts of letters that basically express the thought "Do I really have what it takes to be a good writer?" To have a future Pulitzer Prize and Nobel Prize winner writing to people that he's not even sure if this whole writing thing is going to work out is an inspiration to me. I constantly think the same things, and I guess his method for dealing with that (at least initially--not the last years of his life) was good--to work and write and see what happens--is the right method for me, too.  4. He wrote a lot of letters.  That's something I aspire to.  Anyway, it's shorter than I envisioned it, but there you have it. Read the letters if you ever get the chance.
