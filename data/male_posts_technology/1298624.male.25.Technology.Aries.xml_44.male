I have just survived the "midnight shift" and I am now attempting to finish my regular hours that I do on friday (which is 7:00 am to 12:00 pm). I will be dead tired. I can feel already in my bones. It seems as if another form of blood has taken over my body...to keep me functioning as I furiously type this post.   I was surprised to notice that I didn't fall asleep (somewhat) during my watch. There were times when I would dose off (especially around 3:30 - 4:00), but for the most part, I stayed awake. The incessant pinging of Unicenter helped tremendously in creating this state of mind. I feel as if I should be asleep...but, at the same time, have the energy to go on. I feel the fatigue deep in my bones. It's disconcerting to feel this fatigue when you know you have the energy to pull a few more hours. This reminds me of a saying...."the calm before the storm..." I attribute that quote to almost everything that requires expenditure with the risk of collateral damage. In this case, what I feel right now will be magnified ten times when I finally lay down and head off to sleep.  Word of warning (more for me than anybody else). Do not ever drink coffee again. I'm sure the toilet will appreciate it.
