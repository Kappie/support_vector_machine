Whether we are comfortable with it or not, we are the most powerful country the world has ever seen. Do we use that power to shut ourselves off from the world, turn inward and merrily go along, fiddly dee, tomorrow is another day? I think that we are 50 years past the time when the oceans could protect our country from the world (see 9/11). Like it or not, we have the opportunity to raise the world's standard of living, to bring hope, elightenment and cash flow to billions who would never know the joys of good dental hygene or low infant mortality rates, or education (which are the flip sides of consumerism and Jerry Springer). We must engage the parts of the world that hate us, and let them see the things that make our country and our system great, so that they can understand that it is not just about McDonalds and Nike sweat shops and arrogant conservative Presidents.   "With great power comes great responsibility."
