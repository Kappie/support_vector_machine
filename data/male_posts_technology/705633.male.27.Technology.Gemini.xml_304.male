Thanks to Simon for looking after me in my state of inebriation. At least I wasn’t alone in that sentiment Friday night!!!  This Friday is rapidly approaching and I have THE BEST ever present for Toaster… I also have a brand new pair of trousers. Due to most of mine splitting in the crotch recently. I think I have upset someone recently who, instead of cutting my trousers, has gone through my wardrobe and unpicked the stitches around the one eyed python storage space.  They are due to be seen on the Great T’s Trip To Guernsey.
