Er what else. Um. Just had a wicked shower. Nice and waaaarm which was cool. Lol. Um, I miss Paul :( Lots of mayhem going on on msn atm. I should really go do some work. Gah. I am now working all day Sunday and probably some evenings after school next week. Most evenings actually. Which is good because of money and this time if I am knackered or whatever I'm just not going to moan because it annoys people so. Yea.  Good advice dudes: Listen to your heart. Yea.  Um seeing as no one is really blogging I'll post a subject thingy for now in case someone wants something specific to blog about:  The music problem in the common room
