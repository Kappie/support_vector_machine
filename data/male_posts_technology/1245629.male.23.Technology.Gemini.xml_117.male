There is a Bug Open  urlLink 18266    for this kind of behaviour and a patch supplied.  Not tried with the Patch yet. But hope that this feature/features  discussed in the bug becomes available with future Mozilla releases as  default.   Hey, its very much possible for a user to expect that new mails will  be checked in all folders and subfolders of IMAP and he should say so  explicitly.
