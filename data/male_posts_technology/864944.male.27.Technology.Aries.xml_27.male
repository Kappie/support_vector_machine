It was a very beautiful affair with a tea party theme.  Catering, a tent, teacups, flowers, a cake, and a string duet made it very classy indeed.   For my part, I was inside fixing a toilet, getting a tour of Paul and Linda's home to learn more about inspecting a house, and i was occasionally paraded outside to show my face for one embarassing game or another.   Good times :)  Seriously though, I would like to thank Paul and Linda (and Porcha!) for putting on a real nice shower, that I know chris, and my family all enjoyed.   And I also want to thank Paul for giving me a crash course in the internals of a house.     -----------------------------------  House Buying   Chris and I have come to the conclusion that we pay way too much rent, and its time to try to find a place to buy.   We have been looking in Arlington mostly, but we are also considering Medford, Watertown, and Belmont.   It is deffinitely an exciting process, and I am certainly learning alot about everything with my own finances, and with home buying in general.  Lots to learn.. and lots to do.   Also.. open houses are tons of fun :)   -------------------------------  Hillbilly Whack!   The whack is going VERY strong now.  We have completed Beta 1, and released a small batch of critical fixes to start Beta 2.   We have a definite game plan to get the other outstanding bugs fixed, and fill in the missing content.  Then we will be looking at fixes to gameplay problems.  Places that need some spice will get it.   We'll probably have one more small beta, then POW!  We'll release the game to fanfare, and Jay's amazing marketing skills.     Smallfry Studios is already seeing regular traffic comign in from  urlLink flashkit  and  urlLink gamasutra  which are both big industry sites.  Jay really is amazing with that stuff.      We also have plans to have a launch party when its time for the game to go live.  It should be a hoot. (we looked back at old work last night... wow we've come far).   -----------------------------  Poker   I have certainly gotten myself into small fads from time to time.  Heck, my entire video  gaming hobby is based on games that pass by in a week or two, but Poker seems like its here to stay.  I am now hosting a weekly Texas Holdem game that sports usually 10 and as many as 16 people!  Thats 2 tables!  Crazy.    We dont play with much money, but the plan is to learn the game well enough to head to foxwoods and try our hand at this very in depth game.  We are looking to play regular tables, as well as enter tournaments.  Foxwoods has tournaments that you can enter for as little as $35!  Here's to that noble goal :)  In the meantime, we are having lots of fun mastering the game, and learning its intricaces.     -----------------------------------  Video Games   The games you want to watch out for are the following:  Half Life 2 -- Jut delayed till Holiday 2003, but it has the most advanced physics engine I have ever seen.  THe original Half Life is possibly my facorite game, this one is sure to top it.  Horizons -- This one looks ot be out in the fall.  It is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game, and it has lots of features that make it seem like it will beat out the pack.  Since Star Wars Galaxies was such a let down, We are all very anxious to see this game and have a great time with it!   Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR) -- This is an role playing XBox game from the makers of Baldurs Gate, and NEverwinter Nights.  It is a truly wonderful game, and it is alot of fun in the star wars universe.   What makes me even happier is it is the first great game i have gotten from  urlLink Gamefly .    Gamefly is a service like netflixx.  You rent games (up to 2 at a time) for a flat fee per month.  You can however, keep those two games out for as long as you like.  This means I am not spending money on crappy games that I play for only a day.  If I hate the game, i send it back and get the next one in line.   They only do console games, but that is ok with me.  Its a neat program, though you do have to be a regular gamer for it to really make sense.      Thats all for now.  Hope everyone is doing well out there!
