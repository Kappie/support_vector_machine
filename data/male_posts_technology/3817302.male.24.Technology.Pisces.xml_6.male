He hasnt found the killer YET. Being by yourself on the streets of Kalisham is bad enough but its much worst when you are only 5.  Solomon soon started working with the local "unsavoreys" under a crooked merchant named Galimar. They found out he could get into places undetected because of his size that they couldnt. But soon he started to grow. By the time he was 17 he was already towering over people at 6'4". He soon learned the advantages of this, he started wearing a long black robe that covered his hands and face and learned to use his deep hollow voice with the look. Dark as it might be he liked people being scared of him when they first thought of the grim reaper when they saw him. Also since a very young age Solomon"felt" different, he has only recently gotten an idea that heis of dragon heritage and he yearns to unless that power.    He worked for Galimar and prospered, he was actually content in his work and life. Until one day when he was sent to accompany a gnome cleric to check on the progressof a job in the woods. Where as the orcs that were running the job attacked them. He quickly made way of them and freed the captives running the machine.They went back toGalimar to confront him where he had them attacked and put on a slave ship.His new companions and himself took the ship let the slaves loose and the gave them the ship. He has befriended his new companions. He finds the small ones humorous and likesthe druid but doesnt understand his love for the forrest when he could be in a city. Also lately a eastern monk and asnooty wizard have joined their ranks.He likes the monk greatly for he seems very trustworthy and will probably grow to be a great fighter, even without a weapon.Wizards are always useful so he doesnt mind having him around but their views are very different, so its alittle hard to see where he is coming from.  Until recentlyGalimar was Solomons only goal, but finally he got to finish business.He was thrilled when he finally sawGalimarcowering under adesk (what a perfect way for him to go) and cut in 2. he is still laughing inside. He doesnt know what to do now I guess he willpersue hisquest for power and riches and hopefully find the ful power ofthe dragon blood that runs through is veins.
