The second was more beautiful ! It was..... Suspense... A 4 hours Trial (motorbike) training period with a French champion. I had a French champion only for me :p Mouarffffff. So Friday afternoon we went to the trial school near Carcassonne (a French town) with my trial motorbike and I spend my 4 hour to Learn how to become a champion ;) I had eat a lot of speck of dust, climbing on very high rock, falling sometimes too :). Finally, I came back exhausted to home with a lot of good advice, and so many things to remember for my future competition. Thank you my darling for this marvelous gift.
