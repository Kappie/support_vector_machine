I just received this email on the NTSysAdmin mailing list:       The PSS Security team is issuing this alert to advise customers that on Saturday 9/13/03 a research company called XXXXXX published a paper providing guidance on how to exploit the vulnerabilities patched by Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-039.  To date we've had no reports of actual exploit code being publicly available or being used actively in a worm or virus     The paper makes it very simple to your 11 year old neighbor to write a worm with this exploit.      Patch your systems!!  Mine are all patched (as of today) so get busy.  Find out more about the  urlLink PSS Security Team .
