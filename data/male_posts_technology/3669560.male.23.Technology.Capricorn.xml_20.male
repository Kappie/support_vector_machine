The dipshit said this a while ago, but I just saw it again  urlLink here , headlining a very   anti-american   blog chronicling the dead from both sides of the war.    "The story of what we've done in the postwar period is remarkable. ... It is a better and more important story than  urlLink losing a couple of soldiers  every day."    Who said that? Representative  urlLink George Nethercutt  (R), the voice for my hometown in this nation's Legislature. Sickening.  That's not exactly the  urlLink whole context , and he surely didn't intend it to be that   pointed.   Regardless, I'm sure he meant what he said. This doesn't make him evil or a murderer, just blind to the fundamental flaws in the pro-war position.
