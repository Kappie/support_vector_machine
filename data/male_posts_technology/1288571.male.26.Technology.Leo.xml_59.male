My fiancee's parents moved there because her dad is in the Canadian military...some sort of promotion.  At any rate, how cool is that? They've offered to pay for her ticket as a christmas present, so I just have to get one for myself.  So far prices I've seen are around the $1500 (Canadian) range, so it's pretty steep and thats where the possibility comes in.. if I can afford it, I go. :)  Nevertheless, I'm excited to all hell at the good chance of heading over to Europe for a week or two!
