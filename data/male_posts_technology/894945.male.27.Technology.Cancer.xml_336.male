However, Toaster, Custard and myself went out last night to say goodbye to a good friend who is leaving Jersey today (please don't go). Thats right, my friend Franki, who I have only known for two days but am already great friends with, is leaving us here in Jersey to go back home to England, however we didn't let her go away without a good piss up first!     We were also accompanied by Danger and Princess Kate and we all went out to Chicago Rock Cafe for a boozer. Suffice to say that we went through most of the cocktail and shots lists that they had to offer! And we proceeded to get merrily drunk and then we all headed for Follies, and then Zebra Square, which happened to be closed!  So off we headed to ....... The Havana Club! Never before have I seen such cheesey dancing in town, however it ain't that bad, in some ways. After this everyone split for their separate destinations. All in all, a very cool night and a good way to say bye to a good mate. Pictures to follow once the camera gets developed.......  Baity signing off.....
