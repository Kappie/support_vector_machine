If only she had told me where they were stored before leaving for sunny Spain I wouldn't be in this mess. She could have at least told me how to use the washing machine, I tried it the other day, there's no remote for it and I can't find the mouse either, ill just have to wait till she gets back.  I think its a grand conspiracy, Girlfriends MAKE you rely on them for things like this, they make sure whenever possible you are left in the dark so when the time comes and they aren't there and you are looking forward to a fortnight of playing games, all you spend your time doing is worrying about where the next sock is coming from. Don't even get me started on The Underpant Situation. There are some advantages to this renewed semi-freedom I am experiencing though. Today in lieu of proper food (I once applied to be on both teams on that TV show "cant cook, won't cook") I went searching for fast food and chanced upon a chip shop not a hundred yards from my door! Also, I have had the time to create this website and dedicate some time to it (what do you mean that's not an advantage? What the hell do you know!).  Of course, I can't talk about my girlfriends absence without mentioning how much I miss her (sock cleaning expertise) and how much I wish she was here (to explain the washing machine thingy). Deep down, i am a romantic. But above all I am a malnutritioned soon to be sockless, washing machineless male with no idea where the spatula is and even less idea what to bloody do with it even if I had it.
