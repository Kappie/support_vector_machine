So, just click the "Archives" link on the left, and search the page for "Shrek".  The article in question is titled: "How "Shrek" went from being a train wreck to one for the record books".  If you're a fan of the Shrek series, you may find this "behind the scenes" tale very interesting.  If you are trivia buff, it's a  must  read. :)
