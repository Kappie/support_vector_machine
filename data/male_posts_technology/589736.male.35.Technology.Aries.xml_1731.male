There is a link below the news item (as of this posting it read "74 comments) -- several pages of discussion.  I use it mainly at work or connected to a stereo at home, so it's usually plugged into an outlet anyway.  So as a user I may not be comparable to the campus-roaming users who rely on the battery daily for months on end.
