The Dallas Morning News reported Wednesday that some of Bush’s Guard files may have been intentionally dumped ahead of his presidential run in 2000:   “Retired National Guard Lt. Col. Bill Burkett said Tuesday that in 1997, then-Gov. Bush’s chief of staff, Joe Albaugh, told the National Guard chief to get the Bush file and make certain ‘there’s not anything there that will embarrass the governor.’   “Col. Burkett said that a few days later at Camp Mabry in Austin, he saw Mr. Bush’s file and documents from it discarded in a trash can. He said he recognized the documents as retirement point summaries and pay forms.”
