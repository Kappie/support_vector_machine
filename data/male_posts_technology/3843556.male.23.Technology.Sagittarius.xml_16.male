But it is when  this vision is lost that an individual begins to lose grip of his or her life. All of us go in search of happiness and joy. According to Darwin "Survival of the Fittest" defines evolution. Well, I'm a firm believer that this theory is also well suited for our everyday lives. Hence there exists within us a driving force that guides us through each day. What is it in my case? A tricky question it is but I shall be as honest as I can be. I am an ambitious person. I am a dreamer with a lot of passion for whatever I do. Living in luxury in my dream castle with my princess, a porsche to ride in and experience all the worldly pleasures are not merely dreams. I have faith in me that I would realize these dreams. But then pause right there. To me life means more than the above materialistic pleasures. Undying love and happiness are of great importance to me. I am happy as long as I reach my goals. It does not cause me any anxiety to see someone do better than me. Take my word for it, I couldn't be happier for you. There have been many obstacles where I have stumbled but each one them has made me stronger for tommorow. Twenty years down the lane I want to be able to look back and say "Yes,I did make something out of my life". The above constitute the light that burns within me that guides me through each day of my life.
