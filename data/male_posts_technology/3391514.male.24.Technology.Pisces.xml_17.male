And I get there and find it has been cancelled, as half the players are missing.  So my afternoon was spent playing  UFO  (the original).  This evening was not much better... I did very little indeed.  However, in positive roleplaying news, I have revised an old  GURPS  campaign.  Back in my earlier RPG days, I ran what I now consider "probably the second worst game ever".  Second only to the travesty of Fighting Fantasy.  This game was known as TL10 Commando.  It was an excuse for the players to blast aliens with little sign of a plot.  It was hurried into production, and thus had no impact.  Although one of the players was originally going to play a robot that was essentially a walking mouth on legs.  A few years back I had some ideas of revising it but they didn't get very far.  And then, on Friday morning, I had many ideas.  Some have been scribbled down, and they might even make it to Word this time!  Not that I expect anyone will want to play it of course...   Frasier  ends this week... leaving me with very little to watch on TV.  I only have DVD's to keep me from going insane.
