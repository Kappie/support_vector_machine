Fourteen gazillion job sites and they all have the same six jobs that I'm either: A) unqualified for, B)Over qualified for C)Not the least interested in.  I seem to have this problem where I know what kind of career I DON'T want more than I know what I DO want.  Oh well...the shizzle falls where it's pooped, I guess.  I guess I oughtta get my ass ready for my lame McJob now, so I can make my 10.50 an hour by being treated like scum by junkies and skids.  Yay for downtown Vancouver!    Damn I'm negative today...sheesh... Snap outta it.
