They are a damned phone company after all, but Cingular is buying them, so all I have to say is that I am proud that a business can swoop in when a new craze is started (cell phones) and become so large.  They plan to add wireless hi-speed internet, too.  I know, I should link to things.  I will starting next time, I promise.
