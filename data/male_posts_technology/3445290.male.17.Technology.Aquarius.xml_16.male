I was feeling down for a long time just knocking on these doors and putting on a act of enthusiasm and a rubber smile because there were some problems in other parts of my life too but as soon as I reached this one house I started talking to the family and they let me in their house and offered me dinner and really wanted to show me some of their wood works they had made and thought nothing of getting a trial of the Vancouver Sun Newspaper which played a big part in my total change in attitude this week because a small group of people made my day by being nice to me and socializing in a friendly manner with me for just 10 minutes which made all the difference. After that house for some reason everyone was suddenly nice when I had this positive attitude on me and I was able to get 3 sign-ups within a 30 minute time span which is really awesome since I get 10$ per sign-up in commission.     I also ran into a tarot card reader who did not want the paper since she already had it but when I walked away she mentioned what the rune stone that I wear on my neck 24/7 was called "Rune Beoric" and meant "The birch was a tree of inception" which supposedly means that others around me may be affected by negativity but my necklace protects me from any negative energy and always indicates a physical birth either of a child or of an idea which means I am reborn as a person when I free myself from any negativity I may already have and is one of four cycle runes, it signifies growth in relationships, families, fertility and fruition. Like i said in other posts i really dont believe in anything spiritual but I have noticed that since i got this necklace from thailand I have been closer to my dads side of the family and I really never feel stressed about much anymore. The tarot card reader also mentioned that she just studied that in the morning so I was finding a lot of coincidences going on that day.       **Anyways, the moral of this post is to treat all people, even the dreaded sales person with some respect and kindness because it really does make all the difference in their lives when they are just having a hard time in their life's. Its 9:15am so I'm gunna eat and go for a quick workout so see U l8r!**
