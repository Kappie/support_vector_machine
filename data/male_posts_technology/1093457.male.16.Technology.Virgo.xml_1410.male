It's life, it sucks but it happens. You just got to be careful about who your closer friends are.  and why is it that their mums always need you to go and fix their computers?  no idea!  and finally what do you say to someone who has been given a month to live? You don't say anything. Sometimes they live a lot longer than that one month. You spend teh next month giving them good memories, taking them places or just being all that you can be for them. You just gotta try and make them happy so they don't regret their last month or so. Hope its all ok :) Btw Dave when is your bday?  Sorry this is short would write more about my amazing day at Woolies but must dash off to Gatwick. See you all soon!
