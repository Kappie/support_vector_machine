So to make up for it here is the homepage of an emulator called  urlLink Hob  that has 19 games playable on the site with a fair degree of overlap with my list yesterday. But what if you wanted to play one of the games that was on the list yesterday but not on Hob's? Well then you go to the site of  urlLink JX Speccy  which has 5,500 (count 'em) games online. They even have  urlLink Moon Cresta  for ILuvNufc. I think that should make up for it. Sorry!
