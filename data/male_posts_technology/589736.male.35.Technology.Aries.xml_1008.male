You should know them already.  1)  FALSE.  2) FALSE.  3) FALSE  As for the oil argument, I can think of three much easier targets militarily and one domestically than spending billions of dollars invading a relatively well defended country.  Let's see, there is (in order of hardest to easiest) 3) Venezuela - Right in the middle of extreme labor unrest, very close to the US.  Would not require as much in the way of a logistics train.  (As a side note, Venezuela is the main reason we have had the price spikes in gas.  They are still only operating at 20% of their normal petroleum output).  2)  Saudi Arabia - We already have more troops in Saudi than they do and we have 250,000 in Kuwait.  It would take like 2 days to "conquer" them.  And the easiest is 1)Kuwait - Our military is already there.  We could just claim victory and take hold of some of the richest oil fileds in the world.  Of course, the domestic option is drilling in ANWAR, but we know that won't happen.
