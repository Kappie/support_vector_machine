Well, my future to be exact. I think about the dance floors all around the world. I think about all the young boys dancing, tripping to the dense beat of music. I think about the DJ’s and imagine them looking out onto the floor as they spin the music. All the kids moving in slow motion, the lights streaming back and forth across their faces. Faces lost in another world, eyes closed imagining the music… seeing it.  They can see it you know. I could see it when I danced. When that perfect song came on, I’d close my eyes, and I’d be there, with the music around me. I’d push harder and harder, I’d feel it, see it, and move to it. I was in love with the music. Drum  Bass, Trance, House, Jungle… I felt it all.  It pumped through my body like waves across the sand. I felt alive, I felt more real than I had ever before. I’d open my eyes and look around at all the beautiful people. What were they thinking? Did they feel the music like me? Yes they did.  I could see it in their face.   They were lost in the same land I was. I always went to a place that seemed religious. People on pedestals dancing to the music I heard. I could see myself walking through arch ways, and down, great halls. I’d finally reach a huge enclosed courtyard. There, I’d find all the people on the dance floor, moving, pumping, all in their own light. Beautiful light surrounded us, flashing, glowing, and dancing to the beat just like us. It seemed like a temple. And you knew they did this all the time, you’d come to dance, and leave to sleep. When you woke up, you’d just dance again. Every once in a while we’d take breaks, to talk to friends, gossip a bit, and discuss the song we liked most. Then back to the floor. Slowly the music would come back on, just like a hymn during church. They’d gather together on the floor, slowly coming back to life, waiting for the beat to break in. Then pounding the floor again, to make a commotion, to press them into another world. You can do that if you dance hard enough. You leave this world and go away on some trip floating along, with images and sound as your guide. It’s the most beautiful place I’ve ever been to. I’ll never stop dancing.
