In my opinion, music these days is a vast wasteland of crap. Maybe it's my old age, but back in the day when I was but a boy, music in the 80's was music. Heck even the crappy stuff sounded catchy. I just don't get the music kids listen to today. Especially rap. Someone needs to explain to me the "genius" of Eminem. All I see is a white trash punk who beats up his wife and talks crap about his mom. Musical genius? Please. In any case, being a progressive rock fan is like being a dinosaur. Prog rock seems to become marginalized more and more as time passes. It won't be long when the more mainstream prog bands will literally die off. How much longer is Yes going to be around? You get the feeling that the end is near for a band like Rush. Marillion, another of my favorite bands, is less of a prog band and more of...I'm not sure what they are. They've gone off in different directions musically that it's hard to categorize what they are really. Their latest release, Marbles, does give me hope though.  Anyhow, back to IQ. I was introduced to IQ's music by my friend back in 1994 when they toured for Ever. I had no familiarity with ANY of their music other than Ever and the show we went to was a near religious experience for me. Needless to say, I went out and bought the rest of their CDs. For the most part every IQ release has been a masterpiece. The exceptions being the period of two albums when their original lead singer, Peter Nicholls, left the band in the late 80's and was replaced by Paul Menel. For two albums, the band morphed into a bizarre 80's pop band singing happy songs. It's akin to Genesis when Peter Gabriel left and was replaced by Phil Collins, only worse. Exit experimental progressive rock band, enter cheesy pop band.  So, the latest IQ CD is out and I got myself a copy. After listening to it, my impression is...meh. In my opinion, the zenith of their musical mastery was Subterranea, an epic two CD set that had so much complexity and richness, every time I listen to it I discover something new. It's THAT good. Subterranea came out in 1998. Since then, they've done some re-recordings of old stuff, some live CDs, and two new studio albums: The Seventh House, and the new one, Dark Matter. Seventh House was good. A little short but still brilliant in its own way. Sadly, Dark Matter is a different...matter altogether. First of all, it's short. For a band that regularly composes epic songs in excess of 10 minutes, a 53 minute CD is shocking. But even more shocking is the fact that the songs are boring. Sure you have an 11 minute song to start it off and an 24 minute song to end it, but overall it's the most nondescript effort IQ has ever done. There is a distinct lack of complexity in their musical arrangement and a total lack of complex harmonies. Things that IQ normally excel at. They start building on some good stuff and then cut it short. The centerpiece of the CD, a 24 minute epic song, was, for the first time that I can remember, actually boring. The soaring, dramatic instrumental segments which I love are missing and the ones that are there just don't grab me the way that they usually do.  I write this as a first impression after giving Dark Matter a good listen. Quite frankly, I'm beyond shocked. To me IQ has always been the type of band where I know that I'm going to get excellent quality, memorable songs. For the first time, they let me down. Maybe I need to listen to it some more to see if it will grow on me. I really hope it grabs me the more I listen to it, but I have a feeling that it will not. For the first time, I'm wondering if this is a hint of things to come. Is IQ washed up? Are they losing "it"? Or is this just a once in a lifetime strikeout? It's enough to make me pause and think about whether or not one of the last bastions of good progressive rock is about to go the way of the dinosaur.
