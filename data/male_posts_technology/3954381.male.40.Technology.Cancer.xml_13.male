Aside from the surplus of food that, in the past, I would consume; my activities are usually filled with getting stoned, watching holiday themed movies and classic specials and generally enjoying the abundant quantity of media related gifts my best buddy Babalu bestows upon me. He really is a great cat.  Shopping online accounts for approximately 95% of the gifts I give to others; I really like to be prepared and pick out what I think is the perfect for the loved ones on my list. Usually by October I have a fairly solid list of people to shop for and a list of items I am thinking of buying. Then I start to do searches, looking for the best deals online; i.e. free shipping, prices, discounts, etc. After placing the order I record the order information in the spreadsheet and save any relevant emails I receive such as order confirmations and shipping notices. This is truly one area my anal retentiveness pays off. As each order is received I cross reference it on the spreadsheet marking it "received"; and store the packages in one closet to be wrapped at a date closer to December 25th.  I consult my Outlook calendar and pick an opportune weekend about 10 days before Christmas and plan my holiday baking. In addition to the typical store bought gifts for the people on my list, I like to provide them with a ample supply of home baked treats. The list of recipients is typically about 20 people long, plus I like to bring in a platter of cookies to work a couple days before Christmas so the baking is pretty extensive. My cookie list is usually typed and checked (and re-checked) at least by the middle of November. At that time I estimate how many batches of each type of cookie I plan to bake, since my list of recipients is fairly lengthy and as I stated I like to provide ample amounts. I make a mean cookie. All butter, high quality chocolates and fruits and nuts....I may have issues of low self esteem, but I am quite confidant when it comes to my talents in the kitchen. I make your standard issue chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, peanut butter, biscotti, rugelach and at least one or two varieties of shortbread. On top of those I have a fairly lengthy list of recipes I've collected off of various sites for more exotic fair. All in all I make about 14-15 different varieties of cookies and they are all, at the minimum, double batches. I don't get into decorating them, they don't look like traditional Christmas cookies but they taste abso-fucking-lutely awesome and when a couple of each type are combined in a holiday box or tin...well it just screams "I love you!!!!" (as well as "Hi, I'm Frank and I'm an over-achiever!")  In addition to the cookies, last year and in 2001 I made up about 75-80 holiday audio CD's. In 2001 I did a double CD set of holiday music. I give them out to everyone at work, even the people I didn't like (ok, MOST of them I really don't like). I decided, rather late last year (well late for me, it wasn't Thanksgiving yet but I hadn't ordered the jewel cases, the blank CDR's, labels and CD covers) to do a new version of my famous CD. I partially blame Mariah Carey. Her version of "All I Want for Christmas" that was featured in the movie  Love, Actually  inspired me to release a new CD. I also creatively turn the CD into a Christmas card, hand signing each CD on the inside jacket. It sounds like an enormous amount of work, and it is, but since I am perpetually single.....well I have a lot of free time on my hands. I take about a week or two deciding on what songs should be on the CD, illegally downloading them off of Napster (in 2001) and Kazaa (last year); listen to them for quality control, burn the CD's, print the labels and audio covers and spend a coulpe hours in the living room watching some holiday movies while I apply the label and set all 80 copies up. Some get mailed, most are hand delivered about a week before Christmas to all my co-workers. I like seeing the look of genuine surprise on their faces when I give them out, which sometimes turns to delight when they realize what it is and scan the list of tracks. I have a pretty eclectic taste in music but you really can't go wrong in selecting Christmas music....everything goes together nicely whether the tracks are from contemporary artists or artists long dead. I decided last year that that would be the last CD. I think I have covered every song, and certainly what I feel is the best version so unless someone comes out with another instant classic, there's nothing I can do to expand on the concept.  I do a lot at Christmas....I like to. It keeps me busy, I think it's fun, I can spread some joy and happiness; which is something I rarely do and it all leads up to my taking about two weeks off for me to lay around the house in a marijuana induced stupor, in between looking online to have my own stocking stuffed. Good times.  I've already started my shopping but I am having trepidation on my baking ritual this year. Dare I spend a weekend in the kitchen baking until I want to cry feeling the stress and then having the temptation of having all these baked goods in the house. Even when I give them away I keep an unholy and unhealthy supply on hand for myself. I thought about canning salsas this year, or applesauce....something from my kitchen; but I am undecided. Obviously I have plenty of time, but I like to have a plan as well as a plan of attack. Maybe I will do my baking but scale back the assortment as well as the quantity. I don't think I can, in good conscious, give out my treats knowing they are fat laden morsels of heaven. I am pretty confidant I can limit myself in my consumption but the excuse of the "holidays" doesn't justify their potential lethal potency.  Another area I think I need to scale back is going to be what I allow Babalu to buy for me. I am giving him a spending limit of $200 on me and he better not go over that limit. I've been hinting on the Sondheim DVD collection but his attention span is pretty lacking.  I know I am a little early yet, but have a really Merry Christmas and Happy Healthy and Prosperous New Year!  Love Frank and Babalu
