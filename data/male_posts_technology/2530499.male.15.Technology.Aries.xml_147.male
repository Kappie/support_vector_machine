The whole pre-printed label thing is for the CD's and other random things that Kelly gets. Anyways, Blake came over and helped me clean, so we can go camping this Thursday. My dad seems a little worried about the whole thing, and I can't blame him. We're two teenage boys going five miles away for 24 hours...Anyways, I have plans to eat dinner and go swimming and  even  update my blog via my laptop and TMo. (That's T-Mobile to you non-SE's. [That's Social Engineer for you non-KM fans. {That's Kevin Mitnick for you non-hacker fans.}]) Anyways, I'll let everyone know how things are goin' in general. Bye now.  [Music:] The fan, blowing.   Current Clipboard Contents: We note that the current AOL CDs being distributed give you up to 1045 hours of free use within 45 days. There are 1080 hours available during that time period. We have not determined what is wrong with the other 35 hours that they can't simply offer unlimited service for 45 days. Perhaps some of that time is used to dial in and connect. It is hoped that you will be able to eat, sleep, and possibly work during the time you are evaluating AOL.
