Guys like the   urlLink one here  are aplenty who could not get their hands on installing Lomboz on Eclipse 3 properly. I appreciate  urlLink John Danforth  for writing a very detailed and comprehensive guide for installing Lomboz and Eclipse (both 3.0), alas, even that doesnt work too. So whats the way out?  Some discussion points  urlLink here  could be of some use. Remeber your life is full of trials and errors when it comes to installing Lomboz on Eclipse.  I request some of you who have already and successfully installed this, please come forward and share your ideas along with links (if any) so that people like me could make use of this latest avatar of Eclipse and Lomboz.
