McLachlan Street is going smoothly, for me at least...Kaia is about to have an action launched against her by the  urlLink lesbians  across the road, this story I will tell....  After returning to a NON SARS inflicted life I ventured out into the world of partyness alalesbian...The Story goes:  Catherineneaieneee' (The  urlLink French  Lesbian) invited me to a party she was having at a Lush  urlLink New York  Styled Studio Apartment on the Corner of Swanston St and Flinders Lane (Smashing). BYO Champagne the invitation read, F$#$^#$%k, they had 30 something cases of  urlLink Domain Chandon , didnt I look the fool. Thankgoodness I had decided against the  urlLink Spumante , but I probably could have done better than the Cockatoo Ridge as well....  The party was, well, very  urlLink Moulin Rouge  meets  urlLink My Life As a Dyke Two  meets  urlLink The Peel  (Remember that Gede!?!?!), needless to say I was enjoying myself thoroughly. A little into the preceedings I noticed that all the other lesbians from across the road and their partners were ignoring me. So grabbing another bottle from the fridge I ventured to the land of lesbian corner to find out their qualms.   Having had more than my fair share to drink, I decided that I would confront this issue face on (I dont shave my airpits, they dont shave theirs, we should be friends, whats the fuss!?). So here I was, and here they were, and even though I was very warm in an Australian made Wool Suit Jacket, the room was seemingly cold. So here I was, and here they were, "Wasup" was my opening piece (trying to sound as if I'd just arrived on my 9000cc 1965 Honda Kawasaki Motordike or was that motorbike, after the attempts to kick start my truck turned useless), still coldness. So here I was, and here they were, "So is there a problem grrls" I asked...The swiss one spoke up at last, "Yes, Catherineneaieneee said thaet youu werre an investamenta banka forr a multttinationalist capatistist consumer organsiationnss"; Gee, Okay then, I see how they could have got this impression, so I quickley pointed out that they had me confused with my housemate Kaia, and pointed out that I was a student activist, and that they may not have seen me around much 'cos I'd been really busy organising refugees being freed, and Iraq being a no war zone, and free education. Ahhhh, Best Friends Again....I did fail to mention that Gede had just flown to the other side of the world business class and was staying at Edinburgh Castle, but Im sure I will see them around.  Anyway that is just my little update...Hope you enjoyed it...Carrie, Kaia and I are off to a film tomorrow nite, and I think the weekend hold plans to get really pissed, not that we drink.  Good for now. James.  *NB: Not all websites have been checked for anything inparticular, so be cautious when opening.
