Today....Lord Vador (my father) celebrates 53 years of touching lives...And by touching I really mean bending, tearing, shredding, changing, shitting on, molding into, neglecting, taking for granted and otherwise ruining!  (i know i know...me n my therapist are working on it)  Usually, if he sends me a gift at all, he sends me some manner of religious material...you know...since i'm not into it at all....well...one good turn deserves another......I'm gonna send him a 1/4 of weed...    Happy birthday daddy!
