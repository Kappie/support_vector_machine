The trio comprising Mani, A.R.Rahman and Vairamuthu has been success from Roja. I bought the CD of Aayatha Ezuthu with a roughtough fight on March 15, the release date. The cost of the CD is Rs.125/- released by Sony Music. Mind you the CD is  copyprotected. Don't try to Pirate the cD. Lets get into Business    1.Hai Goodbye Nanba  By  Sunitha Sarathy, Shankar Mahadevan, A.R.Rahman, Karthik  All of us know about Silmisam. What is Kalmisam? if Anybody know the meaning plz explain me. This song has a touch of youthfulness with a low pitch female Voice and staggering high pitch male voice. This song distinguishes the difference friendship and love. Siddarth and Trisha will choreograph for this song.    2.Janaganamana   By  A.R.Rahman, Karthik  This songs rises the youthfulness in today's yuvas. I thought Rahman might have replicated Vande Mataram. But he did not. This song emphasises the youth capabilities, their strengths their ability to chop down the social and political bottlenecks. (Vairamuthu may get national award for this song)    3.Sandai Kozhi   by  Madhusree, A.R.Rahman  In Tamil poetry there is a term called "Oodal". Themed in folk, this song well explains the love feelings of soulmates after pink ponk fights.     4.Dol Dol   By  Blazee, Shaheen AKthar  This is the theme song of the film. The English verse of Blazee and Electrical Percussion of Shaheen Akthar is good. But this song is as good as "Yennendurum Punnai" from Alaipayuthey.    5.Nenjam ellam Kathal   By  Adnan Sami, Sujatha   Adnan Sami tamil fame started with Shankar's Boys and now he sung for ManiRatnam. This song focusses on the difference between love and love's destination. Vairamuthu clearly explains the destiny of love.    6.Yakkai Thiri   By  A.R.Rahman, Shalini Singh  This is a typical "Marapu Kavithai" song. It can't still find the answer what does this song mean?!  I will award 8 out of 10 for this film's music.
