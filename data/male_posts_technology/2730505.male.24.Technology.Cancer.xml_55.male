As I walked outside in the clean spring-ish air I felt the need to light one up and breath in smoke.  I then got inside the car and the craving subsided but came right back as I started to drive back to my house.  Was so tempted to go stop by the gas station and buy a pack but decided to stick with the plan.  I got home and called my sweetie.  She was doing homework, didn't talk much.  Still felt the need to smoke.  Going to bed soon.  Hopefully this craving will not keep me from sleeping.  It is now 12:01 March 3, 2004
