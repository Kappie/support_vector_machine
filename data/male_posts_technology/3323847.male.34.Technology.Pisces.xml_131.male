Say your local telephone company modified their service in such a way that if you call a number that'd usually ring busy would instead play you an advertisement for their services.  Not a bad idea to make use of an otherwise wasted phone call, but fundamentally changes the way the service works, potentially causing confusion not to mention the inability to tell if a phone is busy or not.  It's not a perfect analogy, but I think it gives you the gist of the topic of debate here.
