All I know right now is that I can try to share a thought I have with a person, and there is a good chance that they will misunderstand me, and they will take offense at whatever they think I said, and I will try to explain myself and end up digging my hole even deeper.  And of course, the harder I try to get out, the deeper I get in.  My thoughts make sense in my head.  Why don't they make sense in my mouth?  I pride myself on my intelligence and I end up looking more stupid each and every day.
