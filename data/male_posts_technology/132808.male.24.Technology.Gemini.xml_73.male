Okay, so Showcase Diva is only because I happen to catch it every time they're showing Degrassi High, but Tech TV?  I've never seen so many women who were both supremely dorky and frustratingly hot at the same time.  That Morgan from X-Play?  Man, that's the stangest combination of dorky and hot since I bought that Upper Deck Scottie Pippen/Jenna Von Oy card for two bucks from Cancentral.  Okay, if I didn't need a reminder as to why the NBA, which was once my supreme favorite sport, has fallen behind the NFL, CFL, NHL, WWE, CIS, IIHF, and MHSAA in terms of spectator sports, I've gotten a stark fucking reminder over the last three days.  As far as I know, and as far as I've heard, and read, and been told by Bill Walton himself, you need AT LEAST 0.7 seconds to be able to catch and shoot.  You also need at least 0.3 seconds just to tip the ball in.  But apparantly, if you're the LA Lakers, you can have 0.4 seconds to catch and shoot to win the game.  Fine, I'll live with that, if that's the worst that it can get...  But then watching game six, I left in disgust after two and a half quarters.  It's bad enough that Kobe Bryant travels EVERY fucking time he penetrates.  It's bad enough that if Karl Malone whines, he gets a technical, but if he whines EVEN MORE, the ref will change it to a double technical with Malone and Tim Duncan.  It's bad enough that if Shaq assaults you it's a no call but if you get within three feet of Kobe it's a reach-in.  And it's bad enough that Kobe, Phil Jackson and Shaq have the power to convince a referee to flip-flop on his calls.  But when DEVEAN FUCKING GEORGE CAN GET A REF TO CHANGE HIS CALL, that's when it's time to call it quits.  I was afraid that if I kept watching, Slava Medvedenko might ass-rape Hedo Turkoglu, only to have it be a foul on Turkoglu.  He is from Turkey, after all.  I'm quickly becoming totally obsessed with my fish tank.  I already want to increase my filtration and water movement levels by buying a Powerhead 402 and an Optima Air Pump.  Yeah, this is my computer talk now!!  Take your geek talk and your Wil Wheaton and your tech jokes (There are only 10 kinds of people in the world - those who understand binary and those who don't) and shove it!!  BOOYAH!
