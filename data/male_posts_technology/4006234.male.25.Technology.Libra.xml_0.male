What an excellent way to spend a hot Saturday afternoon.   Based on the traffic, I wasn’t the only one who wanted to get out of the city. I left at around 3:30 – 4:00 pm, headed out to Bragg Creek, and on to Elbow Falls. It took me about 45 minutes to get out there because of the traffic.   After an hour of lazing around at the falls, I got back on my bike and headed back to Bragg Creek. On the way back to Bragg Creek, I stopped off at "Elbow River Launch Point" and took some more photos (mostly of my bike ;-) ). 30 minutes later I was back on the road.   After the Launch Point, I headed on to Bragg Creek. Stopped there and filled up with gas. Busy Gas Station!I had a thought after I was back on the road; if there wasn’t a gas station there I would have been in trouble! I would have been lucky to make it back to Calgary on fumes. Well… Actually, I would have had my reserve.   Since I wasn’t in a hurry to get home I stopped again for another photo.   "Hey.... Cochrane is only 22k away?!?!"   Sweet… I’m heading off to Cochrane. 22km later I was pulling into Cochrane. While traveling through Cochrane I was tempted to stop for Ice Cream (great little  urlLink ice cream spot  there), but it was getting to be around 6ish and I didn’t know what time they were open till, so I kept going. 30km later I was back in Calgary.   I did learn a couple of things on this trip:   1) I need a bigger bike if I want to do longer road trips.  2) The “biker wave” is a standard greeting on the highway wishing you safe travel.  3) 3½ hours of travel, on a motorcycle, will make you SORE! I could barely move Sunday!  4) Take a lot of fluids along. I drank 2 liters of Gatorade on the trip.   Now I will have to say, that was a fun trip!    urlLink
