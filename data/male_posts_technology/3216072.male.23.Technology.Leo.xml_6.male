Let me tell you it was very fulfilling to know that I brought frustration into the hearts of so many of my fellow commuters. Yes there are people right now still cursing my name out there just sitting and waiting to get home.  I don't know what came over me really but it was great. At first people would just fly by me at twice my speed and blow their annoying ass horns. Then one guy who got trapped behind me got as close to my ass as he could and stayed there for too long blowing him self...I mean his horn. Then he proceeded to pull up next to me and it looked like he was trying to cuss me out. As for me, I just smiled back and gave him a pleasant wave with my middle finger. Thinking all the while "What a bitch!".  What happened next made this brilliant idea of mine all the more worth it. The infamous Chinese lady we all know and hate, going around 60 decided to get behind me and did not know what to do. So then in a sudden move she tries to swerve over and BAM! I see her car go flying end over end. The look on her face should have been the next Master Card commercial... Priceless!  So I figured with the days accomplishment under my belt I had better go ahead and join my fellow motorists at a normal 80 miles an hour and call it a day. When I got home I decided to enjoy my handy work by turning on the news. Sure enough there was a special report on about the highway that had to be shut down. And wouldn't you know the President was in town to add to the confusion.  Yes, when it has to be done, do it right. I have to say the joy it brought me and the closer I had was intense. I was finally able to get back at all the little Chinese women that decided to cut me off in traffic and do 20 under the speed limit. Score one for the coalition.
