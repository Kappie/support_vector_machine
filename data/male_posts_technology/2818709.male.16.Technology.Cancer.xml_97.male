I.E. - x-treme jello, Corn Nuts: Corn gone BAD!, X-treme energy, Whoop-Ass energy drinks: For that extra boost of energy!, Sour Skittles - You'll pucker until you implode!!!. Ok...Why?!?! Yeah, we want to buy those bad-ass products. It makes us all feel special.  Sam - "look, bob, check out this -----, i'm a badass now!" Bob - "Duuuuuude. Sweeeeeet. I wanna tap that!" Sam - "fuck no." Bob - "I'll arm wrestle ya for it." Sam - "Hell no, cracka, i'll play ya a game of russian roulette for it." Bob - "Bitch, ya gonna be pissin leed!"  See how quickly that conversation deteriorated? That's what bad-ass marketing is doing to the poor, poor, easily influenced minds of the people of today. It needs to stop. Now. All of it. Why bother? To get the pre-pubescent teen boys in on it? I sincerely doubt that they are concerned with corn nuts. Or energy bars. Dumbasses.
