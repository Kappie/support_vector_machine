The Coronas Major came in a nice aluminum screw-top tube. While stylish, retaining humidification is not its strong suit. If you buy one from a place with no reliable humidor, stick it in one for 2-3 days.  I had mine in a Zip-Lock back with some Spanish cedar shavings and a Drymistat. Not an attractive layout, but hey, I'm just getting started in this.  For someone new to cigar smoking or who doesn't want to get a buzz, try a hydrated Don Diego. I bought this one at an HEB (central Texas grocery chain) in Georgetown. I have a feeling their "humidor" is keeping things a dripping 45-55% RH. I squeezed the DD right after buying it and the cap began to crack. 4 days in the bag with the Drymistat had it all recharged.  The smoke was still gnarly as all good cigars are but relatively mild. The taste was very subtle until I had about an inch to inch-and-a-half to go. Then the cigar got quite mushy, the draw was getting too hot and I was having a devil of a time keeping it lit. Up to that point it was quite nice. I'd smoke it again, or perhaps something like it in the less-expensive range.
