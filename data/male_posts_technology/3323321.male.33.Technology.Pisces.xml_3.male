I didn't cause this by my finger, because I did the finger repair work on the road, we were just on Franklin time. I had a great time, although not a lot of Pinball but I got to hang out with some old friends whose company I actually enjoy, and got to meet a new friend who was pretty funny for how young he was (maybe I'm just jealous of being young again). We stopped at MURDER BURGER (not REDRUM Burger as all you lame ass Davis liberal Nazis know it as), the food was good but gave identically smelling gas to two of our group who seemed to feel as though there was extreme humor in it...
