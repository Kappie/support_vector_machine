What is the first thing you buy for someone else?   Probably a holiday for all my mates  4. Do you give any away?  Yea, but not straight away, I'd get some interest and then give some of the interest away  5. Do you invest any? If so, how?   yes... I'd gt some stocks and put some away in a high interest bank so that I get lots of extra money.
