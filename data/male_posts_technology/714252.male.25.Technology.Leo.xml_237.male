There's so much to say yet so much I can't say anymore.. My Blog has slowly evolved from somewhere I could write whatever I want to somewhere that I have to watch what I say more than I do in real life..  It's strange how much intonation and facial expresion adds to a conversation.. I say fuck you on a blog and ten people will hear it ten different ways.. I say it with a smile and Bubbles in a head lock and everyone knows I'm telling him how much I hate that son of a Bitch.  I have re-written this paragraph (yes the one you are reading now) 5 times. I've realised there is just no way to write what I want to write so I have to leave it.. That leaves me feeling (I've now been sat here for the last 5 minutes trying to figure out the next word.. What a blog this is..) cheated? That isn't the right word but it is the best one I can find right now..  Hmmmm.. What a depressing blog this is turning out to be and again that's just because it is text with no feeling or emoting to give it the right context.. It's not like a book because I can hardly write in a third person style (or maybe I could..)  "Michael sat down to write his blog. As he opened notepad thoughts of what to write flowed through his mind, random memories of his last couple of days.  Would he write about work or play? He is in a good mood, work is going well and his love life (though complex at best) gives him a smile he can't resist beaming to the world at every oportunity. As he starts to type a thread starts to form in his mind. Whenever Michael blogs it's always the same.. He starts out with a sentance and occasionaly a rough map of where he wants his blog to end up but never lets anything reach a solid state till it is coming from his mind straight to the keyboard.. This has gotten him into trouble on more than one occasion, and it is this that he decides to use as his 'subject matter'.  He smiles to himself as he types away warming to his subject matter when suddenly he hits a stumbling block. How does he talk about his newfound tendency to censor his own blogs without getting into the shadier subject of exactly what he is leaving out..."  Hmm.. Again I hit a stumbling block.. How to phrase what comes next?  I guess the answer is I can't.. Not yet anyway.. So what do I do?  "Michael smiles to himself in a genuinely good mood as he realises that it doesn't really matter what he writes. The familiar damned if you do, damned if you don't feeling that he has come to welcome as the spice that keeps his life interesting settles on him as he realises that he has already writen enough to get himself in trouble  for a few more days without actually having said a thing..."
