Anyhow we are going what ever the whether is like, but depending on how cold it is we will wear more or less layers of clothes and if it is raining we wont go on the really wet rides like Tidal Wave. I am really excited now except for the prospect of getting up at 7:00Am tmor ! I am going to be wiped out by the end of the day ! anyway ill be off now i may as well start getting my stuff ready, that way i will have more time to do stuff in the morning ! HeHe see ya all tmor ! (except Jo)
