They refuse to be led, yet they refuse to lead. They ignore your most obvious attempts to keep them in some sort of known time signature. And what pray is this strange idea the pianist has that everybody should start singing at the beginning of the piece. Why isn't it a known fact that you start a few beats later, so that "Lord we lift your name on high" becomes "lift your name on high".  And isn't it just downright rude of the pianist to go onto the next bit when the congregation is so enjoying that soaring high note.    What It Comes Down To  I teach music. Mainly to children between the ages of 5 and 13. And kids being kids, you can often get into conversations about other things with them. And I just love this. Sometimes it's about holidays, other times about God and so on.   Anyway, recently, I was teaching a girl of about 9. She was looking tired when she arrived at the lesson. She told me she had moved in with her Dad. Previous to this, she had been living with her grandmother. Previous to that she had lived with her Dad, and again before that her mother. I asked her about this, and I found out that she doesn't know where her mother is. Her dad had let her stay up all night the night before playing video games and watching tv. She's a lovely girl, but I have had difficulty helping her in her music. She hasn't progressed as far as I would have liked. She has never seen commitment in her life, and therefore cannot give it to her music. her family structure is negatively effecting her education.   Now this case study is one that I could repeat over and over again to you. Different kids, and different scenarios, but with the same problem at the heart. With the breakdown of the family there is a breakdown in many other things.   You see, poor education, crime, poverty...our negative statistics.... these are linked to breakdown of the family, which is the defiance of one of God's first ordinances.
