The problem is that I don't know what to write, and whenever people choose to speak up, but don't have a particular point in mind, much less a particular way to make it... Well, they ramble, and thats when you change the channel.  So, I better come up with a point quickly!  How about this: Trials will come.  Overcoming them is better than never having faced them.  I am reminded of a time (maybe before I was born) shortly after my parents were married.  My parents were pretty poor.  And, I don't just mean college-student-poor.  I mean depending-on-God-for-everything-poor.  One day they returned home to find they had been robbed.  Most notably missing was my dad's Selmer Saxaphone.  ---Not something that they could afford to replace.  Flash forward to today, more than 25 years later.  My parents watch me cross the stage to receive my diploma for my MS...  (I can hear my dad saying, ``Saxaphone?  What saxaphone!?  I don't remember a saxaphone.'')  What's the connection?  For my dad, a gifted musician, his sax was a source of pride and joy.  And that was taken from him, years ago.  And now, he finds in his children an entirely different source of pride and joy.  Something that cannot be taken away, nor given a price.  Well...  I did end up telling a good story.  But, I didn't go the distance in making my point.  But, that is what happens when you are rambling at 3 AM.  I'll have to finish my point some other time.  But, you might be wise to keep it in mind in the mean time.  Thanks to all of you who came to see me graduate!  And thanks to those of you who congratulate me and celebrate with me!  I am very grateful!  And, I am very sleepy!  Good night, dear blogfan.
