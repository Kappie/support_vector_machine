Yesterday Martin and I did a couple of open water swims and a short ride along Monterey's  urlLink 17 mile drive . Our first swim was spent focused on learning the kelp crawl.    I think my weekly numbers look good.  Now I just need to go do my morning swim and then I'm off to the city.   Loads to write about but no time. Here's what's on my mind:   Cycling cadence Race preparation Running along the presidio in SF Moving to SF Finding people to train with
