Even to the point where you felt bad about yourself? When you start to down yourself and who you are, that is the devil lying to you. No matter what you do, nothing can separate you from the love of God (Romans 8:38-39). Hold tight to that truth and promise that God gives us. Think about your life and the things that you are holding onto that are lies about who you are. Those are places that the devil already has you. If you pray and ask God to free you of them and really believe that He will free you, you will be freed. Try to find someone that you can talk to about what you are dealing with. Anytime we bring things out from within us, we feel released of the burden it has on our lives. Take time today to pray and ask God to reveal to you what the devil has a hold of in your life. Then bring someone in your life to help you walk through those footholds.
