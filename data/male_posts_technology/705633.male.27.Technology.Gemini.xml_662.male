I bought a load of new clothes for about a third of the price,  I did my "call of the wild" hunting thing, went over sand dunes on quad bikes, got sun burnt and ate loads of awesome food. Unfortunately, going back to Capoeira I am now more like a stoned elephant than Neo. Hope to sort this out soon because there's a special teacher coming over soon and doing a three day course on the 26th, 27th and 28th for three hours each day. Beginners are welcome, if you're interested in a fun and extremely cool martial art then drop me a email.  I've had one night out with the lads since I got back, went to Paul Derrian's (hope that's the right spelling) birthday meal at Pesos, where he span some tunes and we ended up at Liquid. Photos are up in the album!
