It's really cool... there's a huge open reservoir (several hundred feet to a side) with banks going up to 100 feet tall... would be an awesome place to set off some mortars. There's also a wide street that no one uses yet that's awesome to try out skids and stuff on.  'Ne way, after that, I met Andrew and Jon at Wu's (a Chinese restaurant) and then went back to Andrew's for a night of fun. (lol) I just got home several minutes ago and felt like posting, so here I am...  Actually, I'm not that tired... that's not a good thing since I've slept through summer school this entire week. :P
