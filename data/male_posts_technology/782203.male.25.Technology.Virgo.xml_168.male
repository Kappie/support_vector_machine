So might be going to the IT fair at Suntec tommorow ..eventhough I got no cash at all to buy anything thanks to crappy management from a certain govt board. Then there's this local gig featuring various bands from NUS halls at Youth Park from 6 - 9 pm. Thinking of going to that one if can find someone to go with ..anyone interested? *looks pleadingly* . But I got the feeling most of the bands are probably going to sing chinese songs or cover bands like bon jovi  and linkin park *eek* but hopefully there's at least a few decent bands that I will like.
