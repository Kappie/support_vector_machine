Some very nice straightaways and some wicked turns.  There are a couple of nice jumps on the tracks, but they only occur right at turns - I would have loved for them to be on a straight bit - I just love getting the "Cool Air" kudos!  The new cars:  Some OK, some excellent.  The Radical SR3 is an incredible rocket, as long as you don't drop the revs.  The Ariel Atom 2 is a very, very fun car to drive.  The Nardo is sweet as well; I will have to find a niche for it.  The others don't thrill me too much, but I haven't tried all of them yet.  I also ranked up last night, so I am now rank 8 online.  I ranked up a couple of time offline as well, so I am rank 26 offline.  I still have much more to go.
