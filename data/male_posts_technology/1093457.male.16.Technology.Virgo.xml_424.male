I went to french second lesson which was actually quite handy, and then I went to see Miss Bashir with Scott and ssarah which was VERY helpful! She's set up a few more dates when we can go in adn see her to go through loads of stuff. Which is useful. Tomorrow I'm doing some more revision (wow!) and going in at 2.30 to see Miss Bashir. Then more work on my french aural, and then mum and I are going to spend the whole day on Wednesday going through them all so I'm fully prepared for Thursday, cos I'm soo nervous about it!  Other than that the day has been really boring, cos I've been revising all day! Not much to say really, so I'm going to go now! Bye
