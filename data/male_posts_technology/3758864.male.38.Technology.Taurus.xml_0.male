Kidnappings, beheadings, assasinations, and bombings have become a fact of life in Iraq, and for viewers around the globe. We're exposed to the gruesome details of cold blooded murder.  We see the lives of those that are in that country, as well as other countries in the region, snuffed out precisely because they have chosen to be there.  They have chosen to assist in the cause of freedom, and the end result is that their lives are sacrificed.  As we sit here less than 48 hours before the turnover of control, the panic is becoming evident in the resistance.  They've stepped up their kidnapping, heated up their rhetoric, and expanded their assault on the path to freedom.    These fanatics don't want freedom precisely because they understand that ultimately, it means that they will lose what power they have to rule through fear and intimidation.  The violence that they use to create their power has diminished results once the taste of freedom has been given to the millions of peace loving people who only want the opportunity to live their lives.  Most of us who don't have first-hand knowledge of what is going on over there, sit in utter bewilderment.  We wonder why it is that they would be so hellbent on stopping freedom in it's tracks.  We sit here and take these things for granted on a daily basis, and find it difficult to understand why others would be so disinterested in embracing freedom.    The terrorists who are working overtime trying to prevent freedom from reaching the masses are only serving to accomplish one thing.  They are strengthening the resolve of those that are determined to see freedom, in whatever form that involves, brought to fruition.  And, ultimately, the human desire to be free will overcome the desperate tactics of radicals determined to prevent that from happening.
