So all that firepower... all that " shock and awe "... all that bluster... what was that for?  All they managed to do was to separate the men (Saddam, Chemical Ali) from the boys (Uday, Kusay) and then killed the boys!  The men still live on...  There's a saying in Hindi for this...  Khoda pahaad, nikla chuha!!  which roughly translates into... "Dug up a mountain... and found a mouse!"
