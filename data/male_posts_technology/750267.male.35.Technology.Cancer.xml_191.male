Apparently, her son was briefly shown on the famous documentary made of Jackson's life that aired early this year. Due to the public outcry about Michael claiming he sleeps in the same bed as children, Jackson's people asked the mother to sign an affidavit and make an audio tape saying that things were alright. In February 2003, she did.  In May, according to her husband's lawyer, she still spoke very highly of Jackson, praising him. I bet if you were to ask around, you would find dozens of people who could testify that she praised Jackson often. It seemed like Jackson was the family's saviour -- paying their bills, buying them gifts.   The one day the gravy train ended. The money flow stopped.  Now, the mother says she was confused when she signed the affidavit, and didn't know what she was signing.  In my opinion, her story is starting to fall apart. Three questions arise: * If you didn't know what you were signing, how do you explain the audio tape testimonial? * If you were coerced into providing the testimonial, why were you still praising Jackson in May? * Why did these abuse allegations dating back many months only surface after Jackson stopped giving you money?  By claiming she was confused and/or coerced, she's basically claiming she was aware of the abuse 9 months ago. Given that Jackson paid for her son's medical treatment in the meantime, bought her a car, and paid her rent, one can assume Jackson still got to spend time alone with the child. What kind of mother allows her son to spend time with someone she knows is an abuser.  Basically, the story doesn't make sense. The family is apparently in hiding. For good reason I suppose, otherwise she might have to answer a few questions. Enquiring minds want to know.
