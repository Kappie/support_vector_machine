For instance, my friend FCW is going to be maid-of-honor at a wedding this weekend and she just found out what the groom is giving to his groomsmen as thank you gifts; fancy sets of amethyst multi-sided dice.  Oh wait, they are properly called " urlLink Dwarven Stones ".  Not surprisingly the groom is a dungeon master and he and his friends play all day every Saturday and the bachelor party consisted of a weekend of gaming.    I may be a big dork but I certainly won't giving gold-plated Illuminati cards or emerald-encrusted Green Lantern rings to the members of my wedding party!
