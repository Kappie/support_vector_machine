How is one supposed to properly balance all the rigorous demands of life with out letting one side dominate another?  Just consider all the complexities.  You need money to live, which generally requires work.  Of course you don't want to just work.  You want to work  for  something.  You have goals you want to reach.  You want to accomplish something; to leave your mark in this life.  Plant a tree.  Write a book.  Have a child.
 
 Which is segway into even more complexities: Family life.  I think most would agree that there are certain internal desires that drive you to socialize.  Your acquaintances can take many forms.  You have friends who give you steady and morale guidance in this life.  You have family who can be the most treasured of all companions.  And you have romantic interests who can be the most emotionally demanding of the lot.
 
 In between your external influences is yourself.  There are personal and spiritual endeavors which must be addressed in the coursing river of life.  Communing with higher forces, submersion in nature, and absorbing knowledge are significant aspects to knowing you -- to understanding who you are, why you are here, and where you want to go.  
 
 Understanding is the challenge of this.  Enlightenment lies in feeling how you want to prioritize these individual aspects.  I hesitate to say "individual" because they are not distinct.  They intermingle and bleed into one another.  You do business with friends.  Your job requires schooling.  You have crushes on your co-workers.  Time spent in one area is time lost in another.  It's an intricately complex matrix and solving the riddle is not easy.
 
 So let's revisit the question.  How do you balance life?  Career, Friends, Spirituality.  What are the criteria to prioritize?  How do you keep your ambition from driving away your loved ones?  How do you keep your desire to be with the one you love from putting your career on hold?  How can you keep from losing touch with God when you can't get a moment to breathe?  Does anyone know the answers?  May I speak to her?
