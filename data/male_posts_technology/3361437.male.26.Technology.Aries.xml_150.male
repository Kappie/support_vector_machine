   2002-2003 Presentation Dinner   
   25th July 2003 -    UTS Northern Suburbs Athletic Club celebrated 75 years since the establishment of the club with a gala Presentation Dinner at the North Ryde RSL.     
     My Granfather (Merv) was obviously at a presentation dinner back in 2003...now his photo is on the web forever!
