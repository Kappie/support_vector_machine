Bernie Ecclestones ability to influence and affect change through political manipulations are a case study on there own.  The natural foil for Ecclestones political desires is Max Mosely. Son of the "black shirts" Mosely and a political animal of his fathers and Ecclestones class.  The current problem is the sports declining appeal due to the dominance of Ferarri. What is required is a spark for the sport to draw the fans back and that is one Jacques Villeneuve, and although "Bernie" and "Max" fought the young Canadian at every turn, they now realize the value of his honest and direct nature.  Enter Sir Frank Williams who understands drivers best and the fact that Jacque was his last world champion and best opportunity for 2005. Jacques testing in France this week leaves one believing that the universe will align and the Canadian will drive for Williams soon.  Enter Patrick Head, partner in the Williams organization and technical genius. States the Canadian was in France not on the invitation of the team.  So Patrick was does this mean? I believe that the sport needs Jacque so badly, and the solution to Williams driver line-up is Jacque, that Sir Frank and Patrick feel they can poach Jacque and have the powers that be contract and pay the Canadian for his services in F1.  Bernie and Max have acquired Billion dollar fortunes through their alleged ownership of Formula One. Sir Frank and Patrick Head, who like other teams, do most of the real work in Formula One, is a modest man of maybe $100 million in net worth.  If Bernie and Max want Jacque in the sport they can pay for him, and the "league" will pay for his services. After all what is that saying "let the end user pay".   Watch out Bernie, your slipping, and by the way how come the Queen has not called yet to provide you with that much coveted knighthood?
