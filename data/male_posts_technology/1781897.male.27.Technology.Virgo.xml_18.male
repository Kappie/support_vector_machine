You see, this creates a fucken logistics nightmare in that my teleporting device is in the shop, my flex compacator is down, and my car is low on blinker fluid, so clearly I cannot chose the wine in front of me.  If only i could mount somthing on my motorcycle that would allow me to carry the clubs.....wouldn't that impress all the chicks!  That's one solution...another is....if the fuckn harvestor of sorrow would just ping me say.....45 minutes before tee time, it would be a non-issue.  Cock-ass!
