The kids were busy with a movie, so we sneaked upstairs laid on the bed, just cuddling and talking. One thing led to another, and we were soon both crying in an emotional mess. Well, I guess that was mostly me. The conversation went something like this:    R=I don't know how you can love me, I feel so not worthy, I feel like I let you down all the time.  A=I love you anyway  R=I have a hard time loving you in return because of the depression.  I think you would be happier without me.  A=I love you very much, I need you.  R=Sometimes when the "depressed-me" is in charge, I think about leaving for a long time.  A=[silence]  R=When "I" am in control, I know I could never leave you, but "I" am not in control most of the time. The "depressed-me" is in control often, and he wants to push everyone away and be miserable, run away from everyone, including you.  A=[still silent]  R=I know you love me, but I can't return that love very well. When the "depressed-me" is in control, I don't feel love for anybody, I don't want anyone to love me.   A=[still silent}  R=I can feel so alone, whether by choice or not, with you, with friends, with family, at work... at those moments I really need someone to ...  A=pay more attention?  R=yes, and pull me back into the moment and let me know that I'm okay, that you care even if I am being a jerk. I feel so damaged, so incomplete as a partner, a companion, a husband...  A=[silence]  R=and the other part of me just wants to ignore everyone and be left alone in the grey zone.  A=I need to be alone sometimes too.  R=for weeks or months? for several days in a row? enough to make you question everything you have ever done end every relationship you have?  A=No.  R=I know you love me, and I love you very much, even though I don't show it very well. I'm sorry I am so messed up, I'm sorry I am causing you so much stress over this.  A=I do love you, very much  R=I don't know how to make you understand how I can be happy and so sad at the same time.  A=[silence]    Well,  at least this is different than feeling nothing, right?      added 2:50 pm:      Later, she made a joke:    R=What are you thinking, about how to get rid of me and hide the body so you can collect the insurance?  A=No, I already know how to do that...    We will be OK, I'm pretty sure.  It's not her, it's me.
