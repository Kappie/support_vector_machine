Just Sunday hero, and I don't think she wants to talk to me anymore... :( Well, if anyone who reads this site, has an access code, I'd love to have it, so I could join and maybe "publish" some of my written words on it. (of course when I say "written words", I mean my poor excuse for poetry:)  check you guys latah
