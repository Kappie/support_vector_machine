Caught up with Lyndsey's older sister and her bf, so that was kool.  Jamie tried to get us into see the fireworks show :D, but to no avail, he couldn't get passes >.  As for what im doing today, well, as u can see by the time, I didn't get up until noon, lol, so not much going on today.  I think I have to work later this afternoon, but we'll see as the time goes.  My arms got very sunburned yesterday, and so did my face, so im gonna try to recover from that.  Later,  Eric
