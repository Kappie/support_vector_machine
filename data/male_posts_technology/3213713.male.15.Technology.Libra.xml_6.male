He told me the latest bout his love affair. Lol. Woh bhai to bohot hi aage pohonch gaye hein... hehehh. Then, I sat at my pc.... as soon as i logged in, a flood of msgs came. I began chatting... as always. Hassan online aaya. Played 2 games of pool with him. Score was level at 1-1 when he left. Neways, phir aik aur friend ke saath pool khela. But i had to teach her how to play first :p. Then, the office guy called and asked me if i had edited the page he had sent me. DAMN! I had completely forgotten it. Bari mushkil se Deeya ko manaya keh 10 min sabar kar le. Then, I made those changes and uploaded the page. Chatted some more. Then, I left and had lunch.  After lunch, mein office chala gaya. Showed them the page. Discussed another site. Then, they were sorting some CVs so i helped. At bout 4, I came back. I went to the forum and posted. Then, I went to Neowin and read news. Its nice to keep updated bout everything. Visited Spider's blog and read some more news. Then, I chatted some more. Ahsan came online. He forwarded me his mail to anum. My god. The love in their msgs. They had written poems for each other... hahahhah... kamal! Neways, esse hi time guzar gaya. Then, at bout 6. Farazeh came online. Chatted with her for a while. Hamza came. Went for jogging. Got back after 7. Sat at pc. Chatted with Farazeh. He told bout 2moro's concert. We thought of goin, but thought otherwise. Fazool hi tha. Hmmm.... then I had dinner. Came online and posted at the forum. Then, I watched TV and had mangoes. Phir, light chali gai so i had to go and sit outside. After some time, light aa gai. But bro begged me to give him the pc for some time. So, while he played, I lay down and relaxed. But 12 baje jab mein betha.... light light chali gai. Just one phase didnt go. Thank god, the pc was on that one.  I connected the cooler to that phase and sat at my pc. Farazeh was online as always :p. But shukar he aaj jaldi aa gai thi. I chatted with her. Then, she remembered that i had once promised to make a signature for her. So, I began making one. She sent me the pics. It took me bout 1 hour to make it. Meanwhile, Sana came online. I told her bout Gmail wagheira. Then, I told her bout the sig. She was chatting with Hanan and Farazeh. I told her to invite me. So, I joined their joint convo. Lol. Hanan really just types and types and types.... 4 baje tak chatting karte rhe...lol. Then, I left. Namaz parhi aur so gaya.
