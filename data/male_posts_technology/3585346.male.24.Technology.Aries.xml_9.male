Today is a great day, work was damn bloody smooth and that explain why I am home so early!  I realise I got a very nice boss. Very understanding as well, how I hope all the boss in the world is like him. Humble, Smart, Hardworking and Alert when he look blur blur. I got a lot to learn from him. Now I am really looking forward to take up some big projects but afraid I cannot handle it. Again if I do not try, I will never experience it so if screw,,,screw up lo.   It has been quite sometime since i went holiday overseas.....think I gonna plan one. Ok Let see my wish list according to chronological order...  Mitsubishi EVO 7 and above. Steamer for clothes. Webcam. Digital Camera.   And I hate irritating user plus ignorant user who screw their own configuration up when we have done it nicely. FUCK THEM! WAHAHAHAHA
