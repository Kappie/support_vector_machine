On the one side, you have the United States and Britain, who felt that invading Iraq was clearly in the best interests of long-term world peace. On the other side, there is the Rest of the World, who felt that launching a preemptive strike against a country who had done nothing recent to deserve it was the wrong thing to do, and not in the interests of world peace.  Both sides felt personally offended that the other did not support them on this important issue.  I can see both sides. And I'm personally torn (as I've written here many times).  Perhaps it's easier to think about the issue if we use an analogy....  Let's say you have a friend who wants to quit his terrible job and start an online casino. You tell him that there is no money in online casinos, but he doesn't listen to you. He quits his job the next day. A few months later, he is dead broke. He gets evicted from his apartment for not paying his rent, has to sell his car, and has no money even for food. He wants to come live with you (rent free), eat your food and borrow your car. What do you do?  On the one had, he brought this problem on himself. He didn't listen to you, and now he needs your help. To top it off, he's not even sorry for doing it, and it doesn't appear he's learnt any lesson from it. He was a bit of a jerk to you earlier, when you didn't support him quitting his job, and he has never apologized for it. In fact, he's still insisting online casinos are a great business to be in. You're seriously tempted to let him be homeless for a little while to teach him a lesson.  On the other hand, he's your friend. It's a bit cruel to let him suffer like that. You have room in your house, you have a good job and can support him for a little while without hurting yourself. This is your chance to act like a responsible adult, instead of getting your revenge as if you were in Grade 6.  So what's the problem here? You feel a bit upset that your friend was reckless, made his life a mess, and is now making your life a mess as well. Your friend is a bit upset that you weren't there for him a few months ago, and still aren't there for him. What happened to friends being there for each other no matter what the circumstances?  So, there it is. You have either got to step up and support your friend in his time of need, or that could be the end of the friendship. OR, does your friend need to swallow his pride and admit his mistake? Either scenario would solve the problem, but neither friend wants to be the one to make all the concessions.   In the rift between the U.S. and Europe, the end of the friendship could mean renewed tensions and hostilities for other matters. And nobody wants that.
