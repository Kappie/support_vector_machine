Despite minor technical difficulties in the first song the band shredded through the set list like it was a minor practice. We had great feedback about the songs and the performance and even though my bass had some problems I am definitely happy with my performance and very psyched for the next show. I'd like to thank all my friends who attended my first major appearance in a very long time. Your being there meant a lot. Also I'd like to give a big thanks to Nelson, Mike, Kris and Larry for making me a member of the group. I will keep everyone posted on upcoming Third Rail outings. The Third Rail web site at www.thirdrailrocks.com will be up soon too!!!! So that is another great way of keeping track. Currently the set dates we have are private parties, but since we are "the band that cares" we will be back real soon. Stay tuned as allways!!  - Rick
