Tuesdays are fruit and cereal days, and this lady was here to get her fill.  She came in with a box full of food already in hand, grabbed four ( FOUR! ) boxes of Lucky Charms and disappeared.  Now, I normally would have said something.  Okay, no I wouldn't.  But believe me, I would have given her a scornful look if not for one thing -- she was pregnant.  So I took it easy on her.  I swear...pregnancy is the latest epedimic in this building.  It's been going on for two years now.  I hope I don't catch it...
