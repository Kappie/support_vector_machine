The show starts at 2pm PST / 5pm EST so if you'd like a chance to get a Gmail invite for free then make plans to stop by. If the crowd is large enough then we might give away more than one during the show. I'm also going to be giving away one at our parent blog: Things That ...  urlLink Make You Go Hmm  and one invite here at this blog. Details to follow soon so subscribe to our blogs and keep an eye for your chance to win a coveted Gmail invite!
