This year will be the third annual reunion, and we expect the same fun (lots of it) as the years before.  (If Mamaw's funeral counted as a reunion, would this year's be the third or fourth reunion?  Anyway, we can never expect the same fun as provided at  that  event.)  Some of you are unable to attend this year.  I would like to take some stories with me on your behalf, tell 'em around the camp fire.  Eldest son, could you please clear up this confusion in my head about "Yeah, the winners, Bob and Jack!" and Joe Joe creating a tornado with his newspaper to blow down your house of cards?"  Did these incidents occur at the same time?  Was it really our beloved grandfather who crushed your artistic spirit forever?  Gock, how about you?  Besides running from Mamaw after putting out papers, what did you do with your grand folks?  Maybe you weren't running; again, I think I have my stories mixed up.  You and Mamaw were pretty close, if I remember correctly.  And Daya Daya, surely you have the most to tell us, what with being their favorite and all.
