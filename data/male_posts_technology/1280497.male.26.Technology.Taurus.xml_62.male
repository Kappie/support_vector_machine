Because I get to press one button and have all the latest articles from the Washington Post, Motley Fool, Slate, and a bunch of other, random weblogs in a list for my perusal. I'm excited because I might (MIGHT) be able to get RSS to work for my weblog. If that happens, you could subscribe and never have to come to this sad site to see if today is one of the once-in-an-elephant's-life days that I actually make a post.   I started with Sharpreader to get an aggregator. Then, it was just a matter of learning how that program works, and adding sites that support RSS. Now, I'm twenty pounds lighter, Julie loves me more, and I can retire next August! Or at least have great information at the touch of a button. Easier than regular Internet websites? Pretty much.
