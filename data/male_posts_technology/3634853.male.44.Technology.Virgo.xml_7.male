Although I know better, my thought processes really suck right now as I haven't been getting much for starting cards and when I do have a hand they aren't holding up.    At one point I showed my wife where for 7 hands in a row I had 2xos with nothing higher than an 8.  Right after that I asked her " now at some point don't you think I should be getting AX suited 5 or 6 times in a row?"  She laughed out loud.  It kind of made me think how frustrated I was sounding, and probably silly too, but at the same time, I haven't seen yet where you get a good streak that lasts anywhere near as long as the bad ones.  I'm hoping that soon I catch one of those "hot" streaks that you're able to sustain, but it hasn't happened yet.  Anyway, I plan on going home this afternoon and doing some analysis in PokerTracker.  I want to make sure there aren't any loops I'm opening up as a result of how things have gone.  Also, I want to make sure that my study and reflection habits remain in place regardless of  my short term results.  I still think that the goal I set is attainable and look forward to the progression of my game.  I also still believe that with diligence, commitment, patience, and discipline I can bring my game to at least another level.  That next level should get me beyond the casual or undedicated player and help me to supplement my income as I am hoping.  Enough crying for now
