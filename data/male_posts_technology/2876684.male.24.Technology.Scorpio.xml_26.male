Saturday - Had lunch with my relatives, nothing too exciting. Ended up "guarding the fort" with Shane (my cousin Carmina's boyfriend) while they went shopping! Oh well, they haven't spent any real time together as a family since Carmina's moved out.  Sunday - Nothing of note, my body still hurt from all the sparring!  Monday - I went out shopping for PC speakers and came home with 2 DVDs and 2 new PC games. I briefly contemplated going to see "The Passion of the Christ", since it was Easter and all. But that changed once I got home and sat in front of my PC - damned tool of the devil!!!  I guess I wanted to accomplish more with my free time, but my body was racked with bruises and pain from the whole week of fighting - I initially wanted to train with Shihan on Saturday and Sunday as well, but I realised in hindsight I would probably be coughing up blood and nursing bruised ribs.  I wasn't really looking forward to training hard today coming off the long weekend, and Shihan didn't show because he got caught up with other things. John went through some stuff with me and I'm glad to say I'm picking up a lot of things from him. At this rate, I should be ready come Christchurch in June. :)  Fighting is so much more a mental game than it is physical - John proved that to me by not showing any sign of even being flustered after I hit him with everything I had. Apparently I had winded him good, but he didn't show me... and boy, did I feel useless at the time!  8 1/2 weeks and counting to NZ - make it count, man.
