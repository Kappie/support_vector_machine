The Second Law : When someone’s explaining something to you and you’re not getting it, it’s not your problem, it’s their problem. So I guess it must be my problem on both counts. So much for playing  advocatus diaboli .  Since you guys wanted something interesting, the above two laws are from Tim Bray. Any guesses on who he is?
