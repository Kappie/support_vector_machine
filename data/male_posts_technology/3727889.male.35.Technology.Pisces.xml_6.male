I then entered another $5 tourney and came in first again. Go figure. My style of play seems well suited to tourneys.   I have been using Poker Tracker, but to be honest, I have no idea what any of the stats mean. I do see that I am not an aggressive player (where I would have said I was tight/aggressive). Maybe my lack of aggression allows me to get into the final 3, then loosen up and win! Could be a good strategy.   Here are the finishing moves on my last tourney.
