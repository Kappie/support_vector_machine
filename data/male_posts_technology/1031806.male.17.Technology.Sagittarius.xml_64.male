I slept in on Saturday (I really needed it - had had almost no sleep the past week), and helped cater at a Christmas play done by Southwest Hills that night.  I think I ate one meal the entire day. :)  I got to Calvary slightly early on Sunday, cause the tech guys were testing a new digital board, and I was riding with some of the musicians.  During second service, Brady, Steven, Cameran, Emily, and I walked a couple blocks over to Carl's Jr. ... in the pouring rain ... in my suit.  :)  We spent prolly 45 minutes over there, and walked back.  I then donned a regular jacket in place of my suit, and we walked a couple more blocks over to the theater to buy tickets for another showing of Nemesis.  After we all saw the movie (all 25 of us), I went over to Goody's house and stayed for about half an hour before getting picked up, and driven back home.  Today, by contrast, was rather uneventful.  Oh, and I finally got Gwen's aim screen name, after weeks of forgetting to ask her for it.  :)  *Happy*  Feeling: Hunger, Tiredness, Anxiety about the upcoming Learner's Permit test tomorrow.
