If we spend more time in these things than reading the word, praying, and studying Christian books, then I would suggest we have a very serious problem. Where you spend your time is where your heart is.       As was quoted to me recently (and it went something like this:- "If you spend more time listening to, watching, and reading about a lie, than you do listening to, watching, and reading about the truth, eventually you will begin to see the lie as truth, and the truth as a lie."  Food for thought chaps. And I believe that this is one of the key reasons why the youth of the Church are so weak in faith. Did I say believe? And I am convinced that this is one of the key reasons why the youth of the Church are so weak in faith.
