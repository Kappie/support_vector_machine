I am not totally sure on the details of the illness but I do know that she is still able to communicate through body language and she can listen. This is a very sad period for the Brophy family since she is a very well respected mother of four children (one who happens to be my father). Its really quite a shame that this had happened because I really wanted to see my grandparents this summer since I really don't have any recollection of their characters, personality's, physical appearances, and don't really know them at all since we live on opposite sides of Canada (east and west or Montreal and British Columbia). One thing I know is that for the longest time I had not been in contact with my dads side of the family (The "Brophy's") until the last year when we began exchanging emails and even making plans to meet but lately since my grandmothers illness it seems like we are coming together and keeping in contact to keep up-to-date on my grandmothers condition so in a small way this is good because it brings family together in a time of tragedy. I have never really suffered a loss of anybody really close to me or anyone related to me in blood that I can remember but I am sure it is hard for my father and his brothers since their mother was so involved in their upbringing and was partly responsible for the type of people they became. Its just quite hard to imagine that without her giving birth to my father, my father would not have been able to give me life and the fact that I have no recollection or memory of this person of importance to me just makes me a bit disappointed because what am I going so tell future generations of brophy's if they ever ask about my grandmother.     I know that if I was sick and had a high chance of death then I would seriously be considering some spiritual guidance (even tho I don't personally believe it because I am a atheist) at the moment because you are doing something that nobody has ever been able to come back and talk about. Its like entering a foreign land and leaving your loved ones but not knowing if there is everything you could have ever imagined or just nothing at all happens and your just plain gone. I don't mean to be blunt or cold but after maturing a little I realize that life is quite brutal and usually what you expect is not what you get.     I am really hoping that my grandma Claire brophy will be able to pull through this somehow even tho the illness she has is extremely serious because we only realize how much we miss someone when they are gone and we wish there is something more we could have done at the time but what is done is done.     **anyways IM going to go have another mid night snack so i'm off the computer. PS: Grandma Claire, even tho I am a atheist I will be wishing you all the luck in the world to fight that illness for as long as possible. Remember, perseverance is the key to success in life so never give up and don't surrender when the going gets tough.**
