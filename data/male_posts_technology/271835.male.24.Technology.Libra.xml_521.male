Today is  urlLink Beltane , an ancient Gaelic festival. Well it is tomorrow actually but the celebrations take place on the night before - like Christmas Eve for pagans  wiccans. Probably.     Religious question of the day - how do pagans know how to do their ceremonies? They seem to be all based on these ancient holiday dates which are all pre Roman. If this is the case there are no written records from that time so the pagans must either be guessing what went on or they must be in possession of the oldest British documents. Ever. You decide.    I'm off to dance around a fire, making up a quasi religion as I go.
