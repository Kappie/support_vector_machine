Why then, someone please tell me, did this bastion of liberal propaganda have  urlLink Wolf Blitzer  and  urlLink George Will  reporting and/or commentating on the Democratic nominee's speech (along with the ineffectual Judy Woodruff)?  Those two were snarkily sniping at Kerry's speech even before the baloons trickled down.  A truly liberal outlet would've had pundits glowing about how brilliant Kerry was, not how he glossed over his 20-year senate career and how his speech was lacking in specifics (as if an acceptance speech is on par with the State of the Union).    Liberal media?  Puh-leeze!  Not in the mainstream.  You gotta go to  urlLink Air America Radio  and  urlLink Democracy Now!  (if you can find them in your town).
