They have to evade reality as we generaly accept it and live out a happy and product alternative life through a character they create. Granted all games are a means to escape the real world and to have fun. I hold nothing against people who escape by this means, i am one of them. I feel confident in making these statements after ten years of observing and exploring the networld and D style RPGs. I just wish that there was a way get over some of the ego personal traits people have and a way to help people address the social skills they may lack in the shared real world we live in.  I am trying to explain the point at when i stopped hiding and started living the real life.  Though the more i look for an example of it the more i fear maybe i have not started yet.
