Even sacrificed a few hrs from my final year project to prepare to prepare for the test. Just felt a bit wasted lor. And I think it's a wake up call that my prep work was insufficient. Think I'll use the holidays to brush up. Gonna go borrow tapes and do all the exercises from page 1 onwards!! Gambatte!!!!!  Today had my project inspection. Woohoo quite good and encouraging. I was kinda panicky over it but I think the lecturer was satisfied about my progress. He just wants to make sure I know how to do what I want, and that I know what I really want done. I think I'll spend more hours on my FYP this holidays too. In addition still got about 2 modules I think I need to read up on and 2 essay questions I need to work on. I may be a bit greedy but I think I'll try to finish the 2 essays early during the holidays. But I foresee that I'm probably only going to finish 1 1/2 of the 2 qns. Bopian. Try my best liao lor. Dun wanna waste away this holiday too much. I'll of coz rest a bit too lah. But I know for sure that 2 days before and after X'mas will be quite a slack day for studying coz of X'mas dinner and all that.  GAMBATTE Aylwin-san!! Gambatte!
