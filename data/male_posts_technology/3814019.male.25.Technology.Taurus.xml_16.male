The Kids love the little rides and the stupidly dressed workers. The Parents love the fact the Kids aren't clinging to their legs and are out of their hair. Now I am proud of the fact I come under neither of those categories, I am not a Kid, and thankfully I am not a Parent. So it is safe to say it defies all known logic that a man such as I should want to partake in going to the Armpit of Warrington to get randomly smacked into by little sprogs and getting funny looks by adults for being the only 25 year old.   I really wish Dante was still alive today, I would go round to his house and drag him by his hair all the way to Gullivers World and explain to him that when he came up with our latter day perception of Hell he couldn't have been further from reality. Hell is a place in Warrington. Hell is walking round a manmade complex surrounded by people you don't belong with. Hell is discovering every single purveyor of crap in the place you are stuck in refuses to sell real coke and tries to palm you off with Virgin Cola. Hell is spending 4 hours in a kid infested nightmare then discovering you are only half way round the place and have another 4 hours to go. Hell is a place where your girlfriend refuses to accept your honest assessment of your contortionist skills every time she tries to persuade you to go on a ride designed for people under 5 foot.  Hell is two mice miming abba songs on a podium "for the kiddies" who clearly don't have the foggiest who the hell abba are and would have been happy with pretty pictures and mirrors that make them look weird. Hell is spending time with someone else's family and being the centre of cringingly embarrassing conversations that normally start with the line "aww, you look sooo good together, but..". Hell is being told to cheer up by a man that looks like he just discovered he is going to have his john thomas amputated by shortsighted spoon wielding monkey with bad hygiene. Hell is Gullivers World.
