I'm not nearly that thoughtful or tortured a soul. It's a big goddamned front. I was playing at being overtly cynical because secretly I feel so giddily optimistic about where this blogging thing could take me. Artistically.   I imagine myself sitting down at a coffee shop somewhere while I pour over the constructive comments posted about my blog and, by extension, myself. The creative inspiration literally gushes out of me. This upwelling causes quite a commotion and I'm asked to leave. I cross the street to another coffee shop where I bravely churn out page after page of my novel, taking breaks only to finish my short stories and order more scones.  I'm immediately the talk of the goddamned town--all towns really. And then the imagining ends more or less and a blithe feeling of contentment takes it's place.  This is what blogging seems to do for me and it's awesome and I feel I'm definitely going places. Though once again in the interest of veracity, the delusions aren't new, just more frequent.   Oh and some kid told me my blog title sucks, so I'm going to change it. The first couple of words in this post should do.  'Kid' being a term I use for people whose opinions I respect and who have at one time or another criticized myself or my actions.
