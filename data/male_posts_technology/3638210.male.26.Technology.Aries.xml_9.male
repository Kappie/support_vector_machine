Once because some guy at my school got to see Sheryl Crow and I wanted to support my kitchen window's 3 seconds of stardom when the limo came to pick him up.  The second time I was just flipping through, but this particular "FAN" left such an immediate impression, I had to watch the rest.  The celebrity was Jennifer Lopez.  And they start out by introducing you to the fan and giving a few FANatic bullet points.  This girl's name was Michelle or something.  Now, understandably, the people on this show aren't just fans... they're fanatics, hence the clever title.  So what this means, dear viewer, is that instead of posters on the wall, these people have life-size cardboard cut-outs.  Where a fan would have an autograph, FANatics have bits of hair.  And while many would jump at the chance to see their idol behind closed doors, a greater majority would prefer seeing them from behind nearby bushes.  So, fun facts about Michelle...  FAN FACT#1: Michelle tells her mother to refer to her as "Jennifer" whenever she calls to leave a message.  The camera zooms in on an answering machine and sure enough, we hear a woman's voice telling "Jennifer" to meet her at 8 or something to that effect.  We're already off to quite a start here.  FAN FACT#2: Whenever Michelle eats at home she makes sure to leave a space for Jennifer just in case she comes by.  Michelle and her mom are sitting at a small round table across from one another eating lasagna while a third empty dish is set, complete with fork, knife, and an 8x10 glossy of J-Lo propped in front.  The only thing that saves Michelle here is the fact that she didn't go ahead and serve her perpetually absent guest, though I don't know if that's enough to comfort me at this point.  FAN FACT#3: Michelle thinks that Jennifer would be a good person to eat Coochie Fritos with.  What!?  This is where I completely lose any degree of understanding.  First of all, what are Coochie Fritos?  A Puerto Rican delicacy?  If not, do I want to know?  And second, though perhaps even more important, what exactly constitutes a "good person" to eat said Coochie Fritos with?  I watched the rest of the show secretly hoping that Michelle had smuggled some in to the interview for the two to share.
