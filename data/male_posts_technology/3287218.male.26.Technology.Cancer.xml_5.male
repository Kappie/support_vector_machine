Then I went to my house to make sure there was no water damage and then left to go a girl's house.  We watched a movie, "Brother Bear", and then I left around 11ish.  I went back the apartment and found that my computer rebooted, I log back on and realize that the internet is not working.  B4 I have a chance to do anything, my roommate unplugs the power to the router and modem.  He then reconnects it, still no go.  I then realize that the PC link is not coming on the modem.  I was not happy.    So I connected my computer directly to the modem and then procceded to get onto the net.  Sooo...the internet is working.  At this point my roommate had gone to bed.  Well...I decided to call Netgear (the manufacturer) and see what they could do for me.  I call them and the lady voice told me that I need to register my product to get a 90-day "warranty" for support on the router.  So I do and then I call them back.  I then get someone and he says, I cant find your router.  I was like "SHIT".  I registered it and then I realized that Netgear has 2 different forms to register.  So I fill out the correct one and then call back.  After 45 minutes of waiting on hold and troubleshooting, it comes down to an RMA.  So they tell me that I would need to pay shipping.  So I am like cool.  BUT they said that I would get a refurbed router.  I am like NO.  So I said, I will look into returning it and or buying a new one.  Ok...that was all last night....TIME FOR BED.................ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!   Now onto Monday...I get up around 9:30 and then go to Circuit City and buy the same router for $101, saved about $20.  So now I have the new router up and running.  And then it hit me.  I spend 5 bucks for shipping and then get a refurbished router and turn around and sell it.  HEHE...I AM SO SMART!!!!!!!!!  So I need to call Netgear and get an RMA setup and then go ship it today.  Thats all for today.  Something else might happen, who knows.
