I mean, icle face stabbing, blood freezingly fucking cold. However I have had a few days of great snowboarding. I can now handle all greens and most blue runs with ease. Yesterday I did a spectacular bail. I was at the top of a really steep run, and our instructor, Forrest (yes, his real name - much piss ripping by me.. AND he looks the spit of Fred Durst) said we could handle it. Like a lamb to the slaughter, I went down first.. I carved once, twice, three times.. then fell on my ass and slid about 60 foot down the mountain side in a ball of snow and limbs. I eventually came to rest besides sniggering group of skiing children. Oh, the humanity.  In Canada, there is a law that states all bars must have at least 5 maple leaf flags, 4 pairs of antique skis and a minimum 400 photographs of ice hockey players.   The Canadian accent is simple and mildly irritating, and involves changing any "o" to an "ooou" and ending every sentance with "eh?", eh?  The TV is four channels of ice hockey, three channels of figure skating, a couple of annoying teeny-bopper music channels and, bizarrely, strong man competitions.  However in spite of this small cultural differences I am having a blast. The beer is cold, the women (especially waitresses) are really hot. I haven't fallen off any chair lifts yet either.  I am still in need of a couple of decent nights out on the sauce. Most nights I have been so knackered from snowboarding I have barely had the strength to eat my dinner, let alone perform some of my more complex dance moves.  Here's my 2 cents on the cat v dog thing..  Dogs are good for unconditional, completely stupid and utterly adoring love. Good for girls that are on the rag, for example. Cats however, provide hours of enterainment by falling off furniture, killing small animals and ignoring you.  But most importantly, cats make better eating.  Toaster signing off, peace and love to all, man.
