I get a message from Toaster at about 4pm informing me that there is a general piss up happening at 'THE tm Bar', so I give him a call, so far so good. Anyway, I turn up at about 6pm to find Toaster, Kirk, Dougal and some others who I know from elsewhere, already fairly drunk. Now at this point I am intending to drink water (yes yes I know!) as I am intending to drive home because I have a busy Saturday ahead of me! This plan works very well until we moved over to 'Chicago Rock' at about 8pm. Yup we got there and before I knew it, I had forgotten that I wanted to drive and I was participating in tequila rounds!!! Then we carry on working our way into the cocktail list like there is no tomorrow!!!  Now! I guess this is going to sound rather stupid, but then again, most things I do concerning girls are!  I think I have fallen for one of the bar staff at Chicago! Yup there we are drinking away, I'm not drunk yet and I notice someone behind the bar that just .... blows me away! I mean there are loads of great looking babes out in Jersey but there are just some people that when you lay eyes upon them you turn to mush, and this was one such person. I don't know if it was her Irish accent that got me or what but I was fallen! Anyway, so being the shy twat that I am, I didn't say a bloody word to her for most of the night (bangs his head against the wall!). I really wish I could get over this whole shy thing, it drives me mad that when I like someone I can't react to it. So time is getting on and I am still trying to think of something to say, when she walks over and asks me what drinks I am having!....so I gave my order and she gets them for me.....then Toaster decides to take action and introduce me to her (cheers man). At this point there is no turning back as it's probably my only chance lol! So I said hello and found out that it's her birthday in a couple of weeks time and that she will be at Chicago for it...YAY! So I tell her that I'll come down and buy her a drink and she gives me a smile that makes me mush again! Then unfortunately, she has to go serve someone else, but at least the initial deed is done and I wasn't totally shit!  Thing is, I really want to go to Chicago and see her again (call me sad, call me what you will, I don't care). I guess I am just deluding myself that I'd even have a chance but we must all dream!  So another point that I must make at this juncture.....a big SORRY to Donna, one of our very first Toasterfilettes. It appears that she contacted us a while ago on the message board and we totally blanked the messages!!! I would formally like to apologize to you Donna, and confess that it was me that deleted the photos you mentioned last night (see Donna works in Chicago Rock too). I believe that we took another photo last night and hopefully Toaster will have it on the site soon. Please chat us again, as you are and always will be a Toasterfilette to us! Now I am not going to grovel too much as I know that really in her heart she forgives us and wouldn't want us to go that far anyway hehe!  Anyway, I have shit loads to get on with, and it's beginning to piss me off! So I am going to have to say bye for now, back soon.   Baity signing off......
