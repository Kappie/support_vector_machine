I did one cold spagghetti salad...very healthy with low fat mayonaise and while preparing the food...i have felt like Jamie, The Naked Chef in UK...with me slicing the salad leaves reallly professionally, mixing in the tunas , lime , cold spagghetti , some black pepper ....and wishing more stuff could be added... Oh well i made enough to serve one whole family...Now it is just sitting in my fridge ..cool and healthy and juicy..hmm...made my saliva drip again..  I was thinking of adding some bacon bits, tomatoes...and some salsa sauce...arrrgghh..another trip to Tesco is needed.  Perfecting the recipe is needed  and most probably i can replicate the recipe again next time . Probably try it out again on the Au Yong family and proved to some ppl like Amkayell and Jamie Neoh..that Joshua Tan can really cook and not just blabbering away like usual.. that i am a well trained house - husband...hehee..hehe.. just one of my wacky ambitions...  Have to stay off blogging as lotsa work is piling up what with work , emailing , and even preparing prayer list for the COUZ camp committee..  Pictures for COUZ Leader Retreat will come soon as i am gonna download from Millia's digicam ..which suprisingly shared the same XD slots...and have to resized to post it unto the blog.  so soon i will add pics to this posting to show my final work on the cold spagghetti salad.hehehe  :P Joshua Tan
