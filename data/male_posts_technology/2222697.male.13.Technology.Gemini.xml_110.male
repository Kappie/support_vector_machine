I had one with squall as one of you may have seen while I was at b I can edit it fine, but I would have to change all the titles to be like they used to be and manually do all my archives.  That means, a lot of work for me, and the same thing for you.  I am gonna stick with this one until I move and have more time (summ3r).  Well the gist on what is happening: My brother's friend was not accepted into the same college as him, so my brother is coming to tyler with us...sad thing and happy thing.  My parents have to deal with my b-day, bro's graduation, moving, and going to A-kon even when it is 2 hrs away  in the same 3 weeks   YAY fred from MT is coming to a-kon, geez I have to meet him. One of my favorite people.  Sp33king of fred I bought the re-issue of vol. 1 of MT, It has bonus stuff!  I will give a review later otherwise  I'M OUT!!   LL4MA
