They managed to lose 2 - 1 to France the other day after leading at the 90 minute mark. Now France are playing Croatia .. I had a few hours sleep but I have been up since 11:30 pm. For some reason I find watching the games live so much more exciting, it seems worth it to miss the sleep. Guess I need to get in training for the baby anyway. Bun is coming up on 14 weeks, and we have 4 weeks until our reception, which will be an interesting event. More surprises for the attendees! Hehe. My plan is to announce the baby to the world as part of my speech at the wedding reception. Should see a few jaws drop then I think. This weekend we head to Sydney for the night on Saturday to see Australia - Scotland rugby test, and the following weekend we have tickets for Australia - England rugby at Suncorp Stadium. Lots of sport at the moment!
