Anyway, I'm scanning some pictures cause I want to update my  urlLink Unwelcome hero  as I have not done that in quite some time. For those of you just turning in. It's snowing outside, and I'm hoping to work from home at least a little tomorrow. It's finally sticking to the roads, but not our driveway. Weird.  So anyway, I got an email from  urlLink my friend , and figured that was a good reason enough to send you all(you know who you are, all my invisi-friends:)) to her. So there.  Also, you'll notice my shameless plug earlier about my unwelcome hero. I'm thinking of putting part of my intro for my book up... we'll see how drunk I get tonight;) (that's where cliff and his friends went, to buy alky:) $125 worth :P WooHOO!!!  Well, I'll check you latah- T
