I figured it was the least that I could do. Here is a snippet of what I got back, written by one of his personal assistants. "I just wanted to pass on Erwin's sincere thanks for your encouragement.  He has read every one of his emails and has been truly touched and energized by emails such as yours.   He thanks you for your words, and wishes you all the adventure that the Lord has in store." So wait a minute, he's been touched and energized by an email that I wrote...  Now that's pretty cool.  It's really the least that I could do.  And he wishes me the adventure...  Dude.
