I have just been checking out the hotel it looks fantastic - the Beverley Wiltshire Hotel on Rodeo drive (or something like that) I'm looking forward to the long haul flight (hopefully in a 747 - yes I'm a plane fan!!!!!) - and the VIP behind the scenes visit to Paramount (my fav show STAR TREK is made there!).  I'd been trying to calm myself down all day and saying I've already won a great prize and not to get down if I didn't win the draw (which I thought it was going to be). I've been on edge all day looking at our wedding venue in Liverpool (the Palm House in Sefton Park - its lovely). Then at 16:45 I get a call saying be prepared for 'battle' at around 17:30 and they would get all the weeks winners on air to guess an 'amount' and nearest would win.  No call at 17:30, I'm getting increasingly more nervous, then I get called at 17:45 and we start after the track has finished. I'm bricking it BIG style!!!!! getting more nervous then the DJ asks 'How long on average each year do LA residents spend in traffic jams?' nearest wins!  First contestant says 700 odd hours, next person says 600 odd, I'm next and all through I was thinking 150 odd hours, but after hearing the rest, I think, god I must be really under estimating and in America they do commute further! So I go for 500 hours. The person after me then says 800 I think.  The DJ then does the old dramatic pause and says Phil's the lowest with 500 and the answer is 150 (or was it 120) - Phil's the nearest - and I nearly faint with shock. I was with Beth's family at the time we all nearly had heart attacks, the memory of that moment will last forever.   Fantastic! a Holiday in LA in a 5 star hotel, Mini for the week and well great really, words fail me. I was in tears and quite choked.  This win has got to be the best so far!  Good luck all
