According to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, a relationship is:  Main Entry: re·la·tion·ship  Function: noun 1 : the state of being related or interrelated   2 : the relation connecting or binding participants in a relationship: as a : KINSHIP b : a specific instance or type of kinship 3 a : a state of affairs existing between those having relations or dealings   b : a romantic or passionate attachment  Today we're going to deal with the last definition, or rather, the romantic relationships.  Let me offer an analogy, since I can't get my point accross in other ways.  Think about duets.  The thing about duets is that each singer brings out the best in the other singer.  A good song to duet is a song that is based on both singers strangths and weaknesses.  Men can date many women but in reality, few women bring out the best in men (and vice versa).  If both parties understand each other well (stregnths and weaknesses) and know the tune they are going to sing (share a common goal and strategy to acheive that goal) then can bring out the best in each other as they work together.  This really shows the importance of exclusivity and commitment in a relationship.  A lot of people (both men and women) don't understand why it's important and are just satisfied with the physical aspect of it.  But, it is through these stages of learning that you undertand your mate/significant other and share your visions.  In duets, each singer has a distinct score.  It would have been boring if it was the same.  Similarly, people will get bored with the "same" person.  Despite the differences, duets sound beautiful and the key is harmony.  When these singers harmonize, each singer will listen to the other party and creatively repond with their own melody.  This shows the importance of active listening as our partner shares their parts and creativity in relationships.  Woemn and men don't need to conform.  Each can still maintain their own individuality and don't have to lose their freedom.  I guess that's that.  Being in a relationship means that you don't win them all and you don't lose them all either.  It's being in a happy medium.  I suppose it's some sort of comfirmation to the old addage that "Opposites Attract"  I hate to use cliches again but really, if your mate was just like you in everyway, you would eventually get bored with that and look for something else.  If they were like you, they would have the same strengths and weaknesses and there really wouldn't be any sort of complementing each other nor growth.  Sure you can have the same interests and thoughts but in the end there has to be something different about the person who you are in a relationship with that complements you and something that you are different from them that complements them.  These differences can also be the source of fights in a relationship.  Because of these differences, people take things differently.  Something might mean the world to you but your partner doesn't think much of it (or vice versa).  That can definitely be a source of misunderstandings and fights.  The point is you have to communicate with each other to have a healthy relationship.  Talking, actually more specifically communicating with each other is essential.  Along with being committed, honest, respectufl, open, caring, thoughful, supportive, strong, funny, sponteneous, intelligent etc.  In conclusion, being in a relationship is hard work.  Go past all the emotions and feelings that make everything seem fine and dandy and and you find work.  It's up to you if you want to jump into that pile of work.  If you keep up the work and the other person is also working with you, then there's so much to gain if both people keep working on it and share the same goal and strategy.  That's enough of me rambling today.
