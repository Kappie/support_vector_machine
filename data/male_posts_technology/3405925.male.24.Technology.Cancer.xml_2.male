Born 1676 in Scotland, Selkirk was a shoemaker and at the age of 19, in 1695 he sailed out to sea after deciding that he had enough of the village life. Within 8 years, he was the captain of his own ship. He then joined the famous pirate William Dampier and in 1704 after getting involved in a quarrel with the captain, he wanted to be dropped off on the inhabited island of Juan Fernandez, which is 400 miles from the coast of Chile.  When stepped foot on the island he had a pound of gun powder, an axe, carpenter tools, clothes, a sleeping bag, the bible etc., while he was eating mussels and waiting for ships to come and rescue him and sleeping at the shore, he got scared of the sea lions and decided to explore the island, and he found drinking water, which was the key to his survival along with the wild goats and wild vegetables. His first major problem was the wild rats attacking during the night time, and he solved that problem by domesticating wild cats. He lit fires to signal ships passing by and the first ones to find him were the Spanish which were at war with England at that time. Selkirk had to flee to depth of the island twice to escape the Spanish soldiers who saw his signal and came to check it out. He was milking his tamed goats, gardening and raising crops, reading the bible loud not to lose his ability to speak; after a while he had ran out of gunpowder, his clothes and shoes were torn and battered but running after goats all the time had made him an expert hunter and walking on granite all the time had made his feet strong enough to walk barefoot all the time and the leather from his goats provided him the necessary materials that he needed to make basic clothing, isolation to keep his quarters warm and bedding. After about a year the island gave everything that Selkirk could possibly ask for. He was rescued in 1709 by a captain named Woodes Rogers whose ship belonged to a company which belonged to the same Dampier who had left him on that island 5 years ago. Despite his isolation he was given the title of lieutenant and then promoted to captain later. He returned to England in 1711, lived in Scotland for a while, got married, then returned back to sea and died from yellow fever at the age of 45 at sea, somewhere on the west coast of Africa.  The island of Juan Fernandez is known as the The Island of Robinson Crusoe, has a population of 700 and the locals are mainly occupied with lobster hunting, the island next to that was named Alexander Selkirk; both islands are territory of Chile, the town of Largo Scotland has a statue of Selkirk and his parents graves are still in the graveyard and are a tourist attraction.
