My mom tries to get everything done and cares about everybodys opinion about her work. So my dad ordered a two entree at panda express and my mom said "they asked it it was in the restaurant or to go"  My dad got mad and didnt eat anything. So everyone is mad.....  Oh and When we drove up to the food place we saw two cops walk into the gamestop. I think some scrawny white kid stole a copy of DOA volleyball....  Wait.....   I know the description fits me but I dont like DOA!     ALT COMMAND OF THE DAY!!!!  Alt-654=  Ã„
