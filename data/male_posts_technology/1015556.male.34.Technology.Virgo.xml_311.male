It is usually a pretty fun time for me, as I get a few minutes to talk about SPACE and everyone there is really intersted.  It's cool. I went last night to give them an update, and thought, lucky blog reader, that you might like to see it too. So here it is. All in all, its kind of a God given dream and vision come true...  ===  GCC Youth Ministries SPACE summer missions  Trip Breakouts: Light Company – 6th – 8th graders: Service based weekend working at CMTS.
