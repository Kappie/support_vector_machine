This caused problems in the recent past as I was unable to have Blogger publish directly to my site via FTP. I used a workaround but it wasn't pretty. Long story short - the new comment feature wouldn't have dynamically updated until I manually updated the site. I didn't like that, so now I'm here. When you send your comment, it should show on the site immediately or within a few seconds.  I plan to link externally from here to my ISP webspace for various other things. I dunno. Silly_Walk has offered me webspace so I might just take it. We'll see how this goes first.
