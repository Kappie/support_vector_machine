I'll head out in a bit to take care of that and then I need to pick up a belated birthday present for my friend Jen. Her birthday was the other day and I havent had a chance to get her anything. I feel like such an ass, as I consider her to be a really good friend.  After all that I might be meeting someone new. This girl, Patti, that I met through my other blog at LiveJournal.com. She seems like a cool and interesting person, so I am looking foward to meeting her.
