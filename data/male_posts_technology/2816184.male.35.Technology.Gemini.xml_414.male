And now I'm stuck with this whole lost opportunites thing.  I really feel like things should've been different, like we missed out on something, something that would have been really wonderful.  It's depressing.  I then spent the trip back to the office with a driver talking about his dead father....wonderful.  That just made the afternoon.....
