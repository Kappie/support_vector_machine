See I have no cable and he has graciously let me watch a couple of hockey games at his house this week.  It's always fun hangin' out with Scott and his family.  There is never a dull moment at their house.  Here is the best part of all though...  Katie's cooking!!!  Last night she made barbecue chicken on the grill and it was amazing.  I am not a huge fan of chicken breast because it tends to get dry, but not Katie's chicken.  It was moist and delicious.  I got to give a big shout of props out to Katie today.  Every time we have a get together at Scott's house she seems to magically put together a great tasting meal.  In fact that seems to be the only time I ever get a home-cooked meal.  Other than that I am a fast-food junkie.  Believe me when I say I would have a Katie cooked meal over fast food anytime.  Anyways, thanks for every single meal you have ever cooked for me.  I truly appreciate it.  On a side note...  I got food poisoning from a pizza I ordered from Dominos a couple of weeks ago.  Just one more reason that I would rather have Katie's cooking.
