What if was from a different planet who has come to earth on a school assignment, the topic being "Why human beings are human beings and not any other species"?   I witnessed a lot of human beings in the market, some buying, some bargaining, some fighting, some happy, some dissatisfied. Why am I a human being and why should I walk through the streets experimenting people, Why should I have the ability to talk and think more than the other species. Out of the 1,84,000 (maybe more) different species in planet earth why am I chosen to be born as a human. Why are you chosen and why are you reading this?   These are some of the questions that raise through my so called brain. There must be some reason behind this. There is a higher being above us who constantly takes care of creation and the super infinite being is responsible for selecting me as a human. Why? Because I am the ONE...the chosen ONE.   We are all the chosen one. Each one is embedded with different characteristics, skills, mindset and body. We are born in this earth to do something. To help our fellow beings in some way. We are not here to waste our time. Human species is a wonderful creation and GOD takes pride in it. So GOD selects a particular soul to be a human only if one has the right privileges. One must have done something super good in the past lives as other creatures. Being a human is a reward in itself. Being a healthy human is an added advantage.   We are all sent to earth, each with a different purpose. Each one's destiny is already charted out. Its only that when if we achieve something, we feel great that we have changed destiny. Its a simulation that GOD provides. If you don't choose to take the path of what destiny has provided that itself is your destiny. Each one contributes to the society in some way. Some are doctors, engineers, industrialist, sports person, movie star, Law breakers, Law enforcers and the list goes on. When you take you and your profession, you are also contributing to one unit to build the future. But there must be a balance in this. What happens if world is only full of engineers, there is nobody to save precious lives. What happens when the world is full of Law Enforcers, there would be no theft, no job for the Law enforcers and eventually no news and no Information. Everything would seem stolid.   So think, ponder, comprehend, contemplate that what you are doing currently is in some way going to affect the future. You are doing your bit to help GOD maintain the balance. Whatever you need to do your work correctly, GOD provides you. It may seem that you are tried and tested with many challenges in Life, but that is only to make you more experienced and more dedicated to the work you do, so that you can contribute that one bit extra to humankind for taking us more near to the future. Such people turn out to be architects, scientists, innovative thinkers and world leaders. They are a kind on its own. Not anybody can be a president. There can be only one of a kind people like these. There can be only one Eistein, one Teresa, one Lincoln, one Galileo and the list never ends.   You can also be in the list of extra contributors in the future, who knows?    So what I am saying is, since we are all human beings and have the special privilege to help our fellow human beings and other living beings we should be more responsible for what we are thinking, doing or saying in order to contribute to the society. I am not trying to tell you that you should be a world contributor, just be a contributor to your nearest society and your nearest beings and contribute to humankind how much little you can.   If everybody does that little to the world then we would have a great place to live and a better tomorrow.     So what are you doing sitting there, go out there and do something ;-)
