I have seen people, especially in these recent, tiresome months, who have forgotten their commitment.  You cannot make a promise, whether it is spoken or not, and then forget about it.  You must understand that your actions make statements, even when those statements are not what you want to say.  I myself regret terribly some of the things I did just a few months ago.  I had to go into my shell, take time for myself, and figure out what it was I was doing, and why I was doing it.  I did things that I should not have done, and now I'm faced with the idea of having to deal with those consequences, whatever they may end up being, for a very long time.  Especially for a guy who's driving force in life has been making up for bad things he's done before, this is the worst of the worst things to do.  Forgetting the 'why' and focusing only on the moment causes serious consequences.    Fortunately for me, they're consequences that aren't all-ecompassingly bad (and I realize that may not be a word, fuck you).  All I have to do is live with the decisions I've made, and hope I can do better next time.  I am at peace with the decisions I've made, even the bad ones.  It's why it's so frustrating seeing people, especially people who have worked their way into your life, make similar mistakes.  It's hard watching people do things, do things to you, that you know they're going to regret.  It hurts, and it also makes you angry.  There is an overlying ideal of "Right" in the world, and when someone tramples on your life, and when someone ignores the commitments they've made, they're ignoring "Right."  It makes you angry, and sad, and full of pity, when you see people ignore "Right" for the impulse.  It's why I always say, "I try to be a nicer person."    I just wish people knew how what they do affects everyone.  I wish people understood that they do not live in a shell, and that their actions affect everyone else, no matter how much they try to keep it from happening.  Just understand what your actions say, and don't act surprised when someone who 'takes things seriously' starts taking things seriously.    Oh, and last thing.  Assumption is the mother of all fuck-ups.  Don't assume I'm talking about one person in particular.  Don't assume I'm talking about one situation, odds are you don't even fucking know what it is.  It all goes back to the idea of caring about a person, not caring about what that person can give you.  Ask yourself, when was the last time I asked "How are you doing?" and actually cared about the answer?
