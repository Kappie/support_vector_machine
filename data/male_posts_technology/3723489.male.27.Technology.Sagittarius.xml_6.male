In particular the pre-release games I’ll shortly be loading onto machines.  Microsoft has really stepped to the plate for the summer tour.  Tomorrow I’ll be loading Jade Empire, Forsa, Sudeki and MechAssault Lone Wolf and Conker.  We had Sudeki out on the tour last year and it looked phenomenal then and at E3.  Lone Wolf also looks sweet.  I’m a huge Xbox Live fan and I can’t wait to start throttling unsuspecting Atlases.
