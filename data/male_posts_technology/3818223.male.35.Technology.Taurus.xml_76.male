A note today from editor Kenny Crist told me the summer issue of  urlLink Black Petals  is going to press and should be available soon. My (very) short story "A Brief Future of Television" will be featured. Yay me! It will be the first time a story of mine will be published in print instead of online.  urlLink Hadrosaur Tales  has accepted another story entitled "You, Robot" but it is not scheduled for publication until August, 2005.
