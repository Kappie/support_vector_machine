Come on... you can do better than that! The only two reasons I wanted to see it at all were:    I like  urlLink Chow-Yun Fat  as an actor (the Corruptor, the Replacement Killers, and Crouching Tiger)   The movie was partially filmed across the street from where I live    I remember one weekend last summer, I looked out my window and saw two helicopters hovering over the abandoned building across the street. One seemed to be firing thousands of rounds of ammunition, while the other was filming it. It took me all of 2 seconds to realize it was a movie being filmed, although I wonder how many people called 911 to report what they saw. I also saw them film the "satellite dish falling off the building" scene. That building has no satellite dishes, so the ones you see in the movie were put there just for filming.  Anyways, you can see most of my neighbourhood (the driving range at least) in the background during the helicopter scene. Even the movie's  urlLink trailer  has a nice glimpse of it. I'd buy the DVD just in the odd chance that my condo makes a cameo appearance in one or two frames. I also recognize other parts of Toronto, such as the Yonge-Bloor subway station (where the little girl's falls on the subway tracks), the some of the bank towers (TD and Scotia), the Toronto skyline, etc.  Scott
