       So I had a Tuna Salad Sandwitch for lunch. Just bread, lettuce, tuna and mayo and I accidentaly made it a little heavy on the mayo. I ate half first, and the second half about 20 minutes later. Eating in this manner, a little bit at a time, seems to help with my problem of bloating and belching. I suppose it isn't any less in total, just a lower level over a longer period of time. I'm going to top off this delicious meal with a Zantac and some more MMs. Yummy.
