I love talking to people about things, and I got so burned on talking to the same group that I actually logged onto EFnet and Dal net for a little bit, had some discussions about Go, and movies, and some math, after failing at helping someone with some partial differential equations(sorry observer)  I should probably give orkut a chance to work, and msg some locals some more. Get a few social calls setup. But I don't really want to. I like the people I know. They're just not available to me, or not feeling talkative lately.   Fun stuff.
