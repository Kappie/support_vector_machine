The time I have available to myself is something positive that has come out of this. I can go to lunch whenever I want and take as much time as I need. But how do you weigh that against the work you're expected to do?   My previous job required that I would handle 1,642 pieces of paper each and every day. While the job does put your multi-tasking abilities to extreme practice, I view the job as a converter of such things. We convert most requests into physical products through monetary displacement. Cost centers, project codes, category codes, federal tax IDs, vendor specific payments percentages, split purchase orders through cost center and/or project code, invoice processing, amortization of invoice/purchase orders, rushing requisition/purchase orders through the system with no justification, the wait for managers/requestors to reply to their emails concerning their request and/or approval to process both requisition and purchase order, printing requisitions, po approvals, going down to purchasing and picking up purchase orders signed by a purchasing agent, scanning said purchase orders and associating them with referenced requisitions, contract scanning and synchronization with manager/vendor for signatures agreeing to contracts for maintenance/software/hardware/leasing etc, organization of said requistions, purchase orders, PO approvals, category manager/cost center proxy approvals, invoices, contracts, maintenance agreements for both software and hardware, contractor invoices and insurance contracts for their work to be processed, meetings with managers for them complain how the process is too slow and should be easier (all they can do is talk, it's what their good at), organization and live/real-time inventory count of all spare hardware/software and a running count of those borrowed and/or deployed permanently to specific users, salvage old equipment every month, keeping the basement organization within fire code, physically receiving shipments, physically retrieving desktop hardware and accessories, along with all this, keep up to date records of all transactions of the group (be it purchasing, invoice payment, deployed equipment, etc).  This...all of this...is what I've been temporarily charged with. Along with answering the inane and ignorant banter of our Harvard graduated user population for three hours every day, the rest of it is consumed with the above. 3 seconds is 30 minutes for me in this situation. I have no time to breath, no time to think, no time to do anything but the above. Along with the three hour helpdesk and 5 hour asset management support, I still have to administer to the CSC website and Support Magic (our ticketing system) plus train the rest of the helpdesk in the use of the new Blackberry system. I'm also assuming I have to organize/create training documentation for the one idiot that does not understand nor comprehend a device such as the blackberry because either a). he's lazy to learn about it, or b). doesn't care cause he cannot believe he has to learn about this! *enter sarcasm* Wow, isn't it enough that we have to memorize complex password change procedures!? *sarcasm leaves*  I think I'm too tired/exhausted to be angry. I don't think it makes sense to get angry anymore at these things. There's really nothing I can do and if I do say something...it'll reflect negatively on me (especially when review time comes around).  *sigh* My only solace is Liz-Ann and when I go home. Maybe now you know why I play games so much. Escapist tendencies galore.
