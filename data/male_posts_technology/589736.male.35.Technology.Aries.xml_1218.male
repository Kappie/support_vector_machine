All politicians create a reality for us -- a necessity for all leaders, the fictionalizing of the public self -- and any thinking person can easily see through the smoke.  However, it disturbs me when the smoke is this obvious -- not because it reflects badly on the politician (who is doing what all leaders must do), but because it reveals an alarming assumption of the simple-mindedness of the public.  If the article is factual on this point, I would have preferred if Bush had said he heard about it through an aide, or that it was confusing and no one clearly knew what was going on, than to create a story about watching it on television.  If true, it is a silly and unnecessary lie.  Beyond that one point, the rest of the article kind of rolled over me as a sea of timestamps and vague outrage.  Conspiracy?  No.  Confused and silly humans?  Sure.  Unnecessary fictionalizing?  You bet.
