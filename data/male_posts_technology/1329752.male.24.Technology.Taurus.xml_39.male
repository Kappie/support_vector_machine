"no matter what i say or do, i always end up thinking about you still."   break;  --- i just finished talking with teejz. i was about to read a message in my fone and he called. he's in the hospital, doing his slides for the presentation with his lappy. umm'... he's confined there. i'm not sure if i heard it right on him but i think it's because of his heart problem. we talked about the seminar that we will be conducting this saturday at a government school in manila. it will be a real fun since the 2 or 4 of us rather will be there. well i told him to stop doing it for a while and to get some rest. ---  teejz, u take care pare.  let's get back to where i stopped awhile ago:   "no matter what i say or do, i always end up thinking about you still."   you have already gained control of my weakness. it's my feelings. and in times when you seems not to care, the pain strikes deep down my heart. sobra. i learned so many things from you, perhaps the best lesson you had taught me was to be strong. no matter what i say or do, i always end up thinking about you still. for me you will always be the best. =) alam mo naman yun eh. there are times when i really hate you for being so cruel. that's ok. my mind says it was intentional, my heart says you're just too insensitive. for me it doesn't matter wether it is intentional or insensitive. as long as you are there, i can conquer everything, i can conquer my sadness. nobody can replace the happiness you brought inside my heart. =) i'm not hoping that someday we'll have a chance to know each other better. God is good, i know it would come our way. i thought you would hold on until the day we meet... i guess i'm wrong. now, the only way to be with you is in my dreams wherein such, no reason is necessary. i miss you my friend. i miss you so much... tke cre.  -----
