The answers for most of these questions will be hidden in some clues depending on the path we have chosen in life. But I have some questions the answers for which don't have the slightest clue and I feel I will never get the answers for them.   Just think why is there something as a universe? why are we on this earth and why earth in particular? What is the motive of live? Why should we exist? Why should all the creatures evolve? Why should there be a concept of "survival of the fittest"? Why should there be a concept called time? Why should the universe expand? Why should we struggle to make our lives comfortable? Why should we eat to survive? If materialistic desires bring suffering why should we all have materialistic desires in the first place? Is this somekind of dream we all are having and are we going awakr from this dream? if we are dreaming where are we actually and why are we there all? Why is there a concept of fear? Is courage nothing but the fine concealment of fear? Why is everything getting so complicated around us? Why are there different blood groups among us? Why are there 5 senses and "navarasas"?    There are some more questions which I cannot put into words. But I am getting a very strange feeling and sense of uneasyness as I am writing this. If any of you can answer this please help me.   As usual I thank you for your patience and please feel free to comment.
