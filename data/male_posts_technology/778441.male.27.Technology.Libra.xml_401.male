This is just days after Dr. AQ Khan, the father of Pakistan's nuclear bomb admitted to selling nuclear secrets to countries like Iran, Libya and North Korea. With at least four other scientists involved with him in this sharing of nuclear technology to known rogue nations, it is difficult to believe that they all acted on their own without some sort of collusion with the government or its agencies. Its difficult to believe this because...   No questions were asked about Khan's lifestyle, his frequent trips abroad -- always first class -- and his lengthy periods of residence under an assumed name at some of the world's most expensive hotels.  Successive heads of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence ignored allegations of financial impropriety until 1990, when Lieutenant General Shamshur Rahman Kallu prepared a report for the attention of the then prime minister Benazir Bhutto.  The report gathered dust until fresh investigations were ordered on the instructions of ISI chief Lieutenant General Mahmoud Ahmad, who handed his findings over to Musharraf in 2001.    [taken from a  urlLink Rediff report ]   Moreover, with General Aslam Beg  urlLink alleging  that Pervez Musharraf has been actively involved in nuclear proliferation and with Benazir Bhutto and Shehbaz Sharif (Nawaz Sharif's brother) planning to send a joint application to the International Court of Justice to try Musharraf for spreading nuclear weapons, it's too damned difficult to digest this latest US posture!  Ohh... but I'm sure that it has got absolutely nothing to do with the fact that the US is planning  urlLink an anti-Osama offensive inside Pakistan  which would entail getting in the good books of Pakistan ( which would, otherwise, never allow an US action on Pakistani soil )
