The new(old) java 1.4.2 regex utilities are the way to go, and you probably could write a pretty simple browser in a couple of days or so.  Here is a simple regex expression that works pretty well(uses grouping) :  The first group includes the anchor tag and the text, The second group includes the text inside the anchor tag  Pattern p = Pattern.compile("({a.*?href=.*?}(.*?){/a})"); Matcher m = p.matcher(some_url_page);  while(m.find()) {      int n = m.groupCount();    ....   }
