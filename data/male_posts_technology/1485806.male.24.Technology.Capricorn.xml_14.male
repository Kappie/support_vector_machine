Saw quite a lot of people back here in Malaysia ...i mean came back from Oz and i am suprised at the number of people staying back in Help cause got unsettled subjects and which means ....the graduation tak syok cause the people i went  to graduate seminar is not there with me....  Oh well not many of them anyway are looking for jobs ...not to say it sarcastically ...looking for jobs ain't so fun..it is like waiting for results for exam except that u will never know when is it coming...gotta live on faith and on God.  Interview is like an assignment that is gonna decide whether you go on in life or not and there is this major revision and research to prepare for it. And u know   Gotta pray for this ....
