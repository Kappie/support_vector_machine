But seriously..) sometimes I realise what a shitty excuse for life the human race can be sometimes.. We like to fool ourselves with our illusions about how wonderfull humanity is.. We created Art and Music... Civilisation and social intercourse (hehe.. he said intercourse..) yet we forget the mistakes of our past..  How many of you identify with the Nazi's who sectioned of the jews and homosexuals and then when everyone in the country had forgotten them the quietly killed them off and burnt them?  Or maybe you want to remember you are part of the same species that killed HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of people in Rwanda?  What about the species that goes to war on the basis of looking for weapons of mass destruction when what you really want to do is leverage your power base in the international arena (oh yeah, and secure the oil sources for the next few decades even though you know that all you are doing is working for the oil companies in the knowledge that in 50 years or so there will be no oil left but by then it'll be someone elses problem)  Think about it because this is you.. The problem with people is that they think that civilisation is an individual thing and just because someone else did it as long as you don't do it then things will be ok.. That just isn't enough..  Civilisation is a beast unto itself.. And until people actively try to make things better then that chances are it will just get worse..  That's my .02 cents on that for the moment..  On the plus side.. My plan for the night (after I got ditched by the boys..) was to sit at home and get drunk and depressed.. I know that sounds strange but I actually look forward to it.. I find it refreshing to spend a night drinking whatever I can get my hands on and then spend the night getting emotional and crying to myself.. It exorcises the demons I don't even know are there and it has been so long since my last drunk and depressed night that I can't even remember the details of what depressed me last time..  So here I am sitting at home drunk and writing on my blog..  Wanna know what I a depressed about??  You know you do :)  Have I gotten you all worked up about it yet??  I'll tell you if you promise to keep it to yourself..  I have your word?  The answer is....  Nothing.. I feel a slight sensation of melancholie but I know what that is about and it ain't the all consuming depresion I look forward to normally..  How depressing is that eh??  Oh well.. I guess next time I'll have to work harder.. Drink more faster and the like eh?  So.. Have I got anything else to add to this farcicle blog?  Nope.. I think I'll just have to go to bed before I "Defenstrate" my laptop.. (Have YOU been paying attention to my recent blogs?? ;))  Good Night,  Good Fight.
