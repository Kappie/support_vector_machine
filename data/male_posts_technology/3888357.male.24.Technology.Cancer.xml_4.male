I say this because there's this quaint little French patisserie around the corner from my current job (current for only 1.48 more hours I must say) called Les Papillon (or The Butterfly for everyone that, as I did, would have to look it up on  urlLink Babelfish ) that makes the most fantastic almond croissants-fresh, flakey little fattening layers with the most delicate, butter-coloured almond cream paste filling. They're magic... I'll probably miss having the Papillon in the vicinity more than anything...That's not really true...the team here at  urlLink IBC  is pretty cool all in all.  Jace is on a pub crawl tonight with his mate Beamo-it's his 24th birthday. I will probably catch up later, just in time to carry him home. Until then, I'm surfing  urlLink Jamie Oliver's blog , eating a Kit Kat and counting the hours. For a bit of fun though for you as well, check out the " urlLink This Land " cartoon from JibJab.
