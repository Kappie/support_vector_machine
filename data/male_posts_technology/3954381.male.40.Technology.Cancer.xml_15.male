The semi-autobiographical storyline is about an actress fresh out of rehab trying to get her life back on track by jumping into a new film, hoping it will ground her and get her through some unsteady times. On her second day of filming as she is walking to and from the set she is approached by numerous studio execs who are gently criticizing her already fragile ego as they have just seen the dailies and don't feel she is giving her best. Along the way she meets one of the producers, played by Rob Reiner*, who tells her that it's a comedy rule to punch up the joke by raising the pitch of your voice on the last word of the line. So she responds by deadpanning "That's a comedy   rule  ?" Funny and subtle, it plays nicely on screen. On paper it's not funny, it's just sounds stupid.  I mention this because very often I am mis-read in my writing in chats or emails. I think I am coming across as too abrasive, obnoxious, sarcastic and not very nice. Words are powerful tools, there's no debating this. My mind sometimes works at a feverish pace always trying to think of witty things to say. But what I neglect to think about is how I am being interpreted. You can only type so many inflections in an email or chat, and it's far too easy to read emotion, or in my case, the wrong emotion into what is being written.  It would be easy for me to say that the people who are misreading me are idiots, of course, that also wouldn't be very nice. So rather than be stubborn and and bullheaded I think I would like to accept accountability on this issue and proclaim my intent to know my audience and write to their level of comprehension. That sounds far more arrogant then I intended it to, but essentially it's what I need to do. Perhaps I can just incorporate this into the whole "Re-Invention" plan, why not attempt to improve my social  writing skills along with my physical being.....well I can and will make the attempt. That's all I can do, if I don't succeed immediately; I know I will eventually. I just hope I don't drive more people away (well   some   of them can go away, that wouldn't be the end of the world) ; but certainly not the ones who matter.  On a related sidenote,  Postcards from the Edge  is a solid 4 star movie. Directed by Mike Nichols with a powerhouse cast including the aforementioned Meryl Streep, Shirley MacLaine, Gene Hackman, Dennis Quaid, Rob Reiner, Oliver Platt, Mary Wickes, Conrad Bain, Annette Bening and Richard Dreyfuss; it's a very funny movie that could have been very unfunny. Suicide, drug overdose, parental abuse and career woes wouldn't, on the surface, seem to be the stuff great comedy is made from but with this cast and Nichols assured direction.....it is. If that weren't enough, for a non-musical,  Postcards from the Edge  features not one, but two show stopping musical numbers. One of which is a slightly re-written (by the composer himself) version of Stephen Sondheim's "I'm Still Here", originally written for his 1973 show "Follies". If you've been keeping tabs on this blog, not that I think anyone is particularly interested, you'd know that I am, if nothing else, a huge fan of Stephen Sondheim. If you've never seen it, you could do far worse then checking out  Postcards from the Edge . If you have seen it, see it again; it's worth multiple viewing.    *Can't be 100% sure it was Rob Reiner at this point, it could have been Oliver Platt.
