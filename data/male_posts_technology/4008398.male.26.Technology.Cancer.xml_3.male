    
       I am a software engineer by profession and was born and brought up in New Delhi, India.   My field of expertise lies in .Net, C#, Commerce Server, ASP.Net and stuff.   I work for Infosys Technologies Ltd. and right now I am onsite at the client location just finishing on to one of the most hectic projects I have been involved with.   In my free time I like exploring things like VS.Net Add-Ins, Custom Utilities in .Net and Linux stuff.   Right now I am working on three part time projects    Organizer  Orderform Viewer  Issue Tracker in Infopath   "   Organizer   " is coded in .Net which will support multiple data sources like SQL Server, XML, Oracle, Access  probably MySQL. It will have modules like Contacts Management, Budget Management, Events and Reminders using .Net Event Notification System.   Also I am planning to have exporting features in to excel, word and outlook formats. The data model and screen design are complete and probably I will post it here pretty soon.   "  OrderForm Viewer  "  is a custom tool to explode the marshalled data in the Commerce Server transaction databases. This is almost done and I am getting the data in XML now. I just need to format it using the XSL. I am working on the XSL part now.  "   Issue Tracker   " is used to sync up the Issues so that multiple people can work on it in offline mode. It will two parts i.e. Infopath Issue Tracker form which is used as the data entry form. There will be a button at the bottom which is either going to send an email to other team mates and also optionally save in the local database so that it can be managed properly.  Second part is the searching and managing application which is going to look up on to the database for faster searches. Again the goal is to support multiple types of databases here.  Well, I guess that is it to start with. I will keep updating this with the latest activities that I am going on with.     Neeraj Sharma      urlLink  neerajsharma@rediffmail.com
