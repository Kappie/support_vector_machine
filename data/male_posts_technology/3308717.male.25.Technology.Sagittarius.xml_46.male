Well, that is, if I have not already experienced it. I don't know if it is a gift or a curse. People tell me constantly that I anticipate their thoughts and I do admit to that. At the same time I seem to be, as one would describe, an absentminded professor.  I think back on my life in a sort of fast-forward review of events leading me to my present position in the space-time continuum. I am happy about one thing over everything else. I have given myself to experience. I try not to take someones word on things, be it good or bad. I've hurt myself plenty of times. I've even hurt others, and by hurt I mean physically and/or emptionally. I don't appologize for any of it, it's life. That has lead me to conclude that life is meant to be lived, lived with no regrets. Obviously you need to moderate your activities and minimize negative influences on others, but often that cannot be avoided.   This brings up another thought. People, in general, appologize for far too many things. At times they appologize for events that are well out of their control. We also tend to over-use other words and phrases, such as 'love' and 'hate'. I am not saying I am innocent of this, but I do try to watch my careless usage of such words. I admit, however, that it is hard in fits of excitement to check every word. Once I began thinking about this subject years ago I started noticing more and more people using these words in completely wrong contexts. Then again, who am I to say what is right or wrong, such things are subjective.  I recently read an inteview with Maynard from Tool, one metaphore he used to describe knowledge and information is this:   "If you look at the cycles of the moon, it starts as a thin crescent and then gradually waxes until it becomes full; then it gradually wanes back into another crescent and then it is gone. The moon reflects sunlight like humans reflect information. We wax and wane and when we become full moons, our egos are full.   I think he hit it dead on. We should not take credit for information. The information was always there, we didn't create it. However, interpretation is something to be proud of. Sharing knowledge I learn with others is one thing that really makes me happy. To inform someone of something they did not know before. Sometimes I think I should be a teacher or a historian. I very much enjoy ancient history and learning of cultures that were pondering the same questions we have still today.  I've recently been thinking about looking for a new female companion. The last two times I ventured this i got burned. Maybe I'll just poke my head out of the treeline and see how things are going out there these days. It's not insecurity, nor is it fear. Some might call it hesitation, but I don't think that would fit either, if anything I am not hesitant (for the most part) in fact most of the time I am quite the opposite - "shoot first ask questions later", "going both feet in", etc. Maybe I would call it, cautious I guess. Yes, that works.  Anyhoo, I'm pretty much done rambling. Mynext post, I promise, will be something back in line with the standard dork-factor, which is normally present here.   -intX    what, me wory?
