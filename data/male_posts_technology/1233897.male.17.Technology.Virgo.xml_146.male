Nina Gordon - Tonight and the rest of my life   Down to the earth I fell with dripping wings Heavy things won’t fly And the sky might catch on fire And burn the axis of the world that’s why I prefer a sunless sky To the glittering and stinging in my eyes  And I feel so light This is all i want to feel tonight And I feel so light Tonight and the rest of my life  Gleaming in the dark sea I’m as light as air floating there breathlessly When the dream dissolves I open up my eyes I realize that Everything is shoreless sea A weightlessness is passing over me  And I feel so light This is all i want to feel tonight And I feel so light Tonight and the rest of my life Tonight and the rest of my life And I  Everything is waves and stars The universe is resting in my arms  I feel so light This is all i want to feel tonight I feel so light Tonight and the rest of my life And I feel so light This is all i want to feel tonight And I feel so light Tonight and the rest of my life Tonight and the rest of my life   I'm going to sleep to this song tonight. :)
