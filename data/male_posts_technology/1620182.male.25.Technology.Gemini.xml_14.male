 But let's not dwell on that fact.  Wednesday is Saturday and I'll be in Hilton Head, South Carolina splashing around and trying to even out this horrid farmer's tan that's left over from fishing last weekend.  Beaches tend to make all your problems melt away if you'll let them, and I'm more than willing right now.
 
 I've spent the past month trying to rid myself of one problem in particular: the fact that I drive down to Virginia at least twice a month.  I've estimated that I spend approximately $5000 a year traveling between here and VA.  So, considering that my family and my girlfriend are in Virginia, and the fact that my company has an office there, I put in for a transfer.
 
 My boss has been pretty understanding.  I really don't think he wants me to go.  He's tried in several subtle ways to convince me that I want to stay in NY.  I've been steadfast though, so he's tried to help me get approval to move.  Unfortunately, the approval process passes over the desk of my boss' boss, which is not a good thing.  He seems intent on stopping any type of request, whether it be for a laptop battery or for a move, and I don't expect this request to proceed any differently.
 
 I threw myself into the move yesterday, though.  I moved the majority of my "stuff" down to VA last night.  I DO NOT want to EVER do that again (if I can help it).  Moving sucks -- thoroughly.  I kept my essentials up in a room that I'm renting in NY, but I anticipate moving to VA as soon as possible.  When will that be though?
 
 The majority of my stress aside, I have two days of working out of the Herndon, Va office.  I'm heading to the beach the day after tomorrow and then it's back for the UVA versus DOOK game on Saturday night in Charlottesville (I got season tickets).  It's a packed schedule, but I think it'll be worth it.
