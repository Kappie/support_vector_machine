I just don't think I'm getting any starting cards and now when I do I'm either already so far behind that no one is bothered by my play or they come over the top with little or no fear.  I think I may be a bit to patient and may try opening up a bit to see what happens.  I just hate changing things when I don't have a lot of bankroll room to absorb things if it doesn't work out.    Guess I'll just give it some thought and see how things go.  Until next time.....
