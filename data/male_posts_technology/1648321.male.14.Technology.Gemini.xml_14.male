I scored a cool goal along with a lot of other awesome shots. We really beat them 6-0, but about half a second before the ref blew the whistle, Ryan scored a goal. (But then the ref said that he blew the whistle before the goal.) Last time we played this team we beat them 12-1. Haha! ;-) Piano was boring (as usual). But the whole family and Emi and her friend, Katie all went to izzy's ice cream! I did HMK when we got home and I had to read this stupid "CLASSIC" book until after 10:00 pm. Well today is a B day, so I hope it is good! :-)
