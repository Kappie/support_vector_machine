Rostrum in front of the cameras and millions of people.. Getting your Oscar or Grammy or whatever it is.. I would love to be in such a situation. So i've prepared a speech and it goes something like that. By the way, i'd prefer winning the  Best Actor Oscar .   "Oh my god... Thank you all..Thank you very much..Mmmmmm.. I'm very excited.. My hormones are just too way out of control to be dealing with this..I've written a speech some 3 years ago when i was first nominated for this category, and i'm dying to read it so...I want to first thank god and my family. I want to thank Steven Spielberg for believing in me and giving me the opportunity and the honor to be a part of this respected prestigious academy... A special thank to the staff and my agent..By the way, George Bush is a FAG. I also want to dedicate this award to the people raising their voices in favour of peace and international legality.. My experiences of making this film made me very aware of the sadness and the dehumanisation of people at times of war..  Thank you all for this, thank you America, thank you Palestine. I love you."  Stupid but worth trying.
