In the first few years of living in this area I experienced new things and learned a lot about the streets while never actually getting involved with the wrong crowds or doing drugs. One of the things that gives the area I reside in a really bad rep is that it is known for is the poor people and crack addicts but sometimes the crack addicts can seem humorous because they do what I call "the chicken dance" where their brain makes their body tweak out and have no control over their body for a short period of time. They also cross streets without looking which makes some drivers quite angry, yell at anonymous people for staring, smell really bad, urinate on public buildings out in the open, cause public mischief, and pretty much bring down the property value of everything around them therefore making them a threat to society.      The sad thing is these people, many of them came from good family's and some from bad ones but were neglected or just got in with the wrong crowd and it just went all downhill from there for them I suppose.      Although the city of Surrey has been enforcing the RCMP on these people with their patty wagons I always see when walking back and forth to school I sure do hope that they are not just locking them up to teach them a lesson because that wont do anything, they will be back on the streets in no time.      We need to help them get away from drug addiction and to just start their life all over again and maybe even use their past experiences to help out others in the past position.      If you think it is not worth our tax payers money to help these people, think of all the money that goes to basic healthcare needs for these addicts who are constantly overdosing and damaging their body's, causing pain and stress for family members, and always requiring special services such as welfare, needing food from the food bank and the way they drag down tourism, property value, and take up the RCMP's time for nothing when they could be educated and working to contribute to a greater cause, that being Canada.  **Anyways I hope you found that big mess of paragraphs enlightening, I am going to the gym now and hopefully my shoulder heals cause I guess I have irritated it a lot and I am still looking for a job so I'm going to try my luck handing out resumes in the industrial parts of surrey and I will update my blog again tomorrow if I am not too tired.
