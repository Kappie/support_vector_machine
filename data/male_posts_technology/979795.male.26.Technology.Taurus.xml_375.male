I thought everything seemed really well arranged for the day even though it was more or less impromptu. Lucky Richard was quite soft, and I managed some of the more decent ukemi for him. Syed again went throught his 'Seagal-like' randori and techniques. 'Eastern Seagal' was the term used hahaha. Thought the weather wasn't exactly forgiving, I thought the atmosphere was generally pretty relaxed during training.  Today's was conducted by Sensei himself and Alvin came down as well. More senior students turned up here and I really wanted to concentrate more on training instead. Sunny was around, and of course I didn't dare commit myself to most of his techniques. But that's no reason to stop nor, hope someday I can take more decent ukemi and his techniques.  Overall, I enjoyed yesterday's exhibition a bit more. Can't explain it, it just felt more like the usual class I'm accustomed to. Today, well I got the feeling that we were a lot more conscious of this as an exhibition than went through it like a normal class. Again, it was seriously warm and even Alvin didn't seem like his usual self. He looked like he was sweating a lot more than usual. Syed dropped by but didn't join the mat.'  Didn't manage to stay all the way to help with the mats coz Tang was waiting for me. After that, told Sensei sorry I couldn't stay (coz we loaned the mats to a Hanmudo exhibition after us and could only keep mats after them) and went to Bedok with Tang. We grabbed a bite there and talked for hours over Aikido. Dunnoz lah, we tend to discuss things like that. One thing about Tang is that he's as real on the mat as he is off the mat. So I learn a lot of things from him in terms of attitude and all that.  Anyway, can't wait to go back to regular training class soon. I've even planned to train up to 5 days a week when my parents go off to China at the end of the month for a holiday. Which reminds me, I better schedule my leave early to let my HoD approve soo it won't interfere with work then.
