She is very timid, refuses to take the right-of-way in the hallway or at the coffee pot, and is afraid of computers in general.  She is our bookeeper, and steadfastly chooses to keep hand-written ledgers to duplicate the work that the expensive accounting program does.  She doesn't trust the software, and keeps records to "check" the software.    She drives a small Honda Civic, ordinarily a nice little car, although it is funny for a 60+ yr old woman to have a "sporty" car.  Anyway, the car has stupid headrests.  I have become unnaturally obsessed with these stupid headrests.  They have posts on the side, rather than the center. I don't know how to describe them other than stupic.  They are aesthetically offensive.  They were probably designed by the ultra-conservative right-wing, or maybe the liberal media, or maybe the miltary-industrial complex, or maybe Osama.  They are just really STUPID headrests, and I wish I could rip them out of every Civic in the world and bring them to the Japanese designer's desk and stomp on it in front of him, shouting "DON'T YOU SEE HOW STUPID THESE ARE?????"  I am amazed at how much time I have devoted to denigrating the headrests on a car.  Konichiwa.
