Anyway, corruption is very much prevalent in India and it is clearly shown in the UNHDP report which positions India at a low 127th position in Human Development Index.   But have we ever considered why is corruption there and why should it be considered bad/wrong? I will try and justify corruption. Let us have a view point from the persons taking bribes.    Everyone (well most of us) of us feels that we deserve to be paid more for the work we do and so do the government officials. In our case we talk to our higher ups and eventually get a hike (and one we are happy with), but it is not that easy in the case of govt. officials. Therefore, they directly ask the public and get more remuneration. It is a form of commission to them for the services they have rendered. So what is wrong in this? Therefore, their way is also right.   But there are other short commings with the officials which I am obviously not going to discuss atleast in this article.   As usual, thanks for your time and please do comment.  PS - Article written just for the sake of writing and this pro-corruption stand is just to break the monotony of the anti-corruption propaganda.
