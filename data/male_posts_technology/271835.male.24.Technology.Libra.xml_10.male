With no warning at all, they have stopped all access to my site at bhell13.co.uk It seems I havnt paid my bill which used to be £26 a year, they didnt send me a warning that my account was about to expire or anything, and I cant renew my account cos they have stopped that deal. Its now £49 a year for a standard hosting account!!! So im looking for a new host, but im tempted to jack it all in and leave the internet alone...
