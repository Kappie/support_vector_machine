It was freezing, I didn't get enough sleep and on top of that I am in limbo with this chick that I really like (as cheesy as that sounds) but we won't get into that right now.  So I get up and proceed to do my morning rituals as fast as I can as to not be late for work.  Still got to work late.  GRRRRR  So I'm sure that you all have heard of "things happen for a reason"  A lot of things have happened over the last three weeks but I still haven't found out why they happened.  GRRRRR  Yeah doesn't make much sense.  I'm sure I'll get the hang of this sometime.  The Butterfly Effect looks like an interesting view.  Might not be good at all but the idea of "The Butterfly Effect" is still intriguing enough that I think I will pay the highway robbery fee of $9.00 and watch the movie anyways.  Atleast I get to go to North Beach (Downer's Grove, IL) tonight for a little fun and people watching.  Hopefully it will be a lot better than it has been over the past few weeks.  That's it for now.
