Its a pity that people are influenced by the senseless scribblings of a "White French man".. if I may call you that way sir.. his racist mentality is evident from the way the "colour of the skin" becomes the only theme in the article. More than politics or history his words are an offence over the skin of people.   I don't understand why the feeling that the image of India is "harmed" by images of our poor. USA has a significant population of "native americans" (or the so called "red indians"), who have been overthrown by the "white skinned" European settlers for their own selfish motives... The native Americans live in valleys and ridges and many unaware that there is another world and that there's something called technology... Are we Indians more selfish than such a ruthless American lot..??  Indians respect Mother Teresa not because she's white-skinned, not because there's no one else "brown-skinned" in India to take care of poor but because we respect every human and honour his/her good deeds irrespective of his/her skin color...   White people spend hours on the beach and put on a hundred creams to get tanned. And in winter they even artificially lie under infrared lamps in beauty parlors to get brown! Why this obsession for the Indian woman to have white skin?    I ask the same question to Mr.Gautier, why do your people want to become brown like us Indians... Isn't white beautiful enough for you..??? Why this obsession to become brown..??? You are that sect of perennially irrational ideologists for whom grass is always greener on your side...   Junk can never be junker than this...!!  ---------  The fact that an opinion has been widely held, is no evidence that it is not utterly absurd; indeed in view of the silliness of the majority of mankind, a widespread belief is more likely to be foolish than sensible.   - Bertrand Russell, Marriage and Morals (1929) ch. 5
