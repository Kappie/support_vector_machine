She was nice enough to accept the blame and make up a story about self-defense, but to return the favour I had to rig the 2000 elections.  I was responsible for all those hanging chads, I ran the remote which controlled Katherin Harris, and I bribed the U.S. Supreme court with crack.  Justice Scalia sure loves the rock.  Anyway, now that I've got that off my chest, I should just point out how disgusted I am with all the blunt-smoking here at Autumn Lane.  I read in Collier's magazine that if a person smokes 3 blunts a day for a year, their lungs will have enough resin to smoke up the entire audience at a Britney Spears concert.  And it would be the best Britney Spears concert ever.  So I think it's obvious we all need to start smoking more blunts.  Britney does MANY concerts and those 12-year-old girls aren't going to have such small tolerances forever.  Who's with me?
