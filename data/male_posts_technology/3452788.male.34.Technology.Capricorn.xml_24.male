Instead of wearing her out with my endless blathering, I will subject you to my random thoughts instead.  Fern Canyon is an actual place here in Humboldt County, CA, maybe you've seen it in the movies.  My Fern Canyon is in the recesses of my brain, a dark, damp, intensely green and fertile place where I am not afraid to share my thoughts and not constrained by what everyone else needs me to be.  Sometimes I am funny, often depressed, sometimes exasperated, seldom truly happy, usually cynical, frequently amazed, but always willing to be honest and shine the light on the dark corners of my brain to examine the skeletons therein.  If you are still here, thanks for paying attention.  Isn't that what we all want, someone to notice us?  Please drop me a comment or a personal e-mail if you like.  I'm interested in what others think about my rantings.
