Some bookmark links, when clicked, modify the current zoom settings, e.g. put you in 100% or worse, in 200%. To modify this annoyance you can directly modify the PDF document in your Text editor.  With  urlLink UltraEdit , for example, I load the PDF document and open the "Search and Replace" box, enable "Regular Expressions" and replace all occurrences of  "R/XYZ*]"  with  "R/XYZ]" , and then also all occurrences of  "R/Fit*]"  with  "R/XYZ]" . Now safe the document.  With the  urlLink Perl  scripting language, this hack is applied with   perl -pe 's#R/(XYZ.*?|Fit.*?)\]#R/XYZ\]#g#' in.pdf out.pdf   The next time you open the modified document with Acrobat you will get a message that the document is being repaired. Just safe it again with Acrobat and everything is fine.  Close all Bookmark Folders (recursively, nested)  Unfortunately, PDF documents with a huge folder hierarchy of bookmarks have all folders opened. This creates a large list and I cannot find anything at glance. How can I close all folders, also the nested ones? To modify this annoyance you can directly modify the PDF document in your Text editor.  With  urlLink Search and Replace , for example, I specify the PDF document, enable "Regular Expressions" and replace all occurrences of  "\/Count +[0-9]\/Parent"  with  "/Count -%1/Parent" .  With Perl, this hack is applied with   perl -pe 's#/Count ([0-9]+)/Parent#/Count -$1/Parent#g#' in.pdf out.pdf   The next time you open the modified document with Acrobat you will get a message that the document is being repaired. Just safe it again with Acrobat and everything is fine.   Note : Always make a backup of your PDF document before modifying it, since sometimes the hacks just don't work and you end up with a document that Acrobat cannot repair.
