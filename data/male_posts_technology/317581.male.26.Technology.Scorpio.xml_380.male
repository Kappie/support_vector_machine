I think I figured out living arrangements for after june. Work is going good. Light house, my church thing on tuesdays is great.  Umm... I saw Adam on wednesday. That was fun. He lives in Tenino right now and so he's a lot closer than home.  Houck is up again this weekend. So he'll be stopping by around dinner time. YAY. The comic book thing last weekend was really good. If you go to my links for my other sites, you'll notice I discontinued service due to my lack of time to work on them.  Anyway, hope you all are doing good and I'll check yous latah- T
