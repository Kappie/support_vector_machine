This quote alone upset me the most  The bishop wrote that Catholics who vote contrary to church teaching "jeopardize their salvation."    To imply that a vote contrary to Church teaching could jeopardize one's salvation is spiritual abuse. As if the Church hasn't had enough problems on its own. I wonder if the Bishop's issued any such warnings to those clergy involved in sexual abuse of their parishioners?   urlLink The New York Times > National > Bishop Would Deny Rite for Defiant Catholic Voters
