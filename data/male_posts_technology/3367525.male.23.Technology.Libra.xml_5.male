We have such great aspirations for you.  Sports, sciences, computers, so  much to experience.  The days are passing quickly.  A few of our classes have been canceled so we are searching for others so we are not so unprepared for the day you arrive.  We wil be ready, one way or another.  I love you Tristan.  Your father,  Ariston
