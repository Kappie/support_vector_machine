It wasn't that i did not like the initial first few pages but just another item in my life that i forgot about at the time. I bought an old hardbound from a goodwill store that included Terminal man and Great Train Robbery as well in it. The font type is very old and nothing like his newer books such as Prey which imho was complete and utter trash. Great Train Robbery for some reason reminds me of mustard stains! eh Alex?  What comes to mind when you hear the book " great train robbery " to you? haha . In any case the book is exactly like it should be with a chrichton novel. It's very detailed in military and medical terms. I'm on page 200 right now so I should be done by tomorrow.   rob
