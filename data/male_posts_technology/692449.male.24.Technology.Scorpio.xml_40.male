Alice didn't dare to argue the point, but went on: `--and I thought I'd try and find my way to the top of that hill--'    `When you say "hill,"' the Queen interrupted, `_I_ could show you hills, in comparison with which you'd call that a valley.'    `No, I shouldn't,' said Alice, surprised into contradicting her at last:  `a hill CAN'T be a valley, you know.  That would be nonsense--'    The Red Queen shook her head, `You may call it "nonsense" if you like,' she said, `but I'VE heard nonsense, compared with which that would be as sensible as a dictionary!'"
