"  So awesome.  "The movie star-turned-politican used the term to describe opposition Democrats he said who are too weak to stand up to unions and trial lawyers demanding changes in the governor's state budget proposal. "  And he also said that if they did not approve his budget proposals it would be the "End of Days for them!" Also they would have a "Total Recall of the State's past budget problems."  I love the governator.  News Source  urlLink Voice of America News    Sorry about the rehashed jokes. They're still funny to me.
