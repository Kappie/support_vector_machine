I have had two instances where people needed to get in touch with me and the pager has failed.  The main problem is that the pager is connectionless communication.  Someone dails and number or sends an email, but they get zero confirmation that the page was actually received.  With a cell phone, you know if you get through instantaneously.  Pagers should be banned.
