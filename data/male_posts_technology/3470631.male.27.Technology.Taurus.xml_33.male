Everyone knows that feeling (well maybe not the lacrosse team who consistently was finger blasting quality poopoo.) But you get the point.   Well my good friend JJ has come up with the perfect remedy to this feeling. He has invented an imaginary younger brother to pass on all that Jay has learned. Genius. Here is the lesson for today:   "My advice to Todd is to go out every Friday and Saturday night at the least because you never know what's going to happen.  I've missed some great things on nights that I stayed home to get a little rest."   - JSR  That being said - everyone must go out tonight and party. It's finally feeling like summer for chrissakes so get out there and make something fucking happen. CHRIST.   You think Todd is staying in tonight?   Not a fucking chance.
