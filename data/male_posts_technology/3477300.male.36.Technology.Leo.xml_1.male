I didn't want to start again uptil I'd written my own blogging engine and hosted it on my own server (PLUG> http://sagar.org).  But then I realized it was way too nurdy and I don't have time for it.  Right, this is turning to drivel too.  I'll stop now until I've got time to write something meaningfull.    Just finally should say  WELCOME!
