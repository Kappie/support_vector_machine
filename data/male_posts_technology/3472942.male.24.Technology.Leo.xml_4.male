" t!ck: " *mumbles* yes pls "     she went up the bed, put one leg on my butt, the other on my upper back,and not thinking twice, step down on me, i went like *pssstttt* my lungs deflated, unable to pump back. holy cow, a release, then another step..      wah lan eh i tell u..  but after that was quite shiok cas she was really quited skilled, except the backstepping part.  you know the pole on the roof? you're supposed to hold on to  that and reduce the weight mah sister..   *grumble* *grumble*
