Yesterday I noticed that they changed their  urlLink website  and started to provide  urlLink links  to other services that they provide.  Most noticeable is  urlLink Froogle .  Froogle has been around for a little while now.  It's basically a shopping guide from Google.  It looks online for the cheapest prices for specific products that you search for.  I have no idea how this search works but if it's the same method that  urlLink Google  uses, then the prices that it comes up with will be from webpages that have a bunch of links (with the top search result being the one with the most links).   urlLink Yahoo  and  urlLink Google  used to be partners in the online world.  Google was the search engine and Yahoo providing content.  Yahoo got wind that Google was planning on becoming a content provider to challenge Yahoo for some of the money that is being thrown around out here in cyber space.  They plan to offer content and services similar to what Yahoo and MSN are offering.  Yahoo bought a couple of little search engines to bolster it's own web search engine.  This allows them time to fine tune their newly bought technology to be able to compete with Google.  MSN, on the other hand, just recently decided to do their own R for their own search engine.  This isn't really a surprise.  In terms of Web innovation, Microsoft has been always a little behind.  What Microsoft lacks in foresight it makes up for with resources.  It has billions of dollars along with it's manpower to be able to catch up in this search engine race, well it's not really a race, it's more of war.   urlLink Vivisimo  is another innovative search engine that groups together relative search results into "clusters"  For example, if you went to Google and did a search on  urlLink 'Paris Hilton'  you would most likely see results for the heir to the Hilton empire.  If you did a search on  urlLink 'Hilton Paris'  it would come up with the Hilton in Paris but still have some Paris Hilton results.  With  urlLink Vivisimo , you get everything in a nice organized cluster.  So if you were looking for the hotel, just go ahead and click on the 'Hotel' cluster and from there you can find everything from the official Hilton-Paris website to getting deals for the rooms at the hotel.  Now if you were actually looking for other risque 'Paris Hilton' related information, they too are also clustered neatly in this website.  With Google ripe for their IPO this year, it wouldn't surprise me if they actually try to buy out Vivisimo or develop something along the lines of clustering.  Microsoft would probably do something the same with all their money, who needs to innovate?  Yahoo, on the other hand, is still the leader as being the most popular destination on the Internet.  From news and sports, to maps, to movies, to email, to whatever, it's loaded with content to keep a visitor (unique, mind you) happy for hours on end.  Who will be the dominant search engine in the future?  Will it still be Google and we can term cyber searching "Googling"? or is it going to be "Did you MSN that?"  or "Go Yahoo that error message" or is it something else.
