I suggested that this blog be a central place for us all to post useful links and thoughts and such about PHP and advanced development, etc.  Maybe spitball some topics for our next meetup.  When you get here, please signup for a Blogger account and email  urlLink me , so I can give you permissions to post.   Thanks guys, I had fun!  Next time I say we meet a few blocks up the street at Gordon Beirch!
