I left work early on a Friday because I was driving to Ohio that day to go to  urlLink King's Island , home of The Beast (my favorite roller coaster of all time) and then on to  urlLink Cedar Point . I am a coaster fan, obviously.  Well, fan or not, no amount of enthusiasm excuses you from threatening the lives of children.  And that is exactly what I did... within the narrow eyes of the law, at least.  I was headed towards home earlier than usual and when I was on the road, just before the turn in to my neighborhood, a school bus was coming in the opposite direction.  Now, it had just slowed and the STOP sign was in the process of coming out as I was next to it.  Also note that it was in the far lane and I was as well, so we were separated by two lanes of traffic.  Well, I didn't want to slam on the breaks, nor was I completely positive on the non-touching lanes rule, but the flashing blue lights that sprung up behind me was a nice reminder.  The cop was your average cop and I was just an admitted lunk head so our exchange wasn't anything you'd see on COPS where I'm outside of my car in my wife beater while my baby's mamma is yelling at me with her curlers still intact, a cigarette limp in her mouth, and our two year old girl propped precariously on her hip, all the while the cop holding out one hand and murmuring "Calm down, ma'am... sir", with his other hand resting on his holstered Glock.  No, it wasn't anything like that.  I got a ticket instead.  That's fine, I was stupid so I'll pay up.  The city I live in mails you a notice with the amount, so when I hadn't received it within the 10 days suggested, I called.  There was a discrepancy with my address.  I moved last year and I forgot about my license address being wrong until this ordeal.  Anyway, I asked for the amount and where to send the payment.  Two-hundred and sixty-two dollars.  That's $262 in numeric money.  I totally missed the address because it's hard to hear over the words TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO DOLLARS echoing in your head.  You know... I like kids and everything, but it's not like I killed any.  What was this, a per head count?  Well, I had to get a money order unless I wanted to take off work to pay in person.  When I called back just to confirm everything, the woman said, "Yes, sir.  It's two-hundred sixty-two fifty."  I paused to let that soak in.  "And fifty cents?" I asked.  "Yes, sir."  I swear the first woman hadn't mentioned the fifty cents, but whatever.  "I got the money order for just two-hundred and sixty-two, could I possibly mail two quarters with it?"  Now she paused.  "I guess."  This posting would be a lot funnier if I had trusted the woman and mailed my money order along with two quarters only to be arrested tomorrow.  My court date was scheduled for today and me not showing up would have made for one interesting Casual Friday.  But, I wasn't too keen on going to jail over fifty cents and an "I guess."  So anyway, I have taken it upon myself since then to tell everybody what a dumbass I was and remind them that under no circumstances is it okay to not stop for a school bus.  A small price to pay for our world's future.  Damn, they're expensive little snots, though.
