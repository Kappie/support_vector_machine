They feed off of the minority masses to get all their stuff out when there are like 5 other stores like that in my area code, but whatever I haven't shopped there in a while, and I probably won't.     Right now I'm listening to Queens of the Stone Age, I got a t-shirt on the internet for them, it looks pretty cool, but I really like the band.  The first time I got their CD I was like they're ok, then all my cds got stolen and I bought a new one and put it in and hit random.  I was like blown away, I heard the coolest stuff ever, it was so melodic, yet somehow dark.  It felt really cool, like opening up the freezer and seeing a brand new carton of your favorite Ice Cream.  I bought all the albums I could get my hands on and one record, yes I still listen to records, they just seem to have more soul to them than cd's like you gotta sit down and listen to em like their incredibly important.     But anyway I love rock, classic rock, Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Led Zeppelin, and punk like the Dead Kennedy's and NoFX, and Metal like Down the Sun, and Tool, and Korn, but I don't like black metal, where everyone's screaming and you have like a creepy organ in the background.  It scares me.     *shudder* But yeah right now I'm learning this one song by Porcupine Tree it's really cool and has this really cool guitar part in it that sounds really prolific and just AWESOME.     I have to get back to reading in a little bit, I'm still not done with a Handmaid's Tale.  I don't think it's as good as 1984, but it's a nice update. It's a lot more modern I give it that but it gets really boring sometimes.  But it's very realistic.  Everyone I know has a best friend extremist lesbian who despises authority.  Not badmouthing lesbians or friends of lesbians, or anything, but the book just drags on and on and on... and it gets really tedious sometimes.  I guess that happens to me with all books, but I guess I just don't like assigned reading, in fact I hate it with a fiery passion that consumes my very being.
