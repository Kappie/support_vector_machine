I managed to drive my wife to work, and raced back to the apartment for a 'bathroom session'.  I ended up spending most of the morning in bed trying to sleep off whatever the hell bug i had.    I forgot to mention the kickass Trailer Park Boys episode that aired Sunday night.  As simple as their stories usually are, a whole lot happened in those 22 minutes.  That is one farking hilarious show.  I'm recovered enough to head in to work tomorrow morning, and this is going to be one short week.  There's a new project starting up at work.  It should be pretty cool.  Read:  "it will be pretty cool if i get to do some 3D work."  I've been craving some creativity at the workplace for over a month now.  Testing and revision cycles get me down.  I'm usually so bummed out after staring at the computer screen either testing or programming all day, that i don't want to sit down at home and bang out a 3D model.  As Rosemary Clooney would sing...Something's Gotta Give.  I'm out.
