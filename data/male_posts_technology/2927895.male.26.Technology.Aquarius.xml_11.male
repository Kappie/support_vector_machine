Everytime I open a Word document, the system hangs, and makes me have to reboot all over again.  There's this annoying contract document that I need to review and send it out to the customer but I just can't seem to get it done with.  Besides, I have over 80 more unread emails --- in other words, lots of work.    I am looking forward to this evening because I am going out.  I am looking forward to leaving as early as possible so that I can scuttle "someone's" plans of going to the airport...hehehe...wicked me :-)  More later...let me try making my system work atleast now.  If I can't, I am gonna log a helpline call.
