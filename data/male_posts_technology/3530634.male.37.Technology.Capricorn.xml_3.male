When the company first decided to move downtown, I was reluctant of course. Mostly because of the long drive. But working downtown has other advantages. Everything you could ever want is within a block or two. Greektown, the Casinos, Hart Plaza, The ren-cen and just about every bank in Michigan.  In its own way, Detroit is very beautiful; at least in the summer. The sidewalks are always awash with people of different colors, creed and backgrounds. Not as bad as in New York, but enough to make it interesting to watch.   The architecture downtown is simply amazing. You look at some of the old buildings and just contemplate how did they ever build that? Even the dilapidated buildings show signs of a bustling, busy downtown of an age ago.  The one fact about Detroit I think is so cool is that it is the only place in the United States where you can look South and see Canada!  One thing that amazed me when we moved downtown was the number of panhandlers / homeless people that roam the streets. A day doesn't go by when I'm not asked for money or a smoke while I take my daily smoke breaks. Some of the people that stop you look like they could really use the help. Others look like they make a better living off the streets than I do working! Others just walk by and don't say anything.  For some you feel pity; like the old man with the burns across his face and arms, complete with no ears. Looking at him almost makes you sick to your stomach. You wish you could do something for him and I often find myself digging into my pocket for change. I often wonder do I do it out of pity or out of the hope that it will make him and his grossly disfigured face go away?  I remember one day watching a man walking around in front of the building looking in trash cans. For what I'm not too sure but he never found anything. It looked as though he had all of his personal belongings in a few plastic grocery bags and stuffed into the pockets of the winter coat he was wearing; in the middle of summer. The man walked around not bugging anyone until he found a small patch of grass under the shade of a lone tree along Woodward Avenue. There the man carefully rolled up his torn and tattered coat and laid down for a nap.   How could this guy sleep with all the traffic and jack hammers and construction equipment I thought to myself. But I guess in the moment we forget that the small patch of grass he found was home for him. The sound of the cars and construction nothing more than a goodnight lullaby. We forget that this man has no bed to sleep on; no TV to watch. The sounds of downtown are as familiar to him as the sounds of the kids playing in the yard on a warm summer day are to me.  I often wonder how such a great place as The United States of America, who so quickly leaps to the aid of others in need can forget about her own people. Sure lots of people say "Why don't the bums just go get a job?". But let me ask you, would you hire someone who has had most of his face burnt off and smells like the dumpster in the back? Would you want to see this guy at the front counter of McDonald's as you walk in to get your Extra Value Meal?  Probably not.  So why doesn't he get disability or welfare or get on some government program. Well he could, but where would they send his monthly checks? Besides do you really think he would make enough to afford a place to live and food to eat?  Look at a man I call Eddy. He looks as though he is in his sixties. He is a short stocky man always with gray stubble on his face and a winter cap on his head. His shoes are tattered and torn and he is always wearing three or four jackets. He carries all of his belongings with him everywhere he goes and he always walks at a very quick pace never stopping to ask for money or a hand out. He's always moving. Where he's going I don't know but wherever it is, he is going.  Why can't the greatest country in the world create a program to really help people like Eddy and the others Downtown. Why not clean them up and get them a place to live? Teach them how to take care of the place and how to take care of themselves?  Maybe if we weren't spending 6.5 Billion a year on Nuclear Weapons or 9 billion a month looking for Weapons of Mass Destruction in a sand box most people can't even find on a map we would be able to take care of our own people.  Maybe if society wasn't taught to look down upon the less fortunate as bums not willing to work, only wanting a free lunch, we would find a way to help each other.   Until then, there's always the change in my pocket.
