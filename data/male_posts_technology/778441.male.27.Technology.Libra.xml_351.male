He said this on being asked about the future of his daughter Surabhi, who has passed her MBA with distinction from University of Wales.  " Our community does not allow that. So, she is back at home, " he explains, adding " Anyway, businesses can't be run by women, especially in India. She can do professional managerial work from home if she wants but she will not come to the office, " he says emphatically.  " Show me one woman who is running a business successfully, " he challenges.  Such sexist attitude! And that too from a person who is about the enter Rajya Sabha, supported by Congress, a party headed by a woman, who, among other things, aims to run the country one day!!  And ohh... by the way... in a completely unrelated piece of news, for the first time ever,  urlLink women on Forbes’ list  of the 400 Richest People in America topped men in average net worth, with $2.8 billion vs $2.4 billion for men.   Featured on that list at number 224 is Meg Whitman who's the President and CEO ( and has been since 1998 ) of  urlLink eBay  which is a $32 billion business today.   Any views on this, Mr. Dhoot?
