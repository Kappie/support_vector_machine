I'm planning on going to the zoo on Saturday I haven't been in a couple weeks and I love to walk around there. I've been thinking about the way our political system works. It seems to me that a controlling group see the people as stupid. Now I see the people as maybe a little ignorent but they are not stupid. I think the greatest fear of many is that the people will start to control their own destiny.  I think that many of the rich see the people as scum to be ignored. The amount of control that money related institutions exerts upon the people on a regular basis is scary. I find it mind boggoling that people would want to control other peoples lives at all.
