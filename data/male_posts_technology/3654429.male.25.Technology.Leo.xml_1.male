He doesn't even make the burritos, that poor SOB has to go talk to all the different businesses and get laughed at by the stuck up corporate types who run 15 miles a day and never eat anything with more than 2 carbs in it because thats the cool thing to do now.   The burrito guy...  Not only does the burrito guy keep raising his prices, he came up here yesterday with 1 beef burrito and 1 chicken...at 9:00am.  Now, I buy the occasional bacon and egg burrito in the morning but why even bother coming up to the 5th floor at 9:00am if you are out of all things breakfast??    I think he should deliver milk and cereal too..."how about some fruity pebbles burrito guy?"
