I look out to see what's happening and I can see some police and ambulance people running across the foot-bridge. The reason, there was someone actually IN the Clyde river. Which I thought was really amazing because I thought it was pretty solid. The helicopter actually dropped a small bundle - possible a life jacket but it missed the person by 10 metres. The paramedics dropped a round, orange life presever right next to the person but, I think the person couldn't actually see it. He/She swam back towards the bridge but swam right past the thing. The person eventually drifted out of sight... past a few more bridges - they really needed someone in the water - hope they got him alright.
