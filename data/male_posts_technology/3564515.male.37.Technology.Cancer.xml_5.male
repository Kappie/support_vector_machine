And all roads of Bangalore starts getting blocked. We also had some visitors before dinner. So, my wife and I ate late. And our second daughter was up till 10.30 before she slept. Otherwise she goes to bed at 9.45 or so. She is just about 2 now.  Now that all at home are asleep, I am back online. I am sitting in front of the TV connected via WiFi and TV is playing some junk Chinese martial arts movie. Anyway, TV is just to create some noise. Otherwise it is too boring. I wonder who watches all these movies seriously!
