Today is no different. Also, I am working on another post which is very big and I have yet to finish it. I hope to have that one done later today.   I will try to keep this one as brief as possible. It was an okay show. Could have been better. The problem is that when you focus on the entertainment aspect of the show, but neglect the actual wrestling, the show becomes uneven, slow and stupid. This was the case tonight. Also, the wrestling wasn't great. More on that later.  Show starts with The Rock. Good start. Funny. Came out to a huge ovation. Wow, people love this guy. Especially in Florida. This guy has so much talent behind the microphone. Good start.  I'm pretty sure this is going to spike Mr. Tito's ratting for the show.  Anyway, Rock rips on everyone and their mother, literally. Randy Orton comes out and gets his ass handed back to him, thereby establishing a possible future feud between the stars. Maybe, Wrestlemania XXI?  Rock gets thrown out of the building for being rowdy. Of course, we've seen this shit before, but it's still nice to see the Rock, even if the WWE is recycling stuff from the last couple of years.  We go to a match for the Womenâ€™s Champion. Trish Stratus (with Tyson Tomko) defeats Victoria in a so - so women's match. Nothing to phone home about. My only gripe is that Victoria still insists on wiggling to her crappy new music. Sure, she didn't go into the full rutine,  but the intent was there. I guess people in the back must have screemed: "Don't do it, Victoria!!!"  Anyway, Victoria needs a new personality. I used to like her. No, it's like I don't know her anymore. Someone please bring my favorite psycho bitch back.   Question... someone dressed as a woman stood outside of the ring and seemed to try to defent Victoria from an after match beatting by Trish and Tomko. It was a man, baby!!! It looked a little like Steve Richards. Oh Lord, not another gender confused wrestler. I just hope this is a way of developing this new Victoria.   Okay, Regal complains to Eric about his mystreatment of Eugene in an interesting back stage segment, which leads uncle Eric to book Regal's first televised match in several years with none other than Mr. Feud-With-Everyone, Kain. And, of course, a beatting followed. I was very sad cause I was really looking foward to a real match, but when Kain was anounced as the oponent, I knew where the WWE was going. Anyway, helped further the tension for the main event. No William Regal for the night to defend Eugene from HHH.  I will comment that regal looks buff and actually looked fast in the little moment where he actually had some offence against Kain. I guess we will have to wait till next week for something better. Maybe Eugene and Regal VS HHH and Ric Flair? That would make me happy. I really want to see Flair and Regal fight against each other. I think these two, with their combined experience in the ring, can pull off something special.   Okay, next we have Randy Orton and Batista against Edge and Chris Jericho. I actually fell asleep with this match. Not because it was boring (even thought it seemed like a standard RAW match between these guys), but because I was terrible sleepy. I have been taking some cold medicine because I think I'm coming down with something. Of course, the match helped a little.  Missed when Jericho was taken out of the match. My mom told me today that it looked pretty ugly. When I woke up, I recall watching Edge being beatten by Batista and Orton and I though: "Where's Jericho?".   So, Orton and Batista win and Edge is left in a bloody mess.  I'm not sure if Jericho's injury is legit or a work. Since I didn't see it, I can't say if it was or wasn't. My mom said it looked very nasty. But then again, my mom almost died with HBK's injury last week and that was most defenetly a work.   After this, we had a segment with Kain telling Matt Hardy that Lita's baby was actually his. Funny stuff, but not in the intensional sence. Lita can't act. The last few weeks it was a sad thing watching her try to act. Now, it's just plain funny. She tryed, thought.  Matt storms off and Lita follows...  Lita: "Wait!" Matt: "Is the baby mine?" Lita: "It could be..."  Hahaha I liked that line, actually.   After that, we get Triple H VS Eugene. This was actually a well developed main event. What I liked is that it really felt like a story was being told. Some pretty funny humour and excitement in the match. Mostly because the audience is reacting to this storyline in such an increbidle way. They are eatting it up. Bizarre! Anyway, interesting match, mostly played for entertainment. Probably one of the better entertainment matches. HHH was a real sport here. Benoit gets involved as HHH gets ready to beat the crap out of Eugene with a chair. Benoit cleans house, but accidentally clocks Eugene with the chair. Pedrigre to Benoit and Evolution stands triumphant again.   So, the match ended in a no contest.  There are some rumours that there might be a Eugene VS Benoit VS HHH at Vengence. Oh, please !!! Eugene is an experiment. A successful experiment, but an experiment none the less. The WWE has to tread carefully. Fans enjoy the segments and matches with Eugene, but will turn against the gimmick if the WWE tryes to push it down our collective trouts or actually gets Eugene into a serious main event.   The show was pretty lame. The main event was cool and the Rock's appearance in the beginning was awsome. The rest of the show just didn't work. I'm giving the show a C-. I am being generous because of The Rock. This show should have been more a wrestling show if the main event was going to be an entertainment match. If the show insisted on being more entertainment than a wrestling show, the main event should have been a serious main event. So, this was an uneven show. It would have helped if the middle match (Edge and Jericho VS Batista and Orton) would not have turned into a handicap match. Also, Edge feels stale. He was more exciting on Smackdown. Then again, against oponents like Benoit and Angle, even a mop could turn in a four star match.  So, if you missed this show, you didn't miss much except some story advancement.  Well, thats it for today. See ya next tuesday.   urlLink Sailor Ecchi
