I have always subscribed to the theory that I would put out all my ideas at once and let them develop as they should through the process. Feeling that their are no limits to what should be stated and just continue to push the thought forward.  I now define the limit as the point where the idea is too over the top, or just nuts.  So I apologize to all of my victims for the over the top methods of my collaborations. Lets see if this limit has any effect.
