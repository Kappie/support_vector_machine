Apparently their politicians like to individualize themselves based on issues and platforms rather than the trendy way they fundraise. . . neanderthals.   blog    n.  Short for weblog.  A meandering, blatantly uninteresting online diary that gives the author the illusion that people are interested in their stupid, pathetic life. Consists of such riveting entries as "homework sucks" and "I slept until noon today."   v. intr.  The act of posting to a weblog.  Courtesy of  urlLink www.urbandictionary.com   And yes, having nothing else in my life, I've been talking blogs with people.
