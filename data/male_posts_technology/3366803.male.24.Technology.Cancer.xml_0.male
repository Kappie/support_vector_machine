So why the fuck did I just spend an hour and a half waiting for the clowns at the electricity company to get their shit together and fix my power? The occasional blackout I can understand, but this wasn't any ordinary blackout. There was power, but at substantially fewer volts than advertised.  This may sound better than a normal blackout, after all, the lights still lit up - albeit slightly dimmer than they usually do. But there was a downside. On the way to low volts, it appears we went through a brief period of high volts. I really don't appreciate having a perfectly functional server converted into a pile of crap that refuses to boot unless you wave a dead chicken over the ATA controller before the BIOS gives up on detecting the broken drive. Particularly when said server is the critical component without which my network collapses in on itself. Oh, it also holds 5-ish years of email archives. And it handles connecting to the net. And my ISP wouldn't respond to phone calls trying to get the details I needed to set up another box to connect instead.  It's a bad sign when it takes less effort to first figure out why a hard drive that was perfectly fine 2 hours ago is not being detected anymore and  then  to come up with a temporary way around the problem than it does to get in touch with anyone who's even vaguely useful at your ISP.  Oh well, maybe I'll get a replacement for the drive at least out of the electricity company's insurance and claims department. I doubt it, but maybe.
