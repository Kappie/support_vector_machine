The sudden breeze wiped the air clean like a chalk board.  With no audence I think the effect of a internal sigh was the best I could muster. I was 21 now. Just lost my job, my girl, most of my friends, currently broke, had to give up my apartment. Living mostly on the couch I would pass out sometime during the 4th or 5th movie I would bring home. A watered down Sloe gin and coke my loyal friend watching over me as I slept. My father allowing me to move back home and regain whatever sense of self I could find. Scraping up pieces of who I used to be a daily chore each morning. I was as the very smoke that disappeared in the air, wiped clean, the medication and hospital stay clenzing me of all my sins, memories, values and hope. There job to wash the insanity from my soul and letting me start anew, reborn with in white walls I was now free to do as I pleased, even if I didn't know what that was.  I was glad that morning as I was the only one at the store. I gathered our selection of music videos and began my morning routine or checking in the evening drop offs, cleaning spilled drinks and other liquids that found there way into our box. I humed along to a woman's voiceI, liked this tune, it was up beat and today I could imagine I was a up beat guy.   I glanced up as the cute girl from the pizza shop down the street pulled up in her bug. I would trade her a one of our Wild Cherry Pepsi's for one of her grape sodas. She was under the impression that I enoyed the purple liquid, though I hadn't in the past I didn't think today would be any different but I did enjoy the time with her as we chatted about our lifes. She was still in high school I found out, boy friend, job, band and a taste for Wild Cherry flavored soda. With her drink finished it was time for her to start her shift she walked away and I droped my soda in the trash.
