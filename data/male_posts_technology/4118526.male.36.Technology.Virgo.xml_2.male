And I want a place where the kids and the dogs can roam free without worry.  So living in the country is the ticket I think.  Saturday we went to Aiken to visit a modular home dealership.  Strangely I was impressed until they gave me the price.  Ouch.  Currently around here it costs about $85 to $95 per square foot to build a house.  Modulars cost between $55 and $65 per square foot to build.  So we thought this might put us under the magic number I have in my head as far as financing goes.  With three kids so far with plans for just one more we want a house with five bedrooms.  That way every one gets their own room.  Also we want the garden tub in the master bedroom and walk-in closets.  We also want a wrap around porch so we can have porch swings and rocking chairs and so the kids can run the Matchbox cars off the edge of the porch.  Or set up the race track or the Lego blocks and play in the shade of the porch.  It is not so much to ask but it costs to much to dream about.    I want to build a stone or brick fence around the yard and have a long drive way with oak trees planted on both sides.  Kind of like Twelve Oaks in Gone with the Wind.  I want to be in one place and never have to worry about having to every move again.  I am tired of moving.  I have been divorced before so of course it nags at me the idea of building a house to share with my new wife on my family's land.  I don't want anything to ever take that land away.  It isn't made of gold and it doesn't have oil underneath it but I still want it to always be in my family.  Land to me is a rich inheritance.  If I keep this land in its current shape it will always have trees and when the world knocks down every tree to build a mall I will have the last trees left.  I would love to buy even more land.  I want to preserve it all.
