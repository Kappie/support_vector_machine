Just came back from the COUZ(College United Zone) Leader's retreat in Borga..a very ulu town in Kajang ...a very hot campsite own by Grace PJ. Sigh...the things that reminded me of camp still haunts me till today ..what with body aches and cramps from all over my body and what's with the aroma and odour from Sate Kajang last nite...  The flashing flashbacks of teambuilding games, the worship encounter with God and the workshops held by Ps Lindy and Ps Lee Choo...that have been instilled in us ...remains a comforts knowing whatever we have learned still remains even today...albeit the retreat was just yesterday...even in 2 days times, it felt like a 4 day full camp conference.and really That place have been saturated with the glory of God so much so that when you breathed in ....God was everywhere.  I am gonna blog about it more as there's a lot of stuff i would like to share with Dewgem cause i believed not only the teachings taught here is to bless the COUZ here in SIBKL but i believed it applied to every College Ministry in everywhere. Borga Campsite is fanstastic for small group retreats and the games there is fanstastic...and really as i compiled pictures from everyone ...i will slowly post some pics to show u what is all about...  In the mean time use your imagination....hehehe  JOshua Tan
