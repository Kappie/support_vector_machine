It was at times quite hard to stay awake, and I even fell asleep a couple of times, but finally 6am came.  I immediately went to bed and slept about an hour before Ivy and Aidan came in and woke me up.  I then groggily talked to them not really hearing them when they complained or said they were hungry.  I was really out of it.  I changed Aidan, and got lunches ready for the kids.  Then I did dishes from last night.  When L took the kids to school, I finished up the dishes and went to bed.  But then I wasn't tired.  I watched a little TV, talked to S on the phone, and eventually got drowsy.  I slept until around 11:30, when I heard the dog barking and someone outside - oh, Culligan was here, to fix the water softener.    $115 and an hour later, the softener appears to be fixed.  We should expect less hard water within a week.  I should expect to refill the salt sometime in the next 2-3 weeks.  Then I showered and got ready for work.  I also worked on Sunday night, doing SAP backups for about 4 hours.  And last night, part of my phone shift was also doing SAP backups (which helped to pass the time, at least).  Tonight, Wednesday, and Thursday, more SAP backups.  But I've setup my laptop now and I can do all that stuff remotely.  Since S has WLAN, I can do it from her place .... sweet!  I'm also on call this week, and I'm trying to figure out what day to take a comp day.  It's complicated by other people taking comp days, vacation days, and more phone shifts.  It looks like Thursday Steve and Rich are taking off.  And Friday, Steve's on vacation, Rich's phone shift starts at 2, John usually takes off at 2, and I got the appraisal guy coming at 2:30.  So maybe Wednesday would be a better day for a comp day.  Then I could just see S tonight and sleep over tonight, lazing about tomorrow, taking in lunch and some shopping.    I'll have to pose it to S to see what she thinks.  We could still do a date Friday night, of course.  Also, I was thining on the way to work today that really our anniversary would be on August 9th, since that's the day that we committed to each other, as opposed to our first date.   Hmmmmmm.  S is going to follow Mo's suggestions for "cleansing" her system .... since she's plateaued on weight loss.  I'd also like to follow a strict regimen for a diet.  I realize, though, that a big reason that I've plateaued is that I'm not exercising nearly enough.  I also need to work tonight, putting that fucking parallel port card in that fucking server.  I'm so sick of all the loops I have to jump through for these change controls.  I was going to see S nearly immediately after work, but now I'll be delayed at least a little while I take care of the change control.  I've pushed it to 5:15, with customer approval, and fuck you to anybody who says I can't do it then.  Work, change controls, on-call .... all that gets very complicated when I throw custody / visition with kids into the mix. I can't really be on call at the same time that I have kids sleeping at the house, because if I need to leave to go on-site, I can't because then I'd leave the kids home alone.  Rich has offered to work with me on that, but I'd prefer to have it worked out as part of my divorce agreement.
