I was quite stressed by it all and ended up having an early night, because I felt completely knackered - Jo was working at college, and Mum looked afterthe kids until about 7:30.  So it was just a case of picking them up putting them to bed, sorting a few things out for today and then bed!!  Today it was just a case of picking up a few lintels and waiting for Pat the groundworker to come.  He is going to prepare the drains today and tomorrow, with a view to laying the pad on Tuesday - (already busy on Monday).  So I think it's a few beers to wind down tonight and then get on with tidying the mess that has been created over the last few days over the weekend - still the weather looks like it's going to be good. Hurrah!
