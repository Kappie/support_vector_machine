What we need are players who will be First Team regulars, not just additions to the Squad.  We have enough of them already.  There are some who do not seem to have the character to force the Management Team to consider them as regular picks.  Under O’Neill the favoured 11 has been consistent and this, I believe, has been a fundamental reason for our success in the last 4 years.  Some Signings have suggested much promise but subsequently failed to deliver – so far.  Some might walk into a few home truths when they meet up with the Management Team this pre-season.  I want every player in the Hoops to prove his worth and improve as his Celtic career progresses.  I take no pleasure in any Signing not working out.  Of course, everyone is concerning himself or herself with who will replace the Magnificent 7.  The answer is no one will.  Henrik and Celtic were a unique combination of circumstances that happen to Celtic every so often, and will again.  What needs to be replaced are his goals, team ethic and contribution to our success.  1 man may not be the answer.  It will probably require 2, who get into the team, game in, game out, and make an impact.  Over the last 4 years I believe Martin O’Neill, his Management Team and the players who have delivered big for us, have earned the Right to have some fresh faces willing to take their share of the load.
