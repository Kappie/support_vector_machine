But before that we have Ram's birthday. That too on a Sunday, So I guess he cannot escape from giving a treat to those in Bangalore.  Anyone knows where Ganesh is? I am not finding time to meet Rajesh and Bala here.   Since my last post was too long, I am keeping mum today. Of course, as the final between India and Australia will begin in the afternoon, I guess that's all from me today unless...
