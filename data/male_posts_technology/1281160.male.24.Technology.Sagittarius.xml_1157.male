Ofcourse, i was worried a bit of how to save money to buy gift for srini's birthday. That problem is solved now. good na! Yes, Srini left to SanJose yesterday without any hassles! (all becoz of my proper preparation plan) summa sollikka vaendiyathu thaan! Hope i dint have any leak holes in them..... Waiting for his call from there. Jax, this is very unfair, to leave this days work job like this and keep updating only QSS. come on, we all need u, in this blog too. this is highly unfair ya!  About ram's question, Vinitha only told me that both of them live in East coast and he is going for his ERP project only!  About kicha's question, Astrology is more on beliefs and to answer questions on, first we need to believe of which i can hardly help u out in describing what it is! so sorry i think, i may not help u in answering it, probably lets ask my senior to help u out with this regards. Really a complex question for an not fully formed individual like me!  ok guys will blog u all later!
