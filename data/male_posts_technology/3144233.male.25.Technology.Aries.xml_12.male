For more info on the walk see,  urlLink click here .  Some of you have sponsored us some have not but either way you will be receiving progress reports over the next two weeks or so.  Unfortunately not everyone who has sponsored us has got onto this mailing list and so if you know anyone who should be or would like to read the updates please forward them on.  We're in a real rush to catch the 2058 train up to Bristol so that's it for now, well send you an update of progress when we make some :)  Cheers  Bye  P.S. If you would like to wish us luck do so at  urlLink ed@generic.org.uk  or reply to the (hopefully) daily updates.
