So I go home because I have the WORST hangover.  Not suprisingly, Ben's shoes were in the usual place on my living room floor. How long did that last Ben? Like, 12 hours? Me, Yast and Adge drag ourselves to a cold and unforviging Belmar and our Autumners join us.  Craig and I blinded the majority of the beach with our extreme albinoness.  ha. The 3 chicks raced home soon after a call from LC telling of warmth and sunlight in good old Ewing.  Holla at the cute guy in the cherokee...mmmm.  Silly old Afunk went WAY overboard with the food...and I'm still burping up lighter fluid fumes mmmhmm.  hahha jk thanks adge kim and LC for the quick food and festivities. Work was crizzy tonight. Crizzy Mary's friend threatened my life 5 minutes after I met her. Things you DO NOT say to potential housemates when you first meet: "If you tell anyone any of this, I will fucking kill you. Seriously though, we'll fight." Oooookkkkk....CRAZZZZZY.  And my stalker from Panera kept coming in tonight trying to peddle his brownies and ice coffee in a feeble attempt to continue to talk to me.  I narrowly escaped a scary meeting with him at the end of the night. Thanks Kate!  "Does summer come for everyone? Can humans hear what prophets say?
