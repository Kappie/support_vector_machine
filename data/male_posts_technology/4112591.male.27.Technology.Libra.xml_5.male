There is or it seems to me anyway a hugh ammount of scaremongering going on  all over the Mainstream Media.  Stories about Threats, percieved Threats and the like. UK gov has just releases its onw pamphlet on what to do  "if" those peskey terrorists come calling, no we are getting near daily, wall to bloddy wall, the terrorists are coming , we just dont know when or where.  The American gov has got to be the worst offender, this admin is run on fear. Just look at the Homeland Security website to understand what I mean--  http://www.ready.gov/  I predict here in my first proper post the good ol dubbeya (GWB) will be saved in the nic of time and be re-elected due to a massive 911 style attack (my guess a dirty bomb), this should be enough to give him another 4 years, heck he may even cancell the bloody elections (I can confirm they have sought legal status if such a thing happens).  If this turns out to be the case, I see more wars on the way people and lots of them,  I believe the whole world will be shitting themselves at the thoughts of what the US response to any attack will be, remember the reasons used to justify the wars in Iraq and Afghanastan. All lies to further a foriegn policy goal which is to control the Oil come rain or shine.  As for the Uk I think it is most likly EU country to be targetted, being from Ireland this concerns me alot. I do not trust what the Blair gov has to say on anything, they are getting just as bad as the USA for the scaremongering, well they did not lick it of a spoon. Check their Pamphlet --http://www.preparingforemergencies.gov.uk/ .  I could go on and on but will not, my main point is that we are currently living in a cliamte of fear created by the gov  and centred on 1 main threat "Terrorism".  This has been the case since 911 and will continue to be the case for many a year to come.  I think this percieved threat is a tool of the gov to increase their powers over the citizens, implement policies which would not pass in cliamte of calm.   enough from me for now,  no doubt I will be back soon, I have copied the link below for you entertainment, I thought it was brilliant, have a look http://www.thomasscott.net/emergencies/index.htm,  Bye for now
