If you're not sleeping on the hard ground out in the cold night air, the bones in your shoulders creaking and cracking and bending in weird ways as you lay upon the hard motherfucking dirt, you're not living.  NOT LIVING, I SAY.  Me?  I'm living.  I spent my weekend out at Branched Oak drinking myself retarded and passing out by the campfire.  The camping was fun, but the drinking has left me wanting some specific B vitamins and some god damn potassium.  POTASSIUM, CAN YOU SPELL IT, MR. ROGERS?!   On another subject entirely, the documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 has apparently polarized everyone's political opinions AGAIN.  I'm not exactly surprised by this; it seems to be the way of things with anything even remotely inflammatory, but why is it not possible for people to have a moderate view of things?  Keep in mind, I have not yet seen the movie, but this exact same thing happens with every Michael Moore movie released.  Bowling for Columbine especially.  Why can't everyone just recognize that Moore is a fat crazy bastard who makes remarkably entertaining and engrossing films which make some valid points but are really focused on INTENTIONALLY PUSHING YOUR BUTTONS?!  Do you think the guy gets up after making one of his movies and is ASTOUNDED to read an unfavorable review in the newspaper because he is too partisan?  No.  He sits there and plans the whole fucking thing while rubbing his greasy hands together and snickering maniacally to himself in the dark with Pink Floyd's Atom Heart Mother Suite playing in the background and dollar signs in his eyes, knowing that both his political friends AND enemies are going to flock to his movie and give him money because it is SO FUCKING CONTROVERSIAL.  OOOOOOOOHHHH.  He's not fucking around, he SERIOUSLY WANTS TO PISS YOU OFF AND YOU ARE JUST FINE WITH THAT, EVIDENTLY.  The BARON has MOTHERFUCKING spoken!
