I asked a girl to be my friend yesterday, but she hasn't responded. I don't know how often she checks her mail, or if it went into a trash bin automatically, or if she's scared I'll turn into a lunatic....  Can men and women just be friends? I enjoyed the ideas presented in "When harry met sally", I think they mostly are true.   I signed up for friendster the other day, but I still need to get pictures up. It seems to me, that no picture = no contacts. After all you could be some hideously ugly freak:)  OK, I'm going to go look for a plug in for a friends website... Peace out-
