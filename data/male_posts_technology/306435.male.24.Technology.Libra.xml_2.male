Luckily the party down the street ran out of goods and the crowd needed somewhere to go.  We successfully kept people out of the apartment, although many people tried to come in.  Tom seemed to be havig  a good time, and that was the important thing.   Justin seems to be getting closer and closer to getting the Jeep.  His brother Tony went to look at one on Sunday.  I haven't heard much about it other than it was "nice".  Kristin started her own  urlLink blog  so you can read up on that.   Ann and company start school tomorrow.  they are having a big Manresa party tonight. It will be interesting to see how things change once school starts. Nutzo got the axe today at work.  It was very sad and depressing, like Ann said "there is nothing worse than an out of work clown who has ADD!"  I packed up all his stuff for the TekSystem girls to pick up.  He had a lot of crap in his desk.  It is nice that Chris is moving up to taking calls though.   We didn't win the lottery...that is just as depressing. Well I am going to quit typing here...I have a lot todo...songs to download...cd's to make (I didnt forget Kristin!)  Until then...
