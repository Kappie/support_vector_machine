The software industry has invented the next generations of frustration busting technology, which not only helps us live in complete harmony with nature but also helps the industry serve their customes better.  “We have found the next generations of frustration busting technology, which not only helps us live in complete harmony with nature but also serves our customers and helps us fulfill our mission statement of a “customer centric approach for a social and environmental cause”.  Says Mr Ghochu, CEO of Ghochus.com   Mr Ghochu also claims that the developing countries are an emerging market for this next generation of technology. The developed countries have already adopted it long back and we expect the market to grow in developing nations like India, in which the outsourcing business is flourishing. Mr Ghochu says. “There are early adopters and the signs are encouraging.” Says one of the implimentaing parteners of Ghadheys  Ghadheys.    The customers love it too. One of the IT pro Niranjan Daroopeeke says : “The correct question is what happens when you don’t get humans to interact with?. Now I no longer have to bang my head on my wodden desk. There is no need to replace damaged wood in the office resulting in reduced costs, improved bottomline and better valuations of our products to the customers.”    Our special correspondant also observed the lateral thinking this new technology fosters.One of the employee in the IT industry asked him : “I have an Intel inside and I share my feelings with her, what about you?”  The pre-requisites of this technology are minimal interaction with humans. The more you interact with them the more inutile it gets. But considering the surge in the next wave of information technology the chances of its getting inutile are remote.
