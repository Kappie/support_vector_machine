And then you know I had some relatives come over to my house. And then you know I had to organise an offsite for the team. And You know I was also going through some confusions that affected my already affected mental life. And then now you know although all these above said things are true, I'm good at giving excuses :). I've sort of now decided on the blog allocations. All my daily cribbings, cravings and other nonsenses would find its way into this blog. All the other occasional nonsensical stuff, that I also call creative writings and thoughts would go to  urlLink my home blog . And the other tamil nonsensical thoughts would go to my tamil blog  urlLink laadlabakdas . The last one actually,incidentally,accidentally got mentioned in  urlLink valaipoo . By now, you guys also must've realised that I'm good at planning. Now coming to the actual topic...I managed to get myself lost in the potholed, bumpy and curving roads of Banglaore...not once but twice. That too on consecutive days. On sunday, I dropped Mukund at his home and he started giving me directions. I told him that I had been there previosuly and I knew the route. Well, that was God's honest truth. 100..200..300 metres...got confused. Tried to find my way out but then got confused again. It took me atleast an hour to reach a place that should take 15 mins. If it happened one night, it happened again yesterday. I guess my experimental blood is showing up too much eventhough I know nobody is gonna credit my discovery as "Bala's Route". Yesterday was much worse because I was trying to find a route that was not in my part of the city. The worst thing about getting lost is you cant throw up your hands in despair and say "I give up". And whenever a junction comes up, you really get confused whether to turn, where to turn and the only thing that'll helps you to decide is the breadth of the road. Cos you think the broader the road the more chances it'll lead you to a main road. But I'll tell you that algorithm doesnt actually work. So the pursuit to be another Colombus continues...
