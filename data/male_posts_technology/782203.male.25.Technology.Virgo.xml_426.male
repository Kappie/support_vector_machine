Oh did go to dinner with a friend at Oliadome on Monday and hanged out at Borders later, that's about it. Heh was reading Dilbert, damm that comic is really funny as hell, and can really relate to the jokes about the workplace. Thought this one was really funny.    1st colleague : I would like you to join the TTP project.  2nd colleague : What does TTP stand for ? 1st colleague : TTP stands for the "The Ttp Project" 2nd colleague : *Groans*    Haha don't you just love recursive jokes ......eh wait a minute... damm I really need to get laid.
