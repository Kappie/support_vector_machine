Just came across a brochure of a music institute which emphasises on Invovlement to learn music against Concentration.   It goes further and explains the difference between them.   Invovlement is spontaneous which you experience in watching Dramas, T.V., Movies, reading a Novel etc., where as, preparing for examinations, studying text books, requires Concentration. The results of Concentration are short lived where as the impacts of Involvement are more or lesss permanent. This is the reason why you remember T.V. serials, movies and novel for a very long time even through you have not attempted to concentrate artificially.   And finnaly they suggest that this is the reason, why one should learn to get involved rather than mugging up the lessons while learning music.  This is really a good reason to change our attitude towards learning...!!  What say?
