The medium was English and English medium schools were very rare at my place that time. it was located in the nearest town to my Village. The town named Mananthavady was the cultural and business centre of Wayanad District.                  Then I  completed my high school studies in the year 1997 from St. Catherines HSS Payyampally which is located very near to my home. During that time my father was the principal of the school and my mother was teaching there. So I had great responsibilities. It turned out that what ever I did in the school became a talk. So I the situation forced me to be an ideal student always. Otherwise my activities would throw mud on the images of my parents.                   Later I joined St. Joseph's College, Devagiri for my Pre Degree Course which was locaed it the neighbouring district to my home. I was a student in the science batch(Mathematics - First group) I stayed in hostel there and completed PDC in the year 1999. Now the Pre Degree System no more exists. I was lucky to be a student of last batch of PDC in the state. Because government changed the system to Higer Secondary Education from 1999.                                In 1999 I attended the state engineering entrance exam and got through it. I have an option to take the engineering seets available in the state. I opted for Computer Science and Engineering in Govt Engineering College, Wayanad. The college is situated in Mananthavady and I joined the college. My batch was the first batch of my college. I opted for the particular seat because the institution was very near to my home. I finished my B.Tech programme in the year 2003. The college was affiliated to the University of Kannur.
