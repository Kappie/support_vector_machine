I think this is going to be like jumping into cold water, it takes you a while to get used to it.  This teaches me to choose my words, I never know who might read them.  What if I lived my life like that.    So yesterday I realized that life is too short to complain.  I believe complaining is one of the biggest struggles today.  People do it all the time, sometimes not realizing it.  I sometimes complain but often try to catch myself before it's verbalized.  A positive aspect of being a Christian is that God gives us hope and joy through the tough times, something most of the world does not have.    For example, yesterday was a small demonstration of what the great Flood could have been like.  It rained like goats and cows.  And yes, the top was off my jeep.  So I jumped in my tug boat of water and headed to guitar practice.  People always give you a funny look when you are in a Jeep with the top off, while it is raining.  Or maybe it's because I keep an umbrella over my head at the redlights.  Anyway, after practice, it's still pouring and I get to talk to this guy at the door of the music store.  You always ask yourself, ok, how can I witness to this guy?  Sometimes I do, sometimes I fail.  I didn't get to witness to this man, but it was funny how we started our conversation.  He says something about all the rain and then..."Wouldn't you hate to be the guy driving the Jeep with the top down right there."  Of course I had to fess up and admit that it was mine and I was the dummy who didn't put the top on his jeep or remember to check weather.com.  But either way...the rain, my top down, a soaking wet ride led up to being able to meet a new friend that I will now see on a weekly basis at the music store.
