Cats should all die, besides cait. Cait deserves to live, because she's my evil henchkitty. She terrorizes cats that are twice her size, and that deserves respect, f00. And her bad-ass name. Cait Sith. Nothing's better than that. Anways, cats really suck. They shit in your lawn, and then PRETEND to cover it up. You wont notice it for a while, but then it rains...That brings the smell of all 10000000 piles of cat excrement to life, and it is a bad time. Very bad time. Well, anyways, life is good. Things have been resolved, and...yeah...good times. Is anyone else going to natasha's party? Cause i dont want to go if i'll be the only one of "da krew" that shows up. That wouldnt be cool. Well, lemme know.
