I officially handed in my notice today and have given the company up to 8 weeks to try and replace my invaluable self ;P  Have passed the point of no return and it feels GOOD.  Also sorted out things with Helena. We are officially not seeing each other at all any more.. Was good we got that sorted out at this stage before things got violent :)  K, enough piss ant crappy blogging, go read something more interesting god damnit.  P.S. Donations to the soon to be unemployed person gratefully accepted. Now piss off you wanker. (What? You say you aren't a wanker?? Pull the other one..)
