The server is stuck between two dressers and has a second server sitting on top of it.  Needless to say, the air flow isn't so great and the temperature was simply too hot when running the proc at 100% 24/7.  Maybe someone else is cracking for me...   That would make for a pretty cool trojan/virus.  Have it simply install dnetc then attempt to infect other computers.  When it was finally discovered,  urlLink distributed.net  would be shut down, but hopefully not until I had won the $1000 prize.
