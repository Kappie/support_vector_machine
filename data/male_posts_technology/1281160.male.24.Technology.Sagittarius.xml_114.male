Kavitha getting into infy, jax getting a hike... and we cud expect more to come...  but dunno whats happening with vinod... now, should we believe him or not....   Its nice thing that Kavitha is reporting in Bangalore... so soon our blog and mailing people's number will rise to 1 more...  but its a pity that kavi will not be able to meet ranjini (or should I say, ranjini will not be able to meet kavi - or anyone for that matter) ---not even for her b'day treat...thats very sad.... ain' it... how can ranjini be so cruel to her friends...   Kicha
