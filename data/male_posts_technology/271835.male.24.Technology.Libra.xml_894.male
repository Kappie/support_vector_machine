Godfrey Bloom, their new MEP for Yorkshire and Humber is concerned about women  urlLink "Because I just don't think they clean behind the fridge enough" . He also went on to say that no right minded businessman would ever employ a woman of child bearing age. I'm not sure what to make of UKIP, maybe they're having a laugh but I'm sure they're up to no good. I suspect they appeal to anyone who would like to bring back hanging, national service, corporal punishment, ban immigration and, if Mr Humber has his way, to put women back in the kitchen. No doubt they appeal to those who are too embarrassed to vote BNP.
