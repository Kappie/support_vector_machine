It was a suprise phone call yesterday from the Casting Director, my now agent, Wizzy Ringer, needing to see me as soon as possible...So off I ventured today for my very first very special photo shoot! Oh Joy! So arriving at their plush South Melbourne Offices, looking my best...I was greeted by a stylist and some wardrobe chick...very fun....Anyway, we will see where this goes now....but they sounded very positive, and considering that most people dont get their feet through the door, I must be doing something right, and considering that I missed the last appointment almost a year ago, cos I was hung over (I told them there had been a death in the family, well I felt like death), Its amazing that they still know who I am....  Kaia is preparing to leave me tonight, her last night (for three and half weeks), there seems to be a common theme here...What have I done??!??!  So keep smiling...And Carrie where is my postcard?
