She was so awesome we had a great time going to the park, going to the zoo, we went up in the Seattle space needle and much more.    I had to drive 2500 miles to see her and to give my Ex-wife the mustang.  I am now a single guy stuck with a minivan!  The drive back was not as bad as the drive up the mustang although a cool car was not desinged for cross country travel.     Here is the trip I took to and from.  On the way up I traveled by myself I stopped for 2 hours and slept in a truck stop.  It took a total of 40 hours to get from my home in Houston, TX to my parents house in Lake Stevens, WA   On the way back my aunt came with me as she wanted to see Houston.  The trip back only took 35 hours! Not sure why the time difference but whatever.   Leaving my daughter was very hard for me it is one of the hardest things I have had to do in my life.  I did not want to go but I did my best to keep my composure and move on.     I am going to do my best to put something on these blogs daily if for no other reason then just to say I did it.
