My play was extremely conservative and not very profitable.  For the next couple of weeks, I had to learn to loosen my play and quit thinking about the money.  It was only $25 but it felt like 25 million.  That was hard to get over.  After I finally got comfortable, my play got better.   My buddy had been playing quite a bit also.  He favored tournaments over table play and I thought he was a fool for doing so.  I would tease him and tell him that it would take over an hour for him to just win $9 if he was lucky.  I could do that in one hand at the NL table.   He put money into his account and we were both imaginary high rollers, ready to beat this game.  What a fantasy. My bankroll went up and down but down more than up.  My play was getting better but not profitable.  I kept watching my buddy get better at tournament play and realized he was getting a hell of a lot more play for less money.  I needed to see more flops, analyze more hands, encounter more playing styles if I was going to get good at this.  So now I had to eat crow and start playing tournaments.  I guess I was the fool. I started playing the play money tournaments to get used to the new setting for me.  My first tournament, I took first.  That was a good feeling.  Too bad it was for play money.  But it showed me that I could play that tournaments as well. I started playing more play money tournaments and started to love it.  I had more fun and got a lot more experience.  The play was more realistic and it still didn't effect my bankroll.  Now it was time to play for real money.......  Time to go to work.  I'll post more later.  Indiana Slim
