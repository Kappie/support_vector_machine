And I feel like I am in real danger of losing something that I really treasure.  Hope it's just me over-reacting.  But I just can't help feeling that I do not deserve all this.  But hey who said life is fair right.   I was blog-surfing a couple hours ago and I stumbled into 1 which mentioned that she found my blog humorous and insightful.  It really made my (crappy) day. Yeah ok so its a little strange to be glad about being flattered by someone whom I never met or talked to , but with the day I had it was really what I needed.  At least there are still people who think I'm not all that bad. Now I just have to make sure I never meet her so that she will never think otherwise.   I was supposed to go drinking with my bro-in-law and his friends tommorow night , but I changed my mind. They are nice people and all but I can't really click with them. So will probably be staying at home alone.  Not exactly the way I wanted to start my new year but not much choice there.
