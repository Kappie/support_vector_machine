Now that we can taste freedom, we have all become very thirsty. Speaking personally, I enjoy much of the lifestyle here and am happy working with our green club, which is growing in strength slowly but surely. That said I also can't wait to leave the village now. I find myself finding more and more excuses to stay away for evenings here and there, for a little respite from village life our host family.   What most people think of when they hear the word monsoon is of course rain. There is indeed a lot of rain and often it falls for more than 24hrs without stopping. The real problem for us four on our particular placement is mud. We are living deep in to the rural village area, far away from grit stone or paving. This means that getting anywhere takes three times as long and is five times as difficult. On the other hand I don't sweat when I eat now. I only have to wash once a day and only need to drink twliterses of water. After the blazing heat stormy weather is a real treat but the mud makes life very difficult. And lets not be shy about it; its not so much the mud as all the feces and urine swilling around amongst the grey, brown slime beneath your toes, which puts us off the idea of leaving the house. Indeed the sisters of our family don't leave the house at all for two months, not that they do much anyway.  Like I said the rain isn't much of problem, its nice to listen to and everything looks wet and green and like a jungle. I even like wading through the newly formed thigh deep lake outside our village on the way to the rest of the world.  Except there is always that niggling panic at the back of your mind that you might have to pull a fat bloodsucking leach off your leg once you get to the other side. Speaking of scary wildlife, my snake count is now seven; four alive and three dead. I even touched a dead one the other day. With each encounter I become a little less anxious. And no I haven't seen a cobra yet. Although a friend of mine has a photo of two huge cobra making love in the night. This was quite a sight even in a photo. The cobra were in a long line on the ground, intertwined except for the heads which were raised high holding each others gaze. Quite remarkable. It was a beautiful sight and completely unthreatening apparently. It was learned that later that evening somebody was bitten a mere 15m away by one of the snakes, and had to be rushed to hospital.  The work itself has been hard but fun and satisfying sometimes too. We all feel that we have only begun a project, and are far from finishing anything with the community or with the children.  If everything goes to plan, there will be another two placements in the coming two years, and our work wont all have been in vain. However it is not definite with the political situation as it is that there will be the follow up placements intended. Even if there turns out not to be, we have given the kids a great time, taught them a few things and increased their confidence a good deal. Personally I have learned quite a lot in my time out here and would recommend  urlLink SPW  to any young gap goers looking to do such work.  From Joel's Nepali Adventures.
