Members of the band, who, stranded in the middle of a cold, wet field, instruments in hand, are trudging on their way to a gig. They see bright lights and discover a happy family inside a cozy, warm home. Mom, dad and the kids are sitting at the dinner table, happily laughing and enjoying what can only be described as a perfect family life. One musician looks at another and says "How do they live like that?"    album of the day:   urlLink    bent        programmed to love
