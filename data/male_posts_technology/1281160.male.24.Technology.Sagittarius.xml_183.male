It has strengthened considerably. It was 49.7 in June '02. And that is not good news for the Indian IT firms. iFlex CFO says he expected rupee to depreciate by 3-4% annually as it was happening all this time. But contrary to all expectations rupee is becoming stronger by the day and expected to rise further... Either Indian companies move business out of US slowly and steadily... or perish. Nobody wants the latter to happen and the former is going to be a big struggle.... so much for India's IT prowess...
