The group of girls had three arguments and make-ups, interspersed with screaming, playing in the wading pool, talking about horses, snacks, movies about horses, screaming, playing with toy horses, chasing Dan, screaming, and pretending to be horses.  They were loud until about 1:30 am, then finally went to sleep.  I was out at 12am, but Anne stayed up until about 1 am.  We got up about 7 am and cooked bacon and pancakes for all the kids.  Nikki slept latest, waking up at about 9:30, after one girl had already gone home.  So after everyone went home, I am exhausted, another migraine setting in, just thinking about relaxing for the day, maybe take care of some small tasks at home.  Anne and the kids suddenly decided to go to the fair, but I didn’t want to go, so they went without me at about noon.  Since then, I have been on the laptop writing blog stuff, e-mail, my therapy journal, while keeping track of the Arena Bowl (San Jose wins, 69-62, who really cares?) and eating.  I have had a big bowl of “grasshopper” ice cream (that’s chocolate chip mint, for those who don’t know) and bacon so far.  Boy, do I love bacon!  Maybe I’ll write a poem.
