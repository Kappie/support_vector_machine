They have never been fast enough, the code has never been clean enough or laid out correctly, and the features and menus have always been far too cluttered and hard to use. Dreamweaver MX has changed my mind about many (but not all) of these concerns. Although I still prefer to write code myself, Dreamweaver offers a viable alternative."

 I would consider myself a staunch hand coder myself as well as an avid Homesite user, and I would have to say I like Dreamweaver MX for the most part. It's performance and speed could use some work though, but when it comes to database development it takes out a lot of the grunt work.
