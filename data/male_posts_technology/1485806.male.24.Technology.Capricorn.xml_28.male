For the beginning of the week, i have spend an enourmous amount of money to buy stuff for my room, with the once in a blue moon trip down to Ikea.I have to rebuy some toiletries and well send my clothes to the Dobi, cause well in these past few years, in the house i have been spoiled with having a washing machine, semi-automatic one but still. What with graduation convocation coming, all the more must save my money. Which is why i must slowly stop eating so much , little by little, to prepare for a fasting .   Me, i am very noticable in my physique, if i get thin, well you can see the difference and when i am fat , which is all the time, you can see it too.. So well , i am comfortable with who i am and how i look, but there is a burning desire to improve myself so that i can do all things i can't previously do before. I must exercise both my faith and physique.  Ragnarok Online was one of the past time, that i have played , to keep me entertained with something to do.  Hmm..prayer meeting is tonite, i must go there....just to immerse myself in the atmosphere of faith urand corporate prayer....about the encouragement...well cannot think of a title...so  well Let's pray and fast for the loves ones who have not known Christ. Pray for those who have resisted the gospel and for those who are your enemy. After the lesson God taught me about Siok Chye, i have not begin to doubt what God can do....a lot of my christian friends who always thought that Siok Chye 's fate of not becoming a christian, is predestined. Well to hell with predestination or some theology arguments about this and that...It stops us from doing the real work...
