(I define fledgling souls as beings that have finally discovered that they are a soul and not a body:-)). Or rather help them not lose their way. So here are a list of books that any soul worth its salt should avoid at all costs.  1. Illusions - Richard Bach - Richard Bach tops my list of purveyors of kitsch in the garb of neo-spiritualism. Bach attempts to peddle Advaita to the masses and succeeds for maybe 5 minutes. But if you are serious about wanting to know about the self, find a different Guru.  2. Conversations with God - Neale Donald Walsch - What put me off most about this book, is the author's claim that God ordered him to write the book. Don't read this book if you want a personal relationship with God or you feel you have one.  3. Notes to Myself - Read this book for a prime example of how you can convert an ego trip into a profit making enterprise. First you had Notes to Myself, then Spiritual Notes to Myself, Notes to Each Other and then Notes on Letting Go....yeesh!!!!  4. Autobiography of a Yogi - The first half is good, the second half is an exercise in excess. Reading the second half, especially the revelations of Yogananda's guru on life after death temporarily destroyed any interest I might have had in the spirit. It can confuse the daylights out of you.  5. A Bridge Across Forever - Richard Bach - This book, contrary to other Bach books, seems to go on forever. Maybe that explains the title. It is a long and tedious saga of Bach's quest for his soulmate. What compounds the tedium is not just that Bach divorced his soulmate but also subsequently explained it in suitably spiritual terms of being temporarily separated in his journey and all that blah. This was on his official website which now seems to have been taken over by his publisher.  There is a single thread that runs across all books (except the Yogi) - they are all pulp fiction in the garb of true spiritual experiences. They try to claim legitimacy for purely materialistic intents by portraying their authors as spiritually advanced beings who have been asked by the Divine to enlighten poor souls like you and me (and also make millions in the process). They make a mockery of what is essentially a personal and totally individual quest. There is a palpable lack of sincerity in the words. In essence, they lack 'Om' - a union of the spirit, body and the mind:-).  If you want a list of books that do inspire, start off with Gandhi.
