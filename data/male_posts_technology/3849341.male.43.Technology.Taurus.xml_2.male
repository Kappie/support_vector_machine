He is both a man of integrity, and a man after God's own heart. It is rare to find both qualities in someone today. This is something that Reuben felt led to do, and I believe God will use him over there to reflect his glory to a people in desperate need of the knowledge of God. If you read this, I would ask you to pray for Reuben that God will fulfill his purposes in his life
