I'm gonna use this blog to rant about technology...and how it kills.  So, if you ever have one of those days where you go furthur backward than forward, let me hear about it....rant about it. If you ever get frustrated at your tech job and think "God, it can't be healthy for a person to sit in front of a screen for so long!" or "why is my screen flickering" and you realize its your eyes....then just blog it.  Well, I might blog some cool things, tips, and other generally useless information that might seem to make the work day go by a bit faster.
