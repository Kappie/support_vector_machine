Still looking for a job so I can get on with my life. Last interview I had fell through after managing to get the third and final interview. Oh well, no biggie though. I figure it wasn't a good sign that after 3 interviews I  still  had no idea what the job entailed...exactly. I know it had to deal with working with a small team...something or another with computers...and there might be overtime involved. But the rest was a mystery to me...really it was. Sad really since I said that "The job sounds very interesting and something I could see myself enjoying" or something like that in two separate interviews. Ahhh, the price we must pay to actualize our view of the American dream. But at least I didn't lie on my resume....no...really...I didn't....look it up....embellishing is  not  lying...technically.  My friends that I'm staying with are out of town so I have the whole house to myself. And after a few hours of running around the house naked, I've learned that cats actually can scream in terror. So rather than traumatize them further, the clothes are back on. Just can't seem to catch a break anywhere nowadays. But all is not lost. I can watch whatever on TV that I feel like watching instead of fighting the little one for the remote so he can watch the fifth episode of Dora for the day. For those of you who don't know who Dora is, consider yourself lucky. Now, don't get me wrong. I have nothing against most kid shows in general. I've been known to enjoy them from my toddler days into my mid-twenties ('dem teletubbie folks were just sooooo demented that I couldn't turn away). But after watching them for 3-4 straight hours day in and day out, the shit starts to get to you. Even with my vast movie collection, I find myself looking at them all (and there's a lot of them to look at) and saying "I don't feel like watching  any  of this crap."  Guess I'll leave on that note. Seems like I'm just complaining at this point. Maybe I'll find a job right up my alley tomorrow. Something like "Fortune 500 company seeking a senior level slacker. Must have experience in avoiding work like the plague and able to disseminate any work attained to underlings who have no idea what they are doing." Yeah. That would be sweet. But my last 2 jobs were like that so I think my luck is running out.
