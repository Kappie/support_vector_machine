I thought it'd be nice to have a cruise on my bike.  I took it down a bike path to Didcot which is one of the more fiscally challenged towns about.  Similar to Springfield in the simpsons with it's MASSIVE reactors for making electricity [coal though, not nuclear].  It's about a 4 mile journey each way.  I think I took a wrong turn on the bike path and managed to go straight to the local tip which was NEXT  to the power plant.  MMmm. What a pretty site it was.  Next time I'll take my camera I think.  I'm sure I can get photoes on this webt site.  I'll try and update it regularly.  So after my ride I joinged my flat mates and some friends at our local pub, the White Horse for a quick pint before it was decided that the weather was good enough for a barbeque [bbq].  So 8 of us got together got some burgers and atlantic salmon and proceeded to drink and eat late into the evening.  And on a school as well!!  School's out for Summer Baby.  Alice Cooper, eat your f*cking heart out.
