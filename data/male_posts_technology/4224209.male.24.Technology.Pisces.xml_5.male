I've rejoined my old work place after a 2 year absence and things have definitely changed for the best. Most importantly the company name has changed to something that sounded alot better than before! Jokes aside there have been some institutional improvements and it's a very exciting time to be in the company. I can see myself being there for alot longer than I initially thought I would be. The first two days were a little slow, but thats expected, by Wednesday I was already jetting off to Southampton! I've been assigned to an interesting project which I'm not really allowed to talk about ;)  Ive got Thursdays and Fridays off until the 6th September to do my dissertation which frankly hasn't taken much shape. To my relief I was talking to a few of my mates and it seems as though they are in pretty much the same position which relieves me for some reason but doesn't help my position in anyway! I aim to have a big chunk of it done before the weekend finishes.
