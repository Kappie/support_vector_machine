Got, Grave of the Fireflies, for my bday, still need to watch it.  It's about midnight on sunday night/monday morning, and I just got done watching "snatch" in my room with big A. Now kevin is playing GT3. Over the past couple of days I've gotten, SSX Tricky, THPS3, Devil May Cry, and Spyhunter. Talk about being busy. I think we need more PS2's in the house:)  Also, I haven't heard from Brad, so I need to call him. Also, I finally got the games from the amazon. Those bitches. I'm watching some ifilms, right now, they're way funny.  Also, I just wanted to talk about how I love women. and how i do not understand them. But I think I've already talked about those two before, so I won't bore you. And another thing, Weezer is gonna rock....
