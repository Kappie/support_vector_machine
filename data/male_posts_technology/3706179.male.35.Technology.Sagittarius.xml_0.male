Not cuz I have any readership, but because it's good exercise. I did really want to be a writer when I grew up, but I discovered I kinda sucked at it. I never got past my writing sounding very pompous to my own ears, and so I kind of dropped any creative-writing exercises.  I still like writing. It's a bit like cerebral masturbation. It feels good to touch these parts of my brain on a regular basis again. Yeah yeah, TMI, I know.  More on why I'm doing a blog. Briefly. These 2 were kind of my inspiration:  http://www.wilwheaton.net http://www.internettime.com/blog/index.html  Wil Wheaton dot net? you might ask. Yes, I might reply. I never thought the guy who played Wesley Crusher would inspire me to anything, except maybe murder. I was wrong, and the central issue with that is that Wil is the guy who *played* Wesley. He isn't Wesley, although he really seems to be the best kind of modern nerd.  The other one is by a guy name Jay Cross. If you aren't into education or, specifically, e-learning, you might never have heard of him. I am into education and, specifically, e-learning, and this guy is the MAN. Trust me on that.  Short post, I said. I think someone ran the /v switch on me at birth.  Ciao for now
