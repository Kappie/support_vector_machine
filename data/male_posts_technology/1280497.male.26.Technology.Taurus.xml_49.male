Julie was nice enough to help me today with the first resolution I have listed below; namely, the resolution to eat more fruit. She did this by placing all the fruit we have in a huge platter-bowl thing. She said, "I think this will help you eat more fruit because you'll see it easier."  I said, "Yeah, I think that's probably true." The fruit looked good, grouped in a nice platter-bowl thing and all, and it made me think of food. I opened the fridge and got a Coke out.  Julie said, "Maybe I'll put the Coke all together in a bowl for you."  I said, "Yeah, that would be nice." I opened the can and drank about two ounces, put it in the fridge, and closed the door. Then I picked up an apple and took a bite. A little soft, but a nice tasting piece of fruit, nonetheless. After I finished it, we had dinner, and I finished the Coke then. I bet you anything that I really will eat more fruit, even though I generally like it more if it's cold.
