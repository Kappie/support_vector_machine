I got news...I ain't paying nothing. %$#^!!  Busy day.  1)  my garage door is broken I have to come up with $600 to fix it.  2)  No news on fixing my car from accident a couple weeks before I started this.  3)  Have to come up with $1200 for hawaii trip #1, $5000 for Hawaii trip #2.  4)  Can't sign my equity loan papers.  Wells Fargo won't let me "power of Attorney" my wifes name.    Work is going well.  I like it here still.  I feel like I'm respected again.  That's all for now.
