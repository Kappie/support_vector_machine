I walked and scored from first when mat doubled, but the game went downhill when Eric got rocked for like 12 runs in the third.  It was really hot.  I caught, but made Darryl catch the fourth.  When I came back in the fifth the umpire thanked me.  I am glad to see I am not the only one bothered by his lack of talent behind the plate.  The funniest moment actually happened prior to the game starting.  A car pulled up and the guy inside asked if this was a semi-pro league.  I said no and he asked if he could play.  We only had eight at the time and I said sure.  He proceeded to step out of his car with no shirt and bright purple baseball pants with yellow pin stripes.  I don't know if I was more distracted by the pants or the bling around his neck.  He wrote down his number and said to call him if we didn't have nine by game time.  His name?  Kojack!  I got to watch Chris Burke play in the Futures All-Star game tonight.  Not bad when Peter Gammons is using your scouting report on a pitcher in the first inning.
