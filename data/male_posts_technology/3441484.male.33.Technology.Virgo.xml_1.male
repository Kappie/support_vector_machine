They had a huge wedding in the mall, and Tom was expecting a ton of people. However, that never happened, so I basically went in for nothing!  We might take Amanda driving after we eat. Not sure if I am really ready to do this or not. It means that she is growing up, and I definitely do not want that to happen! Can't stop it though, but that doesn't mean I have to like it!
