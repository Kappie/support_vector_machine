With all due respect to the deceased I have to say that it's completely ridiculous to even contemplate holding a "ceremony" at the beginning of an international football match simply because somebody who enjoyed football was murdered whilst on a football holiday. At least UEFA have shown some sanity but no doubt they will be criticised for it. And the England team will all wear black armbands tonight. Like they're in mourning. Yeah right.
