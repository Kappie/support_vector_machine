We have a live scheduled (hospital going up on a newer version of Lab system) next Monday. We been busting our butt's testing and trying to get this up and running. We finally been able to get the Micro's to display in the order screen. Man it was a booger. I will be glad when this live is over.   Kelli didn’t have much of a better one; she had to watch our 2 kids, plus our friends 2 kids most of the day after Vacation Bible School. In addition she taught Pre-K Vacation Bible School. I hadn’t had much time to talk to her but she said there were 2 devil spawned children in her class already. :   )  I didn't get into bed last night till 1 a.m. We made it to bed 15 minutes till midnight. I missed DeadZone! Ahh man, I caught the last 15 minutes of it by luck. I will try to watch the repeat Tuesday at 11 p.m. (Yes, I checked out  urlLink TV Guide.Com  for it. I see next Sunday they will spill the beans on his son. I tell you  urlLink Nixon ; I bet she is pregnant again.  Since I couldn’t get to sleep at midnight and it was too late to take Tylenol p.m.'s  : (   I found Farscape on  urlLink Scifi . So I got to watch Farscape, which it has been a long time, so that was cool.   The kids slept in the living room last night, around 12:30 a.m. (during a commercial) I went to check on them and my son was on the floor. I guess he fell off the couch. I put him on the smaller one.   I called my parents tonight and both were in a weird mood. I called my Dad and his mood was 'why don't you come over and visit me sometimes.' This from the guy that's been to my house maybe 5 times in the last 6 months. Seems he went to my brother’s house on a cookout and no-one to talk too. My brother kept himself busy and didn’t have time to converse.   My mom's deal was different. I called and talked to her and then she called me back about 30 minutes later. I guess she was lonely. I don't know. I don't have much of a relationship with them since I have a family of my own. It may sound crude. But realistically, if I don't call them, I wouldn’t have much contact from them, and it's not like we live that far apart either.    My poor wife. She has to work this evening. Fortunately, she can do alot of her paralegal work here at home, in the office. But it's a shame to be nearly 9 p.m. and non-stop.  For those thinking 'get off your butt and help!' I already asked. I don't have a clue of that stuff and I managed to vacuum, clean the remaining of the house. :  )
