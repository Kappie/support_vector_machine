To date not one Dem had given a speach denouncing the murders, but 45 times spoke against prison abuse.  Kevin    Rep. Mark Foley, Florida Republican, yesterday called on his Democratic colleagues to end their silence on the beheadings of American civilians Nick Berg and Paul M. Johnson Jr. and show the same outrage they showed in the wake of the Abu Ghraib prison incidents.      Mr. Foley, in a floor speech, said no Democratic member of Congress has spoken on the floor of the House about the cruel slaying of Mr. Johnson, yet more then 20 Democratic members have mentioned Abu Ghraib more than 45 times since April.      "Mr. Chairman, I stand here amazed and disappointed in the self-righteous, politically motivated diatribes coming from the other side about Abu Ghraib," Mr. Foley said, adding, "But, what I find especially appalling is the near-deafening silence from the other side following the savage beheadings of American civilians Nick Berg and Paul Johnson."
