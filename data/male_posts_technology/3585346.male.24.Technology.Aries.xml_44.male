What is the fucking damn hurry in the damn carpark, can't he let the kitten and the cats cross the damn road before he drive over them.  FUCK him!  *Below is not advisable for the weak hearted*  Ok enough of swearing, it's useless anyway. I was like preparing to go to fetch my mum from work. While I warming up the car, i saw this small cute kitten trying to cross the road as the kitten parent is almost over the other side.  I still wanted to go down to play with the kitten while warming my car up because it is so damn cute. And GUESS WHAT? The next moment....WHAM! And the poor innocent black kitten was run over and trampled by the school bus driven by a bastard. At that moment, the adult cat was trying to save it but too late....Next moment i saw this kitten wriggling and using the muscle reflaxes to hop around and blood was splurting all over the area around the kitten. It is in god damn pain and after 20 secs of struggling and twitching. Everything is over for the small kitten. (While I am typing this I still can remember the truma event clearly..I feel a bit agitated about the bus driver) The brain juice ooze out from the left eye of the kitten as the eye is no where to be seen but flesh and brain juice. The blood that splurting around while it struggling is all over (around 60cm diameter) with mince pieces of flesh or brain all over with the blood. It is a mess! A total disgusting horror scene. The adult cat moaning by the side of the lifeless carcass. Two of them staring at the dead kitten and whining. The kind of helplessness ..... I was at a moment of lost. By this time some neighbour saw the left over mess and feel disgusted. I carefully drive by the side of the carcass to examine the horror scene to proof what i though is true. It is lifeless....No heartbeat but blood still flowing all over through out from the eyes and body. I drive over ask the security to get the cleaner to clean up the mess as I do not want the carcass to be in more worse condition.  There is no hurry in the damn car park there is no damn car behind the bus. WHY the damn FUCK the bus driver got to run over it when it is so obvious there is two adult cats and one kitten trying to cross the damn bloody small drive way of the car park.  Can you imagine it again. You were on the way down from your car seat to pick up the kitten and the damn blardy bus just wham over it. I should have reacted faster...i could have save the kitten.......but I also never realise the bus coming....Imaging the twitch is so powerful that it is able to twitch and hop in the air using the stomach muscle. The kind of immense pain is horrible. So guy driving out there, becareful you will not want to run over human in this manner. I mean if it is on the expressway or roads out there kitten or cats or dogs is a no choice but to wham it and kill it but WHAT THE FUCK? It is in the carpark drive way where speed limit is 25kmph.  Ok When i reach home, I still see the patch of blood stain left over. Is just in front of the porch at my block. The kitten is barely two months old. Ok enough i feel so tensed up while typing this..  Anyway I have to draw out some time chart and plans to get a new project going on. Two jobs in the evening tomorrow and party time! It is my buddy's house warming! Just loaded 7 cartons of drinks from my family coffee shop to his house yesterday.   May the spirit of the kitten rest in peace. I will pray for you.
