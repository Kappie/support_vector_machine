Elements in sense of the feeling of the whole song, the meaning of the lyrics and how u would want to express urself in a song. We were given a simple tune and asked to become, 1.lyricist, 2.MTV Director for the song and 3.Singer. the tune goes like this:    Do Re Mi   Do Re Mi                                           Do Re Mi   Do Do                                           Do Re Mi   Do Re Mi                                           Do Re Mi   Do Do                                                                                  Do Ti La So   Do Ti La So                                           So Fa Mi Re   Do Re Mi                                           Do Ti La So   Do Ti La So                                           So Fa Mi Re   Do Do Its a very simple and nice tune when played wif musical instruments. And we were given a week to complete the Assignment and have to present it during next lesson. This is my lyrics, written when i was thinking of her, missing her. It goes like this:                                           tian hen hei   Feng hen ji                                           chuang wai hai xia    ze yu                                           xian zai ni   zai na li                                           wo zhen de xiang    zhe ni                                            wo nao hai li   quan dou shi ni                                           mei tian mei ye    zai xiang ni                                           xiang gao shu ni   que mei yong qi                                           wo zhen de hen    ai ni      haha it sounds funny though when u sing it out without music support. But thats all i can think of. Two of my classmates wrote about school and another one wrote about being cheated by someone she loved. well, when writing lyrics, ppl always put in wat is on their mind at that very moment as one of my classmate who wrote about school had actually jus finished his exams. And he wrote something about the feeling when waiting for results to be posted. I told her about the assignment and actually wanted to sing it to her and ask her how it sounds but in the end i didnt. Didnt dare to and it sounds so awful also but strangely when i presented it and sing with her in my mind, it was the best song ever.....haha -_-" cos if u want to be a good singer, u will have to inject feelings into songs. thats wat the assignment was for, to help us notice it. So, lesson for those who wants to know more about singing, there u go. Do some homework and study the song lyrics and try to feel wat the lyricist feel when he/she was writing the song and inject that feeling into the song and it will sound very good. not like in ktv where u jus read and follow the word without feeling one.....lesson learned??  Cheers, Teddy, the silly singing bear -_-"
