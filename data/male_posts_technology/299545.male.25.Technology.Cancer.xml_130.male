But the question remains, is it funny or not?"  And Godel thinks for a moment and says, "Well, because we're inside the joke, we can't tell whether it's funny. We'd have to be outside looking at it."  And Chomsky looks at both of them and says, "Of course it's funny. You're just telling it wrong."     these jokes  definitely made me laugh out loud. I can't believe I am such a dork.
