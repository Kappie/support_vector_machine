I plan on coming back a nightearly soI can make my baseball double header on Sunday. It will be the 5th and 6th times weplay C White Tile this year. We played them last week and you notice I did not write about it. It was that bad. First off we showed up with 7. Might as well call us the Generals again. Second we got blown out. I went 0-2 and Darryl and Matt had a screaming match in the dug out. Ahhh.   So anyway, we are going camping. I am not really a camping person. Well, I might be a camping person, but I have never really done it. I remember a cub scout camp out where I stayed with Dara, Tyler and Travis. That was a long time ago. In fact I think I went to a whole week of cub scout camp. I don't remember much. It was at Tom Sawyer Park and it was hot. I think I may have made a pocket knife holder out of leather. See, I told you I am not much of a camping person. I can't remember my one week of cub scout camp, but can tell you about every baseball team I have ever played on. Hopefully, I can get some good pictures for the site. I am not really sure what else you do when camping. Cook stuff? Look for arrowheads? Make leather goods? Guess you'll have to stay tuned to the moBlog to find out...they do have internet access, right?
