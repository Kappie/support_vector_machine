Believe me when I tell you, I am lucky to be alive. I was probably inches away from joining Johnny Cash and John Ritter in the waiting line to the afterlife.  I'm not exactly sure how I survived with only minor injuries, but you better believe I am playing the lottery this week. :)  Cya guys later.
