No, just a wild stab in the dark, which incidently is what you'll be getting if you don't shut up and tell me where she is.  My holiday was lovely. Best bit was when we took a yacht, found a deserted bay and went swimming - fantastic! Piccies back on Thursday so I'll post a few at the weekend or somethin'. Exams: blugh. 'nuff said.
