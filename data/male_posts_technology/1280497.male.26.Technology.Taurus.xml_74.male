I consider it okay if people make money from their weblogs, because that's sort of a natural result of something being good and popular. The point at which I become a little less clear is when a weblog exists because a company is paying someone to keep it, and it exists to make a profit.   I'm thinking of the "Unofficial ________ Weblog" set of blogs out there, of which  urlLink The Unofficial Google Weblog  is one. On the one hand, it seems to run somewhat counter to my idea of the blog as a highly individualistic tool that is not beholden to corporate pressure. On the other hand, there is the fact that plenty of weblogs are beholden to various pressures, and I should not be so naive as to think that every blog out there is some devoted volunteer that happens to have hours of spare time and little ambition to be rich.  So as I am writing this post, I am trying to think of what makes the Unofficial ______ Weblogs less attractive to me than they would be if they were individually run. For me, the key to it is in the word "individual". These blogs, while they may be run by very smart people, and though they might cover a variety of subjects, seem to come up lacking. Namely, they lack a special allure of the unknown--the totally unique!--that makes me addicted to not just a select few blogs that I have bookmarked, but addicted to random weblogging. The run-of-the-mill weblog is less a blog to me, and more an information site, because the blogger isn't there, in my opinion.  That doesn't mean I'm going to stop reading the blogs that are produced in this way. It just makes me realize (and appreciate more, I hope) that the thing I love about blogs is the people behind the blogs. No disrespect to those who (mass-)produce these types of identical blogs; it seems too bad that anyone would not be given free reign to say whatever they wanted to say about a given subject, as the author of the blog. Maybe that's not the case, but if there becomes a network of blogs published by one company, you can bet these will lack some of the grittiness and reckless abandon that gives a blog its flavor.   Update: Compare  urlLink Google Blogoscoped  to the Unofficial Google Weblog. It seems that while The Unofficial..."stays on task" better than the others, Google Blogoscoped has more personality. It's Leno vs. Conan, and I know you don't have to ask which one has the personality....
