GRRRRRR..... I've got such a mountain of continually backed up schoolwork that keeps gettign added to every day. I can't cope with this... I feel like just taking a break from sanity for a while. Anyone wanna come with me? (lol)  In other news, it's about 2,614 steps from Josh M's front door to my front door. I know this because I was bored, so I ran to his house and back earlier tonight. Took a bit, but was refreshing.  HBOK my life pisses me off... actually, my life depresses me, what pisses me off is my lack of ability to do anything about my life slowly deteriorating before my eyes.
