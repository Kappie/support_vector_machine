Turns out that Verizon (from whom I receive me service) only allows their canned CGI scripts on 'home' accounts.  I'll have to get a 'business' account if I want to use custom CGI.  So, no comments for now.  Though I want to add it in the future.  I believe that what you have to say about what I write can be an interesting addition to the artifact.  I'll look into what it would take to switch to a business account.
