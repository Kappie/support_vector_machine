Speaking of which we have got a group of us charting a boat to go deep sea fishing on sunday. Going to catch a big barracuda! Also been out on Jet skis yesterday.. EXCELLENT fun!  MTV were at the same club as us yesterday doing a spring break feature. Kylie Minogue was here on the day we arrived and tomorrow Paul Van Dyke is playing at the club next door to our resort. They play a wierd blend of music out here though. Last night at Fat Tuesdays they played Vanilla Ice, Guns N Roses, then Puffy Daddy. When the guys are pulling the girls, they pretty much just go right up to them and grab them and start grinding into them. If you did that in Follies you would likely have a glass in the face. Oh yeah, Americans cannot dance for SHIT :-)
