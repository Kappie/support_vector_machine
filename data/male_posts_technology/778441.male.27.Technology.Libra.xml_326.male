Read it!!... if you haven't done so already!!   Part 1 :   urlLink Before the whining drowns it out, listen to the new India  And guess what the average age is in the industry? Just 26 and a half! These 26/27-year-olds have changed the world’s perception of India. It’s not just a country of snake-charmers, it’s a country against which protectionist walls have to be erected. Of course, we can also charm snakes.   Part 2 :   urlLink When sky is the limit  The point is the successes we have encountered above are not fortuitous. India has a score of strengths that others do not.  Cost is one of them. Nor is it a marginal advantage. Indeed, the difference between the cost at which we can provide services and many commodities of comparable quality and what those cost in the developed world is so vast that, should those firms and economies shut themselves out from our supplies, they are the ones who will be severely disadvantaged, they are the ones who will be making themselves un-competitive.   Part 3 :   urlLink This is India's moment but it's onle a moment, can we grasp it?   So we have many things working for us. In many ways, this is India’s moment, even vis a vis China. For the first time, observers have begun to voice questions in public about China—its statistics; the fact, for instance, as a German investor said recently at a conference I was deputed to attend, that, ‘‘If you want your factory to come up quickly, go to China; if you want to make money, go to India.’’ On the other side, everyone’s noticing Indians make a mark in every sphere: writers, scientists, doctors, IT, cricket, beauty pageants, chess...  So it is the moment for India. It is a moment. But, it is only a moment. What should we do to ensure we grasp it?
