This is where I graduated last December.  Very beautiful chapel.  We paid for it and it's set for 3pm on 6/26/2004.  2. The dress is paid for.  She chose it from David's Bridal and I still haven't seen it.  I know, I know, traditions.  3. Christie has been shopping around for a florist and has pretty much settled for Floral Elegance, a florist her sister Elaine suggested. Christie met with them and was impressed with their professionalism and their quality.  I asked her for a price and we're going to be paying them with my next paycheck.  4. The cake, decorations, and photographer are still up in the air.  We have ideas, and will be finalizing them as soon as possible.  Christie has accomplished what she wanted to start before school starts again this fall.  She is going back full time at Northwest Vista College, a local community college.  Still pursuing the Psychology degree.  We're doing good, had a few shaky days about a week ago, but God has a plan for us and we are positive it is for us to do it together.  I'll write again soon.
