Dan and I were riding in my Mom’s old 1971 WV Bug, the 7-toned yellow one.    We were driving on the coast on an old, tiny, narrow road with very sharp corners, so sharp the Bug could not stay on the road.    The road turns a very sharp corner, and I calmly realize there is no way.    Dan (who is slightly older, perhaps 13) says “uh, DAD, LOOK OUT!!”, but too late as the wheels are already over the edge, driver’s side first, starting to nose down into the cove.       Falling - we are about 50 feet above the clear blue water, waves gently breaking on the rocky shore.    Time has stretched out in that dreamy way, giving us plenty of time to shift our weight backward and bring up the nose so the car is nearly flat by the time it hits the water.    There is time to look at the beautiful section of coast, the birds, the clouds, the slowly approaching water, as we fall.    As we are about 10 feet from the water, I am thinking, “VWs can float for a minute or two, so we will have time to –”       Suddenly time accelerates to about 125%, freaky fast, not quite fast forward.    The car immediately fills with water as we plunge below the surface, drifting quickly downward.    There is no time for either of us to breathe, or to warn Dan.    He is struggling to unlatch the (stupid VW) seatbelt, open the door, roll the window down, do something to escape, but he is running out of time.    In the meantime, I sit and do nothing, watching him without helping, while I idly fiddle with the rounded, black door-lock lever.    My lungs are imploding, but I don’t feel it or care.    Just before I breathe in the water, just before we both drown, I go black ... and wake up.
