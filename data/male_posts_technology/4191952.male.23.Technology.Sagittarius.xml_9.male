Any day now I'm going to buy a kashmir sweater and start hanging out in the little girls section at J.C. Penny. "Would you like some candy little girl? No? How about your...oh God, stop kicking me."  Ok, maybe not, that kind of stuff kinda makes my stomach ache. My contacts are old and hurt my eyes so I'm forced to wear my glasses...this only adds the english teacher look that I'm afraid of...next I'm going to start correcting peoples pronunciations of words and then end up get my ass kicked by a mechanic named Hector.  Seriously, if you're still reading at this point, you're either a heroin addict or more bored than I.  Anyways...I washed the protective gel out of my hair earlier at lunch when I went to see my girlfriend...I sometimes to that so we can lounge on the couch...anyhow...Now I'm back at work and the helmet-like firmness is gone and I'm sporting somewhat of an afro, but a crappy white guy one like the drummer from the Jimi Hendrix's experience. It itches and I want so badly to have it cut, but since I spend lunch snuggling, I'm going to have to act like I'm somewhere working on a computer while Heather, the one I like cutting my hair, does her job.  Well, I guess I'm off now...I'm sure there'll be another witless and worthless rant posted by motherfucking me later on...tootles.
