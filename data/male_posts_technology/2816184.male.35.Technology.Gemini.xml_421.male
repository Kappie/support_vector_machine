The world is starved of love and kindness, and it turns forlornly on a rusty axel forged by man's treachery and greed. Your assignment here on Earth is to teach the values of true, unconditional love and to reach out to those with no-one else to turn to. Your heart is immeasurable in its compassion and pain for the human race. Everywhere you see death and poverty, evil and despair, and your Angel heart feels at the point of breaking. You're so willing to love and blossom in the love of another, but beware. There are those who will wrecklessly play with your fragile emotions and take advantage of you. Don't let them. Surround yourself with people you know you can completely trust, and let your inner light shine.    urlLink   Which Earth Angel Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
