After which we headed down to Madam Wong , it was my first time there. Well what can I say, clubbing is definitely not for me. The music was pretty ok at first , they were playing hip hop/r and b songs like 50 cents and beyonce but then it degenerated to Bon Jovi and Linkin Park and then to godawful techo shit.  So I stood at the side leaning against the wall with a beer bottle in my hand, trying to look as cool as possible. That didn't really come off.
