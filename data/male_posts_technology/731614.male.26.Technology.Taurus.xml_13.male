Haven't you all ever found it strange her neighbor is a panda, and she is always surrounded by goldfish, and the only stars she talks about are the ones that are all dried up and have nothing to do with their time but go to the zoo and moan to the monkeys about their washed up life?. HHMMM.  The research is proving to be a success, for she can form sentences and type and log on and off the internet.  Soon the world will be overrun by the cloned monkey population and we can all say we knew the first one.
