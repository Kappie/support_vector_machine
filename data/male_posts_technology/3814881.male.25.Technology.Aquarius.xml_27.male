"He put the bottle to his head and pulled the trigger".  He ends the first chorus with recounting the funeral under the Willow Tree, where the angels show up to sing their Whiskey Lullaby.    And if you wondered what that sounded like, an angel shows up to sing one in the next verse.  By "angel" I mean Allison Krauss.  Not much difference, at least musically.  There has never been a song that she's sung that didn't make you want to stare out the window.    And what's even better, she's teamed up with Jerry Douglas, my new favorite guitar player.  He's in the background on WL, whipping out some solemn and profound licks.  It took a few weeks of eating up his work to get him to number one status, but there it is.  Jerry Garcia, Trey Anastasio, Steve Kimock, step aside.  He's got all the technical ability you could want, always brings out the melody, and is country through and through.  And he doesn't even play a guitar, but a Dobro.
