Thinking of going to watch him; ok I haven't heard a lot of his music to be honest, but this was the guy who inspired Manson's Mechanical Animals so thats really something. I am already downloading some of his old stuff to listen to.  Anyone else interested in going ?   OK and also A Perfect Circle is going to be performing in Perth the end of February. I really really wanna go see them, and maybe at the same time take a holiday too there.  But looking for someone to go as well ! But the thing is I don't know that many people who are into A Perfect Circle. It really sucks how no decent bands come to Singapore.
