Got tat outta ma system now I can calm down abit. Right right. I've just bought a load of books in a shop in caterham, cos I am gonna try and learn some Spanish before I go on holiday. I bought one of those CD-rom teaching type thingys this morning, but it doens' tell you the alphabet or the numbers or anything as basic as that, so I just went and got an everyday phrase book (typical touristy thing) and a voccab tool book. Whilst I was there I als found the last book in a series of superb books that I have read, and I bought a german phrase book for my trip to Austria with the music department! Das ist kaputt.Look at this:  "Eine Ruckfahrkarte erster Paris, bitte" how silly is that? Aking for a train ticket to a place in france, in german. Right. And don't say you can get a train from Germany to PAris, it is a bloody long way and would be a bit silly to do! Spiegeleier mit Zuckererbsen, bitte. Ha ha ha!!Die nummer funktioniert nicht. Ich habe verstopfung!! Ooooh!! I bet you canm guess that last one just by looking at the last word 'verstopfung! Achtung vor dem Hund!!! Mquah ha ha ha. OKay, I'm sorry, I'll shut up. It's just that, well, um, you see............. FREDDIE PRINCE Jnr!!!! and of course, for Nicki- CHRIS KLEIN!!!
