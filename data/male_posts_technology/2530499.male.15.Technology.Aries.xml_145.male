Right now, I just feel like writing, so I'll probably just have some long elaborate post in general. Well, we got home around 8:00 because that's when the rain let up. We got everything into Blake's Jeep, and it was all soaking. We pulled it all out, organized it...and Joel walked over to his Dad's house. You know what bothers me? Since Dumpster is a brand name, you have to capatilize it...like Dumpster. Like saying Kleenex or Xerox. Dumpster. He walked around to the back of the building and threw the trash into the Dumpster and left. It's just crazy. Anyways, we got to Blake's and cleaned up and ate and watched some gay-ass show on MTV about a fat chick who thought she could be black. Got my stuff together and Blake dropped me off. Slept. For six hours. I didn't sleep more than thirty minutes all night, no joke. So, then I got up around 4:30 and put my clothes in the dryer. I got dinner started. It was some goooood Durkee's (that's hot sauce) chicken, you just baste the chicken in the durkee's and slap it in the oven for 35 minutes at 325 degrees and it comes out real nice. I did have to use meat tenderizer on it because it was frozen chicken, but wasn't bad in the end. So, we got to the campground yesterday, and my dad said that it was gonna rain all day yesterday, suprise, it STOPPED until around seven, so we got in the tent and got online, I got to talk to  urlLink Kelly!  online, she's always kickass fun to talk to and such, but I guess she was having problems with AIM. (no suprise there.) Y'know what's funny? Windows is so insecure because it's closed-source. Linux is so secure because it's OPEN-SOURCE. SSL encryption? Almost impossible to hack, and it's roots are open source. How about that? The most secure things are open. Crazy. Anyways, we talked and shit until about nine, nine thirty, and then we went outside. We were on South Bay, and man, I said, "Damn...Looks like we got nuked!" and then Joel saw some headlights and was all, "Look! It's the Russians, they're surveying the damage!" and then, we hung out in the gravel parking area and this guy pulled up in a Saturn. Here's how the conversation went:  Me: "Hey, how you doing?" Him: "Oh, not bad, you know, a little wet, but can't complain." Me:  Points at campground post  "Is this your grounds?" Him: "Yup." Me: "Nice." Joel:  Points at something  "What's that?"  Anyways, we walk back over to our tent and we're just chillin' outside. I look over, and he's pitching his tent in complete darkness, maybe 13% exposure total light. I ask, "Hey, you need a lantern, man?" and he says, "Naw, I've done this plenty of times in the dark. Thanks, though." Then, we all got back in our tent and just talked until Blake and Joel fell asleep. I stayed up, closed my eyes, thought about: -School! -Kelly! -Jacque and Moving Day! -Movies! - urlLink FCAL!  -People and Things in general!  Then, around five or so in the morning, I hear the guy get out and start to take down his tent, once again in pure darkness, maybe 7% exposure. I go outside, because I had to piss like a pregnant woman... Anyways, we all got up around seven and started to clean up and talk and shit. All things considered, we had a really awesome time, and we're gonna go up again at least twice before summer is over. Anyways, nice to keep you all in the know, and by the way, it's really fun to type "a href="http://fcal.netfirms.com"FCAL!"/a" at a blazing 47 WPM. My mommie, the Office Manager at Allnutt, types over 100 WPM, sometimes the keyboard on the typewriter jams there, and it's really pretty funny. Anyways, lates for now. Hmm... I've been saying "Lates!" instead of "Later." ever since Counter-Strike. I don't even play CS anymore anyways. Lates!
