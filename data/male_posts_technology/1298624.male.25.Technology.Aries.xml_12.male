Expending all that energy on exercise probably made my body go through changes that it couldn't handle (cause I didn't have the right vitamins or didn't eat the right foods). I should've thought of that...but I can start right away.   On another note, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is only $37.99 at Frys today!!! It's only for Xbox...but I'm thinking about getting it. Not a bad price! I need to catch up on buying games anyways, since I've *cough* borrowed *cough* a lot of copies from my source. Time to give something back, you know? It's bad for your karma if you pirate games for so long without giving back to the community.
