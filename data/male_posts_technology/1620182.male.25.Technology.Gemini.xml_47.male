My take on the issue?  The ACC has screwed itself.  Look at the current state of ACC football plus its three incoming teams.  Of its original nine teams, it has one (that's one) in the top 25.  Granted, Florida State is third overall in the BCS standing, but who honestly thinks they belong there?  NC State, Maryland, and UVA have all had disappointing seasons this year, and the remaining five ACC schools are border-line pathetic.  Actually, Duke and UNC not only cross that line, but have redefined it with their abysmal play.
 
 Miami and Virginia Tech even these standings out a bit, each landing in the top six of the BCS.  But are they are really the powerhouses that everyone expects to arrive next year.?  No.  They are not.  Witness West Virginia absolutely destroying Virginia Tech in all ways last Wednesday night (and I mean absolutely in every way).  Witness Virginia Tech crushing Miami.  Did either of these teams look like a top calibur team during those games?  No, they did not.  Neither had an offense to speak of.  Neither could keep from making stupid mistakes.
 
 So we have these two new teams joining the conference next year with Boston College joining the next.  None of these three teams are the dominant programs which the ACC thought they were getting.  Florida State has been hanging on to their history by a thread the past few years, and I fully expect that thread to break once Bowden retires (and you know it's going to happen soon).  NC State, Maryland, and Virginia seem destined to remain mediocre at best.  Basically, the ACC is now just a much larger conference full of average teams.
 
 The worst part of all this is that the ACC basically plucked the worst basketball teams from the Big East and watered down one of the better basketball conferences.  The Big East, meanwhile, has picked up four new basketball programs that will easily make it the best conference in the country.  So the ACC now has a big and average basketball conference and a big and average football conference.  Hmmm, I hope that conference championship game pays for all of these mistakes...
