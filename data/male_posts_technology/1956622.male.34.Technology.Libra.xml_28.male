She and I talked for a bit nothing really special again as she won't let me really talk to her anymore.  I did tell her how I liked talking to her and she is my most favorite person to talk to.  I know not the best english but she understands it.  She told me I love you about 10 times and said she missed me then hung up on me.  I was not done with my sentence and she hung up.  I am a little miffed that Lisa cannot take more responsibility in making sure Karissa at least uses proper etiquette when talking on the phone...like not hanging up on people.  I am sure she has seen Lisa do it enough that it is nothing for Karissa to do it and Lisa probably would not even notice it even if she did know it was not appropriate as that is Lisa's way of solving her phone disputes.
