Every now and then my hip hurts like crazy, especially during the winter. Dang especially when I had the metal plate inside, screwed to my bone. That was crazy. I think working out in the "extreme" outdoors, lifting heavy equipment on uneven lands has put a hurt to my hip, just a little. Not so much, but it hurt's whenever I go like this... Yea, just like that.  Well I started the day at 5:30. I fed the livestock, showered, oh and loaded up my aunt's PC(finally finished that job). I went down to the office...walked to the store for coffee and cigarettes(damn, I bought another pack), and waited. Everyone came back from the MCU office(ExxonMobil), jobs were described and handed out. I(we) had an easy one...well there wasn't much a couple of us could do because the truck we use is in the shop getting fixed, something about faulty electrical system...oh, yea, my job was to go out with "birdman" and load up a huge Flange, like 800 lbs or so. I drove(at times jumping/hopping) the back-hoe from the CO2 plant down to the pipe yard, connected all that needed to be, and *beep beep*, it was loaded.  I then got dropped off at the office after everything was ready to go. What we loaded was taken to NM for coating, extra protection on the flange and other pipe that went along. So I stayed at the yard, then left, gassed up...bought a soda...and came back. After I got back, I went down to the corral because my uncle was down there welding. I helped a bit, grinded here and there and lo and behold it was done...a new gate. Not sure what happened to the other one. It looked good to me.  Speaking of welding, I went to my cousin's brother's place(they have different mothers, same father) Sunday evening...I got there and they were welding :D. They made a top shade for the horses. It's not complete...still need the other half. Anywho, I helped with their project. Broke out my math, measured, cut, remeasured, and finally grinded. I didn't do any of the welding there because...well it's not my corral or project. So all I did was cut pieces of metal with the torch. Afterwards we chilled for a bit, had a can, and said "well I'm gonna head out now..." "Alright then, thanks for your help, good to see you again.." was all I heard.  One day I'm going to do a lot with my acquired welding/cutting skills. Just need to learn to shape sheet metal now, then I'm all set. :D Yeppers. Hmm..As I mentioned before sometime ago, I type all my entries beforehand on WordPad before I actually publish whatever it is I write. And right now...I don't have much else to write about...so, I'm going to post this entry now...oh yea, I just found out that I'm lacking one course to obtain a minor in Probability and Statistics. Wish I could say that for Mathematics(both for a major and minor), but dang them upper division courses look tough..Bout 20 credits is all I need of them.
