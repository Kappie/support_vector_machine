(1 Jn 3:1) and also, Jesus replied, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.  This is the first and greatest commandment.  And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'" I had read verses like these since before I can remember, "God loves you," was always heard around my house and my church.  I was taught the whole "love is a verb" and not "an overheated passion" thing, but I guess I never really understood honestly what that was all about - I mean, I suppose that I accepted that God loved me like the way I accepted that McDonald's has billions and billions sold (and no, I never went and saw Mel's The Passion of the Christ, but yes, I know Jesus died on a cross for me).  So, I guess I missed the Sunday School lesson where they taught what love actually is (aside from "you'll just know when you're in love" which is honestly no help at all), so I decided that if I thought I loved her, then I'd better bloody well know what I was getting into before I told her.  Lo and behold, I found this: Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.  It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.  Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth.  It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. (1 Co 13:4-7) How awesome is that?! As surely as I breath, I would want to love and be loved like that.  I now know what God is acting like when He says He loves me.  I now know how I am supposed to love Him, and love others, including her.  So, while I'm still struggling with my own failures, and the consequences of those failures on those I care about, at least I understand what my goals are - what it takes to fulfill the first and second greatest commandments.  I am learning, I am growing, and it is wonderful, I will not be the same person in 5 years as I am today.  And praise God for that, eh?
