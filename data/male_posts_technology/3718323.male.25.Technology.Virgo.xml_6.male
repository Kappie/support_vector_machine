Maybe it will change something inside of me.  Recently I found a site called  urlLink www.chasingeden.com .  I don't know the guy who writes it, but his name is Elliott and he writes about a lot of different stuff, and it all interests me.  He started it as a travel journal I believe, some time during his traveling around 5 continents.  The point is that what he writes is very powerful if you are the right audience, which I guess I am, since it inspired me to  urlLink write this letter , and also to rejuvenate myself with this blog.  One of his major goals is "promoting self-development, the value of good people, and work as a statement of purpose."  All things which make perfect sense to me.  I believe that I am a person who needs this type of inspiration.  More on that later.  He also wants to "create alternatives for the tens of millions of underemployed, disaffected, and chronically frustrated who will not make an effort in life because they do not believe it is worth it."  Again, something that could help me, not that I am any of those things, but nonetheless.  Since this is my first post, a bit of background.  I am 25, live in San Diego with my girlfriend who is also my best friend and who I want to spend my life with, and I have a decent job.  Sounds good, huh?  Well it is.  I have gotten to do enough traveling and seen enough things (not much traveling and not many things, but more than most people I think) to realize that there is more than most people think there is in life.  This is the reason that I live 3000 miles away from where I grew up.  I saw an alternative.  And now I'm here, and 3 1/2 years later, I see more.  After graduating from college with a degree in Computer Science, I was in a good position to more forward, which I did.  At the same time, I started to lose some of the drive to experience new things.  I got comfortable with my life as it was, thinking I was just growing up.  And I was, and still am.  But now my girlfriend and I both see more.  We have decided that in time we will leave San Diego and move abroad.  Probably to Italy.  Time will tell.  About 6 months ago, I read something which made some of the drive I just mentioned start to resurface.  I became interested in travel again.  I started wanting more.  So I created a website called  urlLink Worlds Revealed .  It was an outlet for me to satisfy some of my desire to travel, which I think is more of a desire to learn about new people and new cultures.  We'll see how that works out.  So back to Elliott and Chasing Eden.  Reading this resurfaced this inspiration again.  I believe I am someone who could use a work alternative.  I "work" 40 hours a week, and although definately not overworked, I could use some more time, not to be lazy, but to be me.  I keep myself busy just fine.  The problem is that what I am good at in some ways does match who I am.  I am a software engineer, and although I actually  do  really enjoy computers and software and such, my current job really isn't fulfilling, and I could probably get the work I do over the course of the week done in half the time in exchange for time off.  I also think most people could.  But I like the security.  If I could do what I do, but in a situation where I was fulfilling my own need to be productive, it would be ideal.  I'm not against work, in fact I would probably be bored without it.  I just wish it were more on my own terms.  But I understand most companies have their own agendas and needs, and changing their role would compromise their own success. I think this is what Elliott means.  One of the problems I have is that I like my solitude and I like my security.  I like my alone time.  I am also a quiet person, and by nature not a risk taker.  So all the things I would love to do, like join a volunteer group or meet other people like me or find a better job, I don't do.  Not because I am lazy, but because I do things like what I'm doing right now.  I undertake new projects (like this blog or my website), I read, I learn.  And I also don't want to fall behind.  I've worked hard to get where I am, so a new job would not only have to offer more mentally, but be a better overall opportunity.  I'm very happy now, and although I could use more in the way of work, I don't want less.  Well I've written quite a bit, so I'll stop.  We'll see if these feelings continue.  I hope I don't let the inspiration leave me, which is why I'm starting this blog.  When I write things it kind of sets them in my head more than if they are just left as thoughts.
