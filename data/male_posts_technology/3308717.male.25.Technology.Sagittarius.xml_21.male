It actually seems like this class will be pretty easy. I don't know if it's just because I have had such a long break or if it's because I'm just a little older and a little wiser.  I need to pick a topic for my research paper. I think I'll go with "Censorship In America, More Harm Than Good". I really dislike censorship, I think ratings are a great idea, but not manditory censorship. If you don't like it, DON'T FUCKING LOOK AT IT YOU STUPID MOTHERFUCKER. ...I might include that in my research paper. ^_^  Got quite a bit done on my application last night. Reorganized the classes and did some much needed commenting. =) I still think I need to rewrite the search functionality of it. Maybe I'll have it return each match individually instead of as a single array... then again, it might be more memory/cpu intensive that way... I shall stew on it.   -intX    what?
