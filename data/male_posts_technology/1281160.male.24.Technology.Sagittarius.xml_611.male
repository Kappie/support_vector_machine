I think, its not one of the election stunt which politicians usually do.  Has there been any accomplished tasks by our govt. recently, apart from planning? And did all ur people have ur houses dug up with rain water harvest pits? Yes, its there at my place and also at my inlaws place.   Hope these pits not to disappear in years time with all mud on road. Rajesh has our CM made any provision to insist that these pits should be left open or covered properly and not become waste in course of time? The sad thing is, most of them are trying to just make a pit and put some stone(jalli) and then let the water get into it rather than adopting the exact method of stuffing with charcoal, fine sand, coarse sand and things like that. Hei guys, can u come up with how the pit should be stuffed? If i am clear about how it should be, then i am interested in submitting a proposal of insisting to check the healthy condition of pits once in a year or insist that if not.  And on to Vijay babu's ques, i like answering to it with a quote in general on the current Indian Education system . Here starts the quote............. (I have posted it onto our groups too)    One of the most remarkable features of British rule in India has been the fact that the greatest injuries done to the people of India have taken the form of blessings. Of this, Education is a striking example; for no more crushing blows have ever been struck at the roots of Indian National evolution than those which have been struck, often with other, and the best intentions, in the name of Education....   The most crushing indictment of this Education is the fact that it destroys, in the great majority of those upon whom it is inflicted, all capacity for the appreciation of Indian culture.   Speak to the ordinary graduate of an Indian University, or a student from Ceylon, of the ideals of the Mahabharata he will hasten to display his knowledge of Shakespeare; talk to him of religious philosophy you find that he is an atheist of the crude type common in Europe a generation ago, and that not only has he no religion, but he is as lacking in philosophy as the average Englishman; talk to him of Indian music he will produce a gramophone or a harmonium, and inflict upon you one or both; talk to him of Indian dress and jewellery he will tell you that they are uncivilized and barbaric; talk to him of Indian art it is news to him that such a thing exists; ask him to translate for you a letter written in his own mother-tongue he does not know it. He is indeed a stranger on his own land.  It is hard to realize how completely the continuity of Indian life has been severed. A single generation of English education suffices to break the threads of tradition and to create a nondescript and superficial being deprived of all roots  a sort of intellectual pariah who does not belong to the East or the West, the past or the future. The greatest danger for India is the loss of her spiritual integrity. Of all Indian problems the educational is the most difficult and most tragic.  Ananda Coomaraswamy    There is a need for change in the education ssytem as such and i dont know to comment on what we got in our Master's! I really wonder what we get in Universities and educational institution now a days is the true education! When i myself is not clear about it, i dont want to advice others and confuse them too. so leave them to decide on education for their choice. Adhayum choicela vidaama irundha sari!!!!!!!!!!
