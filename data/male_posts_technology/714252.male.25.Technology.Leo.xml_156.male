Why do people not understand why I don't want to make an ass of myself infront of hundreds of excellent salsa dancers??  Anywho..  All is good but still no sign of laser treatment.. In the mean time I gave up and tried another alternative to shaving my testes.. (No Bubbles, It didn't involve any honey OR small furry animals.. But now that you mention it...) Last week I tried Immac! I have to say Jonnys reaction was the best.. He started to give out to Helena for leaving "Them wimmin products" in our bathroom and his face when I told him the "scrapper thingy" was mine! LOL!!! Anyway.. You are probably wonderin' what the results were like (or screaming NO! NO MORE INFORMATION!) and I have to say I was very pleased.. I think next time (tonight) I will have to try using more cream because I think I didn't use enough but it did a really good job.. Very smooth and none of the stress sharp implements down there usually bring to my healthy lifestyle ;)  K, Gotta go get home and fed...
