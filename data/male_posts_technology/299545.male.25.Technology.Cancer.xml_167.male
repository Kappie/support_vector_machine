The stop-and-search procedure, largely prompted by the March 11 train bombings that killed 191 people in Spain, will involve explosive-sniffing dogs and all 247 uniformed MBTA police officers, and is set to be in place for July's Democratic National Convention, MBTA T Police Chief Joseph Cartercq told the Globe.  "I have no trepidation about being first,'' Carter said. "I don't want to be the first to do an interview about having a serious incident that may have some terrorist indications to it. I want to be in a position to prevent and detect and apprehend someone prior to them causing damage. We want to do this to encourage people to feel safe on the MBTA, to utilize public transportation.  As long as they are not too Draconian in their implmentation of  urlLink this  it seems like a fine idea to me. It always struck me how little public transportation security there is in the US compared to Europe. Nothing like the sight of a member of the Gendarmie holding a machine gun to keep you in line on the Metro in Paris.
