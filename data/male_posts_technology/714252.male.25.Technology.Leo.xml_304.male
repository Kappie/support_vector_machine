It's like someone said, you know what? I bet Michael will type this address into his browser one day and we should really be ready for him!  Anywho, The front of the cafe is now orange.. I have to say it looks even better than I thought it would! Go me!  Also I decided to extend my "hair loss" activities recently and decided to try using imac all the way up to just under my chest. I have to say it was rather rocking and I was well pleased.. Then came the hair growth. My plan was to wait till it's long enough to wax and then get rid of it proper like. OH MY GOD DOES IT ITCH.. I can not wait for tonight\tomorrow.. I never thought I would look forward to the torture that is waxing but anything would be better than this.  Little bit worried about a friend who is sick at the moment. I know she will be fine but you know how it is.. Hoping she gets better soon and everything goes ok today.. Know she doesn't read this but want to put the good vibes out there anyway..  Hmm, what else is going on eh?  Oh yeah, I'm going to try and actually start to work on web stuff again sometime soon (possibly starting today)  Going to TRY and do something about the whole comment thing as fast as I can.. I am so sorry about all the probs just glad it isn't my code that sucks donkey cock..  K, back to work or something.. Talk to you all whenever you finally make it to the cafe because these days I am either here or at home.. I have no life anymore..
