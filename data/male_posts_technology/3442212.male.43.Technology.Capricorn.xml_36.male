This  is  the spare pair.  What's a cynic to do?  I went out to the car and got my swim goggles out of my gym bag.  These goggles were purchased off the shelf for less than ten dollars. They have vision correction built in. They're made by Body Glove. I can drive in them. I look silly, but I'm safe.  I want another pair, but I can't find them on line. Maybe Sports Authority still has some. Must look.
