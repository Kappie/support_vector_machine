That should mean everything is ok but oh no - I have to go and make things rubbish anyway. I'm supposed to be at one of my really good mates house at the minute - but I'm not there. Why not? I'm really not sure - I really haven't felt like I've been fitting in with that group of friends recently. There's not that many of them that I could actually sit and have a meaningful conversation  I guess the ones who I used to be able to do that with, I'm feeling a bit distant from them at the minute.  On a better note, this week should be pretty good - I'm meeting up with the people from CSSM on monday night. I'm not exactly sure what we're going to be doing but whatever we do, I'm really looking forward to seeing everyone again - it should be class.  A couple of really good gigs coming up this week too - Idlewild on friday  The Frames, Idlewild (again!), Bell X1, Supergrass  Halite on Saturday. Think Chris  I are probably going to go out canoeing one evening as well which will be class.  More good news for me in that the premiership season has begun again - I'm a big Man Utd fan  can't wait for their first league game of the season tomorrow against Chelsea. I'm going out with a mate to watch it on Sky.  Really haven't done a whole lot today - Got up about 1pm, had a shower, shaved my head (oh yes, i'm quite bald now), spoke to a few mates on messenger, messed about with this blogger thing (changing how it looks etc.)  now I'm at a total loss for what to do for the rest of the night. I was going to hire a dvd but I'm really, really short on cash at the minute so I can't really afford to.  Anyway, I'll find something to do. I've got to start to do more exercise....but I don't think I'll start tonight.
