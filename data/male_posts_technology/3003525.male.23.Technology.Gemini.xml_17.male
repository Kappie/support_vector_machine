Today, I went to  urlLink Fry's Electronics , quite possibly the most  amazing  electronics store I've ever been in. They have everything. When I say  everything , I mean  everything . Washing machines, TVs, Stereos, Telescopes, Music, Video games, Motherboards, processors, flippin individual integrated circuits. EVERYTHING. It was blowing my mind. It was also, honestly, the largest building I've ever been in. It is huge. We ran into my little brother,  urlLink Timbot , who mans the video game section of the store. He loves it. I love him because he loves it.   ok.  I ate two beef and bean burritos this morning. GAS CITY, MOTHERF*CKERS.   I bought this game,  urlLink Otogi , for my xbox today, and I have to say that it friggin sucks. This game is the epitome frustrating controls, and most of the shit in the game just doesn't make sense. If I'm a spirit that is hung halfway between the world of the living and the dead, and I'm bought back to re-kill demons to send their souls back to the realm of the dead, why do I earn money while doing it, and why can I  buy  stuff. I'm the fucking undead. Who would sell me anything? I mean, they could have honestly come up with a way to get me new items without resorting to earning gold and purchasing them. Anyway. I decided that I'd have a better time teaching physics to the retarded kid down the street.  ok... I'm in love with, and have been in love with my  urlLink Gemstar REB1100  for almost 4 years now. I'm on my second one, as I accidentally dropped my first one too many times. The only annoying thing is that I'd like to get the firmware updates for it, but Gemstar only offers (offered?) them through the use of the modem built into the device. Only problem is that since they pulled support almost a year ago, I think they have just recently turned off the ability to update the firmware. This totally sucks. I really wish that I had gotten on the ball a while ago, and plugged it in, but no, my dumbass had to wait. I'm wondering if I'll be able to get ahold of someone at   urlLink Gemstar Ebook ... I swear that, less than a month ago, their website was working just fine. I bet I missed it by a couple days. hah.  I'm currently trying to sell my  urlLink 2002 Subaru Impreza WRX . Some dude just low-balled me, and I told him no. (sigh). I wish that someone would honestly realize that it's a good deal as it is. It has a frigging Subaru Added Security Gold warranty with a zero dollar deductible until March 2009 which is worth 1500 dollars on it's own.   oh well. I'm gunna get back to watching TV. you kids enjoy your internet experience.
