But the only point is, the current state where the world is moving to, forces us to use a foreign langueage just because it is going to play a big role in earning the livelihood for many people. But having said that, if u r not living in Tamil Nadu... tell me honestly... haven't u felt a new found enthusisam when u get a Tamil counterpart - a colleague or a room-mate or a friend... doesn't ur face give a quick little smile when u see a vehicle with TN registration... and if u r not in India llike sindu and Valli... the word "tamil" always gives pleasure as its so scarce that they come across this...  Even though, driven by circumstances, we are forced to use English in a lot of places that provide us the daily bread.. its always a passion and a mark of pride when it comes to interacting in Tamil... u will understand that better if u r outside Tamil Nadu... and even better if u r outside the country...
