The British firm QinetiQ has invented a "smart" changing room that uses digital camera images to tell shoppers what clothes look good on them.  Hmmm... technology!! It does wonders!!  Around six 3D cameras would be installed in each changing cubicle, to take pictures and record precise measurements from more than 1,000 points on their "subject".  Whoa! ... cameras in the changing room??! ... No thank you!! ;-)
