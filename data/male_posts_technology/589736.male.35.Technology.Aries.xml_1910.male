I mentioned to Angie, I've always felt that if we don't like someone because they're unlikeable, the script is good; if we don't like someone because we're supposed to not like them, the script is bad.  A lot of "this one's supposed to be evil;" "this one's supposed to be good;" "oh, now, this one's supposed to be a rascal, look out."  I might try again some random day when it reruns.  Lower expectations might help on a second attempt.
