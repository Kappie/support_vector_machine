And I caught "I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here". Well, first of all, they sort of stretch the limit of the word celebrity. OK, Chris Judd, who's only claim to fame is that he was married to Jennifer Lopez for 5 minutes? Melissa Rivers, the daughter of a third-rate celebrity? A playboy model who is Iain Ziering's (from 90210) ex-wife? Rod Stewart's ex-wife? Ok. "I'm related or once was married to a half-celebrity" is about to begin. I swear they're probably taping this on some back lot in L.A. The jungle does not seem real.  It's interesting that they're doing it live. That's all I can say about that.
