The other night however I wanted to find out the artist for one of the songs from the soundtrack.  On reviewing the names one of the job names really caught my eye, I even had to rewind to make sure I saw it right… GAFFER!!!  What the hell is that, I can’t even guess the job description for it.  Finding this intriguing I started looking to see if this was some sort of Cult in the Film industry and not one page down there was another one… KEY GRIP and another BEST BOY!!!  You would look a twat going to the pub, chatting up a girl and then all of a sudden she asks the question “So what do you do for a living?” I can see the reply now “Ahh… I’m a Second Assistant Key Grip!!!”   So with my brains baffled I went to the portal of all knowledge, no not PK, the internet and the second search it found was  “What is a Gaffer?”   Only in the world of thespians could they find such stupid names for ordinary jobs.  Well that’s my rant for the day.  Danger
