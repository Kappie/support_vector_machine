I've been reading lots of it (as one would suspect) and I haven't had much occasion to before.  go to  urlLink lisp.org  for some introductory information.  the obligatory  urlLink slashdot discussion  about lisp.  an interesting insight and term in the last,   "The reason why it's not hyped is because Lisp HAD a hype in its history whose decline happened to the same time (and was mostly induced by) the AI winter."   very true, lisp is a great language, but it gets the reputation of 'deadness' because of it's association with AI. which is 'in the past'.   The 'AI winter', a nifty way to describe the terrible drought, doubt, and despair over the heads of the AI community....
