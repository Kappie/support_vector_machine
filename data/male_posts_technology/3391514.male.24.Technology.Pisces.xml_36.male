I watched  Shrek  again... it was just as funny the second time around, if not more so.  And then I went to see  Shrek 2 .  It was fantastic, and slightly edged out the original.  Obviously, it wasn't as novel, but the story was good, the graphics slightly improved, and there were many more references and in-jokes.  Additionally, following yesterdays RPG discovery, I came up with a game I probably could have written in 24 hours, if I had 24 hours to myself.  The game is provisionally titled " Heroland ", and allows players to create and play super heroes (or villains) of any type.  The main draw to the system is simplicity - a character can be created in a short space of time, and powers are easy to figure so long as the player has an idea what they want to do.  I bet I'll get bored quickly.
