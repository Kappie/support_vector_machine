While indeed I did whine about the four hours it took to make a two hour trip, we did make it.  I mean can you ladies learn how to give directions?  or better yet, why don't you just give us the full address of our next destination, so we can leave up the directions to mapquest :-)  Holla at double La being twanky!  We had a blast at her cribb, despite the fact that your brother and his friends are a bunch of wheezes  Craig worked real hard on his tan, with little to no success :-)  Shouts out go to the bonaroo (sp?) crew who return sometime tomorrow?  Cookout at c-money's cribb tonight, holla.  beat it, craig
