Let's see, Saddam is no longer persecuting his own people or the people around Iraq, nor is he harboring or funding terrorists any longer, Iran has opened up about its nuclear program, Syria has taken its rhetoric down a notch or two, Ghaddifi has renounced WMD and is apparently trying to re-join the civilized world, Pakistan is actually jailing a few Islamic extremists and trying to look as though it is assisting US forces hunting for Al Queda along the Afghan/Pakistan border.  Hmmm....less safe?  For whom, exactly?
