I love it when you never have a lack of things to talk about and before you know it the time has flown by.  Well, I guess  I    never  lack topics of conversation, since I tend to dominate them. Must watch that, tut tut. Anyway, the traditional 1 hour first meeting ended up being more like 2 hours.  That's a good thing, right?  Tonight I'm going for beer-thirty with my buddy Thad, then my church group's Thurs. nite swim  bible-study.  I think Mikey let slip yesterday that they may have a little surprise bday thing planned for me.  That's cool. If not, that's cool too. After 30, I didn't care so much about bdays anymore. I mean look, I don't even care enough to spell it out!  But maybe I should care. I should care that I'm one year closer to my moldy grave. Well, cremation for me actually, I'm already a card-carrying member of Neptune Society.  (psst, that means I'm being cremated and it's all paid for and everything)
