It was at the table...when my mom talks about our past failures...and how each and everyone have learned our mistakes...and when the finger starts pointing...around...and later it was pointed at me...blames, hurts , condemnation, persecution on my own life. I am the eldest in the family and therefore how i live my life have been the main example where my bros and sis would follow. I was on the way back ...from KL to Ipoh and I borrowed RM10 from my bro to pay the toll..cause i spend quite a lot of money on petrol and car maintainence. My bro took it differently as me charging him for the trip. Another fren was there but i choose not to charge him...cause well a cell member and a good fren, i am willing to pay for him.  My mom pressured me the whole day about it and condemn me .for charging the bro and not the fren..you should not charge your brother about anything. I said that i would give back soon. Then at the dinner table...I was again pressured and persecuted...but this time by my bros and sis about the company i am hanging out , majority the cell members,, churchmates and frens. I have over the last few postings...saying that God have really provided me frens of integrity and of good attitudes. Then they start banging on you all about their integrity and that 's where argument ensued... In the end all of the blame falls back on me...even my bros and sis bad attitudes,,the failures..., I am as a big bro have to take full responsibility and I have to take full blame.  I just stood there...receiving with the full grace...knowing all this God's plan is to built me up. I told my mom..let's bygone be bygone....That time..i settled every debts emotional and monetary with my bros and sis ...and yet my mom is nagging about and dwelling about it ...the whole time.  I calmly , told my mom, that yes i have went thru some of the biggest mistakes, failures and hardships, but I believe God have provided each and everyone of us a second chance...a hope....Then Christianity topics was condemned and stepped upon. This whole incident, I don't blame them..I knows a lot of it are my own mistakes..and I humbly accepted it all ...cause i deserved it.But when Jesus was stepped upon and how every Christian is condemned because of several bad eggs...that i cannot stand...I rebuke them straight that they can talk and blame me..persecuted.but they cannot blame or talk bad about Jesus .  I told my family that because of several bad eggs, you can't blame God...on all this...Instead don't dwell on the mistakes of others...don't dwell on our own either...but learn from...and move on. I quoted Forgetting What Lies Behind but Strive for what is in front. I rebuke them straight on with full fury ,,that my live i can be persecuted..or condemned or blamed..but not God..  The minute i finished, i broke down in tears in front of them and explaining that everyone God have us a second chance...not just me ...but everyone in the family. Instead of blaming one another, we should forgive our past sins...and move on...God's presence is so strong that time..i broke in tears...and yet i am comforted and assured..that healing is taking place in my family.  I confessed my past mistakes and have taken full responsibilities and have said sorry to each family member...and yet warning them not to curse on God...because God is the one who have taken my past failures,mistakes and hurts in life to change me to who i am today...not perfect...but close..  At that time, everyone grew silent and nothing was said...and everyone started to calm down....  I believe God 's presence and His healing hand is upon my family and even as i am amazed at How God enabled me to speak His Words  thru my life and thru who i am today...In the family I am  viewed as a fanatic..but I seen myself as just a vessel for God to work ..nothing more..  I will continue to be persistent to share God's principles that i have instilled in my own life and share with it.  So Praise God for all that's happen and truly the Work have been prepared ...God is just watching the results come to pass...  So if ur family have the same situation in this CNY, Start the year rite...ask your family for forgiveness and share God's principles...and His Spirit with everyone in ur family...and believe it God is already here and Miracles, healings and Whole lot more will take place. if only you take your first step.  Connect, Relate and Resonate the Faith Of Jesus Christ. Joshua Tan
