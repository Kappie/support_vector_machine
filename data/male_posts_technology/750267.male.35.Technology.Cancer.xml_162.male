They've digitally scanned hundreds of thousands of books, and now their search engine returns results from INSIDE these books.  Let's say you're looking for a book on  Queen's Quay  in downtown Toronto.  You could search for "queen's quay toronto" in Amazon.com, and you would probably get no hits. Amazon would only look in the book's title for those words, and your results would be poor.  Now you search for that phrase, and you get 37 hits. Why? Because you get ANY book with the words "queen's quay" and "toronto" in them. Wow! I now find books like these that I would not have found before. --  urlLink The Living City : How America's Cities Are Being Revitalized by Thinking Small in a Big Way   Waterfront revitalization is a big topic when talking about Queen's Quay, so this search is revealing books you might not have found otherwise.
