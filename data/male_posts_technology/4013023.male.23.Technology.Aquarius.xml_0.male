Someone who speaks for us as humans sharing a planet with many breeds of the same. When a true leader walks our land we will know, we will listen, and we will follow effortlessly. There won't be any campaigns and there will be no marketing. This leaders presence, words, values, integrity and heart will be desired by all of the world. the power of faith this man will obtain, not only from people in america, but everyone around the world, will be the reason our governments will feel threatened and take actions to remove this person from our quest for humanity. This leader will speak from his heart and be adored by all walks of life. This leader will become so powerful that our constitutions will be over ridden and rewritten to reflect a society once dreamed of and now forgotten in our corrupt universe. People like JFK and Martin Luther King were these types of leaders. If they were left in peace to continue their journey through life we may have seen such a thing, but they were removed from existance because they were too powerful and considered a threat to the people behind the government. These people do not want this leader to exist. They want us to choose our president from their shady "he's better than the other two guys" roster. Out of all the people in the world we are left with two or three human beings to settle with as our savior? Of course. this is the way it works for them. so weigh out the pros and cons and make your decision. This is pathetic.I love america.I love the whole fucking world.I love the idea of world peace. This leader will walk amongst us very soon. It will be undeniable. People will follow. People will talk.A following will rapidly build into a voice like we have never heard before. This leader will not have chosen to be the one and will not be trying to convince anyone of his heart and intentions. We will know when that time has come. The more our technology can cause awareness, the more it will be too complicated for our government to erase this leader. Everything happens for a reason. we have become victims of a corrupt government that is thriving on the ignorance they insist we are made of. We have to get perspective and look at the big picture. We are the playing pieces for a game of control and power played by the people who see humanity as something disposable. As for the presidents, i will always have hope in the chance of that leader actualy being one of the candidates. If it is so then let it be and i will know in my heart that it is the one. This leader will not need to be re-elected because he will rewrite the book on how we govern our societies and remian our leader until he is no longer a leader. Maybe i think too much. maybe i don't think enough.I have never been so concerned about our well being as a world as i have become today.I am a dreamer and have hope. That's a good start for me.I think i am making no sense sometimes when my mind is in utopia. It's time to be aware. Think about your decisions. Go with your heart. Things can only get better, right? Let's go vote.
