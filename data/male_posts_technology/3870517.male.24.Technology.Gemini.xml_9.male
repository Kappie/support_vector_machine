Our office is new, we just transferred here 2 days agao and is still under going some minor changes. I could hear the knocks of hammers and it is quite irritating. i felt like my ears are going away from my head. And now somebody is sawing. Ooops, its 3 in the afternoon already, and i am hungry. Maybe tonight we might get to watch Kill Bill 2. I wanna know why some of the critics dont like it. I love Uma Thurman, i love watching her kicking some hard ass. i have watched the first one and it was great, although too bloody but still great. I thin k it is time for me to smoke... my head is busting me... Oh, i have to wash my laundry tonight coz ill be havinga seminar on saturday and i'll be staying at the venue. This seminar has been postponed twice and fortunately just got its approval... nasty huh?  I just checked my blog on my pinoyster account and omg, it wasnt there... watever they did to my blog... :(  ok, so this morning i came late again, although we dont are not entitled to have a late coz our office hours are flexible. (the priviledge that i think i have been abusing) hehehehehehe... lucky for me, because they are fixing everything here in our office and it is kind of noisy in here... and my officemate been going outside coz he can't take the noise... first thing i did today is to check on my pending program... i need to make the necessary updates our branches... quite easy coz i just finished it, have it emailed too so i need not to worry about it...  sorry i cannot collect my thoughts that much... ill just post watever is it i want to post...  thanks for reading... :D
