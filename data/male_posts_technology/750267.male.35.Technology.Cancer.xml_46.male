That woman annoys me to no end, and with the recent announcement that her CNN show was cancelled, I thought this would be a good chance to mock her a little bit. Mock mock.  I caught her show in the first week it was on. In it, she was lambasting a guy who had sued the government over the Pledge of Allegience. Essentially, this guy was arguing that he did not believe in God, he is raising his daughter not to believe in God, and his daughter's school is forcing her to pledge allegience to "one nation under God". Chung ripped the guy apart. "Are you proud to be an American?" she asked. "Are you prepared for that tag ... 'The Most Hated Man in America'?". This poor fellow, who's only crime was that he thought the constitution protected his religious beliefs or lack thereof, was verbally abused on national TV. Once, Connie asked him if he thought it was selfish of him to persue this lawsuit (which he won by the way) considering the harm that could come to his daughter. The implications of that question are mind-boggling. I would suggest that if anyone harmed this guy's kid, it was their fault and not the father's. But obviously Connie thinks the father is "selfish" for asking the courts for freedom of religion.  Other interviews I saw were as bad or worse.  Once, Connie was interviewing the friends of Laci Peterson, the pregnant woman who was (and still is) missing in California. Connie asks the friends if the Peterson's knew the sex of the unborn baby. The friends said yes, it was a boy. Connie responded by saying something like "Aw, that's so sweet. You must be so excited!" My draw dropped when I heard her say that.  Someone should remind Connie that Laci Peterson and her unborn baby are probably dead. So I would guess the friends are more "sad" and "distraught" than "excited"... Those types of interview gaffs happened often on this show.  I also saw her interview a 15-year old student, who attended the same high school where a student was killed by the "D.C. sniper". Connie: "Are you scared to go to school tomorrow." Student: "No, not really." Connie: "Really? I can't believe that. You have to be a little scared right?" Student: "No, I'm not scared." Connie: "I really think you should be scared. I would be scared if I were you. Why aren't you scared?"  Oh please. The teenager said she wasn't scared. Did Connie think this kid was lying? That she really was scared but didn't want to admit it? Connie Chung made the teenager feel like an idiot for not being scared, and that made me uncomfortable. I was so outraged, I wrote Connie an email telling her she should be ashamed. I can understand (a bit) treating an accused murderer with such disdain (even though I do not like it as an interview technique, I understand it in that instance). But to treat a victim that way -- a 15-year old teen who just saw a fellow student murdered -- that's dispicable. She should have apologized to this kid afterward.  And so, Connie is gone. Bye. See ya later. Well, hopefully not too soon. She was an awful live interviewer, treating many of her guests with disrespect and disgust. Often she was caught not listening to what they were saying. Often she was getting the basic facts of the story wrong. Stuttering - um's, ah's - awkward silences while she thought up the next question. Or asking questions that leave no room for a proper answer. Or asking questions where there is only one answer. Cutting interviewees off mid-sentence -- "Are you finished yet?" Asking the same question twice: "Yeah, I just answered that. Weren't you listening to what I said?"  Anyways, give me more interviewers like Aaron Brown or Anderson Cooper. Smart, well informed, polite to their guests, and above all fair. Opinionated without being obnoxious. More of that. Less of Connie.
