At least someone is happy. I have to go to a wedding saturday, I am not looking forward to it. I hate to dress up. why can't people get married in casual clothes, or hell non at all if they are good looking. Make my life a lot easier.  I just got a jeep wrangler sport almost 2 weeks ago and it is still muddy. I took it through some big rain puddles and small mud holes. I haven't had a chance to wash it. I got half done friday. My father in law was borrowing my wifes grand cherokee to take our camper, camping for the week. I was running the hose and the wife was washing. Well she stopped halfway and rinsed it off so she could come over and help with the explination on where stuff was in the trailer. Hopefully i will be able to wash it today or tomorrow. I probably won't do it tonight as I have another softball game and tomorrow I will probably take the harley to work.  Oh well.
