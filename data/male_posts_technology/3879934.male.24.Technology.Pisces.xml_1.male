Knoppix 3.3 -   Was checking out the knoppix OS, actually its another version of Linux (if i`m not mistaken), the best advantage of this OS is you don`t have to install anything onto your system, it`s a matter of booting (running) the OS CD and 'voila'  I have Linux in my machine...I was fiddling around with it, seems like a sweet tool to learn some fundamentals 'like how to use the vim Editor'...
