Different lots are assigned different colors, and you can buy a hang-tag or sticker whose color coincides with your lot of choice. Only, it's really not that simple. If you are a student, there are certain lots you are allowed to purchase tags for, and if you are faculty or staff you can pick from a different selection. Some of the selections are available to both students and fac/staff, and others are exclusive to each group.  My university is currently in the process of constructing a new parking deck (read: multi-level, covered garage.) This thing is going to be huge and will alleviate much of the parking headache on campus. Or it would if the tags didn't cost $500 per year. These uber-expensive spots are in the "Reserved" group, and are available to anyone with $500. The hang-tag  I  usually buy is a "Fac/Staff" tag, and it costs about $70/year. Very reasonable for someone who makes about $8/hour. Here's the problem: they're re-arranging the lots so that the "Reserved" spots now occupy what used to be "Fac/Staff" spots. Now, the closest I can park on campus to my actual building is about 3 blocks away, and up-and-down 2 hills (which is what we call mountains here in the Ozarks.) So, now I have two choices: 1. I can pay $500 and get a decent spot (which isn't guaranteed; first come, first served,) or 2. I can park 3 blocks and 2 hills away and arrive to work sweaty and out of breath. Since I only make about $8/hour, choice 2 is the only real choice (if you can call that a choice.) Luckily, my boss is on the staff senate and the parking commitee, so maybe we can get something done here.
