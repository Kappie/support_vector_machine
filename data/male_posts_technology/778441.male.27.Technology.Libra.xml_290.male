It has gone on criticizing almost everybody connected with Linux and in the latest court document it has presented,  urlLink SCO criticizes Linus Torvalds   SCO's amended suit against I.B.M., filed late Monday, contends that Mr. Torvalds, who has overseen the development of Linux, appears to have a casual attitude toward intellectual property rights. Linux is distributed free and improved upon by a far-flung network of developers. SCO harps on the fact that Linus has, in the past, spoken freely against the concept of software patents. As a result, SCO contends that Linus is unwilling/inable to identify the IPR origins of the contributed source code that has gone in towards the development of Linux.  But Linus, candid as ever, has been known to pooh-pooh the concept of IPRs and patents on software. "I do not look up any patents on principle because (a) it's a horrible waste of time and (b) I don't want to know."  "The fact is technical people are better off not looking at patents. If you don't know what they cover and where they are, you won't be knowingly infringing on them," In any case, I'm sure that the open source community that has been involved in development of Linux will be up in arms against SCO ( it already is! ). And that's because, SCO has dared to speak against their "God"!!
