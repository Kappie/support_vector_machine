It seems as time goes on I've become closer to my wife's family than my own family.  They really are fun.   I decided a while back that I need to assign all of my responsibilities to my direct reports.  I took a vacation 2 years ago, that turned into a big nightmare.  I was on the phone the whole time, and I really was just miserable.  That's when I decided that I needed to make myself not needed.  I restructured my business unit and assigned all of my responsibilities to my employees.  It's worked out great.  If you can't be replaced, you can't be promoted.        I'm finding it really hard to get back to work.  I've been keeping busy, but I keep looking at the clock waiting for 5:00 PM to roll by so I can leave.  I usually like to work, so I feel bad about that.  It must be spring fever.    It's raining and storming here in Lexington.  There is a tornado warning for the county.
