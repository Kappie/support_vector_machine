 Ahh, good stuff.   urlLink Yahoo  and  urlLink Google  squaring off for the battle of the century.  It's interesting to see Yahoo make these moves in an attempt to quell the coming storm that is Google.  First, a new search engine, now better e-mail services.  Yahoo has to realize that Google's play in the e-mail market is about much more than just giving people more space.  It's about redefining how people think about e-mail.  They're treating e-mail as information, and Google is the ultimate in organizing information so that you can find what you're looking for.  Yahoo on the other hand is about bringing people together into one place.  Will an extra 96 MB of e-mail storage be enough to keep them around?  Who knows.  What I wonder is how this will affect  urlLink Hotmail .  You know that Mr. Gates won't sit idly by and watch these two grab up an even larger share of the market.  This will be a fun one to watch unfold.
