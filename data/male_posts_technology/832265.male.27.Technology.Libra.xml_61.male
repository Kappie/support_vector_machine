"Wow it's superfast." 
"Yeah, but it's got no tabs." 
And then to a lesser extent, "Hey!  This web browser  urlLink wrecked  my operating system."  
I spent some time this weekend exploring the minority opinion.  
Basically, I got de-metaphor'd.  No copy and paste.  No drag and drop.  And all because a Safari preference file wasn't being parsed properly.  How rude.
