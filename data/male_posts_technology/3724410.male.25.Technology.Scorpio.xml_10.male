Translation :      The following is an English translation provided by Sri Aurobindo :-   I bow to thee,    Mother,richly-watered, richly-fruited ,cool with the winds of the south,   dark with the crops of the harvests, The Mother!    Her nights rejoicing in the glory of the moonlight   Her lands clothed beautifully with her trees in flowering bloom   sweet of laughter, sweet of speech    The Mother, giver of boons, giver of bliss!         History :     Vande Mataram is the  national song  of  India . The song was composed by  Bankim Chandra Chatterjee  in a highly  Sanskritized  form of the  Bengali language . The song first appeared in his book  Anandamatha , published in  1882  amid fears of a ban by  British Raj , though the song itself was actually written six years prior in  1876 . "Vande Mataram" was the national cry for freedom from British oppression during the freedom movement. Large rallies, fermenting initially in  West Bengal , in the major metropolis of  Calcutta  (Kolkata), would work themselves up into a patriotic fever by shouting the slogan "Vande Mataram," or "Hail to the Mother(land)!" The British, fearful of the potential danger of an incited Indian populace, at one point banned the utterance of the motto in public forums and jailed many freedom fighters for disobeying the proscription. To this day, "Vande Mataram" is seen as a national  mantra  describing the love of patriots for the country of India. Though a major aspirant for being the  national anthem  of India, Vande Mataram was eventually overtaken by  Jana Gana Mana , which was ultimately chosen. The choice was slightly controversial, since the Vande Mataram was the one song that truly depicted the pre-independence national fervour. The song was rejected on the grounds that  Muslims  felt offended by its depiction of the nation as "Ma  Durga " â€” a  Hindu  goddess, thus equating the nation with the Hindu conception of  shakti , divine feminine dynamic force.     HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY
