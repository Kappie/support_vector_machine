I want to one day be important enough to the world of literature, film, journalism, philosophy--anything, I'm not picky--to have my name   adjectivized.   I want someone to read someone else's work and proclaim it "  Baumgartenian  ."  Now that I think of it, one of my roommates in college put this seed in my head to begin with. His last name is better suited adjectification.  Ideally, I'd like this to be a positive adjective, something that commands instant respect. Looking at my body of work thus far, though, I'd be happy with it becoming a synonym for   urlLink overwrought   or  urlLink  tedious  .     "Ugh, X's new Y was so contrived it was almost Baumgartenian--though not as long and directionless. I wouldn't have been able to stay awake if the indulgent characterization hadn't made the bile surge at the back of my throat."   -- Some Reviewer.   Yes, that would do nicely
