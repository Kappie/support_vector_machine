Was supposed to meet Robin (sec sch friend) for lunch then maybe go around Orchard for a bit before we went down to Siglap. He said he wanted to take a look at Aikido. Was all ready to leave when my dad popped over with a problem. Something was wrong with his PC. I got no idea what he did or what happened (but I dare say it's almost always the user's fault 95% of the time), but the PC somehow kept showing fuzziness and discoloring on the monitor. It just refused to go away. Was actually thinking of leaving since I already made an appointment, but then realised that I won't be back until after Aikido (which means I can only work on it about 11+ after a shower). Haiz, decided to try to fix it then. To my horror, the damn thing just got worse when I restarted it. It just kept on rebooting and never got into windows. Couldn't even enter safe mode. Was seriously pissed coz while working on it my dad was in the background mubming and grumbling away, about why I never set his emails on my side so when his PC is down he can fallback and use my PC instead. Goodness lor! Gimme a break lah. His emails are downloaded from server into his hdd lor, even with an internet connection on my side he also can't view his old mails what. Fish lah! Tried very hard to solve the stupid problem. Manage to find out that the hdd is not faulty (whew...) so I transfered his emails to my PC so he can at least access his mails while I'm away. Throught the 4-5 hrs I was working on this, I let Robin know about what I'm doin so he can at least carry on with whatever he wants to first. He said since he was already in Orchard, he'll hang around in the library and hopefully we can have dinner later. This was a bit preassurising lah, coz I wasn't sure how long I'm gonna take and I just had to rush to do what I can with the PC. Anyway I short circuited my external HDD casing in the process. Was seriously pissed with myself too. Used to bea ble to use this rack and shift it between different systems via a USB connection. Now I need to open up the whole PC and plug it in instead. ARGH!!!!  Anyway, I was almost done when  urlLink you  smsed me about Sensei going down to BVCC instead. By this time it was raining quite badly for awhile already. Anyway, my dad did me a favour by dropping me part of the way where I avoided the rain and to grab a bus down. Originally arranged to meet Robin at Heeren, but didn't know exactly where we were meeting. I waited at the bus stop for awhile before walking over to Taka. Called him continously and smsed him for 30-40 mins and didn't get a reply (Robin, if you're reading this I have to tell you man, this is something typical of you. Better change ar!) I called until his hp actually went flat. At this stage I was seriously exasperated because I had to way fo reaching him and I kinda lost the mood to even go for Aikido. Gave him a final sms saying that I'm going home. On the way to the busstop, I got a call from him. We arranged again to meet at Orchard MRT control station immediately. Apparently, this bugger kept his handphone on silent mode!! ^%$#%!!! Was seriously pekchek man but I figured things weren't totally his fault coz I kinda made him wait all afternoon alone anyway. Haiz ... For both our benefit, I decided to goto BVCC instead of Siglap for the evening to train. Wasn't in quite the mood to travel long distance to Tanah Merah at that point.  We grabbed a bus to Holland V and had dinner at BK. After that we went over to BVCC. Aikido was great lor! It was the first time I was in Sunny's class. Very good. He was very vocal and kept coming up with a lot of points for us to note. Like  urlLink you  said his movements were really something. So relaxed, smooth and natural. I felt like a cuckoo when I was practicing lor. He kept emphasising being serious to my group (Edwin and another guy) coz I think they were joking a little bit too much/loud enough to get noticed. Heh ... well it was still enjoyable. I just didn't manage to accomplish tho. Ended the evening with kokyuho with  urlLink Ms Ng  there, ar I still dun get it lor. Sometimes can, most often can't. Seems like every 6th kyu-er and above I came across are able to do it leh. Haiz ...  Anyway like  urlLink you  noted, Robin was sitting outside even tho he was actually here to 'take a look'. I know him long enough to just leave him to do what he wants even if I think some of his actions might be a bit weird. He has his reasons for his actions I suppose, I'm just not able to agree with his rationale sometimes. Anyway, I used to be very judgemental of him in sec sch. In fact a group of us kinda gave him a hard time then coz he was quite 'different'. I've kinda grown out of it liao, think it just comes down to respecting what he wants to do. Anyway, most of his actions dun quite affect me so that's fine by me.  Well that's yesterday, but today I spent the whole day testing the PC and fixing it. Managed to find out that the graphics card was faulty. Seems that the motherboard was a bit dodgy also. Anyway got the thing to work and had to reinstall windows twice, plus all relevant software. Than spent hours customising small itsy bitsy things to prevent the 'ignoramus'es in my home from meddling too much with the system and making more problems for me later. All the while my dad was again popping in and out asking me if it's ok already, what's the problem with it, why it like dat, etc etc. ARGHHH!!.... Actually had the intention to go Sim Lim get some parts, exchange some faulty CD-Rs, get some clothes from Seiyu and asking Robin to join me. But things just dragged on so long (was in front of the PC since 8am till 9pm straight) that I kinda dropped the idea. I felt too tired anyway and I have to go back camp first thing tomorrow morning for overnight duty. Well at least, I'll have 1 whole day to sleep and rest there without being bugged by PC problems. Think I'll go Sim Lim/Bugis on Mon instead. Probably ask Robin if he's interested then.  Sigh, the past 48hrs would've been sheer torture and demoralising if not for those few hrs of Aikido at BVCC...
