If at all anyone uses it, they'll land up making nose prints on the LCD display. Why dont camera makers stop copying mistakes ? I do understand a viewfinder is useful in a digital camera when the battery is down and there's some juice left just enough to save pictures and not enough to display them on the LCD. But why dont they come up with a flip up view finder so that, I dont land up making nose/cheek impression on the LCD display.
