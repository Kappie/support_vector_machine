I may actually get help for my ADD... wow I dont know how to react to that thought! I am gonna probally be different. However, I am ready for that change. Oh yea.. tommrow I have a Dr. Apt to talk about my lab results that I took about a month ago. I guess if there was anything major wrong I would of been called. Right? I know that I may have  urlLink H. Pylori  again, I ain't looking forward i to taking  urlLink Bioxin  again. Man the after taste in my mouth sucks! The only thing that I found to help it is  urlLink Sweet Tarts .      Hey what do ya'll think of me making thing links?      I need to add a links section. does anyone know of a good site where I can get a app that would do it. e-mail me at  urlLink xhero0@hotmail.com       Lates!
