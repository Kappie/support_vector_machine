I'm glad not all media outlets are buying into the "police brutality" angle, nor the "police racism" angle.  Apparently, the statistics for PCP use are on the rise. This means the number of people who will resist arrest, and thus require police force to subdue, will increase as well. I, for one, am glad that officers put themselves in harm's way to try to help these people and protect us all. Thank you.
