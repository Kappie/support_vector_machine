Shihonage went on to some others which I can't recall the name or be sure of. Was quite tiring but fun. Dis some kotegaeshi as well.   Aching like siao this morning, still had to make myself go for my run. It's prob the last few things I can do to prep myself for the marathon this sun. Goodness, I dunno how I'm going to finish the distance. Been out of training for too long already. I've only just gotten back to getting used to a slow but more regular pace of running. But I'm not confident of getting a better timing this time round. Which reminds me, I think I better visit the website again to familarise myself with the route and procedures for the run. Still need to plan breakfast and time to meet friends on that day itself. Sigh, more liasing.  And I really have to say this, I'm STILL waiting for some kind of notice from the police force.
