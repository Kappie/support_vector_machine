I think the last thing I informed everyone about was the breaking up of my relationship with my girlie for the FINAL time! Well I am happy to announce that I am still single and loving it hehe, of course that is unless any nice ladies come along. I have finally managed not to get pulled in by the same old female tactic of ' But I miss you! '. No I'm now content with being alone for a while, until I meet a woman thats cool.  Anyway, 'What the hell have you been doing with yourself lately' I hear you cry! Well let me fill you in.......(especially if your an attractive bird if you know what I mean hehe).........  It all started last Friday, when Custard and myself boarded a water transport known only as the Condor Express, our destination......England, our goal.......to go SKYDIVING YYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Yes thats right fans, I have been skydiving for four days!!! Now let me give my opinion on a common topic of skydiving 'It is better then sex' Or at least any sex that I'v had so far. The adrenalllin is STILL flowing through my veins and I havn't been able to sleep since!  I am now a CAT 2 Skydiver, and it's bloody great, this is because it has been one of my lifes ambitions to jump out of planes and it is something that I intend to do on a regular basis from now on. I can't begin to explain the rush you get when you are at four thousand feet and the door opens, only to look out and see nothing but open sky and the airfield below you, looking like a model you built as a child.  The instructer tells you to position yourself in the door, you do. Then he say 'GO!!' And you do!!!!!! The initial feeling as you freefall is beyond anything I have ever experienced in my life and it seems to last an age when it happens. Then you count....1000....2000...3000...4000...Check canopy (thats to make sure your rig has opened properly and deployed your parashute), now at this point, if your canopy is fine then all you have to do is enjoy the ride down, and thats just as fun! So there you are sailing down to earth as the dots become larger due to falling at around fourty miles and hour or so. You pull on the brakes and you slow down almost to stop in mid air, then you release the breaks and feel the rust again as the canopy rushes downwards! Next you lock the steering cords far to the left or right and start a spiral even faster downwards! Then you just keep on playing hehe. Finally you have to land and that is just as much a thrill as the rest or it!  Well I meet some real cool people over there and a few lovely ladies (jumps for joy) and I am going to go back as soon as I can afford it. Sorry that my account of my trip was brief but I now have to go to the harbour and catch a boat to 'Donkey Land'..oooppppsss....I mean 'Guernsey', sorry!!! Lifes hard lol, Baity signing off........................
