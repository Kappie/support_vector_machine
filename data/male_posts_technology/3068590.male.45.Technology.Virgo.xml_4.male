Now would be a good time for Paul Martin the fearless prime minister of Canada stand up and do what he said he would. A very novel and unique idea for a Canadian prime minister.  He said that he wanted to repair the damage made by his predecessor and patch relations with the United States, and specifically George Bush.   Well bigger opportunities don't come along that often Mr. Martin. Call up George and state that you would be very pleased to send the other 5 troops of Canadian military to Iraq to fight in the War on Terrorism.   Just a thought, however, I think that Mr. Martin will no doubt be creating his next crisis to divert Canadians waning attention span.   (No slight against the 10 outstanding Military personnel in Canada. They have done extremely well on a poor budget.)
