He knows everything I know... and he knows everything still I need to know... He's up.. he's my god... I need his blessings...  I do my duty...  for that is my only happiness...  I removed the  not s,  down s...from the original content. i personally feel that, if i really believe in god, then first i shld believe in myself and shld not use those words...   ----------  sriprasath -  machan unakku ennada achu... yeen da ippadi yellam post panra... ennamo podaaa...   ---------  Belated birthday wishes to our blog...
