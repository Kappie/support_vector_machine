It was of course Father's Day, and for a guy who has no kids, I ended up with 20 bones  a gift bag :-) Altho the money was for services rendered on some computer projects, I was still happy to be a dude on this day.  I also played a selection on piano on program during night service. I wasn't far from the end, which isn't an unfamiliar position cuase in times past, I was often the last performer...but my skills are not even what they were then ( thats bad). But for a song i've neva played b4, it worked out great. I need to watch my speeches tho. Crowds tend to make me nervous, tho ironically I could care less what they think or say bout my whole thing lol. But when i'm in the midst of my craft, I strive to be a perfectionist. Try to be as non-derelect as possible   der·e·lict:   Neglectful of duty or obligation; remiss.   Well look at the time. We'll get up peoples, time to roll.
