And so my opinion about television shows might be crap. But I'll give it to you anyway.    Ed  is the only show I can think of where the title character is the only character on the show worth hating. First of all, let me just say that I generally enjoy  Ed , but I think I enjoy it partially for the same reason I enjoyed Northern Exposure: it has good characters with real problems, and it's pretty funny at times. At the same time, I liked Joel Fleischman from  Northern Exposure , and I don't like Ed. I don't like him because he doesn't care about people. His goals are all related to chasing some crazy idea that will garner him attention and satisfy his freakish desire to see other people do stuff they don't want to do.  Ed's pitiful life involves a ton of people, but paying close attention to his interaction with people reveals an interesting thing: he doesn't really  care  about anyone. He only cares about a person who is pushing away from him, because that represents one less person he can convince to follow an idea of his. Why do you think he gets so jealous when Carol does anything that isn't Ed-centric? His purchase of Stuckeybowl was oriented to the same goal--be the center of attention, and watch as other people come together to pay homage to that idea.  I don't like Ed because his amiable exterior is nothing but a front for a diabolical desire to have others worship him as the embodiment of any number of hair-brained ideas. Each other person on the show has some attachment to others that is related to actual human affection, but not Ed. I like each person on the show, but not Ed. He's the least satsifying human on the show.  In thinking about it, that probably makes the show interesting, but as the main character, it's too bad the writers will probably make him successful, and the other characters will swirl around him in a worshipful dance. He ought to end up with no friends, or in therapy, trying to get help in order to see people as real, feeling people, and not just props to arrange on the set of an idea he has. Ed's continued success is the primary illogical aspect of the show, because nobody could stand living around someone like that for more than a little while--no matter how many times he tries to rescue them from leaving by dressing up in a knight suit.  P.S.  Do you remember when Carol decided she liked Ed, and she dressed up in the knight suit to impress Ed? Do you remember his reaction to her? He hated it, and not because he was confused about whether he wanted her (remember: he wants everyone, so that all can be his minions.), but because--did you guess it?--it wasn't  his  idea. That is, she wasn't doing something silly because he put her up to it, but because she thought of it herself, and that bothered Ed. You almost hear his thoughts at that moment: "What is she doing? That is totally my idea. I can't believe she thinks she can come up with her own ideas. This is so lame. But maybe if I could get her to dress up in a Robin Hood costume..."
