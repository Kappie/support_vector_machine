In fact, calling this thing a "trinket" is an an understatement.  At 3,104 pieces, this is the biggest Lego set I have ever purchased in my entire life. The finished product spans 3 feet in length and weighs a good 21 lbs. Maybe you're asking yourself, what does this have to do with waffles? Absolutely nothing!   There is a lot of repetition taking place in the construction of the Star Destroyer. One such repetitious act required me to create (16 times per frame) the details concerning the vents, shielding and turbolaser emplacements of each side of the star destroyer. It was a daunting task (one that I managed to finish last night) but the finished details on the side look really well...  I just noticed that whenever I delete a letter, the sentence implodes on itself. I hate that. What dumbass thought up that cool idea to delete everything after you delete something else. It's a forward delete. So if you keep typing on the affected part, it'll delete everything in front of that position.   I've been playing lots of Rachet and Clank: Going Commando and "trying" to finish Final Fantasy X. According to Andrew though, I'm not even half way through the game. Blitzball sucks the rear end of a scorpion! I hate that mini game with a passion! It needs to die a thousand different deaths with excrutiating pain!!!!!  *sigh* I feel better already.
