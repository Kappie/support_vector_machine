I think I'm still catching a bit of "the new guy" cold shoulder from folks, but things were warmer on my second day as opposed to my first. I'm starting to get into the swing of things there.  Tomorrow will be an adventure, I get to work all day and then go to a 3 hour night class. We'll see if I survive or not.  So I realized this weekend that I am one busy sombitch, check it - I have like 4 jobs! First there's the new one - the full time bit at SST, then I have my TA responsibilities, and while that has been scaled down *significantly* from what it was, I still am grading papers and holding one office hour per week. The third is only an hour or two a week, but a responsibility to meet nonetheless, I'm tutoring a person in CS 1 / java programming so they can go to grad school at cornell and have a leg up on the program there.  Finally, i'm still doing the game dev thing, which rocks by the way, and I really hope something more could come of that.  Heck, maybe our game wil be a hit, and they can afford to hire some full timers, like me ;).  So anyways, add them up, that's 4 jobs.  plus a night course for grad school, plus family commitments, ACM presidency, 2 dogs, and a new gamecube (heh).    Man, I can't wait for the semester to end, that'll help bunches. Think I'll leave this one short, it's late and this old working stiff needs to go to bed so he can get up at a decent hour tomorrow.  Later. Phil.
