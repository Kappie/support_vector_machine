Those who stands up agianst these activities they are being crushed with the help of mafias and few corrupted cops. They are wiping of the green forests and putting a big question mark against the environment!!!  That's something really sad to know. How can a person be so selfish.  What are we doing....???? We are just spectators to such kind of events happening around us...!!!  Anyways forget it. Let's gear up for Republic Day's celebration. Who cares what happens with our own country.
