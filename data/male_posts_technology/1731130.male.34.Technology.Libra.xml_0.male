Well, usually mixed in your X-Men issue 114, between ads for X-ray specs and fake vomit would have been an invitation into the wonderful world of Amazing Live Sea-Monkeys!  Probably, you disregarded this as nonsense aimed at impressionable kids who didn't appreciate biological science like you do. Monkeys do not grow from sachets of powder nor live underwater. You would skip straight to the x-ray specs and fake vomit.  Sea Monkeys are, however, a breed of brine shrimp and although the similarity with monkeys is massively overstated, they do in fact grow from sachets and live underwater. Best of all, in keeping with the retro wave sweeping us, Sea Monkeys are enjoying a resurgance.  Link:  Sea-Monkeys.com
