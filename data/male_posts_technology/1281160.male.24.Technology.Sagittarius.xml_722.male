So dont mistake them to be works of mine! And apart from that there will also be articles which are not exactly related to English literature, but then they are all time interesting to read too! So enjoy reading them all and i will be updating them as and when required unlike flowers blog where i will try to update everyweek.   Valli, Ganesh is also cominga! good! hope u people to have a nice time here....  And kavi, answer to ur question of how i do get time?

And need not say, Srini always backs me when i start such works and encourages me at any cost. Infact he is the one who makes me do this u can say! Now got it?!  What? vijay babu has mailed ua kavi? y not to the blog? Vijay idhu sari illa.  Thanx ganesh for ur words and hope to see the snaps soon!   Hei guys i went to Sanjay Subramanyan's (renowned vocalist in Carnatic Music)concert yesterday u know. Very nice his voice is! ya , the auditorium was jam packed and when we went, there was no seat and can u imagine, people were sitting in the pathway and on the stage-near the performer, outside the auditorium-in the verandah, standing at the entrance of the auditorium and in almost all places. We too sat in the pathway and listenend. It was a different experience sitting there and listening. We sat in the pathway at the center and so could clearly see him. His gestures are funny but at the same time are pleasant too. Something different it was for me! Enjoyed it like anything! Ya both music and his gestures.  What Mahen any more blogs on Five sense or  Ok guys, i will blog later bye for now
