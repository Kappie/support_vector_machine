This comes with great timing as I'm leaving for a bachelor party in Chicago to celebrate my good buddy Dave's (the creator of the pants naming convention) slow but sure walk towards the plank that is his wedding. We travel half way across the country to make sure that good ole Dave feels like he "got it all in" before he plunges into the dark abyss that is marriage. There will be 8 doods in 2 hotel rooms. Two day affair, so sleep and a change of clothes is optional. I'm thinking bout just grabbing my drinking helmet and a change of sox and undies and hitting it. I've already retained a lawyer in the Chicago area and pre-paid my bail for any kind of drunken jailable offense. Hopefully I wont need it, but hey, who am I trying to fool.   So friends, as I dive into my 4th week straight of not being at home with my beloved Miss Pants, I look forward to divulging to you all ofthe details that I'm allowed to share (hey, bachelor party...some shit that happens in Chicago dies in Chicago). I bid you all a good weekend.    For those of you looking for a place to rob, I will be out of town from Friday morning till Sunday night! I keep most valuables under the bed and in the closet, so do forget to check there.    Cheers!
