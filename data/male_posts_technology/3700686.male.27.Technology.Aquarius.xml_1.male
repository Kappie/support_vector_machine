Net-net, continue with whatever you were doing prior to getting into the IITs, for the next 4 years and you will do fine. Once you get adventurous, and try to have fun, you end up paying for it with low GPAs. The first sem defines your persona for the next 3 and a half years. That also includes the friends you make or don't make and what the Profs think of you.....  Ends up rather well, with the forgiveness element of the "system" helping to salvage the careers of the maverics Ryan, Hari and Alok. The book is a narration of events at the IIT Delhi campus by Hari, with a chapter each by the others.  I found Hari's character rather remorseless and insensitive. Ryan is a guy who lives for his friends, and Alok is a whiner who has no choice but to live for his family.  I guess if this gets into the hands of wannabe IITians, they just may think twice about joining .....
