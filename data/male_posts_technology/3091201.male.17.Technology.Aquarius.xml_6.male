We are working on what we can do for A's For Africa there.  We are also contacting a local radio host in the Waynesboro Area.  Her name is Delilah, she has her own program 7pm-12am Monday through Friday.  Why are we contacting her you ask, well does is astonish you that she is taking a trip to Africa herself.  Go visit her site to learn more about her trip www.radiodelilah.com.  I am working to see if she can put us on the  air or help us in anyway, like being a resource person.  Cross your fingers that she e-mails me  back and says "Yes I can help you guys"  Watch for more updates about this.
