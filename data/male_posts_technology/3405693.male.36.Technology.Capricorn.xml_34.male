If you don't live in a place with a Keg, basically it's a fairly high end but not stuffy steak joint; fantastic food and cool ambience...great place for a date, although dinner for two will cost the better part of 100 bux with drinks added.  The dining room is very dark with fireplaces going and somewhat private booths.  Dark wood paneling, dark leather seats, black painted walls and dim lights all add to the feeling of being alone in a crowd in The Keg.  I ordered a 12 oz. New York Peppercorn steak cooked medium with garlic mashed potatos, and it was near perfect.  I ordered a bottle of Australian red (um...shoot can't remember the name right now cuz i'm bloated and full and thinking slowly...but the yellow label one...they make a black and red label too) that was fantastic; nice nose, dry but with a peppery slightly fruity taste.  One of my favorite wines, and I order it often.  You can buy the red and black labels in the local liquor stores, but the yellow u can only find in wine stores or restaurants.  Shame, cuz it is by far the best of them all.  We finished our dinner off with a Keg Billy Miner Pie... basically a half liter of coffee flavoured ice cream covered in hot fudge sauce, caramel sauce, and sliced pecans on a sugar crust and in a 6 inch high wedge shape.  I always get that at the keg because it is one of the most incredible and decadent desserts around and I much love it.  And it was as good as always... :D  Anyways, we walked home after dinner, and right outside the back door to our apartment complex there was a squirrel sitting on the sidewalk.  At first I was all like "awww look at the little squirrel doorman come to greet us" but then I noticed that he (she?) didn't skitter away as I approached.  And if you have squirrels in your neighbourhood you know that they always skitter away...hence the term "squirrely".  The poor little guy was definitely alive, but he was obviously in distress.  My first thought was that he'd been hit by a car, but there was no blood or anything, no leaky bits at all.  He seemed to be trying to hide behind his tail.  As he watched me with grave interest I got a little closer to see if I could discern what was wrong.  It made him a little jumpy, and he tried again to hide under his bushy little tail, nearly falling over in the process.    This little grey squirrel was breathing quite quickly and shallowly, and I just didn't know what to do.  Does one call the SPCA in this kind of case?  I mean, seriously in the grand scheme of things a squirrel is considered vermin in the city; would they just tell me to bonk him on the head and put him out of his misery or kick him to the curb for the garbage man to collect when he finally jumped off this realm?  My heart really went out to him; he was hurting, he was alone, and it was starting to rain a bit.  I thought maybe i should grab a box and put some peanut butter in it and take him inside...but if he has a back injury am I doing more harm than good? Also, wouldn't our two cats just eat him?  Cuz really, that's what cats do with rodents that are smaller than them.  What what what??  So I left him there.  With a somewhat heavy heart I opened the door and went into the complex, and left him there.  I started to think about what may be wrong with him; did he get bit by a coyote? Partially run over?  Did he crawl into some junkie's hole and get punted out?  Was he poisoned by some nasty ass person with a garden and no sense of fairness to nature?  And then it hit me...maybe he isn't a he...maybe he's a she and about to have more little squirrels.  Now, one thing we don't particularly need in downtown vancouver is more squirrels, but it was a much more positive spin on the situation.  After a little while I couldn't deal with the curiosity and the sympathy I had for this small wild creature any more...I went back out to check on him.  This was probably 45 minutes later.  Well...sadly, he was gone.  Not gone as in dead, but gone as in no longer in that place.  I looked around and didn't see him anywhere, didn't see any tracks or anything (yeah, that's me, the great hunter tracker...), no smushed grass where he may have dragged his weary carcass...no sign at all.  Now, my apartment is right close to that back door, and if anyone had come in there I would have heard it...and no one did.  So I'm gonna assume it was a momma squirrel on her way to a nest to give birth or something.  That's less depressing than thinking he got grabbed by a hawk as he was helpless there.  I wonder why he chose my doorway at that particular time to have his situation, whatever it was.  Was it an omen?  A sign?  A sad coincidence?  A reminder from the powers that be that my trivial little issues are pretty tame in comparison to the struggles of living in the wild?  A test of some kind?  I don't know...perhaps I am reading too much into it.  All I know for sure is that little squirrel spoke to me quite loudly in the moment or two we shared looking into each other's eyes.  Be well, little grey squirrel, wherever tonights journey took you.
