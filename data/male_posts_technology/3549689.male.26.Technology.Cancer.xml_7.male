This  environment , basically comprises of the following:      Emacs (my editor of choice) set up with the JDEE, GNUClient, Save-Desktop, and a variety of key-bindings I've got used to over the years.     WinCVS     The latest JDK      Tomcat (Java Servlet Container from Apache - also the reference implementation of the Servlet/JSP spec)      JBoss (Open Source J2EE server)      Ant (Apache's Java build system - open source)      Keyboard-accessible shortcuts for starting various Windows programs     Cygwin (Open source Unix emulator for Windows)   Cygwin/X - to run GUI Linux apps on my Windows box instead of accessing a Linux PC over telnet   This environment, depends on the following infrastructure being available on the network:       1 Linux PC (preferably the latest version of RHL/Fedora)   CVS on Linux (I prefer it that way. Allows a lot of server-side scripting, which I haven't figured out for Windows yet)     1 Database server (I've chosen MySQL for now, to run on the Linux box)   Since the backup of my Emacs installation (mainly the .emacs file, but also the specific versions of the various packages that I'd downloaded at various points of time) is in some CD that I currently don't know the location of, and the PC I'm using was previously used by another experimentation-crazy colleague, I have a box that is far from the clean-room-type environment I like to start with, and I've had to start from scratch to set up my so-called  environment .  I'll be blogging here over the next few days about my progress, and also the various bottle-necks I run into. Hopefully it'll be helpful to some of you out there, and at the very least, will help me set it up again at some point in the future when I once again, lose my backup...
