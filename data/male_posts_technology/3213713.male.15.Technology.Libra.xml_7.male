Then, she pulled me outta bed and forced me into the bathroom :s. Neways, I had a bath. Drank some milk and sat on the pc. And wat do i see... msgs. I has set a comeback msg for Farazeh. She read it but didnt read that it said:  auto-responder ... heheheh. Like everyone else... she said... u there?? lol. Neways. After that, mamu came to pick us up. And so we went to Nani ghar.  When i got there, I watched TV for a while. Then, I got so sleepy that I almost fell off the sofa. My mom shook me and told me to have lunch first... hehheh. I quickly had lunch and then left to sleep. I went to my mamu's room and lay down on the floor. At once, I was asleep. At bout 5:30... i felt something jumping on me. As i openend my eyes... it was my mamu' daughter, Maira... lol. She was literally pulling my hair and saying: "Uthooaaaa!!" heheheh. Since i couldnt resist her, i had to get up. I washed my face and went out. Ahsan called just then. As i took the phone, he started yelling: "Kutte... tu ne kitna sona he... tujhe yaad nhin tu ne mere saath jana tha??!!" heheheh. I had forgotten that I had to go the tution with him. But, when i reminded him that he was to give me a treat after that, he started making excuses... as always. Saale ko mein ne galiyaan bhi dein... kehta he... "aakhir mein hoon to sheikh hi na"... hahahah. Neways, he said that he would call me after getting back bcz he had to give me some really good news. Then, I had milk and went to the barber's to get a haircut. I told him to just trim the hair. He cut off almost everything. End Result: My hair wont sit down now! :s . When I got back, pata challa keh paani hi band he :S. Then, I went and turned on the pc. Came online after repeated attempts to connect. Neways, went to the forum and posted. Chatted, as always :p. Since no one else was online, I went off. Then, I watched the movie "Girlfriend". Interesting... but i got bored after the middle part. Switched to friends then. Watched it till 9. Then, went and took a bath. Called Ahsan after that. He was busy doin somethin and said that he'll call back. But he didnt! :@ . Then, I read Newsweek. Abu came. We had dinner. Watched those Star Plus soaps :s. Had some mangoes. Then, we left.  I got back at bout 12. Changed. And since then ive been online. Chatting and now, blogging. Mom has been telling me to go to sleep... but im still lingering on :p. Neways, this sums up the day, ciao!
