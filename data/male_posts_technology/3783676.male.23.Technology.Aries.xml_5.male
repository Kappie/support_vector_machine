This time, I spent the night at her place. Heh heh :-) and also, for a change, she showed me! Man, did I get a workout! She smoked a spliff before we jumped into bed, and prior to that, she had warned me that she gets FUCKING horny when she smokes. So I thought, sweet, bonus for me! Little did I know how horny she gets! Man oh man, she really made me sweat!  So anyway, after mind blowing, life altering sex... we fall asleep. I wake up at about 3 in the morning to quite a surprise :-P Her kid (18 months old), is lodged firmly in between my chest and arm with his hand on my face. The last thing you expect at 3 in the morning after having unbelievable sex is to have a little baby lying on you!!  So at the end of the day, I'm quite happy with this chicken... Very nice, down to earth, and rather impressed with me and my performance in the bedroom ;-) All the better for me!! Heh heh :-)   Oh, I nearly forgot, yesterday, I'm relaxing in my bed, sort of trying to catch a bit of shuteye around 3 in the afternoon :-P And I get a call from a lovely lady I know in Durban. Now to hear her voice on the other side of the phone was surprising to say the least, cause we never had anything going between us. I think she wants something to happen between us, but alas, once again, she has a child and is also going through a divorce at the moment, although, she might be over it by now, but I don't know. Anyway, back to the point, she actually called to see how I was doing... Which again, is surprising... Long story short, it might be something to look at. Although, I need to decide whether I want to jeopardise what I have with the current chicken to go after and shag this other one... It is highly unlikely that one will ever meet the other on a random occasion, but you know how these things get. By some fluke or undeniable twist of fate, they will see each other, or find out about each other somehow. Two shags is enough for now. I can't bring myself to break off my other shag at the moment. We been through alot together and I really enjoy fucking her brains out. And I think it would break her heart to let me go. Oh well, it will have to happen sometime. But not just yet ;-)  Heh heh :-) Memory is a funny thing ey? Context man, CONTEXT!! So I went to an interview today... Normally when you go for interviews you get butterflies and what not. I didn't get them today, there was a severe lack of insects in my tummy. So I meet with the manager of this place and listen to what he has to say... I tell him what I can do and what I expect, and how much MONEY I want out of it... He then proceeds to walk me around the company, introducing me to everyone explaining that I'm thinking about joining the company. Now how weird is that? I mean, I just been in an interview for like 30 minutes and now I'm being introduced to everyone? Ok, whatever... So once its all over, he reckons I must go home and think about whether or not I want to join the company. I'm already quite keen, cause now my savings account looks like the grand canyon :-( So tomorrow I phone, say I am keen, meet with the Managing Director, and discuss my renumeration package... and viola, I have a job. Funny how some people battle for jobs and this one fell right into my lap! Heh heh :-) Some people are just lucky I guess, but then again, I think luck left a week or two ago, I reckon its all skill baby, yeah!
