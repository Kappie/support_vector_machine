It was an 8 oclock game and I couldnt help but notice everyone looking at their watches 20 minutes prior of end game. The game last for 1 hour. Fortunately this is during Summer but it's taking a toll. The kids are still sleeping and it's nearly 8 a.m. Normally they would be up by 6:30 easily.   Had to take the trash out this morning and it's pouring down rain here. A couple of mothers, my wife included, was hoping the T-ball game would be rained out but it waited till early morning. Now it looks like a typhoon out there. I showered,ect already and after taking the trash out had to redress, being drenched. Oh well.   I appreciate everyone's feedback on the blog, it's nice to know I am not the only one insane. Yes, I am drinking my coffee already. And yes, yesterday, I continued to pee my brains out. If nothing else, my kidneys are getting a good cleansing.   Yesterday at work, it seemed like another Monday. Man it was crazy, I couldnt leave till after 6 p.m., starting at 8. It made for a long day but it went by pretty fast, due to the  busyness.
