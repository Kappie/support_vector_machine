Due to life and a RRG trip, I have been off running for a week but I finally got back in the saddle again last night for a glorious 4 miles through some of my old paths of younger years.  I visited "The Mother" in Beckett and ran the trail there.  It took me back to many years spent biking and rollerblading up and down those paths and at times in my run I'm sure I wished that I was on a bike or had rollerblades on.  Truly it was a great run.  I was able to start slow with iPod in hand and tunes jamming in my ear.  I let my body warm back up to running and did my best to not look goofy for the first mile.  By miles 2 and 3 I had broken into regular stride of a sub-9 minute pace and I felt wonderful.  The weather was a perfect fall day (in July?) and there was a chilly wind keeping me from getting too hot.  By mile 4, I decided to kick it up a little and I opened up to a 8 or sub-8 minute pace.  The only drawback to running in a familiar place is the opportunity to see friends from the past.  A half mile from the end when I was in full stride, I saw friend's mother from childhood and stopped to talk.  It was wonderful to see her but I was a little upset about having to stop right in the middle of my final push.  It was okay.  The run was pretty much over so I took a 4-5 minute break to talk to her, then plodded out the final half mile never to recover my pace.  As much as I try to fight it, I can't help but realize it is so much easier for me to run after work in the evening sometime.  My body is usually just too tired in the mornings so there may be a slight shift in training and schedule to accomodate for that.  Okay enough for today barring the final thought.  For a final thought today, some lyrics that mimic what my mind has had to tell my body at times when I think I'm hurt or don't want to keep going. You're alright There's nothing wrong Self sufficience please! And get to work  Have a great week and look for more updates soon! TW
