Paul, Urm yea Tom, a public thanks to you and Snooboo.com for brightening up my day yesterday with the polar bears and badgers, graphics. Thankyou. My day today has been better, things are starting to look up, went out with the woman, to London, fun. Had dinner with her and her parents, urm funny. And by the way i am bringing her to Andys party, if anyone wants to meet her, and you are invited (if you arnt invited, go and be nice to Andy) We will be there.  Today has had a positive effect on both my life and the lives of others close to me, i am happy once more. Although I am sure that will change when i walk into school tommrow.  See you all soon. Dave
