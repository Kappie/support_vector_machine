It's going pretty slow, i'm just bashing out a rough-in of a set from the movie Amelie.  Listening to some frou frou mp3's.  I had never heard of this band before i went to see Shrek2.  They do a cover of Holding out for a Hero on that soundtrack.  The lead singer's voice is just awesome.    Ginny, my kitten, is deciding to visit me every once in a while as i work.  I think she's bored and i'm not giving her much in the way of attention.  I also watched  urlLink Monsters Inc.  tonight for probably the tenth time.  This movie is one of their best IMHO.    This is a pretty lax post tonight, cause i'm in a pretty lax mood.  I'm out.
