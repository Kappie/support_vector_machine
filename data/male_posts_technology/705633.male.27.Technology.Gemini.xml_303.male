On the way they stopped at a Yorkie Bar. He had a Rum and Butter. She had a Wine Gum.    He asked her name. She said Polo, I'm the one with the hole. (But I'm the one with the Nuts he thought) Then he touched her Milky Way. They checked in and went straight to the bedroom. Mr Cadbury turned out the  light for a bit of Black Magic. It wasn't long before he slipped his hand into her Snickers and felt the contrast of her Double Decker. Then he Showed her his Curly Wurly. But Ms Rowntree wasn't keen as she already had a few Jelly Babies, So she let him take a trip down Bourneville Boulevard. He was pleased as he always fancied a bit of Fudge nudging. It was a Magic Moment as she let out of scream of Turkish Delight.    When he Came out his Fun Sized Mars Bar felt a bit Crunchie. She wanted more but he Decided to take a Time Out. However, he noticed her Pink Wafers looked very appetising. So he did a Twirl and had a Picnic in her Sherbert. At the same time he gave her a Gob Stopper!      Unfortunately Mr Cadbury had to go home to his wife Caramel. Sadly, he was soon to discover he had caught V.D. It turns out Ms Rowntree had a Box of Assorted Creams. She really had been with All Sorts.
