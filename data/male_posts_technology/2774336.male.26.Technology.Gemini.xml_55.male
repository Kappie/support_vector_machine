       Intestinal Cramping 

    

     

 

 

 I still haven't eaten much today.  My intestines are cramping off and on.  Its not severe but it isn't background discomfort either. 

  Update:  It was likely 8:00 pm before the mild pain in my abdomen went away.  The rest of this evening was off and on belching and a burining throat.  I had a little rice tonight for dinner.
