Been busy with wedding plans, and i am really starting to get nervous, as Dennis put it so elegantly last week there are "Min Dae". I just wish it was over already so that i can start saving money again, you really do not realise how expensive these things are until you have to pay for one...  Last weekend I was in Scotland, to pick up my kilt, actually looks very nice, well chuffed with it, the tartan is "McHardy Ancient". The tartan, which had to be specially woven, as it is not freely available, seemed to be a bit of a talking point as a few ladies were called into have a look when i tried it on, they were all in agreement that it looked very good. Also bought all the other goodies i.e. a wee dagger, shoes with incredibly long laces and my shirt and tie. My mom bought me my "badgers handbag" for christmas so... am pretty much all sorted now.  The shoes heels are a bit higher than i am used to so they hurt my arches, am wearing them now in the evenings to break them in...  This weekend i went into Town with Jem, her Mum and Shahir, the purpose of the trip was for me to buy Jem's Wedding Jewelry... so mission accomplished... Had a nice lunch at Nando's.  Miko, one of our cat's had three of her teeth out on Friday, so i will be taking her to the vet today for her post-op checkup. We have to give both cat's a seperate diet, will be speaking to the Vet today as it is a nightmare to administer, and we are getting woken up at 3am by hungry cats...  This evening we are going to also have a chat with our photographer, as to what he is piccies he is going to take and in what order, blah blah blah...  Only other news of any vague interest is that a new TV channel lauched today, called  urlLink NSAT , it will cater for all South African Ex-pats, showing South African TV shows, news and sport... one of the "highlights" is "Noot vir Noot", talk about fucking cringe factor. The only things i am looking forward to are the sports and news programmes. Somethings in my opinion should just stay in SA. But i suppose there is a demand as there are 1.4million expats in England, which i am not surprised by at all as virtually everywhere you go you hear South African accents, it is very scary...  anyway....
