I may come back to this post later and update it to be more step-by-step, but as of now, I won't do that. Questions are always welcome, and I'll try my best to keep these posts useful to as many people as possible.   I began using Emacs full-time, in March 2000, so my  .emacs  file had become somewhat large before I lost it. I guess this may be somewhat Greek to some of you, so I'll also give a bit of Emacs history and background information. For the impatient, this post is divided into the following sections. Just click on the one that interests you.   urlLink History and background   urlLink Using Emacs   urlLink Customizing Emacs     History and Background  Emacs, has its roots in Unix, though it started out as a set of macros written in 1976 at MIT by RMS (Richard Stallman) for the editor TECO under ITS on a PDP-10. It soon developed into a customizable editor that can today be used for everything from browsing your harddisk, programming (using practically any programming language ever developed), shell programming, accessing a database (including but not limited to Oracle, DB2, MySQL, SQL Server), version control (using CVS, Clearcase, SourceSafe and other tools), browsing the web, checking your mail, playing tetris, and more! Emacs even doubles up as your psychiatrist! (Help -> Emacs Pschiatrist)  Interested? Well, read on!    Using Emacs  To begin using Emacs (I'm assuming you're using Windows. If you're not, you're probably smart enough to change the below instructions to suit you anyway), you need to do the following:      Download the Emacs installer from http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/windows/emacs/ (download the  fullbin   tar.gz  file)     Extract it (Winzip can extract  tar.gz  files) to a convenient location on your hard-drive like  C:\      Execute   <emacs-folder>\bin\runemacs.exe   to start Emacs.     Once Emacs has started, press  Ctrl-h, t  to start the tutorial     Read the tutorial and follow it. This will teach you basic navigation within emacs - which is very different from how you normally do it in Windows. For example, the standard Ctrl-X, Ctrl-V for Copy/Paste doesn't work in Emacs by default. You can make it work, and there are packages like  cua.el  which enable a large number of windows-type key-bindings, but I don't recommend them. If you're using Emacs, you might as well get used to the default key-bindings, because sooner or later you  will  fall in love with them.     Read the manual. This is accessible from the menu at Help->Read The Emacs Manual.      Use Emacs as your editor exclusively for a few weeks (it took me around a month to become fully productive on Emacs with Java. This was mainly because of the time it took me to set up JDEE, so it might not be so bad for you if I can document the JDEE part on this blog). You might be tempted, because of the steep learning curve, to forget about the whole exercise. However, if you are patient, the rewards are indeed great.       Customizing Emacs  The Emacs initialization file - which is what you use to customize Emacs to work the way you want, is called ".emacs". You cannot create a file with this name directly in Windows, so you'll need to create it from within Emacs itself. (The alternative is to call the file "_emacs", but since you  can  create a .emacs file, this is no longer necessary). The location of this file, is your HOME directory. To find out the location of your HOME directory, type the following in a freshly opened command prompt (Type "cmd" under Start->Run, or "command.com" if you are using Windows 9x/Me).   prompt> echo %HOME%   If it gives you blank output, then you can assume this to be  C:\ . The HOME environment variable is not commonly found on Windows systems, but is important in the Unix World. Unixy applications assume a location of C:\ if one is not defined in your Environment Variable list.  One of the first things I do when I download Emacs and start with a new .emacs, is add these entries -    (setq default-frame-alist         '((top . 0)           (left . 190)           (width . 130)           (height . 66)           (font . "-outline-Lucida Console-normal-r-normal-normal-12-90-96-96-c-*-iso10646-1")       )         )    (global-set-key (quote [f3]) (quote other-window))   (global-set-key (quote [home]) (quote beginning-of-buffer))   (global-set-key (quote [end]) (quote end-of-buffer))   (global-set-key (quote [C-M-down]) (quote View-scroll-line-forward))   (global-set-key (quote [C-M-up]) (quote View-scroll-line-backward))    I've got quite used to them, and find them indispensible. The first bit, resizes and positions my emacs window on startup, and sets my default font to Lucida-Console, with a font size of 9. This is quite small but I have a large monitor, so you might want to decide what your favourite font and size are. To find out the right string for your font, do this.      Paste this in your *scratch* buffer:  (insert (prin1-to-string (w32-select-font)))       Keep the cursor at the end of the line that you just pasted, and press Ctrl-J. This will pop up a Font-selection dialog     Select the font, size and style of your choice.     Press Ok.     The string that Emacs pastes back in the *scratch* buffer, is the full name of your font.    For the resizing and positioning of the Emacs window, you can either delete those sections, or experiment and decide what works for you. The top and left parameters are pixel values, whereas width and height are measured in number of characters in your selected font.  The next bit from my  .emacs  file sets up my favourite key-bindings.  F3 , is the key I use to change buffers with a single key. The standard Emacs shortcut for this is  C-x o .  The  Home  key on Unix and older versions of Emacs on Windows takes you to the beginning of the file, and the  End  key takes you to the end of the file. In Windows editors, the standard behaviour is to take you to the beginning or the end of the line. I like the way Unix works, and having it behave differently on Windows confuses me when I have to work on a Linux machine. So I set these keys up appropriately. The last two, are for scrolling a file one line at a time, instead of by page. I like the Ctrl-Alt-Up and Ctrl-Alt-Down keys for this.  I also customize the following variables ( M-x customize-variable ):       blink-cursor  to  nil         delete-selection-mode  to  t       global-font-lock-mode  to  t       transient-mark-mode  to  t     The first turns off the blinking of the cursor, the second allows me to delete any selected text in one stroke using the  Del  key, the third turns on syntax-specific colouring for recognized file-types, and the last allows me to see selected text as highlighted.  Setting up Emacs with JDEE, Cygwin and other cool tools will be covered in future posts.  More soon.
