I like going at 60kmph(  I was wondering why people like riding fast. For some, it's the sheer thrill of living on the edge. For some, it's an ego problem.  I received a mail from Swami a few days back.  He explains this in his rather inimitable style -          ----- Original message ----- From: "Swami Ashwinananda"  To: madrasbulls Date: Fri, 23 Apr 2004 12:45:58 -0000 Subject: Madbull Mail - To do, or to outdo?  That is the question this motorcycling fraternity needs to ask  itself.  I was riding back home from work recently, and I found I was  following a guy on a Thunderbird, who was thumping along at a sedate  pace, and wearing a helmet. 'Responsible rider' I thought to myself,  making a mental note to look for the Madras Bulls sticker when I got  closer ;-). A stop light on Mount Road turned red, and the gent,  still in front of me, pulled up patiently behind a car, waiting for  the light to turn green. But just as I rolled in to wait behind him,  an auto rickshaw on the right moved up and I had the chance to move  ahead of him in line, and I stopped right at the white line in front  of the other traffic. Within seconds, I heard the sound of a Bullet  engine being revved, some honking, and the guy on the Thunderbird  squeezed through some traffic, an irate auto driver and an old man  on a Kinetic Honda included, just to pull up alongside me. He glared  at me through his helmet visor, then pulled up a little ahead of me,  cutting straight across the line. I thought nothing of it, but  Chennai traffic being what it is, an auto driver and a cyclist soon  followed suit, cutting in even further ahead of him!  When the light turned green, I took off smoothly, and he was stuck  behind the auto driver and cyclist. All the way down Kotturpuram  road, I heard his horn and his engine, and saw his lights flashing  as he tried to make his way through traffic to overtake me. I slowed  down a bit, and he made a wide arc to my right, crossing the yellow  line again, and raced off, thrilled that he had finally overtaken  me... Only to slow down about hundred metres ahead, and look for me  in his mirror. I pulled up, and just as I did so, he took of again,  again slowing down a little ahead and looking for me to follow, this  time narrowly missing a Tata Sierra in the bargain.  I tired of this game rather quickly, and we ran out of road space  too, but he slowed down just enough at the turn for me to catch a  glimpse of the prominent Madras Bulls sticker on the back of his  helmet. My question is this. What did I do to turn a sedate, responsible  rider into a speed-hungry, risk-taking maniac within seconds? I  overtook him. And that, unknown to me, ruffled his ego so badly,  that the evil Mr. Hyde made a sudden appearance, wrangling control  of the bike from gentle Dr. Jekyll, and striking rampant terror into  the hearts of innocent Monday evening home-goers.  We have all given into our egos at times, showing someone what a  Bullet can do, teaching someone a lesson, putting someone in his  place... I myself have written reams of rather ambiguous copy on the  subject, to the delight of some, to the disgust of some.  But I do believe enough can never be said on this topic.  Coming back to my question. To do, or to outdo? It's one thing to ride fast because you like to. It's another to  ride fast because you have to be faster than the other guy. I don't  know how many of you are video game buffs, but I'd urge you to try  this simple experiment. Load up a game of Road Rash or some other  racing simulation that you are familiar with. Ride or drive as well  as you can in qualifying mode, concentrating on nothing but the  track. Note your time. Then, with this time in mind, play again,  again in qualifying mode, trying to beat the time you did first  time. 9 out of 10 times, you won't even get close to your first  attempt. Chances are, you might even fall off or crash in the  attempt to get a better time. Why? Because OUTdoing is always more  difficult than doing. Not to mention much less enjoyable too. And  that was just on a virtual track! Phew!  It's a great thing to have this 'killer instinct' in a game, on a  professional race track, or at work. Being competitive can help you  get ahead in life, and setting yourself targets to beat can give you  tremendous self motivation, a sense of self sufficiency and personal  power. But please don't do it on the road.  And this doesn't have to do with just speed. It's got to do with  ANYTHING you do on the road. Enhance your bike's performance  because you want to. Not because someone else has done something and  you want to outdo him. Travel to far off places because you want to.  Not because someone else has traveled more and you want to outdo  him.  Outdoing has another downside. It's addictive. And that, in itself,  can lead to your own destruction. People who know you have this  thing about outdoing can very easily make you undo yourself.  If the gent who overtook me is reading this, I hope he takes this in  the right spirit. I have no problems with people who ride faster  than me - I can learn a lot from them. I have no problems with  people who have traveled more than me - I can learn a lot from them  too. But I do have a problem with people who want to kill themselves  outdoing people - because I can't learn anything from them. Not that  that type will have anything to teach anyway.  So again, it's up to you. Ask yourself if you do what you do because  you truly want to do it... or because someone else does it better  and that rankles you. And then decide which is more enjoyable, doing  something because you like doing it, or because you have to outdo  someone else at it. Whatever you choose to do (or outdo), all the  best!
