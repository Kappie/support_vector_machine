 I listened to the whole of  urlLink R.E.M.'s "Reveal" . It wasn't easy. I tried a few times before, but didn't succeed. I haven't decided yet if it simply sucks, or good but hard to get used to. I should keep in mind that "Automatic FTP" wasn't so easy for me to get used to either. 
 I'll take the raaaaaaaaaaaaain. The really good song here. But Beachball starts off with a pretty disgusting electrobeat. Then it becomes a faux-latin thing, that  urlLink Yo La Tengo  would do so much better. I should try some 80's R.E.M. 
 The reason i'm listening to it is that i'm home alone. Alone, that is at home with my parents and not with my sweetheart Hadar, with whom i spend almost all my weekends and holidays. On the rare occasions that it happens i am somewhat glad at first for the opportunity to spend some time alone listening to all those CD's i buy, and "scratching my balls", but soon realize how much i miss her. I swear to God (see  urlLink Gen 2:24 ) that i'm not getting this touchy-feely because she might read this.
