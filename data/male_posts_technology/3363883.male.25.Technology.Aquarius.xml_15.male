I think that was fate’s way of luring me into a false sense of security.  I'm now a single man.  Having a Blogspot is a bit weird.  I like to write and I think I'm doing this just as much for my benefit as I'm not sure how many people end up reading these.  As such, I'm not sure if I ever want to go into any gory details.  I'm not so keen on writing anything too personal on the account of  1]embarrasing myself 2]embarrasing anyone else  So on this acount I'll think i'll give just a brief description.  Kristen and I have been going out for the last 4 and half years.  We hit a bit of turmoil in the last year but managed to recover if however ungracfully.  Kristen went back home and for work reasons I decided to stay on for several months.  This has managed to put too much of a strain on the relationship and it's now over.  Full stop.  I’d like to think that we'll stay friends and I guess only time will tell.  I've never met anyone who has undertood me so well.  I wonder if I ever will.  I got to admit, considering she's about 20,000kms away in Oz, I'm taking it far worse than I thought I would have.  Oh well.  Time heals all wounds [apparently] so I'll just keep that in mind.  So now it’s time for a bit of focus on myself.  While we’ve been apart from each other for the last couple of months I never really considered myself as alone.  Now I’m going to have to get used to that feeling.  It’s not very nice.  Sure, I’ve got a load of very cool friends but no-one is on “the level” with me.  I think I’ll be hitting the gym a lot more often and keeping myself particularly busy in the evenings.  I hate having regrets.  I think this is going to be one of the biggies.
