Now both of them have been to the vets, and one of them has to have an operation... he is quite old and it requires a general anesthetic, so its not a good thing.  I also have to have an operation.  I am not old, but paranoid and terrified of death.  It also requires a general anesthetic.  Spooky, huh?  Both occurrences have me worried.  In addition, the cough I have been experiencing for the last 4-5 weeks is still with me, and that is beginning to worry me a great deal as well.  And I think my filling is starting to give up the ghost after about two years or so.  Roleplaying has gone a bit odd again.  As in, its not really happening.  It seems to be not happening more often than not these days.  Even my home game has been in brief hiatus as one of the players has decided to be useless again.  Also, my PC is still terrifying.  Or rather, the spyware and occasional failures that scare the shit out of me are terrifying.  At the very least my PBeM worries are out of the way.  I've also started work on the write-up for my revised "Future Commando" based  GURPS  game that I'd like to run but will never get the chance or indeed the right players.  I'm also getting money now.   Brood War  is going quite well also.  I've reached Protoss Mission 6 again.  Maybe this time I'll try and kill the proto-Overmind.  The Khalis crystal can wait.
