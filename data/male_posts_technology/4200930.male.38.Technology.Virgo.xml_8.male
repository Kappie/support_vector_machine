Complete bollocks is what I say, especially as the majority of people can no longer be arsed voting (me included). Always much better things to do like scratch my arse or watch TV or even surf the net.  I’m not sure of figures here but I’m sure the majority of people of voting age within this country didn’t even vote. The minority of the electorite votes the majority of our MP’s, Local Councillors, and MEP’s into office. I believe when percentages etc are quoted on TV they should give each area a turnout percentage, so people can quite clearly see what is happening in their area.  Why are people disillusioned with politics? Quite an easy answer I feel. Put quite simply we are NOT represented. When was the last time your MP voted with his constituent’s views rather than along party lines? Why do MP’s insist on taking the opposite view of the opposition party rather than going along common sense/ best interests of the country etc? They always manage to agree nice pay rises for themselves! This doesn’t even begin to mention the lies that are told to us by our Prime Minister and other cabinet members. Great war Tony, now that we are aware of the truth are you going to say sorry to Saddam and re-instate him. No, I thought not. (Personally I agreed with the war but not necessarily the application or tactics deployed).  Before the so-called Labour reforms the original members of the House of Lords didn’t have a political axe to grind. Now more and more business friends of Tony and other parties are purchasing peerages (sorry nominated by political parties) maybe they will go the same way.  Nu-Labour, stands for Nu-Fascism, Nu-Corruption and Nu-Taxes more like.
