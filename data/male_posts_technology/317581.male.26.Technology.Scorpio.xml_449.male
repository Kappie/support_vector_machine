At times I will be outrageous party Tim, and at other times I'll be quiet introspective Tim. It's a cycle. Ups and downs. I first heard the idea of our selfs as cycles in Highschool, from a man I trully respect and value the opinion of.  So I'm introspective Tim today. Unfortunately I have the little motivation to leave the hizouse these days. Which means my friends are missing me:(  Piano lessons are going great. I'm going to get my book of jewels songs on piano. So that's exciting. I'm going to idaho on wednesday to drive Cindy and bubba fett back to seattle.  So that's something. I got the new outkast, ludacris, and Meat loaf on CD from bestbuy today. Went to the JCPenny and got flannel sheets.  It is officially freezing in washington. It snowed this morning around 8am for about half an hour. I was asleep, of course, but I heard about it.   There was a birthday party last night. I didn't bring a present:( and I didn't give a present.  I did promote our party on the 15th, but that's not saying much.  I need a piano or at least a weighted keyboard to practice on:( so much to spend my money on. So little money.   Part of me wants to be a contributing part of society, part of me just wants to sit back and make snide remarks. Part of me wants a girlfriend so bad. Part of me wants someone to fuck. Part of me cares so much. Part of me doesn't care at all. Part of me wants a "nice" girl. Part of me wants a girl to tell me how to please her. Part of me wants to be good with the ladies. Part of me wants the ladies to see what's good in me and want to have that.  Part of me feels like Charlie Kaufman in Adaptation. Part of me feels like Barry Egan in Punch-drunk love.  That is enough for now... Back to Xenocide by Orson Scott Card. Peace-
