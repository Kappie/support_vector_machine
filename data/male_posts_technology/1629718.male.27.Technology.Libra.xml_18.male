If so don't be fooled, there's a drink even higher up on the tot'em pole then that for sending your energy to another planet, hell even my fiance' thinks so.  I would have to rank a few drinks on the market in this order:  1 - Monster Energy (a pounding hellish 2000+ MG of caffine per drink, not more then 3 a day recommended) ***** 5/5 -- Made me wanna climb a friggen wall, then a moutain, then the tv, and then go fix my car when I know nothing about mechanics - Cost $2.20 for 40 Oz Can (Woohoo!)  2 - MT Dew Amp - **** 5/5 - Peaceful Luv Energy Drink - Sure a cheap chip off of monster energy once again, but it does the job, and it's 20 cents less! , still makes me do nutty things, hmmm wonder if this is addictive? Cost = $1.99 for 8.4 Oz Can (Rippoff?)  3 - Pure Luv Mini - **** 4/5 - Mini size of pure love, you can score two for like $1.99, not a bad deal, better hose down both of em they seem to sweeten the kick, sadly these had only  75 mg of caffine in each can :(   4 - Red Bull - ** 2/5 - Wtf is this junk? This can't even spark my mind, nor send me racing through a cardboard box, I'v had more energy nibblin on friggen sour patchies with my fiance at midnight half awake. This stuff should be labeled - Kiddie Sooper Shooter Drink and given at McDonald's in their kiddie meals. And for $2.XX !! It's not worth it. Cost = $1.99 8.4 Oz Can.  Well that concludes my day of rantin on about energy drinks...maybe i'll post more later. Maybe I won't ..ah what the hell...  W|CKED
