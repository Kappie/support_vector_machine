It has a very nice and simple interface, it loads quickly, and best of all it has a gigabyte of storage.  For any non-business email user, a gigabyte is enough space to store years of email.  It definately blows hotmail and yahoo mail out of the water.  I predict that either the competition makes drastic changes to improve it's offerings, or they start to lose a lot of customers.  Using the new gmail service is pretty exciting because of the options it has.  It reminds me of how excited I was to get my first email address from hotmail back in 1998.  Ya, I am a geek.
