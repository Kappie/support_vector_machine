It has a ton of large companies here; Brochade, McData, eBay, Teradata, etc.  The thing is, I used to work in Irvine, CA - which is in Orange County in SoCal - and I can't really tell the difference between them.  Other than the fact that there are more pine trees, gray days and people listening to NPR up here, they are exactly the same.    Okay, so it's a Cali thing.  Right?  Nope.  The area north of Pheonix, AZ around Scottsdale along the 101 is much the same.  The same Starbucks, Rubios, juice bar, Old Navy, In-n-Out, Krispy Creme, megaplexed sprawl malls.  Although, there is no confusing the surroundings with Irvine or Santa Clara - and it's juuuuuust a bit hotter in the summer time.    So... who came up with the "instant 'burb" formula?
