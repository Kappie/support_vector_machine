I saw this really crazy converted van that was cut in half and welded shut on the cut end to make a trailer.  Bizarre.  Belted some golf balls around with my dad on Sunday afternoon.  They really do have a big yard.  Went to a bingo game in New Waterford, i'm not that afraid to admit it was a pretty good time.  Drove back today, Monday, and got back just in time to see Shrek2 with some friends.  HILARIOUS...Puss in Boots alone is worth the price of a ticket.  This is one rambling post this time, but i'm trying to rehash 3 days before going to bed..and i'm failing miserably.  So without butchering anymore stories here,  I'm out.
