The first one will be  A+ , which most people think is a joke.   I figure I can get this certification with no training.  It covers basic hardware skills and DOS/Windows skills.  The hardware portion is as basic as "Is this a power supply or a video card?", but gets a bit more difficult with "Is this RAM chip ECC or not?".  What they call the Operating Systems Technology is just an overview of DOS/NT/Win9x/Win2K.  The OS exam covers basic Windows installation, troubleshooting and networking.  If I can't pass these tests, my legacy as a failure will go down in history.  If (once) I pass these exams, I will try my hand at something actually difficult.  Too bad there isn't a generic sysadmin exam.  There are exams for  urlLink linux sysadmin ,  Redhat sysadmin ,  urlLink Solaris sysadmin , and  urlLink AIX sysadmin .  If there was a BSD sysadmin cert, I would be all over it.
