Work hard, earn lots of bucks and party hard. The office is on MG Road, its as famous here as the Silk Route is in the Eastern World. Banks, companies, malls, theaters, Dominos, Pizza Corner, stolen goods market, smuggled goods market, Baristas, Cafe Coffee Days, book shops, video game parlors and of course a lot of indian population - a good big package of things compressed on to a long road. (no doubt roads are lifelines of a country)    The weather in Bglore is much like that in Europe, only the traffic is much more and lot more indisciplined. The first Saturday night I ended up buying a Tag Heuer watch.... a cheap imitation of course ;-). Bglore is a young city with fast life and a hubbabub of multicultural torrents mingling with each other. Its like a young teenager trying to look cool too fast, living life in the fast lane but only his style is cramped the lack of space and bad roads. In every other corner u would find a tech company, each one trying to become a behemoth - a collective effort though disconnected that might turn Bglore into a spank new version of Silicon Valley, outside the US of A.
