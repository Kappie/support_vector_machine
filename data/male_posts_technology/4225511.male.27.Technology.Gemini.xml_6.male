I was going to put the links on a page and put it on one of my sites, but I'll have trouble keeping a single most updated version without confusion.  So here we go :)   I was browsing  urlLink nasioc  and somebody was asking about those white lights (with a blue film).  I came across a very good read a while ago, and learned a lot from it.  See the link below:  urlLink http://www.danielsternlighting.com/tech/bulbs/blue/bad/bad.html   Modding my car has been a very good learning experience, although it's uhh... quite expensive.
