I will be using a few of them this coming week talking about: - Organizing the world between Christ followers, nominal Christians and the unreached - Tribal, Hindu, Unreligious, Muslim, Buddhist (notice that when you put these world religion breakdowns together in this order, it makes the word 'thumb'.  Cool eh?  Not my idea - I got it from one of the Infobytes) - What is a people group? - What is the 10/40 window? - The Biblical Basis for missions We'll see how it goes.  I've also got to line up a worship leader, snacks and some follow up with their individual mission teams.
