It is many years since I have spent any time watching television  and can truly say I do not miss it. In the past I have been a TV addict  until I stopped and thought about the amount of time it wastes ang the crap that  is on. Here in NZ the level of advertising time crammed into the  programming is extreme. I believe that with Video/DVD it allows me to choose  what to watch and when and there are no adds. I also get out to the movie  theatre occasionally - often just going out on my own because I am too  disorganised to plan in advance -if our children are settled into bed at a  reasonable hour (8pmish) and my Wife is available to stay with the  themthenI mightdecide to go out to catch a movie.          I have really been enjoying SiFis lately - Vanilla  Sky, Minority Report, Truman Show, S1mone, Gattaca, Blade Runner - directors  cut, Being John Malcovich.
