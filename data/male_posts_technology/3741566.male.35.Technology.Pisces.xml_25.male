By the time I was one, the father had left and the mother had dropped me off with her mother to raise and look after. About the age of five, that same mother figured she'd give it a shot and I was moved to South Florida.  Move forward eleven years and you find me again in South Florida after having lived in the Atlanta area with my mothers third try at a husband. She left him and moved to Ft. Lauderdale. I'll have to leave out the specifics of what was going on during all this. I think that will be an entirely different blog.  Move forward to December 1994, and I am getting married to Scottee in Melbourne Florida. One child Auston comes along in 1998 and a the second child Sammie enters in 2001. Still married in 2004.  Spring time close to summer in San Jose California found me hiring a very beautiful woman named Wendy as our companies PR manager. My relationship with Wendy turns from work to friends within a few months. July 2004 and Wendy meets my wife Scottee and things get very interesting from there.   Ok that is the short draft of how I got to be here. I'll be writing a lot from here on out about my current situation as well as posting about the past. So much to tell and so little room to tell it in.  Bye for now good readers.....AJ
