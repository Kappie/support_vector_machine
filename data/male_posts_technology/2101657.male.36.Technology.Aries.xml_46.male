We started out with a hike over to Wendy's for a quick supper, then it was a hike back to the track, for a tour of the track it self.  It was actually quite interesting.    We then went back to the camp area, and got organized. Then some of the boys wanted to go back and sit out in the bleachers (free pop!) and see what it was like to watch the dogs go zipping by.  After sitting for 2 races, we decided to head back out to our camp site, setup some tents, and then the boys procedded to play Capture the Flag with glow sticks.  I think that was Oldest Son's© favorite part of the camp out.  He got to help setup a Eureka Timerline two man tent and spent the night in it, so he got one of his requirements met.   They did a fund raiser in association with the Walleye Club, and Oldest Son© earned some $ for his individual account for Scouts, to use towards Scouting equipment/camp.  We got up about 5:45am, and started getting into gear.  Things went very smooth, and I was able to leave at 7:30 to get to the house and clean up to get ready to help out at a Cub Scout Day Camp at a local school.  That ran from 8:30 until 3pm. Was a great time!  They had some people dressed up in 1200-1500BC type clothing to reflect King Arthur.  Was a perfect day(little warm tho) for the Day Camp. The kids got a really cool bag, some treats in it to have during the day, a really nice T-Shirt, and an awesome looking patch to wear on their uniform.  It's been a loooooooooong day, and we might still go see Harry Potter 3 tonight, otherwise it's tomorrow to see it.
