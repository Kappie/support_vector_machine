I was quite disappointed to find out my new Motorola A835 won't play back MP3s as a ringtone. But I guess I was asking too much... I will probably settle for some cool sounding drum loop or something. No freaking cheesy melodies on MY phone!  But how cool would it be to have Megadeth's "Train of Consequences" as your ringtone? :P
