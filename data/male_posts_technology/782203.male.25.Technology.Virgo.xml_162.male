Also not sure what I am gonna say if he or Appie asks me for my progress.  I think I am probably gonna start a work-related blog. Then I can like update at the end of every work day ; it will allow me to keep track of what I have been doing and also I can show my superiors what I have been doing on a daily basis.  Hopefully can get it set up by today !
