She will be leaving on August 20th and will be returning on the 17th of September.  The flight, including layovers, is about 16 hours.  Now we just have to work her passport and visa.  I think that she is going to have a great time there and she of course is very excited.  I still don't know what I will be doing over that time, most likely watch a lot of movies.
