One of the most costly short cuts is skipping the development of a sound and highly functional information architecture (IA). While this short cut may take several forms, failure to devote enough resources and to document it properly will cost the owner of the Web site more than just a few cents."

 I don't know how you can even begin to create a usable yet scalable web site navigation paradigm without using even the basics of Information Architecture principles.
