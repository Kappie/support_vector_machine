I have a strange balance of expecting the worst and hoping for the best that has kept me going this far but I don't know how far that is going to get me these days.. It was fine when it was just me but my situation has changed now. I have more to worry about than me.. Also expecting the worst doesn't help a relationship in any way..  So, what do I do? What I always do.. Work at it and as always hope for the best..  Hmmmmm
