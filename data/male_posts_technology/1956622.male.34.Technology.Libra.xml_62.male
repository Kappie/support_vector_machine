However, after working last night I am operating on very little sleep. I truly love Karissa and she is worth every bit of pain I endure for her so the lack of sleep is still worth it. Today I came home and slept about 2 hours before she woke up! Then I took her to the babysitter (a friend that agreed to watch her for a few hours so I can sleep) came home and got about 3 more hours.    Karissa had a great time as the babysitter has small kids and she had a great time playing. When I picked her up I took her to Mcdonald's and got her some ice cream and she played for about an hour.    When we got home Rick's sister Tamara came over with her daughter Madison and they played until about 5 when they both got into the pool. Needless to say Karissa had no problem with daddy leaving for work tonight. She also had no problem with the temp outside being 102!
