     
      I'm a little behind due to a horrendous schedule and a trip out of town. Not too much to report except that I was able to run 12 miles on Saturday through lovely Mayberry.  I would be a lot more excited about it if I hadn't pulled some muscle next to my shin that prevents me from running right now.  I'm back on the reserve list meaning I have to fight woo girls off the ellipticals at the Rec or use the backward machine at Heather and Brad's.  My muscle has been showing signs of improvement with a consistent diet of ibuprofen, but in an attempt to run on it this morning, the pain proved otherwise.
