So, I was really psyched when I read about the  urlLink Internet Book List , a site with a similar concept, but obviously, for books instead of movies. But, after looking around the latter, I am convinced that a site like this isn't really going to succeed until that get at least an initial boost from cooperation by publishers, and least to initially populate the database. While I love "The Hitchhiker's Guide the the Galaxy, I doubt it is the most popular book out there. Great idea though. With some cooperation from the industry, it could be an amazing resource.
