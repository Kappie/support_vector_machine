Not enough kudos to rank up, but I didn't do too badly.  I also aquired a couple of new games, thanks to a friend.  Add  Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy  and  Gladius  to my list.  After racing burnout, I went back to DOA3 Story mode and finished the last five characters.  Yay!  Story finished, and I got the end credits.  I went ahead and unlocked Ein as well, so I guess that's not too bad for a night's work.
