Last night I joined about forty other people at Ransoms Garden Centre to participate in a Firewalk to raise money for  urlLink Breakthrough Breast Cancer . I had been getting people to sponsor me over the last fortnight and come up with just under £100.    The evening started as we laid logs together in pyres and our team leader lit them. We then went back to the restaurant area and had a two hour speech on motivation, mind over matter, etc etc. A lot of it I had already covered, having read books by Tony Robbins etc.    It was hard keeping a straight face when 'Matthew' played Tina Turner's 'Simply the Best' in an effort to get us pumped up. Visions of Ricky Gervais danced in my head. So we all started walking towards the hot coals, being encouraged to clap and cheer to pump ourselves up. I preferred to keep quiet, as did most of my team.    The path of hot embers looked pretty daunting. It reminded me of Terminator 2, when Arnie is being lowered into the vat of molten lead to destroy himself. Matthew went first and strode across, making it look as easy as pie. Slowly we all followed, some people faster than others, but all crossing in about four strides and looking glad to have their feet hosed down at the end.    Then it was my turn. I stood in front of this sea of fire and took a deep breath. Everything seemed to slow down. Then I walked, one foot over the other. I can't really remember much except getting to the end and realising that my feet fucking hurt. I'd just walked across burning hot coals, and I’d burnt my feet. What the fuck did I do that for? I didn't really feel any euphoria or empowered, I felt like I’d done something stupid and now both science and common sense were pissing themselves at my expense.    Eventually we all filtered back for a (rather pathetic) BBQ. Most people had their feet in buckets of ice-cold water and were looking pretty pissed off. A few people in particular had feet covered in blisters and were looking rather ill.    I drove home, countered my blisters, put my feet in a bowl of cold water, knocked back some painkillers and had a beer.    Next morning, I feel rather short changed by the whole event. Especially after finding out seven of us ended up in AE. (Bet the nurses were pissed off, and quiet rightly so.)    I didn't once see a paramedic or St John's Ambulance person there, in case of emergencies, which was pretty poor.     Granted I have very minor burns compared to some, and I’m not really sure why that is. There is plenty of hubbub on the net about ash layers, feet being poor thermal conductors, etc. I don't really know if this makes a difference.     If you walk on hot coals, the chances are you're going to get burnt feet - so sponsor somebody else to do it.
