One who thinks before he speaks, When promises to call, he won't wait weeks. I pray that he is gainfully employed, And when I spend his cash, wont be annoyed. Pulls out my chair and opens my door, Massages my back and begs to do more. Oh! send me a man who will make love to my mind, Knows just what to say, when I ask "How big's my behind?" One who'll make love till my body's a twitchin, In the hall, the loo, the garden and kitchen! I pray that this man will love me no end, And never attempts to sh@g my best friend. And as I kneel and pray by my bed, I look at the w@nker you sent me instead. Amen.  Custards Prayer: Lord I pray for a lady with big t!ts. Amen
