Hotmail  is a Microsoft product! You could use MSN Explorer (v7.0) with Hotmail, but not MSN 8.0. This has to be th stupidest move yet. I was really looking forwarded to trying it out. Aarrrggghhh!!!!

 Update:  I have discovered you can use your Hotmail account, but not as the  primary account . You have to sign up for a MSN account first. Then log in as that new MSN account to MSN 8.0, and add your current hotmail account as a secondary user under Account Manager within MSN. So you can use Hotmail with MSN, but you have to get an MSN e-mail as well. Nobody in customer service seemed to understand this concept. This way I would imagine MSN can say they have "X" many MSN users, not just Hotmail users. Now that I understand this it does make sense, however they need to explain this to customer service and post it clearly on their web page.
