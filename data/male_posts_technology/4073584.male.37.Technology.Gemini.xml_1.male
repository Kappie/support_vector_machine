Hmmmmmm... For some reason I don't remember now, I decided to have a look at it again, but this turn not from  Windows Explorer . Instead, I went there via  DOS  - yes, the old and good  DOS !        Guess what? I found out a bunch of interesting things:    There's a hidden folder, \ gac \ under the main \ Assembly \ folder.    Despite I thought I would find my runtime package there, I didn't, because under the \ Assembly \  urlLink gac  \ folder there is a folder with the same name of the assembly (without the file extension) and, surprisingly enough, one separate subfolder for each version of the assembly!    Once into the final folder - in the case, \ Assembly \  urlLink gac  \ atsSPI3000rp80\3.0.0.0_en-US_89534e58f0857bd2 \ , I could finally reach my goal, the assembly - my compiled runtime package.    More suprises: In this same (leaf) folder, there is a text (INI-like) file named " __AssemblyInfo__.ini ", holding info for the assembly such as:  Signature ,  MVID ,  URL , and  DisplayName .    Here is the contents of the " __AssemblyInfo__.ini " file:       [ AssemblyInfo ]   Signature  = ec86e3af071401b80aaa5f229aea4cd60c5d61e6  MVID  =   1e69ef4352749342b07a26e8d8a9a578    URL  =  file  :  ///G:/D8/WinSys/atsSPI3000rp80.dll   DisplayName  = atsSPI3000rp80 ,  Version =  3.0  .  0.0  ,  Culture = en - US ,  PublicKeyToken =   89534e58f0857bd2                     I didn't try to access the assembly directly to see if Windows complains about, but I'll post any news in this regard just in case.
