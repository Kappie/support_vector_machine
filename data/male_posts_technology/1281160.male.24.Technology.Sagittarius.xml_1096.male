I had been to madurai this past weekend... I too have to take up the exam Kavi is referring to.. though at a later date... But considering a few other things coming my way and considering my limits and priorities.. I'm not one bit confident of taking up this exam in the next 2 months or so... still counting my options... But this is mandatory for everyone in our dept... and I become answerable to my heads in this aspect.. lets see...
