To delude yourself into believing such a thing exists just sets you up as a target for all the people who can't understand why they are so miserable.   No I will NEVER be happy..All I can do is minimize the pain. If I accept the fact that no one wants me to have joy will hopefully make them stop attacking me.  There is nothing left to make life good so I must try to avoid some of the pain.  Life sucks and then you die.  I promise never to be happy now please just leave me alone.
