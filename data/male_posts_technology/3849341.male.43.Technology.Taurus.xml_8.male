Our lack is not a need for anymore slick marketing, self help mumbo-jumbo, or catching the newest fad trumpeted by the latest best selling book. What is it that we lack? Let me apologize for taking a moment to build a case that in fact we are lacking. I always quote this one line from the 12 step recovery program. I consider it a truism and you can apply it concerning most topics. The truism is "the first step to getting help is admitting you have problem". That's not what the church lacks, but it is a precursor to getting the help we need. If we don't realize how utterly shallow, bankrupt, and void of life our faith has become, then we are not yet at a point were we can get help. I have found myself at this point of bankruptcy more than once, I'm sorry to admit. Maybe its just me!? Maybe I'm the anomaly, the exception to the rule, and Christianity is in its finest hour, its glory days. But I would pose one are two probing questions to test the present state of Christianity. Is our lives, internally, and spiritually, at a point were our internal lives spill out freely, overflowing to the people around us. Is there something tangibly different about us that both convicts and draws "THE LOST" at the same time without aid of our PROPS. Hmmmmmm, tell me true. I know I'm found lacking. What about you?What about the church?Maybe its just me, maybe I'm the only one lacking!? Well, onto the solution, what is it we lack? We could list many things, but they are secondary, not foundational. The solution can be known by several names. The Moravians, led by Count Zinzendorf, called it simplicity of devotion to Christ. I steal a term from Song of Solomon, used by Mike Bickle quite often. Lovesickess. We must cultivate a deep sustaining lovesickness for Christ. We settle in scraping the surface in the knowledge of who Christ truly is. There must be more than what we have been mining. In heaven, the Elders and Angels fall prostrate everytime they look a new at this infinitely beautiful God. If we begin to search the depths of Christ, will he let us come up empty? No, I don't believe he will let us stay bankrupt. But we have to give up pursuing the vain, useless things we have given our hearts to(ouch that hurts). In this process of searching the depths of Christ, God will awaken a "LOVESICKNESS" in our hearts. A warning though!! Straight from Song of Solomon 2:7 "Do not stir up nor awaken love until it pleases". Once lovesickness is awaken, you will be ruined, of no earthly good. ;)
