I am honoured to have been bestowed with the great powers of the infinite and my country. I have this great responsibility to lead my men with honour and dignity.  This is the only chance I am left with to prove my love for my country. And I will die happily with my head held high and the enemy bent at its knees.  I bow to thee for bringing me to the dream that I have always dreamed to see. I have my last blood served until my last breath and the last sight I can see. I live to be the solider in the battle field who dreamed to be. I have my heart and my love ready to dream and to make it see.
