SCENARIO A  Boy meets girl. Girl really likes boy. Boy and girl speak for months and become extremely close to one another. Girl pours out all of her emotions to boy. Boy eventually plays her.   SCENARIO B     Another boy meets same girl. Girl really likes boy. Boy and girl speak for months and become extremely close to one another. Girl (thinking about last boy) decides to conceal her emotions. This boy has genuine feelings for girl, however, girls reluctance to show emotion to boy is misunderstood for disinterest. Boy leaves girl.   Question...is the girl more hurt in Scenario A? Scenario B? Or does each scenario hurt equally???   Over the past few years I have been faced with this reoccuring theme. A woman has been scorn in the past and now she feels she cannot let a new man over that emotional wall that she has since built up. Instead she pushes him away not letting him get the chance to meddle with her inner-most feelings. On the inside she may be filled up with emotion, but on the exterior she continues to hold a cold and indifferent demeanor. At this point, a good man will probably try to take into account the things you have gone through, and attempt to ease you into a more comfortable position. But no matter how much time and effort he is willing to put in, you can't help to think about how much it resembles a situation that has gone bad. And eventually, after this man has been there for you time and time again, one day when you least expect it he is gone...possibly forever.  I guess my point with these two scenarios is that the pain that you feel when a situation goes awry is not because of the emotion you show, it is the simple fact that that emotion exists. The only way to avoid feeling the pain is to not have any feelings at all, and its unhuman for that to happen. The fact of the matter is that life is not easy. You are meant to experience pain, because without it we would not know the true meaning of joy. So the next time that somebody makes you happy, cherish them for all they are worth. The possibilites of what may occur are endless.   ~FIN~
