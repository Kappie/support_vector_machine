Really wish to get a perm job but does not reside in IT, at least i can still take IT as a passion or something additional for my personal development.   Mandy's bf had told her that he isn't coming back to Singapore for good. Not something unexpected to me, coz' i had tried to make her face the truth long time ago. Woman.. they preferred to be cheated and then cry over it. Yup, thats plain stupidity.. That, however reflect badly on the guy, which most of the time, might also be a victim in some areas. I wouldn't side Mandy, coz' i know if i merely take her one sided affair of the story, there would be an issue of devil and angel. I fell into such shit before, where i became the devil and the ought to be devil became angel. Woman.. they are so adorable, yet sometimes they can be so scheming.. Alas.  Nothing much to write actually, coz my thoughts are more or less settled for good. 77th Street called me up for an interview this comin Wednesday. Little known is, they are bloody near to my residence! Although the location of the company does not reside in Shenton way, personally, its not bad already.   I really wonder.. when will i be able to crave a niche for myself? I bloody nua for a damn long period of time.. This is so degrading.. So what if i earn more? At the end of the day, its only notes that does not give you much prospect. *Arghh...*  Gotta leave, otherwise might be spending my evening in that bloody office again.  DJ
