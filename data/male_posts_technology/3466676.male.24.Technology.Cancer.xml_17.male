I will admit that I hoped the public would have punished the Liberals for their blatant abuse of our trust and tax dollars a little more, but it was not to be.  At least now with a minority government they will be questioned multiple times by the other parties whenever they try to do something.  Historically minority governments have a tough time accomplishing anything and are quickly dissolved, but this government looks promising.  It looks like they will last around two years or so, barring any drastic events.  For those of you that think your vote doesn't count I would like to point this out to you:  In  urlLink my riding  there were 47615 votes cast and the difference between first and second place was 114 votes.  Since there was only a 65% or so voter turnout, the people sitting at home thinking their vote doesn't count could have changed the results.  If the second place NDP would have won in  urlLink my riding,  they would have had enough MPs to join forces with the Liberals and control parliament with a majority.  Instead, the Liberals and NDP together make up exactly half of parliament and must be careful of a no-confidence vote.  So there it is, each vote can make a difference and I encourage everyone to get informed and vote in all levels of government elections.
