It's a pretty big audit so we will probably be there for the whole week, too bad I don't know anyone over there...  Anyways my supervisor kindly offered me to book me a direct flight from melbourne so it will save me the hassle of flying back to sydney. The best part is my return ticket from melbourne to sydney is fully flexible so I just need to buy a cheap one-way airfare to melbourne for another trip! :)
