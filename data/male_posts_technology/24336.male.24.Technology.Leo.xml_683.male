Someone joked that you don't see Armani suits with "ARMANI" written across the front in huge letters.  Someone followed that up with a desire to see an Armani trucker hat.  Well, I went shopping later that day and what did I see: 

 urlLink    An Armani Exchange trucker hat!  Perfect timing.  I'm starting to enjoy the fact that my phone has a camera now.
