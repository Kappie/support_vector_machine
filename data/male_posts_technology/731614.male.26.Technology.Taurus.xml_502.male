According to  urlLink a news article,  in the Houston Chronicle, textbooks recently approved for use in the state of Texas "are being criticized for being so focused on abstinence that they fail to include state-mandated information on contraception....For example, Holt, Rinehart and Winston's 'Lifetime Health' lists 10 steps for students to protect themselves from sexually transmitted diseases. The use of latex condoms is not one of them. Students are advised, however, to get plenty of rest."  Now, as adults (Jonnie excluded, of course), we are ALL aware of the importance of getting plenty of rest when it comes to preventing STDs. But we know it is so much more than just that. So, as our public service project, I propose that we add to this list of ways to prevent STDs.  I shall start.  1. Get plenty of rest (thanks, Holt, Rinehart and Winston) 2. Avoid using the same knife to cut both poultry and fresh vegetables. 3. Remember to turn your car wheels toward the curb when parking on a hill. 4.
