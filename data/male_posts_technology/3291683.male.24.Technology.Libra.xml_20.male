I mean, these stores are open only because they can't prove these stores are selling pretty much only to the reservation where it's illegal to take beer in?  16 people and 11,000 beer cans per DAY?  Since I'm pretty sure 650 cans per person is a fatal dose in a 24-hour period, I can't help but feel they should shut them all down.  I mean, 50 per person per day is well above sane.  It's blatantly for illegal purposes...  And yet bills to close them down haven't made progress.  I'm sorry.  Maybe I'm just really bitter this morning.  My face hurts.
