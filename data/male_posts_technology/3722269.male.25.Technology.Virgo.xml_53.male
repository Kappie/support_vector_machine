I like to know rough times people plan on arriving, so I can leave things to the last minute, even a commitment like 'before lunch' is great compared to 'maybe friday night, possibly saturday morning, real early' Who knows what 'real early' really means? I sure as hell done. Nevermind. I'll stick by planning, it saves me much stress, and makes my life simple. Y'all like flying by the seat of your pants, fine.. just keep it to yourselves :D
