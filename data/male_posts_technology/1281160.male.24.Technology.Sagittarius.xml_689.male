All his friends are nothing but a cloud of humour, care, smile, laughter, fun, friendliness, love, concern wrapped together to show me the rainbow of life!  Oh my! how i envied and also enjoyed being with them. Appaaaaaa, naan theriyaama savaal vituten, that i will cook for those guys when i am at chennai and they dint leave me till i cooked for all of them though i said  -n-  no. of saaljaapu. Atlast, they made me cook Veg. biryani  Curdrice. Paavam, those guys u know, they had to eat the Biryani which was almost like pongal. Ya i had kept more water and so adhu kolanji pochu. but then taste wise it was good it seems. Curd rice was really superb. In the end, with the threat that i will cook for the next time, every body submitted their results that my cooking was good! Thats Ranjini!! The thing is i cooked for 12 of them at a time. I could not believe that i cooked for so many at a time that too all alone. Ofcourse everybody helped me by cutting vegetables, cleaning rice, opening the grocery packs, cleaning utensils, operating mixie. Ore kalebaram thaan. Kadavule, Water mattum naan correct proportionla vachirundha, today i would have come out with good name  fame ! No probs, i will try sometime later too.   Really it has now given me a confidence that i can cook for -n- no. of people with out any fuss. woweeeeeeeeeee i can manage situations like this in future tooooooooooo.  Hmmmmmmm regarding our visits, we had a great time at Mayajaal, hope u know its a multiplexer and has got bowling alley. U know what, i did bowling for the first time. And the most funny part was, i was the only one who dint know bowling and literally every buddy of his taught me how to bowl. Ya, they were almost praying for me to hit atleast one pin when i was enjoying a full pack strike by them. Good they play u know, including srini. Everytime i bowl, it goes in the side lane and one time u know what happened, as i was swinging the ball front and back, before i could release, it slipped from my fingers and rolled back and almost hit srini. Poor he! then what, every body were flying away from the place, if i was bowling. It was really fun to see a guy hiding behind his friends as i had told that my next target was to hit him.   Ah, atlast, i too could shake some 8 pins in one stroke. Oh, how good they were u know, trying hard to make me hit atlest once. Obviously, had i enjoyed something @ mayajaal then it was due to their friendly move to make me not feel despaired as i couldnt hit and was struggling to hit.   With such an exhibit of concern and fun we left from Mayajaal to Muttukaad to enjoy a classic evening while surfing the backwaters in a rowboat. The whole water was almost bathing in moonlight when we reached muttukaad. Really speaking i was the only one who desparately wanted to go to Muttukad and so coz of me, all the other 12 came with us. Ofcourse worth was our visit, though it was getting dark. Everybody were happy with a new kind of boating experience. U know i struggled hard to row and all others in the boat panicked with the fear that i might drop the oar any time in water. But then they took even this risk for their new guest(its me)!  Then atlast that day i left them free as i was feeling tired and said will go back home.   The next day we started towards Besant nagar beach. The climate was so cool even at 9 o clock and oh my! the beach was clean u know. Not much of Garbage. Good it was to trod on those golden sand and get wet in white waters. All his friends played volleyball and i had a nice time watching them play. Ofcourse we both had a pleasant short walk along the waters to make our morning come live!  In the evening we went for shopping to a Casual wear shop and came out with baggages of shirts and pant for srini. Poor me, i dint buy any as i dint get any of my size and dint like too.  The next day was the day of testing! Yes i tested almost all the members out there with my cooking extravaganza. When everybody were tired we slipped to one of his close friends house to be given a warm welcome to their place. As hari happens to be one of srini's best friend they had a nice time plunging themselves in nostalgia about the heydays they had spent together and also they were discussing on how to bring those days back now! Good move!  With a warm heart we all started our move towards Spencer plaza as i hadnt seen even once. My god, its big man. Hmmmmmmmmmm bigger than all shopping malls in Bangalore. Very spacious were every shops and fully A/ced. Good shopping experience for me. I had a good time, getting into Landmark, one of the biggest book store i believe. We bought a Casette on Madukya Upanishad by Pandit Jasraj. Its a classic! We searched for it in Bangalore, but dint find any and finally caught it at Chennai.  Then we stepped into every garment shop there like Provogue, Blackberys, CP and bought one shirt for Srini at Provogue for Diwali. I liked it. His friends toh, appaaaa, teasing him like anything, coz when ever he enters into trial room, they will ask if i like it or not and when he comes out, he straightly searches for me amidst them and asks my opinion first and then goes to his friends while i was feeling shy to tell my comments infront of them and blushing a bit. Ofcourse, before trying he gets suggestion of Hari, who has got a taste similar to Srini and is more particular in getting the best for srini than me. Nice to see such friends ya!  Finished our shopping spree with a chocolate icecream and mini samosas.  Went home and started packing for our trip to Pondichery. Arey, u should see that East Coast Road from Chn to Pnd, my god, just beautiful and to value add it, the climate became so soothing and cool. So good was the weather and our travel that we never felt the distance covered.  We had a graceful darshan of Mother and Sri Auribindo and got their blessings from their Samadhi. From there we went to the Auroville a city in the making, where people from almost 30 nations are trying to realise the ideals of Mother and Sri Aurobindo. Its fully covered by nature, beautiful was the surrounding and they insist on silence which is really worth in such a divine atmosphere. Oh, it was really surprising to see that almost every soul was dipped in silence when we reached the MAtri Mandir, which is the soul of the city!  With blessings and grace, we left the city and started towards bangalore with a comfort feeling of having spent our days merrily and peacefully.
