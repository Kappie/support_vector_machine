It's sure grown in capability :) Think I'm going to switch from Winamp to QCD - it lacks a media library like Winamp, but I guess I can do without it. It does have a media library plugin, but it doesn't integrate very well - I'd rather see media library support native in QCD - so that skins affect the library window as well.
