They make the tinkering merchants, suppliers and other handy tinks for my city. I personally hate them. They are loud and they break. Yes, they are a good idea and all but what if you just want an ale and some company! I hate drinking ale alone, its depressing. Yet when the families away or busy and I want an ale just try to find a live human being. I told this to my father once and he made me a talking tinker toy. He doesnt have much of a brain and only say 5 things. 'Hi', 'Bye', 'Come back soon','How are you today?' and 'Missed you while you were gone.' Hard to have a conversation of deep thought within those capasities. I tried to program it to be smarter, know a little about nature, gnomes and philosophy. Totally broke but I'm not so sad about it. One time when I was young I told my mother I wanted a pet. Something to love, hold and take care of. I personally wanted a young dire wolf puppy. I thought that if I took care of him just right then he would love me and never grow up to eat me or any other gnome. I thought that after that he could go out into Rivervale and tell all the other dire wolves that gnomes are nice and wonderful and not eat them. My parents didn't agree with this and so my father, mother and siblings all made me a tinker puppy. Who wants a clanky metal puppy when nice warm fluffy ones are right outside thier city?  My mother sat me down one day. I was slightly lit and bashed so gnomes, my city, those blasted toy and the world at large. She was repulsed, she thought that something might be wrong with my head. My father came in on half the bout as well, he thought that I was accursed and perhaps not a gnome at all. They didnt know what to do with me. If I was of an uncivilized race then I probably would have died, however gnomes really are not that violent. My bags were packed the next day and I was off to the nearest School of Brell. I wasnt too pleased as I too was set in my ways of long nights with an ale bottle and mornings that dont exist, yet at least here I could talk to living beings.   There I learned to be cleric of Brell. Fantsy that. Me, Ackron, the gnome voted "One With the Least Potential" was a cleric. I studied hard and found the entire dogma absolutly fasinating. I was entranced. Soon I learned how to call upon the favor of Brell for healing and power. I was also taught that some used this power for evil yet I swore to never do so. I still am young and even cry when I stub my toe. Pain is terrible and I will cure all the pain in Norrath if I must die a thousand times to do so.  Ackron -- Ziggur! Wait for Backup!
