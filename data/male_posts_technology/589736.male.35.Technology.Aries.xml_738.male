I'm training Transportation Security Administration baggage screeners at your nation's airports. That's why I'm here in LA (where, I hesitate to mention, that it's sixty degrees and sunny).  Benjamin -- I can see already that you are right about the blog -- it IS chaotic and more than a little confusing!  Will someone hold my hand?  Ms. Streisand -- Mr. Shipley has nothing but wonderful things to say about you. I look forward to greeting you and your college-aged piece of ass in person.  Yesterday afternoon at LAX, a ceramic plate tested positive for explosives residue and even failed a radiation test. It almost shut down the airport. The bomb dog decided it wasn't a threat and the LEO (Law Enforcement Official) determined that the lady carrying it had a credible story. If any of you are traveling for the holidays, might I suggest shipping your presents separately?  What else do I need to know about this realm?
