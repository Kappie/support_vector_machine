Well I don't know who's scores have been combined with mine for averaging but they must  never  check as I check as often as I possibly can. At least that's what I normally tell the police anyway.  Interesting factette buried away in that article. It seems men are at increasing risk of breast cancer. I suspect this is just a sneaky way we men use to get male cancer research spending increased. I don't know numbers off the top of my head (so I could be talking complete rubbish here) but I remember reading that many more men die of testicular cancer than women die of breast cancer yet breast cancer treatment funding is significantly higher than that of testicular cancer. I blame these wimmin's groups. New Links says 'Equal opportunities for bollocks'!  This place is turning into the fscking  urlLink Lancet . I'm off to find some 8008135.
