If you can't convert binary numbers into decimal in your head (and let's face it who can?) you wouldn't want to rely on this clock as your primary timepiece.  If on the other hand, you can convert binary, imagine how impressed people will be when they see this cool thingey on your desk and see you actually tell accurate time with it. "You are a genius" they will say, "can I be your friend?" they will ask, "I'm walking away now... very slowly" they may whisper.  Link:  ThinkGeek.com
