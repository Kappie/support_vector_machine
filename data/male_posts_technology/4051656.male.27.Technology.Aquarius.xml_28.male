Anyway, the dream was very dark, and centered around a house that was on an island or possibly a peninsula. In the beginning, all my friends and family were there, and we were preparing for an attack from an unknown force. We all had M-16s and were barracading ourselves inside our house. After a while, we started seeing people running around in the surrounding foliage, and I heard some shots being fired from the house and saw a person running away in the woods. Somehow, I had the sense that we had just won a small battle, and I gathered a couple of people to help me storm the boat they came in on. We got to the ship, and it was completely deserted and floating towards the island. Once it got close, it grounded and started to sink. Then I woke up.
