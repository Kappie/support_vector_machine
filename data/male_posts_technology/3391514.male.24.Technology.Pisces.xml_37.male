I found an interesting site today on RPG's -  24Hour RPG .  The premise is simply to generate an entire roleplaying game, system, setting and all, in the space of 24 hours.  I only had a quick look, so I'm not sure if you're supposed to run it immediately afterward... I guess you'd have to, otherwise there'd be no point, would there?  I think I'd like to try that some time.   Fallout 2  is progressing well, but I fear I may have messed up one of the quests big time, which is not good, as its the main quest of the game.  Oops.   UFO  is also going quite well, although those damn Ethereals are annoying me constantly.  And the Snakemen.  Damn them.  Just got actually useful psionics, which is handy.  Haven't tried them out though.  And finally, an apology to anyone reading yesterdays post... I went off on a tangent about "Boobah" and wasn't able to stop... sorry.
