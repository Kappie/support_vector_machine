She had another intestinal episode, it took her a week to clear it up, she came home with a few more meds than when she left.  She plans on going back down to Waterford to continue to help her dad get her mom out of the hospital.  She is getting better, the cast is off, but is not getting up as much as she should. Lyn is going to try to motivate her to get moving.  I, on the other hand, spent last week in Santa Cruz, on business.  I had to go back to continue what I did last time, I might even get another trip.  I didn't want to leave, but Lyn insisted.  I took a disposable camera with me, we'll see how the pics came out.
