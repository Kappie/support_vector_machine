Now, me, I like the brunettes... but when all these blondes look as gorgeous as they do, I really don't mind blondes :-)  So anyway... Moving swiftly along to the not to subtle point of the story.  I'm sitting there, minding my own business... The friend I was with knew her and I asked him to introduce us... He shook his finger at me and said "NO"!  Now, this was not the reaction I was expecting... So I leave it and reckon I'll go over later and introduce myself :-P  10 minutes later, this lovely creature walks over to my bud... and asks him to introduce us... His wife was sitting in front of him, she turned and talked to the blonde as well... and the comment I heard made me weak to my knees! My friends wife said : "If I was 10 years younger, I would also be trying to get into his pants!".Oh my god!   Now don't get me wrong, I love this new found popularity among the female sex. I just hope that whatever I'm doing, I keep doing!!  So now my friend introduces us after she forces him a bit :-P So I get her name, she gets mine, and the first words out of her mouth are: "So you going to go out with me tomorrow night?". "For sure and without a doubt, where we going?" I respond with a smile... "Don't know, meet here, and go from there...".  Now by any standards... that ain't a conversation, thats a please read between the lines because I just want your body!! Like I said before... whatever I'm doing... please let me carry on doing it!!  Anyway, so now I reckon I'm in, and I buy her a couple of drinks...  Alas, I had to much to drink, and as such... buggered off before finalizing a time and place to meet her... and without getting her number... But is ok... the weekend is coming again soon!  BRING ON THE WEEKEND!!! and the blondes ;-)
