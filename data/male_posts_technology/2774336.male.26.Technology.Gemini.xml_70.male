 I must have woken hungry today.  I had a whole banana and half my lunch sandwich by 9:00 am. 

 "I gotta say it was a good day." Today was great! I ate a lot without hardly any trouble.  I even trained tonight.  I was a little dizzy at class, and my body just can't do what it used to. Still, it was worth it.
