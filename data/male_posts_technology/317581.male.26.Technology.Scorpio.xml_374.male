There were 7 people at the movie. 3 girls, 4 boys, can you guess who didn't have a date:)  I don't know, I think I should move out of the boonies. It's hard enough to ask if a girl would like to do something, w/o having to drive 30 minutes to get her. it makes it difficult to be spontaneous.  Also, can I tell you that my girl contact has about reached 0. (Not really true, I saw Jebe and Kelley tonight, but they don't count cause they're here for kevin, I just get the pleasure of their company when Jebe is in town, (also Jebe and Kelley, thanks for hanging out and not dissing me, sorry I couldn't let you drive my car, but I think Amidy would have killed me)) However, back to the original point. I can't remember the last time I met a new girl. Especially, the last time I met a girl and didn't make a total ass out of myself.  2 of My flaws: 1) Not thinking before I speak, and closely related, 2) Speaking whatever's on my mind.  (Usually this involves sex or trying to find out intimate information about the person I'm sitting across from. which in turn makes them embarassed)  Then later I become annoying, and also, I don't pay enough attention to them. (Major flaw on my part, but I have trouble focusing)  The alarm clock comes soon, so I'll be going to bed. God Bless- T
