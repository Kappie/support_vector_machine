I haven't posted for a while so i'm guilty as everyone else. We had a bit night out drinking last weekend and interviewed Damien to see if he's the right kind of stuff we are after. Then we made him drink lots of tequila. hehe.  yeah so.. is it worth me re-launching the site in 2004, or is that the end for the all mighty Toaster Files...  Shout out below with flames/encouragement/suggestions/good curry receipes...
