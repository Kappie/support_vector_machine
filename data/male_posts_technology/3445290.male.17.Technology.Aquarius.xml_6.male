I have always considered myself a very polite person and moderately obedient for a teenager but I think my mother has gone to far in trying to train me into being her pet or robot. It is ridiculous, whenever my father and mother fight I somehow end up with a lot of the flack in the end. Like today when I dropped a bottle of root beer soda my mother freaked out on me because I made noise and she wanted me to say sorry for dropping the pop and reminded me that next time I should say "I am sorry mommy, I dropped the rootbeer and I wont do it again" (other days she requires me to say things like "I am leaving for school mommy I love you very much" which is a bit excessive if you have to force people to say they love you). Other things she tells me is that I should quit going to the gym 4 days a week and that I should quit my job because i dont make enough money compared to her but I CAN ONLY WORK A PART TIME JOB DUE TO SCHOOL!! She just does not have any understanding of western ways and always says crazy Canada this and Crazy canada that!. I mean this usually happens to me on a regular basis where I am either the scapegoat or the dog they kick when I piss them off in a small way but I will not put up with it when I just got back from a work shift and I am also tired from working out for 2 hours(Usually I am quite immune to this type of treatment since I have grown up with it). Its really quite a stupid how my mother continually bothers me and trys to blackmail me or decide not to give me money when I need it for basic needs then ask me the next day casually if I am going to take care of her really well when she is older and buy her a nice big house(I always tell her what she wants to hear but too bad she does not understand the concept of karma or heard the song "cats in the cradle").     I think it is unfair to force your children to pay the consequences of your misfortunate emotional relationship with your spouse because it just piles on to the emotional pile of crap that kid takes on a daily basis from school, work, home, friends, relationships, self esteem, and extracurricular activities. Its nowonder so many kids decide to run away from home or commit suicide or turn to other types of drastic measures (and I can name tons of incidences which are a direct result of this type of treatment).     **anyways this was good for me, it was kind of like talking to a counselor because I was able to get a bunch of stuff of my back that was bothering me. I really am a quite and polite person and keep things to myself usually but everyone has their limits and they are just ticking timebombs ready to explode on the next little peeve or annoyance that bothers them. This is one pissed off brophy saying L8R!**
