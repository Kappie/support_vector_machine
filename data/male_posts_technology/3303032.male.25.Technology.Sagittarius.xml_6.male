Commodus' whining little punk ass gets what he deserves.  He stabs Maximus in the back, cheats and slugs his way through the fight, only to find himself helpless as Maximus shoves the dagger into his throat.  Maximus then falls to the ground, and slips off into Elysium to be with his family.  The movie ends with Juba burying Maximus' idols of his wife and son, with the line "Now we are free.  I will see you again, but not yet.  Not yet."    Fucking awesome.    4>  As Good as it Gets.  Anyone who knows me knows that I have a little bit of Melvin Udall in me (or maybe a lot).  So it's good to see him at the end come around, and have other people understand him.  The line "...and the fact that I get it, makes me feel good!" is perfect.  I'll always want to get warm rolls after seeing that movie.  3>  Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.  Jimmy Stewart.  Any movie with Jimmy in it is worth watching.  ANY.  The line, not quite at the end of the movie, but the defining moment of the movie:  "No I will NOT yield the floor!"  No other man, not Heston or Brando or Connery could pull that off.  Here's a simple man who will not falter in his resolve.    2>  The Godfather.  Michael Corleone, as he's watching the baptism of his nephew, has the heads of the five families in the NY crime syndicate systematically murdered.  Easily one of the best directed scenes in cinema history.  The lesson here:  Don't fuck with little Mikey.  1>  Rocky.  I don't care who you are, if you don't shed a tear at the end of Rocky you're not a man.  Seeing Rocky, at the end of the 15th round trying desperately to get to his feet, and Adrian in the entryway, it just kills me.  Here's the only guy who's ever given a shit about this woman, and he's doing everything he can to stand up.  It fucking slays me every time.
