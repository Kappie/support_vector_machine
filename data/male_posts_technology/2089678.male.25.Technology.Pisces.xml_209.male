We got   urlLink complaints   saying US $20 has been charged for this product as shipping and handling cost.   Guys, there is something wrong at paypal. I was creating buttons for another offering from Xyling Technologies and to my strange discovery, that US $20 is charged to those opting for JACK. The donate button on my site had been left unchanged since the time it has been launched. Many developers have previously paid clicking the same button. I am not sure why this happened (right now suspecting PayPal bug).  Please treat this as a sincere apology and request to try again making your payment. Make sure you do not pay anything more than US $5(for a copy without free minor updates and user manual option), in case the shipping charges are apprearing again, click on the title of this blog post to pay directly.   Please note that the software would be available as a download and there will not be shipping of any type of media.    Sorry again for the inconvinience.  Best Regards, Team @ Xyling.com   urlLink JACK Home Page   urlLink JACK - Donate Now!
