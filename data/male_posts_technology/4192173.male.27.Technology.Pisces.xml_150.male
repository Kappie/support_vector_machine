HOWEVER - me being the winner that i am, my suitcase has already been checked onto the next flight down which arrives at 5pm local time (it's 1115am now) which means that since my baggage is more than three hours late and i bought my plane tickets thru AMEX, i get some sort of make-good in the form of $$$ :) happy, but to say that i can't wait to kick it former-eastern-bloc-turned-genocidal-dictatorship tomorrow in croatia is an understatement. fuck the eu.   i've been up for a full 24hours now, so as soon as my hotel room is ready i aim to sleep.   i wish my friends well and i'll check in with updates of uncharted lands soon.  NOTE TO FRANK: since you're into taking advice from the 5yo, what are his thoughts on REVENGE OF THE GAY?
