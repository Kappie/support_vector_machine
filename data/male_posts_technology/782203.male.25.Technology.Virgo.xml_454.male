But ONLY if I know you , otherwise don't do anything ( unless your life is so sad that you need to get a virtual birthday e-card from someone you don't even know) .  Once you have entered it, I will then be reminded of your birthday 2 days before the date. Whether I do anything about it is another matter. Depends on a lot of factors like whether you are a guy or gal, whether you are single, whether you are hot etc. etc.... nah just kidding . You can still be hot on the inside.   BTW thanks to that gal who send me that e-card on my birthday when I was all alone at home last year. I think Im falling in love with you , whoever you are.
