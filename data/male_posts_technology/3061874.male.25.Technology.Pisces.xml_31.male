Suddenly, instead of publishing via email, content providers can cause an MSN Alert to appear on your screen. This - of course - is only opt-in - so you (the user) have complete control (and LiveMessage is completely CAN-SPAM compliant).  "Why should the RSS world care" you ask? MessageCast is in beta on their  urlLink MessageCast Syndication Edition  for RSS publishers. To try it - if you are an MSN Messenger user - simply click on my LiveMessage link right here or on the top right side of my blog under Syndicate Me.  Now - MessageCast won't be a replacement for your RSS reader (hopefully it's NewsGator or NGOS Web / Mobile / POP / Media Center Edition). Instead, you'll use MessageCast for your urgent feeds - the one's you want to know about the minute they are posted. MessageCast is provided to the publisher as a service - no software is required and it takes less then five minutes to configure for an RSS feed.   Message Cast is partially funded by Mobius Venture Capital. Message Cast platform enables one to recieve RSS content on IM's , via email and via mobile phones.
