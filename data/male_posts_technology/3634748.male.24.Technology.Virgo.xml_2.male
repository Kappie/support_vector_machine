Nintendo has a new device coming out this year, temporarily named the  urlLink Nintendo DS .  Think of a game boy on steroids, with two screens, touch-sensitivity (stylus, finger, whatever) built-in mic, wireless and internet communications, and better-than-n64 graphics.  It's not even the fancy technical stuff that's got me excited about it, but the new possibilities a touch-screen, a mic and wireless connections mean for gaming.  One of the tech demos shown at this year's E3 had the player draw Pac-Man, big, small, with fangs, whatever, which would then spring to life exactly as drawn and go about its ghost-munching business.  The player then has to draw in walls to turn and guide it around.  If there's a Zelda title that involves some clever use of the touch-screen, or a portable, modern Mario Paint that takes advantage of all this funky new input (and why not upload animations wirelessly to the web, while we're at it?) I'll be just as hooked on this damn thing as I have been by Nintendo's other gadgets over the years.  Backwards-compatible with all past Game Boy stuff too, can't beat that!  To be fair I should mention that Sony's introducing the  urlLink PSP  sometime too, this year or next.  Not surprisingly, it's more of a straight evolution of the Game Boy concept without any funky new ideas.  Think SNES->PlayStation, GBA->PSP.  Dreamcast-ish graphics on a big, pretty screen, battery-sucking new minidisc format, Sony shape-buttons.  Not that carrying a self-contained PS2 around in one's pocket doesn't have a certain appeal, I just get more giddy about new ideas than I do about "now with bigger numbers!" type stuff.  Drifting a bit... It used to be a person didn't learn about the next big thing in video games practically until it happened.  We'd rent/buy stuff after looking at the screenshots on the back of the box.  I like that the internet makes any information a person's interested in so immediate, but there was something kind of nice living in the present instead of the future, too.  Eh.  *shrug*
