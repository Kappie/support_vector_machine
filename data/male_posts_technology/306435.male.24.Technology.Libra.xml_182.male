I have picked up the ability to make a mean pot sticker.  I first tried making the tasty treat after purchasing a package from the freezer section at Kroger.  They seemed simple and overpriced...I was right.  I quickly downloaded a recipe off the web and went at it.  The hardest part was finding all the ingredients.  Tonight will be my first mass cooking attempt.  Cross your fingers!  I will keep you updated with my  urlLink MoBlog !
