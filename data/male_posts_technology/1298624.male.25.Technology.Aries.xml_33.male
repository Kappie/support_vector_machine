I guess a bit of a preface is in order. I woke up one morning to a certain grinding noise in my jaw. Of course, being myself, I didn't think anything about it because, at 24, who does?! We're invincible right?! WRONG!  TMJ Syndrome (I think it's Temporal Mandibular Joint syndrome) is what I have. It starts when you do something to your jaw (be it exercising or some other activity) that pushes the cartilage disc out of alignment with your jaw. So then when you move your jaw, you hear a grinding noise (which I learned is your jaw bone riding against the joint in your skull). To make matters even worse, there is a nerve that runs along that joint where the jaw can run over and cause extreme amounts of pain. This was my state of being last friday.   I think pain is defined by different levels. Suffice it to say, I have never experienced this level of pain before. I know all pain is annoying, but this pain was just more than that. I couldn't eat...at all! How annoying is that?! EVERYBODY needs to eat! Why can't I?! Whenever I tried to attempt to open my mouth last friday, I was delighted to experience pain on a level that reached supreme annoyance akin to being jabbed in the jaw with a syringe 20 times. Oh Oh Oh! Not only that! Ohhhh nooooooo! I had to wake up at 3:00 am in the MORNING on friday to take my father to the airport. So not only was I orally retarded, but I was fazed beyond belief due to lack of sleep. My LAN party (which was after hanging out with Liz-Ann) lasts from 6 pm to 3 am in the morning, effectively pushing myself beyond 24 hours.   Admittedly, it is a very stupid thing to do, but hey, I've never done it before (and even under the 600 milligrams of Motrin, which helped tremendously). I could not eat ANYTHING hard. I felt like an old man chewing on a stick of grass like a cow. It is amazing to think how severely incapacitated I was just because of the right side of my jaw. Albeit a very  important  part of my mouth, but still...you'd think it would last without any problem till I'm 65 or something!  ...and the fact that it happens to more women than it does for men does not bode well for my male ego (not that I've ever had one anyway).
