Such a condition makes our mind so poor in understanding, inferring, and stating, that we are beings now without the force of real thought and feeling directing us. Usually our present state is that we are in an emotional mess. Emotions and sentiments of a cheap sort are our prop. Noisy verbal expression of musty ideals and appealing exhortations is the limit of our mental power. If we imagine that we are right, and that those whom we admire are 'really' great, we are well contented. If you look carefully at our writing, you will not fail to see that we scarcely realize that  we have a mind whose function is to think.    It has not been possible for us, since the inception of modern education to master a text and comment intelligently on it. This condition leads us to dependence upon Western resource, of intelligent application of mind. It means subordination, as long as we do not acquire any ability to keep ourselves independent. Suppose we attempt now to do some writing independently without this ability, we produce hogwash only.  It has this effect, namely, that we see clearly the superiority of the Western mind, but there is no stimulus to improve our mind just because mental improvement does not strike us as worthwhile beside planning and acting for bourgeois success . Let us be quite clear that there cannot be mental improvement without concentration on language and its classics
