You may say, that Software should be a Science as viewed by Stallman  co [ I included (at times)], but  urlLink Donald Knuth  himself says that it is very difficult to keep in pace with the scientific aspects of a field which is economically very  rewarding.   The Art of Computer Programming bear the quotes of Bill Gates.( 2 times I have noticed thus far glancing through 10 pages).  A very old  urlLink article . But still very interesting.
