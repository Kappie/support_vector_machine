Life did not begin where we found it so its that much less logical to believe that one can always change the world to our liking. Such reasoning defines why a mans home is his castle...its the only realm where change moves at his speed. Where the inherent denizens skip melodically to the beat of his authoritative drum. Life did not begin for me 10,000 feet off the ground, but to such a place have I been lifted. To have flown so high and to now experience undetermined turbulence...  I've always considered my life  future to be a symbol of purpose from the divine. Too much knowledge and too much intuition to merely sit still, stay black and wait for death. I asked God for wisdom, asked him for purpose. Asked him for a sound mind, and asked that he would meet me halfway on everything. In time I started climbing that ethereal ladder of progress and my wings began to grow  sprout proudly from my evolved form. Some would say that I am the model of human progress, that I have lived the ideal existence, given the circumstances before me. But at the end of the day i'm just not as complete as I planned. Seemed like a drawback at first until I realized...God is in control. I've tried it my way and I failed. Now i'm certain that its my duty to follow the Lord's lead. So fly I have, even with the turbulence. You can look left, you can look right. You can even look up above but never ever look down.
