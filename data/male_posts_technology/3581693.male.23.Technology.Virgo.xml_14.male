I worked a lot and of course school - so sufficed to say when I got drunk it happened very fast - and the animal in me came to life.  So there we were - the guys out for a night of drinking downtown. There may have been 1 girl with us... maybe two...  Anyways I'm nice an' wasted - this time in my head I became a super athlete.   I ran off ahead of the group - and jumped over some bushes and hid behind them.  Then some loud mouth punks start yellin' out of the window of a cab at me - "HEEEY MAN!!"  I stand up - ready to fight ( Note: I've never been in a fight in my life ) - "You want some?!?! HUH? HUH?"  "No man - not at all - you're tree guy - we won't mess with tree guy"  Alright so now we're cool - and I'm tree guy... so I take of like a rocket - must have been going mach 40 up robson.  I could hear the ladies on the street saying "ooooooh - aaaaaaah - look at tree guy go - oh I want Tree Guy"  Well, honestly I can't remember whether it was the ladies or if it was the guys yelling at me "Hey tree guy - where you going?!?!"  Either way - tree guy was born that hot summer night in downtown Vancouver.
