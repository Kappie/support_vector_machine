They got to spend some quality time at the beach and got in some good snorkeling.  Me and my folks hiked Diamond head and another hike called the Makiki Tantulus hike, which we managed to get lost and rained on, but, it was still a very nice hike.  One day we all went to Lilikani beach by Kailua beach where I went windsurfing on the Windward (east) side of the island.  It's a great beach, crystal blue water, powdery sand, and little islands out in the water, makes it look a bit like a Carribean post card.  We ate at some nice restaurants, Dukes, Roys, some good Sushi places.  Got to see the new movie with Jack Nicholas and Diane Keaton, and Keanu Reeves, also got to see Last Samurai and Lord of the Rings 3, all of which I thought were great.  Hit up New Years and heard some group play some Beatles songs and also got to see the fireworks on Waikiki.  It was a great time, I was sad to see them go, made me miss Texas a little bit.  But I'd rather be laying on the beach here than the street of 1960.
