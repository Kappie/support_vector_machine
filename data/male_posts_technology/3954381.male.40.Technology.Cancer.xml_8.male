With a book by John Weidman, Music and Lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, Directed by Joe Mantello, Starring Becky Ann Baker (Sara Jane Moore), James Barbour (Leon Czolgosz), Mario Cantone (Samuel Byck), Tony Winner Michael Cerveris (John Wilkes Booth), Mary Catherine Garrison (Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme), Alexander Gemignani(John Hinckley), Neil Patrick Harris (Balladeer/Lee Harvey Oswald), John Schiappa (Proprietor), Jeffrey Kuhn(Giuseppe Zangara) and Denis O'Hare (Charles Guiteau).    The closing was announced afew weeks ago as attendance has been down and they had not been playing to capacity.Luckily I had secured tickets to the show just prior to this annoucement for today's matinee. I have seen my shareshows both on Broadway and off;granted my taste is, I think, what you would call eclectic. I've seen Gypsy (with Bernadette Peters), Urinetown, Wicked, The Guys (with Susan Sarandon), The Mercy Seat (with Liev Schreiber and Sigourney Weaver), The Rocky Horror Show, Woody Allen's Writer's Block, Sweeney Todd (1989 revival), and the infamous expensive Broadway flop Carrieto name a few....but I have to say I think Assassins is the best show I have ever seen.    From the moment the show started to the finale I was completly mesmorized and under the spell of the entire cast and production team. Essentially a review chronicling, in a carnival-like atmosphere, 9 American political assassins and would be assassins, the show is steeped with very dark humor and boasts a beautiful and melodic score that could only have come from legendary Broadway composer Stephen Sondheim; a man I have been fascinated by, attracted to, and in total awe of.    Every aspect of this show, from the production design, lighting, musicians, was flawless.All ten performers listedabove were superlative. Simply put, I have never been so filledwith glee, joy and pure contentment during a theatrical performance.   In June of this year this show won 5 Tony Awards, Best Revival, Best Director (Joe Mantello), Best Featured Actor in a Musical (Michael Cervaris), Best Lighting (Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer)and Best Orchestrations (Michael Starobin)....so you may be asking, if this show is so good and it won all these awards...why is it closing?Well as I previously statedit just wasn't playing to capacity and couldn'tcontinue. I can't imagine a more depressing scenario; I suppose people just want to attend glossy, slick, happy sappy (and crappy) shows like Forty Second Street, Aida, and Beauty and the Beast (don't even get me started on the putrid Disney-fication of Broadway in recent years), to name just three long runningshows still playing. I know, I know, it's all a matter of personal taste and I'm not arguing that point. Art is subjective. But consider this, we can't subsist on a diet of all candy (granted it's taken me many years to realize this), shouldn't we vary ourentertainment as we vary our diet? Doesn't it make us a more complete healthy person? Shouldn't we treat our minds as well as our bodies?    A thought provoking intelligent show like Assassins probably never had a chance. I just find it so depressing to know I live in a world where IQ's are droppingat an alarmingly accelerated rate. Good times. Good times indeed.
