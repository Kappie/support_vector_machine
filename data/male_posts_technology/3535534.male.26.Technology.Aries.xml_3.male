I am really excited and looking forward to doing this but at the same time it is going to be a huge change for me.  Except for the short time spent in Dallas and South Africa I have spent my entire life in this area.  As much as people knock Waco it is not a bad city.  It is small and not over crowded, heck rush hour traffic consist of a 5 minute wait at Waco Dr. and Franklin.  But San Antonio is a good place and I guess sink or swim here I come.  The car is going great but will be put on hold until after the wedding die to time and room problems.  I hope to update this a little more regularly, but that is just a Patrickâ€™s Life.
