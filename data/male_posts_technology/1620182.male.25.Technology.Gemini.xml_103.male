We froze a bit as we processed who exactly was staring back at us.  "Come on in, guys."  He was quite friendly.  We introduced ourselves and told him where we work.  That was about all we could get in before we got to the first floor.  All in all, a pretty awkward situation.  I'll have to prepare some questions in case I run into him again.  I have to work on being prepared for this sort of thing...
