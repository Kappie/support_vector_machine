I do believe this finding knocks down the final excuse to invade Iraq.  OK, correction, the one excuse that held up was "Saddam is an asshole and must be knocked from power" (of course, you can use that excuse for any number of countries in the world).  Of course, this report may be somewhat flawed, but all indications show that Hussein and Bin Laden weren't the chummy buddies the Bush Administration led everyone to believe.  Generally, I must admit that I like George Bush.  He seems to be doing what he feels is right in his heart, and I gotta give him credit for that.  His administration, though, I just can't stomach, and because of that, he simply ain't getting my vote.  Yes, this makes me a "Kerry" supporter, but only because there's no other real option.    I sincerely hope there comes a day in my life where I can stop voting "for the lesser evil" and have the ability to vote for someone I actually believe in.
