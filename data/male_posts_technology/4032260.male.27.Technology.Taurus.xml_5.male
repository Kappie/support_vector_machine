I decided to check up on my parents in Ft. Lauderdale over the weekend. :) So this is from the pastor who spoke at my parent's church)  The message was about being in the 'wilderness'.  He spoke about how the Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness before He began His ministry and how Jesus often went out to the wilderness ('solitary place') to pray.  Two of the main points that he made were these: 1.) God often brings you to the wilderness to get your attention and 2.) Don't leave the wilderness until you have a sense of purpose.  That struck me because oftentimes I feel as if coming to Florida was God sending me into the wilderness.  In the past I've compared it to be like God sending Moses to Midian for 40 years.  So my question is: God why did you send me here?  (What is my purpose?)  In praying this question to God he brought a passage of Scripture to mind: Romans 12:1-2 which says: "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.  And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God."  Do you see God's answer to my question?  Well... God's response to my question?  If you want to know the will of God, you will not be conformed to this world.  In fact you will let yourself be transformed by the renewing of your mind.  The Holy Spirit is right now renewing my mind.  However I need to make a decision to allow that change of mind to change my walk... and when my walk is changed... I will not be conformed to the world's standards.  But God went on... the next passage that came to mind was 1 Corinthians 13: 1-3 "Though I...     speak with the tongues of men and of angels...     have the gift of prophecy...     understand all mysteries and all knowledge...     have all faith, so that I could remove mountains...     bestow all my goods to feed the poor...     give my body to be burned...     but have not love, it profits me nothing."  What good does it do to have a changed life but have not love?  God doesn't care about that... He is not a 'kill-joy' God who wants me to be miserable.  He wants to set me free so that I can love.  But what is love?  Verses 4-7: "Love...     suffers long...     is kind...     does not envy...     does not parade itself...     is not puffed up...     does not behave rudely...     does not seek its own...     is not provoked...     thinks no evil...     does not rejoice in iniquity...     rejoices in the truth...     bears all things...     believes all things...     hopes all things...     endures all things."  Pray that this will impact me.  Pray that I will let myself be transformed by the renewing of my mind.
