I was also impressed with the little things on the way, such as the beautiful scene of trees and mountains. It was a nice drive, long but nice.  After we left St. Louis this morning we stopped again in Springville (mid-way point) and found a 'An American Pizza Place', I think. It was a happening place, we ate the buffet and played the games. It made a nice break from the drive and then we pushed on. So now its 11 p.m. here and by the Grace of God no wrecks, accidents, suicide bombers, ect.
