He's retired now, having made a boatload of money, and spends his time living leisurely.  He has a most excellent web space set up and it's unusual in that it's more infomative than flashy.  You can see the  urlLink home page here .  He's got just boatloads of cool content there.  He's really into astronomy and put together an amazing guide on weight loss.  He also has a reading list  urlLink here .  The purpose of this post is to focus on this section.    This man reads  a lot .  I went through his list and added six or seven books to my  urlLink Amazon Wish List .  (Feel free to buy me something from it.  :)  If you do, and you go there from John's reading list, he'll get a little bonus money.  Spread the wealth if you can.  Anyway I thought this would be a good place to list books that I'm reading.  I certainly won't have the quantity of John's list; he has seven listed for January and it isn't even the end of the month!  I likely won't have the quality, either, since I still have childish and purulent interests aside from my intellectual and scholarly ones.  Daddy always said to keep your interests broad!  :)  I just checked out Stephen Ambrose's  urlLink Nothing Like it in the World  from the library.  I'm a huge Ambrose fan and definately looking forward to reading it.  It's the story of the building of the transcontinental railroad as told in Ambrose fashion.
