A lady from *** called me regarding the job at *** and asked me to come down to their office at Raffles Towers tommorow so that they can give me the offer letter with the contract details and stuff. I have been jobless for like 9 months liao and it was really getting to a point where it was really embarassing to mention to people so can imagine how glad i was when they called me. Well still not sure how the pay is gonna be like but hopefully its reasonable , but i'm just excited about working in such a big company like *** so let's see what happens tommorow !
