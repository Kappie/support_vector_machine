Top o' the mornin' to ya [2x] (Hey, are you givin' us a hassle man?)  Greetin's, salutations Peace to the nations of Zulu and Islam Crack the bottle, rev the throttle Put the gear in, now you're stearin' Like Mario Antretti So let me kick it, cause I can make a wicked Noise like a cricket Rubbin' his legs, my rhymes are like eggs I'll keep layin' 'em, I'll keep sayin' 'em This is the House Of Pain, we're far from plain But we're not fancy, Ron and Nancy So just say no, but I say go Straight to hell, I kiss and tell So if you're a ho, all my friends know What you gotta say, let's hit the hay And have no delay, and yo, by the way Top o' the mornin' to ya
