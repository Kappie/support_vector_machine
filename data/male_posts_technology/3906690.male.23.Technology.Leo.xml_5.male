I'll be taking three classes over a period of two semesters, three classes...Then I'm done. I will have completed all requirements for a Bachelors degree in Computer Science Information Systems, with a minor in Sociology. The thing that sucks is the structure of courses at the college. For example a course being offered one semester throughout the entire school year...or a course offered a semester every other school year...an odd/even year type of deal. This has screwed up my original graduation date. I was actually supposed to have been done in May of last year. But since I took a year and a half off of school to work in the oil field, that date was pushed back another year and a half. So I was supposed to be done completely this December. I ran into...hell, I don't know what I ran into...but it's these damn courses with the odd/even year deal. So one of the three required courses I need will be taken during the winter semester of 2005. Which is all right I guess...A kick back semester.  This wasn't what I intended to write...The reason why I've been thinking is because...Since this is my last year of school, I was hoping to concentrate on these last two semesters. For the past two semesters I've been taking upper division CSIS courses...and hell they aren't as easy as they seem. Honestly, my schooling has been like shit these past two semesters. I have dropped out of the Dean's list. Each upper CSIS courses taken these last two semesters I have passed with C's and one B. I'm thinking if I really focus on these remaining three courses and pass them with A's, I could get back on the Dean's list. I'm not sure how this will go, time will tell. I'm the one to blame for this...downfall, or whatever it might be called. *L* I just can't believe I actually passed those classes without even opening the required text books. If I were to have read from the text books, then the outcome would have been a lot different. I guess I can't really rely on my...what I have learned long ago and still remember method. I don't know, this method worked wonders for me in the Mathematics field...hmm, I'm 20 credits away from completing requirements for a degree in mathematics, I wonder...I better not.  Hmm, sidetracked again. Anyhow, I need to focus on these remaining two semesters...I've been thinking if I should ask a certain person if we could take time off...I have my mind set on school, then again with what's going on within in my family, and other stuff I can't get my mind off of at this point. My mind at this point is cluttered with a lot of stuff. I'm not sure how to go about this...questions will arise...answers. I mean if that person understands I'm guessing it would be ok...then after I'm done with school, after things settle within my family, and others work out, we could do away with the time off. I'm just worried I might lose this person...which I don't want to happen. Damn, all this stuff, it's enough to break a person down. I'm just trying to stay focused and on track of my surroundings on a daily basis, "one day at a time." I've broke down before and it sucks@ss...barely made it out of that hole...not completely, but still living to this day. I just don't want to bring this person into what's going on in my life up to this point. I've been hiding my "blah" thus far, it can't go on like this...I don't know, maybe I shouldn't say anything.  Well this past weekend I had the option of spending time with family. Family from my dad's side invited me to go camping in telluride. A birthday outing for my cousin, "Jhah." "Maybe" was my answer. I didn't go. Saturday evening was my other cousin’s birthday on my mom's side. Again "maybe" was my answer. Again I didn't go. It seems lately I've been staying away from family. Well after what happened, this started. Sometime between then and now I did mention that I would in fact keep away from family for a while, just to be alone, and think. I'm not sure how long I'm going to do this. Not much longer I'm sure. The only person I associate with now is my little brother. We talk, laugh, play guitar/bass, and make up all sorts of stuff, musically. I'm happy to be spending time with him. So instead of going to these happenings, I stayed home...chilled with my little brother. We drove around, here and there, watched kung fu movies (corrected mistakes in the actors' form :P), took turns caring for the livestock...basically that's it. A kick back weekend.  July...three or four more birthdays this month (within my family), including mine :P. I'll be 23 at the end of the month, on the 31st. I probably won't do anything...Another day of the year, another year to my life. Yea...Dang, 23...K'ad daats'i Hastiin salii *L* :P   Here's a lil something...  *Tired and Alone*  Take a good look  I know what you see  shot in the back  left behind  livin through the day  dead and buried is the joy I once found  as I walk this world tired and alone  got one foot in the grave  no time to rest  refuse to bleed  no end in sight  the loss of hope  the loss of friends  nothings going to change  the more they do  the more they're the same  forever wanting more  starting all over again  now that ive seen  what has come and past  forget all that is pure  it never lasts  one can't deny  kill your past and all that you knew  in the end we find whats true  take your time  sooner or later you'll find your place  Copyright © 2004 SJohnson
