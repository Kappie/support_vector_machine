       Headache 

       Gurgling 

    

     

 

 

 Well my stomach is doing well today.  I've been consistently eating small amounts of the pasta salad throughout the day.  Usually there are one or two solid belching sessions a few minutes after eating but that's all. 

 I had two pieces of twizzler licorice and within 10 minutes my intestines were gurgling.  I would be surprised if the two were related - that seems a little two fast for an intestinal reaction - but who knows. 

 Overall so far today: low belching, no gurgling except a little after licorice, and a major head ache.
