I thought yesterday lunch was quite funny with yet another fight which consisted of Bradley v me, Eddie and Colette. It was funny mainly becauise their argument consists of 'fuck off'. Nice. I had the best lunch today. I spent the whole hour cuddling Paul and it was so nice. :)  Jackie has new shoes!!!!!
