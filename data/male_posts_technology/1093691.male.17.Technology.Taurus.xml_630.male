Jo - wopee! have fun with your clainet, perhaps you and paul will try and act out THAT scene in American Pie 2.....or is it American Pie 1? Hmm. LOL. Max - yes I think my cats are funny. But not when Hattie decides to be sick all over the white rug. Yuk. Your cats are sweet, what are they called? How sweet.
