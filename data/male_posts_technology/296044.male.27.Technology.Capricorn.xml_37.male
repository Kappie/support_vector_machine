I was just reading an article in  urlLink Slate magazine  online (a great liberal dispatch on the craziness of this modern world, I recommend you read) about how the  urlLink National Enquirer  is actually completely fact based; albeit obnoxious about what it considers to be news when I saw a link to another, far less trustworthy  urlLink tabloid , claiming that indeed the Pontiff had been struck by a space rock. God forbid.                But I digress. Today is technically the first day I can begin moving in to my new apartment. I receive the golden keys at 5 pm today. Well, OK, theyre not golden, but can you tell this day is like money to me?  urlLink (Youre so money!)  Im obsessed with my move in! I guess Im just so excited to have a place I can call my own, where I can call all the shots, where no one else is invited unless I say so, where I can have silence when I please, no dog hair everywhere, nice new furniture, and loads of other fun-loving bachelor plans. And, Im back downtown, in the  urlLink heart of it all !                So wish me luck this week as I begin my moving adventure. And please, pray to the furniture gods that my  urlLink new couch and loveseat  fit through my front door                Cheers.
