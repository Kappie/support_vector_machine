To my darling JaQ...bloggies are FOR ranting, raving, and otherwise pillaging (does that make sense??) the internet. Sooo you don't get to feel sorry for posting it, cause we care!!! I hope you got big dollah amounts for that...nine changed to one....good thing you're flexible. *sighs* NO FEELING SORRY! NO NO NO!!!! BLOGGIES ARE GOOD FOR YOU!! GOOD FOR US!!! NOW STOPPIT!!!! In the nicest way possible. Of course. :D  Second off! Yes, I AM dead, and yes, I did go to the test, but NO I did not survive. And it wasn't my back either.  I am the new and improved GIMP O TRON!!!! SIMPLY PUSH MY LEG AND ILL SCREAM IN SEVEN DIFFERENT TONES OF PAIN!!!!! ONLY 19.99  1/2  FOR TWO DAYS!!! GET IT NOW WHILE YOU STILL CAN!!!! *rolls eyes and snorts*  BUT IN A HAPPIER TONE!!!! Teh JaQ is awesome. Teh JaQ is good.
