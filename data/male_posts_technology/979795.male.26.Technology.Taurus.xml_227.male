Time will tell if we can remain good friends as we were before we got together. Anyway ... like one of my housemate mentioned, this period is really one of the worst possible time possible for us to put our relationship to the test. Everyone's so busy and all ...  Thanks hor, brother Shuhua, for your comments on my blog. I think I managed to read all of them unless you left some on the blogs which dated about 3 months back. Yea, well I didn't really tell anyone about my girlfriend (ex now) when I was in Singapore. Probably only the 3-4 of my NS kakis and Gary and Marcus/Ivy. Gary knew because we see each other often enough during Aikido, plus I always drop by his place regularly. Marcus because I had mentioned to them before the last time we met before he went to Sweden. Yea, my blog does look like a training manual of sorts. It basically documents what I'm going through daily. As Aikido is a huge part of my life now, it's not surprising that most chunks of it are Aikido related contents, an Aiki-diary if you will. Anyway my VRML project is very slow and status is quite bad now. I'm gonna be skipping Aikido to make up for lots of lost time. May need to spend a lot more hours in school from this Mon onwards. Ai pia jia eh yia! Anyway, own time own target just feel free to drop by and check me out. Leave me a message on ICQ too if you like. But sometimes I maybe asleep or in school. Might have left my laptop running to download some stuff.   urlLink Una-san  (??),  urlLink Aikiyoda  did do 200 cuts a day while he was in Singapore. In fact he was the one who psychoed me into it as well. I did it consistently until I came to UK. Took me a long time before I got my hands on a bokken. I doubt I can do anything physical exercise consistently until my 1 month Easter break. But by then, it's really time for exams revision. Think Gary said he's gonna be getting a bokken there. Well he's definitely going to be getting another set of gi. Damn sponge monster still dirties the dojo mats everywhere he goes. Ar duh...  OK time to get back to my second essay and project.
