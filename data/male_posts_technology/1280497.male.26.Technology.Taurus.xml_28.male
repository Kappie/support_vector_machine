I think that's sorta what I've got going for me. Sure, I might have a terrible work ethic, generally speaking, but once in a while, something will come along that just grabs me, and then I can focus on it until the cows come home. That's great and all, but I could use some work ethic to help me to sit down and do good, solid work for 10 hours straight.   I need to be able to just sit still, but most of the time, I'm vascillating between working, playing Ms. Pac Man, and browsing news sites. If there were some sort of frequent visitor program with CNN, I would have earned a cruise to Alaska or whatever their biggest reward was (trip to the news headquarters? Weekend getaway to Ted Turner's Montana ranch?). I swear I check news like an obsessive compulsive person washes her hands. What am I so worried about anyway? It's like I'm waiting for the news to be updated in the ten minutes since I last checked it with a headline that says, "Large flood about to hit Provo, Utah. Residents unaware" I'll realize I'm in Provo, become aware, and get out of town, picking up Julie and our unborn child along the way. All that lost productivity will be to our collective gain, and I won't even have to stay late that day. What a day that will be.  I figure, if I can't check the news every ten minutes, the terrorists have already won.   I drew a picture on the board to show my friend Dave the ease with which a young person who has adopted a cowboy identity can become a person who listens to rap music and considers himself/herself a hip-hop "gangster". By assigning initials to the letters for the words "cowboy" and "gangster", I was able to make it look like I was explaining a technical issue that we were discussing. I'm so very tricky. Little do they know.  But I think it is a funny cultural thing, that it seems like the persona of a cowboy, i.e. one who listens to country music, dresses in Wrangler jeans and cowboy boots, and drives a truck or some kind of threatening off roader, is so quickly convertible into the persona of a gangster, i.e. one who listens to rap music, wears more urban clothing, and drives a modified honda civic or some other sedan outfitted with a large stereo. That was a long sentence, but the point is, there must be something in the bravado of both personalities that can attract the same demographic, which is people who identify with a simple struggle for life, liberty, and good wholesome woman-chasing.  Stereotypes abound in the preceding paragraph, I know, but I have some anecdotal evidence to back it up! You see, I was helping to run an event that was held in Southern Utah this weekend, called UROC. For those of you who don't already know,  urlLink UROC  stands for "United Rockcrawling and Offroading Challenge" It is a sport that involves offroading vehicles trying to climb up big rocks. While manning the ticket booth, I saw two types of people (generally speaking, of course): cowboys, which is understandable, and gangster types who drove up with the bass pumping and Eminem or 50 Cent booming on the stereo. The cowboys outnumbered the others, but still, you have to wonder what would make a (wanna-be) urban thug want to go to the dusty desert of St. George to witness rock crawling? The answer, as you may have guessed, is testosterone.
