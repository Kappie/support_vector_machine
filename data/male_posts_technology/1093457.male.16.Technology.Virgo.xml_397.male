The only problem I had in that exam was that I kep forgetting to start a spiderdiagram or a list of things to include in the essay so each time I wrote the introduction THEN did a small list above that. I think it will be okay though. That lepricorn teacher and another English teacher are so rude! They stood right by my table chatting away, flapping pieces of paper right by my ear while I was trying to work. How rude! They could have distracted me (which they did) and damaged my chances of a good grade! Then the lepricorn put her cup of coffee ON MY DESK. HOW OUTRAGEOUS!!!!! I had a good mind to knock it off 'by accident' but couldn't be bothered. Too much effort really. Good luck everyone! I hope you did well!
