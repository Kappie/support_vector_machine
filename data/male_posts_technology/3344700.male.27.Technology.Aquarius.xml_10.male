I came across an interesting article that talks about this solution, Here you can find the information on Connecting HTTPMail Hotmail Gateway, Parsing MailBox folder list, enumerating folder MailItems and much more...This has got a downloadable sample C# source code as well.   urlLink A HTTPMail client under .NET   Happy reading...
