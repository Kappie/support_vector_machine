Now, continue in your minds eye and lets get all these people moving in the same direction, sticking rigidly within their own lanes but have some move at slightly different speeds(nothing drastic mind, just small variations). Now comes the tricky part, once a person catches up with someone in front, you will need to imagine them into the next lane  as long  (now this bits important) as they do not obstruct anyone in doing so (if they do, simply imagine their speed down a bit). Now step back (mentally of course) and admire your creation, looks simple doesn't it, and effective too. Keep the image to mind though, we are going to need it shortly.  So, you have a load of people walking down a pavement, all in the same direction, all roughly the same speed. If one of those people accidently bumped into someone, they would look very silly wouldn't they? I mean, its not often people bump into each other walking through town (and not many pavements have our deluxe three lane design) In fact it would take an act of sheer ignorance/stupidity to get two pedestrians to collide in this collective mental image we have created. Okay, so clearly its easy, the  system  works, one might even say its fool proof.  So why the hell do vehicles collide on the motorway then???  Because when your average fool gets behind the wheel of a car, normal fool physics go out of the window. They change, they evolve. Welcome, dear friends to the Super Breed of Fool, I give you..... The Motorway Driver.  The Motorway Driver would never dream of pushing in the queue of your local supermarket but once he is in a car, he will happily zoom past a large line of traffic waiting to come off and then at the last possible moment signal, stop then push in. The Motorway Driver thinks he is indestructible. Wagons, coaches and other large vehicles are soft and sqidgy so what possible danger could arise from pulling out in front of them? The Motorway Driver doesn't need lights on in bad weather conditions,  he  can see fine, what does it matter? The Motorway Driver doesn't need indicators whilst traveling,  he  sure as hell knows where he is going, isn't it obvious to other drivers too? The Motorway Driver fears nothing, knows exactly where he going and slows for no-one, unless of course there has been an accident on the  other side  of the motorway.
