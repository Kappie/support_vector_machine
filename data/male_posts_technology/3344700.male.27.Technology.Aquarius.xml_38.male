Now my new article  urlLink   Secret-Key Encryption Cryptography in Microsoft .NET    is published. I have also provided a sample code on using Secret-key encryption. You need to have a passport (hotmail or msn ID) to view the article.  When I was preparing the article on Cryptography and Microsoft .Net, I found there are so many topics to be covered under this title. Including all these topics in one will make the single article a lengthy document to present in MSDN and it wont be good enough to read. So I thought of splitting the whole title on Cryptography into different sections like Private (Secret) Key Encryption, Public Key encryption, Cryptograhic Signing, Hashes, Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) etc.   Hope I can able to complete the topics on these titles very soon and contribute the same to MSDN INDIA. These topics would be very interesting and important to learn as well.
