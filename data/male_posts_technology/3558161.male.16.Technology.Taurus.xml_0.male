It's all just a game  I know what it's like.  Lift you up  Held above to see all  This glorious city  Is going to fall.  These blissful waters  Will be awoken to fear  Kick in the door  Seeking your answers  When there are none to be found  Take my hand  And see where I lead  You suffocate the world  And act a breath of air  I fight for reform  And stand as stone.   I won't miss a beat  'Cause I never, never have before.
