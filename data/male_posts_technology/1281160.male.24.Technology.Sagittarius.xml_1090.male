So every thing is new and fresh! feels good except for the absence of AC, which will become operational in a day or too. provided with a new phone too. but what is the use, when i needed it before wedding, it wasnt there, and now..... hardly we talk over phones.  Only thing is, naan mundhi mathiri o.p. adikka mudiyathu, coz my cubicle is just infront of my PM's room. How bad!Ok, atleast from now on, let me start working..........  Hei one more thing guys,  ya, Srini is moving to Sanjose on 2nd of next month and will be there for 6 weeks. will be back by may 3rd week. so till then, i will have to manage things all alone. Hope to do a good job! not a pretty tough job i believe!  y, these days, there arent much posts guys? Post more!
