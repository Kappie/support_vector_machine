If you're not a geek, then you maybe surprised to hear that there is a huge sub-culture of geekiness, dedicated to the art of computer modification. Most of which involves running your computer faster than it's supposed to go, (overclocking) then you add lots of fans because the faster it goes the hotter it gets. Kind of like Jenna Jameson.  Anyway, "Holly" my main PC, is going to be resprayed in stone fleck paint, kind of like a 21st century stone henge. I had just covered her in some black primer, and I have a window kit and a blue lava lamp light to go inside on the way.. photos will be posted when complete.
