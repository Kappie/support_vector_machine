If, like me, you had nothing better to do at 1pm than watch it, I feel great pity for you (and for me?).  The throngs of reporters around him as he walked up with his wife was ridiculous. Why not have one or two cameras, feed it into a pool, and give the man his last dignity. After all, he won't be making a walk like it ever again (a la Winds of Conservative Change).   The idea that this is such a huge media event is just silly. It doesn't even deserve to be labeled with the much hipper word 'ridiculous'. Let's call it what it is, silliness. Do any of the reporters there really expect Paul Martin to drop some type of bombshell announcement as he walks up to have the writ dropped? And if he did drop some tid-bit anyways, wouldn't a single feed for all the networks offer access to the same information?  Ok, so that got more attention, even in this post, then it deserved.  This morning I was out at 7 am putting signs on bridges in the city. There's something about putting up a sign in the pouring rain with lightening starting overhead to make getting involved in a campaign seem fun. If you doubt whether it can really be fun, give it a try (seriously good times)  Tomorrow should bring with it some light door-knocking (after all, it's a holiday  time to relax!)....
