Had 2 cream buns adn 2 pieces of bread for lunch and rush out of the house at 1300hrs.  Arrived Alexandra Hospital around 1350hrs. Saw the doctor in clinic B and then while thinking of "Sunshine Girl" (Alexandra Nutrientist, always had a delighted smile named Ann), she just happened to be a few feet away... We stopped for a short chat asking each other how we've been and waved good bye... Arghhh... I didn't had the courage to ask her out. I'm swear to myself that I'm going to ask her out the next time I see her on my next trip to AH.   State of Condition:   Slightly Motivated   On the way back home, I bought Chicken Rice for dinner.  After dinner, planned a little for tomorrow and finished up what I supposed to do today.Updated Organizer and prepare to write a Blog~Then Zzzz…zzzz…   ORD countdown:   75 days   Why is there a timer for my ORD?   NS is a waste of time…And I serve 16mths with a rank of CPL…
