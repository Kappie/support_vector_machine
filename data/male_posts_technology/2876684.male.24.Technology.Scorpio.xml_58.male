Not that I thought anything bad about the whole Harry Potter phenomenon, it's just that watching the 3rd part of an ongoing series without seeing the ones before is kind of like walking into a conversation that's been going on for a while already... (I also really wanted to watch the Punisher, but we'll talk about that later.)  Anyways after the movie I can understand the following Harry Potter has built up. I'm no critic so I won't try to appraise the film but I will say it was worth the $15 I spent on my ticket. Very few films I've seen lately can claim that!  I was also in Dirt Cheap CDs before watching the movie and there was this long queue at the counter because the POS (point of sale) software decided to crap out and they had to manually write down receipts using carbon paper. I observed them force-quit the software when it crashed and open it up again only to have it crash again. They were also running on Windows 98, so I suggested to the sales staff that they actually shut down the computer or do a restart prior to running the software again.  The girl at the computer replied with, "Yea I've done that already" with a "Get the fuck out of my face I know what I'm doing you cunt" kind of tone in her voice, so I get the hint and shut up and quietly wait for my receipt. Oh well, you try to help some people...   The other girl writing the receipts was more appreciative of my gesture and thanked me, I felt sorry for her though because she would have been writing receipts all day because of her smart-ass colleague.
