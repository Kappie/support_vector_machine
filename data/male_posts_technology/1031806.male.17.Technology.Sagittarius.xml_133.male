I need to get working on that  urlLink lyrics / mp3 page  later. In about a week, I’m going to be completely revamping my computer network at home and hopefully setting up an apache web server to host my site locally. I may just put off working on anything until then, or I may not.... depends on whether I get bored I guess :)   Oh, I'm applying to join a youth newsletter that  urlLink Laurie's  starting. I may post my "trial" article when I finish it later today or tomorrow.
