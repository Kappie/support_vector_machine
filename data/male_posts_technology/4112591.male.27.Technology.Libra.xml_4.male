I just caught the Q  A at the end of his announcement and obvuiousley they were about Iraq and the lies he went to war on.  didnt catch the question but the answer was class. He still maintains he would have gone to war regardless of the false intel, WHAT, he believes he was still right to go to war and keep mentioning links with TERROR, joke ."The world IS abetter place with saddam hussain not in power, ". I am sure GOD told him as they do communicate regularly  you know.    Has he not just decided to have a new drug tzar exactley because the 911 commision has recemended such due to the false intel. the commision has clearly stated there were not links between UBL  Saddam, they hate each other for god sake.  As he was speaking, there was breaking news about guess what, *ELEVATED TERROR STATUS* in new  york  washington, this goes to what I was sayin in my other post today, (see below). New York Cheif of Police was explaining all the restrictions and new security plans.  Bush is dellusional, I have also read reports latly of him being on strong anti-depressants , hes loosing it ,  worrying since it is his finger on that dredded red button  oh where will it all end, enough for now will post more on these issues in the days n weeks to come,  Garlo
