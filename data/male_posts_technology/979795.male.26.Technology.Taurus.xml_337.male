On the 20th, I met up with Begh and Lynette for dinner at my friend's restaurant called Swiss Culture,  Suntec City mall. We had an ultra filling meal there and I think the food there has improved. I have to admit he is doing pretty well. Anyway we had a really good and long chat there as well. In fact, I only just received his housewarming invitation by SMS at his place next Sun. Hopefully my NS kakis will be attending too.  On the eve was reunion dinner with my mom's side of the family. After that, us guys decided to catch the Last Samurai (starring 'Tomu Kurusu' - Tom Cruise ;P). 2 of the ladies went for KTV and another went to catch a midnight with her boyfriend. All our parents decided to go home for the night. I haev to admit, the Japanese actor acting opposite of Tom Cruise did outshine the latter in the show. There was just so much more depth to his character. The action sequences were pretty fantastic too but you can kinda tell Tom Cruise's swordwork, was way different from the Japanese's in the show. Not enough sword fighting scenes as I would've liked as well, but that's just me lah. Thinking of buying the DVD when/if it's released too.  It's the year of the monkey now. These 2 days were quite uneventful save for visiting relatives and friends and vice versa. Got another interview next Tues. Something similar to an interview I went a few days ago. It's to be attached to schools to teach IT. Mr Tan ... haha ... can't imagine students addressing me that. Sounds weird ... dunnoz.   urlLink Gary  finally received the CDs I sent, though he did mention one of the discs seemed a bit dodgy. This week I should be able to attend Aikido. Hope to pop by on Mon. It's been a long time since I managed to put in any serious time into it and I really want to get back on track again. Back hasn't given me any problem past week, but I don't think I'm going to push myself if it still feels weird during training.  One not too happy thing I just remembered. Dad thought he was helping by 'asking' his cousin and brother if there's any job vacancy they might know of. I'm glad there wasn't exactly a response or a positive one. Seriously felt like I was being shoved into an area I don't quite want to be in. Didn't want to put him down for his request in front of others (nor did I when everyone left). -- See 'Hopes and Wishes'. -- And I'm so getting tired of him comparing me with my cousin who just finished his course from NUS too. Same as Gary, just that he took his honours year as well and he's got a good job paying him 2.3k. Dad keeps poking me about why he is good lah, why I'm not lah and all that. Geez ... I'm getting fed up just blogging this down now. But I also recalled soemthing my aunt said to me lastweek. "Afterall lah, he's your father. He want to say let him say lor. It's not like it's some outsider / boss outside telling you off now. It's all within the family." Ar, she's right. So far keeping this sentence in mind helps me a bit but I dunno how long it'll last lah. Ultimately I don't see myself as someone who is willing to back down if I feel that a gauntlet is being thrown in my face.
