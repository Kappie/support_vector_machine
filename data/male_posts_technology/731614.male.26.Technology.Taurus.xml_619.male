No one else knows about my hidden alter ego Stella Enigma, and my crusades as a dominatrix.  Recently, both world have come dreadfully close to clashing, and I can feel the eyes begining to wonder. The ramifications of letting the world know have been holding me back,and I love my family and friends so much that I've kept this inside for far too long.  I've also been considering a sex change operation, but I still like both oysters and snails. Should I start taking the hormones I've been perscribed, or should I seek counseling first?  Please help lead me out of the woods and into the valley!  Dominating,  Stella Enigma
