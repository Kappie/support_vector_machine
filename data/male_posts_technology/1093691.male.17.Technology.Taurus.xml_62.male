Ryan Merriman is an upcoming actor, he has been atcing since he was a kid. He is known at all in the UK. I only know of him because when I went to Florida last year they were premiering a new film of his on zoog disney and I watched like 7 times. It was a brilliant film. So when I got home I looked him up on the ineternet and now I am a solid fan. Happy now or do I have to explain what zoog disney is as well? Armagedon has excellent graphics, it is not a silly movie. Just because something like that hasn't happened doesn't mean it can't etc.. so chil out and just watch it and admire Ben Affleck. Don't worry anyone, you don't have to watch Taken just because I asked people too or the fact that I have been reminding people since a week before the first episode. You are the ones who are missing out on a excellent program, by the makers of Band Of Brothers. No Jackie, you don't have to blog everyday. But it would be handy if people can try and blog at least every 2/3 days. Please.  If you could be one person for the day who would you be?  I'd like to be Ryan Merriman just to see what its like being him as he is filming a vew show at the moment. Or if I had to be a female it would be Jackie because I wouldlove to get inside her head.... :) Jo, yea you can pay £20.  I have another question for you all can you name one boys and one girls name for every letter of the alphabet?
