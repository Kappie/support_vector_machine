I am attempting to speak my thoughts (in a gracious manner) and not lie by pretending I think things are ok when they are not. For example, at work when people start bagging George Bush (whom I unashamedly admire) I intend to tell them what I think of him. It's kind of something I don't really do with people other than my friends, but I intend to start being honest with all people in all areas. (I think my usual silnce is to do with wanting to please everyone and wanting everyone to like me... which explains why I don't have a problem speaking my mind with friends, because they already do like me.)   Pride   "....an exorbitant demand that others believe the lie we have made ourselves believe about ourselves."  Thomas Merton  (I am not by the way suggesting I agree with everything this guy says...)
