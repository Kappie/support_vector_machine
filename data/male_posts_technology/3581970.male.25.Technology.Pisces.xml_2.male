I've got the scouting area almost done, just need to add a somethings to the Scout class and then coaches will be able to ask for a scouting report on a player. I then have to make the coach analyze that report and determine if he/she wants to bring the player in. One that's done doing things like free agency and trading should go by pretty fast.  I've been messing around with the  urlLink Visual C# 2005 Express  and I'm really impressed with what they did with the language. Using Generics is a huge improvement on using straight polymorphism for the collections. The IDE has a lot of automation built into it. They've gone above and beyond to make Refactoring one of the major features in the IDE. I really like the new improvements and can't wait until it comes out. I'm testing out Generics in some of the classes I have in the game(testing out now, not doing a full on conversion) and it really helps out the design of things.
