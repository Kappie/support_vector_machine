Your tech support rep doesn't need to hear your conversations with co-workers about how cute but stupid your pool man is. If you absolutely have to verbally abuse your children/spouse/pets, please don't share the tender moment with us.  If you need to eat (and some of these calls can take a long time, so I understand), please don't chew within range of the receiver. Above all else, DO NOT take the phone to the bathroom with you. If you need to relieve yourself, that's fine, it's a normal function of the human body. But set the phone down while you do it, I don't need to experience it along with you. Taking me to the bathroom with you is one of the few things that earns an instant hang-up from me, and probably from others.  So when you're talking to tech support (or anyone, really) on the phone, please please try to be mindful of what sounds your phone is transmitting to the other person.
