Our remaining three months of time in which to complete the desired work looks to be interrupted by strikes, training, school holidays and such, which is causing us all to feel a real time pressure.  And as the pressure mounts, we becomre clearer in our objectives, more settled in our daily lives and more thoughtful of life after the Terai. I personally am looking at a short period of volunteer work elsewhere in more northern nepal, where i can experience the other dimension to national life and also give my sel acothe world from which to apply fo a job.   Our work here and now is going well. We are currently establishing ourselves in the school, endearing ourselves to teachers and students, learning to teach english and manage big groups of children in activities and becoming accustome to rising at 0530. After school we have time off inside away from the heat, and from four to seven do community work and planning. The general objectives are to establish some community infrastructure from which significant members can work together to source development change from local NGOs, in the form of traing advice and funding on health, education and aricutural issues. The girls of our team are currently trying to strengthen the weak aammaa's groups around the area. Like the Indian system this involves Social workers and mothers tring to implement basic change amongst the families through the mothers. Currently this is disfuncntional where we are but potentially a great agent for change. Santos and I are looking at trying to improve the sustainability og forest management along canalsides and pondbanks, in the interest of natural resource maintenance and reliable firewood supply for the poor families.   As is the season we are constanly being dragged off into the night to celebrate the wedding ceremony of some pubescents we don't know. Because we are white and so celebrities being seen at weddings is of prestige to the family concerned, and of course everyone is very friendly. Weddings are a curious event and of course are a mix of Indian and Nepali traditions. It involves sitting around waiting to be fed whilst watching young men hurriedly assembling scary framework from which to hang brightly coloured banners. (Things are always late here)   Food when it does come is usually quite good but I am often keen to leave soon after as the only other entertainment is rather diabolical. After the young couple have driven past in a car a procession will follow. This means a band of brass drums, all banging and smashing with no kind of plan, topped by the distorted reverberating sound of a man singing and playing an organ effect on a touch insensitive keyboard. This characteristic cacophony can be heard all over from as early as 0530 at this time of year and is quite dreadful. If I sound terribly parochial, please understand that I do in fact love Hindi music and have recentley discovered Ravi shankar on the Sitar. But back to the procession. Following the man, with his microphone and his maraude you will just about see through the crowd of fascinated on lookers a young nepali boy dressed as a woman, being circled by a handful of bold or inebriated men barely controlling their frustrated impulses.   Speaking of circling we saw a dead buffallo with its organs exposed through its chewed up ribcages smelling like (a dead buffallo)  and about a hundred huge vultures each with a wing span of at least two metres. However when ever we tried to get close to a vulture it squawks and flees scaring the flock away. Cowardly beasts.   Hope this wasnt too boring :)   bye   From Joel's Nepali Adventures.
