"And as to what was going on here....well, there was lots of activity.  Did you know that Blandane herself was out in the Marches?  She was.  I saw it.  Beleth too, if what I heard is right.  And while you were saving the world that way there were two dozen other angels doing the same thing in different fights different places.  You aren't the only agent of Heaven, you realize."  He smiles again.  "Yes, I realize that your partner is diabolical.  But there are very few who would take such a distinction personally.  Blandane is a political neophite.  She doesn't  understand.  In the end, really, we're all angels...some are just flipsides of the others.  Even Dominic (Judgement) understands that."  "As to the humans...mortals have a surprising way of picking themselves up from reality and carrying on as before.  YOu'll be amazed!  The truth is always the truth, and it will always set you free.  Don't worry, you did well.  Trust yourself."
