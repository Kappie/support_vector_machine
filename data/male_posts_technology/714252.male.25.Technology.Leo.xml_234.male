I think I am slowly managing to come to grips with my work stuff and I am having to just get on with my personal stuff so things can't really afford to be anything other than good.  Actually I am in a good mood now. Had a great time last night and am in a general all round good mood now.. Lets see how long it lasts..  I suppose I had better let you all in on some of what has been happening.  The big thing is that Karl has left the company. That's a good thing for Karl and an OK thing for me so far but it was done in quite a bit of a hurry and wasn't thought out properly which left me with a LOT of mess to clean up.. Hence the stress and the like..  On the up side it will mean that by the end of the month costs will have roughly halfed and the sole stock holder will be me.. Who says there is never a silver lining?  K, I got to get back to work (again) The big downside at the moment is that no matter how much I do I still have 25 things left on the list.. It should only take me a week or two to get it all sorted out but for the moment work is REALLY work..
