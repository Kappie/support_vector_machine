Rather than the cute little status clock thing coming up telling me my blog was 50 . . . 70 . . . 100% published, I got the big 404 error. Maddening.  Still, it seemed like a site problem. When everything else is working and a single page seems to be down, I generally assume it isn't a client-side error.  At least not until now. In Internet Explorer's constant battle to drive me insane, the bar has been raised.  It was as an afterthought that I tried publishing in Firefox. It worked just fine. Go figure.  I've known IE (actually, Crazy Browser, which is IE hacked with tab and integrated Google functionality--up till now the most convenient browser I've ever used) was taking on water for a while now, I just didn't want to switch. I'm lazy. Also though, Firefox doesn't seem to like the Flash installs I do. I install, and Flash works until I reboot. I then have to reinstall. Annoying. So maybe it's IE for browsing and Firefox for the important stuff.  My eLife is beginning to take on the complications of my real life. So much for escapism.  Also, for some god-unknown reason, IE won't display my picture of Vizzini from the blog about Socialism. I had to get image hosting because I'd been just direct-link ganking pictures from sites to suit my needs, but every picture of Vizzini I could find was hosted on Angel Fire or some other site that doesn't allow direct-linking. So I got some space at imageshack.us. Except the pic wouldn't render. I tried a few different things, but eventually gave up.  Then today, on Firefox, there is Vizzini in all his glory. Bleh.  And now this brilliance. Firefox keeps the formatting from Word when I cut and paste. That's something I would expect from a Microsoft browser. Firefox it is.      “I fell asleep, he musta crawled in there for warmth.”        *     *     *
