Working in the garden, working on the house - but not jobs of any great note.  Over the next few weeks I'm going to sort out a new base for both the shed and the greenhouse, but dull blog fodder really!  The most interesting thing to happen recently was getting my mobile phone pinched at the fun-fair yesterday, but even that doesn't bother me that much, as work will replace it for me anyway....
