Work has really kicked up as I am now on the phones full time.  I still do not really know all the answers at work and it gets frustrating sometimes because it is not my computer knowledge that is lacking, but the specific program knowledge.  I know that will come though.  Maurice, a co-worker at Liberty, started today.  I got all my insurance info in the mail this week including the all important card for the wallet.  Overall, this has been a very good month.  With the long distance minutes on my cell phone and calling cards I have been able to talk to her quite a bit.  We are also writing letters back and forth...kind of like pen pals.  Kristin, Bethy and Marissa have been keeping me busy.  We have had game night about every week and last Thuursday I hosted a  Survivor  get together.    Justin has also been hanging out quite a bit.  This is a good thing.  He and Sarah seem to be doing well.   That is also good.  That is all I can think of for now...
