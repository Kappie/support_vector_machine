Btw, I was kinda decided that if I was dumped by Claire, I shall shave my head... now I was wondering if i should do it or not.  Coz it seems like i'm still going after her... we talked on the phone for like 3 hours last night until I said I gotta goto bed (actually gotta go warcraft...)...  Sign ...
