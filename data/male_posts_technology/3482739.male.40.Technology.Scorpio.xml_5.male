Then I asked, no one in particular, what it is about his music that almost always brings tears to my eyes?!  If anyone can explain it, I'd be interested.  I was listening to a song apparently called "Covenent Woman."  Whoa.  Really liked it.  Its sort of funny to me that its taken me this long to 'really' be into Mr. D to this degree given how long I've been into the Grateful Dead, and Bluegrass.  Actually, the realization that I liked Dylan much more that I would have otherwise thought came at the Phil  Friends / Dylan show the the Gorge in George, WA.  I remember being very dissappointed in P, but that Dylan had gotten me to straight up crying during a few songs.  It was then that I decided I needed to give the Bobster another listen.  This is actually happening fairly slowly, but has accelerated in recent days as I've gotten some live stuff off the internet.
