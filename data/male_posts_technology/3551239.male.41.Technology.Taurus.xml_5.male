Marty and Jude seem to have everything under control now and I can finally relax, but I just can't seem to settle down. There is something strange going on with TOBI, and everyone seems to be aware of it, although none of the boys want to talk about it. I do hope they're careful...  Enough - I've decided that it's time to get back to my darling Virginia, I've missed her so. I wonder if she'll have some of those delicious sugar cookies ready when I get there...
