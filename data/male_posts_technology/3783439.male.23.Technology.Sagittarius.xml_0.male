This could all be crap but it is quite funny.  Microsoft a quick note:  inovation != Stealing others ideas  and yes i'm still pissed that Altavista went portal in the 90's!   BTW this bit of news is also mentioned on  urlLink Slashdot  I'm sure the guys over there are pleased to hear about this one :)
