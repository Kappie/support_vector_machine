She said: " Nizoo 7abibi, the minute i heard your voice, i found out how much i missed you, how much you mean to me and how much i love you". Isn't this the most romantic thing a bird can say to her boy?   I ask you lord to watch her in every step she make, i ask you to send her an angel every time she is in need. God...Oh god...Writing this post made me realize how much i love her.   I'm feeling great, just great. I'm listing to the Diva, Annie Lennox - "Here Comes The Rain Again" from the best of MTV Unplugged album, great song, it fits perfectly in this situation.    Here comes the rain again  Falling on my head like a memory  Falling on my head like a new emotion  I want to walk in the open wind  I want to talk like lovers do  I want to dive into your ocean  Is it raining with you  So baby talk to me  Like lovers do  Walk with me  Like lovers do  Talk to me  Like lovers do....     I guess i've found me somebody to love. Ok, that was really outstanding.. I think i better go to sleep now in a good mood.. In sweet emotions.
