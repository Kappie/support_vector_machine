I couldn't quite figure out who that was, but it evoked memories of trivia club long ago-- was it college or high school? The message was marked with a digital signature and titled, "Sorry to be the bearer of bad news..." I delayed opening it while I read other messages, trying in the back of my head to figure out what bad news this guy could have for me; I could barely even remember who he was. Finally, I opened it:  "A friend named Eric is trying to get in touch with you, so I looked up your address in the Case directory."  A quick mental scan produced a few Erics. I began to realize that it was bad news, bad enough that someone would track me down to tell me. I saw myself on film, all of sudden. I followed the link he had responded to.  "A mutual friend of ours died suddenly today"  It was Eric from high school drama, who I hung out with several nights a week for a few years. Who was the mutual friend? My one and only ex-girlfriend? I did some searches, and came across, Eric's blog; three entries about death in the past day. Scanning... scanning... No. It was Kate. Katie-Mae. Katja. Dead. My chest tightened up, surprised and not surprised in so many ways.  I feel a need to write about Kate because I feel much sadder about this than I would have expected. I met Kate during my early days in the Roger Bacon drama guild. We were auditioning for a show-- she showed up late, slouching in some low slung plumber jeans, a white T-shirt, and a denim cap pulled down too low, her light brown pony tail sticking through the back. I noticed her first when she shrieked loud and crazy with glee and took off bounding across the auditorium towards some innocent bystander, then lunged into a grand embrace. I didn't like her.  I have no recollection of how we got to being such good friends, but I must explain to my readers that Kate was nearly my opposite in every way. She was short, extroverted, gay, failing out of school, doing and selling lots of drug, etc. We hung out nearly every day. I've never really understood our friendship. My mother theorizes that I was trying to rescue her, but I don't think that was the case. Well, admittedly I was hoping that I could influence her to quit with the self-destructive habits. I did influence her some. She gave it all up and restored her relationship with her step-mother; I even went with her to AA meetings for a while. She went back to her old ways after a few months, but I found out that since I last heard from her about 6 years ago, she got cleaned up and was doing really well selling  urlLink paintings  like hotcakes somewhere in California. Then she died.  Since last talking to Kate, I've often wondered if she was in a gutter or still alive even, or if I might run into her in a bookstore somewhere. I've somewhat resented her for disappearing. She traveled like a vagrant making it very difficult to keep up with her. But, I've been sitting here in Cleveland for the past eight years. I wanted her to find me and tell me how life was going-- I guess I missed her, even though I also cynically referred to her as my lesbo druggie friend of old. I must admit, I've been keeping an eye open for Kate all these years. Maybe, I'll get to see her this weekend in Cincy. *sniff* She's the kind of friend, I was just saying I wanted.  Perhaps, I'll write some more later, after I talk to Eric-- I'm still a bit shocked.
