The one in the pic is a sleek silver with the odd thumb thing on the side being black. Nice colours sure - I get the white and biege model that you couldn't fucking give away if you tried.  No scroll wheel!? Who the hell makes a mouse with no scroll wheel nowadays? Wait, better question, who buys one!? Yep, you know it - my work.  So, I've been using it for a couple hours now and its seriously the biggest, most clumsy piece of garbage mouse I've ever used. But its comfortable! ......... blegh
