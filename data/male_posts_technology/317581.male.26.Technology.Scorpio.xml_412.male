By and large, I would have to say, I have felt that people are naturally good. I think I grew to believe this due to the fact that I grew up in the church and am naturally a kind and caring person.  This actually helped me have blind faith in my government and my church.    I have come to change these beliefs recently....  People are still dying in Iraq. People are still dying in Afghanistan. Not to change questions, but why? Why are we still there? Why is there death in the world? Why don't trickle down economics work? Why doesn't communism work? Are republicans the cynics? or the democrats? or is it the growing population of independents?  These are the questions I'm dealing with right now...  Just thought you could use a little update Peace out- Tim
