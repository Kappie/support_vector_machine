Little do they realise that all displays run the risks of exposure.Inspite of it I decieve myself with emotions of fortitude and redecorate my binary home with a new post.  This is taking on the mantle of a distinguished display of a motley of thought flows , so profound that often the expresser is at a loss for words himself.Impromptu and distinguished though all blogs might seem , the steel is actually melted by the travails of time. Discipline is a virtue that is seldom embraced and often the carpet has enough room for discarded virtues such as the former.  Under one such dusty carpet rests my unfinished blog.  Time the destroyer is a different actor now, it has upon itself the mantle of a distinguished teacher who has laid emphasis on this difficult task of regularity.Thus the dust is blown off my digital canvas and here I wield this moulded pad of polymerised hydrocarbons to paint my garbles.Sometimes i do not understand my own inscriptions and to protect my dwindling intellect in such weak moments - my last line says " I'm typing on my keyboard".
