Following standard procedure, I brought in a pound of M  Against standard procedure, I actually brought in a pound of M in three different flavors (plain, peanut and crispy (which is crispy in the sense of Nestle Crunch bars: crisped rice)).  It feels fairly odd that I've already been here for a year.  I've done so much, but it also seems like I could have accomplished more.  I shouldn't really complain, there are others that started around the same time I did that haven't done much at all.  

There are actually a few people that have started recently (one started two years ago and two others started a year ago) that are leaving the company.  One is getting married, another is going to school and another is starting a company.  It should be publicly known, but Microsoft is reducing their benefits.  It just looks like there isn't enough to keep people around anymore.
