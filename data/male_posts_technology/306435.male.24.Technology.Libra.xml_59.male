I missed an exit on the way to the Art Museum (where I was meeting Ann and her family) and was able to navigate my way tere.  I was proud of that. Milwaukee was good, but seeing Ann was the best part.  I got to meet her parents, sister and a few friends.  One of the highlights was the persuaing of a VP at Fortis to buy us a round on New Years Eve.  Oh, and I cannot forget about the dance stylings of the one and only Tanner and his Green Bay jacket. Okay, I will try to update more likely.
