Although I don't know why I'm laughing - there are obviously millions of idiots who do open the attachments which can be seen by how rapidly these buggers spread.    Anyway after my antivirus software updated this morning it identified them as mimail.s - apparently it pops up a dialog box and prompts for credit card details. Ooh had a lucky escape there - I of course would have entered my credit card details into any old random box that popped up.
