If you also get the urge to commit acts of homicide in your cubicle try heading over to  Ebaums World   most likely the best collection of all things funny on the Internet in one place.  If your work place is more forgiving of adult themed humor try  Kontraband  they have a butt ton of fun games and videos, some not all have a little T  A (that tits and ass for the handicapped).  Check out the sound boards a Ebaums if you get the chance, but be warned it my cause some urinal leakage.
