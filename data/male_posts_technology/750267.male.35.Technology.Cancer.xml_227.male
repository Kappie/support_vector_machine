It seems several sport federations are adopting this new test, and even retesting urine samples collected at past sporting events. The results of these retests will be interesting indeed!  The rumours circulating are that drug use is rampant in amateur sports. American athletes, in particular, are under great pressure to succeed at sports. And this pressure (along with the money and endorsement deals involved) can lead some athletes to cheat if they thought they could get away with it.  So does this new test throw a monkey wrench in the cheater's plans? Or have the athletes and their coaches been aware of this new test for months, and have switched to other undetectable steroids?  We'll see.
