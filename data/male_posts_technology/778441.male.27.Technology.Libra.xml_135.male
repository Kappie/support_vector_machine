A new variant of the Yaha virus that appeared just before Christmas has proved very contagious, infecting thousands of computers worldwide.   urlLink Symantec  has named the virus as W32.Yaha.K@mm. It arrives as an attachment of the form  .exe  or  .scr  with lots of various subject lines and message bodies. The virus has its own email client which it uses to propagate itself out to the contacts listed in your address books. Moreover, it tries to close down firewalls and anti-virus softwares.  So, beware of that cute screen-saver that might appear to come from a dear friend of yours! :)  Be informed!
