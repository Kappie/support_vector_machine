But for his heroic stature in the history of science, it is important to remember that he was just a man. He was known for having poor interpersonal skills, and for moods and rages. He was a product of his times, and he loved and hated much we might decry today.   Such is progress.   May we advance so much that our current enlightenment is also thus seen as a stepping stone to true wisdom.   To one million more.  Happy Hollidays.
