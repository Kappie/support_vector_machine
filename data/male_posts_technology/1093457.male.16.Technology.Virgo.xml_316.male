Okay, I admit, I have been nrevising a lot, but I am still fiding time to pop in here and blog, to let whoever bothers to read the blog know what's going on in our little world!  Well, today it is still sunny but there is quite a strong wind, therefore it is nowhere near as hot as yesterday. However, sitting in a south-facing room with all the w indows shut, I am sweltering. Mother and Father are destroying the patio (it has one end missing now and a big hole in the middle) with sledge hammers, apparently it has sunk and they need to re-set it? Well, I haven't a clue what they're doing but they've just discovered it is built on mud (ha ha, yet another botch job from the builders!), and dad has got all of next week off to do it. Except he is going to a motorbike show on Monday. Louise is lying in the hammock (very suave) wearing a suntop, sunglasses and a towwl (not quite sure what happened to the rest of her clothes), and reading Harry Potter 4. Nancy is at the bottom of the garden wearing a pair of polythene gloves (??) And playing with a friend's guinea pigs that we are looking after while they are away in the Peak District. I suppose I sholudb't complain that they're down the garden, earlier Louise marched in and demanded that I held one of the pigs whilst she made a cup of tea. Animals are fair enough, but when you have to hold them for long periiods of time you begin to wonder how strong their bladders are. But I guess guinea pigs' bladders are stronger than my little cousin Matthew's (aged 2 1/2, visited yesterday), as sometime yesterday afternoon he managed to wee down Louise's top. That's a bit worrying, cos I've just realised that Louise is wearing the top again today and there was no wash load done last night..................... At the moment I'm in the middle of writing out ALL my geography case studies onto little cue cards, so I can play snap like games! Yay! I have done 3 out of 6 of my French aural topics, so I'm gradually getting there, I just need to go through them all and get mother to tell me how to pronounce half the words, lol! When I've finished the geography case studies I think I will go on and do some more on the Cold War, as I need to brush up on the space race and the arms race. It's always the things that you haven't revised properly that come up on the damned exams, so I'm gonna try and make sure i know everyhting inside-ou by the time we get to the exams! I have a month till the first exam (Music and RE on the first day), and then another week before any more exams (thank god for half terms!!). So really I'm stressing about things that aren't really gonna be that big a problem (I sincerely hope!). I just need a bit more sself-discipline, so I can work for 2 hours instead of giving up after and hour and then playing 30 minutes on this fab game called 'Super Bounce Out'. Oh the joys. Please blog guys (do I sound like Nicki?!!!) cos I am as bored as hell, haven't spoke to any of my friends for ages, and I'll go insane if there's nothign to do apart from play with various virtual multi-coloured rubber bouncy balls. Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee guys.
