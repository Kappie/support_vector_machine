She claims that she is "on the run" from her rich and powerful family, whom want to marry her off in a prearranged marriage. She also says she was able to take a lot of money with her, so her early blog entries are mostly about finding a discreet money manager and a good lawyer. Who knows if it's real or not? But even if it's fake, it's a compelling story.  * Wired magazine has a big feature this month on the  urlLink Wireless revolution . That's ironic. 10 years ago, the big revolution was that everyone was getting wired, thus inspiring the name of the magazine. Now it's hip to be wireless. Only lamers are wired, right? They'll soon have to change the name of the magazine to remain cool...  * Matrix 2 looks really cool. Can't wait.  * There's a new audio tape purporting to be from Saddam Hussein. They know it's recent, because the voice on the tape thanks the Iraqis who were out on the street celebrating his birthday a couple of weeks ago.  * Apparently, Uday Hussein withdrew $1 billion in cash from the Iraqi central bank just days before the start of the war. Bank employees thought that was odd, since normally he just withdraws "small amounts... like $5 million". Ah yes, apparently in Iraq, $5 million is considered a small bank withdrawl.
