(i did leave 2 peices form yesterday to do today) Erm that phot thing is stupid and took age, my legs were acheing after that, and boy my picture is gonna look like shit! Erm i would like to say Miss Shar is usless, she talks on bout nothing so we dont get any of the info we are ment to get and we always end up walking out of the classroom with her still yabbering on bout nothing! I had four frigging lessons today, i think General studies is gonna be a load of bollocks, if id wanted to take 5 subjects i woulda done! No one said nothing bout doing general studies wen we applied did they! Grrrrrrrr What a bloddy waste of time! And not to mention energy, i do hope we dont get homeowrk for that cause i got enuf already, that probably being cause i got a bout 13 teachers and im only doing 3 subjects! Which means with every teacher i get homework, but fortuantly it means that it doesnt have to be in for ages cause i dont have then again for like a week! I now how 3 fat text books to carry to skool everyday and not to mention the 3 folders i also have to bring to skool with all my work in, by the end of the year im gona have no arms left cause they will of dropped off! Wahey this is a long blog for me, i think its cause im in a  oaning mood and im taking a break form teh 4th peice of homework of the nite! I'm not used to this, back in the good ole days of yr 11 i could leave it till the last minute and srill have to time to eat a cake! But not now as each peice takes like an hour or more to do! I Cant cope and im saying this after only  4 days at school! lol Im sure ill ajust to the lifestyle, it sounds better than urs Jo, you seen to have mountains of homwork and hardly ne free periods! Mine have gone done to 11 now cause of stu[id general studies! I would like to apoliguise for my poor spelling and grammar but i cant be bothered to check through it and make sure it makes sence! Hehe im lazy! Well thats bout it from me, im off to continue my Health and Social Care homework in which i have to read a newspaper and then rite about it and challenge its contents! Ahhhhhhhh
