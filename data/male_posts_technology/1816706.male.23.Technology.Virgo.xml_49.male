Actually, some of my family is coming out later in July on Kauai and I'm gonna go meet up with them, and then my parents are talking about coming out again at Xmas so that'll be sweet.  Had a good time Andy's first weekend out here, we checked out Waimea Bay and jumped off the big ass rock again out there, then ate at Cholos mexican restaurant there.  Hit up Duke's, went to swim in Waikiki, saw some prostitutes cruisin the street.  Went to Magoos, swam out to Chinaman's hat and then hiked to the top.  Went to Mai Thai bar last night.  You know just another crappy weekend in paradise, but hey, you gotta be somewhere.
