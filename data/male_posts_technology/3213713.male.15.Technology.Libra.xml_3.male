Dad was getting the store cleaned again so I had to go and help. But just b4 that, I sat on my pc and checked mails, etc. Then, I toiled in the heat for a couple of hours, occasionaly sneaking in and getting to my pc :p. I skipped lunch and continued helping dad. I need to please him ;) !! Neways, this continued till bout 4. I was stinking by then so i had a bath. Sat at my pc for some time. Posted at the forum and chatted. Called Hamza and told him not to come as i was tired and was in no mood to jog :p.  Then, mom called me and told me to help in the kitchen. She was making pizzas with my chachi for the feast. My cousin had gotten pretty godd marks in her 9th exams so there was kinda a celebration. I helped her for some time. Then, I came online again. Posted some more and chatted. Read news and stuff. Then, I went downstairs again to check on the pizzas bcz i was too damn hungry!! Still not ready... so i decided to read the newspaper for a change :p. It was the same old boring stuff. The only interesting thing was the article on Marlon Brando. Neways, finally the food came and i dug in. They were yummy and i dont remember how many pieces i ate... but i didnt get up b4 i was full :p.  I came back to my pc and decided to play underground but Adil came managed to get dad ti tell me to get off the pc. And, u know i cant say no to dad ;). So, I left my pc and looked for a DVD to watch. I found Freaky Friday. So, I put it on and hoped to get myself involved for the next couple of hours. It was a nice movie and the girl reminded of someone ;)... When the movie finished, I got back to my pc. But, just then dad's friend came over with his family. So, I had to go sit with them :s. They just left a couple of minutes back. And since then, ive been chatting, posting, and blogging. Now, im gonna start working on Farazeh's signature... partly bcz she just came online and is gonna ask me bout it!! :p  Lol... she just left and is gonna be back in 10 min... so I better start. Now, I'll be working on the sig till late and chatting with her and hanny. Till 2moro... ciao!
