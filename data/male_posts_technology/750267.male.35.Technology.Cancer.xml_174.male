However, some people have already speculated that, a year from now when the honeymoon period is over, Gov. Terminator might also be kicked out in a recall as well.   So, the question arises... do recalls help democracy, or hurt it?   As with anything, there are two ways to look at it. On the pro-recall side, if a politician betrays the people's trust and becomes wildly unpopular, why should he be allowed to stay in office for three more years before the next election? It seems to me that the prudent thing to do is remove the incompetent politician before he screws things up beyond repair.  But one of the benefits of having elections every 4 years (as opposed to every year, or every 3 months) is that a politician has a chance to "do the right thing" every once and a while, regardless of whether it's the most popular option. For instance, when seat belts were first made mandatory, I imagine it was an unpopular decision. But in hindsight, it was the right decision.  There are some things that are never popular and some that are always popular. For instance, raising taxes (no matter how insignificant or for what purpose) will largely be unpopular. Or cutting spending on police will usually be unpopular. But here's the thing: sometimes unpopular things must be done. Now who's going to do them? Who will be the one to raise taxes when the city/state/country is facing a dire budget situation? Who will be the one to cut military or police spending, even if there is a lot of wasted money in those departments?   Having frequent recall votes forces a politician to worry more about popularity and less about doing the right thing. Many times, the right thing is the popular thing. But sometimes, its not...
