Jobs said Apple was cutting prices of two iPods -- offering a 1,000-song model for $299 and a 2,000-song model for $399 -- and introducing a 4,000-song model for $499."

 Can't wait to get my hands on one of these (20 Gigs). I think Steve Job's said they will be available sometime in August. He wants to get the new iPods to the Mac faithful first.
