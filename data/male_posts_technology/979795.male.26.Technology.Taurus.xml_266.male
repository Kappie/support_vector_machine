Her return flight back to the UK from Singapore will be the 27th of Aug because medical students will be starting their term 1 mth before the usual time on the 1st of Sep.  Today I met up with most of my housemates in UK. All but David managed to go out for dinner. It was an expensive but happy day. Of course, it was a real pity I had to excuse myself from Hattori Sensei's seminar at BVCC but because Annie will be around for a short time before I needed to go back to NS, I really had to juggle my time between Aikido and her.  Most of us met at City Hall around the afternoon. Then we went around the area to look around. Spent awhile at Citylink mall and then went for dinner all together at Marche in Suntec. After that we took a short walk to Esplanade mall to look at the night view of the area there. It was really nice. I must admit, the new look looks much better than the old days.  It was disappointing that the night ended so early but becasue Justin and Daniel had to return to base early tomorrow morning so we all went home pretty early.  For me, tomorrow is the start of the Aikicamp and I'm suppose to go down to help move the mats. I had previously arranged to meet Richard at about 10-1030 in the morning, but I needed to collect my glasses and the shop only opens at 1030am. SMSed Richard and he said it was ok and I could make the 2nd trip down to shift the mats. I've a feeling it's gonna be a great camp and a great day tomorrow.
