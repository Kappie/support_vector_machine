To the troops and my fellow veterans, I also say:   Thank you.      urlLink Of The Troops, For the Troops .  urlLink This we'll Defend .  urlLink Uno Ab Alto (One over all) .  urlLink Non sibi sed patriae (Not for self, but country) .  urlLink Semper Fidelis (Always Faithful) .  urlLink Semper Paratus (Always Ready) .
