I am charged up even with the challenge to go and make an impact to our China bros and sis . My challenge is even given by God is to make an impression of Jesus and change their mindset of what a Christian is to them , before i moved out of my house.  Indeed Ker Ching( I tink this is the spelling, well it sound like this) , a simple underground family preacher called by God to preach the good news to the people of China. What impresses me is that this preacher is called to preach the Word by her villagers , simply because she is a bit more educated  and can read the scriptures better than the elders of the villagers.  China, as she revealed , have indeed open the doors to the world and not just that China have open the doors to revivals...yes with a s. Ker Ching is the product of the second wave of revival sweeping through the northern China , where not one individual or family have not known Jesus . In fact few villages have come to know Jesus and accepted Him as their Lord and Saviour. Even as she shared the testimonies ...there are miracles . Signs and wonders are the footsteps of Jesus ...in His Ministry and so is this time...where the Spirit go, miracles follows.  There was the time when every villagers in the whole village accepted Jesus saved one, the chief. He was a true non Christian and even tried to block his wive and child from knowing Jesus. So the village prayed for his salvation and they fasted for it. That certain day, his child have gone sick . The hospital was very far away from the village, and so he travelled that far , worried sick and trying to get a doctor to heal his son. Incidentally or God-planned, the doctor of the hospital happens to be a revivalist and he knew of the chief. The doctor told the chief that no medicine here nor treatment would heal His Son.  The doctor told the chief to repent of His Sins, and go to the church of his village and ask them for healing. So desperately and for the sake of his love for his son, he took his son back home and then he went to the church to accept Christ and later asked them to heal his son. The pastor of the church told the chief, to go back to his house and see his son, for his son have been healed at the very moment. When he went back, he is suprised to see his son completely healed.  Now is that familiar to you, found in the book of Acts, is indeed happening in China. Ker Ching told us that when they read the signs and wonders in the bible, they are not suprised because these things are happening in China, in their village street and homes.  Ps Samuel Lai 's team from Hong Kong and China can easily attest to that. Most mission pastors i have figured out are uneducated  young and willing people that God have pulled to service. Ker Ching , family underground pastor who is a miracle itself when she is called to come to Malaysia . Because of her background, with her work in the underground churches, her name is blacklisted and therfore cannot get a passport to go to anywhere.Such is her influence.  Her testimonies goes like this , she prayed that if God have really meant for her to come to Malaysia, she believed that God  will provide her the way and the passport to come to Malaysia. She asked a sister in christ on the way to get a passport because she is poorly uneducated and therefore do not know how to get her documentation necessary to get to Malaysia. That sister said that with her background that there is no way for her to get a passport . The politicians know of her name but have yet to  know her face..The sister suggested that she can register under someone 's name. But Ker CHing thought , she is going to apply a passport for five years and she can't bear to use someone'else name and which is why she decided to pray that prayer.  So when she got her documentation, she asked that same sister to accompany her to the police station to get her passport. The sister said that she would not , that if Ke Ching is caught by the police to be interrogated because of her work with the people. that sister is there to save her.  So Ke  Ching  decided to go to police station alone with all her pastoral team sending her off and standing at the edge of  the street leading to the police station.The mood is so filled with tension, as many of her co worker and parents including her mom and brother have usually been caught and been interrogated for hours because of her work with the Lord. But she is determined and she walked by faith. When she went to the police station , she met up with the same policeman who have caught and interrogated  her pastor last month. Undeterred she continue with her registration of the passport. Tension continue to mount as she is asked whether her name is Ke Ching and she said yes and this continue another time. She is then asked that her documentation have been prepared and written in English as she is explained that the Immigration department in Malaysia can't understand  Chinese so It should be prepared in English. She said that she have prepared it. She is then told , that everything plus her passport will be send to her place in a week 's time.  The minute she walk out of the police station unharmed, she called the sister who was supposed to rescue her, and told her the miracle,. The fact that she is able to come to Malaysia is a miracle.   Ker Chin's testimonies of what background she comes from reveals even a bigger clue to what happens to China. There is a major revival happening in the northen china where not one individual or family have not known Jesus as their saviour . Ker Chin is the second generation Christian in the family and she accepted Christ during this wave of revival. Each time when they read the books of Acts and the bible which states the miracles and wonders that happens, they are not even suprised because all this happens right in front of their doorsteps and people in the street fell on their knees and repent and accepted Christ.  Some of her testimonies are like this reffering to the blind sees and the lame walks. Even in the time of baptising the people , miracles happens. In the usual time of baptisizing people in the northen China,   no matter how sacred it is , it have to be a secret from the government. The best times to baptize people is usually winter because the police and the government do not go out and restrict people. Because also the number of people they are baptisizing  involves thousand of people , they have to do this baptism out in the mountain during the winter.  Before they get baptisized in the lake , the co worker of the pastoral team have to crush the frozen lake and melt the ice to form a pool of water to baptisize. That is how cold it is. Most of the people especially the pastors are uneducated and never got theological training as well as the proper training to baptize people. Later i will tell you how most pastors came about. So the pastoral team would baptisize people , each 3 times of immersion , each in the name of the Father, then in the name of The and the last time  in the Holy Spirit.  It was during the time of baptism, one of the candidates requested to be baptized. He was 73 years old and have asthma. The pastoral team  would be hesistant to baptisize this old man in fear he would die on the spot because of his ashmatic condition. But the old man persisted and insisted that if he were to die on the spot, he would just go home to His Father faster. So at last the pastoral team  baptisizes this person and lo and behold, the moment he came from the pool of cold water drenched in the cold winter, his asthma have been completely healed. There are people who are blind who came to see and the lame walk during this baptism.  The calling of the pastors are also a miracle from God proving God have prepared and chose the most unlikely people to serve  Him especially in the pastoral team. Ker Chin was called as a pastor because she is the only one in her village who is educated  and can read scriptures fluently. One day as the pastor read the scriptures and ask Ker Ching to read it and she did it so  beautifully that the people of God requested her to read the scriptures. At that time she is only 19.She argued that she doesn't  know how to expound the scriptures and she have no training but the elders agreed that she can start by reading the scriptures. Even then a lot of the elders can draw meaning from the reading. Slowly God's Holy Spirit begin to empower the moment she steps  to pulpit to read God's word. God slowly reveal to her and gave her the wisdom to understand and expound the scriptures.  Today she pastors churches and training new pastors for the underground church. For one with no theological training , God have  empowered her to lead many churches and people to Christ.God slowly also give her the burden to reach out the people in the  central city of Chinas.    The revival is so major that anyone who knows how to read regardless whether they know Christ or not are being pulled by the congregation. For instance in this village, everyone have acceped Christ, there was this one young boy who have not accepted Christ and he is being invited to come to church . Everyone who is as usual from the agriculture background with not much or no education at all, can t read properly. So they ask this young boy to come to church specially just to read the scriptures because he is educated. Later on, because the reading of the scriptures have an effect on this young boy, he repented and now that He have become a pastor of one of the  underground churches.  Ker Ching mentioned the land or the harvest is so plentiful that it seems God is on the Throne in heaven and He starts to pick  His workers randomly in order to care for His people.   God is indeed Good and His name is glorified every second in China and all around the world
