If you think back to the early Whistler builds, which featured the "Watercolor" visual style, you'll get the right idea: Longhorn is a work in progress, mostly current generation technology, and much of what's in there is just the same old stuff from XP. Major UI work, a database-based file system, integrated DVD burning, and other cool features are still to come."

 urlLink   

 The feature I like best is the "sidebar" functionality. This is similar to the " urlLink Dashboard " in MSN 8.0 which I can't live without now that I have been using it regularly. The funny thing is I have been using  urlLink my own poor-man's version  for years. Ever since IE 4.0, I have been using the "links toolbar" that you can pull out from the bottom toolbar, and place on any side of the screen, and then set it to "auto-hide". It was great way to get to all the apps I used on a regular basis, but it never had real-time data integrated into it.
