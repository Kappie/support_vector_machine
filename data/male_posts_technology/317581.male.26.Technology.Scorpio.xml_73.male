Men masturbate, we do, it's not like you're going to find one that doesn't. I think it's bullshit that we can't come to grips with this as a society.   The perfect guy is bullshit. I think that women are looking for this guy they think they want, but they never really want it when they get it. Women want a strong man that isn't a bully and that is handsome and never screws up. However, by definition, Man is going to screw up, you women just need to learn how to live with it. We're going to piss you off occasionally.   I'm still trying to figure out what women want. I tried to be the sensitive guy, but then they were just like "I like you but not like that", of course I was going after christian girls and my buddy says that they're just cockteases. Not my words, his. Unfortunately, I don't get out much, and when I do I don't drink enough to lose all inhibitions. But really, what's a guy to do?  Well, I should go to bed, I can't think clearly anyway, check you latah-
