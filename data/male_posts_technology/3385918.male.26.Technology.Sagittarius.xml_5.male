She also said in the note that since that other PC was running on a clients network, I was not aloud to surf the net there. Which is funny because all my coworkers still have access to the net through there, plus most of the viruses that leak into the net are usually because of our clients. Now, to make things more interesting, I'm one of the guys who gets called in to clean viruses when we get infected in out normal company network.   If that wasn't enough, the PC next to me is connected to my company's network, where I can surf the net. So, now I have to get up, move away from my work and sit down in another PC so surf the net. You might think that what I should do is work and not surf the net, right? I ask you, how am I supposed to download drivers and patches or receive company emails if I don't have access to the net? Didn't think about that, huh? Well, its okay, neither did my boss.  But I'm not worried cause I disabled the internet on my coworkers PC's too. Why should I be the only one fucked? She said so herself. She doesn't want virus getting into the clients network. I'm just helping her out. ;)  Also, I installed Opera in the PC and hid every shortcut, reference to the program and pointer to the application. Heck, I even modified the uninstall name so nobody can find it in the Add/Remove Control Panel. So, now I'm the only one that has access to the internet through the client's network. Shhhhhhhhh !!! Don't tell anyone, ok?  Ain't I a stinker!  Sailor Ecchi
