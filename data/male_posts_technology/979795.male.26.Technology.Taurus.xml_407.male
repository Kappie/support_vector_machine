Turns out that they've just had a brush in with their form teacher. I'm not at liberty to post here what actually happened (and I'm sure what I had heard had been exaggerated to a certain extent too). Anyway, the girls were grumbling and mumbling for a good 20ish mins or so, even after we've told them to forget about the incident and start concentrating on lessons twice. It's not like I don't symphatise with what they were feeling but it was more of getting the lesson done instead. In the end, I had to give them a 'lecture on life' just to get them to quiet down.  Thinkit went along the lines of something like, "Hey girls! Why are you still grumbling?! I already told you to quiet down right?! Now, you want me to give you a lecture on 'Life' right? I tell you, when you start working outside in future, do you think your boss will not do the same thing (as what your teacher did)? What do you think you are going to do when he/she (does something similar or worse) than what (form teacher) did? QUIT!? Sure! You can do that. But what happens when you need the money/regular income? Then what are you going to do? Now, I'm not defending what (form teacher) did, neither is it up to me to judge whether she is right or wrong. If you feel like complaining, go ahead and do whatever you want later but right now I want everyone to settle down and start concentrating on the lesson." At least they quiet down right after. They weren't bad girls and most of them seemed highly intelligent as they seemed to put in more effort in their work then some of the classes of the same level. They can do good work when properly motivated. But they make too much noise. They tend to work AND talk at the same time and that makes the environment quite hard to work in sometimes.  When I think about what happened, I think their teachers must've had her own reasons for her actions. The girls can come in saying "She did this or that for no particular reason." And they can keep saying these for quite awhile. But most of the time, kids that age tend to only provide half a story. If you'd actually bothered talking to them even more for awhile longer, one would find that they will slowly change their sentence to "She did this or that for no particular reason.    But    we this or that before ..." Haiz ... keyword is the 'BUT', obviously people behave a certain way for a reason lah.  What I couldn't stand was that a huge no. of girls just left their books outside the lab and knowingly went home just like that. The last 2 girls whoe left the class had to clear up after them and they were quite pissed. Daphne and I allowed them to leave the stack of books in the lab till next morning, but I was quite pissed. Really. I told them to come at 8am to collect. I didn't want them to get into bigger trouble by complaining to their form teacher but I really intended to scold the girls good for leaving stuff around like that.When the morning came however the books were all gone. They must've collected before I came to work. Oh well, I don't have their names anymore and going to their teacher wouldn't benefit anyone. Forget it.   Siglap CC Aikido  Got to training later than usual. Freaking bus was single decked and FULL. Simply don't understand why SBS don't make svc 12 completely double deckered. I noticed that even when double deckered buses were full, they were still decently comfortable. Single deckered buses were HORRIBLE!! I had to pia down by cab and pay the extra surcharge. Argh ... $6.20 gone just like that. Leon and Wenjun were there just hanging around and waiting downstairs. I simply don't understand why they can't draw the keys to open the doors and start laying mats first instead of just slacking around. I went to draw keys and passed it to the 2 guys as I needed to go to the toilet first. Maybe because I was rushing to the CC, maybe because of my firm attitude with the students at work earlier, or maybe I was just plain pissed with the attitude I'm seeing in the dojo, but I wasn't in the mood to take crap today. Told them next time they were early, they should go draw out the keys instead of waiting around. Wenjun should know better. Leon, aiya ... expected lah.  Decided to change since I was already in the toilet. When I finished and went up to the dojo, the whole damn place was a mess. THe 2 guys just kept chucking mats on top of each other in such a messy pile instead near the entry point of when one carried the mats out. It slowly became a choking point. I asked them to start shifting the mats while I take out the mats from the room behind instead. Even so, they did things so slowly. Wenjun in particular even went to the extent of lying on the messy pile of mats instead of helping. WIth such an example to follow and slack around, Leon was quick to join in by just dilly dallying (on top of his usual habits) instead of helping properly. I just went about quickly to lay the mats with the help of the girls who soon arrived and Sakai who came even later. All the while, I was in a pissy mood so I just quietly laid the mats 1 row at a time as quick as I could.We soon finished laying but we haven't fitted them in yet.As wefitted the mats, I'm quite disgusted when I saw Wenjun, Leon, Cryssabella (oris it Isabella) all sitting behind talking and SMSing away. Roxanne wasn't around as she was changing in the toilet. I came across 2 mats wrongly laid and I actually asked Leon rather nicely (I can't believe myself either) to help me make a switch of the 2 mats (I even pointed out to him where to switch the mats). He saidOK rather nicely and came over to take the 2 mats away whileI went on fitting the amts. At this point, ONLY  Sakai and I were on the mats fitting them in (AARGHHHH!!^%*). When I came to the spot where I asked (keyword 'asked') Leon to exchange the mats, I only saw 2 lobang there. I turned around and saw that he had chuck the 2 mats in a corner and was standing behind talking happily to Wenjun. THAT WAS THE LAST (censored profanity) STRAW!!!! I remembered still really controlling my temper and just raising my voice and changing to a very irate tone "Wah lao eh, LEON! Don't leave the mats just lying there lah! When I asked you to change the mats, don't just do things halfway LAH!! Can you finish your work or not!!" I turned back looking REALLY pissed and by that time, the others were just a bit shocked because it was the first time any of them saw me come close to losing my temper. I went back to fitting the rest of the mats to cool myself down (which proved to be tremendously effective) and I didn't even notice whether anyone else chipped in after that. By the time the mats were finished, I was all smiley and comfortably relaxed again. Richard came in sometime later and signalled me to take the warmups. I decided to make the pace of the warmups a bit faster than usual just to get everyone going a little. But most of them still had the 'wanna-sleep' face. Richard did go around correcting Leon's posture and balance during warmup.  After awhile, Freddy Sensei arrived and he conducted the class again for the evening. He was more strict than usual and I think it was definitely necessary. I paired with Wenjun most of the night and found that he also has a slack attitude when it comes to training. But at least he tries and manages to observe better. Anyway, no further unpleasantness occurred for the rest of the night.
