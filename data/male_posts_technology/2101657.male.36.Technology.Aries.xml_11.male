Watching her edit the template and posting html code here, and typing some in by hand there, I can definitely say she knows her way around a web page. Shes only had a webpage since '96, when Geocities was the only real place offering a free web page. She was once a featured website, and there was only 1 of those at a time, once a month.  She does an  awesome  job with the sites, and is  amazing , to me, who works with  pc's , but not  html .  We got our popcorn today, for our CubScouts to deliver.  After unloading all of it, it was nice for a change that our sons only had a little amount to deliver.  Everything went pretty smoothly for the most part and kids maybe knocking on YOUR door to deliver something you ordered.  Everything we do as a CubScout Pack during the year is funded by what we earn from our popcorn sales.  Last spring we were able to purchase a new 2-lane all-aluminum 35ft long track.  Wow, is it awesome to run the derby on that! Our race night seemed to go by fairly quickly.  My assistant leader and I even set it up at another school for their CubScout Pack's derby. They haven't had one before, and we volunteered to help out, and it gave us an excuse to show off and use our new track.   We had 24 kids racing, using a double elimination, and we were done raceing in 45 minutes. Was amazing, our own pack races don't go that fast.   We're going to make a trip up to the University of Platteville Wisc tonight. They are having an Indian Pow wow.  This will be our second one this year, and our 3rd one total, together.  Should be quite interesting.  After going to the Tama Pow wow on August 7th, this one will be nicer, as it wont be boiling hot outside, and we'll understand it and appreciate it a little more as well.  The costumes are incredibly detailed, and the dancers are very good at what they do.  It's an awesome experience, one  I think everyone should experience for themselves.
