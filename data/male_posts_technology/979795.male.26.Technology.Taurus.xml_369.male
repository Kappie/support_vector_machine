In this dojo I'm able to functiona  little better because I really feel that every student there see each other as equals regardless of grade. It's good.  Well except maybe Leon. The kid is still young. Typical thing he does is not maintaining posture and having a slack training attitude. Even dojo discipline is qutie bad. But I think given his age, that's still understandable. I dun see him putting much effort when it comes to laying mats. Always comes early, but takes donkey time to put on his gi, and like to walk around the dojo while we lay mats. Ocasionally lays one or two pieces then stops to chit chat and tok kok. The two white belts, Ming Lee and Jeremy, at least lay mats while they chit chat. I like their beginner's attitude, open to learning no matter whether they can do the thing or not. They have no qualms about laying the mats themselves even. I had to suan Leon a bit that night. I said how come he's always walking around and when people lay ten mats he only lays one. Ar well, still young lah. I leave it to him.  Had a long tiring day today. Took 2 classes of Pri 2s this morning. After that there was a meeting with the HoDs of every subject. My manageress came down too. Basically a lot of discussion was done about how they wanted eLearning to go with regards to their dept. We got some really enthusiastic teachers in this school and also soem slack ones (naturally lah). Well, dun wanna comment too much but I didn't get to really rest till like after 3pm. By then I was starving coz I only had a drink of soya bean at 11+. Took some biscuits from Daphne and bought some mashed potato and bread from the canteen. Cheap lah.  Oh yea, some cute thing happened in school too. All the Pri 1s basically know who am I since I've already taken their class. I was popping in the library to look for my HoD when a bunch of Pri 1s who were there during their recess saw me. Here's what happened:  Me (Coming up to library): (To Librarian) Lathifa, did you see Tracey around? Lathifa: She was here just now. Me: Oh never mind then, maybe I'll come back later. Me: (Turns around and see bunch of kids jus behind me. Dun quite recognise them coz I've only met every class once so far.) ??... Kids: (Murmur murmur murmur...) 1 Kid: (Trying to recall my name) Ar ... mister ... ar mister ... ya Mr Tan. Me: Yes? Rest of kids: Ya ya ... it's Mr Tan. Me: Yes? Why? (as I tried making my way thru them towards the lib's exit). OK come let me pass first. Kids: (Crowd even closer. 1 girl to my left saw my hand just in front of her and just happily grab it.) Me: ???? ... yes? why? (While still making my way towards the Librarian and the door.)  I need to go meeting now OK? Me: (Amused) ... (walks over to Librarian and looks to her for help.) Lathifa: They like you lah. Me: Come, need to let go. Mr Tan needs to go for a meeting now OK? I'll come back later. Kid (with my hand): (Hugs hand around her neck and shakes her head. - Think the aircon was quite cold for the kids and my hand was like quite warm - I think that's why she didn't wanna let go lah.) Lathifa: OKOK, Mr Tan got meeting lah. Kids: (Start to disperse. Girl lets go of my hand also.)  Here's when the recess bell rang. (Saved by the bell.)  Me: OK... byebye (still feeling damn amused as I made my way back to the conference room). Kids: Byebyyyyyyye (while rushing around like ants).  Hahahaha ... cute hor.  Skipped training at Yuishinkai today because after the long schedule today I didn't feel mentally competent to be able to do anything besides dropping dead on my bed tonight. Tried my best to catch the documentary on National Geographic about Muay Thai. But seriously, was way to taxed to do so.  Shouwen (cousin) got his As today. B, C, D. Dunno for what subjects. His GP was a B3 I think. Anyway, the male cousins will be meeting for dinner at Suntec next Mon. Gonna be eating at my fren's place - Swiss Culture ... again. Haha ... can't help it lah, we like the food there.
