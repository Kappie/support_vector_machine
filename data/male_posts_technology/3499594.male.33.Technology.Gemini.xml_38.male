The individual that set it up basically wants to reaaaalllllyyy hand off the support to us (interface team). Guess who will be the person working mostly in it? Yep, yours truly. I am starting to feel like my hand is being in every part of this place. Oh well. To be fair, every team ( foundations, BOS, Orders, Interface, ect ) is feeling overwhelmed.   I was able to sit and eat with two of my peers. It was nice to just sit and chat. Sure most of it was about work, some frustrations. But I was able to get some personal information time to time. It was nice to get to actually know those I work with day to day. We ate at 'The Cheescake Factory' and I had a spicy cajun jumbali. It was good.  I guess, I will watch Edwards speech tonight.   I did manage to call the Election Board back in Oklahoma before it closed and found out that Tom Coburn, did win the Republican primary. I was a bit surprised, but pleased. So in November, it will be Tom Coburn against Brad Carson for Don Nickles seat. Nickles will not run again, so it will be important. There is also an Independant that will be on the ballot, but I don't see that happening.   My wife is thinking not to leave for Texas in the next weekend, not this coming. So we will see. I know I am still ready to get home, tonight and tomorrow night is left.  Sitting here eating a bit of my Dark Chocolate bar adn flipping the tv from Fox News to around the other channels. I am also rolling through the net.
