Just a high-level design. But I'm struggling for that itself. Coding, I can manage. But designing... its pretty tough work. But my PL is insisting on me thinking it out... In fact, I got more work... I need to prepare for a presentation on BizTalk' s response time that I was measuring over the past few weeks. Yet to get that started. And still some measuring needs to continue after we port everything to a 2 CPU server. That might take time. But as of now I'm doing some multi-tasking b'n ppt and designing...   boy... this designing stuff is taking the heck out of me...  Kicha
