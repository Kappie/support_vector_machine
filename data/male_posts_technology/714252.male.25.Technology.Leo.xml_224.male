Why is it that people think that just because they talk to me every now and again and maybe they have gone out for a drink with me on occasion they think that they know me?  I have situations in my life when people THINK they know me better than I know myself, when infact they don't actually know anything about me..  True Story: I was going out with this Girl. I was in love and was very happy. One night I am out with a mutual friend of ours in RiRa. we are sitting upstairs having a chat when this DROP DEAD blonde from the Netherlands comes up to me and says "Hi, What's your name?" I introduce myself and say hi, she then asks me straight out have I got a girlfriend.. I'm a bit surprised but I say yeah I do and she says "That's a pity, I'd love to go downstairs and fuck you in the toilets." My friends jaw drops, he is sitting behind her and he starts frantically signalling to me to go. He very clearly lets me know that there is no way my GF will ever find out from him and that it's ok, he understands. What he doesn't realise is that I really REALLY don't want to be unfaithful to this girl because she means that much to me. Hell yeah it was tempting, who wouldn't have been tempted but I left it. Three more times she came over to me that night and every time I said no..  So said, when I am single?  True Story: I was seeing this girl. Had been out with her a few times but it was nothing serious. Met up with her and we went to Ri-Ra. What's the first thing I see walking in the door? another girl I am seeing.. You see my dilemma.. I go over, kiss the other girl on the cheek, ask her were she is sitting and when I find out she is upstairs I tell her I'm here with friends and I'll be in to her in a minute. Go downstairs and position Bubbles with the girl downstairs, bring Jonny upstairs and leave him with the other girl and I proceed to bounce between the two all night.. I know that is pretty bold to say the least but I wasn't in a relationship with either of them and they knew it. I just didn't want to rub the fact I was seeing someone else in their faces.. The really funny part of this story (hmmm.. Funny is the wrong word but I haven't found the right word yet) is that I actually left that night with a third girl who turned into my Italian stalker (yes I have had a stalker.. cool eh?)  There we go. Two true stories from my life that sound like two completely different people. What do we learn about me from this? I have no fucking clue.. The point I am trying to get across is that while I can be a complete slut it is only when I have every right to be. When I am committed to someone. REALLY committed then I am completely faithful and honest with that person. Anyone I have gone out with knows every one of my dirty secrets and stories. They know I have been in threesomes and mini orgies, they know I have gone out with twins one after the other. They know I have stolen my best friends girlfriend only to realise it was the fact that she was the worst person for me to go out with that attracted me to her. They all know this about me and know that I will never betray them because the upside of my behaviour in the past is that I have learned from my mistakes.  Another Example: Elvis\Richard I don’t even know where to begin.. I still have a nice little pit of anger in my stomach and believe me it takes a LOT to make me angry. You have to really work hard to get me worked up.. I think the thing that pissed me off the most about what he said was when he said that if I have a problem with him I should have brought it to him privately.. I had no problem with him at all yet he decides to ignore his own advice and try to “trap me” online. Again this is hilarious because the actions themselves don’t bother me at all.. What bothers me is his reason for them. That and him bringing my private annoyance at what was going on in Salsa into the public domain.  Which reminds me. WHO THE FUCK TOLD ELVIS ABOUT MY PRIVATE LIFE? I WILL FUCKING TEAR YOUR HEAD OFF AND SHIT DOWN YOUR NECK TILL YOU SUFFOCATE!  Actually I won’t but please please please, never talk about my private life to someone who you don’t know for a fact I would talk to myself. My private life is my own and while I have no secrets from my friends I have no wish to have my secrets told to people I don’t know can keep them. Basic rule is if it’s not on my blog I don’t want it told..  I’m still mad and I want to rant more but I think I’ll leave it.. Already up to two pages in word..  Grrrr
