Anyhow, I'm in the middle of my summer vacation, which really isn't, but that's what it's called. I've gotten hired to do some work for the local school, which will provide me with enough entertainment to fill the empty spots in between the two lab-courses I'm doing during the summer. Not to mention the exam scheduled for August, which I only found out about today. Ah well, them's the breaks.  So, without further ado, off I go to spend the last free time I've got until school starts again...after which I will have even less...oh God, I'm starting to sound bitter.
