One is a screenplay about a 30-something divorced guy who decides to drive cross country after a nasty divorce and a dead-end job.   Here's just a taste:  David: (V.O.)  It was never my intention to be snorting lines of blow off a Mexican stripper’s chest.  That wasn’t the reason for my trip – just a nice little ancillary benefit. If my wife could see me now. But then again, she is the reason I’m here right? Fuck her.    More on that later.   I'm also putting together a proposal/pitch to WGBH on a jazz documentary that will focus on one of Boston's oldest jazz clubs - Wally's. They have live jazz 365 days a year there with some of the youngest up and coming acts fresh from Berklee Music School. If anyone has any ideas on this please let me know. lsdk;j It's intended on being a new look into the jazz community in the 21st century and it's parallels with the 40s/50s/60s.   More on that later as well...
