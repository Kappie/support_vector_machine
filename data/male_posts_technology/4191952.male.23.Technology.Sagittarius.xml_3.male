Lets go in and set things on fire,” popped into their little heads…more or less they set a few small fires, used the fire extinguisher in over abundance to put them out, and drove a forklift backwards through a garage door. To their defense, they claim the forklift was in reverse and they never tried to damage anything. We found this out right after going to have some film developed and getting some Mexican grub at Lupes.   The problem is that he never told the Sheriff about this and there was a mystery film someone had proving what he did…along with my girlfriend and his girlfriend, we went to the dude’s house and more or less scared his little prepubescent brain into a sort of shock. His pupils grew to the size of grapes and he became pale white. Ok, one fire down, literally since he burned the tape, and several to go…well, his mom took him to confess this to the Sheriff, only thing, the Sheriff isn’t in till tomorrow. So he got to wait all night and some of the morning to go tell of this misadventure. In all of this, the owner and his son of the place and vandalization was cool about it…he said since he gave them permission to skate there, he can’t say much. He’d leave it unlocked for them at times and has since sold the place…so water under the bridge.  All in all a huge forest fire was put out.   My problem with this came when two of the boys decided to come over and mouth at the people having to work on our Aunt’s house. They had worked that morning and in some sick rewarding system, they were able to go wake boarding…yep, cause 15G’s of damage, work one morning, and get rewarded…something isn’t right here…The father of one of the kids was working on the house and was reaming my girlfriend’s brother the whole time, but says nothing to his son when the little fucker mouths off at him, mouths off at me and my girlfriend’s brother. After a few times of me throwing Ice Tea on the boy’s vehicle and scaring the piss out of them…I decide to take a break and leave for awhile…  We get back around 10pm and the boys were at my girlfriend’s house…I didn’t even want to look at them so I went to change. Apparently the one who mouthed earlier went as far as saying he was going to “get all up in my face and kick my ass.” I was in no mood, kidding or not kidding to deal with it. So after making amends with the one I threw the tea at…I told him to tell his buddy to quit mouthing…that is all, 100% truthfully folks.  We get a call about 30 minutes later from the boy’s mom…now remember what I said and take into consideration that I’m 23, and he’s 16. I’m not going to touch him unless he’s doing something less than shooting at me. I’m not going to jail with him…also that he has a mouth that’s had several older people, 18+ in age, want to tear him apart…I got to argue with his mom about me supposedly beating him up, making it strange when he comes over, yadda-yadda-yadda.  I was so close to telling her to go have anal intercourse with herself I was shacking…then at midnight, they come over and we have to “talk” about it. He sits there with this hurt little “whoa as me” look on his face while his mom shields him from the world.  I have a secret for her…with him being such a smartass, and having only a home schooled learning level of about 4th grade…there’s a chance that he’s going to be exactly what he is his whole life…the next time some big, bad 18 year old is after him, I won’t be at his house at 11pm to play bouncer…I’ll be home sipping some scotch and giggling at some Family Guy.  It’s sad I don’t have all of this taped for your enjoyment…it made little to no sense to me at all. “Let’s make Hunter the bad guy.” I was packed up and ready to happily go home…far be it for me to be at my girlfriend’s mom’s house to see her and make it awkward for that poor little shit.  I’m angry to the point that it’s hard to explain, it’s like when you want to hit something, but still alert enough to not want to damage anything of yours. Maybe I’ll go to my co-worker’s desk and kick some stuff around…  To top it all off…hold on, I’m almost done…my girlfriend’s mom was snoring so loud, it woke me up around 11:30…after going to bed around 11:00…and I had to go to the living room to get some rest…this was after my girlfriend in her sleepy slumber mouthed at me, then when I came back to the room after a dose from 1am-6am, I get in bed, snuggle some, then get an itch…obviously this was a bad thing and it shook the bed more than to my baby’s liking, the asked me what that was, then flopped back over in blatant dislike. I popped back with, “I guess I’ll not scratch my leg anymore…(almost said princess at the end of that.) She replied with “Why do you always do that? I stayed quiet, sometimes that’s better. I didn’t get a very warm kiss goodbye for work this morning, so I’m a little tired and missing that extra hour of snuggling with my sweetheart.   I had to be into work at 7am for 4 days this week and then get a 3 day weekend…four 10 hour days…7am-6pm.   I’m tired…I need some coffee and a nap…today is going to be long and I’m not sure if I’ll make it…
