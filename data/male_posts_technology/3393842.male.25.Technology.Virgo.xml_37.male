Every single time I read it.. every single time I read it like its the first time. Is that because each time the content is appealling and gets forgottnen then and there ? I would love to beleive that each time I read it, creates a small change in perspective about something still left unlearnt.  On the book now, somehow the part of the book where Jonathan himself learns was what I used to find interesting. The parts where Fletcher et al., are taught was slightly on the lesser side. WAS, 'cos now when I read it. This is the part that appears to be the most interesting. Quite a small book what you find in  urlLink this link  is the entire book with a few typos here and there.  Have fun reading folks !!
