I was the only person between the age group of 12 to 35. This in a church that is over 200 people. It's quite sad.    Letters to the Editor   From yesterday's Herald:-  Palestine caught in a corner  Palestinian threats of retaliation against the killing of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin are empty and hollow. It's not that I think the Palestinians won't kill more people. They've already got a written declaration of war that demands the destruction of Israel and the annihilation of Jews everywhere, so what have they got left to threaten?  If Israel had not killed Yassin, Palestinians would definitely have killed more people. So what has Israel got to lose?  This has nothing to do with whether you support Israel, Palestine or neither. The Palestinians have boxed themselves into a corner where any further threats mean nothing.  Leonard Bloksberg, Remuera   And my comment: Indeed.   Young musicians amaze  In a packed Auckland Town Hall we attended the Young Musician of the Year Grand Final. Fourth row from the front, we were surrounded by TV cameras all focused on three amazing young soloists, two violinists and a cellist.  Kate Hawkesby introduced the judges and said that if we, the audience, "lobbied hard enough" then the performances might be shown on TV One. Why should we have to lobby? It was amazing and deserved a direct broadcast.  Why do the arts still take a back seat to sport? Why do we have so much focus on NZ Idol when these musicians have been honing their craft for years?  Even viewers not interested in classical music would have been mesmerized by these performances. My two young students from Papatoetoe Intermediated were.  Dora Whitlock, Remuera    And again I say: Indeed. More on this later.
