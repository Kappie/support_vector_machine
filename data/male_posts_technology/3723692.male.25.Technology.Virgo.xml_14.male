So  urlLink Silent spring  departs. We twice had phone conversations today. He wasn’t happy how the things went about with his mom today., I just hope before leaving it was all patched up. He did sound as if he doesn’t want to come back, but I know he will. His family means a lot to him. I have suggested him to go for MS. He should do MS in film making etc etc. He is hell of a talented bloke.   Awais my  urlLink GIKI  buddy called from Paris today, he is there for a course and damn he is having fun in roller coasters and joy rides of Disney ;). He is a shy guy so there is no possibility of beach ventures * grin*. I wish him all the best for the course I know inshAllah he will do great. Tomorrow I will be attending play by Black Fish, you can read all about them in their community on  urlLink orkut . I am hoping for a good time. Till then  Adios  PS: whats wrong with my sidebar(its more of a footer now) I think its either the post size or number of posts, any idea anyone?
