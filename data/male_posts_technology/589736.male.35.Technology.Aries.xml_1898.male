They said that Al Gore was a centrist Democrat and that Dean was much further left of him.  Do you agree with this?  If so, I am terrified to think that Dean might win the White House, as I have always considered Gore to be a fringe left wing loonie.  If Dean truly is left of Gore....  On a funny note, Dean is aparently raising most of his money via the internet.  If that is the case, he owes Al Gore two thank yous.  First for the endorsement.  But most importantly for the internet, because we all know that Al Gore invented the internet.
