     

      The waters choppy, but it doesn't cut me, no 

'Cause I ain't sinkin', no I ain't goin down below 

I don't think that way, you know I never have 

Well I cant slow down now just because you lag  



You're always pulling, keep on trying to bring me down 

I'm going to show you that I don't like to fuck around 

You show your face and I'll look the other way 

You blink your eyes and you've got no friends to play  



Pick up the slack 

I won't carry your monkey on my back 

Save the world 

Got no time, I've got to save myself today  



I've got a mission to fulfill the things in life 

I've got a lot of things to see before I live to die 

All this negativity tries to bring me down 

As you get worse, I turn my life around
