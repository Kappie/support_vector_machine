I've searched the net for some pictures and studios, but none of what i found really pleased me except for one tattoo, it is a  urlLink portrait of the legendary Bruce Lee (click me) . I al urlLink so found a poster of him, Bruce Lee High Kick (click me),  and i really liked it. It so powerful and the colors are so simple yet very distinguish. I'm not a big fan of arts and so; but i like what i like. Anyway, i guess i'll have to decide between these two pictures.
