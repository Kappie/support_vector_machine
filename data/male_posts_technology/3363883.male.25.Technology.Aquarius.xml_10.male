I'm supposed to have a friend, Wako, up this weekend from London but I haven't heard anything yet.  I haven't organised anything to do when he's up there which probably means we're going to get excessively battered and have a kebab somewhere.  Tonight however is something that I'm definately looking forward to.  England play Portugal in the first quaterfinal of the Euro Cup.  It's a shame that we play the Host first.  I don't think they have as good a chance as England does to win.  Either way, it's a good excuse for a barbeque and a beer. It's a bit blowy outside but the sky is blue and I wouldn't be doing my country proud unless I was searing some flesh somehow.  My house has also managed to pick up a projector from work.  I use the term "pick up" very loosely.  Actually, it's probably a very good description as that's exactly what we did .. .. .. .. .. .. just while no-one else was looking.  So we will be watching the football on a screen larger than most pubs in oxfordshire are offering.   Excellent.  I've asked that if I get a bit too tired and emotional [read "pissed out of my brain"], to please drag me in front of the screen so I don't actually miss out on anything.  So what else has happened?  The Good news: We Won the Lotto  The Bad news: We only Won a tenner  The Good news: No one actually got the jackpot  The Bad news:  Our chance of ever winning the jackpot are zilch  The Good News: With a tenners worth of tickets bought extra, we have ten times the chance.  The Bad News: .. .. .. Can I have my frogurt now?    [If you've never watched a Simpson Halloween special, this might have gone over you a little.]
