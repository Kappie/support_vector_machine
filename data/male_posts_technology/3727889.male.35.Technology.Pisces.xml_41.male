I start with the easiest search that could possibly come up, SirFWALGMan. Zing. Several Hits. Ok, so there just links to posts I have made on 2+2, Sloe and the Fat Guy.. but what the hell. At least it came up!  Let's try MSN and see what happens there. Pretty much the same thing. Same sites. Maybe a few less. Ok. Not so promising yet. Then I go to Yahoo! the best of the Search Engines -- and there it is "Online Poker Thoughts" the SirFWALGMan site! Number one baby! When all of those surfers out there do a search for FWALGMan there going to get me! Ya Baby! I can see the Amazon royalties coming in.  Rising high like I just his quads in a huge pot, I decide to try a more robust search sentence. "Online Poker Thoughts". I mean someone *MIGHT* type that in a search engine, right? BAM! Number one again! Woo Hoo! I am doing so well. I can bet anything now.  Obviously, here comes the tilt. I try a search for "Online Poker Blog". So Im like 10 pages in, still no Sir.. well .. maybe 20? Nope. 100? Ok, I am not THAT pathetic. Anyway, nice to see my Blog come up somewhere in the world.
