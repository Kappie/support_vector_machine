I intend to replicate this library locally. I hope they dont mind.  The quality of the recording is bad, but not a hindrance to learn.  This is a vocabulary an  improvement attempt. At times it is necessary to improve vocabulary to communicate with (and get doubts answered from) people who understand the Jargon.
