After we went back to Rob and Stacee's house where Karissa played with the kids and we had dinner.    I made mini-kolache's and Rob fried up some hamburgers. Kim and Stacee filled water balloons for the kids for after dinner. When it came time for water balloons the balloons went quick. The deck was wet and the kids discovered that water and sidewalk chalk make paint so they painted each other. After some time doing that they decided they wanted to get into the hot tub.    I stepped in for my part in the kid washer assembly line and we cleaned all kids before allowing them in the hot tub. Once they gotinto the hot tub we added some dish soap to the tub. Well the tub was full of bubbles in no time. Karissa dove into the water and came up covered in bubbles. She wiped her eyes of and started laughing and basically looked like a mini-Santa or something.    Kim tookthis pic with her camera phonewe all thought it was pretty darn funny so I have put it up here for all to see!         After that the kids stayed up late playing until I put Karissa in the car and headed home. She was out cold in about 10 minutes. She said she had a really great time and even wanted to call and tell everyone so I let her.    Now it is daddy's bedtime as he is pretty tired himself.
