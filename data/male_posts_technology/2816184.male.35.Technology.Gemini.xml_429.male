She doesn't really care about him any more and it worries me.  Not to mention the fact that she's threatened to do herself and him a damage a few times.  Scary.  The one bright spot in this, however, is that the mrs. is now much better inclined toward Her, which is nice.  At least I can mention Her without raising a load of ire.  In fact She will even be comming to my son's first birthday, which should be a fairly surreal experience all around.  Migraine comming on, won't blather any longer....  Love life?  Call it 7 or so, thanks....
