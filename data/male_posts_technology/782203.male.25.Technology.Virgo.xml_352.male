But it still seems so strange not talking to her every night like we used to.  Ok almost every night. Really miss talking to her.  BTW if you wanna make a call overseas sign up with  urlLink Sunpage  , it's only 3 cents a minute for overseas calls to a fixed line number (calls to a mobile phone is much more expensive) . And it's free subscription and registration so you have no extra costs.   I spend the whole afternoon rushing to finish this task that's due on Tuesday.  Man I really really hate to do work on a weekend, sometimes I wish I had a job where once you finish your workday you can go back home and not worry about it anymore. A job like an air stewardess for example.   Ok the Man Utd vs Arse match coming up in 10 minutes. I'm outta here.
