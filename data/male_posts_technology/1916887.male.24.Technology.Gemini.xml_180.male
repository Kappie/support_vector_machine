It can be done in "Display Properties" Panel - "Settings" Tab - "Advanced..." Button - "Troubleshooting" Tab - "Harware Acceleration" Tab set to "None". This makes a BIG difference, especially over LAN connections and even with others VNC distributions.WARNING: Turning off hardware acceleration with some ATI cards with result in BSODs under windows 2000. When you can turn it off however, the results are impressive. WARNING: This trick is pointless if the Video Hook Driver (W2000/XP) is used on the server.   Seriously, this tip works great.  I am dead-heading a test machine and I was finding the refresh to be extremely sluggish.  Now it seems quicker than if I was sitting at the machine itself!  Also, today's Black Tuesday (MS patch day).  They don't have the patches up on Technet yet, but expect some Direct X issues.. (rss is good).
