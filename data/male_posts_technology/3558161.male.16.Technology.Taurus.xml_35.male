They are the things you get ashamed of, becuase words diminish them--words shrink things that seemed limitless when they were in your head to no more than living size when they're brought out. But it's more than that, isn't it? The most important things lie too close to wherever your secret heart is buried, like landmarks to a treasure your enemies would love to steal away. And you may make revelations that cost you dearly only to have people look at you in a funny way, not understanding what you've said at all, or why you thought it was so important that you almost cried while you were saying it. That's the worst, I think. When the secret stays locked within not for want of a teller but for want of an understanding ear.  I've made the brutal mistake of investing all of myself into something that has decided to not work out for myself. I've learned my lesson, tenfold.   I suppose all that's left to say is that there's plenty more fish in the sea.
