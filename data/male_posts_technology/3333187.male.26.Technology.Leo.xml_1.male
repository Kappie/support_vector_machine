Try getting something done and try to get them to understand is like hitting your head off a very danse brick wall....  If I have a gun I wouldn't waste the shot on those useless Fuckers!! I'd turn it on my self and end the relentless time wasting they put me trough.. Trying to torturing these dumb shit is pointless as well because they are too thick to realize PAIN!!!!!!!  BURN IN HELL MOTHER-FUCKER.     so much for the nice post I was going for today.  What a fucking week. I would like to say the day off on Tuesday was relaxing but that a Lie. Send the car for a much over due service. Get told that "should be ready after lunch. Sent it in to card Dealer in Sandford at around 11 o'clock, so decide that it a nice day to walk down to Stillorgan. Got some Eddie Rockets and felt good.... HA! Here where the real fun starts, it is now 1 o'clock or there about and figure to walk back from Stillorga to the garage as car maybe ready. So get a phone call (first of many) on the way back and tell me they my brake pads are shot and will be 97EUROS to replace. Ho well yes. Now told that should be ready at around 3 o'clock. SHHHHYYYY!. So I then continue to walk back to Sandyford, get a brainstorm "Lest go see the Luas". Got to say very nice. Best think is there are not in-service yet and they are already starting to block up traffic. I watch for about 10 minuets and see the train go up and down the track with "The Lads" sitting in the train drinking Tae and greatly relaxing. Tax EUROS at work here people!  Back to me... I tier of watching Larry and the Lads using the Luas as Giant Scalelectrics set and walk off the explore the sight and smell of Sandford Industrial Estate. Get yet an other brainstorm. "go to Bewelys Hotel" as it is just un in LeopardsTowns. Sitting patently waiting for 3o'clock to come along. No sooner did the clock turn 3 and another Phone call... "eh! yeah we seam to have a leak in the gear box", "can fix to leak on the outside but will cause another 279EUROS if for us to open the gear box and repair the "possible leak". Said NO!!! Now have to wait till 5 o'clockl to get. "Waitress an other coffee here and complementary Newspaper".   After read the paper (I think that was the first time kin My life I ever read the dam thing trough out) and many Coffee's and trips to the bathroom it was time to depart to the Garage. Get there at 5:10 get car 6 o'clock... And it does not end here..  I Take the car home and can her a very strange noise from the gearbox. Thing nothing of it and pack the card for the night. Driving the car to work the next day, the clunking noise is now louder and followed up with a very high pitch squeaking noise. Yep I'm thing there's something not quite right!! The car struggles to get to the office. Got to take it back to the Garage, again.  So if I have to take back might as well get off work early to do so. Half day WAHOO! Not really I'm thinking that another 4 hours waiting around for my car. Thankfully not drop the car in explained the situation . Took a look at it and come back 20 minuets later saying."eh! sorry there was something loose in the engine". JOY!!!  So a week of shit in work and forking out 408EUROS on the car. God can't wait for the Weekend.
