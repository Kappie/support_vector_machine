Expected Results:   Save money on gas, at least enough to off set the price of the gym membership.  Will save money on electricity; taking a shower at the gym saves hot water produced by my water heater, the most inefficient device ever created.  Will not be tempted to smoke in the car on the way to work, i.e. I will not be in the car, but on a bicycle.  Will be unfat.   Drawbacks:   While making sure that the gym provided individual shower stalls, that does not guarantee that you will be totally shielded from the naked people.  8:30 in the morning is way too early, rather it is always way too early to be in the same room with a naked man, much less engage in conversation with one.  One must get up early to ride to ones bike a particular distance.  When one over sleeps, one is unable to ride ones bike to work in timely order.  One is however, while sitting in traffic, able to see an old lady that looked like Lou Reed.  Had one been responsible, one may have missed out on this anomaly.
