I told Amy about my Doctor's visit so she adjusted today's ab and leg workout to not put so much stress on the knee.

Back of the knee and the hamstring were ablaze while I tried to keep my heals on the ball as I pulled it in. Amy tells me in time I can move my hands in to work the abs but for now their out reaching as far as I can in an attempt to keep the ball centered.  My hamstring cramped up into the bike so I opted to stop. I'll take John for a walk to make up for the lost time if it doesn't rain.
