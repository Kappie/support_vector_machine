When Sleep is Fleeting    Nothing can describe The way I feel at night A time of cold and darkness But warmed beyond belief By thoughts of you. Thoughts of letters written and paths traveled... prayers said... hopeful hearts. The night becomes a somewhat happy place Where my mind wanders onto happy things. Leaving the problems of the day To meet the bliss, that is meeting you. And when I wake I wonder If it will all turn out this way And again I pray That it will be. But I thank God either way... Here for a moment or here to stay, I thank him for what he's done In bringing us to meet this way.
