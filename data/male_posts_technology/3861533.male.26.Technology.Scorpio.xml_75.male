The book starts shortly after  urlLink The Hope  ended (see  urlLink previous post ) and ends in 1988 with the 40-year celebration of Israel's independence. The story of the fictional main characters continue; they are older and their children become grown-ups as well. As in the first book, historical characters of that time period interact with the main characters: Moshe Dayan, Golda Meir, Yitzak Rabin and Anwar Sadat to name those that I recognise.  Once again, since the viewpoint is that of it's main characters, who are all Israeli, "the other side" is only seen through their eyes.   From an historical point of view there are two omissions I find irritating. First, Wouk barely just mentions the War of Lebanon. Secondly, ending in 1988, the intifadah (begun in december 1987), is mentioned mostly a nuisance (again from the perspective of the characters) in that it drove away tourists from the celebration of Independence.  -->
       Finished re-reading  urlLink The Glory by Herman Wouk  yesterday. I've read it once before, over four years ago.
