There was a great dinner, an open bar, a live band, and lots of socializing, at one of the best  urlLink restaurants  in DC.  Very fun.  It was really a great time for a job well done, the execs really pulled out all the strings to throw this gala event.  They really did a nice job. My friend CW came too, even though he left the company a few months ago, he was invited, because he was a contributor to our successes.  It was great to catch up with him, and we continued the conversation we had started during his final days as an employee.  We talked about a decision point, The Passion movie, and differences in religions.  The most significant thing we talked about, certainly, was my story of the P strategy, and thinking about him and giving him that book.  How Joe pressed him for what book, and then hearing that Joe had gotten the same book as a gift the next day.  CW said that he didn't think it was a coincidence at all, I of course agree.  He and his fam also went to a church a few weeks ago, and they liked it.  It sounded a lot like Grace.  Your prayers for CW and his continuing to investigate and research would be great news.
