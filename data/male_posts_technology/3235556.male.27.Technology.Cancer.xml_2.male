We have over 1800 servers of mixed breed of course, SUN, HP Compaq, and DELL.  And we have about 28 mainframes, each of which supporting a variety of businesses.  Enough of the smalltalk.  Today it seemed that everything that could go wrong, did.  I dunno, we must have some environmental issues or something, because it seems that tons of hardware failed.  Most likely users breaking their systems as usual.  As they say in the IT world, the user is the most dangerous part of a computer system.  If it aint bad enough that the hardware is failing, we at the command center are the middleman and have to contact the users of these systems and coordinate downtimes and stuff to replace hardware.  Gosh, these guys are dense, they want things done yesterday, but their managers won't front the bill for vendor support contracts for these systems. On top of all this, we gotta deal with this stuff for 12 hours, many times not even a break....ehhhhhhh
