In Mos Eisely, we see Obi-Wan discussing with Chewbacca (no dialogue heard, Chewie just nods); a few moments later, Obi-Wan introduces Chewbacca to Luke as "Chewbacca here is first mate on a ship that might suit us."  They could certainly have met before, possibly as pilot and paying passenger.  It would push the irony angle a bit much for me if Chewie had met Annakin before, and thus served as co-pilot for his son on the way to the Death Star.  But then, Darth Vader made Threepio, so what the hell.
