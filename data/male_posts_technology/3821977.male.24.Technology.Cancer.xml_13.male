He rushed the ending and just finished it with 3 pages of end writing. I'm not sure whether to read Terminal Man or Great Train Robbery. In regards to Alex's comment on my prior post. The mustard was purely an accident. haha Alex you can have this book after i'm done reading it. It doesnt have the same snazzy book cover as the original stained paperback but It should do just fine.  Charlene got a job at Conns as a cashier. She's working 40 hours a week. Very good news as we will have quite abit of money now extra. She also receives a super discount there. I am working overtime on Sunday and on Friday i'm going to fix some guy's computer @ 60 an hour. This should be a very nice month indeed.   peace rob
