But oh well we learn to be patient when we are kids and some things never change in the world I guess.   SO the job for Huntington still hasn't been posted. I don't know when it will be. Things are going to get strange and weird all over here if that doesn't get done soon. I will have to do a lot of stuff before I leave if do. I said I would replace the carpet in my room with hard wood because of the stains on the floor from when erein was still being potty trained and I wanted it for my self. Ohh well i will deal with that when i get to it.
