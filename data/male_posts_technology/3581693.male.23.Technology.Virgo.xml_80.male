Now I can't say that I came to be this way all on my own - oh no no no - you see, I come from a long line of excellent males who know how to blow their own horn - and rightfully so - in most cases. So I must say, I'm extremely fortunate to have been born into this family. That in mind - let me begin.   So I've been going to the gym now for a little over 8 months - and boy am I ever impressed with the results. Especially recently, I started doing a routine - focusing on certain parts of the body each time I go. Let me tell ya - this is contagious - I can't get enough of it. Well ladies and gentlemen - especially ladies - in about a month - my new nick name will be Shaunicus Maximus - God of Surrey and surrounding areas.  Anyways - me sleepy - I'll discuss egos further at a later date...  ... Lately, however, I've noticed that I have become a bit of an introvert. WHAT? Shaun is an introvert... this shouldn't come as any surprise - there have been comments dating as far back as grade 3 about Shaun being shy - thanks Jamie Fraser. So how can someone who is so shy and introverted have much of an ego - no one really knows. So do I have a huge ego? Maybe not huge - there's always room for expansion.   So that's what I'm going to do - EXPAND! - after all, I do have a lot to brag about. I think that if I start working with my ego in everyday situations I will become more successful. Friends and coworkers will enjoy being around me, women will fall head over heals for me - I truly will have it all! As one of my good friends put it - you need 3 things to be successful - Money, Attitude and Muscles - The MAM effect.   By nature, I am a cheap bastard - so this should help take care of the money issue - once I learn how to spend it of course. Muscles - as afore mentioned - gimme a month or two and I'll be trim, cut and ready to go! And that leaves attitude - I do need to work on this. Let me think - my introvertedness has caused me to focus a lot of my energy on inner thoughts - I tend to keep them to myself - and never act on impulses. Now I could go from one extreme to another here and act on every impulse I have - but that would leave me slightly unprotected. Of course - if that is my only fear - being unprotected - then maybe going to the extreme is what I need to do.  My way of conversing has become too reactive. I need to take initiative and become the person people think I am (upon first sight) - and start conversations. I have nothing to be shy about. So anyways... all that's left to do now is get started...
