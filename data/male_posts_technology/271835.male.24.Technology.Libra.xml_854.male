Don't worry though as this only applies to web weasels "If you are an employee, partner, affiliate or legal representative of any site which enforces compulsory user registration then we require you to complete our registration process. It costs nothing to register and will only take a moment." The form required is pretty big (although I have seen actual registration forms even bigger than that) and the questions are fairly silly. Revenge is sweet! ;)  BugMeNot are also asking non registration sites to add the following to their TOS: Any subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, or employees of any site employing compulsory user registration mechanisms are not authorized to access the content or services of this site. which would effectively make it illegal for say NY Times reporters to use the web if everybody did it. New Links may well have a one paragraph TOS in place tonight!  More on BugMeNot  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .
