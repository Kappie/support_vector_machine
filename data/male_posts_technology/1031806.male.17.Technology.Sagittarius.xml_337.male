I was leaving my friend's house which happens to be four houses down from Mr. Olesen (my IT team leader)'s house and he started pulling out of his driveway. I passed him and a couple streets down he pulled alongside me because I was turning left and he was going straight. I waved at him but he didn't seem to recognize me and it was our turn to go, so I turned and continued on my way thinking I'd ask him at our next meeting if he realized later who it was. A tiny bit later, I turned left again onto TV Highway and started cruising in the left lane, when who should pull up alongside me, but... Mr. Olesen (lol) He motioned for me to pull over to the side of the road and started to do so himself so I followed suit by putting my turn signal on and starting to switch to his lane so I could get off onto the shoulder. Right at that moment some idiot it a raised pickup decided to gun it and swerve around him before he was even out of his lane, in the process cut off the person behind me and nearly collided with me. I swerved back into my lane as he roared past then signaled and finally got off onto the shoulder. Mr. Olesen saw the entire thing and had to drive up to meet me since I was a significant ways down the road after that idiot cut me off. The reason for all this was that he had loaned me a key to a storage unit that we were storing a ton of PCs in and needed it back - when he saw me he thought he'd come flag me down but "didn't anticipate almost getting me into a wreck" LOL
