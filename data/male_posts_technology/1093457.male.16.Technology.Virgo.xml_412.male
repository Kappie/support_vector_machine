I got up about 9am this morning and pottered around for 3 hours, then decided to clear out my room, seeings as I have a huuuge amount of junk stashed away.I started with under my bed, where I foudn a ridiculour number of plastic carrier bags and loads of old chritsmas cards, then I moved onto my desk which contained thousands of unwanted, unloved, unused pens, which promptly went in the bin. NOw if you come into my room you can see the carpet, and it is possible to find what you want in my desk, which is quite an achievement. I also got round to changing the sheets and vacumink all the dust of the paintwork, and then I did an hour's revision before lunch and Neighbours! Since then I have been reivising/chatting on messenger, cos the weather is so foul I can't really be bothered to do anything properly at the moment. I've got to go out before 4pm to be at school for our first Austria rehersal, which I am so not looking forward to. If I get stuck in the front row I will scream, I really will! Also, Mrs Hicks reckons we need a bass guitar for a couple fo songs, so I dread to think what she's got in store for us, probably a shed load of stupid gospel songs that require singing stupid words and waving our arms around like loonies, cos that's what we usually end up doing. Only this year we've got Mrs Kent too, who altough she is nicer than Mrs Hicks, she picks out the most ridiculous songs for her choirs to sing.  Oh well, the joys of music. Even though my street cred is going ot be ruined after this, at least I'm leaving you lot here!  Must go finished some revision before I have to go and suffer torture, toodle pip guys!
