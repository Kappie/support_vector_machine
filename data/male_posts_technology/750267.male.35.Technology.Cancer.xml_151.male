And think of it, that's not what the U.S. government SPENDS in a month, it's what they BORROW in a month. What could I do with $75.6 billion?  Well, for one, I would be the richest person in the world, more than doubling the wealth of Bill Gates who only has $33.4 billion.  I could purchase PepsiCo, who's current market value is $66.2 billion.  I could give every man, woman and child in the United States $259.11.  I could give every man, woman and child in the World $11.99 (which is a lot of money in some countries).  I could purchase 44 space shuttles (at $1.7 billion a piece).  And that's just with one month's worth of the U.S. government debt.
