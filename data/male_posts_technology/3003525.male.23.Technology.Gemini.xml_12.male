The only problem is that the script doesn't implement RSS properly (he doesn't use the perl modules), and does not escape html tags and such. So, when I try to process the script, it gets hung up (pretty lame).  My thought was that I'd use the  urlLink Blogger.com API  to re-post everything from my LJ over to my blog, which would be super rad. The problem is that the Blogger.com API is really out-dated, and scantily implemented, and doesn't allow me to back-date posts like you can through the blogger web-interface. BONER.   ah well. I'll figure something else out, I suppose.   Pretty soon, I'll be going over to my buddy,  urlLink George 's place for a BBQ. It'll be tastey, I hope. Hopefully it doesn't rain.
