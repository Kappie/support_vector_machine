I found it at the "gentle joseki" series at  urlLink gobase.org   And I recommend this "http://gobase.org/information/history/china" if you are interested in learning the origins of go   and here is the short story...   "Playing go" he said, "Playing go will not lead to anything, it will certainly not help your studies".   "How's that?" the girl opposite of the bespectacled man asked.   "Playing go is an addiction, the game is a drug, once you have experienced the touch of the stones, the smell of the wooden board, the thrill, you'll be hooked to it forever, maybe longer."   "No way! You can't be serious, professor. I know you're taking me for a ride. Treating me as if I were a freshman who doesn't know how to play, uh?"   The graying man took of his eyeglasses and allowed himself a smile, only just from the corners of his mouth. While rubbing the bridge of his nose he recalled how many times before he had warned youngsters just as the 19-year-old sophomore in front of him now, to no avail. Why would nobody believe him, why on earth did he even bother trying to warn these know-it-all kids? While putting back his glasses he bent from the waist and looked the comfortably seated brunette square in the eyes, "listen, how long have you been playing? Two, three weeks? Do you think you mastered the rules up to the point that you're able to get a glimpse of the infinite possibilities of the game?   "Sure, professor McLaren, no sweat, I still can't see what the fuss is all about, trying to capture stones of your opponent while not forgetting to look after your own stones, piece of cake"   "I take it then, that you're familiar with terms as "two eyes, a ko-fight, seki, and approach move?" the patient professor continued, "You also know that at the end of the game stones which cannot be saved anymore may be removed and counted as prisoners? You know that the dame points have to be filled in because otherwise counting the score might become confusing? You know all that and the other tens of small details necessary to master in order to be able to begin to comprehend what the game is all about?"   "Oh, so now you're trying to impress me with difficult sounding stuff, very impressive, professor? Oops, I've got to get going if I'm to make it to my Asian culture class. I still don't understand why you try to keep me from playing such a innocent game as go, you of all people must know that's an important part of South East Asian culture. Well, see you next week, professor, thanks for the tea, ciao"   Professor McLaren was alone again in his messy-in-an-organized-way office, Caren, as the name of his pupil was, Caren would fall for the temptations of go, there was no doubt in his mind, he'd seen it happening over and over again. Ignoring her so far successful study, ignoring her friends, her social live. Possibly she'd pick up a nasty habit too, smoking or something, while she'd spent the prime of her live sitting in front of a piece of wood, contemplating where to next put an oval piece of glass. Trying to beat the nerdy looking opponent often burdened with jam-jar like glasses and a bad complexion. McLaren sighed and knew that he had done what he could to keep the girl away from such a dark future, away from the game of go. Somehow realizing this made him feel sadder even. Resigned he slouched in the enormous chair at his desk and spoke the words to activate the computer at his desk "Hello Dave".   "Good day, professor McLaren, the usual I presume?" spoke the silky computer voice while a LCD screen was sliding out of the desk top and erected itself in front of the professor. "Let's see, where was I, oh, yes, installment 5."   He was glad the university had signed a contract with a local catv provider, the speed of the connection was way better than at his own place, which was, to be sure, out in the middle of nowhere. "Ah, here we are, thank you James". " 'Pleasure, Sir" McLaren's computer replied. "Let's see what we can pick-up here this time, a junky might as well enjoy himself" McLaren was muttering to himself while he started to read the web page on the jumbo-sized screen.   "Playing go" he said, "Playing go will..."
