On Friday, we're scheduled to go back for an  urlLink EEG , for which Kristen must be up all night the night before, so that she can sleep for the test.  (Note to self: If I ever have to take this test, there will be no need for such preparation.)  Since the  urlLink cat-scan  didn't indicate anything the day of the seizure, as long as there are no indications that she is predisposed to more seizures from the EEG, that will pretty much be the end of it.  At that point, we're just to keep her out of situations where another seizure would be particularly dangerous (heights, baths, operating heavy machinery) for a few months, and to be aware of the  urlLink proper course of actions  should another one occur (lie her on her side, remove her glasses, keep her from hurting herself).  Should she have another seizure, we'd call the Neurologist, who would prescribe the recommended drugs.  Should she have more than one within a few hours of one another, we'd take her to the emergency room again.  I'll update this when we have results from the EEG.
