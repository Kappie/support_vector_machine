I want to be able to share my faith with others and not be embarrassed or feel guilty about smoking. -I want to be free from addiction in my life.  I don't want any substance or sin to have control over me. -I will save approximately $50 a month - money I could use to buy CD's, books or other fun stuff -I don't want to feel like a "second class citizen" anymore -For my health and to have a better quality of life   If you've quit smoking before, what worked well for you and what didn't?  I haven't really tried to quit before.  I was really sick with strep throat 2 weeks ago and, as a result, I didn't smoke for 6 days.  I decided it would be a good time to quit because I already had one week behind me, but I don't think I wanted to quit bad enough.   What improvements and changes can you make?  I can go in the office or out on the balcony to study and do homework   What will be your most challenging situations, and how do you plan to handle them?  My wife does not want to quit smoking.  I know she will help me to quit and support me in any way she can, but the fact is that she is still going to smoke.  It will be hard to resist smoking when I see cigarettes and cigarette boxes (full or empty) around the apartment.  When she smokes around me, it will be difficult to resist casually lighting up with her. Driving in the car, I will have urges to smoke ... but if I don't have cigarettes in the car I will be okay. Going out to the club and when I drink . . . I should stay away from those types of environments for at least a month When I'm at home with not much to do on the weekend ... I plan to take up eating Ben  Jerry's ice cream more regularly again.  If I am really fiending for a cigarette I will eat some nummy ice cream, followed by some kind of activity to make myself busy (homework, going for a walk, playing with the cats, going for a short drive, playing computer games maybe?) At school, I might be tempted to go out for a smoke between classes or on break ... I will not allow myself to go outside where the smokers congregate during school.   What can you do to change your environment to promote breaking the associations you have to smoking?  Avoid going out to the smoking area on breaks and lunch at work Talk to my wife about not smoking around me and not offering me cigarettes (not even giving me cigarettes if I ask for them)   What do you like about smoking?  It was new and interesting when I started 2 years ago At first, I liked trying all different kinds of cigarettes and I liked making my own cigarettes (sort of a hobby) I like smoking when I drink . . . I don't know why, they just kind of go together Part of me likes the rebellious aspect of smoking and being a smoker I like casually smoking while I read, study  do homework I like smoking while watching TV - I used to not even watch T.V. but now look at me ... debauchery!!!   :  ) I like to drive with my windows down and good music turned up loud while I have a cigarette I like the social aspect ... do I really?  What does that mean?   What do you hate about your addiction?  I hate the smell of my clothes and wondering if other people think I smell like an ashtray . . . I don't think I do but ... I am 26 years old and a married adult, but my parents, family and in-laws don't know I smoke (or maybe they do?).  I hate hiding part of my life from them.  It's such a stupid little thing in my mind, but I know it would make my parents and family very sad if they knew I smoked. I think I'm a fairly intelligent person, but smoking is bad for me and a horribly stupid thing to do.  I feel stupid knowing how terrible smoking is, but I still do it anyways.   Who can you count on for support?  My wife will help me in any way she can (sans-quitting herself), I know she will stand behind me in anything that I want to do. My friend, Darick - he smokes occasionally, but he's not a "smoker".  He will be cool with me quitting and he's someone I can talk to about it.  urlLink About.com: Quit Smoking Forum    What benefits do you envision in your smoke free life?  I will have more money to spend on other things (CD's, books, coffee . . . maybe even put some in savings) I won't have to live with the guilt of being a "closet smoker" I will have more energy and have a better chance at living a healthy life free from the complications that smokers face I won't feel like a bad Christian for smoking . . . I will be a better example to others and be able to share my faith with others more easily.
