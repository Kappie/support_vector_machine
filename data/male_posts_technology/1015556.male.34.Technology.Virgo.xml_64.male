Religious and ideological pressure is not going in the intended direction, so "Osama Bin Laden may have helped many Muslims find Jesus", according to missions expert and author Patrick Johnstone. "Tens of thousands of Iranians came to faith in Jesus because of Ayatollah Khomeni. Since 11 September 2001, the number of Muslims seeking alternatives has grown massively. Many are afraid of extremism, and many are afraid to say anything at all, but many are secretly searching. There have been breakthroughs in Northern Africa, Indonesia and Nigeria, where the Gospel is bringing fruit. Thirty percent of India's Dalits are considering a change of religion, and a growing number are finding Jesus. Opinions Buddhism also has widely varying opinions, and is losing credit because of developments in the past decade. Major ideological blocs are not as impenetrable as we may initially believe," he said, calling for prayer for the parts of the world opening for the Gospel, and on Western Christians to make themselves available to God for long-term missionary work.
