I don't rememeber the last time I felt more alive when I saw Karl "I never win" Malone on the bench in street clothes.  The icing on the cake was when they interviewed Derek Fisher after the game and he was on the verge of crying.  Yes I've had many nights filled with sweet dreams after the Lakers lost.  I just hate the Lakers that much, even more so with Karl Malone on their roster.  So my hate list goes like this  1. Karl Malone 2. L.A. Lakers 3. The Devil  Although I bet the first 2 on my list is in cahoots with number 3, those fucking bastards love to stick together.  Well I should be getting back to something resembling work.  P.S. Die Karl Malone
