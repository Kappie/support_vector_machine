I also need a good flash. I don't want to compromise on the flash. It has to be the best in its class.  I was eyeing on the Nikon SB-80. I called the local dealer yesterday to find out the price. He told me that Nikon SB-80 has been discontinued. So now it has to be SB-800; the latest and the best flash in the Nikon lineup.  Now my dilemma is whether to buy both FM3a and SB-800 - which will take me back by INR 40k - or buy either the camera or the flash. If it's only one, which one ? The flash  or the camera ?  If I had just the money to buy these two, I would've just bought it without a second thought. More the money, it's more difficult to spend.
