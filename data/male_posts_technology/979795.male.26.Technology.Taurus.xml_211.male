Looks like if I cannot write my program properly, I have another shot at it by writing a better report. The weightage isn't very clear/well defined. I think they really need to see your program and your report to be able to give an overall score. Still got hope lah basically. Must fully use the next 2 weeks to write 1 swee swee report.  After the group meeting, I met him in the labs to clarify some VRML thingy he already told me before. Heng, he's quite patient with me. Seems like I'm very kok-headed. Anyway I'm just waiting for my coursemate to finish his class before we go back to my place for makan. Beats walking back alone.  Only lastnight, my ex-girlfriend's housemate got robbed. I only heard about it this morning. The moment he left the train station, 4 guys shoved him against the fence and robbed him of his mobile and train pass (dunno if he lost any money). Heard they were going to beat him up but when they saw someone coming they ran off instead. Frankly, just imagining myself in his shoes and I feel a bit pumped up with adrenaline. Not because I want to nikkyo them lah. But because there's a sort of helplessness in the situation. I'm not sure I would've resisted (of whether I can in the 1st place). It's lucky that my ex got home just before her housemate did. I can't imagine how dangerous it would've been for her to have been robbed by the 4 guys.  I guess I'll just have to keep my eyes peeled whenever I pass by that area late. And I think the guys in the house need to take more care and effort to meet the girls and walk them back home. Really terrible. Wish I was able to take 4 guys on or at least have 'that' kinda level of Aikido that I don't have to worry about being attacked suddenly. Haiz ... Aikido o shimasu, gambatte kudasai!!!
