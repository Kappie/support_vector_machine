     
      i live in a colorful neighborhood  white/tan/black/yellow/brown/spicy people all over the place  i'm friendly and I like to wave at people when they drive by because it makes me feel like i'm not as depressed  lonely as I really am - anyways  most everybody waves at me because i always initiate the wave, regardless of what flavor they are - except the yellow people  i don't understand it - they just drive by and look at me like i just punted their dog over my house  i only have a few yellow friends and they really like me but...maybe their is something that they aren't telling me that is keeping me from acceptance in the yellow community  maybe i will ask the black kids that play on my basketball hoop - they seem pretty sharp
