I actually didn't have to work OT today, so I'm just chillin waitin for Tim to go hang out for a bit. Woo hoo! Unfortunately, I'll be doing tons of OT for the next couple of weeks, so my one whole break will probably be moving on Saturday. Fun times.   What the hell is SFS? ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, wait, I get it. nevermind.   Noich noich noich.   Snoochie Boochies. Who the hell says Snoochie boochies? That's like baby talk or something.
