Now, my girls, the youngest two especially, are spending much of their day in the pool.  And yes, we are VERY strict about the "no one swims alone" rule.  We knew a family who lost their two-year old son and his two-year old cousin at the same time due to an unsupervised pool (they mistakenly believed the gate was locked).  That is a tradgedy the mere contemplation of which brings me to a difficult emotional state.  Even though all my kids can swim and the pool is not so deep that even the youngest can stand with her head above the water, accidents can happen.  So either swim with a sister or have mom or dad within earshot (no going back in and watching TV or playing on the computer).    Now we've got to get the water pH balanced which will take overnight and then we'll have to apply a heavy dose of chlorine, too.  We've been using it but the pool is essentially just tap water right now and it is starting to show it.    So, it can be viewed as a bit of an inconvenience, I suppose.  But they're not in it all the time and it gives me motivation to hurry on home.  That and the fresh bottles of  urlLink Bombay Saphire and Schwepp's Tonic .  By the grace of God, I do give thanks that I live in a civilized world.  Oh, and we've already noticed the beginings of a secondary benefit.  Our second daughter, the middle schooler with learning disabilities, is not only away from the TV more (poor thing has no friends as she is emotionally immature), but she is challenging herself physically in the pool. After seeing me do it, she tried to do a handstand but she failed.  However, after just a little coaxing  she tried again !  It's difficult to express how wonderful that is.  Her epilepsy and learning disabilities has also caused a delay in her emotional and physical-control maturity.  Also, as an LD kid, she is so used to failure that her self-esteem is lower than dirt.  To see her push herself even after meeting with defeat was one of those small but great moments of being a parent.
