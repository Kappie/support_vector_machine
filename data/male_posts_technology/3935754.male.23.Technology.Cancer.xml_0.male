I worked this morning and ended up taking off in the early afternoon to go to take Pegge and her son Justin to the airport. While I was dreading missing work and getting even more behind on my projects, it turned out to be just the thing that I needed.  On the one hour drive to the airport, I ended up having a really good conversation with Pegge about what my expectations are for the next year. I shared a lot about how I am feeling right now, expressing the emotions that I'm really struggling with. We then talked about how other people in the community are reacting to the changes, and it felt really good to know that I'm not the only one that am feeling the way that I am. I think that everyone is trying to figure out how to process their frustrations, and in some cases - anger. It helps to know that maybe other changes are at hand with how this is going.  I also felt a great deal of clarity towards what I am going to do next year. First off, I talked about how I wanted to do a lot of the "PR" work for University Ministry. I think that we're all in agreement that it would be great to make sure that all communications and marketing is gone through one source, and that we can make sure that we have all the same language about things. I would really like that too because this is an opportunity to for me to develop my creativity. Secondly, I will work with leading and mentoring the Spirit Fire student leadership group, which I also think will be very helpful - both for me and for them. I really enjoy working with these students, and I think that it'll be great chance for me to help them grow to where they need to go as well.  I guess what will be interesting is making sure that I have the appropriate boundries and limitations in what I do. I'm don't think that it'll be easy to do either. It's so easy just to be accepting of what people are asking of me, but at the same time, I need to figure out a way to say "no".  After I dropped Pegge and Justin off at the airport, I went to go see my best friend Kristi for the first time in over a month. Kristi was my best friend in high school and in many ways is still my best friend now. It's amazing how much I'm still able to connect, despite the ways that we've really developed into two different people. What was neat is that as soon as I got there, she came up with the idea of going to a Rockies game. That was the first time in my life where I spontaneously planned on going to a sporting event, and it was an awesome time! The Rockies ended up winning too - something that you don't see too often ;-)  Last night I was hoping just to swing by, maybe have dinner with Kristi, but it was really neat how it turned into a whole evening. I was down there a lot longer than I was planning to, andI was really tired to be getting in at midnight, but at the same time it was a lot of fun.I need to go down to baseball games more often...
