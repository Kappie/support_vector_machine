I firmly believe that Johnny and June are singing "Jackson" together somewhere right now to a stunned audience.  Today's list is my top five J.R. Cash songs: 1.  Sunday Morning Coming Down - "the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad so I had one more fore dessert" 2.  I Walk The Line 3.  Jackson 4.  Folsom Prison Blues 5.  Big River  Also receiving votes:  Ring of Fire, Understand Your Man, and Ballad of Ira Hayes    I will wear black today and play every Johnny Cash song I know how to play on the guitar.  I will then learn some that I don't know.
