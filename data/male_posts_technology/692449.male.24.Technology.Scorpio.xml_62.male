With only a couple weeks left of school I really need to make sure I do everything I can to get good grades, but I have this natural lazyness that always gets in my way. Well at least I can motivate myself 80%-70% of the time. If only I could get that number up. Any ideas? Remeber you can email me with the contact button at the top of the screen.
