We got in line at 4:10, and the speakers started at 6:15. It was almost 7:45 before we saw Sen.. Kerry speak. I thought it was a good speech! It was an excellent chance to see THE future President of the USA in person.  In 1991 we got to see Al Gore talk at the Waterloo, IA airport, along with Sen.. Tom Harkin. Tonight we got to see Sen. Harkin again, introducing John Kerry. We also got to hear a few other local politicians, and we also  got to have 3 songs sung to the crowd by David Grohl from FooFighters, and one time drummer for Nirvana. I've heard the songs that he sang on the radio, with the full band, and they sounded way different, but enjoyable ( urlLink Z*lda  didn't like them).  We just got home about 30 minutes ago, so we were there almost 5 hours, but it didn't seem like that long. We had to wait in line about a half-hour, and then go through a metal detector system. This meant that as we went by we had 2 sets of keys on the table, 3 PDAs (mine and the boys), a digital camera, and a purse. It was a very interesting experience, but it was worthwhile!  There was a quick little  jab  that they mentioned that I did like too. They had a little quip, referring to the current President Bush, and his father... it was  "Like father like son, one term and he's done."  That stuck in my mind, really liked it for some reason :-)
