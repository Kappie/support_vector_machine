Lots of free shots at Wildflowers, that place is the shit. Thanks to Adrienne, Cooper and Maryanne for hookin it up. Also thanks to the dudes in the band who let my drunk ass sing Hotel California. (Craig knew they would) My wingman craig also had me doing silly silly things, which resulted in my getting kicked out of both Mcguinn's and Buddy Shamrocks.  Oh wait that was probably my fault. It's not easy to stand when you got the "Doug Sway" going on. That wall looked like the perfect place to rest. Haha. Apparently you can't be hanging on the walls at bars now a days or you get kicked out. Good thing we had enough time to get a picture with every single person at the bar hahaha. Shouts to camerawoman kimbo kickin ass and taking names.  A little scandalousness ensued but nothing a drunken birthday with good friends can't justify. (plus it was craigs fault)   Buddy shamrocks had that shit coming too because of it's stupid name.  I think i should listen to my dad and not drink hard liquor because i really cant tell you why the hell i threw that cup. Funny as hell though, i hope they don't remember me next time.  Oh and on the way home i ripped down some advertisment and then a couple of mailboxes took a beaten because, well, i do stupid things like that when im drunk. Thanks to all who bought me drinks and thanks connie for buying me dinner. Oh and thanks for the good company too, u old folks really made my 21st a great time.  Sorry for all the youngins i also hang out with that couldnt come,but your time will come and old Douglas Fresh will be there to celebrate with you.  In conclusion 1craig+1Doug+8titties=Goodtime.
