Luckily the day is almost over so I'm kind of coasting into the weekend.  Had rehearsal over at the Mason's lodge on Wednesday and had a great time.  I really enjoy being with the guys and learning the protocols of opening and closing the lodge is very interesting.  I'm learning that my ability to do an 'about-face' is lacking.  Note to self... Don't wear rubber-soled shoes on meeting nights.  They have the propensity to grip the carpet when doing an about-face which I'm sure will eventually send me spilling to my keester in front of everyone.  Funny thing with all of this is that I was asked to be Senior Steward, instead of Junior Steward.  Honestly, I didn't really know what each office did, but I'm finding out that the Senior Steward, among other things, takes care of the kitchen and the meals for the lodge.  I'm kind of looking forward to do that, although I'm quite sure that it is going to take up a goodly chunk of time.  Lori, though, is quite supportive so it doesn't look like it is going to be any hardship.  I've also been spending my lunches with Larry at the Game Keeper.  It's usually always quite interesting visiting him and seeing the folks that wondering into the store.  Sid Sackson's  Sleuth  is now for sale.  I'd really like to get it, but we're a bit short on funds at the moment.  I'm going to call Lori to see if we can scrape up enough so we can get it for the weekend.  It would be fun to play while at the park with the kids.  I'm also hoping I can get a picnic setup in the next few weeks to have some friends over to the park and either play lawn type games or board games.  More later.
