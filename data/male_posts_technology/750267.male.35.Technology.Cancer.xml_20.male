I made a prediction to some friends earlier this week that "this guy has finally made a mistake -- for the first time, several witnesses saw him and can describe him, its only a matter of days before an arrest will be made". Boy, was I wrong. The entire story (van/taillight/ladder/AK74/dark skinned) was concocted by one witness? And it turns out he was making the whole thing up? And so, as a result, the police has no (or at best, conflicting and confusing) information. If anything, the police are worse off today than they were a week ago -- at least a week ago the public was looking for anything, now the public is only looking for Arabs/Hispanics with creme colored vans and AK-74s!   Even if they eventually arrest the sniper, a good lawyer should be able to pull an "O.J." :: get an acquittal through confusing and conflicting evidence.  If we learned anything from the O.J. trial, its that if you get a high-profile case, with hundreds of detectives, lawyers, experts, witnesses, etc. Any piece of evidence can be made to look like anything. Every witness can be made to be a liar.   And, I distinctly remember watching CNN on Monday afternoon, and hearing the reporter say "It looks like the sniper has taken a long weekend off" or something to that effect. I wonder if this VERY statement on CNN caused the sniper to go out and shoot someone, just to prove the reporter wrong...
