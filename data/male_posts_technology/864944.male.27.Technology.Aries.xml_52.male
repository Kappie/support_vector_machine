Every day I would drive past it and wish that Chris and I had a couple of Kayaks to tool around the water with. But naturally Kayaks are a little cost prohibitive. New ones range from 350-1000+ each, and used ones didnt seem much better.    It turns out that our neighbors, Nathan and Miraim, also had been dreaming of kayaks. So we both "pooled" together and decided to buy one kayak each. Now to find used kayaks that werent total crap.    Enter  urlLink Craig's List . How this site got so popular I have no idea.. but If you want classifieds or rides.. or pretty much anything else for a city, this is the site. We managed to find someone in Foxboro selling two used Kayaks for $250 each. WINNER!    Nathan and Chris made it down there, tried them out, and POW.. we now own 2 kayaks. A couple life vests and paddles later, and we're good to go.    After taking them out a couple times, Chris and I discovered one problem. We can work together to carry 2 kayaks down to the river entrance (both of us grab a handle on each kayak), but if we wanted to go alone, we couldnt see how to get the kayaks down there without killing ourselves (or involving a car which seems silly for 2 blocks).    Enter : THE KAYAK HAND TOW    I was thinking that all we needed to do was make something with two wheels on it, get it strapped to the bottom of a kayak, and we could tow it down the sidewalk to the water. But I am no engineer (at least if its not software ;p) so I wanted to modify something that was CLOSE to what we wanted to start with. My choice? A wheeled garbage Can.    I began by cutting the can at an angle (so when the kayak rests on it, it is tilted for the wheels to work) . These pics are after the work.. i didnt think to get a starting shot.         Next I take the bottom, carve out a couple curves, and drill some holes into the sides for a bungee cord.         Strap it to about the middle of the Kayak and VOILA! You can tow it with one hand!          Im so clever :)
