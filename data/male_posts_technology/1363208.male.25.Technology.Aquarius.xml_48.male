       
      [mood: okay, i guess] [listening to: my own thought] [current project: explaining]   This is the conclusions that I derived from what I've been thinking about while I was on the bridge (Penang Bridge) just now...  - I'm not ready to love anybody in any special way. - I don't want to hurt anyone's feeling at the same time. - Friends are my priority. Special-friend is not in the list yet. - I'm ego, yeah. And I'm not melt.  :( :( :(
