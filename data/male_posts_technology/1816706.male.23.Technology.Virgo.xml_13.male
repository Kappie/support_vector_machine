This time it was just me and Thomas each in our own kayak.  We kayaked down to a bend where you can go to the right and do a nice short 30 minute hike to a decent set of waterfalls.  It’s pretty cool, but seems to have gotten too touristy, but it was a Saturday morning though.  After that we got back on the river and kayaked a little further down to the Fern Grotto which is just basically a really nice park with great plant life.  Came back to the hostel for a little after that, then headed to the South side of the island.  We went to Poipu beach just for a little, then checked out Spouting Horn which is a whole in the ground where waves will crash through it and make it look like water is shooting like a blowhole in a whale, pretty sweet.  After that we did a drive up to Waimea Canyon lookout.  Waimea Canyon is the Grand Canyon of the Pacific.  It looks just like that too, my pictures didn’t turn out so great, but we got there at sunset so it was a little dark, but still pretty nice.  We could still see the forbidden island of Ni’ihau which is an island off the coast of Kauai that no one is allowed to visit.  Only the couple hundred people that live there are allowed to go there.  Afterwards we hit a local brewpub in the city of Waimea and headed back home.    p.s. Happy Birthday to Kenna!
