Doug's handicap was the perpetually full burr strapped to his hand and midge racket, and Kimbo was naaasssty.  It was the Special Olympics. Holla @ Luke for being a little yellow bitch. Fresh box of wine has arrived. Its a regular burrbq bday but we're taking a little trip to Wildflowers.  Adrienne is behind the bar...
