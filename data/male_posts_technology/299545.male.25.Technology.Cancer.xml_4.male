[excuse]I was super-busy with finals/thesis/projects at the end of november and the beginning of december, and since then, I've been very busy doing nothing in particular (shopping, relaxing, hanging with family and home-friends).[/excuse]  Oh well. Hopefully I will be better as the end of this vacation nears, and make good and making this page something less useless (other than it's ability to stoke my geekness).  While you're here, check some of the pages that I've been reading lately to waste time:  urlLink wilwheaton.net   urlLink metafilter   urlLink buddha   urlLink slashdot
