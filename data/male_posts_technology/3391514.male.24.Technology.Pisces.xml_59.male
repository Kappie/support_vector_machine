Games will be delayed this week thanks to certain individuals.  At least I got round to watching  The Fifth Element .   Heroland  saw some revisions, but I haven't had the time or personnel to test them out yet.  It'll probably be a few months, like  DSR .  Otherwise, life is a bit shit at the moment.
