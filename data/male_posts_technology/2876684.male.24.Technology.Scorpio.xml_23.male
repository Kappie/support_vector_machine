Anyways, I went to see Kill Bill (Vol.2) on Thursday since it was the first night of screening and I came out somewhat disappointed - it was quite different from the first film and there was hardly any swordplay (which for me was the highlight of the first one). And there wasn't even a flashback of a certain psychotic, ball and chain swinging, schoolgirl we all know and love. :(  Friday night's training was cancelled because we had a social night at Moore Park. One of our students, Leigh, is the resident golf pro there and teaches at the driving range in the evenings, so we got together after his private lessons and swung a few. It's safe to say I was by far the worst at swinging the club, and it will take me another few thousand swings before I start to show any sort of consistency, but it sure does feel good when you get the mechanics right and the ball just sails away.  I went down to the Annandale Hotel on Saturday afternoon to check out this guitar expo they were having, which was really just a performance featuring the instruments (no we couldn't touch them). I was a bit disappointed, but it was a good afternoon of music - they had Diesel come in to play a few numbers, and the guy hosting the event played a really mean guitar too. He's probably a session guitar player or something, he was changing styles at will (country, rock, jazz, you name it) and he sounded equally good in all of them. Watching a performance like that can either seriously inspire you or convince you to stop trying. Good thing for me I didn't decide to become a professional guitarist, because I would have probably given up then. :P  I wandered around the city afterwards met a friend at Books Kinokuniya, who was on her way to meet up with her kendo clubmates to go watch Kill Bill (Vol. 2). I ended up tagging along and watching the movie the second time around made me appreciate it more - I guess Tarantino's films are like that, he uses a lot of subtlety and you can't really spot everything in only one sitting. Well, I'm waiting for the double DVD set to come out now. :)  Last night I went to the W Hotel (situated just right by Harry's De Wheels) for Sham's last minute bday drinks, and the cafe / lounge there is just awesome! I've never been to a place quite like and it's got really good atmosphere - perfect place to sit around and chill with your friends. Sham is really amazing, she knows so many people and it always boggles the mind how she can keep up with everyone. She basically picked up where we left off our last conversation even though I last saw her probably 6 weeks ago now - I wish I had a memory like that.  She introduced me to the guy she's currently dating and turns out the guy went to ADFA (Australia Defence Force Academy) and was an officer in the Air Force. I'm planning to enter the Air Force Reserves after I get my permanent residency so we had a good long chat about that - he thinks I can make it in without a problem, and I'm hoping he's right! I was also introduced to another of her friends, and it turned out we went to the same college in Singapore (I'm her senior by 4 years) and that she now hopes to do documentaries after she gets out of UNSW. What's even funnier is that her dad is involved in their church's media ministry in Singapore, which is exactly what I used to do back in Brunei.  Well I left a bit early (11pm) and grabbed a De Wheels hotdog before I headed home, and I still had to catch the nightride because I missed the last train out of central - the bus took longer than usual as well since the driver was making stops along the way that weren't necessarily on the route to let people off. A woman started bitching about how it was incoveniencing her and the bus driver got up and started having a go at her (which I didn't realise at first since I was happily listening to my iPod), but I did catch the last bits which were,  "The ride is incovenient for everyone and I'm trying to do some people a favour, and if anyone has a problem with that you can get off the bus and catch a cab home. I'm trying to make sure people get home safely."  And the passengers cheered the driver.
