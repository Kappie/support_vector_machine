It didn't matter that my cousin has talked to us for like a year before today. Or that I'm probably the one who is gonna have to handle the dogs while he is off to work. Or that the 3 of them will make a hell lot of noise and give the neighbour upstairs another chance to call the cops on us. Some people just dun know how to say NO i guess. I am in a really irritable mood today, its like male PMS or something !
