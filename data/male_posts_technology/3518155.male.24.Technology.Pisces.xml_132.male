She will be in Oklahoma all week, and I have to figure out how to survive alone for the next few days. I'm hoping the cats know how to call for help, should it be necessary.  Tried out a new bagel shop,  Main St. Bagels , that has started operating right outside my apartment complex. Well, more like, was  forced  to go find some breakfast, since the kind folks at the apartment complex front office decided to play a game of  Lets-pretend-you-don't-exist  by sticking an "Away" sign at the office entrance and refusing to let anyone in, although I could very clearly see human activity on the inside. I did get in, eventually, and finally got my hands on a precious Fedex package containing Clapton concert tickets for later in the evening.  During the afternoon, Chris and I hiked along one of the trails at   urlLink Almaden Quicksilver County Park  . Although it was, perhaps, the hottest time of the day, I was quite refreshed at the end of it all and, strangely enough, was not sweating profusely. There were a few good views of San Jose along the way, and also a couple of encounters with the local wildlife (think snake and rabbit). Too bad Rachel took the camera with her. *sulk*. After the hike, we treated ourselves to some spicy Mussaman beef curry at little Thai place (whose name escapes me right now), and picked up some Mango Mochi (which I am enjoying right now..) at  urlLink  Trader Joe's  .  Attended an Eric Clapton concert at night with Apu and his roommate. >  What a fantastic show! Clapton played some of the meanest blues I've heard in ages; and what a great support cast he has! Their soulful, hear-wrenching rendition of  Have You Ever Loved a Woman  contained the best individual solos of the entire concert, although Clapton's insane guitar solo during  I Shot The Sheriff  wasn't one bit less enjoyable. Clapton switched gears in the middle of the show to play some crisp acoustic blues, mostly from his new album,  urlLink  Me and Mr. Johnson  . All numbers performed to perfection, as expected.  All in all, thoroughly satisfying, and worth every dime spent on the tickets. :)  Good day so far ...
