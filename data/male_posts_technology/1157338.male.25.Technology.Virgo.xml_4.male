Provided I can remember to view the blog of course.  My name is Phillip Martin, I live in Oklahoma (currently Stillwater).  Have a B.S. in Computer Science, working on my Master's degree after having been laid off by Worldcom back in June of 2002. I am married, wife's name is Shanna, we met back when I was a Sophomore, October of 1997. Got married in February of 2001 on the 10th. Send us anniversary presents if you'd like.  Graduate school is not totally my bag, having a time readjusting to school life, especially since most of my friends have graduated or gone. A few have come back, as I did, some just left after I got here, and others are just MIA.   It is weird how many people I still know here, and how little "College Life" has really changed overall. Frat guys and sorority girls still wear those damn T-Shirts. I can still spot the pseudo intellectuals from 3 latte's away, and of course, the afternoon-after partier, still reeking of stale beer and cigarettes while sitting next to you in the Student Union Foodcourt. The opinion writers in the school paper still write from a position showing a real lack of knowledge of the world beyond highschool/college (with the exception of maybe C. Brook Kurtz, who has apparently returned to OSU with me).  One thing that glares at me, is the absence of Preacher Bob (not his real name).  I miss that guy, was very entertaining.   Anywho - I'll get off the College hasn't changed and everyone's still stupid soapbox now. I'm hoping this will be an entertaining enough first post - and if not, go read my buddy Brian's post about his Critical Analysis class on his little blog over  urlLink  here    Later all
