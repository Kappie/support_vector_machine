I mean it wouldn't be so bad if you thought it was supposed to take this long. I mean this shit on any other computer in the office only took like 5-10 minutes. But here, on this POS, I'm stuck with 37 minutes left:P  Oh well, at least it means I'll type more;) I'm going to Squish and Dan's on the 12th if anyone wants to come. They said to invite you:) (ok, they only named 2, but I'm sure they're cool with meeting new peeps;)) Also, they got a house, so there should be enough room for us all.  Well, it's true, the more I type the faster it goes. So, I'm now also downloading,  urlLink this piece of spam shit  that my boss paid for. That's actually been my entire job over the past 2 days. Get a computer that he can Terminal Service into and set up that program on....  The sad thing, the program is downloading at 83 KB/sec, the fuckin IE6 more like 10KB/sec:P  You'd think MS, being across the lake as it is would be faster, but NOoooOOOOoooo, poop on them:)  Jeopardy theme song... "Do do do do Do Do Doooo, Do do do do DO, do do do do do...."  Would somebody please STOP THE INSANITY????!?!?!?!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :)
