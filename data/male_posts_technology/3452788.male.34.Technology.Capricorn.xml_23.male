When she was born, somehow I just knew that her place in my life would be to introduce chaos and keep my life interesting.  I am always set in my ways and try to be very logical about making decisions or taking action, not making waves, stay within the lines.  Nikki is spontaneous and random, unwilling to blindly accept the authority of time, custom, or parental mandate (especially me).    Last night she decides that she wants me to take her to the beach while Anne and Daniel go to swimming class.  I immediately can think of several reasons why this is not a good idea - homework, school night, she will need a bath, cold, windy, I don't feel like it, what about dinner, and more.  When I thought about it for a few minutes, though, I guess it might be possibly OK to maybe see if there is some way it could be possible... (very decisive here, huh?) ... and I allowed myself to think WHY NOT instead of NO WAY.  Why not go to the beach?  There is nothing wrong with having fun during the week, we can spend time together without the two kids competing, as long as we don't stay too late, etc.  So we went, and it was fine, not tremendously fun but not bad in any way, it simply was being there.  Of course she was bossing me around much of the time, but we built a hole in the sand with stairs leading up, and we found a beach flea (a small crustacean).    Kids seem to understand how to do things without any sort of expectation about how it should be, or if everyone is satisfied at the end, or without worrying about what other people might think.  I can learn a lot from her.   I hope she will remain this way, despite anything I might say or do, because it will make us both better people.  Everyone like me needs someone in their life that is like her.  In high school, I became best friends with a girl who always kept me off-balance, who wasn't afraid to do something offbeat just for fun, and who was willing to take my hand and force me to learn something new.  Now, the role belongs to my daughter, and I'm grateful for it.
