I am going to try to find places to use some of the names of the larger numbers. "I thought about leaving work early and sneaking home to see my wife sexdecillion times today." Oooh... adds a whole new dimension to the language.      Number of zeros    Name      3  thousand     6  million     9  billion     12  trillion     15  quadrillion     18  quintillion     21  sextillion     24  septillion     27  octillion     30  nonillion     33  decillion     36  undecillion     39  duodecillion     42  tredecillion     45  quattuordecillion     48  quindecillion     51  sexdecillion     54  septendecillion     57  octodecillion     60  novemdecillion     63  vigintillion     100  googol     10^100  googolplex
