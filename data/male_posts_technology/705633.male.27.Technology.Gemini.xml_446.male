We all agreed to meet Custard for his lunch hour, plan being to get a bite to eat. The plans soon changed and we ended up sitting down at the Blue Fish, eating fine food, drinking fine beer, and chatting to the fine Australian waitress (oh she was fine!). At the end of this we lost Custard to his work commitments, he is the only unfortunate one of us who has to work on a Saturday!  So after a few more beers at the Blue Fish, Toaster, Dougal and I headed off to Chicago Rock Cafe with thoughts of further alcahol consumption! We spent the following three hours drinking Margarettas, vodka, and eating a foot high tower of doughnuts!!  Next we headed off to Dougals flat and shot up some zombies on his Dreamcast. Dougals wife to be cooked us a roast dinner, which was nice.  Custard met us up at this point.  At about 9:30pm we all headed into town and proceeded to drink in most of towns drinking holes before heading up to the rave at Fort Regent. The rave turned out to be quite a laugh, sporting alot of totty (most of which was stuck up it's own ass!), a well stocked bar, and a quality chill out room to boot. We all grooved away in the main hall, however the best room in the place was the chill out room, which played indian pipe music and other calming stuff.  The highlight of the night turned out to be when Toaster, Custard and I had been in the chill out room for about half an hour playing mini air hockey (which they were giving away free with all vodka!). I was sitting down quite relaxed talking to the guys when a rather large bird sat on the guy next to me. This would have been fine except that she was half sitting her ass on me too, which got annoying!! Anyway we decided to head back off to the main hall. After carefull planning I decided that for maximum effect I had to act quickly, and I did. In one graceful movement I shot out of the chair I was in, which in turn meant that the large bird no longer had any support, which in turn meant that she fell flat on her face hehe!!! (am I evil...yeas I fucking am!!!!). The rest of the night was quite buzzing and we headed for home at about 3:30am.  Sunday has been relatively quite and relaxing, spending most of the time chilling and keeping track on the war! So in summary, a good weekend, in fact, the best I have had in a long time! Anyway, going to bed so post again soon.  Baity signing off.....
