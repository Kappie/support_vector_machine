Then enjoyed well ah Rini  Sindhu....hmmm  s Kavi, enna "                    " post idhu...........what does it mean...  kicha, try to c some figures out... then ur mind will be a bit relaxed to find out what is in IBM MQ series....  Yes, Ofcourse I enjoyed the Weekend at the most, went to an ashram nearby.... (JINDAL) U know its a great place... but can be maintained more than what its now....  after 3 months I watched TV, Heard about serials, Movies ( 1 malayalam, 1 english, 1 tamil, 1 hindi) Formula One Car Race.... then everything I can for the entire 2 days.... Cool food and nice sleep...  In that ashram they have the vishwaruppam statue of Lord Krishna and The Ratha(krishna  Arjuna) in a magnificiant height... Entire gita is depicted in Hindi, English and Kannada... Very nice place to visit... But I think if maintained properly, i.e, with much popularity etc... then it will match Kempfort Shiva Temple.....  Great yeah....  Yeah, was busy over the day.. hence read ur posts and mini one from my side...  Take care.. GN for Natives.... GE for UK's and GM for US's... catch u tommorrow.....
