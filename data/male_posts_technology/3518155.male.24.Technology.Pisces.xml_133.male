Fortunately, the nice folks at  urlLink  Guitar Showcase   had plenty in stock.   B-Street Billards turned out to be a nice little pool hall with a bar, high ceilings and a decent crowd that seemed to care for the blues. We were opening for another band,  urlLink  Casual Soul  , whose lead guitarist joined us for our 7 song set. It was good to see familiar faces in the audience, Chris, Peter and Alex from work, one of Rachel's colleagues and Apu. I think we did good; the crowd appeared pleased and some folks walked up to us and let us know how much they enjoyed it! Nothing like a little bit o appreciation. :) Apu showed his by buying us dinner at the   urlLink KingFish   across the street ..
