We fought for hours. Have you ever seen  urlLink Enter the Dragon ? It was just like that (I was Bruce Lee). In the end I summoned my life force and exiled them to the 37th dimension (one of the bad ones). But the damage was done. I had to enter my regeneration tank, complete with large screen TV and beer refrigerator, and was thus unable to spend any time writing. Tonight I’ll get some work done, although I don’t usually have much imagination on a Friday.
