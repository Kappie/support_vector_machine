I've enjoyed slacking yesterday and today, but I really really REALLY need to find myself a good job in my field.  Failing that, just a good job that works monday to friday and pays well will make me happy.  So my plan tomorrow is to call the dude who offered me a job like 18 months ago that I turned down for a different job (one of the biggest mistakes I've made in the past 2 years), surf my job sites for new openings, and send off a total of 6 resume's and cover letters.  Perhaps tomorrow is the day that something clicks.  Fingers crossed.  How come no one comments on my blogs???  :(
