 I was way off.  The banana didn't sit perfectly with my stomach, but it wasn't too bad.  My intestines, however, have been cramping for hours.  From 5 to 10 tonight.  It isn't severe, but it is really uncomfortable. 

 I had a bologna sandwich again at 10:00 tonight with the usual belching.  I've been eating too many of these lately and I'm sure it isn't helping, but its just easy to make without leaving the house. 

  Update:  I guzzled some water to finish off the Citrucel for today.  That was a very bad idea.  Firstly, it wasn't enough water for the ammount of powder I was taking, and second it is sitting in my stomach like a rock.  I'm doubled-over while I'm typing this, and the belching and bloating is bad. I'm going to be up late again tonight...
