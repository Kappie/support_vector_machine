Here's a blog called  urlLink victor is dead slash luna . Check out the cookie picture half way down. tee hee! Kind of links to the very funny Big Pie story on  urlLink Space Hardware .   Artist of the week :  urlLink N*E*R*D*    I've been listening to "Fly or Die" tonight, and it rocks! Yaaaar!*   *Erm, sorry, bit misleading that, there's no pirates on the album. Or mexican pirates. But it still rocks!!
