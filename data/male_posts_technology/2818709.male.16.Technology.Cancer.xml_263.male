Make the US history thing. 4. Put a tagboard or comments on here. Because people love me. And they want to talk to me. I'll figure it out.  Getchoo  This is beginning to hurt This is beginning to get serious It used to be a game Now it's a cryin' shame 'Cause you don't wanna play around no more  Sometimes I push too hard Sometimes you fall and skin your knee I never meant to do All that I've done to you Please baby say it's not too late  To get you, uh-huh Get you, uh-huh Get you, uh-huh Get you, get you, get you... uh-huh  You know this is breakin' me up You think that I'm some kind of freak, uh-huh But if you'd come back to me Then you would surely see That I'm just foolin' around  To get you, uh-huh Get you, uh-huh Get you, uh-huh Get you, get you, get you  I can't believe What you've done to me What I did do them You've done to me  To get you, uh-huh Get you, uh-huh Get you, uh-huh Get you, get you, get you  This is beginning to hurt This is beginning to hurt This is beginning to hurt This is beginning to hurt  --------------------------------  A kick-ass song.
