In any case, I've signed up for  urlLink Blogger . Sure, part of it is to see if I get any  urlLink Gmail  invites, but I've been debating creating a more professional weblog that others can tune into.  Ya, I do have a personal  urlLink one  over at  urlLink LiveJournal . Plus I have  urlLink another  on the  urlLink O'Reilly Network . That one's pretty professional, but it's also pretty Mac-centric. As much as I love the Macintosh, I do keep up with other technologies and such. I don't update the ON one very often, either.  So here we are, gentle reader. Enjoy my musings!
