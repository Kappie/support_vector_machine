After taking a break from Manila, flying off to  urlLink New York   then to  urlLink San Francisco  , I’m left with my zoned out, trés heavy, jet-lagged self. It’s not insomnia that haunts me. It’s having to wake up around 3:00 a.m. and not being able to sleep that kills me. As if my eye-baggin’ zombie self isn’t bad enough, getting the munchies at odd hours is just dietary suicide. The other night I just murdered 3  urlLink Krispy Kreme French Crullers   in a span of 5 minutes. I can’t go on like this… I really can’t… more like I shouldn’t.   What’s up with midnight snacks anyway? Why does it taste so good, and why do you get such a strong craving for certain things? I was watching some medical documentary on  urlLink Discovery channel   at 4 in the morning and still got this urge for a deluxe cheese burger, guacamole with chips, and chocolate.  Gotta get it together!!
