The bill would allow inmates sentenced to more than 200 years in prison or to life without parole a one-time chance to ask a judge to allow them to die.   urlLink - Bill offers inmates death option    right-to-lifers, assisted suicide, capital punishment... i wonder if as a society we're ever going to get past our collective schizophrenia about the legality of human death; we're all over the map in regards to when it's ok, and when it's not.     mir: adbusters rocks, but you knew that.  and as far as i can tell, god loves and hates everyone unconditionally.  it's universal, effortless, and comes at no extra charge.
