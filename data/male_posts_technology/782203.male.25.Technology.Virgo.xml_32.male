Had that one a few times now.  Woke up to find we were not. It's good to be awake.  Dreamed I was a tidal wave I ravaged your coast, there were no survivors.  Dreamed I was your landlord.  I showed you place when you had lovers.  If I was a vampire,  I wouldn't suck your blood.  Then I dreamed I was you.  Sweetest dream I have had.  If you could hear the dreams I've had, my dear,  They would give you nightmares for a week.  But you're not here and I can never sleep.  Come home so I can be a creep.
