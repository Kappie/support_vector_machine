Yours truly had some checks that got into the hands of the devil's handy men(or women for that matter). Okay so I am kidding about the DH men...just need a little humor. I came home on Wednesday from a relaxing evening in the suburbs to find a letter from Winco Foods notifying me of a dishonored check. I thought that was weird since I have not shopped there in forever and I certainly did not spend $129. I mean come on...I don't think I have EVER spent that much on groceries..I am single...well maybe when I was a youth leader and all of those teenagers eating me out of house and home. Anyways I called the store and found out there was another check for $98...called the bank the next day to find out it is 6 checks thus far. Did I mention that this is on my closed account from WA? Yeah so I had to file a police report, they are sending me some stuff to sign, then as far as I know now I will have to take a police report to each place that this person wrote a check..needless to say I was hacked. I was more stressed than anything.  Tommorow I am teaching on Phil. 4:6-7  Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.  Kinda funny the scripture that I have been studying for the last week and a half is perfectly applicable to my present life circumstances.  I have spent the last couple of days realizing how truly blessed I am, which leads me to being thankful. I have had a really shitty last year, but despite the ebb and flow of life I realize I always come out of it fine. I survive.   The God that is my very breathe, my very reason for living, is my strength. Father I thank thee.   I am thankful for relationships, love, truth. Father I thank thee.   Take time this week to be thankful for your existence, purpose, and His divine beauty shining on you.  Kat
