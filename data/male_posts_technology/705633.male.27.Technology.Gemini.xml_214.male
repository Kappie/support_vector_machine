We all went for "Chicken and Mozzarella" roll, which was in reality cold chips, crappy salad and luke warm chicken with cold, sliced mozzarella. I went back inside to get more ketchup for this banquet and was given a single sachet the size of a contact lense. I asked for a few more and I got another, tiny sachet. What a bunch of shite. God knows how much that place cost to build, and it's utterly depressing with rank food. The chocolate vending machine upstairs is just as polite, and more fulfilling.
