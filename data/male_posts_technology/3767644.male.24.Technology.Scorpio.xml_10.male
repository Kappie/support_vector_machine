(but who wants to live with a beautiful kidney anyway, or but ugly goes clean to the bone. ).  Life is good.  I am searching for someone who can love me ( trust me u ain't seen misery if u ain't seen me).        Pain has a face :- I am Pain        This time I will hold myself back and let the one who is equally interested do the talking.    I wish I run into her soon coz the wait ain't makin me any younger u C  .  Some one I can take home to momma and say     "mom we're comming home forever this time"      That reminds me i am dreaming again.    God I got to stop drinking like this.      ----------------------------------------------------------------------   How many dreams will end,   How long can i pretend,   How many times will Time pass me by   Untill I find you again.   { (C) Richard Marx}   ----------------------------------------------------------------------      Wish You were her,oops Here.
