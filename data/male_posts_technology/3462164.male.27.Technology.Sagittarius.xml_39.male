It would appear that the Arabs have forgotten their own teachings, since everyone is their enemy today. Even Al-Qaeda, which the Saudi's have supported for a long time, have started launching attacks on Saudi soil. While the Saudi citizens are angry about this, it is hard to have any sympathy for them, considering that they approve of terrorism as long as it is directed towards the United States or Israel. Even now, while the House of Saud claims that it is going to start cracking down on terrorists, they still go on national television and blame everything on Israel. The clerics, who are on the House of Saud's payroll also blame everything on the US and Israel. It is clear that they aren't interested in fighting terrorists, they are only interested in appearing to fight terrorists while maintaining good relations with us. This farce has gone on for too long, and it is time we issued an ultimatum to Saudi Arabia. Close down your madrassas that brainwash children into becoming terrorists, shut down all camps that train terrorists, and freeze the accounts of all known terrorists. In the meantime, we need to reevaluate our relationship with the two-faced House of Saud.
