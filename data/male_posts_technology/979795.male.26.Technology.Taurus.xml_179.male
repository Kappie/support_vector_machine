We washed up and changed, chop chop everything was done in 30-40 min (bear in mind we only had 1 toilet to share) and we went for breakfast. The buffet breakfast was in the cafe of Ankar Hotel, which was next to Ankar Hostel. The buffet was OK, but not fantastic. There was a small variety of sliced meat. We stunned some butter, sugar and salt, all essential for cooking in the days to come.   1000 hrs  Finally checked out of the hostel feeling filled up and happy. We took our own sweet time to walk to the train station. I tried calling home from here but I just can't. Don't understand why they don't seem to take ICC. Weird. Tested my overdraft by withdrawing more money. Success! I recall applying for an overdraft 2 years ago. Still seems to be valid.   1046 hrs  Norwegian rail system are so meticulous. They depart on the dot. Now we're on our way to Myrsdal.   1100 hrs  Reaching the edge of Oslo city. I can see the clear blue sky with less than 30% of cloud cover. The train ride (with the expensive ticket) is reputed for the scenic views it'll be taking us through. It was said that we should stay awake for the duration of our train ride to take in the sights. Daniel has already knocked out. He hasn't caught much sleep the last few nights in UK, preparing for his personal stuff and the coming Italy trip with his parents.      urlLink     Picture of a waterfall. This was one of the stops. That's Justin's head in front of me when I snapped my photo.  urlLink
