Most of the new problems are being taken care of, and some of the old ones are starting to be worked out. For example, the problem of having to live with  the beast . I'm starting to educate him to the better thins of life, i.e. - Resident Evil Outbreak. We're going in on it together this weekend. And adam and i have both heard rumors from the folks of moving. To a house. With bedrooms for the both of us. Happy Day! What we all want, i think..., is for adam and i to have two BEDrooms. With perhaps nothing more than a bed, a dresser, and a closet. The two bedrooms would be like so. x()x. The "x"s would be our rooms, and the "()" would be the bathroom. The rest of the floor of the house, would be a big room with a sofa, our tv and gaming systems, and the comp. Good, no? It works. Assuming that we can have a floor...I'm not trying to be a rich mofo here, really i'm not. Top floor of the house would be adam and I's...bottom floor would be the folk's room, dad's office, victoria's office, the living room, the dining room, and the kitchen. And their respective bathrooms. Life would be good then. Very good.
