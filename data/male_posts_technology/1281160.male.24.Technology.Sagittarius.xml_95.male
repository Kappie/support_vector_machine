Yeah, coming to my weekend, thought of washing on sat and sun to office... But... I slept very well in saturday that I postponed washing for sunday early morning.... But Saturday myself and uncle went for purchase... had a very gr8 deal of purchase at commercial...  Sunday slept rather less than saturday... but too its late for my office.. So I cancelled my weekend visit to office... and washed, cleaned our house for the vishu....got fruits etc.. kept infront of deepam...  today morning got up by 5.55 am... had a nice dharshan at Ayappa, Rama, Ganesha  Murugan temple... Finally finishing pooja at home and blessings from uncle,  Went to Cousins home and showered blessing for my neice.... Back to office.. and had some work... now a little bit free...  Cheers Ram
