As for absolutes, I think you (collective) have to have them to make decisions.  You either think something is right or wrong.  You believe something or you don't.  You think something is true or false.  I would bet that you (Johnathan) have more absolutes than realize, and that they help you form your outlook on life and opinion of things.  I think a strong leader has to see the world in absolutes, or else they are not strong.  Whether you agree with that leader is a reflection of your personal absolutes and how they compare with his (or hers).
