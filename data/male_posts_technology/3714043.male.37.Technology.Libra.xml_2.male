If by mere thought realities would change, time-lines shift, alternate lifetimes splinter off...  and nothing helps me indulge more in this fun thinking than the photo below.    urlLink    . urlLink     What if the fantasy could splice into the reality when most unexpected.  Isn't it fun to believe in the absurd and impossible even if just for a little while.  Haven't you ever wished you could go to Jurassic Park for real?  Visit a haunted mansion with ghostly apparitions flying about?  Watch a real UFO with brilliant lights and sounds orchastrated by John Williams come gliding out of the sky to land nearby to visit?  Fly at breakneck speeds through a busy metropolis wearing only a skin tight suit and a cape?  Zombie outbreaks... Magic Carpets... Interstellar spaceships... Time travel...  People wonder why I get so sad sometimes.  There's no ghosts in my computer terminal at work, no aliens landing outside my dreary office, no dinosaurs walking past the windows.  No gremlins on the other end of the phone... just upset customers with computer problems.  Sometimes I envy the coma patient who can live in the constant state of dream.
