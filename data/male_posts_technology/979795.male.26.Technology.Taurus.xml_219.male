Arhahahahaah!!! Some of them were so funny. I saw one guy making a funny face when Freddy Sensei was trying to teach him iriminage. And the last 2 clips looked like they were playing games. What on earth was that all about? Hmmm ... strengthening their arms, maybe?  Just had to make a note of this on the blog. Cute fellas. Oh yes, Ms Ng was inside in the background and assisting. By the way, who was doing the recording anyway?
