So far, I've read my morning email, vacuumed, dusted, cleaned a fishbowl, took a shower and took out the garbage. Exciting start for the day, hey? I do have to start getting to bed earlier at nights, though. I don't knnow why, but for the past week or so, I haven't been getting tired until 1:00 on the morning. Makes it hard to get up at 6am. I always say I'm a morning person but that doesn't mean I'm pleasent in the mornings. Just means I like to get up early in the mornings. Don't f**k with me until I've had a couple cups of coffee (Folgers) and a cigarette. The rental agent called yesterday morning and wanted to know if it was ok for her to bring the mortgage people up to my apartment this morning and let them see it. Apparently, this is an annual thing. They come and check out a couple apartments and take a picture or 2. I think it has something to do with assessing the depreciation or value of the building. I don't really know. I'm sure the rental agent selected my apartment because I always keep it so clean and have had many people compliment me on my decor. In fact, everyone compliments me on it. Several even say I missed my calling and should have been an interior decorator. I dunno. I can't see that as steady, good income. Besides, I can decorate my place so well because I know my "tastes" and what I like and don't like. I don't think it's possible to decorate for someone else unless you know them well. That's all for now. I may post again later today. Mom is coming down from her lake home for a visit and do some big-city errands and shopping. I expect her pretty soon, too. I love life!
