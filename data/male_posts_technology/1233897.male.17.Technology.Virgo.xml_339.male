The Seniors    The times you've left me with Are all but passed me by, And you go on with life While I sit here and cry.  Eyes will dry, tears will pass And my life too will go on. Until that time, here, now, My mem'ries I'll ponder on.  For none can know what lies in store,      'Save but the great Divine Through trust in Him I'll tarry on,      On 'till the end of time.  And you with Him I know I'll meet      If never again shall see, Past the last day of this summer      When I a Senior, be.    Yeah, um... I was sad.
