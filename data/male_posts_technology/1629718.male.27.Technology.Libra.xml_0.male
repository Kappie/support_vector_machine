I have $7.50 to last me for gas until friday...which i'm crossing my fingers that will be enough to get to point A and B.  Taking out a Loan to help things out hasn't done much of a lick to make life easier..and it seems all the bills are due on the 15th..yet another nightmare... I'm content and know that in a few weeks, everything will be straightned out...and money, will be at equal amounts, and maybe, I could survive on more better things.  Lena just called, seems I have to pickup my years supply of contacts today, my eyes are watery and it seems like i'm wearing the ones I have in my eyes out bad, but it'll be nice to see clearly , yet , once again. I head to LA on friday, which I'm not really all that excited about, but hopefully accomplishing one thing through the whole deal, and thats getting myself finalized and GONE from the X. Tired and sick of the thought of even having anything to do with her, more less taking part of her crazy lifstyle of constant bickering and cheap liquor in her front yard.   When I was growing up families had values, and you would do anything to make them work, but for that family, it seems like an endless task to make another $1 off of someone not wanting to be with your cheap, lame, ass. And collecting some more wellfare. I can't wait till she has to work, wait...the State will take care of that as well *shrugs*   Hmm dinner tonight sounds good, think i'm gonna hammer into some butter noodles or spegetti, misspelt, i suck..yes I know. As well as watch some tv, yank some jams outta the plastic box thats my proclaimed life, and sit and compromise about the situations i'm fixing to face.   I miss Rosie though, seems like the past few times we've gone places we've always had a blast, from Walmart to Taco Bell...it always seems like we're up to no good, and I love that! I miss it! :)   Well i'm finished yet once more...but for how long.... thats something we'll never know....
