It's not rocket science *energy consumed*   After a stunning migraine, and 4 hrs sleep I bailed on the 6:15am gym appointment, rescheduled it for 7am tomorrow, I've also got my business meeting tomorrow at 1pm, so all in all it should be a productive day, I'm also going to look at prepping the body of my car, doing some more laundry, and possibly redesigning a webpage. Then in the afternoon... hahaha.. yeah ok. I'd better keep some level of 'achievability' here. I'm thinking about taking secret 'me nekkid' pix at various stages of my weight loss, and body sculpting, as a gloat tool, later, when I hit my goals. Ahh yes but the downside is leaked flabby-sock pix.. hmm. Would I actually care? rah. I'll ask the moon, the moon knows all. What do I mean? well, I just went for a walk, and its a brilliantly clear night, I often look at the moon and ponder things. It usually helps me sort them out. It's great like that, our moon. I was debating the pro's and cons of caring about people, and things, and peoples things. Conclusion? I think it's more of an advantage than a hinderance to care more, rather than less. Anyway, time to sleep, prepare for morning. Wish me luck. Ka Kite
