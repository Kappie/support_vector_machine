Levine Â© dell'Autore   urlLink http://www.museosatira.it/1999/levine.html#i   I just finished  A Farewell to Arms , which is the second book in my personal Hemingway adventure.  I've really gotten into  urlLink Hemingway  since reading  The Sun Also Rises  in my Fiction class a few months ago.  Hemingway himself was much like the characters in his book. He fought on the Italian front in World War I, was a mean boxer, drank like a fish, patrolled the coasts of Cuba for U-boats during World War II, and hunted lions in Africa, who ran from him holding their tails between their legs.  Hemingway's life must have been more interesting than those of his characters.  Such a life would be fertile with stories, I imagine if my life were nearly as interesting I would have enough stories to write for the rest of it.  Too bad it's not.  I think perhaps I should spice up this blog a little bit.  Having now done some web development I think it would be a good place to play around.  I am doing some web work for an organization called  urlLink WildCanada.net , which is an online conservation organization.  The project will spawn  urlLink Actionworks.ca .  Organizations that promote social action share a common goal and therefore are a tight community.  The people genuinely believe in what their work and are more than willing to share their resources with each other.  This goes against all training I have received in Computer Science, where programmers are tools and their code is the product.  Corporate bitches is perhaps the correct term.  If the world really were a stage, then we would be the lighting technicians. Then again the A/V club would likley be more accurate.
