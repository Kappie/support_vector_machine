     
      Woke up a little late and had lunch with my folks at Cabo's downtown.  Hung out at the house for a little bit and then went down and visited Heather's folks in Spring and then we went to the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner for Kenna's wedding.  The rehearsal went fine and the dinner was at cafe adobe.  It was good to see a lot of my old friends, and more importantly to eat some good mexican again.  Holler!
