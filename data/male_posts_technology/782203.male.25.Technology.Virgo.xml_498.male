Thank god for the internet, without it I would have no social life. Or sex life for that matter. Hey cybersex is considered sex alright.   The Black Eyed Peas concert is in an hour but I ain't going. Cos I couldn't find anyone to go with. Where is the love I ask ya? Cos I definitely ain't feeling it.  Will be leaving for Shanghai on Sunday morning at 8 am on SQ 772. Just in case anyone wants to see me off. Anyone at all. I don't mind. I will be there by 6:30 am.
