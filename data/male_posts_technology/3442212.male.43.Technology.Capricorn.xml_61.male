Anyway: Today is  urlLink Canada Day , the day when a traveller needing a few essentials before noon in downtown Vancouver is out of luck, because downtown Vancouver is on a Sunday/Holiday schedule.  As I discovered last year.  This year, I'll be in Vancouver the 11th, which is an actual Sunday. But I won't have a morning bus to catch this time. Maybe a morning ferry, but it's not a top priority. I had this insane idea that catching a ferry to Nanaimo, driving to Victoria, shopping, catching a second ferry back to Tsawassen and driving to Seattle all in the same day would be fun. I am reconsidering.  All I'll really need is a good book store.  H'mm... There's a Chapters not far from where I plan to stay the previous night. That should do.
