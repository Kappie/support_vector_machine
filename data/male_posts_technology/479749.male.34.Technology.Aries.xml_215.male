When asked why he brought back the bunt, Augie noted that hitting a baseball is hard and that if you wait to congratulate a kid for getting a hit, you might wait a long time. Yet if the kid bunts, even if he makes an out you can boost him up by congratulating him on getting the bunt down and helping the team. In the long run, Augie feels this helps the kid to be a better player. I couldn't agree more.  urlLink www.TexasSports.com : "Augie Garrido"
