Look at that as a plus or a minus, but I found it amusing in this particular case.  The  urlLink Easy-Set Mole Eliminator  and the  urlLink Rodent Control Products  are waiting for us like an obedient dog.  Or an obedient watch-dog, in this case.  That's probably a topic worth exploring here, or somewhere.  Where do you people stand on this topic, vis a vis expressing yourselves freely in this forum?  Is that enough of a cause for concern to go to a different service?  It's the same technology that Google uses to put ads into your searches: Nobody reads your stuff (presumably; it would be awfully time-consuming), but our commentary is scanned nonetheless.  The article, originally in the Wall Street Journal,  urlLink "My Tivo Thinks I'm Gay"  explores some similar themes, long before Tivo announced that it had access to just how many times you paused and rewound to get a glimpse of Janet Jackson's  urlLink nipple shield .  So the question is, do we don tin foil hats and move on to a forum where we can suffer the illusion of privacy, or lay our thoughts and dreams open for Ashcroft's perusal?
