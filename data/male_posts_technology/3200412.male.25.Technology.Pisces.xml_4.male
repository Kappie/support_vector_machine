One of my first steps in bettering myself must be to improve the appearance of my home.  If I'm in an environment that is always in shambles, how can I expect to exert order and control over my life?    The first thing is to get the kitchen completely cleaned up.  This is probably the easiest task, and will only take me an hour or so to complete.  All I really need to do is one load of dishes, though I do need to fix the kitchen sink by replacing a washer in the cold water faucet as well - something that will have to wait until I can get to a hardware store, unfortunately.    The next step, and probably most important one at this point, is to clean up the front and back yards of the condo.  I don't have the equipment to do this though, so I'm going to need to convince my brother to bring the stuff over from my parents' place.  I need to get rid of all of the weeds in the garden out front, aquire a working sprinkler to attempt reviving the grass, and possibly lay some soil so that I can plant some flowers.  The grass hasn't grown enough to require an earnest clipping, but a weedwacking would do the edges some good.  The back yard is another story though.  I'm going to need to shovel up some dog shit, and the weedwacker probably won't be enough to take down the jungle weeds I've got growing back there.  It's going to be several hours of work - I've already set aside my Wednesday off to take care of it, but I'm not certaint that it will be enough.  I've got to get at least the front yard done by August 1st, according to a letter I received from the condo corporation.  It still really chaps my Libertarian hide that they even have the right to require such a thing, but I do agree that the yard is out of hand.    Once all of that is done, I need to start working on the bedrooms.  My own room is a sty, but that is mostly thanks to my wife.  Her clothing is spread all across her half of the room, and there's a stack of used kleenex on her side of the headboard.  I found myself thoroughly dismayed when I returned to the room in that kind of state after my vacation.  One of the spare rooms needs a fresh coat of paint and a solid carpet cleaning, as well as having all of a previous tenant's belongings emptied from it.  This is probably another day-long project, and I don't know when I'll be able to get to it - probably not until next week.    I'm going to start picking away at the back yard immediately.  I don't have the tools right now, but I can still shovel up the dog shit and try to clear away some of the debris that has accumulated back there.  It's not going to be fun, but it has to be done.
