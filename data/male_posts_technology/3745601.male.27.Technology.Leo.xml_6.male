Other than the 'pay us a million and we ensure you results' online rip offs, I've tried everything that I can think of to try.  It's really unfortunate as these are guys that I would love to see where they are at in their life.  It would be like a high school reunion without the people you don't want to see.  You know, I don't think it is possible to find people without hiring someone.
