Damm you Gwen i loved ya u know .....I'm gonna take the wallpaper of you off my computer when i go back to work on Monday!   Feeling really tired right now. Research is not easy i tell ya; it is terribly frustrating and tedious and sometimes its like (at the risk of sounding cliched) looking for a needle in a haystack. Wonder when I will get my hands dirty and dive into the actual grid stuff.  Hoping to go catch a movie or something in the weekend; really need to chill out and relax.   Check out this cool  urlLink Mind Reading  thingy , I was kinda puzzled about how it worked at first but figured it out after a couple of tries. (No its not something scary i swear)
