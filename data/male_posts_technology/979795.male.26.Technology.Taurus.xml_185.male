Just speaking from what I can rmember and my memories do jump around a bit sometimes.  Let me just start with a brief introduction of myself lah. Alternatively, if anyone out there is even remotely interested, you can visit my webpage at http://www.geocities.com/aylwintan1978.  OK, I don't want to, like, go really that far back in history (you can find that out from my website) so I'll just talk about myself now. Was from Nanyang Primary Sch, went to Buona Vista Sec and Computer Studies in Ngee Ann Poly. NS, was a M113 driver (no lah it's not a freaking tank lah) with 56th SAB, then disrupted to go UK for my degree.  Haiz, talk about my degree really need to be ashamed lah. I got direct entry in 2nd year of BSc Computer Science / Software Engineering. Didn't do well (that's an understatement, more like did really badly), so I had to take a year out to clear my resits while doing an internship in Singapore. I only just came back to UK 2 mths ago for the final year of my degree. Hope can still get my honours, even if it's a lousy one.  In poly I was very much into working out and physical training. Nope, I'm not one of those tanned and really fit guys you see out on the streets lah. I into working out for a tiring feel to stretch my muscles at a (turtle) slow and comfortable pace. My exercise 'kaki's in poly generally consisted of Ronny and Gary. We'd go for a run, then go to the gym first before jumping into the pool. Shiok, the pool ... my favourite exercise, swimming. Usually target to swim 1 to 2 km. No lah, not difficult lah. At a slow pace you can pretty much complete the distance.  Anyway, when NS came. You pretty much dun do anything but run and run. Plus there wasn't really much of an opportunity to to swim anymore. So there I was, panting and dying on the road. But I learnt to appreciate the feeling I get from running. I'm still a pretty lousy runner (aiya, can only get Silver for 2.4km in IPPT mah), but I happily volunteered for the Army Half Marathon in 2000. Really cham. Coz I overstrained one of my knees during training. Still, I didn't give up when it came to the actual day. I think it was either 12th or 16th km when I felt like my knee really hurt. Still half limped and half jogged my way to the 21st km finish line. I didn't meet my personal target for my timing though. But still, it was a very shiok feeling knowing I completed 21 km.  Anywayz, when I went into Uni. Went through a lot of stuff. Knowing more about people, more about myself. You discover a bit of your hidden strengths and weaknesses. You make some friends and you make some enemies. You become more receptive, more adaptable, yet still resistant to some kind of changes. You fit in and socialise, trying to widen your circle, only to find that you can also be a bit anti-social, and don't need anymore than a small circle of close friends. Yea, everything listed contradicts the other. But that's how it is. I suppose everything comes down to a right kind of balance between the 2 sides. Anyway, like I said, I screwed up my 1st yr of study (which was really the 2nd yr of the course) in UK. Did helluva lot of resits in Singapore and then proceeded back to UK for my final yr. I also met my current girlfriend in UK. Of coz lah, we didn't really get together till like last summer holidays.  We've got our own share of differences and arguements but so far things have been working out. At least I think so lah. Dunno what more I can comment on my relationship at this point.  Oooo ooo, now comes my favourite part, Aikido. Heard a lot about it long ago but never really tried it or really bothered to find out more about it. I started in University of Birmingham under Pauline Squire Sensei, 4th dan. She teaches every Wed evenings at the University. The Uni has this Active Lifestyle Programme that's really a cool idea. It is a very good way of introducing sports and certain activities to the students. They've got a lot of tstuff from martial arts, sports, aerobic-like stuff and even yoga. Fantastic. Anyway, I gradually went on to increase my training at Pauline Sensei's dojo, Po Rin Kan (literally translated as Pauline's House in Japanese). Just a bit of information. It's affiliated under the British Aikikai. This is sorta an umbrella organisation that has links to the United States Aikido Federation Western Region. And the USAFWR is under T.K. Chiba Sensei (hmmm ... should be Shihan right? I dunno), 8th dan. I've been reading stuff up on some Sensei's and from some of the stories told by Pauline Sensei, I would really just love to watch a class of his. I'm not sure if I can take or tahan one of his trainings though. Sighs. Anyway, I took my 1st grading (6th kyu) with Pauline Sensei and passed. When I returned to Singapore for my year out, I joined Aikikai (Singapore). Wah, I was so onz about Aikido that I increased my trainings from 4 to sometimes 5 days a week. 1 of which was a bokken course which taught me the really really basic stuff. At that time, my Sensei was Freddy Khong Sensei, 4th dan, who happens to be the club's Vice President. Bokken course was taught by Seah Ah Hee Sensei, 4th dan. One of my training class was usually conducted by Sensei Koh (Nai Sing/Seng I think). Let me just comment on their teaching styles. Pauline Sensei explains and tells the class what she expects from us when she teaches. It helped me a lot when I started out cos I felt like my hands and feet had exchanged places and had absolutely no way of co-ordinating myself. So telling me to shift this and do that was very very helpful. As I trained on, I found her techniques sometimes to be quite agrressive but she has mentioned before that she is really soft compared to Chiba Sensei. This also makes him sound a lot more scary and that's why I'd just like to watch a few of his classes instead of jumping right in. Hahaha :P Freddy Sensei is a quiet man. He teaches and leaves you to yourself. Of coz he goes around the dojo correcting the students' techniques and all that but he is a man of little words. Sometimes, I'm not sure what I'm doin is right or wrong. I guess when nobody mentions anything, it means its acceptable. Ah Hee Sensei has one of the softest technique I've ever felt. I especially like his kokyu-related techniques and exercises but juz can't comprehend them fully. Think his Taichi background is a reason for this. Sensei Koh also explains a lot when he teaches. Good if you can absorb them in. Sometimes I can't take in everything he says coz I'm concentrating on 1 small specific aspect instead of the overall. But I guess I'm juz a slow learner. Pauline Sensei's ukemi training is fantastic. I've not seen anyone teach ukemi in such a way before. She breaks things down into small parts that they are easy to execute and then bring them all together. Then she teaches different level/stages of ukemi and breakfall as you progresses. I really enjoy Pauline Sensei's class. Part of the reason is because they are usually small sized. She is able to give very personal attention on your own flaws. In Singapore, due to the large no. of students, I don't often get to learn what I'm doing wrong exactly. Sometimes I feel that I'm just going throught he motions of the what everyone is doing. I guess that's where my seniors come in, to help me out in this way. But 1 similarity among all the Senseis is that they all make you practice humility. In their own way, I am often reminded that no matter my grade or experience in training, I'm still learning. That's good coz I really really really hate to be on cloud 9 when it comes to Aikido. I would hate it if I ever get illusions that I'm a bad-ass martial artist who can kick people's asses and be some kind of martial expert. Still learning and reflecting daily, all thanks to Aikido.  OK I gotta go for lunch, so I'd probably finish this long entry in awhile.
