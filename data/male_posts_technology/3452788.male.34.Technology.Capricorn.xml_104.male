I actually left the office and am sitting in the local library so I can write blog stuff without feeling guilty. OK, so the 90 minute lunch is not good for my employment status, but fukkit. Maybe I subconsciously want to get myself fired. That would shake things up a little, eh?    I have a decided lack of creativity in my culinary repertoire. The last several times I have drove through McDonalds for lunch, I have ordered the exact same thing - 2 McTastes-Like-Chicken, a Fruit  Yogurt, and the extra-large diet coke for $3.85 (again, my body is a temple - for devil worship) . Today, I thought I would do something different, so I left off the FruitYogurt and paid only $2.78. Not only am I gastronomically challenged, I am pathologically cheap.    I had a spectacular poem I wrote from a dream, about crashiing into the ocean in my van. It was honestly one of the best things I have ever written. I am so pissed. I hope I find it.    I hate leafblowers. They symbolize everything that is wrong with Americans. They are loud, noisy, give off noxious gas, and they push one person's problems (leaves and dirt) onto someone else (my front yard) with little to no effort. Even worse ar those people who think they are too good to pick up their own fkn leafblower and instead hire illegal immigrants for $3/hr. How dirty would LA be without them??    Gas is too damn expensive. Behind the redwood curtain, it is 2.39 for unleaded. In Brookings, Oregon, it is 2.19, just as isolated, and they pump for you. At the Tolowa reservation in Smith River, it was 2.07 - no fed or state taxes for the tribe.     California sucks, I want out. Maybe I am a girlie-man democrat that has suddenly realized it is not so cool to have far-right-wing-Terminator as the governator.
