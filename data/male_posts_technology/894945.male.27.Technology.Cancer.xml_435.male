So, inspired by the glory of Chateau Toaster Files (Brett's palace) I decide to look into buying a place of my own. Nothing huge. Just somewhere that is fairly modern, clean. Somewhere to call my own that is not likely to fall to bits in five months, after a infestation of space weevils or something.   There are some quality places out there, but they are all priced for thirty-something rich divorcees! I don't know shit about parish rates, foncier rates, lawyers fees, insurance, stamp duty.. the list goes on, and on..   So while there are thousands of young people like me, looking for a start on the property ladder, we can't even get our collective feet onto the bottom rung without slipping off. Meanwhile the states are busy building stupid modern art bridges across the waterfront, big holes for water in the side of a hill and a FUCKING STEAM CLOCK!!! A STEAM CLOCK FOR FUCKS SAKE!!! While the hospital falls into disrepair and waiting lists grow longer and longer, thousands of young people leave Jersey because all they can afford is a cardboard box on top of Patriotic Street car park, and even that fucker costs them £80,000. Argh!!!!!!!!!!! *smashes keyboard on desk, throws mouse across the room and stomps out"  Sorry about that. If you tune in just for the soft core porn I sometimes post, here's a picture of a shaved pussy to make you feel better.
