She can't work saturdays cos she dances, she can't do after school because she dances, so basically she wants a holiday job that lets her leave at 3.30 everyday, and no weekends. hmmm. We started off in Hamsey Green, but no luck their, just a lot of application forms. We then walked down to sanderstead and we thought we'd got osme luck cos there was s sign in the bakers, but they said they'd already filled it, they just hadn't bothered to take the sign down! So no luck in the rest of the shops in Sanderstead, so we hopped on a bus into Croydon. Clarks said they take on holiday people which was good so we collected a form, and Clintons had a vacancy but it included a Saturday, so no luck. every other shop (Marks, BHS, Alders, HMV, Virgin, Waterstones etc etc) said they haven't got any vacancies till August/October/Christmas. Fun. So we then walked out of Croydon along the Brighton Road to go to 2 music shops, and no luck either! Collapsed into a bus stop on the Brighton Road, looked up and saw a restaurant had a sign in the window advertising for waiters/waitresses, so we went in as a last resort, cos she could do that as it would be evenings! The people in there were so nice and I got a free drink while I waited for her so I was happy after a long day! She got a trial, and then the bloke told me I could aswell! So we're both trainee Waitresses now, lol! Very strange day. Went all round the world, ended up with a job I didn't know I wanted, and then spent the rest of the afternoon in Selsdon Primary photocopying log books from 1955.  Can't be assed to go to IT cos I went yesterday and it was pants, so I'm going to do some revision of my own. Perhaps. Maybe tomorrow. Who knows?!
