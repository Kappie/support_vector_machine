I work so hard to keep my environment clean but all these fat yuppies are driving their cars causing global warming and a bad quality of air for me and especially future generations. I really think people need to get back on their bikes and start using their legs to get around instead of complaining about gas prices and being too overweight. Its really quite strange, in such nice areas like parks and sidewalks, they are hardly ever used and its almost a "rare" thing to see pedestrians now. Anyways I got a lot of homework to do right now so I'm out.  **PS: this is my first blog**
