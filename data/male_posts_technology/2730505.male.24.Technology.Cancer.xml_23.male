If Fed Ex and UPS were to merge, would they call it Fed UP? (what if FedEx, UPS and Emery Worldwide merged = Fed Up Worldwide)?  If quitters never win, and winners never quit, what fool came up with, "Quit while you're ahead?"  Do Lipton employees take coffee breaks?  What hair colour do they put on the driver's licenses of bald people?  I was thinking that women should put pictures of missing husbands on beer cans.  I was thinking about how people seem to read the Bible a whole lot more as they get older, then it dawned on me they were cramming for their finals.  How much deeper would oceans be if sponges didn't live there?  If it's true that we are here to help others, then what exactly are the OTHERS here for?  Clones are people two.  If a man says something in the woods and there are no women there, is he still wrong?  If you can't be kind, at least have the decency to be vague.  Ever wonder what the speed of lightning would be if it didn't zigzag?  Nostalgia isn't what it used to be.  If a person with multiple personalities threatens suicide, is that considered a hostage situation?  If a cow laughed, would milk come out its nose?  I went for a walk last night and my kids asked me how long I'd be gone. I said, "The whole time."  So what's the speed of dark?  Why don't they just make mouse-flavoured cat food?  I just got skylights put in my place. The people who live above me are furious.  Why do they sterilize needles for lethal injections?  Isn't Disney World a people trap operated by a mouse?  Whose cruel idea was it for the word "lisp" to have an "s" in it?  Since light travels faster than sound, isn't that why some people appear bright until you hear them speak?  How come abbreviated is such a long word?  If it's zero degrees outside today and it's supposed to be twice as cold tomorrow, how cold is it going to be?  -------------------------------------------------------------  TEN Best Things To Say When Caught Sleeping At Your Desk  10. "They told me at the blood bank this might happen."  9.  "This is just a 15 minute power-nap like they raved about in the time      management course you sent me to."  8.  "Whew!  Guess I left the top off the tippex.  You probably got here      just in time."  7.  "I wasn't sleeping!  I was meditating on the mission statement and      envisioning a new paradigm."  6.  "I was testing my keyboard for drool resistance."  5.  "I was doing a highly specific Yoga exercise to relieve work-related      stress.  Are you discriminatory toward people who practice Yoga?"  4.  "Blast!  Why did you interrupt me?  I had almost figured out a      solution to our biggest problem."  3.  "The coffee machine is broken."  2.  "Someone must have put decaf in the wrong pot."  AND THE number 1 BEST THING TO SAY IF YOU GET CAUGHT SLEEPING AT YOUR DESK...  1.  ".....in Jesus' name.  Amen."   -----------------------------------------------------------------------  A language instructor was explaining to her class that French nouns, unlike their English counterparts, are grammatically designated as masculine or feminine. Things like "chalk" or "pencil", she described, would have a gender association. For example: House is feminine - "la" maison. In English, of course, words are of neutral gender.  Puzzled, one student raised his hand and asked, "What gender is a computer?"  The teacher wasn't certain which it was, and so divided the class into two groups and asked them to decide if a computer should be masculine or feminine.  One group was comprised of the women in the class, and the other of men. Both groups were asked to give four reasons for their recommendation.  The men decided that computers should definitely be referred to in the feminine gender (la) because:  1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic.  2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is    incomprehensible to everyone else.  3. Even the smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later     retrieval.  4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending    half your paycheck on accessories for it.  The group of women, however, concluded that computers should be referred to in the masculine (le) gender because:  1. In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.  2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless.  3. They are supposed to help you solve your problems, but half the time    they ARE the problem.  4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, if you had waited a    little longer, you could have had a better model.
