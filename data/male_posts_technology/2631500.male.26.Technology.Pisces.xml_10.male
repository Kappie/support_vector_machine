Lots and lots of features for the power user. The sieve filters are very effective against the spam, in addition to the built-in spam protection. Not even a single spam reaches my inbox. A few legitimate mails doesn't reach my inbox because of the ads service providers like  urlLink Yahoo!  and  urlLink Hotmail  attaches to the mail. I'm a full member and even for the free member they don't add any big ads; just a text ad of their service. They have a very good  urlLink forum ,(I was a regular contributor to this forum, but I can't find time to contribute anything. Silly excuse!) with lot of users ready to help you at any time. Their support is also excellent. No complaints.   urlLink Gmail , launched in April 2004, seems to be an instant hit with the beta testers. Who will say no to 1GB online storage ?? But is it that good? I didn't like the screen shots posted on their website. It seems to be lacking most of the useful features Fastmail has. It doesn't have IMAP !! And it seems to be relying a lot on Javascript. Anyway, I'll get an account once the testing phase is over and accounts are open to public.
