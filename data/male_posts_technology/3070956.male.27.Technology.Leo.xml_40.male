He did. Cool.  He belongs to the Three Rivers Club downtown, and we work out together there from time to time.    Then, I booked my flight to Trinidad.  So, it's official - I'll be leaving on August 7th and returning the 12th from Newark, NJ.  Now I just need to hurry through getting a passport. uugh. I also confirmed my plans for the 4th of July - going white-water rafting with a group of friends... it should be an interesting first.  I hope to get some pictures somehow.  Today went very well with the software;  my customer is getting very excited and a progress keeps getting accomplished more quickly as my interns learn more. It's pretty cool for everyone.  Now that they started using it, they are able to give me a lot of good feedback about how we should enhance this early version.  At about 2:30, my friend Haris came over.  She's from Cyprus, which I found out is a  REALLY  small country on an island near Greece and the middle east.  The speak Greek in Cyprus.  She just graduated with her MBA from Carnegie-Mellon University and has had a hard time finding a suitable marketing job, so she's probably going back to Cyprus toward the end of June.  She doesn't know the area well and asked my if I'd take her to best Buy so she could by a video camera, I obliged gladly.  She came over, we caught some sun in my back yard, and then we went to Best Buy.  She bought a Scanner and Sony Handycam... seemed like a pretty good buy with lots of features.  I bought a Paralell-to-USB adapter and an larger SD card (256 MB) for my new camera. LOVING the camera - here's Haris out in my back yard:  Haris out back...  urlLink     After we were done, Haris left and I spent some time working and playing with my camera. My darn ISP went down for a few hours today and I was frustrated because I couldn't send e-mails out! My other friend Jon Cho wanted to go golfing and Heidi wanted me to join her at Kennywood park tonight, but I went a met up with Jon   picked up a bottle of wine while I was waiting for him. He and I had a nice workout, during which we got excited about grabbing dinner after at Dave abd Buster's and catching a mid-night showing of Spiderman 2. So after we worked out, we went to his place so he could change and I could freshen up. He's got a nice setup over there, inclding a sheepskin rug in the middle of his living room that somehow really works - I want one.  Jon's Place   urlLink     Then we went to the Waterfront to eat and catch the movie. We went to Dave and Buster's for dinner, then we hit the Grocery store - since I'm going to be in Pittsburgh for a while, it'll be nice to have some food around. We had a nice time just hanging out since we haven't for about 2 weeks.       VIP at Loew's... ahhh  urlLink      Start the movie already!  urlLink        The movie was great, but now I'm so tired now...  I worked my back pretty hard tonight, and I'm sure it's gonna hurt terribly tomorrow. uugh.
