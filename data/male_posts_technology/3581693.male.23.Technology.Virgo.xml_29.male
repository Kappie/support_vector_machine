The Roger’s phone providers  Yeah I guess they are alright But the Bell Mobile girls with the way they talk They’ve always got you right in mind  I wish they all could be Bell Mobile I wish they all could be Bell Mobile I wish they all could be Bell Mobile girls  The Bell girls have the best smiles Oh them girls are really swell I dig their leather cases and their car adapters Make my cell phone more worthwhile  I wish I had a bell girls digits There in my mobile phone Yeah cause then I’d call her I’d wine her and dine her I’d take her to my fav-or-ite bistro! (“That’s White Spot”)  I wish they all could be Bell Mobile I wish they all could be Bell Mobile I wish they all could be Bell Mobile girls  I wish they all could be Bell Mobile (Bell, Bell, girls yeah I dig the) I wish they all could be Bell Mobile (Bell, Bell, girls yeah I dig the) I wish they all could be Bell Mobile (Bell, Bell, girls yeah I dig the) I wish they all could be Bell Mobile (Bell, Bell, girls yeah I dig the)     - Sadly - the Bell girl never got to hear the song -  meh - c'est la vie!
