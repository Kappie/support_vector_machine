We get them for all kinds of repair issues, such as hardware problems, software problems, format  reinstalls, viruses  worms, and the ever wonderful 'Misc'. People don't generally get to see what we have to deal with on a daily basis. Thanks to Rod Shelley, you can see some  urlLink classic repair nightmares . From personal experience, I can say that some of them are rare...but some sadly are not.
