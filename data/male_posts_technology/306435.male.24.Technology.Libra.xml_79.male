I think the most facinating thing aout the place is how we were all so interested int he tv station that showed the  urlLink beam information  thorughout the night.  It was like watching a car wreck.  We played cards and had the Beam Station on.  I think Bill stayed up all night just making sure it didn't dip too much.  Anywat, Saturday night we walked aimlessly around town in freezing weather looking fpr a place to eat.  It was fun.  we eventually ound this little bar a grill called Govenor's.  It was okay.  Although I do know now why it is the windy city.  we rode the train into and out of town.  It was fun.  I took pictures and should have them up soon.  Sunday we went to the  urlLink Museum of Science and Industry .  It was way too big for the little time we had there.  There was a neat urlLink  History of Hip Hop exihibit    Ann and I scratched a few beats.  We also saw the  urlLink Human Body  OmniMax presentation.    It was very interesting.    We rode to and from Chicago in two twelve passenger vans.  We had one walkiw talkie in each and well just image the fun we had with them...over and out.
