It usually takes me a an hour or so to paint a room with a corridor, but this time it took me something like 5 hours! Maybe cause i worked like a professionalist or cause it has been a while since i last worked in painting houses. It was fun but i'm so tired, the final result was  PERFECTO ! My family were  stunned  by my work, it's the first time they see my work, so they decided they want to paint their room, change it's colors, style, bla bla bla.. Yes, you guessed, i'm the chosen one for the job.  Anyway, after i finished everything, i took a shower, cooked me a Chinese food, had an instant coffee, watched the news and that's all.  Maria went to Sharem Al-Shekh with Aleef and his family, except for Tony, he is in the US in Virginia with my uncle and his wife.. They went to see Afnan. God, it has been ages since i last saw him. He immigrated 14 years ago and never came back for a visit.. He has his own business and seem to enjoy himself.  I better close now, i want to read the newspapers, see if there is any action, read the career index, maybe watch South Park and go to sleep cause i'm soooo tired. I don't believe i will sleep cause i know that no mater how tired i am i cant sleep before 3 or 4 o'clock AM.
