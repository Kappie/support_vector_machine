Now if we can just keep the terrs. from causing another 911 we can all get back to work. I would love to finally get a better job. I have paid my dues doing this one. I will never, ever, ever, EVER give any company the slightest bit of loyalty for the rest of my life. From now on I look out for number one. Hey they showed their true colors when all the layoffs went down so they get what they gave. Fuck them! I will walk away from a project and screw over an entire team depending on me for another $1.00 an hour.No loyalty on more baby!
