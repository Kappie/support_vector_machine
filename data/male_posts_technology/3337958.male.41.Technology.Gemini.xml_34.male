A few thoughts:  1) Going to the beach with friends who have a two-year-old in tow, no matter how much you care for the friends, and how good the toddler is, is a  buzzkill .   2) When you're at the beach, a two-year-old child, no matter how badly behaved, can't bring your spirits down very much, especially if you don't have ultimate responsibility for the child.  After all is said and done, you're still at the beach.  3) Going to your own place, knowing where everything is, and having access to all of the alcohol in the owners' closet, makes for a great weekend.  You don't have to go out to for every meal, or even any meal, if you don't want to.  If there is a small child in the area, sometimes, you want to.
