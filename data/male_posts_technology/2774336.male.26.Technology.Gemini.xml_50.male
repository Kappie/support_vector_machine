 Today, I woke well but quite sore as if I had been doing a lot of exercising yesterday.  I can't think of any activity I would have done to make my muscles that way, so it must have been dietary.  I didn't drink very much water yesterday so maybe it's an effect of being slightly dehydrated. 

 I only woke at 11:30 today, on my stomach again which I'm still counting as a good sign.  I was a little sweaty again this morning even though I removed a large blanket from my bed. 

 After rising from bed I only had a very slight amount of gurgling in my abdomen.  I had a slice of orange cranberry bread, half before and half after my shower, followed by a large guzzle of room temperature water.  The water caused one large belch so far but it usually does more than that over time (especially when I drink a lot at once).  I'm not going to be home for the whole day today so I have to carefully consider my eating plans.  I want to eat most of my food in the early part of the afternoon and much less at night.  In this way I hope I can avoid a repeat of last night. 

  Update:  The belching is continuing at a low level, and I have a slight bit of pain in waves in my upper abdomen (stomach).  I'm going to eat some oatmeal. 

  Update:  I had about half a bowl of hot oatmeal 10 minutes ago.  I'm belching and bloating a bit, with gas, but the most distressing part is that the back of my throat is burning a little.  Is this acid reflux? 

  Update:  I've finished off the rest of the bowl of oatmeal now at 2:15 pm.  The belching and bloating is getting bad, but not debilitating yet.  I'm having mild cramps in my lower abdomen, and when I belch I can still taste the orange in the bread I had hours ago. 

  Update:  I've been feeling alright for maybe a half hour, fourty minutes now (its 2:45 pm).  I may be able to go see my uncle today afterall!  I don't think I'll eat for a few hours though.  The belching is still around, but not too bad.
