An excerpt:    Honor and shame trump everything in that world. A pithy sentence, eh? So instead, think about what it would take for you to kill your own daughter with a knife, with your bare hands, because she was seen in the company of a man not her husband or a relative? Think about that. Think long and hard. What kind of hatred and shame could drive a human being to do such a thing? What kind of pressures does that society bring to bear on an individual to make him capable of that? How different is their view of women, of family, of honor and shame? What would it take for you to murder your daughter with a knife, or a knotted cord Â with your own two hands and against her pleading, her protestations, and her begging for her life? If your response wasnÂt Âthere is nothing that could make me do that,Â then stop reading right here and get the hell off my property.  Multi-culturalists will respond that Honor Killings are not the norm and not representative of Islam and life under Shariah. We can debate the exact numbers of these horrors for days, but the fact remains that no matter how many individual cases there are,  there is de facto legal protection for committing these crimes.  When Islamic schoolgirls attempting to escape a burning building with their faces uncovered were sent back inside to die by the religious police rather than dishonor Islam Âwell, that is a brush that will carry a lot of tar.  (Emphasis mine)     Go read some brilliant essays. Then return and continue.   This seems to stir up my feelings of the recent bankruptcy declaration by the Catholic Church. The above description of killing your own child makes me physically wince much like I would expect any catholic (or human being, for that matter) to do once they hear of  another  priest/boy relations. Bankruptcy declarations, out of court settlements, public apologies...all these things marginalize the despicable behavior of these "disciples of God's word". Nothing but gut-wrenching shame should be displayed by the entire Catholic body for years and years.   But you say, "It's been blown up." "This doesn't happen very often, just glorified in the media." "These are just people trying to class-action legitimate sex abuse cases, which are very few and far between." Listen to me. It shouldn't happen  ever.  If it happened once, OK, one bad apple. Send him to prison. It happened twice, well, you should suffer as a collective entity. However, with thousands of claims against the church within the last 5 years, the Catholic Church should be viewed by red-blooded Americans with more disdain than that currently collectively held for the UN, France and Al Qaeda. I don't hate Catholics, but because of your recent collective actions, I reserve the right to deride you at will, and stay the hell away from my kids, or you'll bleed.   I'm surprised there aren't more off-color jokes circulating about the Catholic Church these days, with pedophilic abuses being their media forte. I've only heard one. If anyone knows any good ones, Email me.    There was a clever cartoon in the paper:  Some kids are in Sunday school, and one asks the teacher, "When Jesus loved the little children, did he go to jail?"   urlLink Here's another one that I can link.  --Bob
