When calling them today, I didn't expect them to have open appointments so soon. However I'm glad they do. The only thing worse then going to the doctor is dreading going. Also going to be tested for STDs. I have no reason to believe that I am infected, but its better to be safe then sorry. Heard horror stories about the actual test. Hopefully they've pioneered some less intrusive means of doing so. I'm not very optimistic on this one.  Also may talk about leg injury.  Maybe get recomendations for orthopedist.
