But something shocked me to the core a while back, and i am forcing myself to investigate. Blogs. What's all that about? Now come on, seriously, it beggars belief that the casual goings on of your average joes mundane existance can possibly be considered entertainment in these days of high techery and click of a button porn access. Yet, bizarrely, its a growing thing "they" tell me. its the future "they" say. well far be it from me to stand erect in the path of such an overwhelming force. If you can't berate them, join them, then berate them with the very thing thats makes them beratable (still with me? good).  So basically (though you will soon learn 'basic' and 'Kin' are words which normally dont get to meet up) i am going to do a blog that mocks blogs. Irony doesnt even begin to describe it. But! (and this is a Michelle McManus sized but) although i will be jumping on the bandwagon as the saying goes, instead of actually sitting on it and enjoying the ride, i will be holding a gun to the wagondrivers head and insisting he take me to the airport, and he best damn well have an airplane waiting for me, fueled up and ready to fly to err, umm, well just ready to fly dammit!  ok i'll shut up now.... Welcome to Kin Chronicles, its all downhill from here.
