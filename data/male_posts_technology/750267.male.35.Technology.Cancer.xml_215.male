This is something that has really bothered me for a while, and I'm glad it's coming to a head. The United States government has, since the attacks on September 11th, consistently trampled over the basic human rights of tens of thousands of people. There were more than 1,000 people held in jail for more than a year after the attacks, without charges, some without access to a lawyer, some without access to their families, and all without access to the evidence... The vast, vast majority have since been released without charges. But how would  you  feel if you were put in jail for 18 months, without being told why? If even you had access to a lawyer, the evidence against you is classified and so you don't even know what you did to end up in jail. I don't suppose the U.S. government apologizes when they release you after all that time...  And what about the people in Guantanamo? Again, they are prisoners of war when the war is supposed to be over. The United States is treating these people (not all of them soldiers) as bad as the American POWs were treated in Vietnam. Isn't (former POW) Senator John McCain upset by this?  Let's not even talk about the prisoners being held inside Iraq and Afghanistan. Or the prisoners being held on board U.S. Navy ships in the Persian Gulf. Anyone remember that big #3 Al Qaeda terrorist the U.S. captured six months ago? He's disappeared - never to be seen again I suppose.
