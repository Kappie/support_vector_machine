The warrior of light sometimes behaves like water, flowing around the obstacles he encounters.  Occaisionally, resisting might mean being destroyed, and so he adapts to the circumstances. He accepts without complains that the stones along the path hinder his way across the mountains.  Therein lies the strength of water: it cannot be shattered by a hammer or wounded by a knife. The strongest sword in the world cannot scar its surface.   The waters of a river adapt themselves to whatever route proves possible, but river never forgets its one objective: the sea. So fragile at its source, it gradually gathers the strength of the other rivers it encounters.   And, after a certain point its power is absolute.      The warrior of light cannot always choose his battle field     The warrior of light cannot always choose his battlefield.  Sometimes he is taken by surprise in the middle of battles not of his choosing, but there is no point in running away,  those battles will merely follow him .           - Paulo Coelho (Manual of the Warrior of Light)
