So I signed up on match.com the other day. My profile is shyguy1177. In case anyone was interested in looking at it. When I was testing out some of the features I accidentally sent a "wink" which says that you're interested in meeting someone. It was just the person at the top of my list. Turns out she has kids living at home. It was a little awkward, me telling some total stranger mom that I liked her. I think if I were testing match.com, I'd have them put in a confirmation or something.  Well, I'm off to see the dr. today. Evidentally diabetics' eyes have a tendency to go bad, so I need to go see an eye dr. I hope my new glucometer comes soon.  Anyway, enough of my randomness. I'm going to go shower now. Peace-
