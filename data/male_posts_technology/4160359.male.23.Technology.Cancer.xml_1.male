She did the same to avoid hitting him.  I hit my brakes but they failed.  We were only going like 20 MPH, so it wasn't anything to worry about as far as injuries go.  Her Kia Sorento got an inch-long scratch in the bumper.  My entire front of my Ford Escort from bumper to first set of tires turned into an accordion.  Completely crumpled.  My air-bag went off.  Some sort of fluid was leaking.  I think they said later I had a cracked block something on the inside.  Needless to say, repairing the car was out of the question.  It was scrapped and I was given $3,000.  So, Girlfriend has this 'great' idea of buying an old clunker and fixing it up.  I was just going to go buy one that was already functional.  I'd probably have one within a few weeks.  We are currently going on 13 months of "NO Car for Me".  Originally, I was told that it would be ready by Halloween at the latest.  Then by Christmas.  Then I stopped getting a due date.  Now, for some reason, I am apparently the bad guy in this situation.  I am the evil person who is impatient and who needs to just back off because I ask whats going on with the car once a week.  I don't know how this happened.  When did this transformation occur?  What is it that Girlfriend sees different than I do?  I see myself as the guy who has been patient for 3 months, then 6 months, then 12 months, and is still continuing to be patient.  She sees me as a jerk.  I'm pissy about this.  I have a right to be impatient since about 6 months ago.  But I wasn't impatient then.  I am even paying for everything.  I have just this week started to be impatient.  I figure patience hasn't worked for the past 12 months.  If the situation was reversed, she would have lost patience after 3 weeks.  But I'm impatient.  Fuck that.  Next time I get accused of being impatient, I'm going to lose it.  I'm going to explode and tell her that she's damn right I'm not patient.  I was patient, but I'm not anymore.  I've redefined patience with this situation and I've raised the bar of patience to new heights.  If Patience was an olympic fucking sport, You would hear my national anthem playing right now as I graciously accepted the Gold Medal.  But no more.  I'm done with patience.  I need a car.  I want a new job, and I need a car to go to interviews.
