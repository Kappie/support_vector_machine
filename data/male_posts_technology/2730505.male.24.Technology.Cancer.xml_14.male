I was in the middle of locating this fucking port last week when I realized that it was time to leave.  I knew this coming into the week and I was actually excited to go back to work and work on the bigger pieces of the pie.  I got to work and worked through the mundane requests that people had me do and deliver my normal reports to the sales supervisor so that she can do her job.  I then decide to go back and locate that damn port from last week.  I spent an hour and a half looking for that thing in my wiring closet and finally I found the fucking thing.  It was very rewarding that hard work pays off.  My good feeling was short lived because I then tested the cable and it had some fucking wire that were shorting out (probably because during the pull, it scraped of a piece of metal and pretty much was damaged goods) so I had to talk to Greg Y. and he helped me out with a plan to use the pairs that weren't being used and "swap" them out to just make it work and not make maintenance pull a single cable (it takes a long time for that shit).  So we did but by the time that I had it all figured out.  It was time to build a box for our new engineer so that AUTOCAD 2004 will work on the damn thing.  So I did that shit for a while and now my backups are taking too damn long and I have to stay here at work for a little while longer.  Oh well, it isn't too bad.  I get to listen to my ghetto music and get caught up in what has happened during the day while waiting for stuff to finish.  I then check my yahoo email for new mail because for some reason I was expecting and email from a certain someone.  I really don't check my regular mail since people I know usually email me at my work email or sprint email.  Low and behold there it was.  The email I was eerily expecting.  Now I said that I was feeling better and all that shit last night and I was, but I wasn't -completely- feeling better.  With that said, I think I will go play some Top Spin tennis at Derek's house and have a couple of brewski's while I'm at it.  As I wait for the last tape to be dismounted in the backup server, I gather the tapes that need to go in so that I can check them in and get myself checked out of work.  Yeah this was really just me rambling for a little while.  I felt like I had to talk to someone but at the same time I didn't want them to say anything.  Just venting you know?  That's it for now.
