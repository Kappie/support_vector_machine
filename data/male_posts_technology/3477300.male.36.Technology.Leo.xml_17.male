The wife almost had me take him back to the pound on Sunday night.  I'm not a dog person, so I don't know what's good and what's not.  But his current list of shortcomings are:  	-	Taking food off the table 	-	Pulling hard at the lead on walks 	-	Barking at (and trying to chase) squirrels, birds and cats 	-	Barking at anything that passes us while we're in the car  The latter woke Ben up from a sleep which was something that really pissed me off.  I was ready to throw him out of the car as we drove along the freeway.  And I can open that trunk from the driver's seat, so he needs to watch out! :-)  So Lucky is now on probation.  We plan to get some training - doggy and parents - to see if we can get these problems fixed.  I think he's on a timeline though!  He needs to get fixed before too long!
