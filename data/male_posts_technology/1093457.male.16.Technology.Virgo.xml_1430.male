All brought from WHSmith and since November! I shall be buying the Scary movie box set when I get payed as I can't afford it until then. I'm working tonight and so am bunking off last lesson, I'm then working all day saturday...  Means lots of money when I get paid! Yay!  Nicki about the cinema, when do you want to go? Just chat to me on msn or something...  I won't be on the internet much tonight as I'm working till about 8, won't get home until at least 9pm... Then I have a exam tomorrow, so will have to revise. Of course I probably won't revise...  Parents have got tickets to Wimbledon, so they have gone off there today. But I think it will rain so they probably won't see much play, which is a shame really as the ticket are quiet expensive. I heard they are seeing Venus Willaims and some other well known dude. I just can't think of the name right now. there is also some other random person that knocked Hennman out of the French open so they are seeing some good amtches considering its the opening day. they are on number one court I belive so that's also good!  Well. that's my blog for a while. Blog agin in a few days/ weeks!
