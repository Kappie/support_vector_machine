Not with the results but with its simplicity and the fact that it was literally under my nose. It wasn’t hard to re-trace my footsteps until I realised that the answer was with me all along. My soles were in my shoes. Bugger, didn’t I feel a bit silly?  I also feel a need to reply to custards post. Custard, You don’t post for ages and then when you do, you insult us by not bothering to type four letters! I mean what the hell is “1st” and “u” How much harder would the extra two letters for two words be for you? FIRst and YOu.  I understand the laziness lexicon when using mobile text messages simply due to the length allowed and requirement to use ten number keys for a twenty-four letter alphabet. But for someone to type a message using a standard keyboard for the internet, especially someone who has broadband I fail to see why this is an issue. Its just me but it’s a pet hate.  -Jackass any good? -You think computer game, I think toss one off. Who is worse here? -Whats a relationship? -Custard is single. Has time to devote to computers. -You’re a geek with a nice car -I haven’t been out properly either for ages. -Sunbeds are not the work of the devil, One piece bathing suits are though… -Will Saturday be any cop? Is the gang all going out? -Will Andy talk to me considering I *still* haven’t gotten round to replying to my E-mail.
