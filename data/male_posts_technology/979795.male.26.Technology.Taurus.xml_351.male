But it could be because there's a lot of last min stuff that needs to be done or at least made presentable before the Minister of Education's visit to the school coming Tues. Goodness, I know Tracey (HoD IT) would like to present something on eLearning during the visit but I'm hoping I can do something light then instead. Still not sure I feel up to it at such an early stage.  I've been working on getting the IT notice boards up past week. Took me 2 days later than intended to finish it up. Basically I put up some minor content (after amending the language to suit primary school level) and surfed around for cute pictures to be placed on the board too. Well, I decided on Neopets. Seems like a craze of sorts with the kids these days. They do look kinda cute lah but I got no idea what those creatures really are. Most look like a cross between 2 different animals, while others I got no idea what they really are. But it catches the kids attention. While pinning it up on one of the boards, some pri one students started crowding around behind me and they just went "Oooo, so cuuuuute." o_O"... I dunno if it's a girl thing lah, but when I sat in one of the classes Daphne (resident IT trainer) was conducting - MS Publisher -, some girls presented their final work. When pictures of animals or pets were shown, they just went "Ohhhh, so cuuuute" again.  Well, my friend Tang informed me of a Ministry of Home Affairs career fair this weekend. Will be meeting him for lunch before we pop by together. I know SPF isn't recruiting but there's no harm taking a look either.
