It's a constrained medium, and finding a shape with the pieces you have is sometimes even harder than sculpting.   LEGO also is one of the few unconstrained gifts you can give a child, where the playing field is truly only limited by their patience, imagination, and number of pieces. Whoever becomes LEGO's new MasterBuilder becomes an educator, his decisions affecting the chlidhoods of many. Lets hope the new Master Builder realizes this, and acts accordingly. And lets hope more kids get legos than get GI joes this year!
