If you are satisfied with the nadional democratic alliance and support all the hard steps taken by AIADMK government in ensuring financial stability and uniform growth among all sector of people ,if you want them to continue in power  VOTE FOR BJP/AIADMK alliance(which is a natural alliance).   if you are not satisfied with the performance of NDA and still believe that DMK and alliances who where with BJP till yesterday and blamming it as an religious party today,a party with a symbol of rising sun and with a policy of rising son and rising grand son ,a party which always beleive that acting against Hindu beliefs is called as secularism, can give better governance along with Mrs.Antoniyo meno of ITALY ,then kindly vote for thier alliance.   always note that inspite of all critisism and blames Tamilnadu has almost reached the first position in all sectors as promised by our CM.   also note that Majority can not be right always.   ready for further discussion    Note: Kicha : - can you please copy this mail and put it in blogger for me?
