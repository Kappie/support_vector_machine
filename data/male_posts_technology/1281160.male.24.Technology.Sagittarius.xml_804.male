Pitha Magan  i do agree what sri told. everyone acted very well.  as sri told, if u take scene by scene, that movie is really superb, in each scene everyone acted very well. if one scene vikram acted very well then in the next scene sivamainthan overtook him and at the end of that scene laila come and make her mark. so if u consider the entire film as scene by scene, sure everyone ll like it. this movie will score high marks, if it is shown in SunTV super scenes.   by this time everyone could understand what i m trying to say. yes it is. if u see it as a entire movie, then from the next time u wont go for anyother Bala's movie. Psycho paiyan, kevalama padam pannirukkan. i went to this movie on the very next day of deepavali with my sivakasi gang. this is not only our comments, this was the comment by most of the people who saw with us. everyone murmured only like that.  bcos i took my bike out of the theatre and waited for one of my friend in the roadside, one family came out of the theatre also stand nearer to me and waited for someone. everyone in that family gave similar comment like what i told, then my friend arrived there and told "dei machan oruthan intha padam supernnu solranda". then uncle(head of the nearby standing family) told "yaaruppa appadi solrathu, antha punniavanna konjam parkanumnnu sonnaru".  bala took this movie for only the five or six persons whom sri mentioned. he gave them a very good chance to act and they too did well. but if u ask what is the story??????? nothing is there? its very boring? and u cant imagine a girl like laila from a village. family girls can be bold, but they should not fight with rowdies in the road.  reg. vikram character - u can not imagine a person like him in the real life. bcos he was not born and brougt up in forest, but he behave like that.  i can appreciate only one thing, that is surya's acting and characterisation, both are good. apart from that nothing is there in the film. this is only my view, but u can consider this b4 going to that movie.  but my friend in chennai told that Pithamagan is a box office hit. so it seems more people hav Bala's view, if suppose u have Babu's(hihihiiii myself) view then dont go to that film.
