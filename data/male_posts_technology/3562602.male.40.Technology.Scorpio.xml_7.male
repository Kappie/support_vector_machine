Something about finding your path with God as the guide.  I took an unexpected nap but managed to mow the back lawn and wacked the weeds.  I meant to go out to get something for dinner, but just ate what was in the kitchen...cheap steak and a big salad.  I've bought some paint to paint the kitchen cabinets.  I gotta get on that before I leave this weekend to see the family and go to the beach.  Back to work tomorrow.  I'm somewhat uncomfortable with the script writing, but I'll get better as I have to write more.  I've got a good job now.  Not much pressure.  Just learning about the systems and apps.  Anyways, a simple day.  Another tomorrow.
