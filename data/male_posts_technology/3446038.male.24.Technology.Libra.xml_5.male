I have posted many others for people like you but this one goes out as homage to  urlLink Holden Caulfield .  If you are reading this then you probably know what a blog is and in all likelihood you'll have one of your own. You often wonder that why your blog isn't as popular as some of the other pretentious bastards on the net who have got nothing else to do but brag about their stupid mundane life or voice their opinions about things that they can do nothing about. Then why do you do it? The simplest reason for this is the fact that as humans you are craving for attention and have a belief that you are the centre of the universe. You give too much importance to yourselves. You are part of a generation that has been raised by television commercials to run after things which do not make much sense but are a status symbol in the society. The whole fuss about a 1 GB GMAIL account all over the tech savvy community proves it.  I know that you are lying if you say you never wished for a GMAIL account. In all probability you would have mailed your friends for it, contacted complete strangers requesting for it, posted petitions on various blogs, yahoo groups and orkut communities. Just look inside and try to answer to yourself,   "Why do I need a 1 GB email account? "  I doubt that the most common answer will be something other than  status symbol .  Why is it that you can’t accept the harsh realities of life? Why is it that you are always looking for other people to approve your actions? Why do you  give a fuck  to what other people say about you?  I reread this post and changed all the  WE s and  I s to  YOU s so that it makes a better impact. I am also a part of the same ostentatious world you live in and think like you do. And if there are some people who are still looking for GMAIL invites, mail me your full name and email address, I have got 5 left.   urlLink My Blog
