It might be a problem at blogger's end.  Also as blogger is providing a free hosting space in its domain, we are allotted only one page space. That's why we are not allowed the facility of uploading images, Ranjini.  If we require the option of uploading images onto the blog, we have buy some space. For more information, read the FAQ.  Rini, your cooments on the story are appreciated. I'll mail you later about them. I had just come in when I recieved your mail.  BTW, I got an increment of 1K yesterday.   Bye, Jax.
