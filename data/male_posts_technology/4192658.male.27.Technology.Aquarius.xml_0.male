I have not been able to decide until now if I like this concept of meeting people for matrimony purpose or not. My mixed emotions after these meetings are primarily based on the kind of time I have had in those meetings. Yes, each meeting is unique in itself, and will fall in one of the following categories.  - Traditional meetings where you would be asked to visit the home of the girl and you would be seated in the living room, wondering why is the girl taking so long to come and participate in the rhetoric conversation that parents are carrying -	Meeting the girl and family members in hotel’s lobby -	Girl’s parents coming over to your home to meet you before they can allow you to be seen by their daughter -	Girl’s guardian’s coming over to meet you outside. -	Meet the girl herself over a cup of coffee. (Rare, v-Rare)  Although I am very take_it_easy kind of person but I am not sure why am I not able to find these meetings funny. (Oh My Gawd … what happened to me ?). I think it has something to do with not agreeing to the concept of arranged marriage. Although, I don't buy the concept of arranged marriage but as of today, I do not have an option.  I find it difficult to consider someone for marriage just by making forced conversation for 15 - 30 mins while everyone around expects you to talk to the girl ( I don't know what do they expect .... but they all have that look in their eyes... Arrrgggghhhh..)  And ... I wonder how difficult would it be for those girls who are stuck in that situations, I am not sure if we are living in 21st Century. Anyways .... I still hope to find someone ...
