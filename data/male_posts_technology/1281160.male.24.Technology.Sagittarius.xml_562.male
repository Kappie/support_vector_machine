Xavier, the color scheme is a good idea.....it was nice too.....guess it would be better, if the post's font also changes to that color(with a slight variation in the shade....a darker shade).....I shld try one of those sofwares Xavier....thanx for the info......i'll surely disturb u, with all my inquistive(??!!) questions, when i try them........   abt the new members....as u've mentioned earlier...any of our batchmates are invited......on one legitimate condition..... we are a group of "INFORMAL FRIENDS"......we, by all means, have all the rights, to tease, kid, josh, banter, fool around(ivvalavu dhaan enakku theriyum!!!) in a nutshell  "play with each other"....... for instance, if i say that Vijay is a  loose mental , Rajesh is an  Aan asingam  or even Ganesh is a  maramandai , nobody is going to take that seriously.....anybody joining us has to accept this...hope u guys agree with me......  Hey Rini, saw ur photos .....u look gorgeous......  Vijay babu, nobody's going to critisize, abuse, upbraid, berate, revile, rail, grumble, dress down, reprimand me.....podhuma???(Xavier, plz don't try to find any fault in this....aedho oru enthu....dictionary.com la irundhu "cut, copy paste" pannitaen). BTW, do u have beef????.......what's that beef rice?.....  yep Kavi, i know the whereabouts of Anitha, courtesy: a few of my UG friends......kishore, nee konjam late pa.....vacancy filled....nee olunga un kayathukku marundhu pottuko(ulkayam, velikayam ellam dhaan)  bye
