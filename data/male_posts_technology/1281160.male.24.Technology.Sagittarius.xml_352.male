I call it preliminary, because some may still have some plans of doing some course (as Valli does), but the fact that we are PGs lends enough to justify that we are done with the requisites. Having gone through so many phases what do u feel of our education system.  Dr.Ravichandran, once told in our class that "we are NOT serious about education" because if we were really serious we would atleast make sure we are inside the class before it begins... And we know how we did our MS degree...   My question is, "Does college-time non-serious laid-back activities have any significant impact on someone who really has the potential to make it big"... Can we say that every person WILL reach the maximum extent to which his potential can take irrespective of how/where he/she studies. Political factors have a major influence often.. but what apart from that... Is our education system really flawed...
