I dont see this as being a bad thing, but it gives a bit of insight into a few things. When I grew up, the friday night activity was rollerskating, not roller blading, I used to watch MacGyver,  Knight Rider, Automan, and HappyDays was on at dinner time. I think the 80s were the mature 70's.. like maybe the 70s were societies teenage years , carefree happy-go-lucky, the 80s had everyone realising that family is important, but so is individuality.. I'm thinking the 80's are kinda like being 21, time to start owning up to stuff, and now? beyond 2000? old age.. everything is doom and gloom :) Doom.. doom 3 is out, a run around and shoot everyone computer game, and a damned nice one, at that, unbelievably atmospheric, something a lot of dime a dozen fps'rs lack. Cool. The original doom I guess is something many of you dont remember.. I remember trying to get doom to connect modem to modem, directly, which was largely not done, way back then. So ph33r, and ph33r me lots. I'm more g33k than you ;) A stunning blonde tourist looked me straight in the eye, smiled and said hi today, I tripped on my words, then on my feet muttered something resembling 'hi' and blushed off into the distance.. Nice one don juan. Great. The chick on the seat infront of me kept preening her hair in an indicitive way, and kept sneaking looks at me, I dont know, and probably never will, if it was because I had a booger hanging out of my nose, of if she thought I was hot. Hah! hot, I got called hot the other day, I expressed my disbelief to a trusted friend, who reiterated, instead of sharing my dumbfoundedness. Gutted. The last thing mr ego needs, is to think he's hot. Ahh well, must be the MacGyver hair ;) go the 80's. These days are ours, all summer long. xoxo
