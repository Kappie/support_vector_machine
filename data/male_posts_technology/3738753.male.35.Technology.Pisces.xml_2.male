It's early Friday morning and the thick warm air is filling my small bedroom on the second floor of my parents split level house.  Outside it's much cooler, but I like the confines of my room.  That is how I have been feeling lately.  I retreat into my room where it is warm and safe.    I feel as though someone has kidnapped my heart and didn't bother to leave a ransom note.  I neither have the location nor the possesor.  I know I shouldn't feel this way.  However, my mind does not allow me to escape its torture.  I am not afforded the opportunity to repress my feelings and I am forced to face them.  It seems like most of my heartache and heartbreak has happened to me during the summer months.  Maybe it's the scorching heat.  It could be that summer living is supposed to be easy and I am more susceptible to these things.  That's probably why I hate the summer.  Bad memories.  Bad lies...  These days I reminisce of days past.  I find myself doing that often now as I grow older and as I struggle through tough times.  We tend to do that when we are most vulnerable.  I think about my early days of marriage.  Although it was difficult under circumstance, I felt close to my wife.  She was my best friend.  We would talk for hours about our plans for the future and share pieces of our past.  It was like discovering a whole new world that you had only heard about.  She would always like to surprise me by planning a special getaway or my favorite meal.  Those are the things I miss...  My thoughts drift to the future.  I see a blank canvas for me to paint my masterpiece, but I have no paint for which to create it.  The brushes appear frayed and dried out.  Then I realize, you never really start over or start with a clean slate.  There are always those haunting memories which stain your canvas.  The only thing you can really do is paint over them with new images and new colors.    My Dad has cancer.  Once you verbalize those words, they become real.  The reality of it all becomes clear and all your fears consume you.  I haven't been afraid in many years.  I made a conscious effort to not let anything scare me years ago.  Even if I was, I never let anyone know it.  I don't let many people see my emotions.  That makes me too vulnerable.  Even now, I can't show my parents I am scared.  It is my time to be strong and to support them as they have supported me since my birth.  It's times like these that a man needs a strong woman to stand by him and make him stronger.  It is a burden I must face alone now.  It will only make me stronger, but I know it will also cause me to bury my emotions deeper.  Bitter thoughts of regret.  I have always told myself never to have regrets.  They are a waste of time.  It's all a lie.  We all do whether we tell ourself or others we don't.  But if I really had regrets, it would make me ungrateful.  If I regret certain things in my life, my life wouldn't be quite the same.  One minute detail would severely alter my path and everything I am now might not be.  If I regret meeting the mother of my child, I wouldn't have my child which brings such joy to my life.  If I regret getting married, I wouldn't have the memories I am so fond of and are comforting to me now.  All the people which I have developed relationships with, whose paths I have crossed might not be.  They all serve a purpose, each and every one of them enriching my life in some way.  Awaking in the morning is the best time of day.  For those first five to ten minutes of the day when your mind is clear and the worries of the previous day have evaporated is the most peaceful.  I especially enjoy those moments these days.  The pain of being without my wife is but a fleeting memory.  It's when I realize she is not by my side that the pangs begin and my day starts.  Like most morning pains, you have to slowly arise and they subside.  My creaky heart is heavy and I know that in time it will become lighter and heal.  There is nothing that can describe the feeling of a failed marriage.  There is something heavy on the soul about it.  The pain comes from deep within your bosom and a sickening heat radiates from within you.  It consumes you and weakens you.  The loss is almost mournful as you try to forget, but the echoes haunt you, the sounds pounding deep within.  Some days are better than others.  At times I find myself wandering aimlessly about.  No real direction, just letting my feet lead me as they may.  Some days a ray of hope fills me and I feel I can move my own way.  That is always quickly subdued by reality.
