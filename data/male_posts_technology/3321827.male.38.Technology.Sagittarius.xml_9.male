First off, non-citizens have less vested in the future of our country.  They're here to invest in themselves either through education or work.  For example, they can work here on their H1-B Visas and leave when their work is completed...they can line their pockets and go back to their native countries wealthy people.  There's no personal investment in the future of our country.    Secondly, it will allow terrorists and those friendly to terrorists the ability to vote.  Many of the 9/11 hijackers were here legally...on student visas....and would have been given the right to vote.  Would you want people who are the enemies of our nation the right to vote in our elections?  We have enough enemies here on the left.  Finally, the right to vote is one of our most fundamental rights as citizens.  It would cheapen the electoral process by demeaning our privileges as citizens.  I'm not denying that immigrants have been and will be important to the growth of this country.  But if they do really love this country let them apply for citizenship and become citizens before being allowed to vote.
