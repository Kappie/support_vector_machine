Yeah that's the one. Well people who drive all the way up that and then push in the queue really hack me off. Obviously their time is more important than anybody else's. Basically it's called selfishness. #2 What is even worse are the selfish people who run red lights. Today, I had to wait two seconds while my light was green, because of idiots who kept going through a red light. (It wasn't as if it were short phasing either!). Not only is this selfish, but it is dangerous. So the person who does this is saying, my time is more important than your safety (and possibly life). Sick. Well it hacks me off.   On a more positive note I wasn't angry all day! I worked from 7:30 - 5:00 with two 15 minute breaks. I was pretty tired at the end. My shift was supposed to finish at 3:30, but the work just kept coming in. I am finding it really challenging, and really hope it will get easier once I'm familiar with things. I feel quite useless at the moment, and to cap it all off, I'm on my own tomorrow, after only three days training in micro. AAAAAAARG! Well at least time goes because there is so much interesting stuff to do.  Jono Camp came around tonight. He is doing the devotional period for youth group on Saturday night, so I was giving him a hand to construct his talk. We had a good time, and managed to fit in a wee bit of counter strike.
