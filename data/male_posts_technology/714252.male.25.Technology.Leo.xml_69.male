I remember the exact moment I decided to go for it. I was having lunch with two friends who had already blazed the trail to cue ball city. One of them - a notorious giver of nicknames -- referred to my old hairstyle choice as the "pink yarmulke." That pretty much sealed the deal.  The most shocking thing about getting a buzz cut (I didn't go all the way) is that you suddenly realize your head is much smaller than you ever would have imagined. I've developed a sudden fear of ping-pong. Unfortunately, my ears, nose and glasses stayed exactly the same size thus giving me a Mr. Potato Head look that I hope will one day become fashionable.  On the plus side, I find endless amusement rubbing my head with my hand. You would think I'd get bored doing that, but you would be mistaken. That's why it's taken me so long to write this newsletter; I'm typing with one hand.  I try to resist rubbing my head, but I don't have the willpower. I tried to cut down from two hands to one. That worked for a few days, but the next thing I knew I was slipping off a shoe and trying to get a foot involved. It's a small problem now, but I'm afraid it's like a gateway habit, a stepping-stone to worse addictions. I'm already eyeing other parts of my body and wondering how that stubble would feel. It's a sickness, really. _________________
