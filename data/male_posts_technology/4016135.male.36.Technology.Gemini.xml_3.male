To balance out the seriousness of that movie, last night I decided to watch one of the great icons in American cinema: Showgirls.  Almost everyone has a guilty pleasure and mine is Showgirls (and Hudson Hawk, but that's another story). I don't really know why. Yeah it has enough T and A to desensitize even the horniest teenage boy. Maybe it's because Showgirls is one of the most ridiculous, brash, loud, obnoxious, and vulgar movies ever released. It's so bad it's good.  I already own the original DVD release that came out several years ago. It's a decent disc, but it's pretty light on special features (other than the wall to wall nudity) and the video is non-anamorphic widescreen, so viewing it on a widescreen TV isn't all that great. So, I was pretty excited several months ago when I heard that there would be a special edition coming out. Not JUST a special edition, but a VIP special edition. I was getting horny just thinking about it. Not only would it come with the movie remastered in glorious anamorphic widescreen video, it would also include some sweet goodies like a couple of shot glasses, a deck of playing cards, some glossy picture cards that double as drinking game instructions, a blindfold, a couple of tassled pasties, and a poster of the spunky hero Nomi Malone (Elizabeth Berkley) with which you can play pin the pasties on the stripper, er dancer. All that for the low, low price of $29.99. I am SO there. Anyhow, this cinematic treasure was in-store yesterday (July 27) and of course I headed to the local Best Buy to pick it up. Yes, I actually bought it and wasn't ashamed to be seen carrying it up to the cashier.  Cracking open the package at home later that evening, my wife was floored that I would buy Showgirls again, othwise know as double-dipping.   "But honey, it's a SPECIAL EDITION with REMASTERED VIDEO! And look at all the cool stuff you get! Pasties!!!"  Okay, so she was less than impressed. Actually, she seemed more interested in playing with the baby. I guess Showgirls is one of those things that women just don't get, unless they're an actual Vegas showgirl or a stripper or a lesbian...or a combination of all three.  Okay, suffice to say I would be watching the movie by myself. I settled down late in the evening in anticipation of the spectacle I was about to re-live. Now for those people out there who haven't seen Showgirls, and there are a LOT of you, the plot is deceptively simple. It's a rags to riches to rags story about a young ambitious girl who wants to be a star in the garish glare of Las Vegas. Ah, but there's more than that. The movie also includes: endless, relentless full frontal nudity, lesbian kisses, revenge, dancing (if you can call it that), glitz, glamour, a brutal gang rape, stripping, lap dancing, a sex scene in a swimming pool that has to be seen to believed. Hell, it even has a scene with  TRAINED MONKEYS . My wife and I have this running joke that if a movie has any sort of scene with chickens in it, the movie has to be good. Chickens are one thing, but having trained monkeys in a movie takes it straight into the stratosphere of movie greatness. Trust me on this.  Watching Showgirls, one has to acknowledge the special effort put forth by Elizabeth Berkley as Nomi Malone, our mercurial stripper turned "dancer". Before Showgirls, I knew about Berkley from the old kids show, Saved by the Bell. She was pretty cute on that show, but in a wholesome sort of way. From what I recall reading just before the release of Showgirls, Berkley really wanted to re-invent her image as something other than the cute Saved by the Bell chick. Oh boy did she ever. To describe her acting in the movie to someone who has never seen it before is pretty straightforward. It's angry acting. Every movement, every line, every smile, every dance step is done with NO subtlety at all. Just watch her dance moves. Every movement is accompanied by an angry grunt. Unhh!! Ugh!! Agh!! It's like being given the most aggressive lap dance you've ever had, not that I've ever done anything like that (ha!). The infamous sex scene in the pool deserves special mention. Berkley gets it on with Kyle MacLachlan in a way I can only describe as a dolphin with an epileptic seizure. I swear, she was thrashing around so hard it looked like someone had just hooked her, reeled her into shore, and needed to release her...QUICK.  It's interesting that a movie like this really should have destroyed the careers of all those involved, yet for the most part all the major players seemed to have moved on with their careers. Paul Verhoeven, who fought tooth and nail to get Showgirls made, went on to do Starship Troopers and Hollow Man. Not the best track record, but at least it's work. Kyle MacLachlan went on to do mostly TV stuff. Gina Gershon went on to do many other movies including the excellent Bound, directed by the Wachowski brothers, before they hit it big with the Matrix. Poor Elizabeth Berkley. She went on  star in a bunch of movies no one has ever heard of let alone seen, with the exception of Curse of the Jade Scorpion, the Woody Allen movie people may have heard of but nobody saw. The one guy who seems to have gone down the toilet career-wise is Joe Eszterhas who wrote the screenplay for Showgirls. I guess Hollywood didn't exactly agree with Joe's ideas of what is erotic in movies. It must be hard being a mysoginistic, sexist, woman-hating bastard writer in Hollywood.  One final mention about the Showgirls DVD. I actually started out watching it with the regular audio track (in glorious Dolby Digital 5.1 sound). About 45 minutes into it, I was curious about the audio commentary track included so I switched over to it. Unfortunately, the commentary was not done by Paul Verhoeven or Joe Eszterhas. A pity really. I would have loved to hear their serious take on their masterpiece. Instead, the commentary track is done by some writer/uber-fan of the movie. What makes it enjoyable though is that the guy throws out comments and one-liners that make it sound like an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. There's some great funny stuff in the commentary and it makes an already classic movie even more enjoyable.  So at 2am after finishing the Showgirls spectacle, I sat there wondering what was it about that movie that I like so much. I won't deny that there is a certain naughty appeal about seeing all that boob action, and Elizabeth Berkley's acting is so over the top you can't help but watch in that horrible train wreck sort of way. I guess I like Showgirls because it's made so badly that I'm constantly amazed that it takes itself so seriously. It's unintentionally funny. I do understand the serious moral and societal themes that Verhoeven was trying to address, but I just can't help but laugh at him and his pompous attempts at social commentary. I think there should be a  lesson in film school where you're taught that serious dramatic themes should never be utterly obscured by an endless barrage of T and A. Of course, how can you not like  a movie with the classic line, "Must be weird not to have guys cum on you". That, my friends, is quality screenwriting.  I just hope my daughter never gets any crazy ideas about running away to Vegas to become a showgirl.
