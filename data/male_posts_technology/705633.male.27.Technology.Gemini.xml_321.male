Anyway, on with the show.......went out last night with Toaster and Custard to see Princess Kate and the reknowned Andy. I was a bit worried as always to go meet a girl that I've never met before but she was totally cool! As I have said before, I only know a few people from Canada but they are all cool hehe. We all watched a film at Kate's (Save The Last Dance, for fuck sake lol, only joking) and had a general chat. Then Kate, Andy, Toaster and I headed into town to All Sports for a few drinks. Once again to my horror I saw Danger working behind the bar and this time he was dressed as a god damned zombie!!(I dunno, the things you do to get noticed mate!!!) Oh well, it was Halloween. After All Sports Kate, Andy and Big T headed to Follies, I however needed to go get some sleep for work (sorry everyone). I appreciate what PK said, I am 'Hard Core' hahahaha! I aim to please. Well hopefully all of us are going to the Splash tomorrow night (jumps up and down with a large grin) so it should be a cool night. Thats it, times up, got to go out now...  Baity signing off.............
