I have dated my share of okays and maybes, but have yet to date someone that makes me want to spend my life with them.  One thing that always seems to get me is the girl's name.  It sounds superficial and probably is, but if a girl has a bad sounding name I just cant make it work.  Here is some examples of names that make me go Ughhh!  In no particular order:  Rhonda, Linda, Debra/Debbie, Sandra/Sandy, Bernadette, Patricia/Patty, Gilberta (yup, that is an actual name), Amanda, Annette, Andrea, Billie, Tracy, and many more I can't think of at this time, but as I do I will add them to the list.  Here are some names I love.  Again, in no particular order:  Anna, Anne, Lindsay, Summer, Laura, Lauren, Stephanie, Carrie, Alisa, Emily, Jennifer, Jessica, Ashley, Brooke, Madison, Angela, Shannon, and more I am sure.  I will add to this list as I remember them.  Even though this sounds really picky it isn't as bad as it used to be.  I used to only like names that started with A, S, or L.  Now, I have a better understanding of something... who knows what though.  Now my two favorite female names are Kayley and  urlLink Annalise , but I will use those to name my daughters.  So, I will not be looking for a wife with those names.  Leave a comment with the female names you like/dislike the most.
