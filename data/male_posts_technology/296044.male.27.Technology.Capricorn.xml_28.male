All was going well until Tani and I determined that we had to do something with the noodles before we actually layed them together with the meet and cheese.  So we decided to place each stip of lasagna on to paper towels in order for them to... to...  I'm not sure why we did it.  But nontheless it was interesting.  The lasagna turned out great!!  Good job T!  Went on the Roving with Susan and Josh on Saturday.  For those of you who don't know, the "Roving" is this get together that the people in Josh  Sue's area have every three months.  J  S's area is up and coming, so many of the homes there have recently been bought, gutted, and remodeled... or in some cases, the gutting had already been done.  Anyway, three homes that have recently (or sometimes not at all) been remodeled are volunteered to be showcased during the night.  A group of people then go roving from one house to another to look at what's been done, talk to the owner's, get home ideas, and generally just mingle with the neighbors.  Each person that goes on the roving is required to bring some beverage for them to drink.  J  S and I brought wine (as usual).  And, again, as usual each home we looked at was old and gorgeously remodeled.  And huge.  It makes you both want to do something like this with a house of your own, and at the same time seems like such a daunting task that you never want to undertake it...  oh well, it's fun to see anyway.  We all then went back to J  S's where Kyle and Jody came over and we all sat around a small bonfire in J  S's back yard.  :)  Gotta go work now...
