This girl that I know Margenna and her boyfriend came over and I made Veal Parmesan for the first time, and it came out good but I had too much sauce in it. They also brought some red wine, I had some, afterward my stomach was pissed off at me, so much for wine.. I guess the sticker on My meds actually know what it's talking about! :)      Well tomorrow I have to do a reset on the water filtration area, So I am gonna go to sleep really soon...       talk to ya'll tomorrow      lates!
