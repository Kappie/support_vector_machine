It doesn't help that I began work today at 4:00 AM and I have no one to talk to!  I am working early because the third shift guy had to leave early.  Actually, other than the loneliness and that theme song it is not that bad.  No calls come in until after 6:30 AM and I look like the good guy for coming in.    I finished my big "clean out the closet" project this week.  I sent four trash bags of old clothes to work with Ann.  She said it was weird seeing people wearing my clothes.  It is also a lot easier to find things in my closet now.
