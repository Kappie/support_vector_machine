Nothing more than I need to mention here, except that if you know me, you know I have a big disdain for professional sports.  I usually never watch them, because I'm not convinced its a great investment of time and I think we as a culture have a slight problem with the way we treat atheletes and the amount of money we spend on pro sports.  Please understand, I'm not taking shots, just reflecting how I personally feel.  But despite all that, I watched the whole game, and it was quite a game.  Kudos to the Pats and the Panthers on some good competition.  Read what Walt Mueller says about the Super Bowl  urlLink here , find the heading "Lettin' it all hang out...".  Very good critique.  "I am fully aware that those who would be critical of my criticism will say I should have just turned it off. Sorry, but that's not the answer. I may not have watched it, but millions of other impressionable young kids will have. I think we need to be advocates for them and protect them from physical, emotional, relational, and moral harm."  Go Walt!!  We can't engage or dialogue if we hide from it...
