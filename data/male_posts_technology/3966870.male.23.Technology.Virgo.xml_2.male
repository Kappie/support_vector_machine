I am really torn between slackware 10 and SUSE 9.1 I will hopefully make my choice before I format. I am also going to be only updating my blog at night as I hope to soon have a job working for Dell in the service department here in the new place they opened up here. So wish me luck!    "Dell Service Center"  "My Dell blow up"    "Dude you should have BUILT THE DAMN THING YOURSELF!" lol    laaaatttteee
