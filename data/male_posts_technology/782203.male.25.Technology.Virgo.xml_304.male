There is a     urlLink blues festival  today and tommorow which I would really love to go to but got no one to go with.  Note to myself: I need more friends.   Today was my dad's birthday and we went to this nearby kopi tiam (coffeeshop) for dinner, it was a pretty low key affair. Thank god it wasn't as awkward as it was the last few years when my mom will kept pestering me to wish my dad 'Happy Birthday'. I guess this year she finally gave up.  Thank you god.  Found a 24-hour Hungarian porn channel on the net, ok one more thing to keep myself busy with when I'm at home on weekends !
