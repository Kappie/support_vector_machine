  Web portal Yahoo will begin offering "virtually unlimited storage" for  its paid e-mail customers and will upgrade free users to 100MB, an executive  said Thursday.   
  The upgrade is part of an overall enhancement for Yahoo Mail that will launch  this summer. Besides additional storage, the service will get a face-lift and  tie in more Yahoo-branded services, such as Photos and Messenger. 
 The announcement comes a month after  search rival  Google  said it would launch a  free e-mail  service  called Gmail that offers 1GB of storage, considerably more space  than free versions of Yahoo Mail and Microsoft's Hotmail. Yahoo currently offers  4MB of storage to free users of its e-mail service.
