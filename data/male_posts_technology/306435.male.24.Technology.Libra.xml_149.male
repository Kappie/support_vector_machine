Then I read that Kristin and Greg are moving to Murray.  Now Justin has taken a job in Chicago.  He leaves next Sunday.  I guess it was fun living with him for 22 days.    This means Tom and I are now looking for a new roommate.  Good news is Ann will be in town in two weeks for Jeff and Devon's wedding.  I am excited to see her.  It seems like it has been ages.  This weekend she is on a river trip.    The basball team is doing well, but the league is taking a beating with it raining the past four Sundays.  The Mavs are 1-2 and we will probably have double-headers the rest of the summer.
