I just finished my last turnover meeting, which means for all intents and purposes, my work here is done.  Actually, I don't have a freakin' thing to do. All the real friends I've made on this project left weeks ago, so I think that's why I've been in a funk. Tonight, I'll try and play some pickup ball at the Y and maybe work out. Maybe it will make me feel better.  Richmond, though it had a pretty bad reputation, has turned out to be a pretty good thing. I got to stay at the Jefferson. I walked to work downtown every day and never got shot at or mugged or anything.  I found some places to eat I really liked. Mama Zu's for Italian. Hana Zushi for Japanese. Beyond that, I don't need much else. Plus the client folks have been good to me here, and that goes a long way. We've been through a lot and come through it pretty well.  Anyway, its probably stupid to miss a place I've been trying my best to get away from. I guess that's just how I'm wired up.
