The groups photo album, right now is divied into three directories:   2003  Memories  Wedding Snaps  The classifications seems good and based on functionality. (This is Xavier, the Information Architect speaking.)So what are a few wedding snaps doing in   2003 . They should be within  Wedding Snaps . Since 2003 is almost over, snaps being uploaded in 2004, must be put in 2004.  I have made the necessary changes. Photos of weddings (including engagements) are now present in the  Wedding Snaps  album. Hope you don't mind it.  BTW: In case you didn't know, ROASM is updated everyday. Rini, as you had requested, it is now present in the blogroll.
