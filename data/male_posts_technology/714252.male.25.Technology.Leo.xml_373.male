I'm coming up to my 25th Birthday and I was wondering exactly how far through life I am now.. So I went looking and found  urlLink these life expectancy statistics . So it turns out if I was born in 2002 I would have a life expectancy of 75.1 years..  I then went searching again and found the excellent Death Clock site(!) which let me build  urlLink My Personal Death Clock   So.. Turns out I am due to expire on Wednesday, October 9, 2058.  That means I am one third of the way through this old life.. I better get cracking eh!
