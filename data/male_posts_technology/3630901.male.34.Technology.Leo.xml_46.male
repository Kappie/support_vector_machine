I made salad dressing (oil, vinegar, minced shallots, honey, and dijon), to go with a salad of mediterranean greens, pear, honey roasted almonds, and gorgonzola.  I stopped at the liquor store for a bottle of red wine.  I had no idea what to get because red wine is not my favorite, but P likes it.    When she arrived I gave her a quick peck on the lips and then we got our stuff together and found a shady spot to sit.  We sat on opposite sides of the blanket and started to place food between us.  All throughout the meal I thought about how it was a physical barrier.  P brought cheese, crackers, and fresh fruit.  All of it was delicious and made for a good meal.  We talked a lot about careers, continuing education, and possible future careers.  I did not particularly like the wine, and I don't think she liked it much, either.  After we had finished eating, we had about 15 minutes to spare before needing to leave for yoga.  That wasn't much time for anything romantic.   Lessons Learned:   sit side by side and array food in front of us, choose a beverage we will both equally enjoy, don't plan an activity immediately following the picnic.  Yoga was good.  P changed in the bathroom while I changed, unabashedly, in the living room -- V was already downstairs getting ready.  It was just the three of us.  The only downside was that when we were doing meditational exercises, I started to drift off towards sleep.  After yoga, V said that there would be no tea / fruit, because she had dinner plans.  So P and I went back outside and she showed me some pictures of her bike trip to ireland.  After the pictures, we kissed - with tongue, passionately.  Did I break it off?  Could it have gone towards something more?  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure if she wanted more.  But I was sure that I didn't want more.  I had decided, maybe sometime during the evening, or more likely even before the date, that I really wanted S.    When I got home, L was up and we chatted a little about the date.  Then I checked my email and re-read notes from D and S.  I decided to give S a call.  I called her at home and her sister said that she was out.  My heart skipped a beat.  I called her cell phone and she picked up after a ring or two.  She was on her way home from a friends house.  We chatted for 30-45 minutes, and firmed up plans for me to come to her place for a date tonight.  I told her that I wanted to sleep over, but that if she felt uncomfortable, I could sleep on the couch.  I went to sleep thinking about her and about my camping trip that will start on Saturday, instead of Friday.    No ambien again, I woke around 4, feeling very horny.  A raging hard-on.  I just lay in bed, thinking about S, enjoying the hard-on, untouched.  I haven't masturbated since Saturday, which up until then, could be considered a long time.  After I had talked to Sue, I was no longer interested in masturbating - I wanted to save myself for when I was with her.  During our phone conversation the night before, we had danced around sex talk without overtly saying it.  She referenced her dirty mind on more than one occasion.  She had said that if I slept in her bed, she didn't know if she'd be able to keep her hands off me.  I can't remember the last time someone said that about me.  So.  I'm looking forward to tonight.  I'm not bringing any protection because I'm disease free and infertile.  If she's not, well then that introduces a problem.  Regardless, I don't want to make any assumptions ... in fact, I think sex would confuse things or make me feel like we're in love.  Because for me, sex = love.  I think it's that way with a lot of women, too.  I also believe that sex = commitment.  I also believe commitment = monogamy.  I'm not sure where "fooling around" goes.  I packed up stuff for the camping trip, deciding not to bring my stove - I figure I can boil water on someone elses stove, for my chicken teryaki meal.  And I'll bring sandwiches.  And I'll bring some hard cider and of course, water to drink.  I'm a little nervous about kayaking on the river.  I'm a little nervous about camping and being with co-workers.  I'm a little nervous about not sleeping well.  I'll probably take an ambien, just in case.
