Chris Sabo bobbleheads to be exact.  Well we got there too late as they were all gone, only going to the first 10,000.  As we were walking up there were people leaving with three or four in hand.  I hate those people.  Anyway we got in and sat with Sam Stephens and a fw other people.  The game went three innings when the rain cloud of death showed up and rained for anhour straight.  We left and the game continued a hour and a half later.  The Reds won in the 11th with Boone's second HR of the night.
