So we are all here at City resturant for the new years eves celebrations. It is a timne to reflect and think about the year that has gone, and lok forward to the year ahead. So far we have been talking about sking and snowboarding incidents, the time I fell off a chair lift and the time that Kirk wrestled a crocdile to death.  Anyway, I'm going to sign off now. Wherever you are i wish you a happy new year and all the best for 2004, when Toaster Files will be back  - bigger, better and drunker than ever.
