Recently, however, I've discovered the joy of flossing, the sensation of getting the glide floss inbetween each tooth, making sure the floss goes completely into the gum next to each tooth, and then the satisifaction that one gets from seeing the plaque and small food items that appear after each crevise has been attended to.  As I write this entry my mouth craves the attention it recieves from a good flossing.  The clean feeling that you have afterwards is almost as good as right after getting your teeth professionally cleaned at the dentist, and then being able to run your tongue across your smooth clean teeth.  I've noticed that I usually get more debris (plaque, etc...) from the top teeth than from the bottom, which goes against what one would logically think since gravity should pull the food to the lower teeth.  If anyone knows what the reason for more food debris being on the top teeth, please share it with the rest of us avid flossers.    My flossing environment (mouth) is somewhat unique, I've got a capped baby tooth that requires special attention when flossing, and unfortunately it looks like I'm going to have to have braces to straighten it out before I get it removed and get an implant (I've been told that I should go the implant route instead of getting a bridge).  I'm concerned that braces will put a serious damper on my current single/dating status, but I guess I've gotta just bite the bullet and get it over with (braces aren't cheap either, so I'm not looking forward to that).
