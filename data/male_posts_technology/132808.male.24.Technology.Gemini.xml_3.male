And the weird thing: under time zone, it lists Canada - Saskatchewan for central time.  Well, I'm not about to rep tractor pulls, combines and fucking your sister, so to hell with Saskatchewan.  I looked for Canada - Manitoba, but couldn't find it.  But I did find America - Winnipeg.  That's messed.  Unless, of course, they were talking about Winnipeg, South Dakota.  Oh, BTW: Coastal's Law?  It's just like Coastal's Love, baby: Hard and Fast
