Despite a dismal and depressing "performance" at the Saddledome for Games 3 and 4, Calgary has bounced back with a vengeance to secure a 3-2 lead in the series and the chance to send the Sharks packing as early as Wednesday night.   Extreme Makeover: Blog Edition  You can't help but notice the changes  "Musings..."  has undergone in the past few days... Thanks to the recent improvements in  urlLink  Blogger  , I was inspired to adopt a whole new look and feel for the page, along with a little info about myself. I wasn't too sure about the picture, though... I thought it might make it seem too much like a Personals ad and, although that  is  how I met my girlfriend, I have no further interest in  those  kind of hits! Also, I'm afraid I had to ditch all of the comments left over the past few months, since I opted to use  Blogger's  Comments feature instead of the old  Haloscan . Anyway, browse around and feel free to let me know what you think. Especially check out my  urlLink  BlogRoll   if you have the time...   Drool On My Pillow  I had a  very  strange dream in the wee hours of the morning today. I dreamt that I was out shopping with a bunch of people, some that I know, one that I know but never hang out with, and at least one celebrity, though I can't remember who now. Anyway, as we were about to leave the store, I decided I wanted a pack of gum and began searching those little racks of candy and chocolate bars they usually have right beside the cashiers. My eyes landed on a  huge  pack of  urlLink  Bubblicious   in a yellow package with red and orange lettering... The flavor was  "Strawberry Orgy Coffee Bean" . I couldn't believe my luck! Another caffeinated gum! I ran out of the store to show my friends, thinking all along that I couldn't wait to write a blog about my find. So, what is more disturbing? My obsession with caffeine, my obsession with blogging, or the use of the word  "orgy"  on a food product???
