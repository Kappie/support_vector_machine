I am a fairly new cat owner and was browsing through my local pet store when I noticed your product.  I read the back and noticed that it promised to 'completely eliminate odor', be 'dry to the touch' and last for a month without being changed. At the time I was using conventional wood-chip cat litter and a litter tray bag, which I would change every few days. I didn't like the way that my cat would walk the cat litter through the house and having to change it so often, so I decided to buy a couple of bags of Freshmagic and give it a try.  The first week or so went well, there was no real odor (I remove his solid waste daily) but it still seemed to be walked through the carpet, but I didn't mind the little crystals as much as the wood-based litter.  At the start of the second week I noticed I noticed a vague smell of cat urine and that the little crystals were slightly yellow which I assumed was to be expected.  By the end of the second week the smell of cat urine was very strong and making me feel rather ill. So I decided that I would swap out the entire tray after just two weeks. Upon opening his litter box (it's a closed box - I respect his privacy), I discovered what can only be described as a river of cat urine running through his tray. The smell was indescribable, I felt like my face was melting. I ran to the toilet and threw up.  After three pairs of rubber gloves, about five rinses with the shower and the best part of a bottle of bleach, I dried his tray out and replaced the cat litter with a new bag of freshmagic as it was all I had. Two weeks later and I had to repeat the procedure.  My cat has renal problems so doesn't urinate as much as a normal cat, so I can't imagine how anyone could survive a month using freshmagic.  I'll be buying a large bag of wooden cat litter chips tomorrow and a pack of bags. It costs half as much as your product, lasts twice as long, and I won't be suffering from post traumatic stress afterwards.  I won't be purchasing your product again, nor recommending it to any of my cat-owning friends.  Regards,  Adam Currie
