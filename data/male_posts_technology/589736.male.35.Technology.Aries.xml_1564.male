Sheiks walkin' around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose rings, Deciding America's future from Amsterdam and to Paris And there's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.  Man's ego is inflated, his laws are outdated, they don't apply no more, You can't rely no more to be standin' around waitin' In the home of the brave, Jefferson turnin' over in his grave, Fools glorifying themselves, trying to manipulate Satan And there's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.  Big-time negotiators, false healers and woman haters, Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency, All non-believers and men stealers talkin' in the name of religion And there's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.  -Bob Dylan, natch.
