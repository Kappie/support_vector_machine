Yay, Monday morning and I can sleep for an hour in the common room! I was not impressed on Friday. My Eng Lit lesson was crap, I nearly fell asleep. Its one of those teachers who talks in the same flat tones. AAAAAAH! Then I had a free so I did some school service. Then I had textiles which at the moment I hate. The teacher was treating uslike year 7's, don't talk when I am, don't talk you should be doing your work etc... She also said that when we bring in fabric we HAVE to share it, like if someone asks to use some of yours you give it to them. Nope. I'm not. I don't have much money so anything I buy I am using myself, they can go buy it themselves. I mean for textiles and art so far its already cost me £10 for the 4 sketch books. Outrageous. I don't see why I should supply the rest of the class with fabric.  Anyways, I still have one more piece of textiles to do so chal.
