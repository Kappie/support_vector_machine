I mean, I'm sure that if I were to totally burn some bridges, then I could say whatever I bloody well want to say on my own damn blog. However, if I only burn some bridges, but not others, then the unburnt bridges might  urlLink spontaneously combust . Which sucks, because I like one bridge in particular a lot, but since that bridge has its own problems and God only knows if bridge repair technicians (medic!) are on their way, then I'm pretty much forced into keeping my mouth shut.    But I still think someone needs a good amount of verbal abuse hurled their way.    And that's pretty much all I'm allowed to say about that.
