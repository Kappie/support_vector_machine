Yay for that. I was interested in finding the reason(s) why Friday the 13th is considered so bad. Seems like it has something to do with the Pope (at the time) ordering the execution of the Knights Templar on Friday the 13th of October, 1307. And also something about Jesus dying on a Friday, and 13 being considered unlucky back in the dark ages because there are 13 menstrual cycles per average woman per year. Umm. Yeah... Personally, so far nothing majorly icky has come in the way of turning what may turn out to be another average weekend from happening. Sept 11 came and went, people bitched about America and Iraq and the fact that jelly babies taste naff when they're all melted. Whatever. Me, I'm just avoiding everyone and everything today. Traditionally, Friday 13th's  have  sucked, for me at least, and today is unnerving because  it isn't sucking . I keep getting the feeling that someone's gonna burst into my office demanding some or other explanation to some problem I'm not aware of, or something. Pretty much doing the turtle thing right now, just praying that 5 o clock arrives ASAP, and that those who'd have me eviscerated today for some or other frivolous  triviality  are blind to my existence, just for a few more hours... Invisible Office Man, signing out.
