So over the next week or so look for me to be moving to  urlLink http://www.harshkarma.com , and my cafepress shop with lou inspired tshirts will also be linked. All I need to do next is find a good utility that can pull photos from an email account and ftp them to my blog and I'll be set. So email or add comments for your recommendations fo software, for the time being I will stick to blogger to drive the blog cause I'm really happy with it, but in the futue I may go to MT, or dare I say it ... a full fledged cms like postnuke or something.
