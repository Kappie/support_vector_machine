The next time I remember waking up was after 8:30 and all I remember about that was having a terrible headache, congestion and nausea. ... Wonderful.... Now after eating breakfast at 12:30 and drinking a phreaking ton of water, I feel much better, but I'm still not completely over the headache.   Odd.
