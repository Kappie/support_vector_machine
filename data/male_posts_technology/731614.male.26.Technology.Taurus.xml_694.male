If we could catch AmyJo on her way back from New Mexico, it would be half of the 10 housemates (though I don't think she spends much time on the internet outside the workplace, so I don't know how feasible that would be).  So when is a good time for everybody?  Evening?  Weekends??  LA or Orange County?? Sandra and I are pretty flexible.
