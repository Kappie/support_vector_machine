I write this blog post about Jini because I am sure, for the belivers, the wish list is not yet trashed.  Somewhere within mind we have a positive thought about the power of this  dream factory  framework.  Although many believes that Jini is just an R subject or that it is good to frame  aladin  stories and tell it to the kids of Java Technology world, someone like me have still the faith this technology can really make wonders.    But How?  This is certaily a tough question, but here are some of the thoughts that I feel could boost this technology and come up a new world of opportunities.     Start Learning it. Theres hardly anything in it for those who are comfortable with Java and RMI   Strat experimenting it. Write some  Hello World  kinda programs.   Discuss this with your friends and colleagues at coffee. Conceive new ideas   Startup/Join some project at  urlLink jini.org      For some historical background, check out the link to resource and find out what Jini is and how we can make use of it to transform the way we live.
