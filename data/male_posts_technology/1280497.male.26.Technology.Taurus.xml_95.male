I've long had a desire to be one of those enviable types of people that runs every day or at least consistently, but I haven't. I have run three marathons, but training for those marathons were the only times where I actually ran consistently, and then it was tough. Why aren't scientists looking for the consistency gene? That's pretty much all I need....
