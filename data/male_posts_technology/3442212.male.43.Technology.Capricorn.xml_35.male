So after the Eyeglass Incident, I've had a complete eye exam (they're fine, just nearsighted), and a kinda weird reversal of my vision.  I had to get a dilated eye exam, so they put the drops in, checked me out, and all was well. I wear contacts on occasion, usually for theatrical purposes, so I was led into the contact lens room to try the newest Acuvues. That, combined with the still-dilated eyes - the drops take a couple hours to wear off - left me farsighted.  I was in a shopping mall, and needed to eat, so I went to the sit-down place in the mall and tried to order. Couldn't  read!  This was alarming, even though it was temporary. Explained the situation to the waiter, then ordered a cheeseburger. I couldn't read the book I had, but I could see the Yankees game on TV just fine, so baseball it was.  Hopefully, I'll look distinguished when I eventually need bifocals.
