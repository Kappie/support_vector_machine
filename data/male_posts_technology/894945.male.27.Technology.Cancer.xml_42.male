I went to see "From Hell" the new Jack the Ripper movie... it's ok but for me the starring role was Heather Graham's left breast.  A man walks into a bar and stars chatting up a woman... "What's your name?" he asks. "Carmen" she says, "because I love cars and men. What's your name?"   "Charlie Beercunt"
