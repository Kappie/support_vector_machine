In Gates's ideal electronic home, PCs, TVs, videogame consoles, window shades, microwave ovens, refrigerators, and handheld computers will all be linked together and governed by Microsoft software."

 I don't mind Microsoft as such a dominating force in the software industry. As long as they make my digital world easier to live in, I don't mind what they do. There are plenty of bitter people and organizations out there keeping them honest. Why waste your valuable time on such activities, besides the fact there are so many other people doing it, and when there are so many more interesting things to do in the world. It's much more productive to take advantage of what a monopoly has to offer the consumer, than it is to spend time trying to fight it. If you ever talk to a Linux or Apple user, it amazes me how much of their time is spent complaining about Microsoft.
