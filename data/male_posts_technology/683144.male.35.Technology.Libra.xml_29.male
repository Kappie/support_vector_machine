It's not like it's going to spit out dollar bills through your CD ROM drive every time you log in. Why are people so excited about this?" It's the  search , mon, the seeeearrrch. It is that magic, mystical component that Yahoo and MSN have yet to be able to emulate as successfully. Fast, accurate search. The 1 GB is a gimmick, because yes it is true that setting up a POP box with multiple gigabytes of space is not that big of a deal.
