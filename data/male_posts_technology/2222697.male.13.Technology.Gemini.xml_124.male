We supposedly are learning to be engineers, and we played with a water thing today.The camp is the normal cliched camp, yes, a guy that is allergic to everything goes there too. I didn't think it was real interesting but it is for school and maybe we get to program...  Also for school the parents decided to make us start a group project, the other people decided that we should do an RPG. I really like the idea, I am team leader and I have to type out the story whenever I feel like it. It is gonna be about collecting keys to get this sword to bring peace to this world. How original.  I will actually make this RPG not like that thing I put in my first blog post about one. It will be published and it will be open-source. A website should be up soon.  -Elad
