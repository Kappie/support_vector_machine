Diehl  and included in this weblog and any related pages, including the weblog's archives, is licensed under a  Creative Commons License .      Now what the hell is that? That is another bright idea that started on the internet and thru it became versuccessfulll. What that is? It is a copyright that allows the use of the work or part of it.  Let me explain this on a simple way. Everytime you create something, that automatically has a copyright on it. You made it, you spent your time in the creation, it's yours. No-one can copy, use part of it, distribute or any other thing without your consent. That is the 'Â©' next to logos and on every book you'll find on a bookstore.  But since the popularization of the internet one thing came up quickly : cooperative work. We suddenly have lots of people from around the world working on the same program/book/music. And there was the single person that made something that he wanted to be distributed thru the internet. Be it a free software or a book. With that raised the GNU license that has it's pro's and cons and normally only applies to software.   urlLink Creative Commons  created a few "copyright licenses" for normal people. That means no lawyers, nor confusions when trying to use someone's work. Each license has two versions, the easy-to-read-and-easy-to-understand one and the legal wording one. Both say the same thing one is for the average people (you and me) and the other is for the lawyers of the world that like to speak weird stuff and read 3000 lines affirming something that can be said in one line and without fuss.  So Creative Commons made the (CC), something that states: "I made this, but you can use it if you do this and that." Simple, easy and fair to all. And better yet CC covers from text to music and other stuff.  Clearly everyone that has something online should check  urlLink Creative Commons  so they can assure their rights and still allow people to use their work. Like I do.  My type of CC License, says simply that you can use anything on this blog and by use I mean : copy, distributexhibitbit, execute, create something using this as a starting point, and even use commerciallylly. But you have to give me credit for what is my work and everything you do has to have the same License. It's that simple.  Use freely but add my name to the damn thing so I get the credit I deserve.  Cool?  I know I am.
