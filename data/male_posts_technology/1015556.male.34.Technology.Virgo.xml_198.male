D would say that in 2003, we saw all the fruit of our labor from the Dteam, since it was the year those guys graduated from high school.  I would agree, although, still, when I think of 2003, it was the year that he died.  We had a great year in terms of family, work, the starting of SPACE and other things, but I think I will always associated 2003 with The Padre.  It's good to know, to really know without a doubt, that he is in Heaven right now, worshipping with Jesus like nothing else.
