If you need a Blogger account to post messages here, you should email me: 0@zeroaltitude.org.  I get lots of spam so think of a good Subject line.  Post *all* desired Static runs here!  And if you have a conflict with a suggested run, post a Comment!  No Thursday runs, as Shari can't go.  Thank you!
