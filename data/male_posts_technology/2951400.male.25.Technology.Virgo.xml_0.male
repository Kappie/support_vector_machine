She had heard most of it before, I cared for her and she told me she had feelings for me but I wasn't sure what those were as she didn't explain much only hinting at the surface of something, leaving me to wonder how deep those feelings were if existent at all. This time I told her that before when she spoke of these feelings that I got hurt waiting for her to act on those feelings. Also I had written her a e-mail explaining if she was going to talk of these feelings she needed to make a decision and let me know if she wanted to be just friends or take things a step farther.   As the words left my lips I looked up and could barely see her face, it was a moonless night and I wish I could see if there was a change of expression as I felt like I was talking to myself. I shifted my leather jacket from one arm to the other, a sign of my uneasyness I felt very alone at that moment and very exposed. I finished hurried as I knew my words were not being heard as I would have liked, I could feel no effect they dropped to the ground lifeless, dead and worthless. The last word hung in the air and my heart sunk I felt small, very small and wanted to hide as much as I wanted to get my words and feelings out I knew that there was a chance that she would not be able to share them and would tell me so yet again. She looked at me for a moment I could feel her eyes looking at me maybe looking through me. As she spoke it was very few words and it was quick cutting deeply and I would spend the rest of the night hearing them over and over in my head. Even now they ring as a reminder of something that I wished for and was denied.  "I don't know what to say..." ; Was all she said.  With that she turned and went into her house and closed the door. With nothing to say maybe in her mind there was no reason to continue to look at me. For the longest time I felt rejection but with this girl and my past experiences I should be used to it by now. By my own accord I keep giving myself to someone that will not accept it, it would feel different if she were taking but not giving back and I had felt that in the past, used. Tonight that changed and I felt like my offering of myself to her was left on her doorstep and as I walked away that night, like dust, it was taken by the wind and giving to the heavens where all the other feelings and good intentions go that someone did not accept. They say that a "nice guy" will be walked over and used and will one day become jaded, I never want to be that guy, I know in my heart someone will take me for me and treat me as the treasure they have been looking for their whole life.
