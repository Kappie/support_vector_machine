I have started looking up PHP coding sites again for the SEM site and hastling Josh about the salsa congress site he wants me to work on.. Also have started hitting on friends (not like that) to see who knows people with small companys that need computer stuff done (I know there are some out there damnit! I KNOW IT!)  Also started looking at our internal security before I leave here, wanna make sure I leave a tidy network for my succesor :) I had forgotten how much I enjoyed all that stuff. (No I actually amn't being sarcastic)  Apart from that all is kinda boring.. Going to Cork for the weekend tho to see my Dad and the new mother to be (Not my mother, Dad's GF is preggers.. See  urlLink here  for my previous blog with all the GORIE details..) seeing as I haven't seen them since I heard the news.. Will probably try to hit my Dad up for some potential customers too..  K, I have to go clean my desk and remove all the porn from my hard disk just in case anyone goes snooping while I am out next week.. You never know what will happen when I only have two weeks left :)  Go away.
