The terrorists are now fighting a war on two fronts - something history has shown is unwinnable.   JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia -- The kidnapping and beheading of American Paul Johnson Jr. may mark a turning point in Saudi public opinion against his al-Qaida slayers.  Celebrations broke out at the news Friday that Abdulaziz al-Moqrin, the man responsible for Johnson's death, had been killed. It was the first time in the Saudis' 13-month fight against terrorism that ordinary citizens expressed joy at security forces' success.  "Whatever their disagreements with the United States, however much they are against U.S. support for Israel or the war in Iraq, Saudis feel that Americans and foreigners in general should be able to feel safe in the kingdom," says Turki al-Dakheel, who hosts a show on the Al Arabiya network.  The need to win over public opinion has become more apparent as the Saudi government intensifies its battle against terrorists. If popular sentiment turns away from jihadists, analysts say, it could undermine their ability to find support in the form of hiding places and suicide cars.
