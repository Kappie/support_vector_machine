J: Yeah, I know. When are you picking up my pictures from the newsagency?  C: Uh, tomorrow. But I mean portraits!  J: Of?  C: Us!  J: *blank look*  C: I mean, lovely portraits of the four of us looking quaint.  J: Oh! Like standing on a river bank out in the country wearing period clothing?  C: And looking wistful!  J: Yeah! And maybe playing croquet. Or just posing with a croquet mallet held jauntilly over one shoulder.  C: Ooohh, or riding.  J: Yes! Our four person polo team!
