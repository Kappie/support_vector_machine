In todays complex world of Software One must put themselves in the shoes of the users and think, Why this has to be like this and why not like that?      Therefore, one must make sure that UI is the prime concern of any S/W Development Process.      One cannot assume the User knows !!!, but dont develop software thats too easy to handle as well ;).      We have to follow the guidelines given to us by our Team Architects and Leaders etc .       And we must meet with the customer from time to time and discuss other issues involving the UI Design Phase.      Next we all can sit comfortable coding and going thru the QA Cycle etc.      What do you think?      Send me a mail to      urlLink  anil_mahadev007@hotmail.com       on the above matter.
