I did not want her to go but I could not stop it.  I cannot even describe my hatred for   SFW   I know god tells me I should not hate but I have to admit watching my daughter drive off with her little hand waving to me filled me with more hatred for   SFW   then one can possibly imagine except for the 60% of you that are in the divorced category and probably the 50% of that who do not have custody of their children.  I took Karissa to breakfast this morning and bought her a big breakfast and let her pick out her snacks for the trip back to MI.  I have had such a great time with her here the pool, the circus, even just hangin with friends!  It sucked to have   SFW   come to town and ruin that for me!  So as I sit her I contemplate driving...not necessarily to any place in particular but driving just to get out of the house and have something to do.  I miss Karissa dearly and feel this is so wrong how can I have walked into a courtroom and essentially won only to have Karissa leave?  I feel the ruling was fair however, I wish he would have said the child will remain in the fathers custody until such time as   SFW   got back into compliance of the court order.    Of course it would only be another 10 days of which I have to work 4 of them so I guess that is not all that great of a situation.  At this point I am merely rambling letting my fingers do the talking :)   All I can say is Goodbye Karissa and I will wait with great anticipation until you come to visit daddy again!
