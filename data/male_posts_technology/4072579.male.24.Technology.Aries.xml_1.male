This is the second tattoo that I've used it on and its probably the best healer out there. It is pricey, but worth the price. Not only does it heal quickly, it also has a very pleasant aroma, I've been told its the rosemary and the lavender extracts that it has in it.        On a side note, I have actually been offered a decent sum of money to eat an entire can of tattoo goo. This was brought on by me talking about how good it smelled and I blurted out something like, I would probably eat it if I didnt need it. I think I might do it, all the ingredients are non-toxic so I dont think it would kill me.
