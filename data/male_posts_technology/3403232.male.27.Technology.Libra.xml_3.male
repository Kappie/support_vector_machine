Its kind of fun to have them out there, even though its unlike that anyone will see this because I won't tell anyone about it.  Most people who know me get to hear me bitching enough without having to subject to them it in written form.  The important thing to know about me is that I am bored a lot.  I mean 8 hours a day.  Which oddly enough coincides with the 8 hours a day I spend at work.  This blog could now afford me a venue for some fun stream of conciousness stuff.  Which will be interesting coming from me at work.  Probably filled with lots of things about what an idiot my boss is.  Or what a shitty town Burlington, NC is.  I expect a lot of bitching will be done about the women in my life as well.  You see besides being devilishly good looking I am also afflicted with the nice guy syndrome.  So far it has brought me nothing but headaches.  I expect more to be coming in the near future as well.  Pages more to come on that at some later date.  Now I have to take a shower because its really hot.
