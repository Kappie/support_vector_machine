The computer bug also included an infecting file called 'teekids.exe' that experts quickly associated with Parson's Web site: Hackers routinely substitute '3' for the letter 'e' in their online aliases." 
Congrats to the Paper of Record for being hip to l33t-speak.  The editor of Virus Bulletin further ribs Parson for being so conspicuous, "I guess we should praise the Lord for stupid people, right?"  
  
Or blame them for leaving easily-exploited security holes in their software.
