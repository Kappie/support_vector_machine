Now I am listening to all these clips I have downloaded from the inertnet. How amusing. Tonight Taken is on so I WILL be watching that. Not that anyone else will, apart from Andy probably. I'm off to town tomorrow with Jo C and Angela to spend my vouchers. Will it be fun? We'll have to wait and see. So, other than that. Chal for now.
