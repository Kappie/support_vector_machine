While I understand that the stresses of warfare can create this kind of reaction, turning  any  normal human being into virtual sociopaths (even temporarily), in this particular situation allowing it to prevail is not an option. The US is having a hard enough time convincing the world - hell even it's own citizens - that it did the right thing invading Iraq. It doesn't need gung-ho trigger happy farmboys perpetuating the stereotype that  all  US citizens are violent 'sand-nigger-killin' racists. Sadly, world opinion is shallow and moronic enough to buy such a stereotype based purely upon face value.  Laurence over at  urlLink Commentary  has some more on this regarding the incident's exposure in the SA media.
