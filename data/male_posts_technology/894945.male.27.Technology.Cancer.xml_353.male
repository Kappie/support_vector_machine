This wierd white stuff is falling from the sky! and Baity is not spaffing off Sand street carpark! I dunno, It just aint right you know, It should only snow in January when we have all just gone back to school for a couple of weeks. The Radio and Tv would be telling us that there is 0.000000000001 mm of snow fall and therefore its two dangerous for those people in the sticks (St. Marys/St Ouens..) to travel and therefore Schools are closed!  But no.  Work still goes on.  but here is a simulation of  urlLink THE STUPID PEOPLE ON THE ROADS . but this time you get to drive!!! (see no mention of women driving...)
