Here is part of the conversation:  Sis    : Eh nick celebrating the  1 month naming ceremony of his son.this sat, wana go..around 5pm, u free?  Me : cant i going out. told u mah. u tell me so last minute.   Sis    : nick only called me today la.....where you going  Me : play pool. movie. and maybe get wasted.   Sis : cannot postpone.... ? Me : hmm wait ah let me think. choosing between going out with a hot nubile chick or watching a baby being given a name ...........hmm.   Me: ok it was a tough decision but i think I have to decline. But tell the baby I said hi.   Oh in case you are wondering why the English in the conversation has so many strange words like ah and mah it's Singlish.
