Let me here from you! georgeb@whitehouse.gov   If you want to IM me, its prez42168@aol.com. (closest thing to Prezident avail :(   I get so bored!!!   Ok. So what’s been happenin’? Did you here that Reagan died? He was a friend of my dad’s, so it’s weird that he died. When my mom called and told me I was sooo bummed. I actually went in my room and cried. GULP!   I guess that means he is never going to be president again :(   Here’s some cool links. (Some of these are my faves.)   www.ebay.com   www.amazon.com   www.tvland.com   www.NRA.com   www.AmIhotOrNot.com   femalesquirters.com   Went shopping at the mall today. Got three new pairs of slacks. Yaaayy! Took me forever to find some that fit me just right. A 25 inch inseem sux!!!!   Picked up two hats that I like. One says “Kill Orientals: They die quicker.” Isn’t Abercrombie and Fitch the best??!!??   Hey, what do you think of the whole Iraq thing? georgeb@whitehouse.gov   You know what my wife said to me last night? Her name is Laura and she’s real cool. She let’s me go out with my friends whenever I want to. Except on datenight. :( Anyway, she told me that I have a cute butt! J Kick-A!   Think Condeleeza Rice has a dick?   I do.   Whazzzz upppp? (Remember those commercials?) I am so bored. I have to meet with the French President in like two hours, I didn’t even think they had Presidents. It’s not like their Americans! Are they? What is U.N.?   OH, the new Avril Lavigne just came on the radio! Why you gotta be so complicated!   Anywho… This is too cool having my own blog!   Can U believe I get to live in the F**KING White House?!?! First student council, now THIS!   Guess who IM’ed me last nite? JOHN MAYER!   He’s only like the coolest singer around! Wonder if he would teach me guitar? As IF!   Ho hum…   Let’s see… what else is going on?   I met the Pope. We were led into some old church in Grease somewhere, and there was the pope sitting on a chair, being old.   OMG. He looked a hundred! They say he is only 83, but I think they fudging it so the Mexicans won’t think he is going to die soon. You know how they are. ;)   They say he is like the president of all the catholics. If he is, maybe he should warn them that they are all going to hell! That’s what my Sunday School teacher said anyway. Oh well…   Guess I should get going… VPOS   See ya!   IM me. I’m serious.   The PREZ    Don’t forget to vote for me in October!
