Two of the people I'm working for are running small businesses.  So ignoring IE, and just putting a warning for IE users on the front page isn't an option.   OH , how I'd like to.  Recently I was added to the  urlLink Fink Project  as a committer.  I've been sending packages in for a little over a year.  I wanted to eventually be a committer, but I wasn't going to make myself annoying by asking for it, and I didn't expect that it'd be offered so soon.  I saw  urlLink Chronicles of Riddick  this weekend.  It was an ok-movie, but not all that impressive.  The plot felt rather thin and rushed.  It felt like there could have been an interesting background that this story was painted on, but we didn't get to see much of it.  Expect it to be a shallow action flick, and you'll enjoy it.  I discovered the most  adorable  little desktop:  urlLink xfce .  I've been a loyal  urlLink fvwm  user for the past three years or so.  I've tried a few other desktops and WMs, and not found any that I like quite as much as fvwm.  I found  urlLink KDE  to be -very- bloated and slow. I found  urlLink GNOME  to be better, but still rather slow on my 800MHz PIII.  After trying those two, I generally stayed away from Desktops.  But after reading a good review of xfce, I figured Why not? and tried it.  I think I'm actually going to keep it.  Old dogs can learn new tricks.
