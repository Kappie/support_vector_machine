Mind you it was a trial, the DJ went to line 5, not me; I thought they'll get the answer right, but no they couldn't hear them so they came to me. My big chance but they couldn't hear me either! Bugger I thought my chance up in smoke. The DJ soon realised they had a problem and played a record while they sorted out the technical difficulties!  Anyway problem solved, they went back to the man on line 5, he had to work out from a girl speaking a load of Italian what job she did. All I could make out was the word sex or sexy, which I'm guessing is the same the world over!  The choices were a-Gymnast, b-Fashion Model or c-Barmaid  The chap on line 5 went for fashion model - if I'd have been first I might have said the same thing. He was wrong so they came to me next and I went with my gut feeling of Barmaid and the rest as they say is history.  What did I win, well its a weekends driving experience for 2 with Â£150 spends; driving new  old Mini's, learning how to handle them around a race track and includes driving E-type jags and a big red 52 seater buses! I'm also in the draw on Friday for a VIP trip to LA. Wish me luck!    Isn't comping just great.
