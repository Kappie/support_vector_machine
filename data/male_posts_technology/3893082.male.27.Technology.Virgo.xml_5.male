Friday I sat on my arse and played on my computer without eating anything until supper, dumb ass! Saturday, work really sucked as it was boring as hell. Nothing new there.     I did however decide to go out "clubbing" last night though. Went to the Buzz in scottsdale and drank too much and stayed out too late. Now I am at work on three hours sleep and still a little tipsy from the alcohol. Woohoo! :-) Kinda of getting bored of the club scene though. Lots of nice scenery but most of it is a little to high maintenance or too young to be worth maintaining. Atleast in my opinion that is.     I also read something today that kind of got me in to a depressed, sit-in-a-corner, leave-me-alone, type mood that I usually get in to when I start thinking about life in general. It's the Hacker's Manifesto by The Mentor. Any fan of the movie Hackers can tell you that it is a thought provoking and controversial document, but the part read in the movie is not the entire thing.     The document provides an inside look at the toughts of a teenager that most people would think is too smart for his own good. You know who I am talking about, the stereotypical hacker kid. Sits alone in front of a computer for hours on end, preferring to stare at typed text instead of communicating verbally. Tends to be an introvert and doesn't socialize at all with friends, and rarely with family, if they are not online in some sort of fashion.     What interests me though is not the document itself or WHO it represents, but the point that it makes. Everyone tends to judge people automatically by the rules that society as a whole has enforced upon us. How do they look? How much do they own? Are they wealthy or poor? What color is their skin? Are they male or female? and so on and so on.     Society as a whole needs to wake up and realize that, with computers starting to play a more significant role in the day to day life for everyone, people are going to become numbers and names. Your appearance and social status will no longer be as important as who you are and what information you share.     People will become faceless and names will become meaningless. The person you are dealing with may represent themselves as a 6'2" Blonde Haired, Blue-Eyed beauty but in reality they could be a 4'5" Bald, Blind, 600 pound individual that has to type with a stick because their fingers are to large for the keyboard! Sure, providing pictures and a means to verify who you are speaking with is a possible way to eliminate this, but in the digital world, reality is not what it seems. Pictures can be faked and identities can be spoofed. All it takes is time.    Unlike the real world, the digital world can be shaped and formed in to whatever the person with the knowledge and time to do so wants it to become. Where I exist in this digital world can be as close to someone else as the width of a hair or as far away as the breadth of the universe.    My brains hurting and I've lost interest in this post so I will stop boring you all with my philosophical babble.    Blog at ya'll later...
