I bet it rains for the whole journey down there though, which won't be very interesting seeings as we have to drive cos my dad is too stingy to pay out for air fares. But hey ho, that's life I guess. Um. Other than that, I haven't been doing much at all! Yesterday I went to CAterham to the dentist, and that was a bundle of laughs as usual. Then bought a book on M15 since the Cold War and the changing faces of espionage whcihc will take my mind off things when GCSE results are out. Um, fun. Yeah, life seems to be all doom and gloom atm, i'm sure it's not really, just through a teenager's eyes it is. Well I can't really thnk of anythign else to say cos my jammy dodgers are yelling ast me from inside my tummy (i think I ate too many in too short a space of time), and, um, just to say hi Jackie an dMax have a nice summer, Nicki hope u had fun on your trip thingy, and Tom don't forget to go to work! Bye!
