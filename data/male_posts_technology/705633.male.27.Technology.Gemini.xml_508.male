I went shopping in the afternoon with the girls and I did turn up a bit late so I thought it might be that.    The bar was really crowded and loud so I suggested we go somewhere quieter to talk.    He was still very subdued and distracted so I suggested we go somewhere nice to eat.    All through dinner he just didn't seem himself; he hardly laughed, and didn't seem to be paying any attention to me or to what I was saying. I just knew that something was wrong.    He dropped me back home and I wondered if he was going to come in; he hesitated, but followed.     I asked him again if there was something the matter but he just half shook his head and turned the television on.    After about 10 minutes of silence, I said I was going upstairs to bed. I put my arms around him and told him that I loved him deeply.    He just gave a sigh, and a sad sort of smile.    He didn't follow me up, but later he did, and I was surprised when we made  love.    He still seemed distant and a bit cold, and started to think that he was going to leave me, and that he had found someone else.    I cried myself to sleep.
