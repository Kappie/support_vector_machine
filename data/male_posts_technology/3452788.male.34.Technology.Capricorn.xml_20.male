       
      I have so much to say sometimes, I wonder how I can contain it.  I wish I could sit and write for 2 or 3 days straight, and just get it all out in writing so I can see the beast and kill it.  I have so much pent-up frustration and dissapointment and anger with myself and almost everyone around me.  Sometimes I get a panic attack and I have to go to the beach and start yelling.  I am so fucked up.  The therapist tells me I am still an abused child, that I continue to abuse myself every day.  Bite me, maybe I like it that way.
