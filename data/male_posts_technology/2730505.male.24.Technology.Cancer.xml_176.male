At work we're trying to get all the Macs onto the same network that the rest of the company is on so that they can access and use the same resources that were once only made available to Windows machines (network drives, netowrk printers, shared folders, back-up of their data etc).  Last week has been hectic around here as well as the start of this week.  I've also beel playing a lot more RS3.  Last night I played till about 12:30 AM.  Not bad really considering the night before I played till 3.  I had no idea it was 3 till dies 10 straight times without a kill.  I was playing against a bunch of XTC people on their server.  Monday really screwed my stats up.    Tuesday was a diferent story.  After going home to help clean the party for my parents, I ate dinner there and took the rest of the alchohol to my apartment.  I have almost a case of Corona and almost a case of Sam Adams in the fridge in my apartment.  I also have a half of the half gallon of Cuervo margarita mix with the Cuervo in it already sitting in the fridge.  Me thinks that some of that will be drank today.  I've also been playing a lot with  urlLink Porkchop55 .  She's a girl and she's not too bad.  She's got a great voice and a good sense of humor.  I don't really know what she looks like but it's fun to talk to her online.  She's half Filipino and half white, short and thin.  Usually, these mestisas are pretty hot.  Of course I don't trust everything people say online but it's a nice picture she painted thought.  She has a kid and wew talked about our respective kids.  That was pretty cool.  She has a 2 year old and so do I.  Eh, whatever, I'm just having one of my crushes like usual.  Seems like I have a new crush every damn week or every few days.  Well Again I have reached the greater than 1 kill ratio.  I finally had a round where I killed everyone on the other team all by myself.  YEAH!  12v12 and I got 6 kills.  I don't know if anyone here plays RS3 but we were playing the Map City Streets Large and I rushed the big box room killed two people there.  Camped for about 15 seconds waiting for more people to go through the box room.  One came in and I sniped him with my M16 right on the head.  After that I went back towards red team's base and came up around the bunker area and shot the sniper that was hanging out by the windows.  That was 4.  Went back downstairs and as soon as I turned the corner there was a member of the green team that was walking towards read team's underground access way and I just stalked him for a while and shot him in the head as well.  After killing the 5th guy, everyone on my team died so I decided to make a rush for their spawn.  CLimbed the ladder and no one was there so I went up to the upstairs spawn of green team and found a guy sniping in the window.  I shot him in the back of his head.  Six kills no deaths baby.  My weekly stats are  urlLink here .  Not bad eh?  I plan on improving upon that tonight when I get on and on Thursday when there's a supposed "live journal Rainbow Six 3 online gathering"  That should be fun.  In sports news, Cubbies have won two straight against Houston.  FUCK YEAH!  Handed Clemens his first loss of the season and then the Cubs had an amazing 9th to finish of Houston!  fuck yeah, Cubbies for Life baby.  The same time that was showing the defensive minded Distroit Pistons beat LA.  FUCK YEAH!  It would have been a sweep if it weren't for a breakdown in the final minutes of regulation in Game 2.  Oh well, they won it all.  Good for them.  Defense and good shooting propelled Detroit to their first championship since the Bad boys era.  I hope Detroit doesn't burn down.  Well that was about it.  Oh and Sam the answer to the logic problem was the German.
