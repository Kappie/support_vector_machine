XXOOXXOOXXOOXXOOXXOO  Dear Gede, wishing you the very best of birthdays. We are all missing you heaps - well maybe me a little more than the others. Have a fun day - drag some people out to the pub and have a pint or two - maybe not three or four ;)  Back here Kaia has become the raging party animal that she was always meant to be - this evening for example was spent in front of the fire - knitting one very funky scarf.  Ok seriously sad but Secret life was on - very scarey episode - Kelly ended up almost being raped and was hit by scarey weird guy - and that's not the end of it - it continues next week!  Not exactly up uplifting episode that I was looking for.  But - look at me - have a wonderful birthday - have a bit of a party and maybe we can have a belated celebration in a couple of weeks.  Much love Kai  PS will knit matching funky scarf for you :)
