It was complicated, in that she is a celebrity), and about how I had managed to come to terms with not just the breakup, which I had done a long time ago, but also with what she was to me now in the aftermath.   Usually, its easy to do when you say stuff like "lets just be friends" but you mean it in that special way that says "lets be the kind of friends that never see or talk to each other again". But what do you do when she is well-known, has a talent you appreciate, and you really can't get away from her even if you never see her again? Its a bit harder, believe me.  But why was it hard? I mean, it was not about the breakup. Or anything to do with the relationship itself. Or missing her. Or wanting to be with her. Or really anything like that. I came to a realization what it  was  about, though. It was about discovering how to still appreciate her, and her talent. Finding a way to see her as amazing in a more conventional way. And that is what I managed to do. I even managed to still be friends with her, which is also pretty cool. :-)   With that said, it made me think about how often after a breakup you tend to lose touch with people. In one of the more dramatic examples that happened in my life, a woman who I was going to marry (despite my being one of the most cynical and pessimistic bastards on the face of the third rock from the sun) is someone who I do not talk to or know where she lives except thats its somewhere in West Seattle. I know her cellphone number but only for the same reason that I know my 6th grade locker combination -- because I never forget a fucking thing. We did not part on terrible terms, but she went from literal best friend to love-of-my-life-soulmate to acquaintance to whereabouts-unknown-stranger. What I know about the life choices she has made since the breakup does not inspire me to think that she is still the same person who was my best friend. And I have to admit that this turn of events kinda blows goats. Yet I do not feel any motivation to call her and try and change that, to try to bring back that friendship. There is a difference between missing a thing and wanting to do something to get it back, after all. The difference is whether you decide you just wanted to be friends. Because in the end you won't be....  So suddenly I am a lot happier with how things turned out with this sorta-ex. Because of all the people with whom things did not work out, she is really the first with whom I have managed to still have some kind of connection to. I'd love to say its a sign I am growing, but its probably because circumstances forced it on me. The real test will be next relationship that ends. And that would be fairly insane to plan for (such people never find another girlfriend!), so for now I will pretend I have grown and just ponder the depths that the experience has given me. :-)
