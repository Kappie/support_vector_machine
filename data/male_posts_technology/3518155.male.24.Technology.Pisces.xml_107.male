I'm done with  urlLink Sonny Boy Williamson's: His Best  and  urlLink Paul Butterfield Blues Band . Now I'm stuck listening to Little Walters'  urlLink His Best  collection, which I seem to be enjoying the most.  I'm hoping to steal a bunch of harmonica solos from Walters' songs, and I'm starting to find that I like his no-frills, yet extremely soulful singing just as much as his brilliant harp-playing. So he's the guy to emulate now. I'm working on  Can't Hold Out Much Longer ,  Mean Old World  and  Last Night . And  Blues With a Feeling , of course. Walters' version of this song pounds the hell out of the Paul Butterfield version. Which is saying a lot, because the Butterfield version is pretty damn good!  So much to learn. So little time.
