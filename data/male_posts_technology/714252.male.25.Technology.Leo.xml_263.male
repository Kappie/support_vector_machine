"Yeah a few bits, I'm going to collect them now" "Not any more you don't!" "What?" "The Flat burnt down last night, it isn't there anymore" "You're shitting me"  Yes I actually said "You're shitting me".. A few phone calls later and I am still none the wiser so I head in for a look.. I have to say Jonny.. You really know how to throw a party ;)  I have to say the damage wasn't as bad as it could have been but the flat is pretty fucked up allright. I actually managed to salvage quite a few bits and pieces. There is nothing like a flat burning down to help you clear out the rubbish you collect in life..  Anyway.. The rest of the weekend was pretty good.. I actually went to Salsa on Sunday (I have so little motivation for salsa at the moment.. Myself and Orla have decided to make a point of going every Tues and Thurs but I actually don't find myself thinking I can't wait to get to salsa..) I don't know if my lack of motivation is a personal or a boredom thing.. Must track that little bugger of a thought down some day soon..  As I mentioned recently I think I may have found a light at the end of the work related tunnel, as soon as I figure out exactly what the plan is I shall reveal some of it :)  K, That's me for now.. C ya..
