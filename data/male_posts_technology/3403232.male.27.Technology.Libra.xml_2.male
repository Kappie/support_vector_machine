Not to mention it will clear up many questions about all the things I am bitching about.  Here we go:   My Job   For about the last 3 years I have been working at LabCorp in Burlington, NC as a software developer.  I actually like being a software developer most of the time.  The problem is that I hate LabCorp.  Its not even LabCorp that's the problem so much as its my boss, and his boss, and his boss.  My boss is a complete idiot.  He has no idea what it is he is doing, or what I'm supposed to be doing.  Consequently it seems my main job is keeping my chair from floating away.  Since my boss doesn't know what I do he can't make any decisions about what I should be doing with my time.  And he doesn't believe me when I tell him what I should do so I continue to hold down my chair.  The worst part of all this is the meetings.  The endless, pointless meetings.  We have meetings all the time to discuss things we discussed in other meetings last week.  And the week before.  And the week before that.  And the week before that.  Apparently since he can't decide what we should do he just figures if we talk about it enough things will solve themselves.  Unfortunately for me I live in an area with a large population of hyper-educated people.  Many of whom are unemployed.  This makes it very difficult for me to get a new job because all the companies that are hiring have a bunch of candidates with masters degrees (and no actually useful knowledge).  And then there's me, I have no degree in anything so everyone just assumes I'm stupid.  I have a whole other rant about that little socially accepted bigotry.  But I'll save it for later.  So I keep looking for a job and saving my money in case I need to quit this one to save my sanity.  I'm pretty sure the day is coming that I will have to do that.  I'm not normally a violent person but some days I just want to beat the shit out of my boss when he says something stupid.  Which just so happens to be every time his mouth is moving.   It looks like this background is going to take quite a few posts to get it all in.  The really long part is going to be about my love life which is horribly complicated thanks to all the insane girls I end up dating.  I guess I will tackle that one next.
