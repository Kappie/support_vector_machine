The last week seem to go very,very,very quickly but I had a blast of a time. From day one, going to the Caulfield Cup, attending Judy Crepe's birthday bash and going out on romantic dinners with Kai... All done in one week. Of course it was no where near enough time but I'm very much looking forward to the next time I'm back in December - party, christmas and Bali - here we come!  Halloween is coming up this weekend and in preparation, I've bought myself a pumpkin to carve. Never done one and I just hope that I don't slice into my hand in the process - blood splashed over it might make it look more scary but I don't really want it to be mine. It's one pretty decent sized pumpkin so I'm wondering what I can do with the pulp - if it's at all edible. I suppose I could make a hell of a lot of pumpkin soup. I'll put some photos up on the  urlLink photo album  when I figure out how to carve it!  The flight back here was long to say the least. I sat next to a man who's going to London just to see some favourite artists and cover bands from the 70s! He's even going to a band who remake the whole shows, including lighting and special effects, of Genesis concerts! Can't for the life of me can't remember his name but he's also good friends with a man who is an expert on comedies. Even wrote a guide to BBC radio comedies.   Finished the last few chapters of Michael Moore's "Dude, Where's My Country!" and the final verdict: man, I'm glad I don't live in the US and I sure help they work themselves out for the safety of the planet. Moore's pretty emotional through, well, all of the book but to get across what's happening I think you've gotta.
