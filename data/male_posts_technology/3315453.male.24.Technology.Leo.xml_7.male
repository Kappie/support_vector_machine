In my previous math classes it did not seem like you hade to really think about the problem, you just knew it or you didn't.  Now it takes a lot of brainpower.  For example, it takes my teacher about 1 hour to explain two problems.  Yet it takes me 2 hours two do one.  So far I have received a 90% and a 83% on tests in that class, so I guess I must understand something.  Chinese is going well.  I have a much harder teacher this quarter, but that is good.  It seems like I am learning a lot more now. Becca is doing very well in her Chinese class.  She gets A's on all of her assignments and tests.  I get really jealous sometimes at how good she is at it, but she does work very hard and earns what she gets.  I get a five-day weekend this week because UPS is on the slower part of the season and they asked if I wanted a couple days of this week.  I accepted with much joy because I need to catch up with my homework.  Not much is planed for us this weekend just schoolwork for now.  I did find out some bad news about school this summer.  The school I go to for some reason does not offer financial aid over the summer so I do not think I will be able to go.  It may be good because I might be able to get a second job for the summer and catch up on some bills.  Or I might just take one class.  I am just not sure.  Well I hope you all enjoyed this and look for a new post tomorrow.   "You must be the change you wish to see in the world." ---- Mahatma Gandhi
