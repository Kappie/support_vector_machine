Karen and I are so looking forward to going back we can't stand it.  Joe, Tam, the girls and Debbie will all be arriving Sunday afternoon.  I don't know if there is a way to thank our friends Stevie and Sherri for taking us there in the first place and exposing us to it.  I now look foward to it all year long.  It is my much needed decompress - especially this year.  I have been wound pretty tight (just like everyone else).
