I panicked a bit last Friday, added to that I was a bit down and the fact that I've not sent a Valentines for 3 years caused a bit of a change reaction. Lucky I could depend on the cynical marketing people at Interflora to enable the impluse purchase funtions on their website. Within 5 minutes I'd booked flowers. They'll arrive in our office on the Friday, she will not be around for the 14th. They are anon of course.  Ah well, can't cancel them now.
