That's what my friends tell me and thank me for. But why cant i at least for once encourage and motivate myself toward something, anything! How do you call a person who is concerned only with his own self? Selfish? Self centered? What's the opposite of that? What does psychology have to say about that? Is it a common classic phenomenon? Is it a phenomenon?
