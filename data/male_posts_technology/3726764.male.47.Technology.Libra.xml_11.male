The way I see it, the greatest feeling in the world is the first time someone you really, really like discovers how you feel for them, the same time you discover that they really, really like you. And the neatest thing is, most people get to experience this feeling several times. The sad thing is, once you get married, you never(almost, usually) get to experience that feeling again. Another good excuse for me still being single.
