Met some of the people that played Rainbow Six 3.  Biggergunz, Blade1000, BMW JAY, TheProduct23.  I already knew FourRunner and WarMoose77 (I work with them) so that was cool.  So after drinking and eating for a few hours and talking RS3 I headed home to open up a server.  Apparently I have a pretty good connection so I am the designated host for the games.  I guess my cable modem connection has a pretty good upload speed so I can host up to 16 people.  I benchmarked and performed a stress test on my connection by having 16 people and playing the Trainyard map.  Trainyard, being the largest of the maps available, always gave a lot of servers some problems.  It ran fine except when someone joined and had a shitty connection (like one star or something).  When people had crappy connections and wasn't on my friends list, I would boot them.  Oh well, they know it isn't personal.  Now when people are being jackasses, I won't be holding back to boot them even if they are friends of the friends on my friends list.  So back the Friday, after I had met everyone, I went back home and started a server.  Everyone was on.  I invited some other people who were on my friends list and were online and BAM!  We had a game in 3 minutes.  It was 8 on 8 and it was a lot of fun because our Clan (DDS or Doing it Doggy Style) went on a tear early on.  We rattled of 5 straight games and it was just a lot of fun.  I was able to bring my ELO up to 1100 which was the highest it has ever been.  I was averaging 2-3 kills and dying every other round (yeah some people would get lucky).  Over all it was a good night.  Too good considering I played till 5:30 in the AM and I was playing against people from the fucking UK.  It was pretty cool.  Saturday I woke up late and helped my parents with the house.  Saturday night I went to Alumni Club and had a few drinks and danced a little.  I made fun of people again.  It was hilarious.  Yes I know I am a jackass but whatever.  hot tip here.  If you don't want me making fun of you, go out there and have a good time.  don't be pretentious about your dancing.  I only pick on people who dance and think that they are good but in fact, they suck.  after the bar I got back home and played more XBOX Live.  I know I am a nerd.  It's awesome!    By the way, for the people that are close, there's a party for my parent's 25th wedding anniversary this Saturday, June 12th.  If you can make it email me.  It's from like 4 till 12 or something.  I guess that's it for now.
