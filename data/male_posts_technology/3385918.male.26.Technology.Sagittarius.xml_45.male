Lo's Secret Wedding Revealed   Jennifer Lopez married Marc Anthony in secret on Saturday, after telling guests they were invited to a "beautiful" party at her Los Angeles home. Astonishing pictures British newspapers today show the couple, both dressed in white, holding hands at makeshift alter under a flower-covered canopy after walking down a petal-strewn aisle in the garden of Lopez' luxury Beverly Hills mansion. Vivaldi's Four Seasons was played by a string quartet as Lopez, 33, was escorted down the aisle by her dad David, wearing an ivory lace dress and Neil Lane jewelry worth $200,000. Latin crooner Ricky Martin later serenaded the couple and their 35 guests - who were told they were only invited to a "beautiful afternoon party". A friend says, "We had no idea that this was planned until we got a call to be at her home on Saturday. There are rumors she may be pregnant. She is certainly glowing and looked ecstatically happy." The union comes just five months after Lopez split from former fiance Ben Affleck - whom she planned to marry in a canceled ceremony last September - and just days after singer Anthony, 35, finalized his divorced from his ex- wife, and the mother of his three children, Dayanara Torres.   ***************************************  Sailor Ecchi says:  Jennifer Lopez once again proves that she can't do shit without a dick in her mouth. It's so tasteless the way this freaking woman can't survive one months without a man. Why do you insist in marrying people, "Lo"? Think you found true love? With Marc Anthony? Let's see how quickly he tires of fucking you and moves onto the next piece of meat.  Oh, and Mr. Anthony... Good luck marketing your new CD to the Latino community. I bet they'll really love you now that you divorced Dayanara Torres (an ex - Miss Universe winner who is taking care of your two kids) to quickly marry a slut (she should be called J.Ho not J.Lo).
