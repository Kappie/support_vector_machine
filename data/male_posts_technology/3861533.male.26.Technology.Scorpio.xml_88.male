Yeong-ju, a government official, is selected by her boss the be the one in their office to learn English. In her class she meets Moon-su, a shoe salesman, whom she falls in love with. But he is more interested in the hot Australian teacher...  The first half of the movie is mainly comedic. I didn't really care for the slapstick bits, but once the movie kicked into a more dramatic mode, things at least got better. Generally speaking I could have done with most of the comedy being replaced by drama instead.   -->
