I don't want to get into a Palm vs PocketPC argument, but I still think Sony makes the sexiest device even though  in my opinion  PocketPC is an operating system which has more going for it.  Regardless of which device you choose, the first task after purchase is replacing the standard apps with ones which suit your personality better. I use a new launcher, agenda/calendar/contacts app and a swag of science tools and games.  Link:  www.cliesource.com  or  www.pocketpcthoughts.com
