I would have purchased an  urlLink IBM Thinkpad R , but whenever I would try to pick the parts I wanted, the price would always be "NA".  Maybe that means they are sold out of Thinkpad Rs, but they could have told me in a better fashion.  Because of this set back, I might just buy a laptop from Compaq.  If someone had told me last week that I was going to get a Compaq, I would have laughed my ass off.  Instead, I have fallen in love with the  urlLink Compaq Presario 900 .  As of right now, it is looking like I will be getting these specs:  Mobile Athlon XP 2000+  256 MB 266MHz DDR  30 gig hard drive  8x DVD drive 14.1" XGA Display  Built-in 56k modem and 10/100 NIC  The laptop is a bit beefier than my last one (1.5" thick and 6.8 lbs), but it shouldn't be a noticeable difference.
