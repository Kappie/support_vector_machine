Performed as part of a sales proposal, a site assessment can help you speak knowledgeably about solutions to your potential client's problems. As part of a “discovery” phase of a project, it can help uncover opportunities for improvement. Additionally, it can serve as a benchmark to be tested against later in the design process."
