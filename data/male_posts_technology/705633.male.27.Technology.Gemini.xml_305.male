This Friday night it's all going to be blasting off, ten lads (some of the TF crew and most of my buddies from work) are heading over to a 60's party in Guernsey for the night. We are on a misson to find good looking Guernsey girls, i've been told they are as rare as hen's teeth so the challenge has been set and photos will be posted!!  Then this Saturday we'll be back over here in full TF battle mode so lock up your daughters or Grist will fertilize them. I'll post time/place for Saturday night on here when I get my shit together. All TF readers are welcome to show up and ply us with Jose Cuervo in celebration of my 23rd year and the official start of the Christmas party season.   urlLink Here's the pictures from last saturday at the Splash.  Thanks Andy.  Competition time!! We want to see 'I love the Toaster Files' written on girl's breasts or booty, preferable while wearing a g-string. We will buy the winning lady a bottle of bubbly at Follies. Send your entries to  urlLink jcx1g3102@sneakemail.com .
