For those of you who don't know where Indianapolis is (or even Indiana, for that matter), it's in the heart of this fine country -- snuggled just over the mountains, south of the lakes, and north of the equator.  You may be wondering why I might want to visit "Indian-apolis" (root, Native American city) -- there's nothing there but Colts and, well, what is there?  The answer is in your pocket.  Well, it might be.  Dig around for some loose change and see if you can find an  urlLink Indiana quarter .  Clear off the pocket lint and take a look on the non-George Washington side.  What's there?  A race car, that's right.
 
 I'm going to go see some of the fastest automobiles on earth at the  urlLink US Grand Prix  this weekend.  This is the fourthUS Grand Prix to be held at the venerable  urlLink Indianapolis Speedway , and it also marks my fourth time attending.  If you're not familiar with  urlLink Formula One  cars, shame on you.  They are some of the most amazing machines on this planet, and largely drive the technology that you see in modern street cars today.
 
 The fantastic part of this years trip is that it will be the first time the race will have meaning.  In the past two seasons, the driver's championship has been all but won before the cars even arrive in the states.  This year is different.  Only three points separate seventy-five time champion  urlLink Michael Schumacher  (he hasn't won that many times, I guess) and the up-and-coming superstar  urlLink Juan Pablo Montoya .  It's age and experience versus youth and enthusiasm.  Ice cold precision versus brash aggressiveness.   urlLink Ferrari  versus  urlLink BMW .  It's going to be great!  See you when I get back.
