There is no real connection between the two, but the general media also provides its own bread and circus package, mostly in the form of fear-sex-bling bling.  Wealth, sex, invasions, moral superiority, and constant fear.  No stump speech can beat that.  Four more years on the way.  Time will tell if it's good or bad.  For myself, I always hope for good.  I'll take being wrong and everything turning out ok over being right and it all going to hell any day.  It would be nice if the various candidates took the same attitude.
