In other news, Jonny and myself have been resurrecting the flat. We abused our neighbours skips last night and the night before to get rid of all our street signs, life preservers, TV’s that haven’t worked since Nixon etc. and the flat is actually coming together nicely…  We re-arranged furniture and have put a bit more emphasis on The .Bar as well as building a shelf using nothing but bottles of JD. So hopefully the place will be spick and span come the party on Saturday night.. Now if only I could start getting to sleep at night.
