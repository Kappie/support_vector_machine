Turns out he doesn't think my opinion of him is very accurate.  I should say that everything I say in my blog is my personal opinion. If anyone has a problem with anything I post I will happily remove it or clarify what I am saying.  As it turns out I just received a text from "he who shall not be named". He has told me "You have one week to remove that stuff and with draw your comment. Or i will see you in court."[Sic] so I sent back a text to say that if he sends me an official request I will happily remove it. His response? "Text is official these days. The choice is yours. U should not have started this, it was too much to ignore"[Sic]  I'm not sure what he means by I should not have started this. Everything I wrote was written a long time ago and I find it funny he has suddenly decided to act on it if it is so serious and he knew about it for a long time, which apparently he has.  I'm also very dubious about the legality of SMS text messages as an official form of communication.  So said I am happy to remove the posts and I officially retract any posts I previously made about Josh. (Just realised I have to say his name to retract what I said about him before, oh well)
