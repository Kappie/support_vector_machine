I'd really prefer it when everyone can just watch quietly and just ask questions during the commercials or after the show. I don't care to what extent that you understood the show so far or anything. If you really wanna ask it. At least ask someone who is willing to answer, not distract others so you can get your answer. Maybe such demands are unreasonable, or maybe I myself would do it sometimes, but really ... I'm not in the mood to self reflect now. When I do cool down, I'll do it. Sheesh ... all this shitz over one stupid televesion show.
