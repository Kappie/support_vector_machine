This time I tried to install IRDA driver for the controlelr which didn't exist.. and it suffered a painful death...   There is no problem for me in reinstalling windoze except for its sick behaviour of overwriting MBR and i lose my grub Then it becomes really a pain to boot the other OS's installed on my machine without a floppy drive..  I will think of a permanent cure for this..
