Kevin  For the sake of American soldiers, a congressman is calling on news organizations to begin reporting the "other side of the story" in Iraq.     "It is one that demonstrates what can happen when people taste freedom," says Rep. Steve King, Iowa Republican, who has twice traveled to Iraq.     "And I can tell you firsthand that what is being reported by the mainstream media does not accurately reflect the day-to-day acts of goodwill toward the Iraqi people," he says. "I can tell you that what the troops told me did not sound remotely similar to the non-stop negative stories being promoted by the major media sources."     With Saddam Hussein no longer in power, the congressman cites more than 170 newspapers that are now being published in Iraq without restrictions on free speech. More than 3,700 schools have been renovated, he says, and more than 9 million new math and science textbooks printed and distributed "with the pro-Saddam propaganda extracted."     He calls attention to Iraq's new $1 billion healthcare budget â€” 25 times greater than the $16 million annual budget under Saddam's reign. Already, 85 percent of Iraqi children have been immunized.     "Why don't we hear any of this in the media?" Mr. King asks.
