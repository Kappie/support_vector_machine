And indeed, I found it. When I took it up, the clerk was a little surprised -- he said "oh, thats how you prononuce it -- Līvər rather than Lĭvər" (forgive me for the IPA, think  Lie-ver  rather than  Liver  for the first entry if it helps). But its funny how easy it is to slip on these little examples, especially in a case where the word "live" has more than one pronunciation depending on whether it is a verb or an adjective, and in both cases it is an absolute so that the use of an "-er" or  "-est" addition is really inappropriate. It was therefore an intentional play on words, and kind of a clever one (except for the fact that no one seems to know about it, including the store clerk!). From the liner notes, on the back of the CD:     Dear Sir/Madame You hold in your hand all that remains of a single night's concert performed by  some band  and myself during the fall portion of the Squinternational tour in the year of our lord 1994 so if you're buying this because you weren't there to make an unauthorized recording you should know that this is not one of those so-called live albums where everything has been replayed and resung in the studio except some drums and an audience and even the audience has been enhanced to make it sound like a bigger crowd that's a whole lot more excited than they actually were because this album is so much liver than any live record you've ever heard that you can actually close your eyes and pretend you were one of the paying thousands who watched me sing and fall over every night both of which I did on purpose even though the falling over part hurts more than the singing part so if you can't take the naked truth of a live concert with occasional bad notes and buzzes and feeback of the undesirable variety then go buy some Yanni so-called live record but I guarantee you when you close your eyes he won't sing and fall over because it might mess up his spacesuit. Your friend, Steve      Well, the meaning of "Liver" is quite unambiguous when you read the notes, unless of course you are a prescriptive grammarian who is too distracted by the misuse of the language (and of course the the fact that the whole note above was a single run-on sentence!).  He goes on, inside the non-Jewel case (Aimee Mann hates those things, too -- a hatred I have also managed to acquire after carefully considering the well-thought-out arguments), to define the "some band" which he referred to in the notes [emphasis mine]. And I realized in reading all of this why I like Steve Taylor so much. Because he is like me, except more clever. He has the same sardonic wit (except witier), the same intelligence (except more intelligent), and he has a sense of humor (I have humor, but no sense of it). I certainly don't share his religious faith, and I wonder to some extent how much that faith has hurt his career ("God rock" seems out of style for many). But I can respect it, and him.  I realized that there is a common thread in the music that I like. I like the songs that are clever, in part because they make me feel clever for liking them. As if the singer/songwriter and I are sharing a joke each time. And maybe we are, whether I know them or not.   I'll close with the lyrics to another song that Steve co-wrote, called "Tale of the Twister" (you can find it on the Soundtrack to  Pump Up The Volume , CD version only). The band (Chagall Guevara) was pretty great too, though I think that is mostly Steve's influence. You can definitely feel it in their albums....      She was a cool blue redhead She was a virgin vixen She had the eyes of Lassie She had the lips of Nixon Lips like Tricia Nixon   I stole a sideways glance at her continental shelf And I know she was the devil himself   It's a barstool yawn to a stuttered come-on It's a dirt road rut, She said, "Button up, mister" I shook as she took another look "Have you ever been hooked," she said, "By the tail of the twister?"   And with a brain like Einstein And with a form like sin Up on the roof of Trump Tower She said, "It's yours on a trade-in" (Think about it)   She was drawn to blood like a lean loan shark A tornado to a trailer park   It's a long black car It's power like a czar It's temporary bliss It's like kissing your sister Big wheels and you're feeling real fine It's a temporary ride On the tail of the twister   Big, big wheels And you're sitting real high It's a temporary ride On the tail of the twister   Cars and girls It's the details of design Another bait and switch game That hooks me everytime (And it's payday)   After sleeping with the devil you'd love to close the book But you gotta wonder how the baby's gonna look   It's a wide-eyed steal It's another New Deal It's the whore before the cart My head's starting to blister She said, "You could be the envy Of everyone you envy" It's the tail...   It's a long black car It's power like a czar It's temporary bliss My head's starting to blister I got took as she took another look "Have you even been hooked," she said "By the tail of the twister?"   Recorded by Chagall Guevara.  Written by L. Arthur Nichols, Dave Perkins and Steve Taylor  (c) 1990 MCA Publishing/GMMI/Sadoshrimp (ASCAP)      Every time I listen to it I am amzed at how many clever phrases there are in a song with a running time of 3:21. Its cleverness I cannot use myself to seem more clever (how often can one talk about a woman being the "whore before the cart" without getting slapped?). But thats okay, it is just cleverness being shared, no sin in that....
