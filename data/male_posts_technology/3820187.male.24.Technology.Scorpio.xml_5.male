Cooker bhoolna mat ..sab bhoolna magar cooker nahi ..(Dal banane ke liye)    * All food items in Check in Baggage NOT in cabin baggage.    * Take two xerox copies of all pages of Passport including Work -Permit (Ticket also , just in case )  keep one copy in hand baggage and one in check in luggage (This is for worst case in case passport gets stolen)    * Take few passport pictures also ( she might need her for her office ID card , nahi toh she has to run around for shops)    * Carry some coins if possible ( though it is tough to get in India  ) because phone booth mein sirf  coin chalega nahi toh she can buy anything from airport can get the change as well    * While cashing  Travellers cheques( if she has given) in Bank , make sure u have ur signatures on it and carry passport along with that to Bank    * DO NOT leave luggage alone whenever she is in International airport.    * Get all the stuff which is necessary for intial one month .. like Soap,Deo n all .. because it will take a while for her to find the nearest Supermarket.      *  yeah !! keep atleast two pair of clothes in Cabin/Hand Baggage .. its is because ..sometimes the baggage gets delayed ( which happens rarely) atleast she will  have somethin to wear for atleast two days to office :-))    *  DONT  keep any sharp object in hand luggage like nail -cutter or scissor etc    * Keep one pen with you because she has to fill some forms immigration in India as well in London Heathrow
