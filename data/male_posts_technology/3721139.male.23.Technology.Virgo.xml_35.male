But we've grown distant in the past couple months, and Misty says she's half-n-half about it.. which I think means 'take it out' in girl-speak (but I'm not that good at girl-speak, translators are welcome).  It feels really wierd not having a couple balls in my mouth. Metal. ::pulls out a red card:: Mind, Gutter, break it up.  *sigh* just as well, I'll be able to lick ice cream without trenching it or worrying about chipping my teeth. ;)
