As with most things, if you want to get a good idea of an entities reasoning for taking an action, follow the money.  I saw many pieces of infomration back in January and February listing the reasons behind France's, Germany's, and to a lesser extent Russia's opposition to the then proposed military actions against Iraq.  They were the top three countries in oil exploration and refining in Iraq, violating many of the UN sanctions against Iraq.  They knew that any change in the government of Iraq would likely cost them those lucrative contracts, rights, and infrastructure.  So they opposed it.  I'll try to locate the information I saw back then and post it here.  Now they are complaining that we won't let them benefit again on the backs of the Iraqi's.  Additionally, I would bet, but don't know for sure, that the money for this work is coming from the US and maybe the UK.  Why would either country want to give this money to someone else who opposed the action to begin with?  Childish?  Most definitely, but it is reality.  Now, if you can show me some work that a) will not be done in a timely fashion because there are not enough companies to do the work or b) only a company from one of those countries is qualified to do, I will have a problem with it.  Otherwise, you reap what you sow.  As an add on to b), the only thing that I comes to mind right off hand is nuclear material clean up.  France would be good at this since they provide a large percentage of their power through nuclear power, and are pretty good at dealing with the waste.  But, since Iraq does not have a nuclear program, I guess that rules that possibility out.
