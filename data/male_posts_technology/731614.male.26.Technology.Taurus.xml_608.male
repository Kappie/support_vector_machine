I hate taking it up the ass from the systems. This Australian academic I know is going on a research trip to Darwin for three months and invited me to come as his concubine. I should be applying to graduate schools and saving money as a marketing assistant (even typing it makes me cringe) while I can. But my life is so dull it makes the idea of going walkabout almost viable.Except that I would be in a dependant position and I'm sure I would take to watching bad australian television, drinking during the day while he's out doing his grant related stuff, and getting all nasal and bitchy because I spent all my money on a fool's errand. But then again, why the fuck not? God damn, wouldn't I rather be making out atop Uluru than calculating profit margins? But I would return to California in three months jobless and destitute, and would it be worth it? I've already accumulated all these experiences that are disjointed and lead nowhere. I feel like a house built by a paranoiac--all these rooms you can't reach, no flow, nothing is plumb.But I'm bored and I miss Australia. I haven't been there in sixteen years.
