Going to do something unconventional to celebrate Valentines Day.  Think a party that's totally out of the box.  Yeah. We also talked about these two statements: 1 - The church of God has a mission in the world. 2 - The God of mission has a church in the world. Which one is right and why? It made for some good discussion, especially after we framed them and talked about the previous four launches and which ones were relevant to statement #1 or #2. Just for the record, #2 is really the right one.  Debate among yourselves in the comments...
