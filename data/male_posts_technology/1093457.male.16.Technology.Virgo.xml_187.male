Every newspaper I have lokoed at today has the space shuttle on the front weather it be the picture of it breaking up or the crew but its there, theres a story, they are remembering. What does the daily star have? Zoe Ball and Norman Cook. Bloody outrageous and very respectaful. I may write and complian or email the bbc with my view.
