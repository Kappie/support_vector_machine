"The Trikke is an innovative three-wheeled vehicle that takes the best of the popular vehicles of today and combines them into a completely new machine in form, function, and riding experience. The Patented technology makes it possible for a rider to propel the Trikke forward without pushing or pedalingâ€¦just rock and roll. In describing the movement, it is often compared to in-line skating or skiing on pavement because the entire vehicle leans in unison due to it's finely coordinated cambering mechanism."  And now in my own words ... The Trikke brings together the graceful carving action of skiing and the dynamics of inline skating. Nuf Said.  But don't take my word for it ... see for your self.  urlLink http://www.trikke.com
