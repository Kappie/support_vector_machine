Got raised all in by #3, called by #4. Everyone else folds. Get a nice flop. No high cards. Bet hard. All in for #4. Call. Tripple up on the turn. River is nothing. Sir is up $35 in about 5 minutes. Sweet! Now only $965 to go! Wahhhh! heh. Oh well.. Nice to have a good session.   *** UPDATE: Left the $25NL with $66 in hand. Nice little session. Then went to a .50/1 for some safe small action. First hand is Poket Rockets. Raised full 4 bets. Flop is a dangerous 223 with two clubs. This round is bet up to 3BBs. Next card is A. Sweet! Someone caught there runner-runner flush. Made about $40 in 1 hand in .50/1. Maybe I have been avoiding the 10 person tables for no good reason. I really like playing 6 sided, but hmm..
