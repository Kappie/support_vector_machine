I'll append this post with a fairly long approximation of the day, but it'll take a bit to write, so sit tight.  In the mean time, pictures have been uploaded to  http://members.lycos.co.uk/ccbyg    Painting etc...   On the way over to the Cornelius Community Baptist, I called Cam who had just woken up and invited him to come with me, but he unfortunately he couldn't. Once I got there, I checked the first room (which will become the worship room, but I didn't know that yet), then had a bit of trouble getting into the second room - one of the doors was locked and the other was blocked closed ... I called Mary who didn't answer then it dawned on me to knock. (lol) I did, the door opened and in the room painting were Mary, Jamie, Danie, Jon, Lenny and Alex.  Right after I got there, we switched back to the other room because we'd ran out of red paint for the moment and Over the next hour or so I learned why we were getting the rooms ready to be used - Mary and Lenny have basically taken it upon themselves to start a youth group. I'm pretty excited about it, we've already gotten a lot of it planned out and we're working on the rest - pretty good for an idea that was though up last week. (lol)  At some point Lenny, Jamie and I went out to get some more red paint and met Melissa coming in as we were leaving to go to Ace Hardware. She had her camera with us and all the pictures I'm going to post were taken by it. Speaking of pictures, a while after we got back, Lenny went out and got pizza, and we took a break to eat and take these pictures: (hover your mouse over all the pictures in the post for title)                             btw, the piece of wood that Lenny's hanging off of in "the Lenny Scale" is a broken tire swing. - This happens to currently be my background.    We went back inside and continued painting. Lenny could have almost been on a first-name basis with the employees of Ace for the number of times he had to go back there, but we finally got the rooms looking perhaps not we had planned, but good anyways. Here are some pics of us painting the to-be Game Room:                                        We were originally going to paint these three sides of this room red and one side light green (color of the other room) and then use the green to make the red a plaid, but we eventually decided to go with that blue for one wall and continue using red for the other three. The last paint trip Lenny took, Ace got the shade of red a bit off, so after we touched up the wall, we realized that we could clearly see the difference between the old red and the new. We decided to use handprints to draw attention away from the errors on the wall and it worked out quite nicely. The last picture here is the Worship Room and some stuff that's been donated to our fledgling youth group.               After we were finally done for the day, we sorta lounged around while Abby and Jamie washed all the stuff off. Our excuse was that there was only one sink, but in reality, we did do almost as much work as them, cleaning up upstairs, we were just done faster. (lol)               For some reason Abby and Jamie started running around outside, pretending to fight and Lenny ran after snapping pictures. It went on for like ten minutes - was pretty funny.               Once we had locked up, we went back around the front, signed each other’s already-painted shirts and took a group picture.             We left and went to Izzy's where Mary's dad was treating us to dinner... On the way there Becky called me and I invited her to come to the youth group when we start it. At one point I noticed Lenny's car ahead of me and to the left, signaling and people waving at me from inside. Eventually I figured out that they wanted me to fall into the lane behind then, and puzzled, I did so knowing full well that both out lanes were turning ahead and that the one I was in would have been faster. I was on the phone though and didn't feel like making a mistake and having to turn around if for some reason I was remembering the road wrong. (lol)  Once we got to Izzy's we were pretty loud and obnoxious. (I think anyway - lol) Oh, and we were REALLY slap-happy - made for a strange time.                                   Yeah, that was a really fun day...
