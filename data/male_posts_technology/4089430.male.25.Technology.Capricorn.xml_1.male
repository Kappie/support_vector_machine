However, I am making this concession in order to submit to my  urlLink wife  who is teaching me to be more approachable (please, don't tell me if it's working or not).  Incidentally, I'm teaching her how to be ruder at the appropriate times.  Anyway, I don't expect this blog to last long, but while it does, I hope that you, dear Internet, will in some way come to know me as well as I already know you.
