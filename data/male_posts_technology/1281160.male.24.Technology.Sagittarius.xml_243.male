I also noticed that a few of us have subscribed using multiple ids. I know I am repeating it once again. But please use the Yahoo id alone. So, Ramgopal (3 ids), Vijay (2 ids), Manny (2 ids), and Valli (2 ids), please change your preferences to your yahoo id. I am willing to extend any help in this matter. Let us be an example of an interactive group. Expecting your cooperation.   I have decided to involve myself in the msitmmb group again. Since Rini might not be able to find time during the next few weeks, I decided to continue the work.  Other than that, got a lot of office work to do...
