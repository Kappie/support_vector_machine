At least I was crushed because it was of course not _my_ idea.  It was my partner's idea.  I've pretty much resigned myself to the end now.  I feel alone.  I still have a girlfriend, but I know that the relationship is on its death bed.  It's only a matter of time.  
 
 Of course, I've sensed this day coming for a while now.  Thus, Sunken Fog.  I was desperate to save the relationship.  Despite two years of separation, I still felt that it was right and that she was the one.  The one with whom I want to start a family.  The one with whom I wish to share everything.
 
 There is a shread of light peeking through the door frame...there is hope.  I've boiled the situation down to two fundamental questions:
 
 1.) Do we still love each other? and
 2.) Are our lives compatible enough for this to work?
 
 The answer to question number one will hopefully be answered this coming weekend.  She and I are going to spend a three day weekend in upstate NY -- exploring each other (Do I still know this person?), exploring ourselves (Am I being fair and honest with myself and where I want to go in life?).
 
 Answer number two, unfortunately, is all but answered.  She is an ambitious, snobby, and sometimes selfish person.  I can say these things because she herself has said them to me.  The problem is that we are young.  And neither of us is really willing to allow our career ambitions to become subservient to the other's.  This is a problem.  I can't move down to VA unless I know that we can make our careers work together, and it's looking more and more like it's not going to happen.  At least, it looks like she's not willing to make it happen.  There's no compromise.  I am willing to make sacrifices to a certain degree.  She is not willing to sacrifice a thing.  So I have my doubts (serious doubts). 
 
 The saga continues...
