I give it 3 stars, it was nice to have 2 rooms, 2 beds, 2 tv's, and a kitchen. The reason though for taking away 2 stars, was that, it was near Traffic, so it was hard to leave. Also, the comunity wasn't all spectacular. And while the hotel was nice, it did show some age. So, for a low price hotel for a prolonged stay, that should suffice your needs.
