I woke up early... wrote a poem... was written a poem... and then went out with Brady. No, not in some wrong sense.  Brady came and picked me up around 2:30pm... I wasn't sure of what to wear... well, actually I had just gotten out of the shower a bit earlier and didn't have a shirt on yet. I don't think it's anything Brady hasn't seen, so whatever.  ANYway... we had decided the night before we were going to get a new love interest for him, on a limited budget... the answer was unanimous. He needed a new computer. So, we first went to CompUSA to look at parts... mostly cases and power supplies, but we priced other things as well and decided that Fry's would be a bit cheaper for the rest. So we got a pretty nice case, with blue LED lit collums and a nicely lit power supply as well. Then off to Fry's we headed.  Man... it was raining hard when we got there.  So, we went in and figured out where in the store to get what we wanted, then got the help we needed (they have to make an order thing for it)... so we were talking to the guy and told him we wanted 512 MB of ram (and the kind that allowed for the full 800mHz system bus)..... he started a list of ram on the computer screen... and it looked to us like he was trying to somehow swindle us out of hundreds... but that was explained and yeah... it all worked out. We were about to go up and pay when Brady realized he didn't have the checkbook for the account we were planning to get the stuff on... but it all worked out in the end. So, we got the board in one trip (and oh were we happy), then the processor and ram after a short lunch at McDonald's.  Then we went back to Brady's, for three and a half hours of installation. Oh joy... I live for that stuff, so of course I did it. So, we got in the board, ram, power supply, stickers, drives, and other random cool stuff, and flipped on the switch, and after a little work, it all turned on and looks really cool, and works really well.  So, Brady now has a new computer with a 2.8GHz Pentuim 4 processor with HT, a VERY nice Intel Motherboard with the newest Chipset and onboard gigabit ethernet (along with that 800Mhz Bus! And 512kb Cache!), 512MB of DDR400 Ram, some lights, a nice case, and then an old HD that needs replaced in the not too distant future. The ending cost for this major upgrade? $630... not high at all! And it was fun, so it's all good.  I'm going to go now, putting Debian on the mac....
