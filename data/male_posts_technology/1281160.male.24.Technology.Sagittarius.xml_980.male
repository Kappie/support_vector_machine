Second Colin made himself into the Infy BandWangon... All the best for his forecoming challenges...  This blog is regarding my mail accessibility... As I am in Cisco project our network is separated from infy's, so rarely I do check my infy mails during office hours... So pl. dont expect quick reply for those mails...  S, its an apt quote, quoted especially for people like us reg. commn..... Coming to "The hunger of Beauty", I also do agree that instead of spending crores in decorations and functions we can spend towards hunger, but it should remove poverty ultimately instead of motivating beggars to be lethargic coz nyway there is someone to give food...  Got lots of work... will come later  Cheers
