It actually makes you pissed off but glad that at the same time things are over.  Some people find it necessary to encode things for the other party's protection well guess what sweetie, the jig's up.  I guess you had a great time with the date huh?  There are also people who are close to the other side of the equation that say things that really make you think about what has happened.  No names mentioned but seriously, I was just something that someone could control during a very chaotic time in someone's life and thrown away like a bad habit?  I was a fucking puppet and I played my part masterfully.  The rebound guy I suppose.  I can't complain, I took the risk and played with fire and I actually got burned.  One would think that after the previous and the following that one would learn from that and I did.  This was just a little bit different.  It's really unbelievable that people could be so cold about things.  That people think very little of people.  Wow.  If this was really true then the whole thing was just a sham.  I was thinking about calling you to see if you wanted to meet up here in Chicago before you left for Japan.  Now, I don't know what to think.  I had a beautiful picture painted in my head where we saw each other in O'Hare for a nice talk and a perfect good bye.  Then again, I would just be putting the effort of missing work, driving up to the airport to see you while you just don't do anything.  Besides, I don't think you even want to see my anymore.  You did go on that date.  It sucks learning about what really happened and what really was.  It brings back old feelings.  Now I really feel wronged and for that, why don't you go ahead and fuck off.
