Haiz ... not the first time I've seen / heard of this. A bit too much sometimes.  This morning I called up the SPF. Had some disappointing news lor. The lady on the line said that they'd already replied to shortlisted candidates. If I've not gotten anything it means that I'd not been shortlisted. I was really keen to enter this batch of intake because it's in Mar 04. 9mths of training will end around Dec 04. Anyway, I asked for the next intake which is in Jun/Jul. Recreuitment will start as early as Feb. Looks like I have a good 2 mths before my next application and 6 mths or so to the intake date if I'm successful. Hope things will work out fine this time.  In the meantime, I'm going to have to take up another job first. Hmm ... I wonder what's available and suitable...  Today's Aikido at BB East was pleasant. Didn't feel like I absorbed a lot a lot though. Ah Hee Sensei was there as well. At the end, paired with  urlLink Eileen  again for kokyuho. ARGH!!!... again I can't grasp what I'm doing wrong. I can feel my upper arms getting tired so I was using strength instead of actually doing it the right way. Still, can't get my iriminage to work properly though, but I tried the 'keep your' hands in front' thing and it kinda helped a bit.
