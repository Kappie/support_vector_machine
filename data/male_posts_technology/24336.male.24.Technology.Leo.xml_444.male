Since the couple was supposed to be back last night, Carolyn went home.   She got a phone call around 11 PM from the FIRE MARSHALL.     It seems that the dryer caught on fire and burned up half of the basement.  They found her cell phone number on a note upstairs and called her.   Luckily the fire caused a water pipe to rupture, helping quench the flames.  She was okay, the cats were okay, no one was hurt.   More luck for that family.
