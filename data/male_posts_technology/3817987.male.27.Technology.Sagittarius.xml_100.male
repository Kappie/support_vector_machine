While it wasn't as good as the original it was still a great film and in some ways a more complete and cohesive film.  All the changes worked and some really improved the weakness of the original.  There was nothing as brilliant as the Ladies' Garden Society scene though.  Denzel was great as was Meryl Streep.  Robyn Hitchcock was great in his small role and almost stole the show with his weirdness.  This was one of the few remakes that was worth making.  I wouldn't be surprised to see this film in my year end top ten list.  Also  Harold and Kumar  was an excellent stoner comedy!
