First time i have ever stayed up 20 hours and hopefully it will be the last. We got donuts and then i left. After a hard night talking about abortion and why they brought out a quija board. I went home and slept. Until now.........4 o clock. I took some pictures that i will post on the net once they're developed. Charles and zach both had small power naps and the rest of us (including me) jwe're passing around the bottled caffine waiting to go home. It seems like it was 5 years ago and only lasted an hour........well i've only slept for 8 hours this whole year.
