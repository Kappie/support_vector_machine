This week is really cool! We only have Mon. (B day) and Tue. (A day) for school, and then we have Thanksgiving Break for 5 DAYS! IT is AWESOME! I'm having a sleepover with Zach on Tuesday night, and we are having Thanksgiving brunch at Mamie's house on Thursday, and then early Friday morning, we are going to drive 4 HRS to Grandma and Papa's! Plus the next school week after that favors B days (B,A,B,A,B). And my website is being RE-DONE, so you can check it out (IT IS REALLY COOL) @ http://geoffmyers1.tripod.com! Thanks a lot and I hope you have a Happy Turkey Day! ;-)
