But it becomes unfeasible most of the times... my Grandpa used to go for every Concerts, he can.... at times I have also joined him during my school days..  yeah, jax, when u say music (western  classical) can be one and the same... but when u say song.....(western.... Michael Jackson, Shakira..etc...) r entirely different from Indians (yesudas etc....)  yesterday I saw a superb fantastic classical musical film (only 2 CD's till. one more CD I have to see today...) all r waiting for the name... know...  Its 20th century fox production "The sound of Music" superb yeah.. ultimate story, well designed...  "Rodgers  Hammerstein...." Hope Jax would have seen it earlier...  By way have a look at this site... Fantastic one...., "www.hotbar.com"...  nothing more, update u later... bye take care... Ram
