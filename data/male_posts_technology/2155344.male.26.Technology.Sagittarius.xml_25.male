     
      is building up, leading to monday's WWDC in San Francisco. Rumor sites are rife with rumors, here's some of the top ones -  1. New LCD displays (a new 30" widescreen is expected to be introduced at $2999, prices on 20" and 23" LCDs are to be dropped). The new displays are to drop ADC and embrace DVI.  2. A G5 iMac in a new enclosure - the rumors point to a new design with the logic board behind the LCD. Its hard to see how Apple can lift sales higher than the current iMac without a major price reduction. 3. There has to be at least one significant iPod - related announcement. There are no solid reports about this though.   Of course, Apple has been on a roll recently. After Airport Express, they have launched iTunes in Europe, new PowerMac G5s, Remote Desktop 2.0 and iPod connectivity for BMWs. Stock prices are hovering around highs and at least a couple of analysts have increased their target prices. Apple mania has set in. Watch this space next week :)     And oh yeah, the next version of OS X - OS X.4 (Tiger) will be previewed too.
