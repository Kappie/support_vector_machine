But a good customer and friend of mine called me today - that was overdue.  His company has agreed to fund my robotic automation projects for the construction materials industry  if  the numbers look right (which I am still working on).    Other friends called me to invite me last minute to a bachelors party - just not feeling it tonight  -shrug-   I found out my only living grandmother is in the hospital with pneumonia.  I still have to call her. Last time I saw her she was in bed and was taking a nap.  I was saying goodbye to her as I left for PA.  I thought she felt feverish and mentioned it, but she said she was just tired. Guess there was reason for concern after all.  Sad and worried about all that. hrmmm.  My sister, Marisa,  confirmed she'll be driving over here to the 'burgh to come to my party - yea!  My friend Alain called me back.  He owns a few resturaunts in Pittsburgh and New York.  Looks like he'll be coming, too!  One of my interns is driving all the way over from Ohio.  All good news.  Oh! This is funny... went to trim the hair over my ears a little yesterday and slipped.  Yep... little bald spot right above my left ear so I had to wear my glasses last night (but they're cool).  Anyway... went to get an emergency cut today and you can't tell it had happened looks nice, though my regular hair stylist was off today so I had to get it done by someone else.  He did a good job. Oh well. Sorry, Marlene.  My friend Kate Deeley got me a google gMail account. So that was also pretty cool.    What else... helped my neighbor with her computer a little bit and also worked a bit.  I did not get a lot done with the softwate today, unfortunately. booo!  Oh yeah... I finally put together my new weight set!  Now I realize I just need heavier weights.  I'm really motivated and psyched because I build quickly.  And then I saw  urlLink this guy 's site... he documents his whole weight loss and muscle building history - very interesting.  I was suprised by how quick it happens.  Definitely going to be much bigger in 2-3 months, hehe. I lost 35 pounds over the last year and can't stand to lose much more weight.  Now it's time to build, baby!  Now I'm heating up some dinner and getting ready to meet friends out at ... DejaVu, of course. Where else, lately.  Think I still need to drink some more water.  Gonna be late gotto go...
