Ben, my life, my love, my sex pickle, you were correct in your second assumption, way back when. *Points to the bottom* I am sneaking on my computer, because I love you, and I didn’t even need to  sexually  coerce you into giving me the password! Hurrah! Anywhore, I have little to write about, but I figured I’d write anyway, just to show Ben that I care. Eric Drobile  makes me orgasm  rocks my socks, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. In other news, life sucks a dirty, dirty pickle. Alaska is in seven days, and I haven’t a clue as to what’s coming. GO ME! Right…um…nobody cares about what I have to say, so howzabout I give you a nifty little plug for everything that means something to me, eh? Okay, I see the way you’re gaping at me in horror, so I’ll refrain. Perhaps next time, okie? Okie. In closing, I love Ben. He is my sexy über-leet hacker sex pickle…thing. Oh baby? Oh baby. *Grin* Goodbye, nonexistent audience. Adieu and…er...yes.
