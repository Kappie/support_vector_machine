Best friends listen to what you don't say. --Unknown  Friendship is one mind in two bodies. --Mencius  I was just reading through some of the friendship quote  these are some of them that touched me. I felt I identify with these statements a lot. I guess I happen to be one of those lucky people who can confidently  proudly say that   "I have a best friend".    What can I say about my best friend? She's the best one can have. I have started feeling special from the time I have met her. I feel I can be myself with her around and there is no need for pretenses. She knows so much about me that if she wants she can blackmail me with it.. But I know she won't as she is a my best friend  she is someone I can trust.  We have had innumerable tiffs  quarrels. But the quarrels never last for more than 5 minutes  the friendship has grown stronger than ever. There have been moments of doubts as what would happen when we are no longer in the same town or place. But I feel friendship does not obey the physical boundaries. Its like:  "Once a friend, always a friend".  We will always be friends as long as I live.
