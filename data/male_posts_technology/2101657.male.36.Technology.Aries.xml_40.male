We had our CubScouts out camping this weekend. It was a huge success I feel. Course, it could of been warmer over-night (no issues, the kids had bedding, and a double-barrel wood stove to keep them warm), and I will next time make sure to NOT plan the camp-out on the weekend of Day Lights Savings time. The oldest son had to get up at 6:45 adjusted time Sunday morning.  One thing led to another, and 98% of the scouters decided to get up at that time too.  I decided to "lay-in" and got up at 7:15, with the last 3 other people.  It was still too early, as in my opinion, it was only 6:15.  Made for a long tiring morning. We got the boys all fed, got the cabin cleaned up, so it was nicer looking then when we arrived. We got the outsides picked up, took 2 pics of the all the scouts who attended, and then headed out the gate.  At least this year I didn't have a cow act like it wanted to slam it's front hooves on my hood.  In the afternoon, we went down (just our family) to the new Dubuque County Jail, for a public tour. It's taken, like forever, to get this jail finished, but I must say, it is pretty impressive.  It's only the 2nd jail I've ever had a tour off, and it was #1  lol  Very interesting designs.  I was really surprised to notice, that there were cameras  EVERYWHERE , but in the stair wells. That seems like an obvious place, since it takes a key to operate an elevator.  It's actually 71degrees here!  Can't wait, means every day will soon be like this, and it'll be time to hit the frisbee golf course over by Veterans Memorial Park off Kane St.  It's a really awesome course, but it  WILL  give you a work-out, as just like everywhere else in Dubuque, it's full of hills.
