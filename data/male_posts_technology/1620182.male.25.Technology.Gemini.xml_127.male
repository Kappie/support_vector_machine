 I was wondering why there are no documents that succinctly describe the problems faced by the current administration (and by administration, I obviously mean President Bush and his group of merry cronies).  After discussing it with a friend from NC, I have to come to the conclusion that the Republicans don't want such a record circulated.  Maybe this is obvious to most, but please stay with me because I lean toward naive.  
 
 Obviously, controlling knowledge controls opinion, and the republicans need control more than ever.  I really look forward to the presidential debates to see how Bush tries to spin his first four years in office.  I mean, what has he done for us as a nation?  I can see some sort of weird television internal monologue thing now...
 
  In Bush's stupid cowboy twang:  "Well, first of all, I'm the elected president, which means that the simple majority of people liked me in 2000."  --  WRONG 
 
  "I passed the biggest medicare reform ever -- something not even your beloved intern molester could do."  --  And your consituents can't even figure out how to use it.  A medical system that exists to make a profit will never provide adequate health care to those who truly need it. 
 
  "Tax cuts.  They seemed to help."  --  Yeah, they helped your buddies, "the haves and have mores" while helping to build the deficit back up to where your daddy left it. 
 
  "Okay, forget domestic issues then.  Let's talk foreign policy.  I pulled out of all those stupid treaties.  We don't need our pollution or ability to shoot down missiles governed by international agreements.  We're our own country and we answer to no one."  --  Way to start out strong.  Now everyone's pissed at us. 
 
  "My hallmark will be fighting terrorism.  I'm really kicking some behinds."  --  Okay, so this stuff wasn't even on the radar screen until 9/11.  You didn't even meet with your anti-terrorism staff until after that horrible day.  Since then you have completely botched the attach on Afghanistan, letting the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden slip away because you couldn't afford to commit troops to that country for fear of not having enough for your real objective... 
 
  "And this Iraq war has been great for the war on terrorism.  My long term strategy to convert the evil-doers to an axis of democracy is going to pay off."  --  Uh, huh.  So this is your strategy.  Come in, remove an already teetering, toothless enemy who thwarted your daddy, and then leave a standing army in the midst of some of the holiest sites in all of Islam?  This is supposed to end the problems of the middle east?  Did anybody tell you that the reason Osama Bin Laden is flying planes into buildings is because there was a standing US army in Saudi Arabia?  Now you've inserted a cardboard cutout government, propped up by a US military that is growing more and more weary of an increasingly violent insurgency?  I can tell you had a plan for bombing and taking control of this land.  What was your plan for after that again? 
 
  "Okay, enough about my cowboy ways.  You must realize that I've created over 2 million jobs over my administration's term."  --  But how many did you lose in the first place?  And I'm sorry, but the "job starts" are not what we need.  How many part time jobs does this number include?  And just the fact that everyone's unemployment checks have stopped does not mean that less people are unemployed or under-employed.
