I'm glad no one was harmed in the incedent and in the last post i was kind of over reacting. I found a place in tyler called "the arena" or something like that. They have lan partys and you can play video games there for 5$ bucks an hour. Kind of a rip off but well i could meet alot of people. There website is http://www.arenatyler.com/yabbse/index.php   I have been waiting to watch xplay all day but its on at 11 and i woke up before the first episodes this morning. I am pretty happy with my new tv I checked and its only 20 in but thats better than 16 or 10. I should go to a pawn shop and buy one of those small tv's so i can play games in the car. I could probably get it really cheap but the shops are closed tomorow because of sunday. I picked up an atari thing that you plug into the tv and you can play 10 games. I got it for my birthday a while back. And i havent touched it in a while. I am glad they didnt steal it. but you can get them at wal-mart for 20 bucks. well i am off to do stuff. or maybe not.  i am going anyway..........
