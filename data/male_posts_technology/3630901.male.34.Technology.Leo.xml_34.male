I remember feeling like I made a big mistake and that I wanted to get out.  I think I kept having those kind of thoughts for about 5 years.  When I think about that, I think that maybe a higher power was communicating through my poetry, but I ignored it.  I remember being very unhappy in the marriage.  In August 1993, I moved to connecticut In November 1993, we announced our intention to get married On 12/4/1993, I wrote Flash in the Pan, about love burning brightly at first and then fading, and me leaving.   On 2/16/1994, I wrote Lost Shoes, about searching for a new path, and temptation to get away On 10/10/1994, I wrote Union about our marriage and relationship (positive, for public consumption) On 10/15/1994, we got married.  I remember thinking that if it doesn't work out I could always get a divorce On 6/24/1995, I wrote Dark Reflections, about dwindling passions, time passing us by, dreams becoming memories On 8/12/1995, I wrote Secret Writings [Part I], about whether it's better to leave someone or to die.  On 8/24/1995, I wrote Clarity, about someone coming to me and telling me that  it's up to me  and that  it's my life .  I remember thinking about divorce then. On 9/17/1995, I wrote two - Divided and Mask.  One about how different L and I were, and one about how I had already fled the relationship. On 9/19/1995, I wrote They Slept On, how we knew of our differences but both decided to ignore them and try to keep it together.  There were other poems, too reflecting a general feeling a disquiet, between 1996 and 1999 -- but they were vaguer and I can't specifically point to them and say they were about my relationship.  Did I become comfortable, or did I feel I'd said all there was to say?  So then I think about how my poetry dwindled after that.  Like the muse had tried to tell me things, but I decided not to heed the voice.  Then in 1999, we decided to adopt.  For me, at that point, everything changed.  Somehow things were more positive (I guess).  I stopped writing poetry until 2002, writing 3, and then stopping again until I wrote two last week.  So as I look back on my marriage, and on past relationships, I think about how I pull out of a relationship, emotionally, mentally, but I don't take the steps to end it.  It's like I'm just waiting the other person out.  It's been a bit of an eye-opener for me.  Maybe I'll post these poems.  Depression = rage turned inward.  That makes perfect sense.  I wanted to get out of the relationship, didn't do anything about it, and was angry with myself for letting it go on as long as it had.
