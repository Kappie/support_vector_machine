Like sometimes I just have these weird ideas pop into my head, or moments of inspiration, and I have nowhere to record them. Well I guess this'll be as good a place as any. Besides, I may not be able to apply myself to work, but I can write drivel all day long.   Plus you know how sometimes you come across something that you think is really stupid but no one else seems to think the same way about it but you; which in turn makes you feel like this isn't really your planet and you were accidentally left here after some offworld picnic your alien parents decided to take you on? Now I may finally find out whether it's just me or it really is the rest of the planet who's nuts.
