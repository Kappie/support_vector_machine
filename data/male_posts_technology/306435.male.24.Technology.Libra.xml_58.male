I wwon our Fantasy Bowl as well as the Madden 2002 Super Bowl.  I have also been advised that Jackie would like a shout out.  Evidently she was wondering why Tanner would get some PR and she wouldn't...well I was protecting her from having to tell the story of her and Tanner making out, but oh well here is your pub.  Ann comes back to the Nati on Friday.  That is very exciting.    Oky...I am running out of things to write. If you think of something you want on my page let me know.
