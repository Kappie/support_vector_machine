I am watching  urlLink  Smallville   while typing this so it may be a little scatter in thought...  Halloween is tomorrow.  The pumpkins on the fromt porch has lasted two weeks and I for one is very impressed.  I thought for sure they would have been smashed 24 hours into the first weekend.  We are dressing up for work tomorrow.  Dave got us all doctor scrubs and lab coats.  We are going to be an ER, which I think is quite fitting in the computer scheme of things, but then again I am a geek.  Things at work are getting better with the new seat.  I feel like more of the team now, but I miss talking to Sue all day.  I went and saw "Don't Tell Anna" this weekend and then Ann had everyone over for a party.  It was a very fun party.  Ann has a very unique talent for meeting and getting to know really interesting and cool people.  I really like that about her...  So this would be a good time to send a shout out to our newest readers Judy, Ed and Eddie...well I guess they could read it to Eddie.    I haven't heard rom Kristin in awhile.  I have tried to stay active online so I could talk to her.  She is probably pretty busy.  She did update her  urlLink blog , but I didn't understand the post at all (ahmmm...that means Kristin send me an email)...  Okay, I am going to go finish watching Smallville...until then...
