Fallout 2  saw a lot more progression... its beginning to get to 'depression level' again.  This hapens occasionally with games that I play.  Let me explain.  Some games are very in-depth and detailed.  And if I play them enough, I suddenly realise I have an awful lot of stuff to do in the game, and this leads to my inherent laziness, and not actually wanting to do those tasks.  Fallout 2 managed to do this before.  The worst offender was  Planescape: Torment .  I got about 10 screens in, and then suddenly realised  everything  had an individual description.  Every item.  Every NPC>  realising just how much I had missed, I turned it off, uninstalled it and never played it again.  In other news, a RPG that has been delayed for months might actually begin this weekend.  I'll believe it when I see it.  Speaking of RPG's, my ideas for  Exalted  continue, but actually finding people to play is proving more tricky.  It seems my GMing appeals to a "selected" crowd, and others have no time / interest.  Hrrmph.  Watched some more  Transformers ... and I saw the episode "Kremzeek".  After the first 10 minutes, I was praying that it would end.  But it didn't... it seemd to go on forever.  It was the worst episode of a cartoon series I have ever seen... I wish it to be stricken from my memory.  Like Boobah.  WHAT THE F**K IS BOOBAH?  I mean, what are they?  Another odd RPG idea sprang into to my head, relating to this, based on an off-hand comment by my Mam.  What if the Teletubbies were the sole survivors of a nuclear war, locked away in their bunker, and then those Boobah things invaded?  It could make for a really odd RPG.  I should stop having ideas.
