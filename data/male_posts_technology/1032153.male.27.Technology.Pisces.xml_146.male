But I wasn't aware of it feeling a long time. It was pleasant so I wasn't thinking of the time too much.  2) I would love company Dan! We must work something out sometime. Also haven’t done Clevedon with you for a while. Let me know if you want to cruise there sometime.  3) And in answer to the perplexing question of the "About Me" being empty on the side there. I have nothing to say about me! No seriously though, I am aware of this issue. When I first put that there, I tried to add stuff about me, but it always ended up in a huge font, which was bigger than the 'about me', which seemed rather inappropriate. So I gave up in the end. But since I have a bit of time, and you have asked, I shall write what I think would have been there if I could have ascertained how the damn thing worked.  General Information:- I’m 23, work as a labbie in an ice cream factory, my trousers are becoming tight. Spend much time involved in Covenant Presbyterian Church Manurewa. Drive an alfa romeo 33ie, wish I had a brace of them. Want to buy a house very soon, single, when that changes would like to study at theological college to train as a pastor.   Likes:- The forest, the mountains, an orange sunset across an uninhabited plain. Bach is a legend, as is Beethoven. Brahms is the man. Bob Dylan is choice, Simon  Garfunkel are super great. Love to write music, and wish I spent more time doing it. Love to teach stuff to young people. Have a great passion for working with young people. CS enters high on the list of leisure activities. Enjoy writing spreadsheets which do things to save you time. Books on the list include the Bible, He is there and He is not silent, Lord of the Rings. Favourite movies include Braveheart, LOTR, and the original Star Wars trilogy. Enjoys reading other people’s blogs. Like tropical fish, especially now that they aren’t dying all the time.   Dislikes:- Ugly buildings, concrete jungles, rap music  and heavy metal music, (and I use the term music with a loose definition here), those who compromise on beliefs which they know to be right, people who argue against personal responsibility, the ridiculous farce which the treaty of Waitangi has become, the people who use this same treaty to rid themselves of responsibility for their own lives, dishonesty and disloyalty, arguments based on personalities rather than reasons, people being labelled in a derogatory fashion by the PC brigade in order that their views will be shut down.   Of course I am not a product of my dislikes and likes, but they do give ya'll an idea of where I come from. Also that's not a comprehensive list, but that's the general idea, you'll pick up the rest as we go.
