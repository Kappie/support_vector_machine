Life sucks, love sucks, i wish the dying part would come sooner. I'm not going to kill myself. Don't worry. Suicide is entirely selfish.  I actually tried, for once, to get my assignments in on time, and, i get worse grades. Damnit. I just dont understand. Every day, i feel more ignorant than the one before.  Yet, i put on a good face, and pretend that life's grand, and try to cheer everyone else up that is around me. I want to go to classen, but, my grades suck too much. I could  try  to get in on drama or tenor sax...but i dont want to go there for vpa. I'm not an artsy person. I would LOVE to learn how to play a few bebop songs on the tenor sax though...  I'm going to stop whining now. I hate it when i whine. I hate it when anyone whines. I'm the type of person that doesn't believe in whining. I believe that everything can be changed. My belief system is crumbling. Everything that i thought i knew, is wrong. All wrong. I guess i'll go try to make up a test, to make a worse grade than before, obviously. Meh, figures. I was just starting to feel good about myself, too. What with (thinking) that i had good grades, (thinking) that my father actually liked me for once.  All that is gone now. I feel like shit. I feel like a worthless pimple on the ass of society.   [Standing in line to see the show tonight, and there's a light on....heavy glow....by the way, i tried to say i'd be there, waiting for....Dani's the girl who's singing songs to me, beneath the marquee, of our souls, by the way, i'd try to say i'd be there...waiting for....you....]
