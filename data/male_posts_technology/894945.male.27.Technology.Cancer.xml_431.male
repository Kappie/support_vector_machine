Actually I did try and invite you - several times - but couldn't connect. That's the honest truth, i'm not sure if it was your mobile or mine.  Friday night was a good one, myself and Custard met up with Kirk "Captain" Truscott, and hit the Sports Bar. Actually the next few hours are a bit of a blur, but I remember about four bottles of Laurent Perrier pink being drunk, several fraggle girls being insulted, having a drunk conversation about hair with a girl from Turkey, (oh, those eastern european chicks... *dribble*) and eventually being in Liquid (the giant disco aspirin.. hi [)amien and Elly!). I later split and met up with somebody else, but code honor dictates that no details are revealed. :)  Anyway, I have noticed a somewhat lacking of our team spirit recently. People being off ill, tired, not invited (only joking) or just generally slacking. I have been guilty of this too, at times.   So to welcome in the longer days and warmer nights heading into springtime, it's time for the next TOASTER FILES SHIRT WEARING, NORMAL PEOPLE SCARING NIGHT OUT. It's this Friday, starting at Chateau Toaster Files, then heading into town. Time to be confirmed by Brettmiester general. Meal at theirs to meet PK's outlaws, then lock up your daughters as we head into town.  Be there, or be.. er.. somewhere else, that's not as much fun.
