So we got down at church at about 6:15, and made stuff. Oh yeah. It was kinda funny when I drove down, because I noticed some writing on my back window. Some lemon had written "0 - 60 1000 minutes". Now I'm quite fond of our old silver streak, so when I finally decifered the code (it was in three lines) I was rather perturbed. It's a good machine..... although not known for it's speed, it still is a cool car. Well, I'm off to get ready for church now.  God bless!
