To Honey's surprise, she was shocked when I have "extra" cash in my bank account.(I'll sincerely truthfullythankthe person, whom gave me the loan in order to fulfil part ofHoney's dream)She's overjoyed  I'm so happy to see the reaction on her face. Ordered the piano eventually  will be delivered on Friday (16th Jul 2004).. She's so excited about the piano arriving soon...
