Thats right, I happen to find pakistani humor outrageously funny. The inspiration for this little quip comes from a man i have known since 1st grade. His pakistani doctor parents were friends with my jewish dentist dad and since we lived close, went to the same school, it was only a matter of time before i was eating kashi and pad-see-u curry beef. Thanks Imran.  So I dont know if you realize this, but pakistani humor has been on the rise in this country. Sure it started off with a few minor roles, but it has really blossomed into something that adoring fans can laugh and play along with as these "foreigners" experience life in modern america.  Who was the first pakistani, decked out in head garb, strong indian accent, 8 babies, proprietor of his own business, the lord ganesh at his side to grace the pop icon stardom? Thats right, it was Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. This man has taken the lead role as america's most recognizable pakistani dude. His Kwik-E-Mart has appeared in tons of episodes and of course, Apu's quick wit, funny mis-pronunciation of the language, and hard worker vs. lazy american attitude have won him a spot in our hearts.     Since this list is being created on the fly, lets go to our next funny pakistani. His real name is Kal Penn and he was really born in Jersey, but lets pretend for a second that Taj Mahal Badalandabad from  urlLink National Lampoon's Van Wilder  is pakistani. This movie is one of the funniest generation Y movies that has come out in years...and what would it be without the help of the funny, wide-eyed lad from Banglapoor, India whose sole purpose of coming to America was:     "I came here to study the great American art of muff diving. To smack clam, munch rug, dine at just one American pink taco stand! You know, I wanted to, how is it, park the porpoise. You know? I want to take it through the car wash, baby. And get it waxed. I want to wax it. Wax it! You know, and air dry. Air dry that shit, yeah!"  Of course we could never make a list of funniest pakistani dudes in movies without  urlLink Samir Nagheenanajar , better known as samir nagana-nagana- not gonna work here anymore thats for sure. now even though his real name is Ajay Naidu and he was born in Illinois, he has mastered the not-knowing-english sense of humor that makes these characters so, so deep. top line from the movie is a tie between the kicking and punching of the paper jam or: Back up in your ass with the resurrection.     Perhaps this movie shouldnt even be mentioned considering i didnt see it. But i SWEAR that i said the whole pakistani thing before this movie was supposed to come out. So there is this movie called the Guru about an indian dude who comes to american and becomes an indian actor on the american (porn)screen. wow, this plot truly is full circle and stars an amazing amount of funny indian dudes in it.      Listen, I cant think of anymore right now (especially since Fez from 70s show is actually cast as hispanic) but you get the idea... indians/pakistanis are funny fucking people and they are going to be all over the american movie scene soon. i predict it. mark my words, etc etc. There is even a term coined for Indian actors on the big screen. Google it, Bollywood.
