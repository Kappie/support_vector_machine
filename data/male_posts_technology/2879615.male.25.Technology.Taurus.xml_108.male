Wonder if my neighbors heard the strength of "Shmee Shmopen SHMAH!" Yast orders some food from Vino's...of course it takes forever to be delivered. "I wish i had some stromboli in my pants". And we all felt bad for her when the Vino's guy called for directions and yast answers teh phone with "ARE YOU OUTSIDE?!?!??!" hahaha idiot. Also really funny was when la called and couldn't hear us talking but kept repeating "Can you hear me? For the love of god I have to TELL you something?!" 9 million times.   So the other night Kate comes up to TCNJ to relearn how to party right. Her andLa goto Rutgers to party with the boys and plan on coming back toE-wing before i got home from work. Well, idiot earlick boy pete gets arrested for underage drinking and hauled into the clinker.The best part is no one can post bail because he had a warrantout forhis arrest in Belmar so they had to waitforthe Belmar Po to show up...at 3am. Needless to say, it was a ridiculous night for the girls. The bust into Rutledge @6am with munchkins, tellinga story about Christina "Heygirls...just wanted to know if youfelt like coming to a party at my house...we've got some sausages that needbuns" HAHAHHAHA  AND my car door fell off. Can someone PLEASE pimp myride?  fuck reason smash
