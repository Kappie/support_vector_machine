I won't go on because I am sure you guys do not want to hear about my religious babble. Thank you for the invite Dave but on Sundays if I am not working all day I finish at 2. So can't come. Sorry.   General Studies exam: was ok. Missed a few of the sciency / mathy questions out but I anwsered the 40 mark one with tons of waffle. That usually works for me.  Template: I'll wait for votes from Max, Paul and Jackie before I decide weather we change or not. I think we may as we have had this layout since the blog begun.
