How come. btw guys, y dont u put ur current address which might be ur office address or current residential address updates on to our database. I could see some empty columns. I am planning to add one more column to the existing database with the column name, Office address. so do update that also to make the database look complete.   Hei guys, one good news, my immediate boss is out of town, for two weeks and i will be free till Aug 22. Not exactly free, but wont have much pressure though he has given me my schedule. You know guys, i am supposed to be in Hyderabad for a training in my working domain - Railway signal Engineering @ IRSET. But then since i had to go for a trip with Srini and his friends on 15,16,17, i have decided to forego. Even my division head is not ready to send me as i am the only female candidate. So he has promised to send me next year when i would have got more acquaintances and knowledge update too.  And jax, y no blogs from u for the past two days? What happened? Layout pottu pottu onju poittiya, illa color combination paathu paathu theynju poitiya?   And regarding the solution to autorickshaw problem, i havent yet given a second thought, so will update on it later till then bye
