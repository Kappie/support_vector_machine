This last chapter has been quite a tough one to complete.  My deadline was Monday. As of Sunday, I was still only half way through writing the damn thing, so I made the ultimate decision... I was going to stay up until it was done. I spent all day Sunday, all night Sunday night, all the way until Monday morning writing. And it was good. And all was well with the world. I was going to be done shortly -- I had about two hours of work left to go.  And then, the power went out.  No panic from me of course. I was more worried about "how long is this going to take" than anything. I actually took a little nap waiting for it to come back on.  It turns out, I should have been more worried. I lost about three hours work. But wait, you say. Didn't you have "AutoRecover" turned on in Word? Well, yes, I reply. I had it set to AutoSave every 4 minutes. The most I SHOULD have lost was 4 minutes. But I lost three hours. I could not convince MS Word to open the AutoRecover backup any way I tried. And I tried every way there was. Word would actually HANG each time it tried to open the file. So my backup must have been corrupt.  Well, moral of the story... even with AutoRecover. Save often. Ctrl-S is your friend. And as of midnight tonight, I'm still not done writing. I gave up trying to recover the file after a couple of hours, decided to head to work where I was AWOL today, went to dinner, had a long nap, and I'm just getting back into the grove now.
