It's not the words that shocks me but the way she said it.  She sounds exhausted and desperate (of getting out).  If there's anything I have learned from the past 2 years of working life - it's that "People do change".  Little by little, piece by piece, many old friends of mine changed a lot after they start working.  Me too, although I have considered myself pretty resistent to change.  But even I can notice that I have sorta lost the passion I used to have, the fulfilling sense of completion is gradually fading away as well.  Believe or not, I used to be happy just because I learned how to rap a song; finished a boss from videogame; getting a new comic book.....  Doing those things nowadays... still excites me, but not as much... anymore.  Speaking of which, no wonder i'm getting a lot of "I'm so bored!!!!!" from my friends these days.  And I'm kinda scared... what will happen when the feeling has totally fade away?  Would I become a dull adult like those people I see everyday on bus, MRT and train?  Is it inevitable?
