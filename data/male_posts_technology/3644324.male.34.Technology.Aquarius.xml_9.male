I think my physiotherapist is just milking this gravy train but he says that my ability to climb the stairs without crying doesn't mean I'm sufficiently healed to play this week. Hopefully another week will see me back in the fold and proudly wearing the manly lavender blouses of SWARM: The only team in Thursday Div. 1 with an unblemished record.       In other news, after last week's debacle I drove out to Abbotsfordand found afarm where they had some, as yet, un-euthenized chickens. I purchased some non-dead (not undead) poultry and visited mycousin's Haitian friend's aunt's mambo and after a fairly confusing ceremony involving the chicken (sadly now deceased) several ceiling fans and a brief appearance by Lisa Bonet the crapulent cloud seems to have dispersed.      Oddly, before I got home and managed to wash off the entrails and white mudmy mindwas briefly overtaken by the spirit of an eighteenth century Japanese girl who apparently had some unfinished haiku's she wanted to share. We came to an agreement where she agreed to desist in her unininvitedinhabitation of the corporeal realm and I agreed to write more haiku's.         Lavender clad bugs   With cleated feat and short pants -    Stay upwind of Swarm       The disk thrown with skill   To bugs swarming in the sun -   Victory is near.      Weekly combatents-   On nights both wet and sultry   The VUL must go on      Disk bouncing off chest -    The agony of the miss   When rain clouds your eye      When a good "D" means   You're too lazy to say drink -    You belong with Swarm
