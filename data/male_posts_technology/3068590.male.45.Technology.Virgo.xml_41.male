The ability to move from the consumer to the investment environment would create winners and losers and these would lead to significant opportunity or destruction of value.   This destruction, in my opinion, has commenced with the markets slow and insidious decline in value. There will be no overnight reconciliation, only death by a billion pin pricks over a number of years. Only when the average consumer can perceive the losses that have occurred in this environment, will the death be realized.  The value declines will come in a number of methods that were assumed to be the basic fundamental components of western living or lifestyles. They include personal values, securities, and pensions.   The home values and personal possessions are the premier concern of the Western consumer. These are attributed far greater value then they currently can and will realize, therefore the value associated to these has already diminished. The value of homes will be reconciled during these coming years and exacerbate the capital deflation in the western world.   Securities are scary. Particularly mutual funds. When money is managed through the explicit renunciation of accountability, problems occur. Consistently the accountability deficiencies provides greater opportunities to mitigate the accounting for these deficiencies. As time passes the deficiencies only become epidemic and are manifest in the "owners" losses.   Bonds and stocks are provided much of the liquidity and support through the consumers and not through the investment in capital goods. Therefore the decline in those will occur in this time frame as well. If the value of the U.S. dollar declines, then these problems will become difficult for many to overcome.   Pensions are a direct result of the health and viability of the marketplace and the companies that employ the majority of the employees. Here I ask if the large organization, with its inherent hierarchy and associated bureaucracy can survive the natural force of self forming teams. Based on my direct research in this area, the answer is an unequivocal no.  Death by a billion pin pricks provides real opportunities to those that are able to use this decline. The only requirement is the capacity to use the tools afforded all in the technologies, the very advanced education of each individual, and investments in capital goods. The analogy I would use would be to ensure that you have a producing asset stuffed in the mattress.
