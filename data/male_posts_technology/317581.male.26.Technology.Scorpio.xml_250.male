Gotta call the parentals today and see about $$:(  Trav: tru dat, tru dat, I don't know why the older ladies like you, maybe they've realized how a good guy could be, and they got stuck with jerks? :) just a thought.  also, I just got this link from JEBE about  urlLink free mammograms  and you should all click on this. You know I'm always in favor of saving breasts... umm... women.
