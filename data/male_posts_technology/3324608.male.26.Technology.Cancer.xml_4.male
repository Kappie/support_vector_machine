I never thought I would be married, but you meet the right. . . er, most amazing  beautiful person in the whole world (and they're cute!) . . . what are ya supposed to do?  Married life is great.  This last year has been so crazy and busy with school, work, being married (oh, and cats!), but it has most definately been the best year of my life.  I feel very lucky and blessed to be able to spend the rest of my life with my best friend and soulmate!  That's probably enough sappy stuff for now . . .
