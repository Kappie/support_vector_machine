A wall have been built near the Holy of Holies and this shows that the end times is coming. But even that gives us the urgencies to even pray more and to share out God's love in this times.  Passion is one of the greatest movie to be filmed and shown with Passion is gonna be screened in Malaysia thanks to the DAP from Seputeh who fights for the right of Christians to see the movie. Don't know how the censorship is gonna censor it but I pray that the movie will not be censored to retain its full purpose in showing how our Savior died for us..How much love He have poured out to see that the sins of men are washed clean so that we can give our greatest adoration. How He longs to see us worship Him...with a clear conscious heart and a sweet spirit.  I pray that we would now even respond to God's love by even preparing your okios for the movie. So let's respond yea ...for the coming of Christ.  Let's pray for the Malays of Malaysia able to sneak a peek at what is in store for them in the Passion..to realize there is a true living God who defied death and truly lives . A God that loves them for He have created them with tender loving care and details.  Bapa di Syurga, kami ingin menyayangi Bapa dengan sepenuh hati kita, dengan minda kita , dengan sepenuh jiwa kita. kami ingin lihat kawan kita, saudara kita, keluarga kita datang ke dalam dakapan Tuhan. Anda Bapa ,betapa sayangnya and kasih kepada kita sehingga kamu menyerahkan anak KesayanganMu supaya dosa dosa kami dapat dilupuskan.   Dengan itu, kami ingin serahkan segala hidup kami dalam tanganMu supaya NamaMu dimuliakan untuk selama lamanya. Kami sembahMu kerana kami cinta Mu Yesus.  Dalam nama Yesus Kami Berdoa Amin
