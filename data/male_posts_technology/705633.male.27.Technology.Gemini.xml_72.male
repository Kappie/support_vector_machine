I've been working my ass off this week on an e-commerce project at work, and we went out for a curry last night as most of the work is done now. I had a wicked strength Chicken Jalfrazi then met up with Custard in the Sports Bar, then to Follies, and lastly GAP. I was chatting to Custard and a tall brunette (who bared a striking resemblance to Harry Potter) pulled me onto the dance floor and started dancing with me. After about 10 minutes she drags me over to the side of the club, next to this big body builder type. Then she says.. "Listen.. I’m married. You're a really nice guy and my husband and I would like to buy you a drink." She motions to the gorilla standing next to me, who looks me up and down and gives me an approving wink. I make a break for it and clear the dance floor in three strides, grabbing my coat and drinking buddy en route.
