I'm delighted by your posts, but I have NO idea who you are. :)   How did you manage to stumble into this delightful gathering of the slightly maladjusted? :)  Thanks for the encouraging words.  I do occasionally feel guilty about my illnesses.  Not so much toward the insurance company, but for those around me who have to deal with it...since, well...I get sick a lot.  I'm just one of those lucky people.  I guess I couldn't be this beautiful and talented and charming without having SOMETHING wrong with me.   But yeah...Cigna can bite my ass.  I'm milking them for every penny I can. :)  Tree -  I have a friend about to enter design school...she'd like to do what you do for a living.  If you don't want to take up blogger space with it, could you email me and give me some info/advice about it to pass along to her?  It'd mean a lot...thanks!
