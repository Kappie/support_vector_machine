While I can't honestly say I found it  better  than the first, it was certainly as good as it, and one of the best sequels I've seen to date.  From a techie perspective, it's some of the best CG animation I've seen since  Finding Nemo .  I'd go so far as to say it even surpassed Nemo in some respects (i.e. how water interacts with objects). If you're into the techie aspects of CG animation, I  strongly  recommend you go see this movie. I highly doubt you'll come away disappointed.
