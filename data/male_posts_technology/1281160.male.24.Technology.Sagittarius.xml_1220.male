And there are hopes afloat.. on what Mr.PC would unveil to the billon people of the country... surprisingly, he would also be more worried about pleasing a few tens of people rather than this billion.. the few tens I'm referring to are the noble-hearted, people-minded, kind, generous, compassionate lot called the communists...   How far would it be a dream budget in the lines of what Mr.PC presented in 1997.. his only other budget... that won him laurels across the salaried and waged class alike... VDIS was touted to be one of the revolutions he envisaged.. so much as the concept of competition postcards.. This time however, Mr.PC is facing a brand new India... economies are at an unseen height... Forex is plumpy at $119bn.. all he needs to do is to continue the good work that has been happening in the country... Hope Mr.PC springs up another one just like the good ol' fella that he is...
