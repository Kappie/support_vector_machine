Now it woz a gud film although i beleive it could of been considerably cut down in length cause there were many parts you didnt need to see. Also the cinema didnt put a break in like they said a little while ago on there site! I was quite annoyed with that cause i didnt wanna miss ne of the film by going to the toilet! So i waited till it had finshed then rushed to the toilet, ask Andy Scott and DAvid i woz in there for a while! But over all a good film, i would advise you to go see it, but only if you seen the first two films otherwise you would get a bit lost in the plot! So wot are peeps Crimbo plans? Ne one going ne where specail? Tmor im working in the morning then going to my cousins for crimbo dinner, then sunday im working. On crimbo day i think my grandparents are coming over so that should be fun! Other than wokring thats about all im doing!
