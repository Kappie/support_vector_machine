Wow, she was super cute, long blonde wavy hair, she was wearing those nice tight low waist "dirty jeans" with a white belt and white shoes.  She had a sleeveless top on but it was more of a tight fitting t-shirt.  She was wearing a khaki form fitting jacket and a teal and white trucker hat.  She had a rock solid body and one of the cutest warmest faces and smiles I have ever seen.  She was a god send.  Besides being that attractive, yes I have quirky high standards, she was an amazing dancer.  He friend was also good and wasn't bad looking.  Her friend had long black hair, wearing similar jeans and white indoor soccer shoes, white belt and a black sleeveless formfitting top.  They were probably the best girl dancers there.  Sure there are those stripper dancer girls that were there too but they just do one thing.  These two had skill and they polish it on a regular basis.  Tight moves and they hit the beat like a pro.  I was admiring their footwork since it was excellent.  I need to improve my foot work.  It's not bad but it's not as good as these girls.  Yes, a new crush.  I wish I didn't have to work so damn early everyday and stay so late.  I would have gotten their names at least.  SHIT, I was on stage with those two girls busting moves, shaking off the rust for a good 20-30 mins.  I am so sore today from trying to keep up with those girls.  No other guy wanted a peice of that action up there.  It was just me and the girls for a while there.  FUCK FUCK FUCK.  why didn't I even get their damn names at least?  I'm retarded.  I did get a number though.  Filipina girl named Joy.  She's from the south side of Chicago and from Cebu.  I don't know if I will call her.  She's not completely my type.  Sure she was short and asian but that was about it.  Cute to an extent eh, I am being to critical.  I will probably call her to invite her to the bar for my party and to bring a bunch of her friends.  Yes, after not going out and not dancing for a good month now, I am fucking sore.  Oh and I left my damn XBOX on all last night.  I didn't realize I just fucking passed out and woke up this morning to a few fucking invites.  I just turned that shit off and ate my breakfast and went to work.  Not really hungover, just tired and sore.    Anyways, have a good day.  It's probably going to be a boring day.  I still need to buy the big game here.  I gotta pick out numbers and shit
