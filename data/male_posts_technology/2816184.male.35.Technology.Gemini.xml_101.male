Hax appears in the door, with Missy behind him.  "Hmmmm, not too much power generation going on here is there?"  A metal walkway is suspended about 25 feet above the floor.  A stairway at the wall leads up to it.  In the back of the room, you can see on the upper floor a sort of control room type thingy overlooking teh main floor.  Under that are doors that appear to go into some other part of the building.
