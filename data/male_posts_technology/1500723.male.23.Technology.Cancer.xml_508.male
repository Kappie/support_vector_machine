Writers and painters know that good work is the result of an enormous amount of reworking or rewriting and are taught to be patient with the process of figuring out what they are trying to create. But programmers, Graham writes, are taught that they should "figure out a program completely on paper before even going near a computer."  "I found that I did not program this way.... Instead of patiently writing out a complete program and assuring myself it was correct, I tended to just spew out code that was hopelessly broken, and gradually beat it into shape. Debugging, I was taught, was a kind of final pass where you caught typos and oversights. The way I worked, it seemed like programming consisted of debugging."  :-) Brand new addition to the hit-list:  urlLink Hackers and Painters   and btw, I picked this up from the Random Wired search on the side-bar :-) I rock!
