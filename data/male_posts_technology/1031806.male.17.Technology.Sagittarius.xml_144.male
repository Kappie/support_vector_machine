You know, I was secretly afraid this was going to happen the entire time, but I guess I pretty well convinced myself that it wasn't, because if I'd thought about it for long enough, I would have been insanely depressed... and now that it actually has happened... exactly as I feared it would but never thought it would, I think I can handle it.  Well, maybe...  Hmm...  Only time will tell...   What on earth am I talking about you ask? Well, in the course of our conversation tonight (this morning - lol) Gwen told me that she had something that she wanted to talk to me about (Im thinking *oh no, here it comes*). She said she had been doing a lot of thinking about it over the three weeks she was away, and had decided that it would probably be better if we just remained friends... never to become anything greater. She went on to say that (*yup, I guessed it alright*) she had found someone that she was more interested in while on the trip. (Story of my life.) Immediately afterward though, she added that she wanted to continue being friends, and I heartily agreed.  After that our normal conversation resumed and we talked for another 45 minutes until her mom made us (well, me since she knows I have work early in the morning, and Gwen doesn't) get off.  o.O I just remembered that email I sent, that I know for certain she hasn't read yet... Hmmm... I wonder what effect that'll have...  Well, good night and happy landings and don't forget to check out the newest of my friend's blogs...  urlLink Andrew's
