What's more insulting to the poorstarvingartist than wastefulness? (Answer: not much.) (And I apologise for not giving it a fair shake, but read on...)   I have to agree with your wry observation about successes making failures of art. I am certainly less inclined to see a movie that's gone mainstream, and yes, it is reverse snobbism. That's one of the unfortunate things that I got with my BFA: the belief that artisanally-produced projects appeal to connoisseurs, not the masses. I admit it's skewed (but tell me: How many pieces of furniture have been purchased in Richmond from Ethan Allen or Haynes or (godforbid) Target rather than at Harrison Higgins, who custom-makes beautiful solid goods right on Broad Street at Lombardy?). It's oversimplified  illogical to infer that I won't like a film because it's popularly acclaimed, yet I do it anyway, because experience has taught me that my taste isn't right in step with that of the general viewing public. Yes, I miss things. Yes, I regret the oversights when I discover  correct them. But I'm a stubborn, reactionary little human, and it's the method, although flawed, that's served me best so far.  I know: Judge not lest ye be judged....
