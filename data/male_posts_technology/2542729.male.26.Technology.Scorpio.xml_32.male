Its all good tho, just gotta keep movin', that's the key. Just gotta keep movin' brother. Naah, I haven't seen my peoples in quite some time...haven't really heard from them much either. Poverty has a way of touching across miles, ya know? Yea I used to be poor...but never on that welfare stuff tho', naah not me. We had a little more pride than that when I was growin' up. But we weren't against handouts tho. Naah, you never turn down free stuff ya know? Didn't have much of a choice half the time...father wasn't there, granted he did die. Left my mom all by her lonesome, yup. He's prolly turnin' over in his grave, realizing that i'm headed off the Iraq tho. Man was afraid to die, much less for his country. Hey that's the irony of life you know? The very thing you try to avoid is what gets you. Well lemme tell you what's been goin' down these past few weeks. Before I get started, I would like to send a personal shoutout to my one  only sweetheart, ladies  gentlemen, a round of applause for LADYBIRD aka Mell Tripple Cosey (Stevenson :-) )!!!! Tripple Cosey ladies  gentlemen!! (Take a bow baby!!!!)  These past few weeks we've been training, as you all know. Some of this training has been really interesting, culminating with the town raid we did a few days ago. Before that, we've been training up to that event...doing a myriad of different training stuffs, taking a bunch of friggin classes...having my behind dozing off hard. But nothing in life has ever moved me the way yesterdays' events moved me.... Yesterday I saw The Passion of the Christ. That movie is the single greatest..... wow.  ...I don't look at it like a movie... I see...a man who willingly came to earth to be the propitiation for the sins of all mankind...I spent the majority of the second half of that movie in pure tears, sobbing like nothing I had ever....EVER felt before. Feeling more worthless in my so-called pursuit of true Godliness. Still feeling worthless...undeserving... God put this beautiful, incredibly talented woman in my life...blessed me wiht a sound mind and a decent heart...blessed me with strength in my limbs...blessed me with another day, which means, another chance. What have I done to deserve any of this??? I'm just a guy, in a world that hates me, one which...hated him first, and even moreso than me...  Mankind in itself is not deserving, if you ask me. Corrupt from the beginning, abhoring from his delegated purpose. I hate to be so negative but that's what a blog is for. It can't always be pretty.   Thank you God for sending your son Jesus, who was sent to earth to die so that we unworthy parishioners might live. We realize that it is through you that all our blessings come into fruition, so we praise you in the firmament of Holiness, praise you from the rooftops, praise your name across the mountains because we know that all of our help comes from you! THANK YOU JESUS FOR SAVING US FROM SIN!!!  Your brother, Ron J.
