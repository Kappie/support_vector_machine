I'm a sucker for foreign accents.. my favorite is british!! hehe. it's remarkably head-spinning! it's like a drug.. but i don't do drugs!! haha.. and i'm speakin' while i'm writing this! haha.. u can just go right ahead and imagine me doing it.. :) i'm insane! i know.. i've said that several times already in my whole life.. (still speaking in a british accent.. haha!)  who did i vote? well, it's supposed to be a secret but it doesn't matter now.. this would be a shock to some of you guys, but i didn't vote Eddie Villanueva.. If Eddie Gil was still on the list, I would vote him!! NOT!!! haha.. We have a reason why we didn't vote him and I don't want to stress it out.. :) we all can vote whoever we want and that's totally okay.. it's a freedom! (",) But if you insist on asking my reasons of not voting Mr Villanueva, well then I think I would tell you about it, i think? hehe.. anyway, i voted GMA! why so? let's say i voted for Ping Lacson.. would that do me any good? I don't think so, coz' as you can see, he's soooooooooo far away from winning.. and if i voted him, gma would lose 1 vote and that's a plus 1 for FPJ.. and the outcome? it could be a disaster! hehe.. what if my vote was the last one that could keep FPJ from winning? now that's not a pretty sight! you get my point right? I would help out GMA just to keep FPJ from winning.. but that's not all the reason why I voted her, of course! hehe.. we can't hide the fact that she's intelligent, right? she went to hardvard with clinton for crying out loud! hehe.. some may say that she's corrupt, but who isn't? if some may say that they aren't and will not compromise, hmmmm.. i think that's totally impossible! coz' some already did some compromising, as seen on tv.. don't ask me about it okay? hehe.. if you know what i'm talkin' about, then keep it to yourself so that we can avoid arguements.. :) hehe.. about choosing a candidate that i think would win, well that wasn't on my mind at all.. my head was all focused on qualification and experience..  enough about credentials and stuff about qualification or calling or whatever! the voting had already been done for.. let's just support whoever sits on which seat.. :) we won't achieve any economic development if we don't unite and cooperate.. (",) let's just pray for a peaceful election culmination..  viva EDDIE GIL!!!! haha.. (",) I'm a retard!!!
