Houston seems nice, from the little i've seen of it - just about as humid as they come - and that from someone that's lived all their life in Atlanta  Nashville.  training so far ... lessee ... interesting, but old-hat stuff so far for me.  it's been nice getting the fleshed out "official" explanation/presentation, and it's afforded me the opportunity to find out some particulars and details i wouldn't have otherwise known, but thus far, there have been no major revelations.  BUT, i suppose that would be a credit to how well Mike trained me.  ;)  if all goes according to plan, i'll be able to meet up with a highschool buddy of mine for dinner sometime this week - for now, i'll hope for some of my fellow trainees being hungry after class - and if not... off on my own, i guess.  ;)
