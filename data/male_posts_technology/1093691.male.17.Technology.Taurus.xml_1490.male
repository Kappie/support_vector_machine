So far I have been doing nothing over the holidays since Sunday, when I came back from my Aunts. One thing to look forward to: Bad Lads Army tonight! Best thing ITV have had on all year.   On another positive note, I managed to grab a high score of 27 kills to 11 deaths on CounterStrike, coming in first place - and far ahead of the second to top who had a score of 19 kills to 15 deaths. I'm sure you are all very, very interested in that.   Now i'm off to have lunch and to chase up Apple. They need to replace my eMac monitor due to two mini electron guns going tits up.
