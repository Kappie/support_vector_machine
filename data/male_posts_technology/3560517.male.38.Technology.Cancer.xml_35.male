Bush leads in Independants by 3 points and leads in Republicans, by a greater margin than Kerry leads in Democrats.  The country is approx 40% Rep/Dem and 20% Independant.  If that was the case in the poll, Bush would be ahead as shown below.  Sorry for the allignment problems...you can't paste charts into these boxes.    If poll used make up of the country Bush would lead 50% to 46%:  	     Dem	 Ind	     Rep		 	40.00%	20.00%	40.00%	Totals	 Total	468	234	468	1,169	100.00% Bush	37	115	430	582	49.80% Kerry	416	108	14	538	46.00%   Actual poll results:  	All	Dem	Ind	Rep Bush	44.0%	8.0%	49.0%	92.0% Kerry	51.0%	89.0%	46.0%	3.0%    To get the numbers they came up with:  	Dem	Ind	Rep		 	48.75%	15.50%	35.75%	Totals	 Total	570	181	418	1,169	100.00% Bush	46	89	384	519	44.39% Kerry	507	83	13	603	51.59%   To get their percentages for Bush and Kerry, using the pattern of how each group voted, they would have to have almost 49% Dems, 15.5% Ind and only 36% Reps.  So, they grossly over represented the Dems in the poll.  Its no wonder that their poll showed Kerry out front !!!
