It was 3am and I didn't care she was hungry and I gladly would get out of bed to take care of her as she was always there for me she had never left me least... not yet. I shook my head to clear my image and reached again. I never went back to bed my favorite past time that early in the morning was to look at all the inventions that were playing on the T.V. Knifes to cut food, that would be nice if I had food to cut, ladders that had a hundred and one uses, I would loved to by one just to play with it but the ceilings in my apt were a little less then 6 feet, but I still was amazing by how much great stuff there was. Who needed "Leave it to Beaver" reruns when you had Ronco himself showing you how to "set it, and forget it." As I lazily walked along my foot failed to rasie high enough a uneven crack in the pavment and I was jolted from my fanasty and back to my question. I remembered walking into work and as I pasted the breakroom someone had said good morning and I flung my hand back and waved but I did not say anything. All day I loaded the trucks, one would pull in hand me his papers which I would sign then point to a small stool where I took my lunches and loaded the nessary pallets into the dark holes these men drove around while they talked about this or that. Women they picked up or how many days they could go without sleep, then never showered always smelled of cheap weed and liqure.I neverminded much though it was like the news to me they as I could tell went out into a world and were wise to the road that and making hikers paying for there rides. Didn't matter much to them if they were Men, Women, girls or boys.. they all paid the same in the end. So what do you say to that? I personally smile and nod, like you know what they are taking about, you could make them think you understood and weren't judging them. Yes sir, I am a sick fuck just like you mister and with a pat on the back they were gone but no I can't say I talked to anyone today at work. I felt my mouth at that moment and found my lips didn't part to easy, they were dry and chapped, I could feel them crack apart and knew I tasted a hint of blood on my lips I knew then that if I had spoken today my lips sure didn't remember it they would hopefully forgive me as I would use the last of my vasoline on them tonight which ment that I would be chafing the little man downstairs raw. Good thing it was Friday because the last time this happened I wasn't able to walk for a couple days after wacking off dry. Yes sir... this was going to be a beautiful Forth of July.
