The comedy routine continues with the Ralph in question, Schumacher, states that the Toyota team are in discussions with him for the next year.   Reading my prior blog, you'll notice that Ralph does not deserve a civilian license let alone a Williams.   It now appears that Ralph is out of the Williams for next year as their does not seem to be any major announcement of his signing.   Toyota would pay for the Schumacher name and that is Ralph's best interest. Williams have no signed drivers for 2004, and yet don't seem to be the least bit concerned about it.   As we start the 2004 season we can clearly see the pretenders and the contenders, and really only the current stable of champions of Jacque and Mika Hakkinen, but not Michael Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya and Kimi Raikonen are capable of securing a championship. Mclaren have their drivers, Ferarri have theirs and Williams is sitting back and cherry picking the real talent.   Lets hear it for Sir Frank for continuing to be the smartest guy on the grid.
