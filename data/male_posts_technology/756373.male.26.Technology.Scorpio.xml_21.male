In keeping with todays blog(lower down), I propose that society can be split up into 5 groups. 1)Those who cannot 'see the line', but stick to the side of good, right and sanity. This is ye average working class pleb. 2)Those who cannot 'see the line', and remain on the side of wrong, evil and insanity. Violent criminals, gangbangers and the like. 3)Those who see the line, and stick to the side of good, right and sanity. I guess these'd be like the true blue cops, those who are in it for the love, not the money. I've always wanted to be a cop, or a fireman, or a doctor. Perhaps it's because I can see what's on the other side of the line and want to get as far away from it as possible. Perhaps because the further away I can get, the less alluring it would be... 4)Those who see the line yet stray over to the 'dark' side. Psychopaths, serial killers, loonies, basketcases etc.  5)Lastly, you get the occasional few who see the line and like walking down it, like a trapeze artist on a tightrope. I've known a few people like this. Scary stuff, they never quite plunge all the way into insanity, but they're never truly completely sane either. Some psychologists/analysts/etc would argue that psychopaths do not know that what they are doing is wrong. I would disagree. They know. It's just that they  enjoy it , nonetheless.
