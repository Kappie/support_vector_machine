Since I don't have to mess about with multiple devices, I'm using it a lot more and capturing some of those random thoughts that hit me, go away, hit me again, and so on.  Even better, I got the Pocket Tunes application for it, plus a 256Mb SD card.  Just this very moment, a double album by Paul Oakenfold that's one of my favorites is copying in WMA format directly from Windows Media Player onto the Treo.  I have headphones and the adapter I mentioned in a previous post about shopping at Radio Shack, so I can listen to music directly off my phone any time.  I think about what life was like before cell phones, and PDAs, and all this cool technology, and I wonder how we did it.  I actually know how: we didn't know any better.  I wonder what we don't know any better about now that will be cool and critical in ten years?  You know, when I'm getting my first immortality treatments?
