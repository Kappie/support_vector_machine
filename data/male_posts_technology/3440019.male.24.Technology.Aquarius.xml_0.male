Everyday there will be calls from some bank or the other making an offer for a car loan.    But their is one question. How do we categorise driving/riding? Is it a pleasure or a pain? Most of us would agree it is more of pain than pleasure. The reason cannot be attributed to the bad roads alone, which many say are nothing but connected potholes, but to the attitude of the drivers.     I do not deny the fact that the condition of roads are very bad and causes a lot of traffic jams. But there are good roads too where traffic jams and slow moving traffic take place. The reason is us drivers. How many of us actually follow all the rules laid down by the traffic police? How many of us honk unnecessaily while waiting for the red light to change or in a slow moving traffic knowing very well that they cannot go any faster?    This is not done by only the uneducated people but by the so called 'educated' people, the graduates, post-graduates. There are instances where the signal is red, the traffic police is not present and we break the rule. We drive rash and create problems for the other drivers. The reason is we get the 'Kick' out of this. On top of this is the drunk driving. People are least bothered if the drunk drivers die in an accident as they deserve it but what about the people who are the victimes of these drunken monks.    The latest is teenagers driving without licence. What are the parents of these children think they are doing? They are playing with both the lives of their children and the others. Have they no conscience or moral that they are breaking the law they have accepted to abide by.    People sometimes drive as if they are in a race even in residential areas where they very well know that they have to curtail their speeds to the maximum.   When rains come God save the pedestrains from the splashes we drivers create while wading through the rain waters. Can't we be considerate. Are we such barbarians?    This is utterly insane. Don't we have the slightest responsibility to uphold the law. On top of this we always say that the police harrass the people. I don't say this never happens but if we abide by the law the police will most probably not harrass us. If we are caught the first thing we do is negotiate a bribe with the police. When we do that we don't think that the polce has lost all respect for us. When I was caught for a wrong turn I paid the fine in whole and apologised and the inspector was also very kind and apologised for the trouble they supposedly to have caused. I think everyone has the duty to uphold the law and should not blame the police alone. Only then can we make driving a pleasure.    Thanks once more for your patience and please comment on will. Thanks.
