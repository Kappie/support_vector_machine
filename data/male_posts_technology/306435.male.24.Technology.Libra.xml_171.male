No, it was not helping me recognize that I am addicted to caffeine, but raising the prices of a bottle to $1.10!  Can you believe that?  I can't.  I won't pay a over a dollar for a soda waiting in line for a roller coaster, let alone at my work.  For a dollar ten I expect a fancy three-dimensional hologram cup, a frosted glass bottle, or a scoop of ice cream!
