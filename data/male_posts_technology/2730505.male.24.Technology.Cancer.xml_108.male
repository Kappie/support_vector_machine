I'm not really too keen on Voodoo since the last time I was there, it was all ghetto and shit.  I hope that the place won't attract the ghettoness tonight but then again it might be worse.  Tomorrow (Saturday) is my company's open house for customers and the public.  They have a few presentations and such and tours.  Good thing I won't be here.  I'm not really involved in sales nor the advertising/marketing side of things so there's no reason for me to be here.  In the afternoon I am helping one of the mechanics here at my company with their computer problems.  I'm sure I will just reformat the reinstall everything.  I'm probably going to download any service patches that need to be installed as well as programs/games.  That shouldn't take long.  After that, relax for a bit at home and then get ready for North Beach on Saturday.  I heard that it's better than the Thursdays there so it's definitely worth checking out.  Sunday is free.  It's free all damn day.  I really don't know what to do on Sunday.  Maybe I'll do laundry then.  I kinda don't want to do anything right now.  Yeah, those are my plans for the weekend.  I hope you have a good time at the party.
