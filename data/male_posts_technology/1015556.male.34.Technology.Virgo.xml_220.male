I was, if you didn't know, being facetious.  There is not a ghetto in Howard County.  Some interesting figures from the census: Median household money income, 1999 - $74,167	 Persons below poverty, percent, 1999 - 3.9%  Plugging in$74K into  urlLink globalrichlist  , I got this:  You are in the top 0.755% richest people in the world. There are 5,954,658,435 people poorer than you. One hour's salary = approx $51.38 Oh, and in case you’re interested you are the 45,341,565 richest person in the world.  Please don't say 'ghetto' anymore.
