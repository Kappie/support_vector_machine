I have alos found one for £355 which is quite cheap for a trampoline, but all i get is No your not having one, No you dont need one and NO YOUR NOT HAVING ONE ! But the thing is i really want one and i know for a fact i would use it alot to practise on :( It is getting me really annoyed and frustrated and my birthday isnt until July ! lol. Anyway today was quite boring and i think i have really hurt my elbow cause when eva i hold something with that arm the elbow really hurts and is very painfull. But maybe im just a wimp ! And about the prom, its AGES away, why is everybody worring about it now? Im fed up of people going on aboutn it and who is going with who, we havent even been told where it is yet we have only heard rumours and stuff, we havent been told by the head of year or anything ! Knowing our luck it wont be where we thin kit is and it wont happen !lol bye
