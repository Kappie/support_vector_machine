One of the dams had a huge crane called 'goliath' that was on rails the length of the dam, giving it the ability to completely lift a gate for repairs etc.. quite impressive to round a windy corner and be confronted with this monolith of creation.. a big spider of girders and bolts, quite a feat of engineering. Caused me to think a bit about NZ, and iraq and the inevitible running out of resources... not a lot of NZ realise that a good chunk of our electricity comes from renewable resources, mainly geothermal and hydroelectric - this puts us in good stead when you consider that the USA has a little over a days use of petrol/coal in its own reserves, and relies so much on external sources that -will- dry up... unless they keep declaring war and claiming oil reserves - but thats a different rant alltogether. We should marvel in the good decisions our predecessors made to invest in Hydro. We rock. and we'll be enjoying microwave meals long after america has hit apocolyptic energy crisis - hoorah! but then, its america - so who cares! right? Beautiful evening settling in upon us, and the extremely 'small town' takeaways we had in te teko for lunch didnt quite hit the spot, so I'm going to cut some nice big slabs of corned beef, batter them, and call it dinner. Allblacks versus Argentina tonight, watch the scrumming and backline passing. Might post again before bed. Ka Kite Ano, ake ake aue.
