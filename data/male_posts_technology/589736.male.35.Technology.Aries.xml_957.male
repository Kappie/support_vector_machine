I'm going to really make myself look young here and just say that song is one of the anthems of my generation.  I rocked out to it to the point of nearly losing my voice on the way home from work today.  It kicks that much ass.  You know what else owns?  A good tuna melt.    I wish I could be happy today not feeling so guilty about how badly we're getting our asses beat right now.
