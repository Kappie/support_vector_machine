Was down with fever yesterday and couldn’t come into work. 88pro believes I was trying to be the " urlLink energizer bunny " and hence the fever. But I can assure that I was at my best behavior....but perhaps not at my best senses when having that cold shower at 10:00 pm after a jog...  I was also reminded that, it’s not only tiny organisms that can make ones temperature go up a few notches. This monstrous act can also be performed by other beings which although look every bit human as we do are actually aliens beamed down to earth to take over our green planet (killing humans by giving them a heart attack or high blood pressure or just plain old suicide). Of course you know by now that I have discovered one of them here in our team (but this is just our secret...ok??).   This alien (prick) being has to go and spoil my already rotten day by telling me that "when you come to work tomorrow you can do this.....you know when was in organization b they would cut my daily allowance in half if I didn’t report to work........Then I think I should have stayed away when I was ill". Did I not know of the new king for this region??!! Must check the latest news (CNN.com is it??).  What pisses me off is this dufus has no say in what I do. So why in the world does he have to give his two scents worth when I won't even take it for free.  Of course you may say I am getting peeved over a minor incident........on contraire`....this is one of several such weird encounters!!  I was telling 88pro later that evening that I need to finish his book "Handling  urlLink difficult conversations  (in this case also known as 'how to talk to aliens')". Maybe I'll have to carry it around with me and refer it every time I have a conversation with this EEEEVIL being.....    Ok....back to anger management and the book now...........
