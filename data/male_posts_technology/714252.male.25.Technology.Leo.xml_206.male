The end result of which was I have decided that one of my testicles is larger than the other (or one of my hands is larger than the other) and that you can feel your testicles moving on their own if you pay attention to it.. (For any Gurls reading this, a guys testicles slowly move all on their own when left to their own devices.. It can be fun to just sit and watch the little fellas doing their little dance all on their own) Actually that was quite funny..  Mike:"I wonder if you can feel your testicles moving on their own without touching them"  Bubbles:"I Dunno"  Mike and Bubbs in Unison: "Yep, you can"  Queue the Smile and Girlish Titter.  We also had quite a discussion on dressing to the left\right and the situations that can occur "When cocks go hard" (Tonight on Sky One as part of Tuesday nights reality night) There is nothing weirder than sitting down in Salsa and someone comes to ask and as you go to stand up you realize the old tackle has decided it's time to make an example of you again and what’s worst is it somehow managed to trap itself down your left trouser leg.. I don't know if girls have ever noticed but when the ole' buy gets stuck in a position like that it's EXTREMELY obvious that something is fighting to make it back to the nice safe confines of being "dressed to the right"  Which reminds me, I have officially named Tuesday as random hard on day.. We were also discussing the "random erection". When you turn around and for no apparent reason your second favourite shower companion has decided to go into action without you..  Bubbles: You know the way you get an errection for no apparent reason, it's just there.  Mike: Yeah, Like on a Tuesday  So henceforth Tuesday is boner day :)  Wow.. Now that I think of it, we were like a couple of school girls at a slumber party. Sick
