Nice to be back in the Big Apple, though.  Congrats on the onstage murder, AA. Nice to see postings from JLS. Glad you got wheels, MM. And kudos for the promotion. How's the little woman  her cargo, Silentw? Bach, I like the posting format status quo. Thanks for asking. And I don't ever use the links  have none to add.  Wish that I could make it to the Porkfest. Eat for me. Overeat, in fact.  Will be in town September 7 through 9 or 10. Perhaps we could all (or mostly) meet up? Have a wedding to attend evening of 7th....
