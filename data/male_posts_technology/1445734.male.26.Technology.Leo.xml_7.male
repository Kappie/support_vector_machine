An online anti-outsourcing website is marketing a T-shirt with the legend "Don't Get Bangalored," a term suggesting losing one's job to outsourcing. The T-shirts, in two separate designs, are priced at $ 15.99. The word has already found a place in online discussions. "I am a software developer who is about to be 'bangalored.' Fine. I am not going to pout about it," a participant in the forum Technewsworld wrote this week. "The media writes that we are in a global economy so deal with it. Okay, I will." If the word sticks around, then it will quite likely make the annual addition to various dictionaries. Although there have been other geographical places that have been turned into words (called toponyms; eg Frankfurter, Marathon, Balkanization, Finlandized, Detroit), few cities have taken a verb form.  Bangalore itself is already associated with a torpedo which was devised by a British army captain in 1912. Bangalore Torpedos were used to clear barbed wire entanglements in World War II, especially in the D-Day landings, and are in use even today. But Americans are being ribbed even while trying make a few bucks of the outsourcing controversy. On a separate forum, an Indian named "Harish" joked that $ 15.99 was too high a price for a T-shirt and suggested the manufactured be outsourced.   A separate website of American info-tech professionals sells an even pricier T-shirt ($ 19.99) that reads "My Job Went To India And All I Got Was A Stupid T-Shirt."  The T-shirt flap aside, Bangalore has certainly entered the American lexicon.  Democratic Presidential candidate John Kerry recently suggested at a meeting that he wanted American cities to be wired like Bangalore, perhaps not realizing that for all its vaunted reputation, the city has dismal connectivity.
