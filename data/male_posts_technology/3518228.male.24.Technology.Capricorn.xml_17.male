Much to my delight, PBS made a series based on that book.  I actually marked my calendar (ok, I wrote it in my PDA) for it.  How dorky of me.  But I missed it.  Sadness.  Luckily, they've released it in Quick Time and Real-Video formats, so anybody with a broadband connection (or a slower one and a  lot  of patience) can watch the  urlLink PBS Elegant Universe miniseries .  The miniseries doesn't go quite into the depth that the book did.  Also, the miniseries brought up a few other issues.  One that stuck out in my mind: if gravitons can leave the Brane, wouldn't that violate mass/energy conservation?  I probably just need to read more string theory.
