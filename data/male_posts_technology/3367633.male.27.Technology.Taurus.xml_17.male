LOL I have no idea what that was about.   So I had my interview for the job down in Huntington today. It was very very pleasant and very quick, only 25 mins. Its nice to interview with some one you have worked with for a job he knows you did. The funny thing is that the job is still not posted and I don't think my manager knows yet or not. Ohio well as soon as its posted he will know as my application is going to go in. By talking to him today it looks like the job would start some time in mid July.   My friend Alec has his interview with fraud today. I am so happy for him. Its a nice job and I think that he will do wonders in the position.
