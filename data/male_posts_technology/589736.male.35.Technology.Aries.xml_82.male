Correct if I'm wrong, but NATO was formed to combat the Warsaw Block (which died 10-15 years ago).  The Warsaw Block was held together by the USSR (aka Russia).  Why do we need NATO anymore if Russia is such a good friend that it is joining the very organization that participated in its defeat during the Cold War?!?!?  Something does not add up here.
