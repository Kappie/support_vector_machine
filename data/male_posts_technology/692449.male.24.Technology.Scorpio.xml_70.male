With allegedly selling arms to Iraq(along with Russia, US, and China) and allegedly hiding Iraqy leaders their future prospects don't look very good. I'm curious as to how big the American empire will reach within the next 5 years or the next 10. We have decided to do anything to support our lifestyle including invading other countrys so we can strip their resources. Syria will become the next big Adidas manufacturer. Now that we've supposedly won the war by taking Baghdad the press is going to vanish. There will be no coverage for the puppet goverment or the exploitation of the Iraq's oil.
