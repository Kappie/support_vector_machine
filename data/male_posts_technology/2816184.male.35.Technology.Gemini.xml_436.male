The premier french battleship, and one of very few battleships actually built that respected the 35,000 ton displacement limitation set forth in the Washington Treaty.  The  Richelieu  sported numerous unique systems, such as foil-skinned bouyant foam capsules to prevent taking on too much water from torpedo hits, excellent void and and water filled torpedo blisters, exceptionally well designed armor, some of the best (and longest range) 15 inch guns ever built with a unique loading system. Although it started life with a relatively weak anti-aircraft system on par with the Vittorio Veneto, it was refitted by the Allies during its rather eventful history to carry a much heavier anti-aircraft suite. This class was retired in the 1950s-1960s, with the  Richelieu  being finally scrapped in 1970.   2x4 15/45 9 6/55 12 3.9/45 12 37mm (pre-refit #1) 24 13.2mm (pre-refit #1) 56 40mm (post-refit #1) 48 20mm (post-refit #2) 28 57mm (Jean Bart, post-war) 20 20mm (Jean Bart, post-war)     urlLink   Battleship Quiz     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
