For work I am in the process of rewriting the TCP Port Widget in terms of the new TCP Object.  This is interesting because I am having to expand the TCP Object and the underlying Dynbuff to "do the right thing" :D   Left work a couple of minutes before 9pm to go have dinner with Posh.  She has been my friend for a couple of years and is moving to Phoenix, AZ.   I'm gonna miss her.  I have an old friend down in AZ that has been bugging me to visit her.  I will have to take her up on that and stop down so I can visit all my friends that have moved down there.  Went home after that around 10:20pm. Traffic was bad around the eye sore that is the stadium.  Got gas and then when I went for my car wash the car wash was blocked.  Good times.  Have to get my car washed next week.
