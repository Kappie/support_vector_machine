That's right, I was sitting on a wonderfully spacious (okay, it was almost tomb-like)  urlLink Amtrak  train for six hours on Tuesday night.  Let me tell you, there's not much to look at on the south side of Newark New Jersey.  Why was I stuck on a south bound train, you ask?  Especially when I had just returned from Northern Virginia two nights prior?  Well, and I'm serious now, I had to go back to attend my girlfriend's grandfather's funeral.  It's really sad, actually.  We just visited him in the hospital on Sunday night, and he seemed fine.  It was a shock to everyone, including me.
 
 So here I am, three days later, still in Northern Virginia.  I've learned a few things over the past few days.  Here's  a selection in no particular order:
 
   I love my girl a whole lot.
  Jewish funerals are extremely drawn out, extremely draining affairs.
  New Jersey Transit sucks. 
 
 That is all.
