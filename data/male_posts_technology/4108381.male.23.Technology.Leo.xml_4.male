It's actually fairly exciting but the problem is that with bars and late night places I work an 8 hour day then I work until 10 or later that night at the actual go live.  It leads to a very tiring day.  Today was one of those days.  The only difference between this and my other go lives is the amount of very attractive women at this location.  Two were border line hot but still way out of my league.  Heck I don't even know what sport they were playing.  Overall it was a positive, if not breathtaking, day.
