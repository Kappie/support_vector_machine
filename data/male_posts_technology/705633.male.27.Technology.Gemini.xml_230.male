I made a long island iced tea that could have been used to degrease an engine, it was excellent. Baity came around as well and we played a cool drinking game (but not as good as the infamous  "Chicken" .. BUCKAAAAYE!) where you throw a fag packet in turns and have to drink depending on how it lands. An hour later everyone was pretty well plastered, Baity especially, performing his ritual technicolour yawn party piece. I found him passed out on the floor of the bathroom (silly, silly, silly..) and covered the poor sod with a towel and stuck a pillow under his head. I woke up this morning with a red PVC bra stuck to my face, which I seem to remember wearing on my head at some point.  Anyway, splashing it tonight. I'm in the mood for some loud, jumpy jumpy RAWK music. Toodles.
