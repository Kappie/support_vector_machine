I've heard that with long term marriages, when a wife dies the husband will surely die within a year. It's true for johnny cash.  It puzzles me, partly that women do not know the power they hold over us, partly that when they do, they become someone that we do not want to be with. Or is it that some women can use sex as a powerful weapon. Where a man can assault with sex, he can hardly ever manipulate with it. I've known men that would do just about anything to get into a womans pants.   Now I'm babbling, it's 3:30 am and I'm going to sleep.  Peace and love-
