It wasn't enough to slow me down and make me late today but it was definitely enough to keep me awake.  I hate how when you're driving behind a big ass huge semi and the splash guards aren't working.  It really hinders your driving vision.  Oh well I'm still alive and kicking.  There was only a section of the trip that was a traffic jam.  It was where 294 splits from 94 but after that it was smooth sailing.  I think I left around 5:20 Central time and got to work at 9 AM.  I dawdled around looking for a smoke to bum because I didn't have any for the whole trip.  I also didn't buy any to follow my little plan.  We'll see how this works.  So Friday drive was fun.  I really could have made it in about 3 hours 15 minutes.  Oh well, traffic in Chicago at 6:30 pm is BRUTAL but I finally made it to the Skyway.  That was fun.  Every 1/4 mile there's a turn around for the cops but everyone else was doing 85/90 so it was great.  Pretty much got from Chicago to MI in about an hour and from the border to EL was about 2 hours.  The damn traffic to get downtown was the real bummer there.  So I finally got to EL and saw Meghan.  That was nice, real nice.  After "catching up" we went to Taco Hell for some grubbage.  Wow, talk about drunk ass punks.  They were all wasted.  Everyone that was eating or just ordering was either blushing or really pale.  It was hard to believe that some time ago me and my friends were once part of that general drunken populous.  It was a whole lotta fun but man, I must've been a real ass.  Hmm...oh well.  So we got food and proceeded back to her place and eat food.  We played Super Mario 3.  I was pathetic.  I couldn't do shit.  I was even frustrated enough to mess up my sweetie's chance for a 5-up so that she wouldn't leave me in the dust but she got me back anyways.  That was a nice Friday.  Saturday.  It was beautiful outside and we got up too early, well I did, I kinda woke her up.  We got up around 10 or so, layette in bed for a couple more hours.  We got up and got cleaned up and headed for a little drive to soak in the sun and warmth.  We drove around campus, and around EL for a little while.  That was fun.  We then went to the mall for some fast food.  Looked at some video games, searched for the Dance Dance Revolution game pad to dismantle and make into the real box thing that have the the arcades.  Found a couple but didn't get the price.  Eh, I'll figure it out so that I can have them for my new apartment for people to try out.  That should be fun.  We went to this one store, King Dollar and found a retarded badminton set.  $1.06, hell yeah!  We played that for a little while until the projectiles that were being hit back and forth finally broke and no more playing outside.  I also found out that Meghan was pretty good with the table tennis paddle.  Her apartment community is really cool.  Free pool, foosball and ping pong along with two full court basketball  courts I think, there's probably tennis somewhere and there's a jacuzzi that was operational (it was outside too).  That was Saturday morning, little afternoon.  She then drove to St. Joes to eat at El Rodeo and watch The Passion.  Food was good.  I guess I was getting loud because of the 46 Ounce margarita for $8.50.  Holy shit they make it a little strong too.  Heard the fart stories, fucking hilarious.  I couldn't belive that Ted farted in the middle of the movie.  I don't even remember what part but I do remember that the people sitting in front of Ted just looked at each other after hearing the fart, started to giggle a little and continued to watch the movie.  I mean their heads just snapped and looked at each other at the wrong point of the movie.  It was also the first time that the cost of a date was shared.  She paid for the movie (insisted on paying for the movie) and I paid for dinner.  We went back to their house and watched more TV (SI Swimsuit show) with Meghan and Ted.  Not much talking about the film, just chillin.  We went to bed around 1.  Hey Teddy, the room is clean.  weren't disrespectful, promise.  And that was the end of the day.  It was kinda sorta, pretty busy I guess.  Sunday.  Got woken up by the dog, Zeeke (is that right?) around 8 or so but we went back to sleep.  Breakfast was served around 10:30-11?  It was good.  Thanks again, good bacon and waffles.  mmm.  Hung out for a little while more and went back to EL.  We stopped by at the Oriental store and bought curry mix and some roasted green peas with wasabe.  We then went to Meijer for by the rest of the dish (beef, bell pepper, onion, carrots) forgot the potatoes and the rice. (Thanks for driving again sweetie).  Showered and went to Pinball Pete's for the Dance Dance Revolution Challenge 2004 part 1.  She kicked my ass hard.  I sucked.  I did get a B in one of the rounds that we played (yeah played 16 or so rounds and I only won 2 of them).  I got super sweaty and I wasn't even wearing a jacket.  Meghan got a little winded so we went for a little walk around the block and bought a slurpee (Thanks!).  We went back to the apartment and chilled and took a nap.  It was a really nice nap on the couch where I completely forgot where I was and didn't care because I had her in my arms.  Woke up around 7 and proceeded to prepare the curry.  Meghan diced up the red peppers and I cut up the onion and carrots and started to saute the meat the onions.  Making dinner together was also nice.  I liked that a lot.  I messed up the rice.  It was a little undercooked but the sauce made up for it.  I wish I had eaten some for breakfast so I wasn't so hungry but I knew if I ate I would've been late, Oh well.  We watched parts of the Academy awards.  It was a nice clean sweep by LOTR:ROTK this year.  Must've been a real bummer for the movies that had to compete against that juggenaught.  Poor Seabiscuit.  Oh well.  Not my problem.  Sophia Coppola also won an Oscar for Lost in Translation.  That was pretty cool to be noticed for your work.  Pretty cool.  Favorite was Chalise Theron and how she looked along with Naomi Watts.  Both pretty pretty ladies.  She finished her homework and we went to bed.  That's it for my weekend.  It was very enjoyable.    urlLink Here  are some pics of the weekend.  I especially like the one where Ted look like he's on the cross infront of that Church Bus thing with a banner hanging in front.  I beliveit's the last pic...maybe
