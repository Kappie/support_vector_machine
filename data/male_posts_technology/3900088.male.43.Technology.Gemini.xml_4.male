Well I thought is was too good to miss and ended up taking it home, hoping to sell for few bucks. Well after some investingation on the local on-line trade.me it turns out there are lots of lasers (in apparently perfect working order) for sale at next to nothing with aboslutley no bids, Looks like I'm left with a large and heavy door-stop, that pleases my partner, Maria heaps..
