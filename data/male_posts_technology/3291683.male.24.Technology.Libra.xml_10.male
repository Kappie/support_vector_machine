The old one died only a week or two ago; I actually think that Wizards of the Coast killed all of the Gamekeeper stores, though I haven't bothered to confirm that, since I only know where two are, and one's far enough away that I've visited it twice ever.  Either way, the local one closed.  I expected that the store would be empty for a while...  But to my surprise, that was just entirely false, according to my friend.  He says there's a store there already, being all store-like and doing store-ish things.  (Stores are notorious for those types of activities, you know.)  Since my wife is busy this evening, and I'm already so close to the mall, I'll stop by on the way home and see what I can see.  Should be interesting.  So the newest thing from my friendly neighborhood online forum that annoyed me was someone who said that my explanation that napalm primarily affects a metal object through conducting heat (as opposed to melting it, burning it, convecting heat, radiating heat, or anything else) defied the laws of physics, without actually giving a counter-argument to anything I had said.  He said my explanation meant that lasers should cause heat to the targets they hit (ummm, they typically do) and that flamethrowers should cause heat (again...  They do).  Ugh.  Grrr.  For those who feel completely lost, I'm talking about  BattleTech , a board/war/strategy game that I picked up a long time ago (back in junior high school) and got into more recently.  I started collecting  miniatures  and painting them just a year or two ago.  I don't think any pictures of my models are online, but there are a bunch at  Lords of the Battlefield  and  Camo Specs Online .  The former is a random community website with a highly active forum; the latter is specifically a bunch of camo schemes from "real world" military units in the game.  There are a lot, like hundreds or maybe even thousands, of units, and some have never actually been given more than a one-sentence description of their paint scheme, but others have been done up in great detail and artwork.  My favorite faction is a little one-planet independant waaaay out on the fringes of humanity, which models itself after an ancient order of knights.  They're known as the Brotherhood of Randis, the military arm of the Fiefdom of Randis, on the planet of Randis IV.  Blue-and-silver.  I have maybe five or six models done up in their colors; every time I mean to do more, I get distracted and never quite get around to it.  There's actually a contest coming up, now, that I want to do this for...  There's a tournament called the Martial Olympiad.  It is a series of scenarios, where you register with a faction and a force and play the scenarios against other people for points.  The highest-scoring person worldwide (there are European, Australian, and even Russian players; or were last year, at least) gets a prize.  But this year, Camo Specs is running a painting contest simultaneously, where you have to paint up your force in the colors of a unit from your faction.  I'm looking forwards to it.  Plus, it'll be kinda cool to have your units in the correct colors, rolling (or walking, or hovering, or flying) across the battlefield.  :)  And for those of you who aren't quite so militarily inclined, my wife is working her way up to trying to convince me to get a new cat.  This one is a cat called Mouse, who lives in the adoption agency's cages at the local Petsmart.  He looks weirdly like Lady in coloration and pattern, to the point you almost think they're related, except we know they can't be TOO closely related, unless someone's lieing or mis-informed.  He's listed as only a year and a half old, meaning he's too close in age to Lady to be either father or a second litter from her mother (brother?  I suppose...).  Her litter was four kittens; however, the only other one with her coloration was female, not male.  The males were both yellow-and-white with long hair.  So it's just a coincidence, I guess, but it's a cute one.  Either way, my wife has fallen in love with this cat, and is starting to get defensive about him.  She's gonna make a push for adopting him soon, and it's tough.  On the one hand, he really IS cute, and I wonder if our cats would get along better with an even number (4) rather than 3.  On the other hand, he's got a $90 "adoption fee" (ha, ha...  But the agency DOES have to survive, and so I don't begrudge them the fee.  I just think the name is...  Odd), he'd be a fourth cat when I'm allergic and three occasionally is difficult for me, and we already have one cat more than people when it comes to trying to give attention and affection.  Plus, of course, the upkeep costs of feeding another cat, and using more litter, and cleaning up after him...  Well, I have to run and get out of here.  Hope your evening goes well.
