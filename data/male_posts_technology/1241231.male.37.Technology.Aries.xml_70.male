Amnesty cited the case of eight-year-old Hanan Saleh Matroud, who was fatally shot in the stomach in Karmat Ali on August 21, 2003 while soldiers from Company B of the 1st Battalion of the Kings' Regiment were patrolling the town.  It quoted an eyewitness as saying: "Hanan was standing in the alley about 60 to 70 metres (yards) from the armoured vehicle. Suddenly a soldier aimed and fired a shot which hit Hanan in her lower torso".  Two months later the British army sent a letter to the girl's family acknowledging: "A soldier concerned for his own safety and the safety of his patrol fired a warning shot into the air in an attempt to disperse... stones throwers."......
