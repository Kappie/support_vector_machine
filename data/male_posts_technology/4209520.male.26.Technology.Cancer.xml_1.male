Actually I was too lazy to start a website that I wanted to put a blog on, so I have decided to start here and maybe move to my own site later.  I figure I will just put observations and rants on here as most people do, but I don't know if I will tell my friends about it. It makes it kinda difficult to complain about someone if they read it and get pissed and kill me. So for now I will not tell anyone.  Now for....drum roll.....My first rant!  I've lived with Jenny for years and for some reason we can only get along for a couple days at a time. Part of this is my terrible need to add my input to conversations and her being stuborn about my opinions or my facts.  For example she is pissed at me for disagreeing with her about weight gain, I said it could not happen unless a person injested something to increase mass. You know the whole Law of Conservation of Mass thing. She said that people can gain weight without eating or drinking anything. Despite what she thinks I value her opinion and belive she is very knowledgeable about medicine. So I ask: where does the weight come from? Her response: It comes from the lymphnatic system. So I say ok but where does it get the extra mass from, does it come from no where?  This leads to me being stupid because I don't know anything about medicine or biology and she sees this everyday at work.  The thing that really pisses me off is that I relinquished, I gave up. On the first day, the above fight was from today when she brought it up again.  How did this all start you ask?  Jenny: I gained 35 pounds...(and some other things about urine color). Me: Wow, that must have taken a few days to build that much up. Jenny: What do you mean? It was overnight! Me: How is that you to get the weight from somewhere? Jenny: (Pissed off mumbles and wanders off) Me: Sorry, go ahead.  See I left didn't fight about I tried to stop it as it happened. The only thing I didn't say was Jenny you are right I am wrong, by some mirical you have been given 35 pounds of extra mass out of thin air!
