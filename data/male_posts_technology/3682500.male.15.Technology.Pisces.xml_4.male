Well, that's the good part; the bad part is that they are still in beta.  So google decides to send out invitations to some exclusive people (active bloggers, and others) and they can invite a limited number in as well and yada yada. Read more about it somewhere else.  Anyways, there is literally a craze going on as people are tearing themselves apart to get a gmail account, asking everyone on the internet, spamming, selling their arms, virginity and whatnot on ebay for it...WHAT THE MONKEYS PEOPLE!?!?! The reason to rush? Well the only reason most people give is that the names will all be taken by the time it comes to them. So freakin' what? Who cares enough to go get an account and pay for it on ebay or spend their precious time clicking refresh over and over again  urlLink  [more info]  , asking strangers on the internet (although a much better approach) but they are literally spamming message boards while doing it. CMON PEOPLE, CAN YOU NOT WAIT!?! It's ridiculous but it's happening. Watch what happens a few months later when gmail comes out...the craze will vanish instantaneously. Who will care who got a gmail account first...everyone will have one, too. You might be special for a while, but just like with Pokemon or Star Wars or anything else, it'll just be bland.  Second issue...1gig of space. Hello? Is anybody actually going to use that much space? Yes they will and google is ready for it. But then there are others of us who can't even fill up our hard drive with that much space (not including the OS itself) so how are we going to deal with 1gig? Never delete a message again, even if it's spam, get a nice big spam collection.  For those of you still waiting for a gmail for the purpose of 1gig, use  urlLink SpyMac  instead for now, even if you hate macs. They will also give you 100mb of hosting space and 250mb on top of that for a picture gallery.  For those of you waiting to get a unique name for gmail, the names already taken, too bad. :P  Signing out, Reality Corp.  realitymaniac@spymac.com
