The uphill part was steep, but with the early start time and cool weather, I felt great.  Things got a little hairy at the top, where the trail is narrow and there are large, sharp rocks to navigate over and around.  The downhill was hellish.  A fast, narrow trail with many switchbacks, overgrown with roots and made even worse by rocks.  I tried to keep up with the fast-moving crowd coming downhill, but after wiping out 2 or 3 times, I slowed my pace considerably and let the mountain goats pass me by.  I finished in 3:21.  My calves and quads were hammered worse than any other race I've done.  I finished 84th in the Men's division.
