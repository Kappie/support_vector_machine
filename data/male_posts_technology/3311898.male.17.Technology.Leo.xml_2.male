But if you don’t, or if you attend elsewhere, Mr. Singletary is a teacher who, to the best of my knowledge, loves public schooling more than anyone I can think of. Don’t understand why? Take a stroll by the math wing at about... 742 AM, just after the first bell rings. You’ll undoubtedly find him standing on the corner SCREAMING the praises of public education. Every morning like clockwork its "OFF TO FIRST PERIOD! DONT BE LATE ITS A GREAT DAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY TO LEARN!!! STREATCH YOUR BRAIN CELLS EXCERCISE YOUR NUERONS!! DONT BE LATE BECAUSE IF YOURE LATE YOU MISS KNOWLEDGE, YOU MISS KNOWLEDGE YOU MISS POWER!! ITS A BEAUTIFUL DAY OUTSIDE AND ITS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL INSIDE ITS A GREATTTTTTTTT DAYYYYYY TO LEARN!!" This continues up until the 1st period bell rings. Its quite possible the most annoying, obnoxious and morale lowering events one can be put through morning after morning.   I used to stand idly by and watch this horrid display of over exuberant school spirit, hating it internally and wanting nothing more than for him to blow a vocal chord out so I'd never have to hear his unfounded praise again. Just the other night however I was dreading going to school the next day, and Singletary's voice entered into my head and it sparked something inside of me. I decided time had come for action. No one else was going to tell this guy to knock it off so of course I, being the only one at school to actually care about things I am vehemently against, decided to write him a three page essay depicting in detail the vast array of problems and negative issues of the American public education system. I then sent the essay to Jay and he added a paragraph about socialism in schools today.  The very next day, I waited in the hallway of the math wing for Singletary. When he inevitably came to begin his morning pep talks like a rooster having to crow every single morning, I approached him and gave him the essay. He looked shocked; either that I had the nerve to openly challenge with such an intimidating paper, or that I took to time to actually write it. Whatever the case, he took it, said he'd read it and get back to me.  Just today, I went out into the hallway to see if he was there. He came up and told me he would be coming to my 4th period study hall today to discuss my views with me. This should be interesting. Right now its only 3rd period, but there’s only about 10 minuets left to class so I’m preparing for what I expect to be a heated debate next period, and I’ll add the results in a play-by-play synopsis 7th period when I can access a computer again.  Okay its 7th period now. Turns out things didnt go as "heated" as I had expected. Singletary came into my study hall period and asked me to get up from my table and follow him into some quiet side-room away from everyone else. He then proceeded to tell me that the essay I wrote for him was one of the most well written and coherent essays anyone's ever given him, including in any of his actual classes. He then explained that he realizes that the system isn’t perfect and is in need of some changes, but he told me that it seems as though I demonize teachers too much for the things we are being taught. He explained that as far as individual learning goes, with class sizes the way they are it would be near impossible to cater to every single person's individual learning needs, and that teachers do their best to ensure that everyone is grasping the material by presenting it in visual (notes and demonstrations) audio (explaining the material verbally) and hands on (projects) methods. He said that most teachers will then review how the majority of the students respond to each method and focus on improving the ones that students dont perform well in. This particular example makes sense, however further into the conversation he started to reveal his weak areas. He touched on the part of my essay where I mentioned that school board officials are all government employees and therefore are controlled by a government who doesn’t necessarily have our education on the top of their priority list. He combated this statement by saying that the school board officials are all elected by the parents and in that way, parents have a choice in who makes the decisions in their school district. Now wait just a minuet, last time i checked the parents weren’t the ones going to school. I told him that I felt as a student I should be able to vote about whose educating me. The obvious answer was that i cant by law being that I'm not 18 yet. As you can see, no practical solution to this problem other than the suggestion that I appear and speak at town meetings was reached.   He then went on to address my statement that I made about how most people who have been taught their whole lives that teachers are the givers of knowledge and on their own cant learn anything new, go out into the world and become complacent followers. To this, Singletary asked me to call state and local town officials and get figures for how many people send in emails, letters or calls opposing or questioning their new policies, laws, programs etc. He told me he was confident that many people do opine to public officials and government representatives very often, and furthermore that these officials care what the people think and use their opinions and views in their own decision making process. I has not previously called and asked this question to any officials so I couldn’t present him with any figures I knew at the time, but I told him that I could say with almost absolute certainty that not NEARLY enough people care enough to make a stand. I gave him the example of a person getting their taxes hiked and complaining to themselves but not openly questioning city hall about the need for the tax hike, and he told me he knows alot of people like that, and he realizes it happens alot. He then offered no actual solution or option to this problem. Yet another issue left unanswered or resolved.  Singletary brought up my comments on how grades dont really reflect actual intelligence in that some of the people on the honor roll are the same ignorant thugs who just figured out how to cheat on a test or "cram" before a test and not actually retain any information at all. He replied to this with "In a scary sense, thats actual individual learning in that kids have independently learned how to pass." So I replied with "Well doesnt that just defeat the whole purpose of education in the first place in that theyre not really retaining any information you're being taught?" To this he realized he had no real answer and replied with a brief and shady "well... you dont really KNOW what they retain and what they dont...." and then quickly changed to the next subject ;)  Lastly, Singletary addressed my concerns with the need for certain subjects in school, such as chemistry or three required years of math, or foreign language. I explained how i will never need chemistry in my life, but the fact that i was made to take it and failed, which negatively affected my overall GPA. His answer was well thought out. He said that the reason we have to learn things like that is not necessarily for our career benefit, but more for our overall education as people. He said a real world example would be the issue over destroying the lordship marshes to expand the runway. He said in order to cast an educated vote on the matter depends on your ability to understand the consequences of ruining nature and the effects it would have on the stratford Eco-system. He said without knowledge like that it would be that much easier for the government to control people by telling them whatever they wanted, and without the education to tell fact from fiction, you would just blindly believe them. I told him if that were the case I would like to see real world education courses required in schools such as economics, politics, personal finance, etc. He agreed and said that requiring the all-encompassing "civics" course was stride in that direction, but is obviously not enough.  Over all I enjoyed our discussion. From the way he spoke he is a much smarter man that I had expected. I respect his views and I must say, out of every pro-education person I have talked to, he had the most well thought out answers. The fact remains however that many problems are still left unsolved, and no one seems to be trying to change those. One thing I will take his advice on is speaking at town meetings from now on. I plan to do so as much as possible. I didn’t post my original essay to Singletary here because it would make this entry even longer than it already is, but if you would like to read it, say so in the comments and I will post it.
