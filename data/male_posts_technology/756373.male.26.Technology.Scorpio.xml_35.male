Bought a 40X CDRW and a 40gig hard drive. It's fun to burn a CD in 3 minutes. :D --- Todays rant regards  urlLink dissing of scrubs . Thanks to PennyArcade, I happened upon quite an enlightening article regarding 'Playing to win'. Which is admirable and all. But what struck me is just how  trite  and mocking the article's author was concerning us 'scrubs'. Now, I'm not going to go into the ethics of pro vs amateur gaming and all that shit. What I  am  going to bitch about is retards who diss those of us who fork out our hard earned dollars to buy games. You think it's the pro-gamers who keep the gaming-industry running? Don't make me laugh. They buy maybe a single game every year, and play that and only that. 24/7. Not only that, but they win the tournaments and take the prize money which coincidentally is made up of the entrance fees we scrubs pay to perhaps have a shot at competing, or even merely spectating. We SCRUBS pay their salaries, we SCRUBS buy the games that they play. If we were ALL pro's, if we ALL played to win, do you think there'd be a gaming industry at all? Think about it. THEN diss me for being a scrub you elitist pricks.
