I finally got my divorice papers and ruled and judged on the things i wanted and fought for in court. Wow...  I'm now in college, wow..thought i would never do it, *L* crazy but im in, as pre-law, so gear up cory, its time to kick butt, and i can do it. With the support of everyone helping me through life, thank you. I know sometimes you can't change the past, but as for the future i still think and thank everyone from the bottom of my heart.  I'm checking out a few new hotspots, and soon to be moving to OKC, or dallas, depends on which of the directions i want to go.   Well im gonna close, but hey life is good! 4 Years to go for the BAR!!! LOL  lord help me lmao  -W|CKED
