Funny thing is, he ordered his a week before mine, and paid extra for 'fast' shipping, whilst I used 'economy'. Oh well, I guess economy is the way to go!    Fishs  Tomorrow I am going fishing for  urlLink fishs . I'll probably grab me some plants as well. I might even post a photo somewhere so ewes can check it out in all it's  urlLink majesty .
