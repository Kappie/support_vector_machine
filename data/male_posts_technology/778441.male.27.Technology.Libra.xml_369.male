No fish had been known to emit sound from its anus nor to be capable of producing such a high-pitched noise.  Ahaa!! Now this is something I did not need to know!! And they have even recorded it for your listening pleasure. Click  urlLink here  (.wav file) to listen to the fish fart!!   yuck!!   And the biologists, not usually known for their sense of humour, have named the noise as Fast Repetitive Tick (FRT) !!  How creative!!
