It has 5 floors with everything from a kid's room to a coffee shop (Starbucks of course) and a gift shop.  From what I hear it is being noticed internationally.  The inside was very open with awesome decorations.  Anyways I just could not believe it was a library from the outside.  Cool stuff I think.   urlLink    Inside the Library urlLink      urlLink    Seattle Library  urlLink
