Anyway, if you follow the link in that article, you come to a very funny Accordion Guy piece.  I'll wait  urlLink here  while you read it.  So things are still a little slow here at (Large Company Willing to Employ Me) and I hadn't read that message in a while, and I was reading   urlLink The Adventures of Accordion Guy in the 21st Century   anyway, so I searched for the time-traveller article again. Writing that good should be savored.  This is old news to some, but  urlLink  Wired  found the spammer last fall.  He sent  me  some spam earlier this year - it's long since deleted by now - and I thought he was just a copy-cat.  I'm spending the weekend at this year's  urlLink Western Regional Science Fiction Convention , and it just seemed appropriate somehow. See y'all Tuesday.
