Now there is a Ken Jennings  urlLink drinking game  to make that half hour of Jeopardy even more fun. This is the best part of the game:    The banter between Alex and Ken becomes disturbingly intimate. A few nights ago, one of KenJen's victims mentioned in the chat segment that if he beat the champ that night, he planned to get a tattoo of Alex Trebek in celebration. This anecdote inspired an odd KenJen riff about having 30-odd tattoos of Alex all over his body, one for each night of his winning streak thus far. A mental image like that one is definitely an excuse for a drink.   I think Alex totally has a crush on Ken.
