Well, accept for callings from my client which keeps complaining their workstation can't get into the network. To make things worse, they put the blame on us by saying after the last time we went for maintenance ~ which is last week ~ the whole wresting in the office can't connect to the network. But I don't recall meeting any problems when I was there. Weird!   Therefore, now I have to make a replacement server for them. But strange thing is, the Windows NT is not working probably. It doesn't respond to my first press on the keyboard, but works for the second press. I wanted to blame on the keyboard is lousy but I don't think it is. Pathetic! And because it acted so strangely, which causes I keep pressing the wrong thing so now I've thought of a way to overcome this problem ~ Just press once then press on the arrow left key, which is not used for any purpose in the installation. ;)  Well things got worse now, I just had to press 3 times to get the button function. What the heck!!! Do I have to do this all the way till the installation is complete?? That is killing....   That's all I have to talk for now or else I'll never finish installing that stupid stuff. Later I have to install the Oracle. Just hope It will not do the same thing to me =(   Bye!!
