A recent BBC article highlighted the abuse of work computer networks, pointing out that prison sentences may be in the future.         But not just for the offenders – for the senior people in the company as well.         In the most serious cases, some companies have child pornography or other illegal images or material stored on their corporate servers or workstations – material that they know nothing about, but which could land them in court for negligence.         With employees needing access to the internet more and more in their daily work, it can be hard to police the system and ensure that nothing’s there that shouldn’t be. Yet it’s as vital as keeping up-to-date accounts.         Just imagine for a moment that your company was caught. You didn’t know about it, but it’s there anyway. So it makes the papers. Will your clients believe you didn’t know? You’re prosecuted for negligence. Will your prospects think that’s good publicity?        And what if you’re convicted?           Which costs more – policing your network effectively, or the cumulative effects of a prosecution on your company?       The answer is clear.       So let’s look past the gloom and doom, cut through the headlines and talk about what you can do to ensure your network stays clean as a whistle.        Have a      Policy              I know, I know – these days you need to have a policy for everything. But in this case, it’s important to have a strong IT Use policy that your employees understand and adhere to. Let’s be honest – if your staff want to access content that may be inappropriate, the workplace probably isn’t the best place for them to be doing it.       Obviously, you need to get legal advice to ensure what you’re doing is formed and handled the right way, and doesn’t fall foul of regulations on employee rights to privacy.. My disclaimer here –  I am not a lawyer .           Lay down clearly what constitutes acceptable use of the company network and internet connection. How much freedom you grant your staff is up to you – some companies make internet access available only upon the permission of a manager, others allow much greater levels, even including the use of programs like MSN Messenger to their staff. Decide what you feel is acceptable, and set it down clearly.       Make sure your staff understand what is not acceptable, and that clear disciplinary guidelines are established for breaches of policy. Make it clear and easy to understand. Remember, it’s your reputation that will be damaged if that obscene email gets sent, or those illegal files are found on your servers.     Ensure that every member of staff has signed to confirm that they understand and will abide by your policy. I’ve normally had to sign an IT policy at the commencement of any contract, to confirm that I understand that company’s terms of use.     Get Secure,      Keep Secure        If you read and acted on my last article, you should already have a decent degree of security on your office systems. If you didn’t act on it – well, don’t say I didn’t warn you.          Beause I did.         At length.         So you have – hopefully – a nice strong firewall protecting your data. Robust Antivirus protection keeping more of the nasties away.    Your network, and all the machines on it, should all be patched with the latest updates from the manufacturer.          Keep it that way.          Now, let’s look at a bit more of what we can do to prevent abuse of the system – and, ideally, accidents which may result in perceived abuse as well.         First – your internet browser. I bet you’re using Internet Explorer, aren’t you? You are . . . I can tell.        Bad move.       Internet Explorer allows certain code to run in the background, where you don’t see it. This can allow malicious programs to run, installing nasties like premium-rate dialers and so on. And you’ve all seen the myriad pop-up advertisements you can get when you’re surfing the Web.         So the quickest fix is to change the internet browser your staff use. There’s a range of options, but a good, quick, free choice is Mozilla ( urlLink www.mozilla.org ) which is a development of the Netscape Navigator. You can block pop-ups and malicious scripts quickly and easily. That stops your team from suffering all sorts of pop-up problems if they simply mistype a URL.         Secondly, invest in good content filtering. There are a couple of ways to do this – either you can use dedicated software to filter each individual desktop machine, or you can look at configuring your firewall to block certain websites, IP addresses or keywords.         There are pros and cons with both these methods. Individual filtering may be useful if you have different levels of access required. Firewall-level filtering can help if you need to set a consistent standard.                But be aware, however – if you use keyword filtering, you can sometimes block perfectly innocent sites in an attempt to remain clean. For example, a recent US Government keyword-filtering approach blocked (among others) the words ‘breast’, ‘ass’, ‘sex’ and ‘hot’. Logical, until you try accessing any site researching Breast Cancer (like  breast cancer.com) is now blocked. Or the US Emb ass y website.   Sus sex    Police? Blocked. Oh, and don’t bother trying to get to  hot mail.com. Oops.          So talk to your IT company – we can help, of course, I’m not just doing this from my altruistic nature – and get your system protected.        Monitor and      Clean                Once you’ve got all this funky stuff in place, it’s as much use as a chocolate fireguard if you don’t monitor and check your servers and workstations.         Most operating systems have facilities to allow you to search drives and networks for potentially inappropriate material, and there are programs that can do it for you as well.          If something is found, you need to appoint responsible, mature staff to check and view any dubious content, again working within employee privacy rights.          If something is there, it needs to be found, removed, and action taken. Don’t be tempted to leave it and avoid confrontation. GET IT OFF. Then follow your policy.         Remember, negligence just means not doing something you could reasonably have been expected to do. I think it would be foolish to end up in court for inaction.         Don’t you?
