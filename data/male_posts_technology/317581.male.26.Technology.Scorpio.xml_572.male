Anyway, I started putting my "new" computer together last night. So that was exciting. My parents are coming into town tomorrow and then I'm going paintballing on saturday with Jarred. I've been able to keep my life pretty busy.  I think part of it may have to do with the fact that I'm trying not to slow down and feel too much. A friend recently told me that scorpios are moody and/or have mood swings. I could see that.  Anyway, I'm sleeping- T
