I arrived to see someone get a lovely 3 or 4 second cover up so it looked promising. Didn't manage to get tucked in myself but caught a few beauties all the same. The water was so clear you could see every stone and piece of seaweed on the bottom. As the tide dropped and the sun came out things just got better. Most of the lads stayed out all day long, getting a few sessions in.     Paddling for a left-hander.       They did tend to close out a bit though.  urlLink      Waiting for a good one.  urlLink
