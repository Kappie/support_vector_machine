This morning had a tennis session and it was very useful for me to improve my skills..was focused on hitting the ball on the sweet spot so that my shots would be more determined and predictable. I look forward to the next time i play tennis..especially with Philippe. Guess my game with him has been looooooooooong overdue..something like 5 months? But i got to make sure i improve on my skill first before i start playing with him coz i know he's really good...haha. I don't want to be like the boy in the advert about class 90fm. i.e.."i gotta tell you george...your son holds the racquet...like agassi....with this..he may be..number 1"...oh boy i look forward to it. Gotta improve!!!!
