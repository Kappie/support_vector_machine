I got mine changed from Copenhagen-Stockholm to Copenhagen-Karlskrona (both via Malmo). Karlskrona is the place where my Poly classmate, Marcus, is staying. The RSN had sent him to Sweden for submarine training. Ivy, his wife, accompanied him and she had given birth to baby Zelda sometime in Nov 2002. I’m really quite ecstatic when I think about seeing all of them soon. They are the first close friends I know who’ve already started a family of their own. I’m scheduled to arrive at Karlskrona at 1421 hrs.   1100 hrs  We all departed Copenhagen for Malmo, Sweden. Apparently we were misinformed and should have boarded a slightly earlier train. This caused us to miss our connecting rides to our destinations. Now that I’ve had time to think things through, I think I might’ve overlooked the timing for the earlier train. Anyway, when we arrived at Malmo, I tried to change my ticket for another one (the guys are going straight to Stockholm so their tickets aren’t affected). I was initially told that to pay for a new ticket. But I explained my situation and the ticket attendant decided to change a new ticket for me FOC. Cool! However, my arrival time has now been delayed by a good 2 hrs. I bought a local phone card and gave Marcus a ring to inform him of the delay. It was a pity as he had planned to take me to the Maritime/Marine Museum on my arrival. It seems that I will arrive too late to visit the sights of the small town.   Around 1200 hrs  The guys boarded their train for Stockholm and I still have some time to spare. So I grabbed a map of Malmo and decided to explore outside the station. Naturally I didn’t dare to venture too far and kept one eye on my watch constantly. The train station is located at the edge of the city itself. Malmo looks really nice and peaceful. Of course, being a Sunday, that may be the reason.   1429 hrs  Train departed Malmo for Karlskrona. I managed to arrive around 1641 hrs. The moment I stepped onto the platform, I could see Marcus standing a short distance away. He was in a typical Singaporean attire of T-shirt, Bermuda and slippers. Of course, his short GI haircut was hard to miss too. As I was walking over to him, who should come along but Ivy carrying baby Zelda. It was sweet seeing this family of three. Marcus drove us to a supermarket nearby. After the 5 min drive, they asked if I had bought my ticket from Karlskrona to Stockholm for tomorrow. Alamak! He drove me back to the station but the ticketing office had already closed for about 15 min (4 min after my arrival). I’ve been really careless and forgetful since this morning. Sigh, can’t be helped now. We headed back again to the supermarket, bought some stuff and proceeded back to the family apartment. The flat was nice, cosy and had a spacey living / dining room, a kitchen, a toilet and a bedroom.  They prepared steamboat for dinner while Zelda took her nap. Almost towards the end of the meal, she woke up and Ivy had to prepare her baby food. The couple switched after awhile. I was cute seeing the three of them; Marcus, a happily married father, Ivy, a busy housewife and a 7 mth old Zelda. We had a nice long chat the throughout and after dinner. I played with Zelda a little but I seriously didn’t feel too comfortable carrying her. I’m not sure how tight I had to hold her and I was really afraid of dropping or hurting her somehow. Zelda has Ivy’s nose and Marcus’s eyes and mouth. This was one time that I actually had to be referred to as Uncle Aylwin. Haha. The baby proved to be quite a handful for my friends sometimes but they do seem to be managing very well. Just before midnight, we all decided to go to sleep. I was really quite sad that the day had to end so soon. Had things been perfect, I’d have an extra 2 hrs to spend with my friends, not that it would’ve been enough anyway.
