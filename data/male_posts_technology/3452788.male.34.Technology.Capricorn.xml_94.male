I am seriously thinking about how sharp the knives in the kitchen are, and how many little wounds I could cause without anyone noticing.  I am home again.  I have spent today basically avoiding as much contact as possible.  I called in “sick” to work (one can’t exactly call in “depressed”, can one?) and wrote several items on the laptop, including an excruciating description of last nights abortive runaway attempt.  I stayed in the hideaway until about 12:30, then went out.  Anne asked where I was going, I just said “I don’t know” and left.    As I was driving toward town, I figured I may as well accomplish something since I was off work and not in the mood for anything even remotely fun.  I got the oil changed in the car, then went to get a chronically repaired tire repaired for the 2nd time.  I then stopped at the mall to look at Borders’ books (on depression, my favorite topic!!), then the library, then Staples for a laptop mouse, then home.  As luck would have it, Anne and the kids were just heading out for shopping and errands, so I get another 2 hours of self-loathing in silence  The giants are playing ball tonight, maybe that will help.  On the other hand, maybe I will get shit-faced on scotch and drown in my own vomit.  At this point, I don’t fucking care.  I don’t have the will to fight or live or die or fix things or save a marriage or help kids or help myself.
