Remember that thing I said about hating weddings? Yeah, I guess I'm sort of wrong about that. The only thing I don't like is dancing. I just can't enjoy it. I have no rhythm, and feel like I look like a big douche the whole time I'm gyrating.   The high-lite of the evening was this 4 year old kid who had some SICK dance moves. he was all over the place. If he keeps on track, he'll be a real stud some day.  Fucking-A, being sick is SHITTY. Blowing my nose all the time, having a dry throat, and peeing constantly is the pitts.   ah well. I think it's time to get some sleep. In 8 minutes, it's my birthday.   and I'll be  23.
