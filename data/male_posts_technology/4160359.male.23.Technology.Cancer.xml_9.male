Often-times, I'll be lying awake in bed, waiting to fall asleep, when my brain starts to purge itself of all sorts of odd thoughts. In that time of darkness, these thoughts make sense. I've come up with theories that would solve all of life's problems and bring about world peace. The problem is that its about that time that I fall asleep. Hell if I can remember the thing the next morning.  So this is my Mental Notepad, so to speak. Here, I can jot down whatever pile of garbage that my brain decides to spew out. And I don't honestly expect my Blog to solve all of your problems. In fact, I'm certain that if I get 99% of those Earth-shattering theories out into the light of day, I'll find that they are completely retarded. But then again, that 1% left just might be an answer that someone else has overlooked.  But of course, I'm also going to use this as a sounding board for just about anything I like. You'll probably hear about me, my personal life and thoughts, my girlfriend, my family, my job, and all that other mundane crap that every other blogger in the universe talks about. So enjoy.
