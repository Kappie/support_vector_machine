Jackass was funny in a king of "oh you guys.. you're just CRAZY!" type of way. But Dirty Sanchez has crossed some kind of threshold. I hate to sound like Mary Whitehouse, but I am worried when a guy nailing his cock to a piece of wood is considered easy viewing. It left me rather perplexed and my female companion with a nasty bout of insomnia. And it's on MTV for god's sake! What does a guy shaving his arse cheeks off with grip paper have to do with music?   What will be next, Cilla Black presents "Seal Clubbing Challenge?" Davina McCall chopping up OAPs with a chainsaw? Trevor McDonald drowning kittens in a cheese fondue?
