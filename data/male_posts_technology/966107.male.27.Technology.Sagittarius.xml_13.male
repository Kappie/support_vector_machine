I was really ashamed to see the list of best athletes missing from the names of the people who were the torch bearers representing India. No doubt the Indian Olympic cause can do with a little bit of publicity, but certainly not at the cost of athletes who have sweated their blood for the country  toiled very hard to bring glory to the nation.  It was really shameful to see film celebrities participate in the run and most of them not even able to run properly nor able to hold the torch properly. Is it so hard to understand that importance of the symbol that the torch signifies? They all needed someone to hold their hands just to hold the torch properly.  I sincerely hope that the sports ministry does not do a similar 'Faux Pas' in the future  the athletes get their due in terms of recognition of their effort  monetary benefits. Is Mr.Dutt listening?
