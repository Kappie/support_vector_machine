Written on a piece of [virtual] paper on the web.  I recalled a song by Aqua,  urlLink "Turn Back Time" .   The bolt reminds me I was there  The bolt reminds me I was there   If only I could turn back time  If only I had said what I still hide  If only I could turn back time  I would stay for the night   f only I could (if only I could, if only I could)  If only I could (if only I could, if only I could)  If only I could turn back time...   I'm in the brink of losing someone. Darn.  Ah well... if you could read this. Am I too technical?
