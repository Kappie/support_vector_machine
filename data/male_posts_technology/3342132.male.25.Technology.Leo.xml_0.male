At least it's made the free email market competitive with  urlLink Yahoo  giving 100MB and others like  urlLink Rediff  giving 1GB.    Now, is it really the space that matters? Does size really matter? Yes, it would to a certain extent. But, how much of personal email space would we really be using? Isn't 1GB or even 100MB a bit too much? To gain a better perspective on this, imagine that till a week back Yahoo premium users were getting 25MB for about $19.99! Now, there is a 4 time explosion of previously premium mail space available for free!  Me, not being such an avid mailer would possibly end up using about 10 to 15 MB max. And am sure, most of us fall into this category. So, is the wrong battle being fought? I may be totally wrong here, but as the Mahabharatha says, 'There is no  muni  who has not had an opinion of his own' :-)  The sheer size of these accounts 100MB and 1GB makes them like a virtual drive. So, what would anyone expect from a virtual drive? Find things in them as fast as possible. So, this opens up the pandora's box of Cataloging and searching. Gmail is purported to do most of this. But, all information I have about gmail is second hand as I don't have a gmail account. I do have an yahoo account and their search in mails is still primitive. It lets a full text search, but with that much space means that many more mails. So, unless they improve the cataloging and searching, I don't see this going anywhere.   It is just some bloated email space for me unless they do smart stuff like possibly customized bayesian filtering and meta data management for cataloging. Is the email space going to become a content management space? Maybe, it really is a personal content management space with RSS reading and blogging capabilites inbuilt. Some food for thought.
