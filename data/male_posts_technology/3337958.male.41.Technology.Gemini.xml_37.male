This five or six hour drive promises to be an adventure, and I've committed to doing all of the driving.  A few well placed weaves into the rumble strip about midnight should take care of that, though.  We'll be there through next Tuesday, so I hope you all can put something worthwhile in here during that time.  In the meantime, here's a bunny with a pancake on his head.   Not really.
