Well, I've just finished the first round of tests for this semester, no matter what kind of college student you are, it feels good to be done with them. For me, it doesn't help that I have more work to do than a cheap whore during shore leave.  I have papers, programming projects, grading, and all manner of family obligations to attend to.  So why am I here writing? cause it's the easiest thing on the list to do.  Let me discuss this whole testing thing for a bit.  Lets get it straight - tests make up the majority of your grade. They are very short in length compared ot most of the other work done for classes (unless you're a business major whose only coursework are the tests themselves, I took the classes, don't pretend that's not true, your ruse of "group projects" be damned). Exams are also a high-stress activity, usually preceded by much caffeine, nail biting, and overactive reading.  Now maybe my methods wont' work for a lot of you, maybe they will, but hell, here's my advice to all you test takers, and even if you're not taking tests, we all get quizzed from time to time.  Here's what helps me (use at your own risk).  Wear comfy clothes.  No use being uncomfortable, trying to look good for the ladies (or guys as the case may be).  Trust me that no one else in class is checking you out during this test.  Being comfortable is the first part of being able to focus your mind.    Eat somethign earlier in the day, but do not eat right before the test.  You don't want a gurgling belly irritating you, but you dont' wanna get all dreamland sleepy when trying to remember what the fuck the symbol for projection in relational algebra looks like (it's a large pi symbol btw).    Don't cram right before the exam. Take a freaking break and play some ping pong or something. Those last second mindscrapes usually end up confusing most of us.  It wouldn't hurt to give a cursory glance through some examples right before the exam starts, but if it's 2 hours beforehand, take a breather.  Studying the night before is cool tho.     Study groups only work if you actually study material.. They don't work if you're talking about bullshit.  It's been my expereince that the majority of "study groups" turn into a social gathering in about 20 minutes. Either try to steer the conversation back to study, try to excuse yourself early, or plan ahead so that you can get your people thinking about any questions you have in that first 20 minutes.    Finally, when you're taking the test - focus on it like a motherfucker.  If you don't know the answer to one question skip ahead to the next, don't waste time pondering until you're certain you've got everything that is "for sure" down.  Then go back and do those other questions. for some people this is a time thing, but for me, sitting around trying to do something I"m not sure of breaks my concentration, gets me out of that "zone".  Whichever, it's a tried-and-true strategy.  That "zone" is your best mofoing buddy when you're testing, you'll be able to remember things, maybe even recall whole pages of diagrams and such.    Finally, don't study too much. this is very possible, and will seriously screw you. go over your reading twice and be done with it. you have a question about something, get it answered, remember the answer and stop.  You can overstudy, and it will screw with your head.    Oh ya, and the best tip you'll ever get - go to fucking class, and listen when you're there. put down your calculator with the games, put down the palm pilot with your scribble drawings, hell, put down your pen and just listen. Profs arent' talking to hear themselves, they'd rather not be there either. but it's what makes it work, and they know more than you do, I promise.  I don't know that I've ever had a class where 90% of all the test material wasn't touched on in class.     Another thing - studies show that you can do better on an exam if you can recreate the environment in which you studied the material. So if you learn it in class, all the better, but if you learn it on your own, try to minimize things that you have around you that you won't have in class (like beer, loud music, and your computer screen).  I'm out.
