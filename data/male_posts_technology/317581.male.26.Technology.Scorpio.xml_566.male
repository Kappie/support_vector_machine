I have been taking the bus home, while I still have my bus pass. The powers that be have decided that contractors who have always gotten the bus pass privilege will now be denied. Another way to keep the separation of FTEs and CS. Sometimes I just want to run through the halls yelling, "CS are people too!!!" But I'm sure that would get me fired.  We're hoping that Mike's kid doesn't come tonight, we're getting him the hunger team aqua force season 1 DVD.  Well, I'm sleepy, catch ya later- T
