Who ever thought that show was raunchy must have spent the last ten years in a nunnery. I have seen raunchier paint drying! Add to that the unbelievably bad Lip Syncing and you have a terrible show.. At one stage she was singing one of those girly slow songs while on a trapeze swing type contraption and while "singing" she stopped to scratch her nose and chew her gum!  I have no problem with a bit of lip syncing especially during intense dance routines but when people pay the kinda prices that they were charging for tickets you expect the main person in the show to make a bit of effort and I think that was my main problem with the show, she made no effort.  Over all a very VERY disappointing show.
