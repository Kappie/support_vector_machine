As ignorant as most Male Singaporeans are, they didn't realise my nick is that of a German wine. I don't blame them for that, but they really made me feel disgusted..  Then, she appeared and we chatted. Shes 21, NUS and was quite nice to chat with. Later, i asked for her MSN for more convenient conversation.. Obviously, phone chat is the ultimate goal. But.. after the phone chat, she became kinda distant. I gave some thoughts to it and realised she became distant after i told her i'm not interested in relationships at the moment..  Yup, one of the kind coz i never meet woman like her. She's weird and i gotta admit that.. Hap, why would anybody be so anxious to find a bf?! She is still young, and i always thought that girls would prefer to know the fellow long enough before the friendship advanced to another stage?   Am i wrong?! Gosh... oh well, just to share my thoughts with ya. Going out with Mandy later. Watch her fav Hairy Potter... :/ Frankly, i dun quite like the fellow, coz its too magical?! Anyway, just take it as an entertainment bah. It would be nice to give her some company too, afterall, we have been friends for some years.  I have an interview @ 77th Street tomorrow. This is the first time i applied for something that's in I.T. and i'm not familar with a couple of requirements they mentioned. Perhaps, i should really drop my HR mentality and start to go for jobs that i think i do not meet their requirements fully. Sg's HR is really weird...   Oh well.. read something about Time travel lately.. Intriguing material. It certainly interest and affect me deeply, but i doubt i want to change anything dramatically. My past consist of good times and bad times, and if i were to upset them, God knows what may bring?  Seeya again, Hap  DJ
