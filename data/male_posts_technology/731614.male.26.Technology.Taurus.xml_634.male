They are SO perverse! They think and talk more about sex and are bigger deviants than anyone.) The concept wasn't exactly new to me (I know about the whole chivalric code of chaste lovers sleeping with a sword between them) but the idea a courting couple lying swaddled like mummies or infants, side by side, burning with repressed Hawthorniness--I'm captivated. How did they do it? Who did the actual bundling? Some third party, a sort of dominatrix in homespun, who swaddled the couple and then set them out side by side? And how were they bound, exactly? Were they roped, like harvest sheaves? Were they merely tucked in veerrry tightly? What if you had to pee? It's better than a chastity belt, that's for sure. It would have been oddly comforting, I think, especially on a cold night. All that heat and thrill and tension, immobilized in yards and yards of blankets. It would be like being the pea under all those mattresses in the fairy tales--this hard kernal of unsatisfied longing, muffled and muffled but still burning through, bruising and tormenting the tender flesh. It's really hooked into my imagination. Plus it's oddly disgusting, I imagine the trapped smells and effulgences of dirty pilgrims, the crawling things, the dirt and sweat, how crusty and nasty and scrufulous those blankets must have been, after a long unwashed winter.It's repellant and fascinating.The things people come up with the titillate themselves in the name of virtue. Anyway, I regret not trying the experience, although it could only have ended (as I am sure many puritan liasons did) in Disaster. Anyway, the whole idea of technical virginity or technical chastity fascinates me. So anyone out there with a kinky Puritan fetish, go to it and let me know what it's like.
