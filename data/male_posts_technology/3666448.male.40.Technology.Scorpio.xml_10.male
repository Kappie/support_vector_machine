I'm taking the family  to a hotel in Seattle for the 4th of July and we'll watch the fireworks from Ivars show from the hotel.  Laura had little to no fun last year due to being on bed rest so in December we planned out some fun things to do and reserved the hotel room with a view 6 months in advance.  Get a good rate that way.
