Aaron Perez was bitten so badly that a surgeon at the Memorial Hermann Children's Hospital in Houston spent four hours re-attaching his arm.  But on Monday he appeared at a news conference in Texas, wearing a T-shirt with a picture of a shark open-mouthed.  The boy described how he punched his attacker in the gills after learning how to do it from the television.   Who says TV violence is bad?
