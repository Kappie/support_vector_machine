Was up 'til 3:00 a.m. the night before and up at 8:00 a.m. It wasn't the lack of sleep that affected me. It was the staying up so late. I didn't do much all day. In fact, I haven't done much for the past couple weeks. It has been nice being lazy and not obligated or responsible to do anything but it's gotten old and today I'm bored. I did go out to Sam's Club and got a phone card and over to Walmart and got a nice big pot and stand for the new rubbertree I bought Thursday when Mom was in town. I have it replanted already but came up a little short on potting soil. It'll lst 'til tomorrow when I go out again. It's another one of those stupid people days here in St.Cloud. The way people drive and things they do just reeks if stupidity. That's not to be confused with ignorance. Ignorance doesn't know. Stupidity knows but don't think. I think I'm gonna pass my blog URL on to Louie so she can keep up on what's happening without writing me. I know she gets busy with her family etc. and doesn't have much time to write. Hard to imagine that in another 2 months, we will have been friends for 30 years. I don't think she knows, but back then, I gave her a special place in my heart and no one has ever been allowed there since. I still hold the fond memories there of when we were a couple and even today, I often think of her. I respect her more than anyone except Mom. Once, I let my emotions get out of hand and almost scared Louie off. It was stupid of me. I love her as the oldest and dearest friend I have. I wonder how long we'll stay in touch or if we'll drift apart someday. Who knows what's gonna happen after I get out of school next Winter or where I'll end up or what kind of job I'll have. It's scary! As morbid as it sounds, I figure I only have to do it a few years anyway. Reason being; my dad and his dad both died at 55 years old of sudden heart attacks. I'm guessing there's something hereditary there and with my smoking habit, I expect to follow tradition. More later (or tomorrow)
