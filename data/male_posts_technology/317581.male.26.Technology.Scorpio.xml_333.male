I would buy 3 houses... In one house I would have my friends, my TV's, my video games, my Computers, all my technical stuffs. (1st house)  In one other house, I would have a library, and a fireplace. (2nd house)  In my 3 house, I would have my pool, my pool table and my other fun shiznit. (3rd house)  So I would live in the first house, invite my friends to my 3rd house for fun times(also have wild parties there) and then retreat to my 2nd house whenever I was feeling like I wanted to get away.  So my explanation for not reading as much as i can right now, is that I am too distracted and do not have enough time right now to both be sociable and read alot...  Ahh, it's good to dream.
