Z*lda said she was going to go to a garage sale out by John Deere Road. I was like, ok, sure, go ahead. She comes back awhile later, and as I come into the living room says "I picked this up, is it worth anything?" Just from the shape of the package I knew it was a Palm Pilot, but not what kind. It could of been anything really old as an original Palm One or 1000, or something newer.  Boy was I in for a surprise! I take it out of the bubble wrap, and it's a Palm M515! in perfect/brand new condition!!!! I was like OMFG!!! What did you pay for this! She then said he had $35 on it, but she only had $26 on her, so he sold it to her for that, plus the 3-4 other things she had in her arms!!!  I checked it out on Pricewatch, and it still sells for $241 shipped! OMFG! This is just incredible!!  And it works! Beautifully too! It's got 16 megs of memory, and runs 33mhz, and is color! Now, in a PDA, thats awesome! Plus I can buy one of those new style memory cards to put into it and increase it's ram. I've got tons of software installed on it, and files put onto it already (with other stuff left to transfer yet), and it STILL has 10megs of space left (has 4 megs of memory thats used I'm assuming by the Palm OS 4.01.  This is so frellin kewl!!  Now the youngest is eager as I said if I ever got a new PDA he could have my HandSpring Visor Deluxe. Now he cant wait to get it! :-)
