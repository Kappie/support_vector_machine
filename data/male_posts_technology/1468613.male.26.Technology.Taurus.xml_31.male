I even decided at one point to get a tattoo, as you do, as I was talking to Maree's friend Buggsy, who is a tattoo artist, and he decided that we should do the word 'Enjoy' as in the coca-cola trademark on my tailbone....We all thought it was a great idea...thankfully I have sobered up now, and will rethink that idea at a later date...  The cleaning lady has been, and I must say that she did a wonderful job....she even asked me to get out of bed (which I had returned to after having been to my very early class! doh!), so she could change the sheets and make it for me (that was very nice of her wasnt it! she also did two loads of washing....i didnt know you could wash teatowels!!!!). So at this point, I decided that I would make lunch, but as she was also busy mopping and cleaning everything everywhere, I had to get McDonalds....Poor ME....  So, alas, I am missing you both, but the house is very clean and my tummy very full...Carrie is coming over tonight to cook for me, so I might invite some people over for a dinner party or something....  jaMEs
