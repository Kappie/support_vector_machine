So i would like to say thanx to the people that make this blog have a purpose like, Harry, Shelby, Jenny, and Sircomplainsalot. You are the only people that read this and if you dont....you should. You can here about the crazy antics that happen in my life during november of 2003. Such as...me and harrison having a party at midnight to celebrate the new day. Or Shelby liking 30 different people during the month (1 per day). And me.....Posting a blog. Only these are a few great things that happen on anime geek's blog. So i encourage you to not touch that back button becuz there is more to come. (this is not my last post!!!!!) Regards, Anime Geek  Ps. I've posted 24 posts so far
