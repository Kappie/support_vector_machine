I really don’t think I am a person with interesting ideas as much as they are unique.  I am starting this blog mainly to keep up with my day to day happenings as a memory tool kind of.  Just something so I don’t forget my entire life.  I could care less if anyone ever reads this.  Truly my life is not all that entertaining so anybody who does read my blog will probably fall asleep.  I’ve often tried to keep Journals in the past.  They either get lost or destroyed.  Sometimes they would go months or yeas without being written in.  I am going to try to continue posting using the blog, but if I don’t.  I’m sure it will just be another thing that will be lost in time.
