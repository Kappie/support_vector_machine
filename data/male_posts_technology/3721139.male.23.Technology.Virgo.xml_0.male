On Saturday, though, I'm taking some friends to Austin for day of climbing at Reimer's Ranch, and swimming in the Pendernales.  The tree swing is awesome.  It'll be a great way to cool off in the afternoon when the sun is directly overhead.  I get to play climbing teacher again, but that doesn't bother me too much - I'm hoping to grow my pool of available climbing partners so that one day I can actually start progressing in the sport again.  I can't wait for  urlLink Misty  to get her harness off the slow boat from China.  She's got quite the body for climbing.    The rain's supposed to have stopped dumping in Austin this afternoon, so I'm sure it'll dry out quickly, but damn have we had a lot of rain.  Don't get me wrong, I love the rain (and I'm not ready for the blistering days of summer, thankyouverymuch), so I don't want it to go, but I also don't want it to come around so much.  On a whim, I tuned into an internet radio station streaming punk.  See, I usually listen to trance/techno/house, as do most of the people I know who write software for a living (commentary on  that  vocational adaptation I'll leave for another post), so it follows that I wasn't programming this afternoon...  and we'll leave it at that.    I ought to end this post right now, but the reggae station, "playin' mostly marley mon'", was definitely worth a mention.
