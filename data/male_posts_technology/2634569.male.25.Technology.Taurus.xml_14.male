My experiences fewer and fewer cuz I'm too afraid to fall Why is that? Countless nights and weekends are spent just home alone Why is that? Rumaging through the numbers of my un-used telephone When out with friends and mates I have nothing at all to say Why is that? Yet the pages of this journal grow fuller and fuller each day So many dreams and aspirations, yet all I do is sit Why is that? I'll tell you in 2 words simply, it's cuz I'm Chicken Shit!
