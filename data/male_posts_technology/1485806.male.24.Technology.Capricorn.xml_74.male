Early morning woken up for morning jogs and boy there was huge group of us and then bathed and then go for COLT(CLIT) Core Leader Intern Training in which i have attended for the 5th time and still i can't get enough of it . Of course hanging out with new upcoming leaders of Simply United is a joy ...rather than just hanging out with Siew Ching and Dan all the time...not that i am complaining especially with Siew Ching. Then went to SIB PJ for the 1st time to witness Ivan and Weng Onn for baptism. ANd then went back to church to prepare the team for the launching of   COUZ Camp : Leaving your skins behind ...............with our humongous booth with trees , lights and lots of decoration. Pictures of it i shall add to this blog later cause the pics from this booth rite to the application form is unique ...Incidentally the Application form is also the T-Shirt Design. For RM99 , you get 4 days 3 night in Jungle Lodge which is very cool. T- Shirt as well. We are going to print more T-Shirts as the design is so cool that ppl who planning not to attend also would want to buy one.  For some the question of life does not come to them ...instead the question of sacredness of marriage comes into mind ..as evidenced in Wan Phing 's blog...  urlLink Wan Phing  and the culture sets in OZ, australlia thru a conversation with an old SIB Youth Dinosaur ...who is SIR7  urlLink  SIr7  who actually comes out with interesting stats.  I just received an old frens ' resume to pass on to my company and boy she have an interesting and impressive resume.Imagine at 23 years old, she have a master degree in SOftware Engineering and yeah she is super cool girl....and chun too...hehe./  ahh..the gift of life from God is simply wonderful and the upcoming challenges that is coming...i am both excited and bewildered because i wonder what lesson can i get from all this...
