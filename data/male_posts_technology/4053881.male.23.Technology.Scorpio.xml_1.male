I wonder whylife issoo complicated and yet in the same time soo simple. It seems that life cannot exist without an opposite and that everything is govern through the laws of irony.   People say that you stay healthy by going to the gym...well you know what, the gym can be a hazardous place to go to. Let me tell you about a lil' adventure/drama story that happened.   Once upon a time, in a galaxy not so far away,  ...as i go to the gym(YMCA), i pick up my lil MD player, put on some trance music to do some cardio. As i mount on topof the power 5000-elliptical machine and engage a hard training session - meaning i rise my heart level to 190 - just as a reference, kids under 12 have the highest heart rate functioning normally and it usually goes to 180. so going back to my story, as i stop suddenly, which is bad cause normally you have to "cool down" and i though, what the heck, i can take it...so i go drink some water... and since while you drink you can't breathe, well a lack of oxygen was created.  geez, the spasm i felt, ohh the pain...i felt like i was going to puke my insides out, asif my guts wanted to get out. Then i started to walk towards the window cause i see some mats and some seats. I figure sitting would be a good idea. so as i sit, i start seeing dark spots, and i start loosing my hearing...yes that's right...i'm starting to faint..so as i fall on the mat, feeling like Rocky Balboa in the 1st movie, "MIIIICKEYYY arrrrrhhhhhhhhhh!" i start yelling...well ok it was more like whining..but still i yelled forHELP!!! so i see all these people running around, doing their exercise and looking at me...and as i go down..not a single person came tosee me....here is a dramatization of what happen, well just the dialogue part.   Me in a faint voice: HELP!!!!  Guy walking : oh look, he's recuperating from an exhaustive exercise.  Guy walking next to him: ah yes, isn't the gym a great place to exercise, look at that guy resting and feeling in top shape. he looks like he's breething deeply and doing yoga.  Guy walking: i should start, it looks kind of fun  Me: Heeeelll....  suddently, i fall down and unconscious.  Me 15min later....  as i open my eyes, i look at my watch...oh look, i'm somewhere and i don't know what just happened except that i remember yelling for help....  so as you can see...what if i would be dying..would people just walk by and look at me and compliment me on my new form of Yoga...i mean..has the world gone insane and think that people trying to make weird faces are due to different exercises....  but that happened a couple of weeks ago...  not too long ago..*coughs yesterday  i was in the gym and as i go check the machines' reservation sheet, they were all taken. so i figure ok...maybe someone didn't go and i can go on it...so as i check, aha...one machine available..so i go, cross out the name that reserved it and put in my name..so it has been said from the YMCA that if you're late for your reserved machine, you lose your spot.  so as i exercise for my 1st 10minutes, a girl approaches meand says:   Girl: hey did you reserve that machine, cause i reserved it and you're on it...  giving a fearsome stare that shouts, if you say something i'llbite your heard offand spit you out in less than 5 seconds. and before i could say something....  Girl: someone crossed my name out and it wasn't me!  probably thinking, it was you you F***ing guy i should kill you on the spot.  Me: but you were late, so it was free and i took the machine...  the Girl was giving me this look..  me: you know what, there are plenty of machines available...gimme a second....  as i walk off to see the sheets, i see my name cross out, then i see her initials on 1 block only.....so she was late, crossed out my name from the 30minutes i reserved the machine and put her name for 10min, and as i look around, i see 2 machines that are free...  so instead of arguing and letting the world know about the biggest BI*CH on the world. i decided that i was a pacifist, so i just jot my name on the other machine.  me: you know what..whatever just take the machine....  so i just avoided a meaningless fight....and they call this place a YMCA...what does it stands for again... young man christian association !!! i don't think sooo...what's soo christian about that...PERSECUTION!!!!! can't a guy just work out PEACEFULLY!!!...   So you see, psychological violence is very present even in your YMCA....as for physical...geez....try reserving a machine during those peak hours...it's like frekin' bee hive...there are soo many people and they get medieval on your a** you you "steal" THEIR machine..and god knows how much i want to pick up a fight with a guy named Tiny or Bubba with 3 times my size..or should i say my torse is as big as his biceps... :S   then i realized how much of a twig i was...
