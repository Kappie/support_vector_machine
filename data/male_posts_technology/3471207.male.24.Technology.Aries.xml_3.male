Funny thing is, he's a gay but he's quite serious when he talks with you. We've (primary sch classmates) have tried talking him out of it but he said he can't change. I dont' really believe that people can't change their inclinations. It's like telling a smoker "hey you can't quit smoking coz you're born like that" or telling an alcoholic the same thing. I'm just sad for him that he's become like that and that his life is quite messed up judging by the fact that he hasn't found a fixed job all this while when he came out from school. Then i learnt he's going to be working in this new clubhouse and ask me to have our class gathering there next time. Yeah it's been quite some time since we had a gathering. I think the recent one was 2 or 3 yrs back. We have this yahoogroups thingy where we can mass mail to our pri sch classmates. What happened was i got an alert mail from yahoo that our account will be deleted as there were no messages that were posted in the past 90 days unless someone posted a message. Well, i decided to take the chance and do some "catching up" shall i say and updating of myself. Lo and behold, some of my ol friends replied back with their updates. It's really amazing when you think of it. It's been like 13 years since we finished primary school and there's something that keeps us together and i thank God for that. Friends are important in your life.  Another thing for today is..i'm still doing the jurong church website!!! AHHHHH..needed time to integrate the forum  to the site. And finally i knew a better way of doing it and it works now. The events calendar is done too. So now i'll have to finish off with the sermon listing and to split them up into quarters of the year.(1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)..that's what i'm going to do next and i think it's quite fun too doing all this because you know you are in control!! Once again, the POWER..but then it's a different kind of power..haha...  Had bible study with andrew last night. We went through some stuff about how to make the most out of your own personal bible study. There were things in there that i knew for the first time. And i thought andrew was lucky to know all that at his age..haha. Well, bible study has been going on smoothly. He's been going on fine too. His exams are coming up in july but he doesn't mind continuing to meet up each week. Some people are just so smart. Yeah, i'm already thinking of what lessons to give after i finish those Discover bible guides. (finished 15 out of 26)...suddenly the "feeling" overwhelms me because i, being the teacher can teach him anything i want. Maybe i'll tell him more about ellen white after that or maybe teach him some christian apologetics or maybe some other stuff. The resources are endless!! And once again...the POWER!!!  Oh yeah, my friend who was visiting Jordan suddenly msned me. She was wondering how come i was up so early.(7pm) I was like, "yeah i just woke up"..i think she forgot that she's no longer in US where there's a 12 hour difference. It was about 2pm when she messaged me so probably she thought it was 2am here. Oh well, i got scolded for not reading her LONG letter..hahhaa....reading that made me so envious of her coz she said she's going to visit the pyramids of Giza and Valley of the Kings AND climb Mount Sinai and get this....swim in the dead sea!! AHHHHHHH it's not fair!!!!! ANyway i hope i can earn big cash so i can do what i want in terms of travel..gotta get that POWER!!!!
