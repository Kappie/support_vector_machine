This isn't another J2EE/WebSphere/Oracle yada yada yada project. This is hard core, shrink-wrapped software, for a company that has substantial revenues and has been in business for more than five years.  I'm going to be candid with you: this company is investing in Agile, is giving agile a try, but needs to see results. We've already hired two strong agile development leads, and we're gaining traction with the CEO and VP of Product Management.  We've got the support and we're already doing a lot of new development using agile practices. Now we need to deliver. And that means we're looking for two things: (1) people who deliver (Joel calls this skill "Gets Things Done"), and (2) people who are strongly committed to agile development.  I'm stressing this point for a reason. There are a lot of people who "like" agile, who "think its cool." We aren't looking for them. If you believe that agile's nice, but not essential, PLEASE pass this email to someone who's a little more passionate about delivering software.  We're looking for the few, the proud, the fanatics. People who know that the old ways deliver half as much software in twice the time, if they deliver at all. And specifically, people who care enough that they're uncomfortable delivering less than their best.  It's really simple. We're delivering great software, ahead of the curve, using agile practices. Our success is going to drive the company to the next level. We have an ambitious plan. And now we need to bring in the talent to deliver the products while evangelizing the entire company.  SO: if you're a "God amongst insects" when it comes to C++ development, if you have incredibly strong communication and leadership skills, if you want to be a part of the agile revolution, email your resume to me RIGHT NOW. I'm ready to arrange interviews.
