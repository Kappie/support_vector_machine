Probably won't find out results until my doctor's appointment on the 21st. At least I hope I don't have to find out until then--the old no news is good news.   Spent rest of day shopping in Kona (again). Ran into Jill again, this time in Wal Mart. We bought green curtains and a couple of curtain rods. Got home and May wasn't happy with the mismatch in greens between the curtains and couch. I thought it was nice that the two greens were different. She wants to replace the curtains with a lighter sage green.
