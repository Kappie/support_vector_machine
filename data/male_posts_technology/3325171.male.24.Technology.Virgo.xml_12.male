While most garden gnomes fish or enact scenes of bucolic tranquillity, ex-army sergeant Tony Watson's models in Barnsley, South Yorkhire, bared their breasts and buttocks, prompting complaints from the public.  "It is an offence to display something that is insulting or likely to cause distress," a police spokeswoman said on Wednesday.  "Although some people view the gnomes as a bit of harmless fun, we have to take complaints from members of the public seriously."  One of the gnomes now sports a polka-dot bikini, said local resident John Threlkeld, who passes the gnomes every day on his way to work.  "Tony used filler and paint to cover them up," he said.
