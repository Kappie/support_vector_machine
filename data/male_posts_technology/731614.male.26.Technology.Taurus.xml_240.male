Unlike most organizations, the housemates are not necessarily like-minded individuals and where they might ignore one individual’s blog, the mandatory participation insures blah blah blah blah….  HAHAHAHA!!!  I was just talking shit.  I only joined to meet Belle.  Joining the house has been much like accidentally falling into a swimming pool fully clothed at a public event.  Initially embarrassing, and your money’s no good.  But also somewhat invigorating and often refreshing, depending on the weather.   The RWBS has enriched my life far more than a job ever could.
