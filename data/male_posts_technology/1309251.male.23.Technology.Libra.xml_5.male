His tone  began to come down.He said ,he has a shortage of engineers and I need to fill the space.I couldn' t say no.I asked him the time at which ,I had to be there in CMS (he said he wants me at 9.30AM).I don't care a shit about this guy ,because ,I have to cook food and get out of the house.  I reached CMS on Saturday ,at 11.00 AM.Last time ,he said ,he doesn't want to hear my personal execuses.This time ,he asked me why i was late again.I said ,"sir,I don't want to bore you with my personal execuses ,and we could get on with the call".I got the place where ,I was to take charge from another guy in CP.  I reached JantarMantar and walked till Barakhamba to Gopaldas building.It wasn't too bad just 2 KMS.On reaching ,I had to wait for minutes just to board the lift and found IGL at the 14th floor.The guy ,I had to help was a lean and lousy guy from Noida.We played pool in the computer and saw porn together. He said,the other engineer used t guide him through the web and even allowed chatting.I got bored seeing porn .  I reached home at 6.30PM and started cooking .I had my supper with TV,then,studied JSP and slept at 12.00 at night. On Sunday,washed the clothes in the washing machine and had my brunch.I just watched movies and read JSP simultaneously.I drank chilled milk in the evening and bought milk. I even switched on the motor for water.I didn't forget anything thoughout the two days . I drew 3000 rupees on Monday and reached metlife at 12.00.The administrator at metlife, Delhi called up and asked the sales co-ordinator when I come to metlife every day.She sees me only at 11.00AM so she said so.I called  Kuldeep and he asked me why I was coming so late?I said that I come nearly and around 10.00AM.He said ,that the office starts at 9.00AM and I should be at 9.00AM.I didn't tell him,according to the contract the timings are from 10.00AM to 12.00 noon and 4.00PM to 6.00PM. The guy is going to come today and I am going to feel hell today.This guy is a calm looking guy ,with an aggressive mouth.His mouth chews paan,bubble gum and spits words of insult.I have blisters in my mouth due to eating channa-batoora on saturday.These are the perks you get when you work for a lousy company like CMS.  I Hope my mistakes soon get reduced and I start towards something worth to work for and cherish the experience for the rest of my life.
