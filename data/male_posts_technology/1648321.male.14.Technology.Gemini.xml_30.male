I get to bring my PowerBook tomorrow to school because in Computer Proficiency we are doing an iMovie project, and it is due Thursday, but we are not going to finish in class, so I'll edit the movie on my PowerBook at home instead. (Of course it is fun to just have my PB at school for fun.) We do have a math test on Thursday (which I still need to study for). I hope I get a good score higher than a C+. The corrections for our math assignments are now online, so that helps a lot. Anyway, no homework in French today. Almost done with American History homework (pretty easy), and easy corrections for math. You probably now are almost falling asleep because of this boring school stuff, so I'll let you go nighty-night now because this post is over now.
