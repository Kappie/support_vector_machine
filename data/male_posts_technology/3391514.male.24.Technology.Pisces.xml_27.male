Almost nothing happened on Saturday anyway... Dawsons Creek ended, but I'm behind so I had to tape it.  As mentioned previously, it seems like all decent terrestrial TV is coming to an end, but thats the curse of summertime TV scheduling.  Only  Angel  and  Will and Grace  strive to keep me sane.  Made a character for a friends attempt at a dicelss roleplaying game.  Looks interesting enough, hopefully it will be.  Also discovered that I have a tendency to play suspicious and untrustworthy characters in particular cicles.  Quite true.  Played a little more  UFO: Aftermath .  Just got my hands on an FN-P90, so I'm somewhat pleased.  It appears human weapons are far more entertaining than the alien tech, as previously mentioned.  The only advantage alien guns have is range... they beat just about everything bar sniper rifles.  Finally, I got the forms relating to my financial worries, and appear to have been sent the wrong ones.  Thus it gets dragged on another week.  Ho hum.
