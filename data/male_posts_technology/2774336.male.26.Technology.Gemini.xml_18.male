 Mornings are clearly the best part of my day (if you can accept 11:30 as morning).  With no where pressing to go, I tend to wake slowly, warmly, tucked neatly under the blankets that have escaped being kicked to the floor.  While my intestines quietly gurgle, I toss and turn in an attempt to find that comfortable position that will send me back to sleep, but I rarely succeed. 

 Once conciousness has fully and finaly interupted what could have been my best day, I rise from bed too quickly and sway a bit as my head surrenders to being vertical again.  Like a timer set on the bomb in my stomach, I can count the seconds until the troubles begin.  There is usually enough time for me to make it up the stairs and into the shower, perhaps stoping for a small bite of bannana bread or sip of juice in the kitchen, before the belching starts. 

 As I stand in the shower, I wonder again why I wake every day with such a terrible taste in my mouth - regardless of what I had eaten before bed or how many times I had brushed my teeth.  I imagine the acid of my stomach, being freed somewhat from the gravity that imprisons it durring the day, creeping silently along my esophogus through the night to contribute that awful flavor to my otherwise blissful mornings.  I like to imagine that the piece of bread or several crackers I ingest after waking are a forcefull counter-strike to the acids night missions, but I know that it's a losing front.
