The time in which I could have built something useful not only to me but to others as well, the time in which I could have gained more knowledge, become wiser and moved onto the next level of enlightenment (I assume realizing this is the first one). During one of my frantic and desperate searches to do something worthwhile, I came across this really great statement by  Scott Stark, CTO of  JBOSS  . The link is -  urlLink http://jboss.org/community/overview    For those who have no clue of what Open Source is, read this you might end up being one of the super stars that Scott talks about.  JBOSS is an open source Java application server, I was looking for ways as to how contribute to it. This article is a must read for any programmer who has ever thought of contributing to open source.
