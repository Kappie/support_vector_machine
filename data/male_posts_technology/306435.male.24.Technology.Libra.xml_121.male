They have a nice apartment and live in the same complex woth Justin.  We also had Dewey's pizza.  I  packed all my stuff up that night and then they helped me move on Thursday.  Along with Elise, Bethy and Matt.  Bethy made us dinner which was good.  Friday, I cleaned out the Ivanhoe apartment with Justin.  Then Ann and I  went to Amol (our favorite Indian restaurant).  Saturday I had my baseball game.  The game was horrible.  I pitched.  I wih I had a defense.  Really I do.  There were about 6 or 7 pop ups to the out field that should have been caught.  When I say should have been caught I am not counting balls in the gap...I mean regular fly balls with the outfielder planted under them.  My arm felt great until a 60 pitch third inning.  I through six innings.  In the sixth General tried to pull me after the left fielder horribly misplayed a flyball.  Here is the conversation:  General: "Steve how is your arm feeling?" Ryan: "NO!" Steve: "Good." Ryan: "NO!" General: "Ryan are you sure?" Ryan: "You are not gong to pull me from the game because the left fielder cannot catch a fly ball!"  So I stayed in the rest of the inning.  I hate losing, but I hate losing even more when people don't know how to play baseball.  It is like I am in Little League again!  Ann came to the game and from the way she talked I think she is starting to enjoy them.  She didn't bring a book this time. After the game we went to my apartment so I could change and Tom was working on putting together a desk he bought.  We then went to a Thai restaurant called the Bankok Bistro.  It was good and very spicey.  Ann got sushi and I got a shrimp pasta.   Sunday i drove Ann and the last of her stuff near Purdue in Indiana and met up with her sister Mary.  It sucks that we will be so far away from each otherr for a long time.  I am confident though that I will be able to find ways to go see her.   When I got back to Cincy, after three hours of the loneliest stretch of Indiana highway, I hung out with Tom and Justin at the apartment.  We watched the basketball game...  That was my week... by wednesday I will be bale to update the rest of the page.
