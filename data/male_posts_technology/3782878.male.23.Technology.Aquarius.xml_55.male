That same even Ice Dragon who I spoke of recently. I decided to attend, despite the fact that Akcron could not attend. I was more than a little worried that without my cleric, I may be doomed to die. This would turn out to be a logical fear.  When I arrived, Kretais and Ellektra were already there, and Konath was on his way. I nearly died getting lost in the ice goblins lair. But I made it and healed up. While we were plotting and waiting for more to attend our Raid, some foolish warrior probably went in to peek and see if Lady Vox was even home. Well she was, and immediately set to killing everyone, I screamed in terror, which is very unlike me and ran away, she must have put a spell on most of us, for a majority of us were running away.I died when I came back to assist those still living to kill her. Unfortunately it was I who died in doing so.   Luckily we had a ton of clerics on hand and a person there specifically for dragging bodies, we got resurrected, and continued our plans. Unfortunately one of our elder saviors had a pet who had found lady vox and was attacking her, while she was caught on the walls of her lair. I sat down seeing as there was no sign that Vox would be back to kill me again in a while, and I was recovering from the resurrection.  That's when it happened, while I was sitting an a ridge, I get knocked in the side and stand up, look over and there's lady Vox again, looking very upset at me, so I run, with the rest of the crew hoping to find safety as I was the youngest of the adventurers there. when I got into a corner, she stopped hitting me, and I felt reasonably safe that someone else was now keeping Lady Vox's attention. This was not the case, because as soon as I rounded the corner, I was slain by her again.   I got another Resurrection, and finally, we began to organize the raid, and our leader of this charge gave us all instructions, and he was a fine leader, for he knew exactly what we would need to survive, and how quickly things must be done. Unfortunately the elder's were casting spells that only people who have been around for 46 seasons or more could receive. I had not yet hit that mark, and thus I was nearly naked of enhancement. I got some dexterity from Kretais and I used my own paladin enhancements, but they pale in comparison to clerical enhancements. Luckily during the assualt on Vox, I did not die. She did manage to incite fear in me once, but I returned quickly and aided in the elimination of her.   The sad thing is, she did not drop the book that I had been looking for. However I did meet a man who claims he has several books from her, and will give me one when I am ready. I wrote down his name to not forget it, and will contact him when I have the other pieces of the book of scale. We all took sketches of us standing in front of lady vox's corpse, and it was a good day.   I took a teleport with a druid to the nexus and made camp in the Plane of Knowledge as I like to do. it was a great adventure, I just wish I could've claimed the book as my own. Perhaps Nagafen or the dragon of Skyfire might be more inclined to drop their half of my book.  If ever shall we meet may it be as brothers, and not as enemies, Ziggur Rathebringer
