Bill sponsors said their concerns  about Saudi's commitment to fighting terrorism "were exacerbated  yesterday when a suspected al-Qaeda loyalist, Khalid bin Odeh bin  Mohammed al-Harbi, surrendered to Saudi authorities under the kingdom's  month long amnesty offer to wanted militants and made comments  expressing his relief at being under the control of Saudi authorities."  Said Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-NY): "Time and again, the Saudis have shown  that they are not our allies in the war on terror."
