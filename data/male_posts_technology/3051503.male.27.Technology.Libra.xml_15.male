No wonder as they say lesser mortals think a lot...  So here we break the jinx.I have collected some info and links to  some sites that will make you understand the whole crux of the RSS technology.     What is RSS?     RSS (Rich Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication ) is a format for delivering summaries of regularly changing web content. Many news-related sites, weblogs and other online publishers syndicate their content as an RSS Feed to whoever wants it. usually it located  by a simple XML  sign board .  If you frequent Weblogs, you've seen the little XML icons inviting you to "syndicate this site", but what does that really mean?   A long time ago, newspaper managers realized that if they could use articles and stories from other newspapers in their paper, they could garner more readers because they could cover a wider area than they could with just their own reporters.  This is an example of how syndication can work in print.  Online, there are potentially millions of authors writing about millions of topics each day. It can be very difficult to keep track of without some type of automated system.  And that's where RSS comes in. Really Simple Syndication (RSS) is an easy way for Web sites to share headlines and stories from other sites. Web surfers can use sophisticated news readers to surf these headlines using RSS aggregators.     Why RSS? Benefits and Reasons for using RSS ?      RSS solves a problem for people who regularly use the web. It allows you to easily stay informed by retrieving summaries of the latest content from the sites you are interested in. You save time by not needing to visit each site individually. You ensure your privacy, by not needing to join each site's email newsletter.
