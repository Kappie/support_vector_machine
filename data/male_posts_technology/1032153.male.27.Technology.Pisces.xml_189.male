She said that homosexuality has always been around and we need to have a tolerant, accepting and inclusive view on the matter.  It seems the PM has forgotten her comments in an interview with the “Express Newspaper’ in February. When answering a question regarding the supposed levels of homophobia shown by ‘religious groups’, she is recorded in print as follows. ‘It’s a very small minority point of view and I think through continuing to set the tone of tolerance, acceptance and diversity you just have to further marginalise such people. Hopefully one day nobody will think that way’.  The PM’s answer is both instructive and hypocritical. It is all right to marginalise a position you don’t agree with when you are in power. Tolerance, acceptance and diversity are defined and have meaning only in terms of the government’s agenda. We must demonstrate tolerance and inclusiveness towards homosexuals but apparently this does not extend to those of us who along with the God of the Bible say that the practice of homosexual behaviour is a sin.
