Paid my arrears, collected my jo, and even managed to get some short clips of Hattori Sensei teaching the dojo. It was a waste that I didn't manage to get the part of him showing some weapons technique to the dojo. He was trying to relate the empty handed forms with the swordwork. It was truly interesting.  I found a lot of people have improved tremendously. They've adopted a very style which seemed quite common in some of them, and yet still still makes themselves stand apart from the rest. I'm not saying they're very great or anything but I was pleasantly surprised with the improvements in the past 12 mths or so.  Just which I had made that kind of progress when I was in UK. Just makes me want to train harder. I haven't started my bokken exercises since landing in S'pore. Think I'll start real soon. Once things get settled, I may ask Ah Hee Sensei if he still conducts weapons classes. Would be really happy to be able to supplement my taijutsu with weapons.
