The storm is supposedly weakening already but the downside is that it's huge and is supposed to make landfall right around Morehead City, Beaufort, and Atlantic Beach.  One of my favorite fishing destinations, Harkers Island, is right up the road from there...I hope the  Pasfield's stay high and dry down at the Harkers Island Fishing Center.  Somebody better be looking after that crazy guy who builds model boats in the house next to the marina as well. We'll probably get nothing but a bunch of rain and moderate wind out of the whole thing here in Winston Salem.    Last night I helped a friend move the timbers from an old fallen-in kitchen behind his "new" turn of the century house.  He had to get the rubble cleaned up becuase his insurance company was threatening to cancel his homeowners insurance policy if he didn't.  Some of those timbers must have weighed 400 pounds, my friend fell while carrying one of them and messed his knee up.  When it happened I was afraid he broke his leg and the bone was gonna be all sticking out of the skin or something.  My reward for helping was beer and mexican food after it got too dark to continue.   Good times.  My name will be in the Wall Street Journal today.  Apparently the Babcock school takes out an ad and prints a graduation announcement for my class.  Cool, huh.
