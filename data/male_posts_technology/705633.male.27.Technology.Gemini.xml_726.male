For the most flavourful cup, we recommend 10 grams of coffee for every 180 millilitres of water. If coffee brewed this way is too strong for your taste, you can add a little hot water to your cup of brewed coffee.    (10 grams coffee : 180 millilitres of water)     Grind   Different brewing methods have different grind requirements, but in general – the shorter the brew time, the finer the grind. For example, coffee ground for an espresso machine should be very fine, because the brew cycle is only 18-23 seconds long. But for a coffee press (cafetiere), the coffee should be ground coarsely, because the water and coffee are left to sleep for four minutes before the plunger is slowly pressed down.    Espresso machines: Fine grind  Drip coffee makers: Medium grind  Coffee press: Coarse grind     Water   A cup of coffee is 98 percent water. So the water you use to make coffee should taste clean, fresh, and free of impurities. Water heated to just off the boil (90° to 96° C) is perfect for extracting the coffee’s full range of flavours. Any cooler and the water can't adequately do the job.    Clean water = Better coffee     Freshness   Coffee is fresh produce, and its enemies are oxygen, light, heat, and moisture. To keep coffee fresh, store it in an opaque, airtight container at room temperature in the dark. You can store it that way for up to a week. For the best results, coffee should be ground just before brewing.    Fresh coffee = Less than one week old
