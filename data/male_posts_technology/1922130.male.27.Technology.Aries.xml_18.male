Big Al and I ventured to  urlLink Carrboro  on 1/10/04 to see Matt wow a coffeeshop full of hippies and friends at the  urlLink Open Eye Cafe .  He did a couple of well chosen covers and put on a good show.  Much to his dismay, the  urlLink Titans  lost to  urlLink Indy  in the playoffs that same night.     Next, Tommy, Jackie, Marty, Big Al and I decided to go see a couple of country bands on 1/16/04.  We took in  urlLink The Rounders  and  urlLink Cash Monies and the Jetsetter  at  urlLink The Garage .  The Rounders are from somewhere in eastern Tennessee and were awesome.  They kind of have a rockabilly thing going and they look like something straight out of  urlLink Deliverance .  Great stage presence and good chops.  We bought a CD and had it autographed.  My favorite thing about the liner notes is that the bass players list of contributions includes "dog house bass" and "yells."  He was a true showman.  Check those guys out if you get the chance.  Cash Monies and company were from Boston and you could tell.  Country bands should not be from Boston.  I think they were actually embarrassed to have to follow an act like The Rounders.  They were okay, don't get me wrong, but they didn't stack up compared to their opening band.    We left early.  It was my first time at The Garage.  I'd heard lots of good things about the place and it seemed like a cool venue, but it was empty.  The guy who runs the place, Richard, said that it was because the bands were from out of town.  I'm not so sure.  I'll definitely add it to my list of happenin places in urlLink  W-S .  Finally Ali and I went to see  urlLink The Blue Dogs  at  urlLink Rubber Soul  on 1/24/04.  The Blue Dogs are now my favorite band ever.  Seriously.  They were great.  If I am ever fortunate to start another band (don't ask.....high school) I will model my band after the Blue Dogs.  They do bluegrass.  They do americana.   They do funk.  They do country and a whole lot more.  AND they make you laugh while they're at it.  AND all their songs sound more authentic than anything I've heard in a long time....even their covers.....nuff said.
