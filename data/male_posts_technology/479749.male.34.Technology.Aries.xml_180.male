Workout: 5 min Stationary bike 10 bicep curls 10 triceps pull downs 10 Sit-ups 10 bicep curls 10 triceps pull downs 10 Sit-ups 10 bicep curls 10 triceps pull downs 1 'huge set' of 5 crunches 5 leg lifts 5 crunches 5 leg lifts 5 crunches 5 leg lifts 20 min treadmill  Post Workout Notes: Arms are bugging me a bit. Especially my left shoulder but that's my weak side anyway. I got a little lightheaded after getting off the treadmill but that could be me just being tired from the lack of sleep.   Also I switch my workout shoes from my  urlLink Nike  walkers to a pair of  urlLink Reebok  hightops. The hightops helped with supporting my ankles as I walked on the treadmill but the DMX Light cushioning in the sole of the shoe gave me this strange feedback. Almost like walking on a pillow that wasn't helping the lightheadedness if I was really having any.
