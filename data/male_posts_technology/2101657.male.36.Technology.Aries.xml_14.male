But, the work day is done, on to home.    Been playing Unreal Tournament 2003 since last Wednesday.  I had issues trying to get it to run on my system, a 1.5ghz+, 256megs of memory, and a GeForce2 GTS video card with 32megs of ddr ram. The darn thing should of run.  Well, I've put in a Radeon 9600 Pro.  It handles UT2k3 bigtime now. The video quality, the frame rates, the speed.  Wow... I don't miss the GeForce2 card at all.  At least I got this right.  Well.....Christmas is just around the corner.  Three days to go now and counting.  It's a Happy, Cheerful time of year.  At least I think it is......
