I'd posted a message on his forums asking for the epilogue to the show and I got it this morning in an email:   Responding to life's changes is never easy. We have this idea about how we want our lives to go -- as if we really have control of what's coming down the pike. We tend to look at sudden change as setbacks because it wasn't what we had in mind. We want change as long as everything remains the same. We complain that we're not getting where we want to go, but have no intention of leaving where we are.  And yet our very purpose here is to grow and effect change. Life hands us opportunity every day to make a difference. When we dismiss those opportunities - usually because of fear of the unknown - we feel hollow. That empty feeling turns to anger and before we know it, it's everybody else's fault that we're not moving forward, having the life we think we deserve.  Life can be so rewarding but let's not confuse "reward" with "comfort". Change is often uncomfortable but necessary to helping us re-prioritize, re-commit and redefine who we've been to leave room for the extraordinary life we thought we'd never get. Make change! You can do it!  That's pretty damn inspiring.  And true, to boot.
