Going to go visit Bryce tomorrow, Figure I'll leave sometime in the morning and just head straight to Waterloo.  Not even going to tell stoopid bitch because I really don't want to see her.  I just want to see Bryce.  I'll probably go back the same day since Sam is going to some retarded cult camp.  Fuck that shit.  That's all I got planned for this weekend.  Next weekend though is bachelor party weekend.  Yay.  Too bad it's Black Arrow Weekend as well.  Oh well, I guess I would rather hang out with my MI buddies than play video games all weekend.  Although I will probably play mad football at Ted's house when I get there Friday night.  I don't think we can make it to Lansing in time.  So anyone out there willing to go to a wedding on the 21st of August and 4th of September with me?  Friday Frag Fest is upon us.  too bad I was a little late therefore I will e stuck here at work till about 6-6:15PM  Damnit.  It also sucks that I will have to get reprimanded because I had to take care of my fucking leaking room.  Ready to go at 6:30 and it's raining, ceiling starts to leak, had to go get pots and pans and was able to leave at 7.  But hey, still going to get written up for that shit.  Whatever.
