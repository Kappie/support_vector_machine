I ran a 30 today with 1 minute of pickup and a whole lot of hills.  I had to stop to walk twice for one minute each and one other time to fiddle with my stupid mp3 player (dang thing never worked right all morning).  Beyond that, my legs and everything felt great.  I am certain I will be a little sore after my 1 minute pickup today but probably not too  bad.  The arch supports seem to really be helping, hopefully.  ;)
