You look like you look for a reason. our God made no mistake. He knit you together within the womb, you're just what he wanted to make.  The parents you had were the ones he chose, and no matter how you may feel, They custom-designed with God's plan in mind, and they bear the master's seal  No, the trauma you faced was not easy. and God wept that it hurt you so; But it was allowed to shape your heart So that into his likeness you'd grow.  you are who you are for a reason, you've been formed by the master's rod you are who you are, beloved, because there is a GOD!
