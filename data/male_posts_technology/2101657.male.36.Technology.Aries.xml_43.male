I had 2 classes this term, (a B- and a B) which I've decided is almost too much to do at the same time as working a full-time job, being active in CubScouts as a Pack Leader/Den   Leader, and trying to help people with their home PC's. I've got to find out how to get my grades yet, as I'm eager to see what I ended up with. Plus, I'd like to get submitted for tuition reimbursement (money NEVER hurts).   It'll be nice to have my Monday/Thursday evenings open for the next couple of months for a change. The boys and I have really gotten into playing Disc Golf©. We have a really awesome course here, just a hard one for beginners due to the EXTREAMLY number of trees lining the course. It's a very beautiful course, located by Veteran's Memorial Park on the west side of the park.  The oldest son and I went down Sunday at 1, as they had mentioned on the local Cable access channel that they would be having 2hrs of lessons, for $5/person with a disc included.  We were there, and the only other person to show up was the instructor.  They mentioned about pre-registering but I hadn't seen anything on the TV about that. They said we didn't have to pay but I still did, just to cover their time.  The guy who was teaching us REALLY knows his stuff, and is going to be playing at the World's in Des Moines, Iowa this August.  He's an Amateur in the PDGA, and said next year he'll probably go Pro.  That guy can really heave a disc.  On the 10th hole, which is 400ft, he JUST missed the basket, and that was with just 1 throw. He was able to tell after seeing me throw 2x, that I used to play tons of Frisbee when I was a kid/teen.  I have to remember to follow through with my throw, and also have my arm higher up when I throw, as I hold it too low.    He was saying that I should also use a power grip when I throw from the tee too, as the more power I throw it with, the more the disc will spin, and the further it will go.  After seeing the way this dude threw, I want to throw like that too.  He also showed me a handy throw, where I throw the disc side armed, and instead of pulling my arm all the way back like I'm going to throw a baseball, I just take it about half-way back, and snap my elbow forward, and give my hand a flick, and it will send the disc out straight, and then cause it to curve to the right. This kind of throw will be extremely handy on the 8th hole, where they turned it into a dog-leg.  Only thing is I need a new disc for it, as the only one I have that’s good for that throw I let my youngest son have.   We've just gotten into the sport really, this spring, and we already have 11 discs between us.  Course, this is nothing, as our instructor Sunday says he has about 200.  This guy knew all the stats on the discs that we had even, being able to tell us which ones were the better ones, their speed and turning ratios, everything. He was very impressive and I hope he does really well at the Worlds.   It goes on for 5 days, and there are 5 courses in  Des Moines with each player playing 1 course a day.    It was also very hot Sunday while we played.  It was 83° and humid, so when we got back to the car after playing 18 holes, I was soaked.  I got the boy and I some PowerAid to carry on the course, and we had that gone by the time were on the 15th.  We got back to the car, we had some water bottles that we had with ice in them, and they   were totally melted due to how hot the car got.  All I cared about was the fact that it felt ubber-cool as I poured half of it over my head.  Boy did that feel good!  After watching the Disc Golf© Dude throwing like he did, it makes me want to practice that much more so I can be a 10th of how good he is.
