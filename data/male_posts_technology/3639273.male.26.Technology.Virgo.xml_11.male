There is a tale a brave and lost  of those who thought and then forgot.  Of those who knew but never walked  Of those of watched and never talked  Of those who heard and never listened  Of those who cried, but never spoke.   There is a tale of those who knew  The answer shown upon their hearts.  There is a tale of people lost  Of deadned minds came with a cost.  Of people choice but never made  Commitment never stayed.   The Faithful and the Faithless  Shall be forever known that one is one  and one cannot be another and be the other one.
