It still sounds good and I can sorta remember some of the chords (yeah all three of them) but it's enought o strum on the guitar and kinda sound like I know what I am doing.  I then decided to play a little  urlLink Scar Tissue .  As you can see it's not really that hard but I gotta get the timing and the rythm right.  besides that I have been practicing a little  urlLink Fur Elise .  That's one too is also not too bad.  So besides learning to play guitar and reading a book, l think I'm doing good in nurturing this little kick (well I hope it lasts longer than a kick) that I am in.  Later tonight I plan on learning from the  urlLink "Idiot's Guide"   Well that's all I got for now.  Well besides the party that I will be having this Friday.  If anyone wants to stop by, it's all good.
