You see, the stairs upstairs are in my wife's office on the first floor, and there's no door except the door between her office and the kitchen. Closing that door keeps the cold air in and means we're only cooling the upstairs and her office instead of the whole house, so it actually, y'know, functions and stuff. Anyway. Since the litter box for our cats is upstairs, we need to make sure all the cats are upstairs before we close the door for the night. Typically the last thing we do as we're going upstairs is get the daily treats for the cats, so usually they rush upstairs without much trouble.  So last night, I got the treats, and was trying to convince cats to go upstairs, fairly unsuccessfully. Book in one hand, drink in another, cat treats in a third, and opening the door with my fourth hand, I was calling them, pushing them with feet, and trying to convince them that upstairs was really the best place to be. I started saying to myself "Y'know, this is almost as bad as herding cats!", but I stopped partway through.  *sighs*  The moral? Yes, you really do get desensitized to common sayings like that, until they just have no connection to their actual original meaning.
