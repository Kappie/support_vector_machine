Most importantly I want as much work done now as possible so that I can see more of Kai when she comes back :o)  Had a fantastic weekend with Kaia, Anne and Co... we even met up with Sam. He's just bought himself a dig camera and there are a  urlLink few photos  to see.  I'm going home and to bed so I'll post soon. -gede
