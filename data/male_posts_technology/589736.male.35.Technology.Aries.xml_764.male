She bears a resemblance to her brothers and sisters though her "gifts" are of a different nature.  She has red hair, eyes that go from blue to green to grey, petite and very pale, normally a somber look on her face.  She has three brothers and two sisters:  she is brooding and philosophical like Dream, understands the purpose and beauty of Death, shares the insanity of Delirium, has coldness and indifference like Desire and Destiny, envies Destruction for his ability to walk away.   When you first meet her, you would think she is her own nemesis.  She understands your grief and pain and you feel compelled to share and have her listen.  And she understands and you feel soothed.  Then she gives back your burdens to you but adds some and she grieves for you and all the others that she cannot help, but is immobile by her nature.   I take on the mantle of the last sibling.  Hello my brothers and sisters,  I am Despair.
