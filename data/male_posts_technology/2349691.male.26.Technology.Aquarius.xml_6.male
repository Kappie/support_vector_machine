Well, someone has to take rock music forward !!   Recently, I heard from his friend and secretary that he has suddenly regained interest in software building business and has started recruiting people. "Good for him", I said.   More recently, we all got a mail from him, asking to check out his latest rock recordings. Now what should I say ? Anyway check out  urlLink http://www.calliphonia.com . Mind you, the site may be down most of the time.
