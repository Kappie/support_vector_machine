Stupid me I went to sleep at 11:30 (after watching  urlLink The Daily Show !) The I woke up at 6ish, I don't know why! Around 7ish I went to get my Methadone, and got back about 9ish. I called this girl I knew to see what she was doin'. She came by about 11am, I eat lunch, and we took off to the mall(This was my first mall I have been to for almost 3 years). She went to  urlLink Hot Topic , and  urlLink Victoria Secret (I found out her secret! Her name was actually Victor!), and some other shops.... So about 3 hours later, we left and it was raining Cats, Dogs, and other small animals! We came back here, we grabbed some cd's , and had a nosh(I was hungry!), then took off to see her boyfirend in a town called Middletown, never been there before, it was nice I guess. Well we eat there, and I got French Toast with Challah Bread(Yum!). By now it's like almost 7 then we came back and dropped me off at about 8. When I got home there was a message from  urlLink Sass Staffing , and I got to do another reset for Lowes in the Water Filteration area. No biggie, my Dad and I did another store about 2 weeks ago, last time it took us 10.5 hours! Now that was a long day!  Well I am tring AGAIN to download a copy of Linux again.... This time I am trying  urlLink Knoppix , at this point I am 55% done. I started it last night about 8pm! I HATE FUCKING DIAL-UP!!! I HATE AOHELL MORE! Well it may be done tommrot.. So lets hope I can get it on my HP 4440 that I found in the trash! Yep I found a Hp, monitor, keyboard and speakers! Too bad the mouse was missing :( The system is a AMD333, and 64 megs... I need more memory!!! If someone is willing to "donate" some old SDRAM 66MHZ PLEASE!!! I can trade something if you want!!! E-mail me!  Well I am fucking tried I am gonna take my shower and go to sleep! I need to do my mothers job, and service Lowe's Seasonal Isle. But as usual my mother will tell me that I do not contribute to the household! Whatever...  Well I need to sleep!  Good-Bye and Good-Nite  [Clapping and Cheering wanting more as I leave the Blog]  hahaha Don't ask!  Lates!
