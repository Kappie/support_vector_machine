MARK tell me what to do, what is this place, what's it's purpose.  Can I still be part of this even though I have poor grammar and no handle of the english language.  I have run-on sentances and my wrists hurt, I think I have carpal tunnel.  I'm too young to have that aren't I?  Can you blame me for being angry, do you believe in dreams being broken on a silver platter of hope.
