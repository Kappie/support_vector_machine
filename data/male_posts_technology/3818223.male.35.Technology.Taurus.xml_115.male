A running joke was that boys always found  urlLink Scarlet Johansson  prettier than her ignored friend played by  urlLink Thora Birch , although I found Thora to be the more attractive.  A great entry into the genre of teenage angst movies, but for my money the topper is still  urlLink Heathers . - 3 out of 5 stars.   urlLink School of Rock  - cute and charming, but utterly safe.  Casting  urlLink Joan Cusack  as the principal was a brilliant move.  The movie also entertains the conceipt that 70's Rock was the best music ever made, which establishes  urlLink Jack Black 's generation (people tend to get locked into the music of their teen years).  - 2.5 out of 5 stars.
