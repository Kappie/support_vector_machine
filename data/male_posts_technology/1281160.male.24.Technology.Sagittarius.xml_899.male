Recently an online gaming site in US was threatened to pay a sum $50,000 for not bringing the site down. The Company discontented to the request. The site was brought down. Even the Department of IT security services is not able to trace out who is the root cause for the problem.  Microsoft has announced a Bonanza price of $5 Million to encourage King of hackers. Currently, Microsoft has planned to prize the hacker with $1 million who traces out  the culprit who is responsible for m32.redhot.hack virus in the coming 6 months.(I am happy the software giant can't able to trace out the same).  AOL is losing its customers day by day.  It has lost most of its customers to cheap dial-up providers. AOL is losing the battle on price. When you have Wal-Mart  offering service for $9.94 a month, AOL has a hurdle to clear at $23.95 a month.
