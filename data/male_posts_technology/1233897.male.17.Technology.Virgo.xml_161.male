I'm constructing some massive fireworks (some for the 4th, some for... other purposes). We’re prolly going to the Jesh’s house on the fourth and I might light some off there.   Tomorrow we’re getting an electric organ. :) For free… :)  Thursday night, Adrie, Melissa, Rachael and Josh are all coming to my youth group for a welcome home thingy for the newly-arrived-back Mexico team. Should be fun.
