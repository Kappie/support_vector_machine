Those with newer computers that have Pentium 4 or Athlon XP processors should get  urlLink this one .  Those with older cpus (Pentium 3 or Pentium 2's) should get  urlLink this version  (these cool builds are being done by  urlLink Moox ).  I think I would install the  urlLink official release  first, and then install the optimized version over top. Also, Mono (the opensource .NET replacement) came out in  urlLink Beta3  yesterday.  I haven't used it a lot yet, but between it and  urlLink Sharp Develop , things in the open-source C# and .net programming world are getting peachy.
