Unfortunately, I have to start work monday, which is simultaneously awesome and a bummer: awesome because I'll be getting money and I won't be broke, a bummer because I don't want to go to work.  But as much as I wish money would just pop out of my ears or something whenever I need it, it doesn't (nor does it pop out of my parents' pockets, ahem), so that leaves me to try and scrounge up my own cash. Bah.  Yesterday I read a memoir by Augusten Burroughs about the first sixteen years of his life and how he spent it living with a psychotic mother who then pawned him off on her crazy psychiatrist who ran a makeshift mental hospital from his beaten old victorian house, all the while engaging in an intense sexual relationship with a man more than twice his age.  The book is called  Running with Scissors , it's a good story and a quick read so I'd reccomend it (it's certainly one of the best memoirs that I've ever read, as the genre is by and large pretty boring and dry).  I also saw both Fahrenheit 9/11 and Spider-Man 2 recently (rather appropriately, I saw the former on July 4th!) and liked both of them.  Moore succeeds in making a really excellent propaganda film and luckily it's my propaganda so I'm happy to see it!  Although really, the important thing is that people go to see it and start actually  thinking  about the political situation rather than just blindly following or ignoring it all together, and I think Moore's film definitely does provoke thought.  The one problem I had with it is that I thought he critisized too many people, which I felt lessened the overall effectiveness of the film.  Focused critisizm is really important when making a statement, and it's one of the things that activists in general seem to have a hard time with (e.g., it can't just be anti-war, it has to be anti-war, anti-racism, anti-poverty, etc.). Spider-Man 2 was fun, just what I'd expect from the sequel to a movie based on a comic book.  Such has been my boring life of late.
