No sugar added and a foul aftertaste that REALLY lasts  Drinking:  Diet coke -with- lime. Tis good, try it.  Age seems to matter less, the older I get. Time seems to go quicker, the older I get. This stands to reason tho, and niether make me wonder anymore, I've sussed it out. I'm so brilliant, listen to my reasoned explanations, and be awestruck.  Age seems to matter less, the older I get.  As human beings with a lifespan in the vacinity of 100 odd years, give or take, we do the majority of our development both mentally and phsyically, but also emotionally and also the development of our character, in the first 15-20 years of our life. After that period of time, people dont -really- grow a lot, change a lot etc.. because from then on, its' pretty much a case of 'living' with what you've become.. its true, its even harder to alter yourself physically from then on, in regards to weightloss etc.. scientifically proven n stuff. I guess thats why, at 25, I'll happily in a day converse with people that are nearly 10 years younger than me, nearly 30 years older than me, and consider them all my peers.  I dont see someone 5 years younger as being naive because of their age, but instead reserve my judgement of naivity, for those that demonstrate themselves to be that way inclined. Likewise with respect, and judgements on intelligence. Older is not necessarily wiser, and nothing in fact, can be assumed about being older, except that you're...well.. older. Experience? well, no not really, I know some old people that have done sweet fuck all with their lives, and I know younger people, myself included, that have probably experienced a multitude of things that other people never will. In my case, some intentional, some not.  This is more evident on the internet, than possibly anywhere else, on line age truely has become largely irrelevent, I told someone today, that on text based chat, you come as close as you possibly can, to talking, spirit to spirit. Meh, thats a bit metaphysical, but hey. I hope you get the jist.  Time seems to go quicker, the older I get.  Well, this is far more logical , and far less deep, so far as explanations go... and indeed many of you would've long ago worked this out for yourself, but here goes: You have been alive for X years. The older you get, the smaller percentage of your time, a day/week/month becomes. For example, when you were 10 yrs old, a year was 10% of your life. And as such, seemed almost an eternity. When you're 30, the same period of time, a year, is 1/30th of your life, or 0.3% so of course its going to seem like a lot less time. 1 year at age 10, is about the same as 3 years, at age 30. Right. That was easy.  Religion.. it's the biggest business on the planet, a little less-so now than it used to be, but still a very major and very real percentage of people adhere to some religion or another. I've long said, that religion offers a direction, and something to believe in, for those that have not yet learnt to direct themselves, and believe in themselves, and while this is still true, I think religion these days is becomming more and more commercial.  One of the Tamaki brothers, the same family that have enjoyed roaring success in the tourism industry, is the figurehead for Destiny Church.. which, is becomming or has become, a political party.. So? well.. most churches take a collection, or fixed percentage of what each member earns, to keep the church running, churches financially are extremely wealthy, substantial swags of property across New Zealand are still owned by churches and church groups, now with churches having tv shows, radio shows, and things like tshirts, bumper stickers etc for sale, and indeed running for parliment, I just have to wonder where it will all stop - or if it will, ever? I guess it probably wont.. maybe I'm just jealous, it'd be extremely lucrative to start a cult... maybe thats something I'll think about a bit more. Which of you can chant loudly? ;) Most people I've seen that work within the church, drive late model european cars, wear really nice suits, and have an abundance of jewellery.. religion, it seems , pays very well. Who wouldnt love to work half a day, and have a house and car paid for, by the church? I say we all move to our own 'craggy islands' and become priests. The bonuses don't stop there folks! there's also as many alter boys as you could ever want :) j/k Religions aside, I remember a guy from World Vision coming to my primary school to show us a video about starving kids, to promote the famine. He arrived in a mercedes, and had a nice projector, and a professionally edited sales-pitch video. Where'd that money come from? and how much of my famine money actually got to the kids? Sometimes ignorance is bliss.  Innovation. I'm looking at constructing for the purpose of reselling, a small computer that will run in a car, power up instantly, house the biggest of mp3 collections, play dvd's, divx and all your silly little animations, have mapping software, facility for gps navigation, engine management, hell - the possibilities are limitless.. 7" lcd touchscreen, with a fancy 'flash' based website interface, lots of fancy pictures, colour, and graphics galore. You'll love it. A top of the line headunit for a car is over a grand.. actually for around a grand you'll get a fairly decent one, if you want one that has a big screen and plays dvds etc, you can kiss the best part of $1500 goodbye. Mine? mine will be under a grand. More interested now? What if you could irc from it? ahhh now you're interested! geeks. I'll keep you posted, gotta go cook the bacon cabonara to go with tonights sausage casserole. Ka Kite.
