If you missed it, they scrolled the pictures of the fallen soldiers while "Arpeggio for Strings" (theme from the movie "Platoon") in the background.  No reading of names, no commentary....just the pictures and the haunting theme from "Platoon".  It was a poignant tribute appropriate for Memorial Day.
