But the agency needed a second contact by today.  They asked if I knew of anyone else who could be a reference to me.  I said, I could try locating one of my old managers.  I only worked at two other places, but one of the companies went out of business and I worked at the other company a long time ago.  It was hard to locate anyone.  I tried the white pages and the internet.  Luckily, my reference called them back today.  Therefore the temp agency called me back saying that everything is okay and that I can keep my job.  I visited Hyde Park today because Joan was there.  She had to straighten out some administrative things with her school.  So we walked around campus for a while.  I updated my sister's website too.  I didn't have any of the font's that she suggested, but I found a new one that I think works really well for it.  Now we just need some content.
