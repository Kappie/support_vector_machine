They got a very good offer yet knocked it back because the SPL Chairmen thought they knew the market better than Sky TV.  Sky set new standards in covering football, standards that BBC  ITV appear not to have even tried to match.  If you have any doubt about that compare the coverage of the Champions League this season.  What Sky offered was the way it should be.  So now we have moved on to Setanta and, as I write, I am still undecided whether go subscribe or not.  They are promising a better package then they have delivered in previous seasons.  Hopefully they will be true to their word.  The TV Deal in Scotland is allowing the Old Firm fans to see their team playing away from home in the comfort of their living room, or if we have any sense the Pub.  Right away Setanta have moved Celtic's Flag unfurling to Sunday.  I hate Sunday games at home and this one, more than most should have been Saturday at 3pm.  So Setanta will have to wait for me to make my mind up...
