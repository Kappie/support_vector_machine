She was basically saying that I need to make my own decisions and that she did not want to influence me..she says she understands how hard this is for me and how much I love my kids... she said that she really loves me and always will...and I do love her...but from the way I understand it, for women it's either all or nothin'...you can't have a loving relationship and then go back to being friends (thanx for the advice Kathy ;))... I love her and really DON'T wanna lose her...blah blah blah...ok, if ya don't wanna read my "blog" than go away..get your own!...see, i am in a better mood today....i got a hell of a sence of humor...also started giving this URL out to a few friends...hopefully I can start getting some responses too  Bob
