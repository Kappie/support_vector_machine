Anyway, the job situation sucks because of the government and thier fearless leader, George W. Bush. Im I the only one in this great nation or this big world who thinks this guy is a true nutcase? I honestly think that this guy is a grade A moron. On a lighter note, I am over at my friends place and his dad is one of the lucky few who have a 2004 Toyota Prius. I have got to be one of the luckiest 17 year olds because I get to drive this amazing car. But It aint mine, so thats all I get. I hope to get a job here in the near future so I can get my xB.  Anyway, Im getting tired so Ill go before i fall asleep at the keyboard. Peace. ~K-Evil  PS the second post had the worng time on it, disregard that.
