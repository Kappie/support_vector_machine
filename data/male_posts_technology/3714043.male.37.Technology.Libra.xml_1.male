And then something pops up to show how unoriginal I am, how I think like so many before me.  And I just get depressed at the thought that maybe there just isn't anything 'original' to think up anymore.  Sure, there are variations of what's already out there, but nothing original.  I remember one time when I was stoned with some friends, one of them said something that stuck with me.  We were listening to music, and when you're stoned, music is one of the highest places you can go.  He turned to me, and said...  "it's kind of sad about music, there's only a finite amount of compositions you can come up with."  When I was younger I wrote this, sort of, series of fantasy stories centering around a story teller in an inn.  I worked hard on it, long and hard.  I lovingly put a lot of detail in the center piece of the story... And wrote a serial of stories that, although individual, made up a larger story.  I showed it to my friend.  His reply... "Oh, I like this, but it's almost exactly like this book...."  And proceeded to hand me a book off his bookshelf, one I've never read or even seen before.  FUCK!  So what brought this back to mind... I'm going through a little insomnia lately, what having a cold, and working a midnight shift, and wanted to find a picture on the web that sort of captured this feeling, throw it in a post, and write about what insomnia felt like to me...  Well, I must of found about a dozen other blogs called 'the voices in my head' as well as several other blogs that had it's description as 'the voices in my head'.  I know it's not an original idea, hell, it's not even uncommon.  But I thought it would be mine.  Be me.  Be a little different.  Maybe this is what it feels like when you get the first phone book you're going to be in, and your last name is Smith.  I wonder what is was like to see a rose for the first time, and got to be able to name it 'rose'.  Is there any originality left?   urlLink    blah! urlLink
