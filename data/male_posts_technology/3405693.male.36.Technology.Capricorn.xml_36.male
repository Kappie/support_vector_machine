What if a there was a restaurant that only served food your mom made on days she felt lazy.  Not burgers and fries, not ethnic food, not steaks etc, but comfort food.  They could serve things like Kraft Dinner(tm), grill cheese sandwiches with cheez whiz, wieners and beans...uh...spam even.  All those bizarre little meals that aren't really healthy but aren't as bad for you as MacDonald's burger with supersize fries.    It could be profitable; all that stuff has real low costs associated with it; a case of mac and cheese is like 5 bucks...you could probably get 30 or 40 servings out of that.  Even if you went cheap and only charged 2 bux a pop, you just made 80 dollars by spending 5...that's a pretty good margin.  You could sell popcorn as well.  Wieners and beans would be like 2.50 and cost you maybe 45 cents.  And spam...well spam is uber cheap.    The key to place like this would be location.  Now location is always important, but for this kind of place it would be even more so.  You would have to be near a large supply of people who want quick easy eats but don't want to eat another meal at the local choke and puke grease bar.  Perhaps a mall or something with a built in supply of lower income employees.  Another good spot would be near a hostel or similar backpackers type lodge; the kids there never have much money, and tend to be the types to love comfort food.  Heck you could even expand it to include comfort foods from around the world to entice the world traveller in.  Everybody likes to grab a little taste of home once in a while when they're travelling.  The other benefit to having comfort foods from around the world is that will bring in locals who want to sample it a bit.  Not a true ethnic restaurant where they sell the best food from "x" country, but one that sells the stuff college kids eat in said place.  The other key would be to make it a real comfortable environment; people need to want to hang out there. Maybe a couple TV's and couches, like a coffee lounge.  Internet access would be important in the hostel area location.  Cheap internet access.  Maybe a few board games and books to make people want to chill for a bit.  In the end it will all come down to three things: Location, Good Food, and Cozy Hangin Spot.
