In 40 minutes of thinking about it, I could not think of a way. 10,000 years from now, when humans have reached beyond our own planet and perhaps even beyond our own galaxy, there will still be no way to prove God doesn't exist.  This line of thinking might have been triggered by a star trek episode, where Picard sets out to prove this chick who claims shes the devil (and is about to enslave a planet) is actually just a liar with advanced technology.  Picard's way of proving her wrong is that he was able to reproduce every "trick" she could perform, and eventually the enterprise found her ship and power source and she was defenseless.  Well, no such luck proving God is a con-man. But could we disprove his existence by replicating his tricks? Not so easy. If I could create a planet, that would be impressive. If I could create a new galaxy, I might be able to fool people into worshipping me. But who created me?  It's the old chicken and the egg scenario. Which came first? In reality, the chicken evolved slowly from some other animal, and so you can say neither came first. But who created us? Who created the universe as we know it? There can only be one answer.  Scientists have tracked the history of the universe back to when it was only 1 one-billionth of a second old (or something like that). They say they can't go back any further, because the laws of physics as we know them are not valid due to intense heat and pressure (millions of degrees celcius).  So, science can never prove the existence or inexistence of God. We will never know. If we live 10,000 years, we will still not know. If some entity shows up claiming to be God, and can create new planets and galaxies, we don't have the luxury that Picard had -- we can't replicate his tricks, so who are we to say he's not the real God?  Or (to go back to the star trek analogy) what's the difference between a "Q" and God? For humans, none.
