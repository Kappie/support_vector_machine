I am the graphics guy for a wonderful little online site called  urlLink Toasterlogic . TL. Yes, shameless plug. I know. My real blogs site is linked to up there, at shinji.toasterlogic.com, but you could see that, couldn't you? Yes, of course you could. Anyways, as a courtesy to my readers, I am doing a review of the Blogger service. And so far, it definitely has my go-ahead. There are only a few things here I dislike, but don't worry. We at Toasterlogic are working on our own blogging service. This is EXTREMELY nice, and I like it more and more with every keystroke. I must pass on the word.    *shinji has given this service three thumbs up, he stole the third from his neighbor.*
