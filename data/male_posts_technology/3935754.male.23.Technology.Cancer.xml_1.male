After coming back from New York, and going through all the commotion of life, blogging unfortuantely drops pretty low on the list of things to do - but better late than never, I guess.   My re-entry back into Colorado has been decent for the most part. The flights back didn't seem quite as long as the flights to New York, which was a good thing. The one thing that made things pretty weird about flying back on a Tuesday is it pretty much set the rest of the week back by a day. On Thursday I had some things due at the church that I needed to turn in, and I totally missed the deadline because I seriously thought it was Wednesday. It was the weirdest thing for me! It also made work a lot shorter, which was really cool too.  Things with the whole church situation are still pretty interesting. Last week was the first chance I had to meet with anyone face to face, and no matter how many emails that I wrote, and how many phone calls that I had, nothing could replace sharing your feelings in person. I met with Pegge (the campus minister who resigned) and Emily (from the Spirit Fire student leadership team) on Wednesday, and I didn't realize just how much anger about the whole thing I still had inside of me. And as of today I'm still not quite sure how I can express that anger. I'm really upset with our pastor for hiring the new campus minister, despite the search committee's objections not to do so. I understand that it's his decision to make, and he doesn't really need to take our opinions into account, but at the same time I think it's deceitful for him to do what he did. He makes us go through this search process, pretending that he cares about what he thinks, then later on blatantly disregarding our opinions and not even acknowledging our feelings. I've thought about writing him a letter, expressing how I really feel, but I don't know if that will do more harm then good. I need to find some way to deal with my anger. It's subsided a bit, but that's because I've made a conscious effort to seperate myself from the church activities for the time being.  I think besides the anger that I feel, I also have a great fear for what is to come. I'm really afraid about what's going to happen to the program. I'm afraid that this other program is going to come in and take everything over. I'm afraid that this other program won't give our student leadership team any credibility because we're younger and don't have an adult advocate. I'm also scared that a lot of the responsibilities will fall on me at the same time. I really need to step back and re-evaluate my level of committment. In no way do I want to watch the house that we built fall, but at the same time I'm not going to kill myself trying to keep things afloat. I have a tendancy to say "yes" to a lot of things and not say "no" very often. I hope that it's not going to come back and bite me in the ass.  More to come...
