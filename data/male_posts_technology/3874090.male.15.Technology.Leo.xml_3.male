I make their website and its just had a complete overhaul. You can check it at  urlLink www.spikedcola.tk .  Later today Im off to watch  urlLink Leeds Rhinos  take on the Wakefield Wildcats at Headingley. Should be a good game especially after last weeeks demoltion of  urlLink Saints 70-0 !  Then next Satruday Im off to Elland Road for the first game of the 04-05 season vs Derby. Cant wait for that one either.  Trax: The Offspring. They rock. Movie: Still The Pldege starring Jack Nickleson. Mental note to self: Watch good movie today/tommorow. Munch: Porridge. Linx:  urlLink www.spikedcola.tk . What self-promotion never hurt anyone.  Peace out readers! L8rs!, Luke.
