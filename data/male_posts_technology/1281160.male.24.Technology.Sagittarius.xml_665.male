America is just waking up to these movies... the country is becoming as dumb as its president... why don't u people kick out that dumbo...  Sindhu, how long still to go in ur stay in UK... Its been almost a year, ain't it... any plans of returning home... Rajesh seems to be travelling a lot.. no posts for quite some time from him... and Manny too...
