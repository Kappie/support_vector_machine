FindBugs requires JRE (or JDK) 1.4.0 or later to run.  However, it can analyze programs compiled for any version of Java.   The current version of FindBugs is 0.7.4, released on May 27, 2004.   There is also an article in the IBM developerWorks to get started and use FindBugs efficiently.   Nice one.
