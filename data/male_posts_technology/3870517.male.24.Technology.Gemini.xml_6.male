There's the internet, the old-time-style pen pals, and even blind dates. What ever medium it maybe, it is undeniable that everybody is looking.  Famous of them all is the internet. There are lots of dating service available online, there are chat rooms, everything... A lot of people too a getting much profits from these form of businesses... There is this friend of mine who imagined herself getting married to a foreigner, not because of money, just the fondness to the white races... She constantly surf the net and chats with whoever wanted to chat with her, as long as the person on the other line is caucasian... There's also another kind of girl who wishes to marry a foreigner to have a prosperous living... For her, it is her only escape from poverty... These scenarios are common to woman, but what about guys? Some guys don't think of it as a way to get married but for satisfaction, i mean cybersex... It may sound nasty but it is a fact... Some do look for a companion but it is uncommon...  We may have varied reasons to these so called fashion but I can only think of one, the need to connect... the entire universe is so huge for all of us to get connected and we have been wondering what would the other people on the other side of the world be doing at this point in time... we have known this and we have made the necessary inventions to satisfy these needs... Time will come, when we will know that we are not alone in this universe, are we still eager to invent new approach to connect with them?... could you think of yourself chatting or having cybersex with an alien?... hahahahaha! NASTY!  I'm out!
