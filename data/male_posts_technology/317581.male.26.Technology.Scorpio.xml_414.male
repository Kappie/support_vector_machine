Ever since we got that shit home it was cutting out every couple of days, until yesterday when it cut out entirely:P  So here we are. It's nate's birthday. I have 2 parties to go to and no costume. I'll feel like a chump, but what can you do? I think I'll be wearing my white and red "Freak" hat, and maybe a shit that says freak somewhere on it. Where as my roommate karla has a full get up.  Today is also, pay bills and get oil changed day. So that's exciting:)  It's been an excellent movie week. In the past 2 days I've watched, Beautiful Girls, Amelie, and As good as it gets. I love the 2 compliments that he gives her in As good as it gets.   I'm driving to pocatello next week to drive cindy back. ROAD TRIP!!! :) YAY!!! Now I just need to make some good mix CDs:)  OK, I'll catch you on the flip side-
