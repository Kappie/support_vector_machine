It will be too late for the first buyers of the technology, previously code-named Mira, but an important upgrade is under way and will be available later this year."

 Judging by some of the reviews I have been reading, it sounds like it will need an update. Whith this announcement of an update in six months, who would buy one now? As much I think this looks pretty cool, I'll have to do a "wait and see" approach.
