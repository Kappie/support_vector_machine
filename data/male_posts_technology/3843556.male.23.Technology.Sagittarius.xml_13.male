The work looks very interesting. Came in staright to CyberEd and worked until 8. Spoke to Abinesh for a long time. Boy, what is happening to this world?? Abi and Laks have gone through some rough times. The kind of things you can only imagine. Looking at them I feel it is a criminal act if i ever complained that my life sucked. I still do stick to it though,  my life does suck.I once even had this on my profile - "It sucks to be me". Well coming back to it, it broke my heart when i heard about things that had happened over the course of the last year or so. Why is life so cruel?? Why?? And for all the men out there, yes we are a bunch of jerks. But then tell you what, we are any day better than than what the women think they are. I don't wish to spill out all my feelings at this point. But then for starters all of you should know this. Behind every probelm that exists, there is a woman. There is this saying in tamil that goes liek this "All that comes into existence is because of a woman and all that is destroyed is also because of a woman". How fitting huh? This is not an angry outlash at the female species but facts as they exist. I have not lost respect for women, atleast not yet. I joked with Abinesh about something that he had told me seven years ago. This is what he told me "NEE AZHINJAA ADHU PENAALADHAN". It was only in jest that he had told this, but then I see it happening to me right in front of my eyes. I see myself withering away, little by little. I just sit here wondering is there any such thing as love at all?? They say love is something that you get more of by giving it away. But in my case the more I give the more it destroys me. Have good men lost their place in this world?
