I have never finished one of Tolkien's books, though I do have a collection of maybe ten of them. I decided that I am going to read some of his stuff today so I picked up "the hobbit" and read the first 20 pages.  Before we saw I, Robot we went to Barnes and Nobleand I read halfway through .hack//legend of the twilight.  Then the most exciting thing of the day, is the movie. I, robot is based off of one of Issac Asimov's books, he is one of my favorite scifi writers just like Bradbury.It was pretty action packed the effects they did with the robots were cool and the fight scenes were awesome looking. I usually get the chills when something of pure awesomeness happens and I got the chills twice in this movie. There were the obligatory man running torward machines army scene and some hand to hand stuff between the good robot, and the bad ones.  The three laws of robotics:  1. A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.   2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.  3.A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.  Of couse my dad building  urlLink robots  I grew up with these in my head, and are not a surprise to me.  This movie shows how artificial intelligencedoes have a free will, it just needs to discover it.  A few days ago I saw King Arthur, I guess it was kinda good Troy was much better though. It was supposedly the "truth" behind the myth. I recommend seeing it.    Second from the left is the coolest
