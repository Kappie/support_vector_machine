Everyone asks "So what did you do?" and most are surprised to hear the answer of "nothing". What's wrong with doing nothing? I'm an avid fan of it. I swear I could do absolutely nothing forever.  Ok, ok.. nothing isn't really  nothing  so to speak. I mean, I'm cruising the net, playing Gamecube or Xbox or something. So I  am  doing  something , but not going to some caribbean isle or climbing a mountain like it seems most people almost expect you to do with time off.  Give me a beer, my GBA SP, a comfy chair to plaster my ass in outside on my deck and I'd be honest when I say that my vacation  was excellent. :-)
