Cox Memorial Ryder Cup Team. (We still hold a perfect record.)  I was thinking ten years in advance and marveling at the size and number of Nuclear reactors that have been buit on the Montana side of the Alberta border.  It is the only practical means for North America to secure its long term energy supply. (The reactors fueling the process of heavy oil extraction.)
