I am curious as to how he found out about the quote in comment 6, He must have a J thermometer at home so why has he got one when a normal oral one would do? Hell put it in the armpit if you have to but that place is the last place I would want any medical diagnostic equipment placed. Again.  More to the point Custard, why did you read the pamphlet that came with the Thermometer? That pamphlet is more commonly known as "The Instructions". Why do you need to know how to use an anal thermometer?  Ooh, gone a bit to far into the psyche of Custard there.
