We were at Borovetz by 9:00 and then four of us (me included) walked straight to hut Musala, while the others three took the lift to Yastrebetz and then had an 1 hour pleasant walk to the hut. My companions were two guys who each weekend climb mount Cherni Vruh (2290) training for their Elbrus (5633) expedition and the other one was a girl, who spends most of her summer time in Bulgaria hiking. I have not been hiking for months (though my fitness was not that bad), so their tempo was very hard to keep up. We reached our milestone in 2 hours and 15 minutes which is twice less then the map said :) I somehow survived that and afterwards all was easy. One more hour to the next hut an one more to the mount and we are there. He-he I imagined it would be harder, but there was just a little snow and passing small rivers here and there, nothing special. I forgot to put a stamp on my tourist card, but I will sure go to Musala again, so till the next time... :)
