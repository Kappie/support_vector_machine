It's a small division of the  urlLink Monitor Group . I'm really excited about the job (not withstanding the fact that any job in this economy is great). I'm going to be doing interesting work (programming, financial modeling, consulting), working with young, fun people, travelling, and living in a great city.   I also finished up my second-to-last term taking classes here. This term, I am not enrolled, instead working on an interesting hardware design independent study in Hanover. It's strange not to have a set schedule, but nice to be able to control my own work load, beef-up some of my engineering training, and learn lots of interesting stuff.   Other than those major developments, things are good. Enjoying (sort of) the snowy weather up here, seeing my family more often, and spending free time with Jen on the weekends.  Look out for more updates and site changes soon!
