Choose a band/or artist and answer only in song TITLES by that band:  urlLink Slayer     Are you female or male: The Antichrist (or Angel of Death)  Describe yourself: Captor of Sin (or Born of Fire)  How do some people feel about you: Criminally Insane (or Death's Head)  How do you feel about yourself: Cast Down (or Here Comes the Pain)  Describe your ex girlfriend/boyfriend: Human Disease (or Dead Skin Mask)  Describe your current girlfriend/boyfriend: Desire (or Temptation)  Describe where you want to be: Killing Fields (or South of Heaven)  Describe what you want to be: Live Undead (or Tormentor)  Describe how you live: Sex, Murder, Art (or Payback)  Describe how you love: Perversions of Pain (or Necrophiliac)  Share a few words of wisdom: Read Between the Lies (or Show No Mercy or God Hates Us All or Evil Has No Boundaries or Fight 'til Death or Kill Again or Spill the Blood or...)   I only now realized what a great emotional range Slayer offers - hate, rage, anger, discombobulation, evisceration, hate.  The world is truly blessed to have such artists walk among us.  Evil, out
