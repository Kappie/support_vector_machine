I'm going to babysit a friends kid tonight which sort of kills any plans for tonight. Sorry about not posting yesterday one thing led to another and before I knew it it was today. I am getting ready to assault the job market tommorow after my feared dentist appointment. I hate getting my teeth cleaned not only is it painful but I get a guilt trip as well.
