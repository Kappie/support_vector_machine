Polls that show the conservatives at 35% in the Polls vs Libs at 40%, Nationally 30 for the Conservatives vs 38 for the Libs. That seems like an upset to me.   In LNC, things are flying along smoothly. We're getting great reactions from people at the door, and we are getting lots of "I was a life-long Liberal, but I don't like that Martin/Fontana guy". To me, that smells like a riding that will be shifting to Blue!  Personally, it's incredible to see the change as people are now relying on me as a bigger partner in the campaign team. I guess offering 50 hours a week to the campaign can do that :) I only wish I could bump it up to 100, but I guess it's a good idea to be paid, so I'll keep the job here for now :)  Today was a great canvassing blitz that was extremely positive  helped us to via for a dominant position in the riding. Joe Fontana's boys/girls are running scared  we are on a clear path with a strong strategy. Here's to it's continued success!
