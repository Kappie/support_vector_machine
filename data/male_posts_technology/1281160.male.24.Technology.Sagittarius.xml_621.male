Ofcourse u too can write like them. And sujatha is not a great writer but ofcourse unique coz of his flare for writing things which are more scientific which very few writers almost none are popular. Some are good, but not all of his works. For me a writer when he attains a level in writing should be able to produce stuffs which are of better or equally good quality and not less than that. If i start feeling so, then i dont feel like getting back to the writer with the same interest as i did earlier but never shun him totally too with the hope that he might produce something better than that. Recent days i felt a sag in his writing and it double up when i read a story of his recently. At the same time, i read Srirangathu Devathaigal in Kumudam or vikadan i dont know and was impressed by his mild strokes of humour and lauded the lifestyle of their fun filled way of living in those days at srirangam except for the last story in the series. Yes when i read the stories, i felt it was true and almost could take me to those days. But then the last one failed to. dint know y! more after lunch.......
