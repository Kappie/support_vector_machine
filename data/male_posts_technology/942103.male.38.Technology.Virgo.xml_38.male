Click on your favorite team (the Lions, of course) and Campbell's Soup will donate a can to charity.  They'll donate 5,000,000 cans of soup in the end.  This, of course, is just a gimmick and a fun game.  I was happy to see the Lions are 14th out of 32 teams, with 63,487 cans/votes.  The Green Bay Packers are in total domination, having garnered nearly 400,000 cans/votes.   I guess if it can't be my beloved and maligned Lions, it should be the Pack.  So go vote for the Lions!!  Now!!
