 I am all for developers using blogs, but the example  CNet chose was terrible.  urlLink Mitch Kapor's , founder of software pioneer Lotus,  has only made one post in the last month, and a total of seven in the last two. I was already to "blog roll" him and discovered his posting frequency a joke. Call me crazy, but for a blog to be successful you need to post at least a couple times a week.
