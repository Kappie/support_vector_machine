Fortunately, I had an insight; let her start out with a very slow car on a track without too many turns.  Obvious in retrospect.  It started out rough, but she gradually improved.  She drove for three hours last night and now has three medals; one Steel and two Bronze.  That's not much, I know, but that is quite an accomplishment for her!  I played for a bit offline as well, and ranked up to 27.  I tried to find some friends to race online, but there was some sort of major malfunction, so nothing was done.  I also started Gladius, which I quite enjoy.  It reminds me a great deal of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, which I did complete.
