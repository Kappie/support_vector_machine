True to my expectations, I'm not spared of the music from my boss, losing credibility in my reputation and status and its a very very hard day to pass.  I pressed on but really needed support badly which there's no one there for me. Even the special appearance from her did not brighten me much.  I really need to get away from it all, voice myself and be heard. Its been my soft nature that matches with my competitive one, I'm friend's with disasters. I really need to get things right and strengthen myself.  So here's the daily dosage for mind pinchers: Never give up!
