I'm sligtly inclined towards Kicha's arguements......One line was really catchy.."Choose your Priority"...... Bala,  career  work life is important....but life does not end with your office.......which might be hard for you to understand  at this stage of your life.....Seeing your dreams  goals come true, is your only point of focus now.....  I can quote a few examples from my own experience......Ganesh used to work till midnight, before mrg....but now he makes it a point to be at home before 7.00P.M.....Does that mean that he's not working for what he's paid?...He's just learned to balance both his work  personal life.  Bala, is it practically possible for somebody to make chutney from a stone grinder (I would'nt even call it a grinder....two stones....It's the hands that actually does the grinding).....Do you know that rice cooked in a rice cooker or an ordinary cooker is more nutritiuos than the older method of boiling it in a pot of water  finally draining all the starch?....Technology does help you to have nutritious food.....The curry powder which i use for my day to day cooking, is the one which my mom prepared for me(because we don't get it here... i myself don't know to prepare it)..So how am i going to preserve it for an year or so, without my freezer...Does'nt technology help me out there?......  Technology has made the whole world as a global village.....Can  you imagine doing an out-of-book college assignment without the help of google or any of the search engines?.....  If you blame Edison for inventing brightness, why don't you travel even more backwards on the time wheel  complain the invention of zero(we Indians)...if there was'nt any zero, there would have been no math at all.....We would have still been as earlymen counting herds with stones.....making no use of the sixth sense.....  It was not only Indians who lost their jobs, the whole world suffered.....Economy is a cycle of booms  dips...just like a sine wave.....You did'nt complain technology, in a rising economy.... you should'nt complain technology for the fall, because it was you  me who made the field to saturate,  when the level of tolerance exceeded, baaaaaaaang!  When people here ask us, what are we doing  when we say that Ganesh is a software engg... i'm a programmer  computer student...they have been giving this feed back always......"Ahhh! i know.  you guys are really good at that"...Is'nt this something we have to be proud of?....Indians are considered to be intellectuals.....Had it not been for the IT revolution, we would have still been unnoticed......  One final pleasant news....another feather in India's crown because of technology.....One of the American channels is going to telecast a program "India the future super power, because of IT".......A fast spreading news amongst the Indians here....Got this message from Vinitha yesterday.....  Technology can be used both ways..... a constructive weapon as well as destructive weapon.... It all depends on the hands that uses it!!
