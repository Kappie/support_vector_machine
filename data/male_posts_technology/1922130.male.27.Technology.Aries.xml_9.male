Ali and I have been trying to sell our house, it's a small starter home and we're ready for something bigger and nicer.  We've had it on the market for about 5 weeks with NO activity.  Saturday at 10:45am I got a call from a realtor who works at the same company as my agent .  She wanted to show the house that day at 11:30am.  Since we've heard nothing since we put the house on the market I wasn't about to say, "no way, we can't do it on that short a notice," so we scrambled like crazy to make the house presentable and clear out by 11:30.  Turns out the lady who looked at it really likes it and we may get an offer in the next couple of days.  I'll log the house selling process in the journal.  Yesterday Ali and I celebrated Columbus Day (not really, we both just had a day off) by going up to the Blue Ridge Parkway in Virginia.  We loaded the dogs up in the back of the truck and headed out for Rocky Knob and Mabry Mill.   I used to go to that area all the time growing up because it was the closest parkway access to my hometown but I haven't been there in roughly a decade.  It was a nice day and the foliage along the parkway was in full color.  It seems like I've seen it a thousand times but the fall colors still impress me every time.  We went to Rocky Knob first and hiked up to the Knob itself.  It was a little hairy with our two 90 pound dogs, there were a couple of times I thought dog and/or human was going to go tumbling down the cliff, but we managed to make it up and back in one piece.   Next we had a picnic lunch at the park and traveled down to Mabry Mill.  It's an old sawmill/gristmill that is now a historical sight.  Supposedly it is the most photographed location on the Blue Ridge Parkway, so I did my part to keep it that way by snapping a few photos as we made our way around the open air museum.  I'll see how the photos come out (I took an old SLR instead of my digital) and maybe post them.  We did some early Christmas shopping in the gift shop there (I've never ever done Christmas shopping before the week of Christmas) and then headed towards home.   Along the way, we stopped at Groundhog Mountain which may very well be the most boring "scenic overlook" on the parkway.  Basically it is a minifort/firetower (that looks like a kid's backyard clubhouse) and a bathroom .  It did have this display of the three types of rail fences (split, snake, and buck) which was kind of cool, but there was nothing scenic about it and there wasn't an overlook.  We also stopped at Pilot Mtn. State Park on the way home and snapped a few photos of the mountain.  It'a cylindrical rock formation on top of a low mountain that is visible from Virginia to Winston Salem on a clear day.  I live 25 minutes from this park but I'd never been to it before.  I think we're gonna go back and hike the trails there sometime, it looked pretty cool.  I think I got some really good pictures.  My grandmother from Texas is visiting my parents in Hickory so we went up to Hickory to visit on Thursday night and most of the day on Sunday.  Hickory is a cool place.  It's big enough to have stuff to do but it's still kind of redneck and there's a lot of open country nearby.  I like it enough to live there (if given the opportunity) but I'm not sure I want to live THAT close to my folks.  Anyway, it's always good to see Grandma, she's pretty cool to hang out with.    Diet:  I'm down 10 lbs.  I want beer and pizza but I can't have it.  Nuff said.
