This guy (Fred - name changed) started work with us 15 years ago. We should've guessed he was going to be trouble when he got offended by us singing "Old MacDonald Had a Farm". OK, maybe we shouldn't have added the line "Old MacDonald was a pedophile". We do cross the line every now and then.   Unfortunately, Fred has no respect for other people. Everything that goes wrong is someone else's fault. If there's a bug in his code someone else must've put it there. Fred's also the kind of guy who  knows   that his problems are more important than everyone else's. I've lost count of the number of times I've heard him say "It'll only take a minute", and then have to wipe the blood from my ears after 2 hours.   Fred   knows   he's right too. In fact, he's always so right that even when you disagree with him he'll change the question until you say yes, and then attach that answer to his first question. "Jimbob said yes -  see  - I'm right".   There have been lots of weird incidents with Fred. For instance, when he got divorced he was sleeping in his car in the carpark. The other guy in our cubicle and I used to have a competition to see who could get in last on a Monday because the first person was going to get an ear bashing. I usually lost. Moday would start with.   Fred: "So, how was your weekend"  Jimbob: "Yeah, ok"  Pregnant pause  Fred: "Well, at five o'clock on Friday I..."  Half an hour later....  "...and then at six thirty on Friday I..."    Jimbob wipes blood from ears.   But this wasn't the worst of it. Because he was sleeping in his car, he would come to work with a wrinkled shirt. One day Fred was called down to talk to a support person about a problem. When he re-appeared he made a complaint about how unprofessional support were. My roomie replied "Well, at least some of us are professional enough to iron our shirts."   At this point imagine anice red Ferrariand you'll get a good idea of both the colour in Fred's face and the speed at which he left the cubicle.   Fred stormed out of the office slamming doors left right and center.   About an hour later Fred reappeared with a new shirt fresh out of the box. He even got the shirt ironed.   Fred has a problem with criticism, after all, he's always right.   Well, enough of the history lesson, I think you geta fairly good idea of the special kind of crazy this guy has developed.   Anyway, on to the point of my post. Something's going on at work. Fred isn't sitting next to me anymore. While I'm not exactly sure what will happen to him, it's a pretty good bet Fred will not be working at the same office as me in a year's time. He's been shifted sideways. No-one wants to work with Fred anymore. Managers have even refused to manage him.At this point I can hear you ask "Why not get rid of him?" Well, it's pretty complicated. You see, management are scared of Fred. They are scared that if they sack him he'll commit suicide, or worse hurt someone else. This is not a fun position to be in, not for Fred, and not for his ex-managers.   So, Fred is off to counselling. Again.   My only hope is that all of this sideways shifting and counselling is just a way to prevent the murdering and killing when they finally do get rid of Fred. I hope they aren't seriously thinking that Fred can be cured. Fred's been counselled before. It doesn't help. It's just a mental band-aid.   Actually, as a developer, I think Fred would make a good open source coder. They think they're right all the time too. They also don't have to produce anything of commercial value. They can spend two years on a thousand line program making it perfect and no-one will mind. They work on their own in dark rooms. Fred could be an open source god!   Hmm. Never had a god sit next to me before. Just this guy called Fred.
