Do you get the feeling that they think you should feel privileged to be shopping there?   I don't know, the attitude their by their sales staff, checkers, etc. is so irritating.  Sigh....  And whats with the military tribunal at the exit?  Put some tags on the items do whatever you have to, but can we please stop the full body scans at the exit?  Just let me get to my car please.....  OK, whining off.  I will start slowly writing about some issues important to me soon, keep tuning in....well tune in... :)  awright, mustafa out.
