On my last day on Oahu me and Thomas (friend I met in Hawaii who is also from TX) went up to the North Shore on Oahu.  It was a hell of a lot of fun.  The waves were amazingly huge.  We went swimming in it as others did, but some waves you just have to duck under because they were big enough to hurt you.  I’d guess 7-10 ft. waves.  There was also a huge rock there that you can jump off of into the water, probably about 20-30 ft. high so we did that too and it was pretty awesome.  I’ll upload pics of it when I can.
