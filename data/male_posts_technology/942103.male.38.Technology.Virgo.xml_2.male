Of the ones I read, I decided that I could do one that would be at least as entertaining as about half and better spellchecked than perhaps 80%.  I don't guarantee that I'll spell everything right each time or be absolutely grammatically correct, either.  In fact I write in a very conversational tone which frequently lends itself to grammatic license, so there ya go.  I'm most likely doing this the way nearly everyone does at first:  I give a justification for doing what I'm doing, tell how I'm going to do it, and then get into the conversations.  Call me a sheep.  But I'm a self-aware sheep.  I don't really know how often I'll post.  I suppose, as with anything new and shiny, I'll use it frequently at first and then taper off as time goes on and the novelty wears off.  Especially if I realize it's more work than I thought it would be.  I'm a lazy person by nature, so the simpler something is, the more likely I am to use it.  The irony is not lost on me that I'm a systems administrator who deals with computers of all shapes, sizes, flavors, and complexity all day long.  But maybe that's why I like simpler things in life outside of work.  I'm gonna stop now and post this, just to see what it looks like.  A lot like taking a look at those boogers before we flick them away.
