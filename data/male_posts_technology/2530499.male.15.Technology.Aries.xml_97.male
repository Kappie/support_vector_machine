Kelly needs music. Maybe I'll get it (illegally) for her. I'm mad because sprinklers and jobs. Let me tell you, the term "sprinkler" is thrown around. They DO NOT sprinkle. Oh, no. They fucking GUSH.  Kelly, I'll get you your music you like so much, and I'll post about why I think it's perfectly LEGAL to download music.  -beej   >
