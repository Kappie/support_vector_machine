Laura is sick and last night she asked if I could bring her some sorbet.  I parked on South University (in Ann Arbor) about three blocks from her apartment and right between an ice cream shop (Stucchi's) and a store (Village Corner).  I got the sorbet, dropped it off, visited for about 15 minutes and went back to my car.  In my door handle I was greeted with a $75 fine!  I am pretty sure I will be able to appeal this ticket.      I am still not sure if you have to pay a meter after 10 PM.  Most university meters are only checked until 6 PM.  I had no idea that handicap-only meters exist.  Since I didn't think I had to put money in the meter, I didn't see that this was a handicap-only meter.  I was getting ice cream for my sick girlfriend!
