I'm not sure, but still holding my shares.  I have standing sell orders in at $1 and $1.25.  The yahoo message board of course is going crazy with speculation.    I'm glad it's the end of the 2nd quarter of the year, for my e-trade account.  I needed at least 27 trades to keep my "power e-trade" status, where I pay $10/trade.  I had 36 trades for the quarter, and I'm more than happy to have the count reset for a new quarter.  The thing is, though, with my stocks so far down, I wonder if I'll really do any trading.  Maybe ECGI will run up faster than I expect, though.  The only problem with selling is knowing what to do with the proceeds.  In this case though, I should obviously pay down the HELOC debt.  Another alternative is to pay down the auto loan debt, but I'll be paying $280/month for the next 4 years on a 4.9% loan.  That's not too bad - comparable to my heloc rate.  Then again, it's possible that by the end of this quarter, i'll be out of the market altogether, having sold off everything to settle with L.
