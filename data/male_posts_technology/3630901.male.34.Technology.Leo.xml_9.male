I had gotten a page from Jennifer at around 7pm.  She left me a voicemail at work saying sorry she missed me for my invite to a drink on Tuesday.  She said I could call her up until 10pm.  Dean had left a bunch of messages at home and at work, so I called him back first.  He got the new job, but something was amiss and he was feeling a little paranoid about the deal.  I told him not to worry about it -- what will be will be.    Email from jennifer asked what the visitation arrangement was with the kids (I had said every other weekend) -- which weekends did I have the kids?  I called her at home at 9:20 and got her voicemail.  Then I responded back in email that I was free Saturday, and was it too late to ask her out for Saturday night?    She emailed me back in the morning saying it was not too late to ask.  So we're going to dinner at Citrus in Milford, and then to fireworks in Branford.  I called her last night and we spoke for about 30 minutes, ironing out the plans and getting to know each other a little.   If it works out and we get along and we have some attraction to each other, then I have two of our next dates planned out already (maybe).  Camping trip with co-workers and friends weekend of 7/10.  Then a minor league baseball game with my kids on 7/23.  Maybe other dates in-between.  I'm probably getting ahead of myself.  I looked at her profile again, and saw a few things that would normally turn me off:  occasionally smokes, only a high school education.  We'll see.    I'm excited the L had to cancel her plans for tonight because she couldn't find a sitter for the kids.  We're going to breakfast with her parents tomorrow.  I'm doing laundry today and looking into putting our house on the market.
