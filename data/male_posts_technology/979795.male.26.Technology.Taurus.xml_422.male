I'm hoping that making a decent atemi will help me to fall in a more natural way during ukemi.  My first partner was Reno so I didn't know if I did proper atemi or not, afterall he'd just move me if I was standing still. Next was another lady I sometimes paired with. It was OK but I didn't feel comfortable going all out in this case. All I did was try to follow through in slowmo. Then it was with Sunny and Reno. Naturally I couldn't do a thing to Sunny. But I did try to concentrate on committing more, like actually grabbing. Whatever the case, Sunny threw me a couple of times. Didn't manage any fantastic ukemi but did manage to prevent myself from going down too hard and I think Sunny held back a lot for me.  Finally was with Edmund. One thing about Edmund's atemi though, it's rarely 100%. You'd get 100% from him when he does it fast, but then you'd have to know how to make use of the incoming energy at that speed (which I don't). And because of his weight, I also have a hard time trying to apply techniques on him. Dunnoz ...  My iriminage feels crap today. Considering it was with Sunny, I can understand why I don't seem to be able to do a thing. Haiz ...
