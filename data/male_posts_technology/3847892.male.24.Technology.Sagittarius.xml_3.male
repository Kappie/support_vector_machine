Apparently you're only allowed to do that once as you can only be accepted into the "society of the knowledgeable" once. Can't join twice. Darn.  It was sooo nice to see them all dressed up in their black robes, golden hoods with red linings, etc etc. Very funky. They were all smiling at first but then, gradually, the smile were replaced by "have-to-smile-smiles", as parents were pretty much on high demand for photos. Wish I had brought my camera too even if mates might have smashed it in a rebellion against the photos.  Nice to see my name in the list of graduates with a BaSci (Hons). Been working hard for it so I was pretty chuffed.  Had some rum later in the day as parents celebrated last year with me.  Again, congrats to all you graduates and friends out there!  Svenni
