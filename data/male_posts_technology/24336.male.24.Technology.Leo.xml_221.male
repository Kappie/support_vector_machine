It has built in syntax highlighting (different elements of your code get colored differently) and smart indenting!  Smart indenting seems to be working perfectly even though it is touted as being experimental.  I place an open bracket, and the next line will be indented.  I place a close bracket, and the current line moves back 3 spaces.  Perfect.  On top of all of this, it is free.
