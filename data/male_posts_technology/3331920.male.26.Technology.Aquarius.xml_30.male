I will admit that i had absolutely no desire to see this movie whatsoever, but i went with Angel, Tim and Jennifer tonight and it was AWESOME!  I'm so glad i've seen it.  It definitely makes me want to cut out fast food, and especially SOFT DRINKS!! Man oh man, to see what that kind of food can do to a person is just crazy. You don't realize the amount of crap you're shovelling into your piehole every day but it boggles the mind.  I think i've been living in denial for too long. Angel is trying to convince me to go to Weight Watcher's with her, and while i'm sure it couldn't hurt, i'm not quite ready to take THAT plunge yet.  :)  But i'm definitely going to curb the pop and junk as much as i can. Now that this is public in my blog, i've got to stick with it right? Right?  I'm out.
