I decided I really wasn't going to use much of the paraphernalia that came along with PHP-Nuke, and the posting procedure was tiresome, so I switched over to a nice, simple and clean Blogger interface.  This also let's me post using the "Blog This" button on the Google toolbar.  (Yeah, I really am that lazy...)
