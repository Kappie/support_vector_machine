I've been kicking myself for not buying it when it was 2 for $40!! I also picked up my manadatory Van Damme flick, Double Impact, for 11 bucks. But the coup de grace has to has to has to be, and it may be my greatest DVD buy EVER!!! For the low, low price of 8.99, I found a movie I was willing to order online for $30 US. Instead of telling you, I'm so jacked, that I can't even put it into words. But a picture is worth a thousand of 'em, so here goes:     OH YEAH BABY!!!
