All of my Auckland mates that I've bothered to ask are either too broke-ass to come visit, or are otherwise detained ('sif work is a real reason - wimps!) But fate (generous smokey) has bestowed upon me, ample means for whatever I choose to partake of/in. After pricing up printer cartridges, he's left me $200 to re-ink his printer, a photo quality epson, I've since discovered that dicksmith sell the ink cheaper than where he priced it, and low and behold the change that he's told me I can spend, is something in the vacinity of $80 (this is a big deal when you're a sickness beneficiary)  On top of that, because he's undergoing a financial upturn, he has suggested as he will be absent this weekend, that I dont pay rent, and instead have that money as a 'fallback' if I need something during the weekend. Excellent, $180 for the weekend... Sounds pitiful but this is the most money I've had to spend on me without considering anyone else in .. well, a little while :D The downside? I'm in Rotorua where I know next to no one.. other than a few geeks that usually travel across to tauranga for the weekends anyway. Brill. Nevermind, I suspect after all the junkfood I can carry/eat, several dvds and more caffiene than a person should ever consume by themselves without strict medical supervision , that I will care very little :D UNLESS.. that is , unless I decide that I can make headroad into a computer that isnt this 900mhz under-ram'd ..over glorified typewriter.. I admit, I was cruel in that I installed XP on it, it is something much better suited to say.. 'nix, and that xp is akin to making a poor donkey walk up a hill with an army tank on its back. I just wonder tho, if I can stretch my budget far enough to obtain some decent ..as KIT the car would say 'turbo boOst' - hmm. There are two or three pcs here at the moment, a cel 2500mhz 256mb ram, this 900/128, a 666/128 oh, and a 300/128.. ahh what to do. Who knows.. I'm almost tempted to buy fancy bits, then do the mobo/cpu later.. toys are always more fun than just a jump in speed etc. Maybe a new hdd? gah. I might by 180,000 1c lollies. Ka Kite
