Rather than trying to grasp how I move, pay attention to what this old fellow is saying to you - that will enable you to execute the techniques properly."  When students protested his talks were difficult to understand, he replied  "What I tell you may now seem to be way over your heads, but eventually there will be a time when it all becomes clear."   -- O-Sensei
