The editor, Kenneth James Crist, said the story was "just too cute to pass up" (it involves a woman getting her head blown off by a shotgun for entertainment purposes).  An artist named Tom Kelly drew a full page illustration to go with it, and it kicks ass.  Yes!  Somebody illustrated my work!  I rule!  I'm much more talented than you are.  AHHH HA HA HAAAH!  I WILL CRUSH YOU LIKE A BUG!  THE STREETS WILL RUN RED WITH BLOOD, AND POSSIBLY YELLOW AND GREY WITH BILE AND BRAIN MATTER.  But no puss, because that would just be so icky-poo.  Okay, I'm back on planet Earth now.  In related news, I sent another story called "The Path" to  urlLink Wierd Tales  back in June, but haven't yet received my rejection.  I'll give them a couple weeks more to stomp on my heart, then follow up if they haven't done so.  Published, out
