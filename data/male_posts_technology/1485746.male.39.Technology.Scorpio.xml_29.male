I've not been racing in PGR2 very much lately; when I have driven, it has been in RSC2.  But I did play long enough Friday night to get to rank 9 online.  Also on Friday I bought Lord of the Rings: Return of the King.  I've had it in the back of my mind for a while, and Circuit City had it marked down to $20, so I picked it up.  No time to play it yet, though.
