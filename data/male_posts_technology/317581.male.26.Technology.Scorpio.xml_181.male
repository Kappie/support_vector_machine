Although, precious was more about the good person you want to be, not a ring so much) I dunno who MzJaxon is, but they are a mary on the internet that is stalking me.  Everyone Else- Isn't it weird how we all put up a front? I mean, we can't walk around being sensitive all the time. Like I really enjoy museums and especially paintings, but if I did what I wanted to, sit and stare at a painting all day, whoever I was with would get bored and leave. And so I move on in a somewhat quickened pace and don't allow myself to want to look at the painting. I think I'm using this as a metaphor, U long for a deep trusting relationship, but you don't really have the time, and you don't know if the other person wants the same thing, so you skirt the issue... You play that you're not that interested then, if it comes up and they don't like you, then you can say, "well, I didn't feel much for you anyway", when in fact, you wanted to badly, but disallowed yourself to feel.  Everyday, I feel as though I could live like the kid in American Beauty, finding just the most mundane things beautiful, and it's cause I can. However, I find living in such a state of awareness, exhausting. The emotional taxing would be so great, and I'd probably cry all the time.  Well, gotta run, keep it real
