I'm not bitching I'm just sharing.  It's hard to accept that your own flesh and blood is living so far away from you and you're not a bigger influence in their life.  You know you want the best for them but at the same time you know that this is best for him because he is surrounded by love and family (by the grand parents, the mother isn't doing shit).  It's bad.  It makes me sad that someday he might not understand what happened.  That is why I cherish the moments that he still knows who I am, he still recognizes me and wants to play and talk to me because I don't know how long it'll last.  I love you Bryce.  Another plus is seeing Sam.  Haven't seen that kid since what, the week after New Year's?  Yeah, that's a little while dawg.  Anxious to see who he met out there.  Might be cool.  I guess there's some sort of party on Saturday.  That could be a good time.  Well I guess that'll be it for a little while there.  I won't be back home till Monday night.  hope you all have a great weekend.  You - love and such, miss you much
