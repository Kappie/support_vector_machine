I've started the process to get the house painted.  I called to companies.  I'm extremely concerned about getting ripped off.  I'll let you know how it goes.  My son is supposed to be in band practice all summer.  Unfortunately he is not here.  I think he's going to come home and go to practice.  No choice. C is so very concerned about communication, but I'm on top of it.  I'm trying to be responsible.  A new job, new responsibility, new budget, new diet.  Let's see how long this lasts.  Otherwise everything is going great.  I gotta get the house cleaned up, lots of cat hair everywhere, do laundry, and fix that f'ing computer.  Oh yeah!  I turned the AC back on, but I set it to 82 downstairs and 80 upstairs.  I think the computer broke because of the heat.  The garage door will be fixed on Monday.  I'm still looking for a shed out back.    Still like my job.  I'm working on documentation for some scipts.  Until next time.  Kevin
