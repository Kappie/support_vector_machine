Made myself brunch and even before I realized, I found myself cooking dinner. There were plans to go to the movies with Parshu and Reshma which did not materialize. There were these  usual stints of mental suffocation. I get this numb feeling, a lonely feeling that seems to shut out all the light in the universe. A feeling that I would not want even my worst enemy to go through. Reasons are plenty. Few of them nobody can do anything about, a few in my control and the rest in the hands of an angel. Well, to clear the air with regard to my earlier statement, I have made no enemies all my life. So, it was my third straight day at home. Restless as I was, did the best I could to find myself excuses to leave the house. But that wasn't to be until I received a call from Parshu and Reshma. They had missed the last train to Boston. Next thing i know, we were driving to Boston. It was a quiet ride. We managed to lose our way a couple of times in Cambridge but recovered nevertheless. And now, here I am sitting by myself wondering what the day ahead has in store for me. Strange are the ways of life. Don't you think so?
