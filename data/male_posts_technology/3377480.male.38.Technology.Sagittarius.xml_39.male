So he calls his good friend Queen Elizabeth, who says, "Now George, what you need to do is to surround yourself with smart people. Let me show you."  She conference calls Tony Blair in and asks, "Tony, your parents had a baby. It isn't your sister and it isn't your brother. Who is it?"  Tony Blair replies, "It's me!" and hangs up.  G.W. Bush then calls Dick Cheney and says, "Dick, your parents had a baby. It isn't your sister and it isn't your brother. Who is it?"  And Cheney says, "Wow, that's a tough one. Let me get back to you."  So Cheney calls Colin Powell and says, "Colin, your parents had a baby. It isn't your sister and it isn't your brother. Who is it?"  And Colin Powell says, "It's me!"  So Cheney calls Bush and says, "It's Colin Powell."  And Bush says, "No, you idiot! It's Tony Blair!"
