You need the religion only to a certain extent. After that, you don't need any religion" ...   If you can equate religion to a fruit (say banana), the peel or the skin denotes the customs and rituals and the fruit contained inside denotes the values of the religion. The customs and rituals are needed just to protect the value system. Now-a-days, people have left the values and are just hanging onto the customs and rituals without understanding their essence.  ********************************* MOTD: All the misery in this world is because of the ignorance of the difference between happiness and pleasure. *********************************
