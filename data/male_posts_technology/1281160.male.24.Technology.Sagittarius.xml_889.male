I think its quantity and not quality which should be talked about here.(i mean if u are taking two sides of see-saw).  I mean quantity (mass production)against low cost, or quantity (Customised prodn.) against high cost can be two sides of see saw. Is my understanding correct?  If its quality, then as far my knowledge goes, Price increases with increase in quality and decreases with decrease in quality. So i opine that they cant be two sides of see-saw (since both sides can't be high or low at the same time except at the equilibrium position which u have said has got nothing to do with the business we are talking about) except for some exceptions.... So bala make me more clear if i go wrong in my words and thoughts. good that u did give us some inputs reg. mktg... too !Good marketing! unlike sri 's glossary.....  Btw Sri it can be just a mail from AJK to show that she too is there in the group. Nee pathu pakkathukku adicha glossary vida andha mail evalavo mel.  Jax i have replied to ur mail ...  Oh kicha, had a nice time at ur Inter DC meet....... So no wonder u dint attend that play. By the way friends, i had been to watch a play "In the Hour of God" which is based on Sri Aurobindo's epic poem " urlLink Savitri "  for those who dont know the story of Satyavan savitri, wait for the jist of the story in my next blog.....  The play was really very good with all the actors performing so well and excellent accoustics, BGM, good story line and concepts explained in simple words thought it might mean different to different persons based on their level of understanding. Except for few flaws in the framing of some characters and dialogues, the play was almost like a movie. Since its not directly based on the original version of Savitri, but on a reproduced version, virtue of some characters were diluted to suite current day needs which i felt is not needed for such themes.   but then, i enjoyed the play like anything, esp. the character of savitri is such a strong character and the actress was damn good in performing, by giving herself to give the character a real soul. Splendid were her expressions as her words spoke of her emotions, and strength of her inner self. Oh kicha and ram, u missed it ya.  Ok then will blog u all later till then bye for now!
