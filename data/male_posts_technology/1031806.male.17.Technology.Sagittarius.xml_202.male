Yes, even I have trouble understanding some of its contents. Bad, eh? PatchDayReview aims to explain Microsoft's patches in English. Plus, it has a thermometer next to each patch identifying the urgency (critical, important, moderate, or low) needed to implement the patch. The site uses mild bad language. Refer to the category list to find patches for specific software programs. With patches coming out far too regularly, rely on the Patch Guy instead of the updater. -Merl  This brief article is from  Windows Fanatics
