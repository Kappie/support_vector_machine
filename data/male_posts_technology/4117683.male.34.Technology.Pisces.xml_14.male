So I got home, and made dad and I our new Hot Sauce recipe and Chicken thighs! :) yummy!  I am starting to have longer spurts of quasi-happiness... I actually had a belly laugh.. It was at the new one(I think it was Office Max of Staples) with Alice Cooper and His Child.  Well Nothing else to say at this time.. I may post something later this evening.... Oh I had a weird dream last night.. and I actually remembered it! I wrote it down also! I may write about it... How about this... Once someone else either puts something in my area: Comment, the link thing-ie, or that other one on the right of the page, then I will tell you my fucked up dream!  Don't ask why I have a condition on that!@  Oh well  lates!
