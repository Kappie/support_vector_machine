It all started because shortly after having Ethan I started on my diet and exercise routine, I was doing pretty well, but then I got sick and the migraines...blah, blah, blah. Long story short I have packed on the pounds! I have been complaining now for a couple months. Mom came up with this idea a little over a month ago for us to help each other loose weight while racing against each other. For every ten pounds lost the looser has to do something for the winner. For example Mom has told me that if I were to win she would buy me a sundae. Sneaky, huh? ;) I had lost 4 pounds the first three weeks, but I am scared to get on a scale at the moment because I de-railed myself when we took our mini-vacation. I have been slacking on the exercise, late night snacking, and portion sizes...I think that about covers the whole spectrum of weight gain. Oh, well. I just have to get the self control and discipline going. Everyone wish us luck and to the victor goes the... sundaes?
