Tee Hee Joe's music to me is okay, but i dont want to listen to it everyday, the same goes for the kinda stuff the grungers listen to. I prefer pop type songs or ones with beats and lyrics, such as songs from blue, westlife, ect The problem is easy, get rid of the stereo, if someone wants to listen to music, play it in a personal player ect... simple
