Porsche drivers were the least faithful, with 49 percent admitting infidelity, followed by BMW drivers at 46 percent. So if  I  was on a date with a BMW driver then I'd be inclined to watch them.   Ah... but they also get the most sex. If anyone wants me, I'll be the one looking good in the 3-series...   I thought I'd "gay it all up a bit" with that LifePartner stuff... seeing as we've gone a bit gay in here today! ;)
