London: We took off Friday afternoon, and descended on a  very  slow journey to London Heathrow, an even slower ride with the train to Watford, finally to arrive at our destination: Ten and Chick's apartment. The rest of the weekend was lovely though, and worth every hassle of Brazilian airlines and slow London trains.  Legoland: a full family trip with grandparents, children, grandchildren, brothers, sisters, parents-in-law, sisters-in-law and so on... If you are searching for the child within, Legoland is the place to go. Here you have everything from miniature cities built out of Lego, rollercosters to make you scream your lungs out, carousels that will make you very dizzy, lots of food, coca cola and popcorn.  Norway: friends have a summer house up on the mountain in Norway overseeing the ocean. Who can say no to an invitation like that... The occasion was the baptising of friend's daughter. Nice weather, lots of relaxation, beer and braais so it was a close to perfect weekend.  Sick: The obligatory summer flu hit us hard as rain on a typical Danish summers day, and the only solution: stay in bed, sleep, drink lots of hot tea and try to get sympathy from as many of your friends and family as possible.
