After my Xmas holiday is the Oral test which is 20% followed by exams in May, another 40%. All quite heavy. But I think they are definitely lighter compared to all my other IT modules. Next week also got a Project inspection coming up. I don't theink I really need to prepare anything and I was told it's not gonna be accessed. But knowing that I'll be facing some lecturers and they'll be questioning me on some areas of my work kinda scares (terrifies) me. Sigh, wish my demo day will either be 1st day of the week or the last day which leaves me to be really unprepared, or really well prepared.  Aikido cancelled last night. Sensei was down in Blackpool. Tonight's training is taken by someone else. But I'm feeling kinda tired from all the school work. Sigh, not sure how leh. Really think I should go down and train today coz I don't think my schedule can permit me to train next week. And I'm not sure there's any training for the Xmas holiday either. Would love to though. Maybe I'll just ask. But I suppose I can always train my swimming again. I've stopped for about 3 wks now. Thought I had managed to hit back 2km in 50 min. But Think now I'll have to re-train over from 1km onwards. Think I'll try to aim to hit 5km swim at the end of my holidays. However, I don't think I'll push myself for the timing. Just make it really relaxed first. Once I got the stamin back then mabbe do some sprints / speed up my time. Err ... that also means improving my tecnique. Poor technique slows me down as well. Hmmm ... sounds a bit like Aikido. Maybe I should emphasize on my technique first. The speed probably comes much later. My mind in Aikido always seem stuck on technique and rushing in on the speed. Bad bad....  Had a bit of disagreement with Corrine last few days. I know we had problems but I didn't expect that we'd have so much differences. I really hate to see her being so emotionally affected by things I did (or didn't do). Feel so bad sometimes but I also dunno lah, think we both got things we need to work on. I was really surprised that I even suggested some time off (ok lah, more like a break-up) from both of us. But I was even more surprised by her response and effort to try to keep things together. I feel a little ashamed. Coz now I dunno that when I suggested the break-up, wheather I was taking the easy way out or I really thought we aren't compatible? But I felt really really reallu elated by her saying (similar lah, my memory not that good to remember the exact words gramatically), "I'm also not sure if we are making a mistake or not, but I'm really willing to take the 'risk' with you." O man, because of that phrase, it practically erased most of the doubts and fear in my mind. I just think, no matter the mistakes or what, so long as we're making the step together, it's the right choice. Even if it means that someday in the future we really do break-up, but because of the fact that we had made whatever decisions together, it's can't be a mistake. Right? ... Sounds a bit chim, now that I'm re-reading my own words. But, aiya, that's just me lah. I can't phrase and express some things properly. I'd like to just follow my instincts. Even if it means 'losing out' in some way or making a mistake. I mean, there's no better time to make mistakes and pick yourself up while you're still young, rite?
