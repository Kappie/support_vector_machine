I'm on my second copy, a cheap $7.99 paperback that I got from Walden's back in November.  The spine is pretty banged up, and there's blue ink on it from where it had the unfortunate luck of being in my backpack when a pen exploded.     But pages 258 and 259 are the subject tonight.  It'll make this kind of a long post, but goddam it's worth it.       "Highway 13 follows another branch of our river but now it goes upstream past old sawmill towns and sleepy scenery.  Sometimes when you switch from a federal to a state highway it seems like you drop back like this in time.  Pretty mountains, pretty river, bumpy but pleasant tar road ... old buildings, old people on a front porch ... strange how old, obsolete buildings and plants and mills, the technology of fifty and a hundred years ago, always seem to look so much better than the new stuff.  Weeds and grass and wild flowers grow where the concrete has cracked and broken.  Neat, squared, upright lines acquire a random sag.  The uniform masses of the unbroken color of fresh paint modify to a mottled, weathered softness.  Nature has a non-Euclidian geometry of her own that seems to soften the deliberate objectivity of these builings with a kind of random spontaneity that architects would do well to study.     "Soon we leave the river and the old sleepy buildings and now climb to some sort of a dry, meadowy plateau.  The road rolls and bumps and rocks so much I have to keep the speed down to fifty.  There are some bad chuckholes in the asphalt, and I watch carefully for more.     "We're really accustomed to making mileage.  Stretches that would have seemed long back in the Dakotas now seem short and easy.  Being on the machine seems more natural than being off it.  We're nowhere that I'm familiar with, in country that I've never seen before, yet I don't feel a stranger to it.     "At the top of the plateau at Grangeville, Idaho, we step from the blasting heat into an air-conditioned restaurant.  Deep cool inside.  While we wait for chocolate malteds I notice a high-schooler sitting at the counter exchanging looks with the girl next to him.  She's gorgeous, and I'm not the only other one who notices it.  The girl behind the counter waiting on them is also watching with an anger she thinks no one else sees.  Some kind of triangle.  We keep pasing unseen through little moments of other people's lives.     "Back in the heat again and not far from Grangeville we see that the dry plateau that looked almost like prairie when we were out on it suddenly breaks away into an enormous canyon.  I see our road will go down and down through what must be a hundred hairpin turns into a desert of broken land and crags.  I tap Chris's knee and point and as we round a turn where we see it all I hear him holler, "Wow!"     "At the brink I shift down to third, then close the throttle.  The engine drags, backfiring a little, and down we go.     "By the time our cycle has reached the bottom of wherever it is we are, we have dropped thousands of feet.  I look back over my shoulder and see antlike cars way back at the top.  Now we must head forward across this baking desert to wherever the road leads."     When I first read that back in high school, I stopped dead.  I literally couldn't read the book for the rest of the day.  Perfection, like simple choices, is a rare thing.  Being able to see someone so clearly say something so profound, with never actually saying anything related to their target, is astounding.  I could smell the gas from the motorcycle, could feel the heat baking off the road, and could smell the artificially sweet smell of the air-conditioned restaurant.  Usually with a book, I'm bouncing from one topic to the next, always begging for the next subject.  To be stopped cold, and to get 'it' so clearly, took the book from one of my favorites to the best I've ever read.     I mean, I can tell you how good "The Stand" or "On the Road" is, but it's because of the cumulative story.  I can't point to one page and go "there!"       And also, it speaks to my traveling spirit.  I'm taking road trips more often now, just to kind of quell it.  I like where I am right now, and where I'm going, but I feel a need to move again.  Taking random trips across half the country makes it better.
