Had it been a cricket match; especially between India  Pakistan, people would have cried foul immediately after the match would have ended in such a tight finish and speculated about match fixing. But it was football, Euro 2004 Group B opening match between England and France.  England after leading 1-0 for all the match, inexplicably lost (threw?) the match to lose 2-1. Not doubting Zizou's genius, but to concede 2 goals in less than 3 minutes, its just too much for me to believe. All the experts also said the foul on Zidane was needless. But was it really needless or was it delibrate? Also the second infringement that resulted in a penalty. Pretty hard to believe.  Was the match fixed in France's favour? We won't know. There is so much betting nowadays in Football, I won't rule out the possibility.
