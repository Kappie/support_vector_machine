This was not a campaign rally, but a presidential visit.  What happened to these two people?  They were arrested for tresspassing!  I have nothing else to say.     Innocent coincidence?  I think not   urlLink AlterNet: Election 2004: The Church of Bush  This story is a good read.  This guy went to some georgie shrub house parties to talk to the prez's faithful.  Good discussion.  Please read this when you have a chance.  urlLink t r u t h o u t - Gagged 9/11 FBI Whistleblower Naming Names  I haven't finished it yet, its pretty long, but what I have read so far this is SCARY as hell!  Movies: I saw  Y Tu Mama Tambien  tonight.  Pretty good, but alot was cut for this R-rated version, I'll have to see the unrated version. oo  We watched  Starsky  Hutch  the other night, I thought it was funny, silly funny, but funny.  Good stuff, any time you have snoop dogg getting slapped in the face by Vince Vaughn, you know the movie is pretty funny.  Also watched   urlLink Outfoxed   the other night too.  Pretty good documentary.  Pretty amateur graphics but the content was pretty good.  It laid out a good case for why FoxNews is not news and ought to be outed for their underhanded ways.  Ok that is enough for tonight.
