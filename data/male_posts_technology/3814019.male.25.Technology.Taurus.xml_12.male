They just go to prove that shit really does always float to the top. My dad told me an interesting story once.        A manager at a big distribution company decides one day to try and save the company money, he doesn't particularly like most of his staff and has no control over how it runs as he has a spine akin to that of a worm. So, to save the company money (and gain precious brownie points) he recruits the aid of "time and motion" specialists (at a ridiculously large expense). These specialists turn up and monitor how the business runs, they make notes as people go about their daily chores, they ask questions about procedure and so on and generally just mooch about assimilating the company and its going ons. After they are satisfied they get their heads together, write up loads of reports and make hideously difficult graphs which baffle all and sundry and eventually come up with The Findings. And do you know what they decided after looking into the whole of the business dealings and seeing all the staff work? They decided that for the business to run smoothly and save money the company should get rid of the manager, the very same man that called in the experts in the first place.        I found this story immensely amusing at the time, and it made me realise that managers, far from being the head that's needed for the body to function,are in fact the wart on the arse that irritates the body no end and causes all manner of uncomforts when it sits down for a moment or two.        I have a new manager. I used to work for the family business, and management usually entailed common sense and using that soft, squidgy thing between your ears (and no I don't mean the spot on my nose). Upon getting a "normal" job I discovered management didn't need either of those properties. I feel cheated. I cannot for reasons of self preservation divulge details (see "100 reasons for never getting married" for previous examples) so I will skip round the details like a switched on pedestrian would skip round a turd on the pavement. Suffice to say, I find it appalling that such a pathetic excuse for a human could possibly manage to breathe without an instruction manual, nevermind manage a team of workers.
