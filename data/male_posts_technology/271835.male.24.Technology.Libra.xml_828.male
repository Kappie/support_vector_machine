Sounds like something the government said  urlLink years ago  when a headmaster was stabbed and killed. Today's announcement is of course due to the schoolboy who was sentenced to life yesterday for the murder of another schoolboy. So just how is making carrying a knife illegal going to stop people stabbing other people? If you want to stab someone I don't suppose the illegal act of carrying a knife is going to put you off. It may have worked for guns but that's due to gun ownership being made illegal unless licensed. So are we going to need a licence to own knives?! Or is Mr Blunkett just repeating old promises that he has no intention of fullfilling? And will it make any difference anyway?
