The new house is nice and we are just getting settled in. We have decided to give the kids the big bedroom and we will get the smaller two fro us. One will be the office. There are alot of little things that need to be worked on but it will get done over time. I set up part of the network last night and we will be getting our Internet set up in a few days.   Just testing some stuff:    urlLink HTML Dog
