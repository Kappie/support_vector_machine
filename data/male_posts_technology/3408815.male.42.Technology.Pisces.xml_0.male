I however never served. I won’t spend time explaining why I didn’t serve. The times were strange back in 1980. I’m an only child and my parents didn’t want me endangering myself, and after Watergate and Vietnam I thought it was a good idea.   I do appreciate the sacrifice through. They did something no young man should have to do. End their time when their just really getting started. So as my kids play and I enjoy having the time to write this, a special thanks to all those brave men in every war and "police action" who paid for my freedom with their sacrifice.      THANK YOU! GOD BLESS YOU!
