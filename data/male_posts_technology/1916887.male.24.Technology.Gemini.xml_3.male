More on Windows 2000 backup command-line switches. : "Windows 2000 backup command-line switches."  Syntax ntbackup backup [systemstate] "bks file name" /j {"job name"} [/p {"pool name"}] [/g {"guid name"}] [/t { "tape name"}] [/n {"media name"}] [/f {"file name"}] [/d {"set description"}] [/ds {"server name"}] [/is {"server name"}] [/a] [/v:{yes|no}] [/r:{yes|no}] [/l:{f|s|n}] [/m {backup type}] [/rs:{yes|no}] [/hc:{on|off}] [/um] Parameters SWITCH DESCRIPTION  systemstate         Specifies that you want to back up the system state data. When you back up the system state data, all of the system state data is backed up, so the /s switch does not apply. Also, the backup type is forced to normal or copy.  bks file name Specifies the name of the backup selection file (.bks file) to be used for the backup operation. A backup selection file contains information on the files and folders that you have selected for backup. You have to create the file by using the graphical user interface (GUI) version of Backup.  /j {"job name"} Specifies the job name to be used in the log file. The job name usually describes the files and folders that you are backing up in the current backup job as well as the date and time at which you backed up the files.   /p {"pool name"} Specifies the media pool from which you want to use media. This is usually a subpool of the Backup media pool, such as 4mm DDS. If you select this, do not use the following switches: /a /g /f /t.   /g {"guid name"} Overwrites or appends to this tape. Do not use this switch in conjunction with /p.   /t{"tape name"} Overwrites or appends to this tape. Do not use this switch in conjunction with /p.   /n {"media name"} Specifies the new tape name. Do not use /a with this switch.   /f {"file name"} Logical disk path and file name. You cannot use the following switches with this switch: /p /g /t.   /d {"set description"} Specifies a label for each backup set.   /ds {"server name"} Backs up the directory service file for the specified Microsoft Exchange server. The /DS command line switches for NTBackup (with Exchange 5.5) no longer work with NTBackup for Exchange 2000. The Directory Store (DS) switch is not relevant since Exchange 2000 uses the Windows 2000 Active Directory. The Information Store (IS) switch does not apply since the structure of the Information Store has changed from Exchange 5.5  /is {"server name"} Backs up the Information Store file for the specified Exchange server. The /IS command line switches for NTBackup (with Exchange 5.5) no longer work with NTBackup for Exchange 2000. The Directory Store (DS) switch is not relevant since Exchange 2000 uses the Windows 2000 Active Directory. The Information Store (IS) switch does not apply since the structure of the Information Store has changed from Exchange 5.5  /a Performs an append operation. Either /g or /t must be used in conjunction with this switch. Do not use this switch in conjunction with /p.  /v:{yes|no} Verifies the data after the backup is complete.  /r:{yes|no} Restricts access to this tape for the owner or members of the Administrators group.  /l:{f|s|n} Specifies the type of log file: f=full, s=summary, n=none (with n, no log file is created).  /m {backup type} Specifies the backup type. It must be one of the following: normal, copy, differential, incremental, or daily.  /rs:{yes|no} Backs up the Removable Storage database.  /hc:{on|off} Uses hardware compression, if it is available, on the tape drive.  /um Finds the first available media, formats it, and uses it for the current backup operation. Use the /p switch to designate a device-type media pool when you use the /um switch so that Backup searches for the appropriate type of media, such as 4mm DDS. When you use the /um switch, Backup searches the following media pools for available media: Free pool, Import pool, Unrecognized pool, and Backup pool. When available media is found, the search stops and the media is formatted and then used without prompting you for input. This command is not applicable to tape loaders and you should only use it if you have a standalone tape device.
