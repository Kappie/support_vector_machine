Their  urlLink website  is still being updated.  2 days ago, their secretary emailed to inform me that CAA and TAS were not related. She sounded friendly enough. Luckily I checked my account today. Updated the Aikido in Singapore blog but somehow the site seems to be down pretty often. My personal blog doesn't seem to have it as often. I might have to change it to something more reliable for Aikido in Singapore.  I emailed my Sensei to ask if I can record down some of our training sessions for personal interest. She hasn't replied my email yet (just checked prior to publishing this blog). But just in case, I've already brought all my stuff to Uni since this afternoon (coz I'm not going home first). Even had to loan the brand new 38 ltr backpack which Daniel (my housemate) just got for his birthday last weekend. Alamak, opening ceremony by me somemore. But the bag was cheap and good (by North Face). I'll probably go get one this weekend (if the sale is still on), otherwise I'll always have problem carrying my Gi and notes for training on Wed. Today was especially heavy because of the video camera and a tripod stand I loaned (from Daniel again :P). Wah, I tell you, look damn professional leh. Hehe. Even worst, heng heng everything I bring with me is in black. Black tripod bag, black backpack, black t-shirt, black gloves. Daniel said, all I need now was a black sunglass.  Really hope Pauline Sensei won't object. If I can, I'll digitise some nice clips and send to  urlLink Eileen  and  urlLink Gary . It'd be interesting to show everyone how cuckoo I can be sometimes hahaha. Cuckoo-Tan ...   ...  OK better finish up some stuff before I go and see my supervisor in about 1 and a half hour. After that, it's Aikido!
