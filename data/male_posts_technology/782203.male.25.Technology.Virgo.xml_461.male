Another weekend spent doing absolutely nothing of consequence except maybe the fact that I did manage to level up my Weapon Master/Fighter/Rogue in Neverwinter Nights a bit. Ya that was fun.    Nowdays I feel that every day I stay at home is one day of my life wasted  and will never be able to gain back.  And that's really depressing. Why don't I ever get to doing the things I know I wanna do? I got no idea.
