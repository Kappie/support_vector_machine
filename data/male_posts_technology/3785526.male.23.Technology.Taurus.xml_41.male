Visits the place in the pretext of seeing off his friend. Goes to the shopkeeper and asks for a DVD list. It looks like he wants to buy everything out there. But his small pockets would allow only two. So, after a lot of self debating, he goes for Amelie and Shawshank Redemption. Now he comes back home and plays Amelie. So far so good. Plays Shawshank Redemption but the player says "No Disc". Bala is angry now. He goes to the shokeeper in a maddening traffic. Breaks his rear view mirror of teh bike in the process and asks the shopkeeper for exchange. The shopkeeper plays the DVD and it works. Bala can't believe his eyes.  Comes back to his house and plays it. Surprise, it doesn't play. He becomes like a madman trying out the DVD in all the players. But no player would play it except the one kept in that small shop. Bala is reformed. He says "Yes, sir. Absolutely. I've learned my lesson. I can honestly say I'm a changed man. I'm no longer a fool in the society. That's the God's honest truth. No doubt about it."
