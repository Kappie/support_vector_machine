Lynne Cheney's comments on CNN put her at odds with the president and her husband.   From:  urlLink Lynne Cheney: Leave gay marriage to the states    She also says people should be free to enter into relationships they choose.     So, I'm from Dick Cheney's home town of Casper, WY.  In fact, my highschool nearly got renamed after the Vice President.  Of this relationship to the Vice President, I'm not particularly pround.  Remember, our common home-state is also home to high profile stories of anti-gay  urlLink violence  and  urlLink  religious  antics .  Anyway, it's nice to see Lynn Cheney standing up against her husband to show some level of support for their lesbian daughter, Mary.
