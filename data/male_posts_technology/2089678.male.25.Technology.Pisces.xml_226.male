Testing is even more important in the wireless world because working conditions vary a lot more than they do for most software. For example, wireless Java applications are developed on high-end desktop machines but deployed on handheld wireless devices with very different characteristics.   The aim of this article is to help you test your wireless applications. The article:   -Provides an overview of software testing  -Describes the challenges in testing wireless applications  -Presents a tutorial on testing wireless applications  -Furnishes testing checklists for user interface, networking, and other areas  -Discusses certification programs for applications targeted at the Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition (J2ME applications)   [Resource-Type: Article; Category: Java/J2ME; Level: IMD/ADV; XRating: 4]
