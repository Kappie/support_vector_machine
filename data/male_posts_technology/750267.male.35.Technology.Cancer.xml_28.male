The White House would have you believe it is: - punishment for not complying with the U.N. - preventative strike to protect the United States  The United Nations has reached an agreement to bring Iraq basically back into compliance with weapons inspections, and the Americans oppose it. So that rules out the first point as the reason for war with Iraq.  Iraq can, in no way, launch an attack against the United States. These days their army consists of a bunch of guys riding camels. The worst they could do is Israel, and Israel is not the United States. Israel has a huge strong army, and it can defend itself fairly well. So that rules out the second point.   The real reason, of course, is: - Iraq has remained defiant against the Americans, after all these years, and it pisses the Bush family (both Sr. and Jr.) off.  Ari Fleicher said today about the cost of war with Iraq, "I can only say the cost of a one-way ticket is substantially less than that. The cost of one bullet, the Iraqi people taking it (on) themselves, is substantially less than that, the cost of war is more than that."   So, the real reason is that they'd like to see Saddam ousted, preferably killed. Why don't they just come out and say that already?
