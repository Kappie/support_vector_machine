They outsmarted me multiple times.. They are small...  And at last they are my close frens ( now a days) ...   Who are they???????????????  There are  urlLink these creatures  in my room...  Initially I hated them.. As I started my hands on cookin.. There are lots of food stuff which my mom managed to send it for me.. These ants were spoiling each of them..   I tried all the means But some how they managed to sneak thorugh the firewalls ... But now I love them...   They have a these good  characters... dedication.. persistence and patriotism too for their community.. Heck!!!... they keep trying till they get to the destination...   Hope I do have an ants mind ...
