She looked fantastic, and it was so nice to be sitting there with her, and playing with our three kids together.  They all got along fanastically.  My son taught hers how to play with a toy.  Her son fed mine.  Her daughter was wrestling with me and we were all laughing and having fun.  It was just so nice, and I felt so good.  It wasn't until I left, that I realized something.  I felt like I was at home.  I felt more at home sitting there with her, and the kids, playing and laughing together than I've felt in a long long time.  I don't even know when the last time was I felt that way.  It just felt so good, so right.  I just wanted to write this down, so I'll remember it.....
