It would be unbecoming of me to show up empty handed, so I thought I would bring the following:     Smoked Salmon Guacamole   Sundried Tomato Salsa   Blood Orange Sorbet   3 Watermelons(1 spiked with grey goose)     I would bring more, but it really isn't my party.  Should be fun, hopefully that guacamole will turn out okay, I've never smoked a fish. I'll post recipes on Saturday for those interested.
