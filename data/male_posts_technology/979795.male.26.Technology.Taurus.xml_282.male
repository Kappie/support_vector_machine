We spent a great deal of time waiting and had to do OT. A bit sianz about the late book out but I reckon I should start to prepare some clothes and leave them in my locker so that I can stay in camp whenever I need/want to. No point going home everyday also.  Had quite a long chat with 2-3 reservists in the day. Shared a lot of insights about how I felt about our education system(one of them being a teacher), past experiences and stories out in the field (which wasn't much for me), etc. It was nice.  The next 2 days are probably gonna be the busiest for me. Really have to be ready to stay in if it gets too late. It surprised me even more that the RSM had to go to anothercamp even late at night. I guess this exercise is taking its toil on everyone.
