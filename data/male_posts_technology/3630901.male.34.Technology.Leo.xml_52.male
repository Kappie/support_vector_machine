I took the movie to be a lesson in overcoming despair.  Any situation that I'll likely face in my lifetime will pale in comparison to the desparate situation that Joe experienced on the mountain.  From the comfort of my house, I can call it a metaphor for a life obstacle that can be overcome, basically by focusing on each little step that is required in order to reach the big picture.  But never really focusing on the big picture because it will be too overwhelming.  So for me, my life obstacle is rebuilding my life after divorce.
