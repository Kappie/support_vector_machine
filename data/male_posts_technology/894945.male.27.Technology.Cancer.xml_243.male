(thanks to Kerrie for this)  Um Bongo, Um Bongo, They drink it in the Congo  Friendship bracelets were ties that couldn't be broken.  You know all the words to "Ice Ice Baby".  You wanted to be on "Jim'll Fix It".  You can remember what Michael Jackson looked like before he had plastic surgery.  You had a Global Hypercolour t-shirt.  You know the profound meaning of "Wax on, Wax off".  You were upset when She-ra, Princess of Power and He-Man got cancelled.  You remember Madonna in her cone stage outfit.  You knew "The Artist" when he was humbly called "Prince."  You wore fluorescent-neon clothing... (if you can call it clothing!)  You could break dance (ok, you wished you could)  You remember when Amiga was a state of the art video game system.  You remember M.C. Hammer.  You can still sing the rap to "Fresh Prince of Bel Air"....  You can remember when it was Jazzy Jeff and The fresh Prince and NOT just plain Will Smith!  You own any cassettes.  You carried your lunch to school in a Gremlins, ALF or ET lunchbox.  You have ever pondered on why Smurfette was the ONLY female smurf.  My Little Pony, Gummy Bears and Transformers are familiar to you.  You had a Swatch Watch.  You believed that "By the power of Greyskull, you HAD the power!"  Big wheels and BMX's were the way to go.  With your pink (or blue) portable tape player, you sang to Kylie and Jason!  You owned Polly Pocket or Micro Machines.   You made Ken fall in love with Barbie.  Partying "like it's 1999" seemed SO far away.  You knew that Transformers were "more than meetsthe eye".  You wore a banana clip at some point during your youth.  You were led to believe that in the year 2000 we'd all be living in space.  You know what leg warmers are and probably had a pair.  You wore cycling shorts underneath a short skirt and felt stylish.  You recorded songs off the radio with your boom box.  You never questioned why the A-Team were always imprisoned in places that had sufficient tools to build an armoured tank.  Dungeons  Dragons was your favourite programme. (WHAT do you mean, WAS? - Toaster)  You said "bright light, bright light" in a strange high-pitched voice.  You fell out with friends during heated arguments about the relative merits of Male characters out of beverly hills 90210.  Cerise pink, electric blue and banana yellow have ever featured in your wardrobe or make-up collection.  You did the top toggle of your coat up around your neck without having your arms in the sleeves, and you knew you looked like a superhero.  Your new winter coat was best used to demonstrate that your wings were like a shield of steel.  You still remember when the A-ha video was the pinnacle of modern technology and you can still sing all the words.  Your best party dress was either a ra-ra or puff-ball skirt.  You remember watching a house inhabited by a jester, a pantomime horse and a woman who sneezed, and thinking that this was perfectly normal.  You tried to convince your Dad to fit a strip of red lights on the front of the car so it looked like KITT.  You had more than 10 sweets in a 10p mix-up.  You hid behind the sofa whenever you heard the word "Exterminate!".  Girls - You owned a pair of Pixie boots,generally worn with leg warmers.  Boys - You owned a pair of pale grey slip-ons,generally worn with white towelling socks.  Ooh, you could crush a grape!  You held a chicken in the air or stuck a deckchair up your nose.  You wore legwarmers  tried to do the splits while jumping in the air while singing you were going to live forever.  Your best mate had a Soda Stream at home and you were jealous.  Any elderly Scottish lady sounds like Supergran.  When 'Computer' Tennis, Pac-Man and Donkey-Kong ruled.  You remember hearing the tune then running out to buy an ice cream cone on a warm summer night - 99's, screwballs or a cider lolly.  Water balloons were the ultimate weapon.  Important decisions were made by going "eeny-meeny-miney-mo."
