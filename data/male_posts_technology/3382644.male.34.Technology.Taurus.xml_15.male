It was good medicine. I decided to join PokerStars.com tonight.  I did it because I had seen a lot of commercials for it watching the BlackJack tournament on Bravo.  It is the site that Chris Moneymaker plays on and qualified for the WSOP last year.  It's a pretty cool site.  I like the layout and I like the ability to upload a custom graphic for your player icon.   I sat down at a playmoney 10/20 limit game and it was fun.  There was some pretty good play.  Not as good as Poker School but still pretty good.  I bought in with $200 and left the table with $1100.   I went on to finally get on Party Poker since I haven't been on there awhile.  There site was slow tonight.  They have been that way a lot lately. I played a 50/5 play money limit tournament and placed 6th.  I just got bored with the game and didn't care.  I'm tired tonight and the play just isn't fun on there anymore.  Not for playmoney at least.  PokerStars seemed to have just as many if not more players on their site.  I might start playing there more to get a variety.   That's it for tonight.  I have a long work day and night tomorrow.  Won't be playing again until Wednesday.  Hopefully will be playing for money again soon.  I really want to get my game top notch before I enter that arena again.    Indiana Slim
