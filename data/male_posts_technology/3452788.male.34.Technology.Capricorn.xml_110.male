She often refuses to accept my authority, or her role in the parent-child relationship.    How can I earn her respect without resorting to intimidation, emotional abuse, etc?    How can I avoid using the so-called parenting skills I learned as a kid?    Sheâ€™s smart; maybe just talking to her about it will help.    Unfortunately, that does not get the teeth brushed any easier or help her remember to not make a mess with food upstairs.  It is worst when I am in enveloped in depression, although it is still a problem with me during the "good" periods.
