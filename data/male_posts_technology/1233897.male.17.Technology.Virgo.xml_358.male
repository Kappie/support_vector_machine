I should have to... I'VE seen this on my own  this song is a, poem to myself, it helps me to live...  in case of fire, BREAK the glass,  and move on into your own... your own...  reoccurring drowning effect entrenching my brain, I hope you'll be ok someday, so I can say that you moved on in the right way...  WE'VE seen this and  WE'VE breathed this and  WE'VE lived this on our own...  this song is a, poem to myself, it helps me to live...  in case of fire, BREAK the glass,  and move on into your own... your own...  BREAK...  this song is a, poem to myself, it helps me to live...  in case of fire, BREAK the glass,  and move on into your own...   Well, today was enjoyable. 'Got up around 10 o'clock, took a shower, headed to CCWC for the first time in ... forever. I saw Sarah (Steven's gf) for the second time there, the first was in Jan. (I think - lol) Later I ran into the Gadeholts and Ben, and followed them over to the Gadeholt's house where I stayed until past 9. Well, that's not entirely true, I did go with them to pick up Kat from Washington square and to go eat at Xtine's restraunt... but that doesn't count since I was with them.   Man, that was fun... I miss my sophmore year.
