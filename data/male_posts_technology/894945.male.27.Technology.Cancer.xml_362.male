Remember, in the world of romance, one single rule applies:  “Make the woman happy”.   Do something she likes, and you get points. Do something she dislikes and points are subtracted. You don't get any points for doing something she expects. Sorry, that's the way the game is played.  Here is a guide to the points system:   SIMPLE DUTIES  You make the bed..............................................+1 You make the bed, but forget to add the decorative pillows.... 0 You throw the bedspread over rumpled sheets...................-1 You leave the toilet seat up..................................-5 You replace the toilet paper roll when it is empty............ 0 When the toilet paper roll is barren, you resort to Kleenex...-1 When the Kleenex runs out you use the next bathroom...........-2 You go out to buy her extra-light panty liners with wings.....+5 in the snow...................................................+8 but return with beer..........................................-5 and no liners.................................................-25 You check out a suspicious noise at night..................... 0 You check out a suspicious noise and it is nothing............ 0 You check out a suspicious noise and it is something..........+5 You pummel it with a six iron.................................+10 It's her cat..................................................-40   AT THE PARTY  You stay by her side the entire party......................... 0 You stay by her side for a while, then leave to chat with a work colleague................................................-2 Named Tiffany.................................................-4 Tiffany is a dancer...........................................-10 With breast implants..........................................-18   HER BIRTHDAY  You remember her birthday..................................... 0 You buy a card and flowers.................................... 0 You take her out to dinner.................................... 0 You take her out to dinner and it's not a pub.................+1 Okay, it is a pub.............................................-2 And it's all-you-can-eat night................................-3 It's a pub, and it's all-you-can-eat night....................-10   A NIGHT OUT WITH THE BOYS  Go with a mate................................................ 0 The mate is happily married...................................+1 The mate is single............................................-7 Not for long - it's his buck's night..........................-10 He has a liking for Kings Cross establishments................-50   A NIGHT OUT WITH HER  You take her to a movie.......................................+2 You take her to a movie she likes.............................+4 You take her to a movie you hate..............................+6 You take her to a movie you like..............................-2 It's called Death Cop III.....................................-3 Which features Cyborgs that eat humans........................-9 You lied and said it was a foreign film about orphans.........-15   YOUR PHYSIQUE  You develop a noticeable beer gut..............................-15 You develop a noticeable beer gut  exercise to get rid of it..+10 You develop a noticeable beer gut and resort to loose jeans and baggy Hawaiian shirts......................................-30 You say, "It doesn't matter, you have one too."................-800   THE BIG QUESTION  She asks, "Does this dress make me look fat?"
