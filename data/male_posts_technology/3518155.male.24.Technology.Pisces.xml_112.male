A Nagpur court has sentenced a 24-year-old youth from Parseoni, Maharashtra to seven years Rigorous Imprisonment (RI) for 'ditching' a girl.   According to Nagpur rural police, Vilas Namdeo Uke had promised to marry a girl in 2001. Their relationship had led to her pregnancy.   The judge also slapped a fine of Rs 1,000 and, in case he fails to pay the penalty, Vilas would undergo further imprisonment of three months.      Apparently, in an unrelated sentencing, he received an additional 9 months for failure to pray in the mornings, 6 months for thinking dirty thoughts, and 200 hours of community service for failure to wash his hands after using the toilet.
