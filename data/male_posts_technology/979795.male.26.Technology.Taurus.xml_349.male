Luckily she's not the kind to bear grudges. Actually wasn't actually anyone's fault. I felt that it was just a huge misunderstanding. Anyway, never mind. It's over and it doesn't seem that anyone's been seriously psychologically scarred over the matter :P... whew.  Aikido was great. I realised a lot of things about my technique as I was doin it. For Shihonage, Gary's pointers on keeping arms slightly bent is good. I tend to pull with straight arms. I went home and thought things through but I think the bent arms helps me a lot more to bring uke down to my centre.  Lotsa kokyunage free practice in the final 30min. My group was with Karen, Li Hsing (Johnson's gf) and Alvin (I think, I've seen him but not sure if that's his name). I think I was basically rushing too much liao, I felt like I didn't manage to maintain my balance, posture or even do proper atemi. But still, at the end of the session it was fun. Did a series of kokyuho with Darryl again. He's better at feeling the force from uke than I am. But I felt that he has a bit of 'Wallop' in him too. They both tend to be more concerned with showing what they can do, than help their partners. It's not like they are selfish or anything, they just think that they are helping better in that way. I'm saying this because at the end, Darryl was basically the one doing more of the feeling movement instead of just bringing me down. But he did so much until I didn't think I was an effective uke as I didn't have the energy and strength to keep applying force against him. Oh well ...  I'm a bit nervous about starting the eLearning classes next week. I will be busy for the next 6 weeks or so taking classes of students and teachers. I have about 60+ teachers to train, re-train, conduct workshops and 1500+ students to take. All of which needs to be familar with how to use the eLearning system around early April. I think I'm going to ask Sensei if I can go Pillars from next week onwards because I'll probably need to do OT ocasionally. It'll also mean I can probably grab a bite before training coz Pillars and Siglap are so much nearer. So far I've been skipping meals whenever I need to go BVCC. Not a good thing in the long run.
