Most are surrounding an issue or two.  NONE of them are valid.  NONE of them will tell the true character of a President.  Issues aren't important.  I shouldn't have to care if G.W. is for or against Gay Marriage.  I shouldn't have to care if Kerry is for or against Gun Control.  I shouldn't have to care if Bush thinks porno should be on the internet or not.  I shouldn't have to care what Kerry thinks of abortion.  Issues SHOULD NOT MATTER AT ALL.  This is where our country has fallen apart in the last 100 years.  The public has been handing over control of this country to politicians one silver spoonful after one silver spoonful.  By the people, for the people.  That was a belief once.  We shouldn't need a politician to tell us if we can get an abortion, buy a handgun, watch an x-rated movie, listen to obscene lyrics, or anything else.  It is not the job of the government to tell me what I can do.  Just because you believe that abortion is wrong, DOES NOT MEAN IT NEEDS TO BE LAW!!!  If we are to legislate on beliefs and our own ideals, then I move we outlaw all infants.  They're messy.  They can be a drain on society.  They provide little positive input to society.  They are not self-sustaining.  We are close enough that cloning could become our primary source of reproduction.  Sounds silly doesn't it?  Why?  Cause you like infants?  Cause that's the way it's always been?  I have news for you, wasn't but 120 years ago that EVERYONE carried a gun 24/7.  Now, you have to jump through 7 million hoops, pay several "fees," and be a damn near perfect citizen.  Let's look at abortion.  Everyone has a stance:  Pro Life, or Pro Choice?  Which are you?  I cannot fathom a scenario where I would want my wife or any woman I know to get an abortion.  Abortion is against my ideals.  The idea of it is not pleasant.  I don't have any altruistic reasoning for my belief.  It falls on a scale of not wanting to vomit after I drink a few too many - it's not going to kill me, but is still an unpleasant thought.  With that being said, just because I think it's wrong, DOESN'T MEAN IT SHOULD BE LAW.  Bob down the street might NOT think it's wrong and he should have every right to seek out an abortion from a like minded doctor.  Same for everything.  Guns - don't like them, DON'T BUY ONE.  "Vulgar" talkshows and tv - don't like it, CHANGE THE FUCKING STATION.  Porn - don't like it, DON'T WATCH.    Bottom line, don't tell me I can't do something because you don't like to do it.  With that said, you may be wondering, how do I decide whom to vote for?  Vote the character of the man.  Vote for a man (or woman I suppose) who stands by his decisions.  Vote for the man who can learn from his mistakes (with the exception of your's truly, I'm pretty sure EVERYONE has made one or two of those).  Vote for a man you would be proud to introduce as your father/husband/son/brother.  Don't let one issue decide the vote (hell, don't let just a handful of issues decide).  I do not share the same beliefs of nearly ANYONE on the planet.  In fact, most of my friends have VERY different beliefs than I do, yet I would trust them with my life.  I'm certain all of us have friends and family who believe very differently than we do.  What is it that makes them our friend and garners our respect?  It's the character of the man (or woman).
