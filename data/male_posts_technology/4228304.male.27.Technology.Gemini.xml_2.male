Today's been great as I get to see this gorgeous damsel who's forever smelling so nice and its so torturing having to conceal my joy when she's around. Guess wat?

Through this run, its funny that I'm always so different from the average people where I can excel in the part where they fail and I do badly in the part where they excel. Wassupwidat?!  As for my good old brudder, never hear from him today and I'm really to busy to disturb him or gotten any "greetings" from him. Think he must be sms-ing alot with his June and hey, remember?
