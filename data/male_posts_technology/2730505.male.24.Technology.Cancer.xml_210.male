Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.  although I have work this Sunday, I count that as next week's work day even though it counts during this pay period.  Whatever.  It's all good to me.  I guess after Sunday's work day where I will be running around the building getting all of the thin client and fat clients to be 100/Full I get Monday off.  I will probably need that.  Some days I am sick of this 4 day work week thing that we have going here but most days it's working out just fine.  It's that god forsaken game Rainbow Six 3.  We won't talk about that.  I've been recently mulling about what to get first as a big purchase.  A big TV or a sweet little desktop computer.  Granted I use both religiously, I don't know which I will enojy better.  I have a littl 19" in my room that I play XBOX on and I have a peice of shit laptop that keyboard works in sporadic times.  I know that I will be playing XBOX a lot more than the computer and computer games because of Halo 2 and XBOX Live.  Then again, Half Life 2 and Doom 3 are coming out this year, that's a coupel of highly touted games right there.  I've also been wanting to play counter strike against all these supposed gamer girls but my laptop probably won't run it.  TV or Computer.  I originally wanted a laptop but for a sweet gaming laptop, it's going to cost me $3000 at the very bottom of the scale.  For that much, I might as well go buy a 52" DLP HDTV with a HD receiver.  I will probably enojoy it that much more.  I don't want to buy a TV because where the hell am I going to put the damn thing?  I don't own my own place yet so it'll be a hassle to have it in my tiny ass room.  Besides that I have to save some moeny for my trip out to the Philippines in December.  That's going to cost me a little bit and on top of that I gotta take my cusins shopping and all that crap.  Yeah...  Halo 2 on a big TV or Half Life 2 on a good computer or going on a trip to see blood cousins?
