Then, at bout 1, I called Farazeh to wake her up. We were to meet at lunch today :D. Then, I went to dad and aplogized to him for not listening to him last night. And promised him that it was the last time. It took me sooo long to convince him... uff! Neways, then I went online for some time. Chatted and read news. I accidently saw the time... it was 2... damn!! I had forgotten!! I quickly disconnected... and went to take a bath. I dont even remember the last time i bathed so quickly :p. Neways, I changed and disconnected the net. Called Farazeh. She said that she had to tell her mom bout goin but she wasnt answering the phone. She told me to call again in a few minutes. Then, she said that her mom was still not answering the phone... and since it was already 3... we decided to go to KFC at 4. So, I went online. She also came on. We chatted for a while. Mamu came. So, dad told him to drop me instead. Bro was to go to defence too so he packed his stuff... well, the games and other boring stuff. Neways, I had said that ill be there at 4.... but got there at 4:25 :o. I had expected her to be there... but she wasnt :(. So, I called her. She said she was on the way... so I told mamu that my friends are coming and that he can go now! :p  Neways, I had to wait for almost 20 minutes b4 she came. In the mean time, I paid so that she wont get to do it... hehe :p. I began munching on some fries and had some coke to kill time. It didnt seem to move!! Finally, she came :D. It was the first time we were meeting so it did seem a little awkward at first... but then we settled in. We ordered the food and then just talked, talked and talked. I dont even remember bout wat... but we still just talked and talked. I really enjoyed it. She was just like I had expected :D. I ate 2 zingers and she was like... aur khana he?? hehehheh. Then, I msged dad from her cell to pick me up. When 5 min passed... she was like: "Abu andar to nai aa jaeyin ge??" Lol. I was scared too... hehe. So, after another 10 min, I told her to better go or i might get in trouble :p.  Then, I looked for a PCO to call dad bcz it was already 20 min since i called. I called him from somewhere and he still at home!! :@ I went back to KFC and waited for him. He came after another 25 minutes!! Then, mom wanted to get the new school books for adil so we went to the bookshop and got the books. Then, I got home. Went straight to the loo!! :p Then I changed and sat at my pc. Sana was online... she was like: tell me wat happened??!! hehehheh... so I told her the full story and she also told me something ;) I was soooo happy after that :D. Then, I started chatting. Time seemed to fly. Farazeh came and i chatted with her too. I chatted for almost 3 hours... my fingers literally began to ache!! Itni windows thien... everybody was so eager to get a reply!! :s Neways, I got off at bout 10:00... and watched TV. Infact, "Kyoun Ki Saas bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi" hehehhheh. Then, I discussed the trip we were planning with dad. We were plannig to go to Kalam, Malam Jabba and Nathiagali. Then, at bout I came online again. Surprisingly, few people were on :o. Neways, I posted at the forum for a while then got off again.  Then, I heated some pizza leftover from yesterday and ate it with apple cidra :D. I was really in a happy mood... and had made up my mind that i was gonna do it. But im still waiting. I guess today is not the day then. Neways, I just unblocked Murad and gave him a long lecture. Lagta he ab samajh gaya he... lol. Now, I remember that I promised that I'll go to sleep early today. Well, 2 isnt early, but still :p. Damn yaar... i dun wanna go.... but i still hve to!! :@  This is my day... i might hve missed some stuff... but the best part is there... and ill surely remember it for the rest of my life!! :D
