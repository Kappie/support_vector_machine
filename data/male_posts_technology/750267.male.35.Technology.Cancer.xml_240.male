Russia has recently become the  urlLink world's largest oil producer :    Russia is pumping some 8.6 million barrels of oil a day, compared to 7.96 million for Saudi Arabia.   Russia is not part of OPEC either. Perhaps the Russian situation may also lead to the destruction of OPEC.  See " urlLink OPEC's Swan Song ".
