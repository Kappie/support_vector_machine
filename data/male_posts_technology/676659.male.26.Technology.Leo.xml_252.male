And Noli De Castro leading by 1.1 Million votes over to Loren Legarda..  We've been talking about the Presidential Candidates here that we forgot about the Vice-President.. Whom did you vote for Vice-President? I voted  urlLink Herminio Aquino ..  To know a little more about the candidates (although it's too late! hehe),  urlLink CLICK HERE .. Check out  urlLink FPJ , coz' his profile was all about showbiz and none about politics..  Whoever wins, let's just pray about it! :) Success and Development doesn't only depend on our leaders but also on the people under them.. Let's just pray for Cooperation and Unity across the nation.. :)
