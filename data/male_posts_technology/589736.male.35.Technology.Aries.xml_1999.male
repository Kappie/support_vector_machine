I guess he is trying to expand beyond "That 70s Show" and "Dude, Where's My Car?"  Ben - Good article.  I did notread 100% of it (got a Cliff Notes version?) , but it reinforced my apprehension about Wal-Mart.  What I did not see it mention was what Wal-Mart has done to the smaller niche businesses.  You know, the ones like a bike shop or small fabric store or even an independent drug store (as versus CVS or Wal-Greens).  Do you recall the huge fight that Ashland put up against the Wal-Mart opening there?  It was very big news when they one, but the victory was only temporary.  The Wal-Mart is now open.  I have not heard how it has affected the small businesses in Ashland.  On the flip side, I am hypocritical for criticizing them.  With one salary and 5 mouths to feed, Julie does 80+% of our shopping at Wal-Mart, in part because of price and because of the convenence of going to one store and getting everything we need.  A recent trip included soap, diapers, an oil filter, and a gallon of milk.  There's not too many stores that have all four of those items
