On the drop of a dime you could have to stop, take medicine, crawl into bed, and hope to get to sleep before it really starts hitting you.  My doctor is nice in the fact that he gives me the free migraine medication samples that they are given, so I don't have to pay for a prescription. I looked up some of the prices, and all I can say, is wow doc! Thank you!   For me, migraines are dehabilitating.  I get a running fever that varies from feeling like I'm freezing, or burning up, with drenching sweating.  Bright lights, and sounds make my head feel like it wants to explode.  I can easily tell anytime that I've gotten food poisioning from fast food, because after eatting, 20 minutes later my stomach starts to rumming, then the head starts to throb, then the sweating starts.  The best thing I can hope for then, is to have to throw up as it seems to really help out.   Once, I had a migraine in the afternoon, and as I laid down, I was   ok. Then I had a cool breeze blow throw the window above our bed, and I had to throw up.  Never had that happen before.  I'm really thinking about taking the docs offer of giving me a referral to a neurologist, to see if we can came up with a reason as to why I get migraines. It varies..sometimes I won't have one for 3-4 weeks, and then I'll have two reasonably close together.  I can do w/o the pain.  You learn to identify what signs your experiencing to tell you have a migraine coming on.  For me, usually, it starts as a throbbing in my right temple, sometimes left. It gradually gets really bad, where I feel that either a blood vessel is going to blow up, or it's trying to pull itself free from my body.  Either way, it's excrucitatingly painful.  If I haven't head migraine medication by then, it wont happen period.   I get the aura's on occassion too, and suffer from the "after-period" that can range from 1 day, to 3 or 4.  I would REALLY enjoy not getting these things.  I have no known trigger, except bright lights  . Thats the only one I can think of.  It's been suggested that long sessions of driving cause them. I make trips back to where I grew up, ever couple weeks, usually to work on pc's for friends, or just visit family. Z*lda thinks it's the long drive that does it.  It's 1:20 1way.  When I helped drive on our summer vacation in '99, in my parents 27ft long travel trailer, I didn't have a problem at all, and I was driving for 3-4hrs straight.   At one point I had a gray tint to my glasses to help with headlights at night, as they can be really really killer.  I've not had the that for a few years, but I did get antiglare coating on them, and that seems to help alot as well.     Well, enough of this for the night, time to go tend to my post-migraine, and hope it stays just a post and does become "a" again.
