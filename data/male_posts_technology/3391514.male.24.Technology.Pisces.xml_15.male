Also, a new series of  Lexx  began last night, which is good, as it is usually highly amusing, and the episode did not disappoint in that regard.  How can the adventures of a spineless coward, a love slave, a dead man and a robotic head piloting a giant insect that can blow up planets be not good?  My pre-op assessment is less than 24 hours away... it probably involves needles and tests, so I'm not best pleased.  I have recently come to a realisation of something, however, I'm not going to post it here as this Blog is not totally anonymous.  Let's just say its not a good thing, and has built up over a number of days / years.  In other news, my acquisition of the  Lone Wolf  RPG has reignited my interest in the series.  I have decided to look for the last two books needed to complete my collection of the novels... it seems they are very hard to come by.  I even tried playing the first game book this afternoon... and met my end at the claws of Doomwolves on the road to Holmgard.  There's always next time.
