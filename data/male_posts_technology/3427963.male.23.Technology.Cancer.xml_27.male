Totally no mood for anything, maybe been thinking too much i guess. Thinking bout wat she had said and thinking this that and everything.   "the worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right beside them knowing you can't have them", tell me bout it lah.....thats wat i'm going thru now and it really sux lor, SERIOUSLY!!! Its like she single but not available kind of thingy and it really feels like shit to be "not rejected" and "not accepted". Its like buying lottery and the lottery never did open.....dun know got win or not. i think u all know wat i mean rite?? Bai lui li bai, dou mei you kai.....(starting of song to "tu ran fa cai") haiz.....dun know wat to do liow lah.....is this a test??  Came back from work cos no one to go out wif and no one jio go anywhere.....so sian...last week also like that. Boring Friday.....went for jog before dinner and its the longest i had ran since ORD.....i ran to bishan park 1 or 2 i cant recall and actually ran the whole of the park 1 or 2 once. But realli shagged out after the run.....leg aching a bit now....maybe i overdid it lah. after that had a nice bath and ate dinner.....played my guitar a bit and here i am bloggin nonsense again.   "i'm not crazy,  i'm jus a little unwell,  i know rite now u cant tell, but stay a while, and maybe then u'll see, a different side of me.  i'm not crazy, i'm jus a little impaired, i know rite now u dont care, but soon enuff u're gonna think of me, and how i use to be..."
