When she get's back to my side she'll tell me "Baby, this just ain't going to work. I've had Bono for 4 minutes. How could I possibly go back to you?"   She'll then follow Bono around the world. She'll get to dance with him one more time before being halled off to a chinese jail for life - charged with stalking.
