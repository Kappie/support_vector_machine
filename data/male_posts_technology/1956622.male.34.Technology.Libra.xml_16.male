For the last 3 days or so I call and the first words out of Karissa's mouth are "who is on the phone with you daddy?"   Not Hello Not Hi Not how are you?  Given the e-mail exchange that took place the other day after her phone call ordering me not to allow her family to talk to Karissa or she would hang up on me the increase in interest seems a little fishy to me.  So after I told Karissa it was just daddy she started making noise in the phone like yelling noises and stuff.  Then she must have handed the phone to Lisa as I heard Lisa say "I don't want it you take it" then I hear stomping feet and Karissa says "I don't want to talk anymore daddy"  She gives me the usual hugs and kisses thing then hangs up on me.
