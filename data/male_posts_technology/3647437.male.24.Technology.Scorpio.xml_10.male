This town is expensive and money certainly oils the wheels to make life more convenient if not simply accessible. Quality of life without a stack of money appears to be a tough existence eeked out by making life easier for folks higher up the salary food chain. The entrepreneurial spirit is incredible.  Homelessness exists although not to the scale I was expecting. I haven’t seen Harlem yet and have stayed close to central Mid-town with a few ventures to the financial district in downtown.    The sheer size of this place is staggering. I’m resigned to the fact that I’m only going to see 0.1% of what I should. I’m making an effort to get about when I can but the humidity is oppressive. Tomorrow is museum day where I’ll get to the Metro and the Guggenheim. Thursday I’ll try to get to the Intrepid and see a bit of Greenwich village.    Learning to use the subway was no small achievement – bar the incident where I ended up in Brooklyn by accident! One must be care not to catch a train in the wrong direction.    Central Park is an amazing oasis in the craziness. New Yorkers are fiercely proud of the park and it’s beautifully maintained. The park is an enormous collection of lakes, mini forests and walkways. It even has a mini-zoo. The park is in constant use by walkers, joggers, cruising gays and those infernal cyclists who deem it necessary to wear full road kit to blast around the park during their lunch breaks.    Such apparent wealth is stunning to see – it’s readily on display. There are enormous stretched limos, private helicopters ferrying corporate folk about and the odd car truck with it’s delivery of latest model Lamborghinis. Every skyscraper, especially the older ones have a unique charm and add to the flavor of their district. My personal favorite is the Chrysler building lit by night – it’s beautiful. My favorite modern structure would be the twin glass towers of the Time Warner complex. I’ll need to get down to see Grand Central at some stage.    This place really does never sleep. Times Square draws people in simply because it’s ever constant, frenetic pulse. The building sized electronic billboards turn night into day allowing a constant flood of humanity through the congested streets means.  You’ve got to be constantly aware of where you’re heading and whats going on although I’ve never felt unsafe.  The games of three card monty, imitation Gucci sales stands and portable food vendors (yum pretzels) add to the sights, sounds smells. At one point there were several three card monty games happening on the street where I was near Times Square. A cry went up and within seconds the games, the gamers and their paraphernalia had disappeared into the crowd. Police wandered down the street seconds later none the wiser. I’d seen nothing like it.    The NYPD are a friendly bunch and they’re everywhere. It’s certainly a well policed town. The federal buildings are covered in guards. The NYSE had it’s own battalion of SWAT teams, dogs and regular police milling about. People are expecting specific sites to come under another attack at any time - whether the policing is going to help them, I really doubt it but the blue suited troopers make good direction givers to lost tourists.    Locals are looking at $1000 a month for a tiny studio to live anywhere in Manhattan. It’s no surprise people choose to live in the outlying districts. Brooklyn, The Bronx etc are all within striking distance via the bus and subway routes and friendly locals tell me you get a lot more accommodation for you money in the boroughs.    Several things strike me about this town. The first thing is the ethnic diversity. Walk down the street and see blacks, Asians, Europeans and all manner of accents charging about. My favorite dialect is the thick New York drawl. I have enjoyed great conversations with the Hotel barmen who love to chat about their town and their experiences.    There is so much I have to not say for lack of time. I’ll post a few of my favorite pictures taken thus far. Will try to add another update about NY before I leave.
