I usually don't want to say what is usually on my mind at that time, because I it is probably something pretty dirty (with my mind "in the gutter") a good amount of the time. Something like "I was kind of thinking about what it would look like if I put your ankles on my shoulders and fucked you really hardcore" isn't really something I picture myself actually saying... and therefore the woman gets... "i dunno" usually followed by an awkward laugh (if my mind actually is in the proverbial gutter).            The reason I bring this up of course is, because this is what I did last night (and it has happened before). I decided to meet this girl who I met online a little while ago and go out to dinner with her. She is a college graduate of the age of 22 and she majored in Japanese, which I think is pretty damn cool because of all of the Japanese animation that I like to watch. So.. I get to the place ( urlLink Sushi-Taro , which is a really good restaurant which I highly recommend if you like sushi/Japanese food) and she is waiting outside. She has a cute face and a round-ish figure, but I am not one to discriminate... much. We go in and have a nice sushi dinner and small bottle of sake (12 oz. is that small?). The conversation is pleasant but we are way better at talking to each other over IM in my opinion. Awkward pauses in the conversation and she is not a loud talker (although she told me she likes talking dirty during sex which I don't usually associate with quieter people, I guess I will now) made for some slightly interesting conversation but nothing to write home about (first time meetings are a bitch). We finish, I pay since it sorta felt like a date, but then she buys some cigarettes which we smoke before I invite her to my place. We come over and she doesn't want me to turn on the TV, so I take this as a sign that we are supposed to be making out... I have no idea what I SHOULD be doing. I said "I don't really know if I want a relationship right now", which I said in a serious tone and "but we can go have sex if you want", which I said jokingly. To which she replies that she "has heard that before", which obviously makes me feel like an ass. I still had no idea as to what I should be doing. "What are you thinking?"...fuck... "I dunno", pause forever "what I could be doing to you" d'oh, now I HAVE to make out with her! Why? I don't want to hurt her feelings, she is a nice girl. I should try to have sex with her because she would feel wanted and I haven't had sex for a year and a half. I shouldn't have sex with her because if I do, and she wants a relationship and I don't, then I would feel like a piece of shit. Since I was already taking her top off at this point it seemed kind of moot. My penis was in control (just kidding), but I just hoped that maybe she would remember that I actually did say that I didn't want a relationship from before. I was in luck because even though I was "whipping her up into a horny frenzy" (she really did seem very turned on) and rubbing her clit through her pants, her metro ride would be leaving soon. She looked at the clock and said that it was getting close to the time she needed to catch the last train. I took this as a sign to get her the hell outta there so that I didn't have awkwardness in the morning when I get up at 5:30 and don't know what to do. Anyways, I help get her top back on and walk her to my front door. Was I avoiding disaster? I dunno. But I do know that I COULD have sex with her, I just don't know if making her a friend that you fuck would be a good idea. This post is too long, enough for now.
