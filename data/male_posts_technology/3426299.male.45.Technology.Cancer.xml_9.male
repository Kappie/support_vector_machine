Last May 19, 2004 my car's back glass was broke in the parking area along the street. I don't know how and who did it, I asked the guard and the did not noticed it also. I asked help to the company I work and my boss told me to wait until Monday till my big boss arive fron his trip. Today she email me since my big boss trip is extended. Is it proper to ask them for help? The PDF format letter that I made can be viewed at http://www.wilmarguday.homedns.org/docs/parking problem.pdf.
