Player vs. Player is another online comic that I am reading now.  Most of the characters talk about playing their favorite PC games (mostly FPSs like Quake III, Half-life, and UT).  A running gag is that the troll of the group, Skull, only plays Pokemon.  I read the entire  urlLink archive  and all of the mentions of Pokemon warped my mind.      For all of your having trouble with Pokemon Silver, here is a  urlLink walkthrough .  You can thank me later!
