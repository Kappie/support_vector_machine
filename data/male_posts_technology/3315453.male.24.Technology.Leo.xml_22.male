We ended up on a ferry ride to, well I can't remember.  Anyway other than being a little cold it was awesome.  The view was really cool from all sides and the sunset was remarkable.  I just wish we had brought our camera so I could have posted some pictures.  We will most likely be going on it again over the summer because it only cost about $5 a person both ways if you don't get off.    Before the fairy ride we went to the film festival here that was showing Hero, a Chinese movie.  We had already seen it on DVD because we knew someone that had bought it from china, before Miramax bought the rights and stopped producing it until it has gone to the big screen.  The cinematography in it is spectacular, the plot was awesome and the fight scenes were some of the best.  In some ways it was better than Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  I would highly recommend this movie to be watched on the big screen especially if you liked Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  That was pretty much our day today.  We did go play some pool with one of Justin’s friends and go to Pikes Place as well.  All in all it was a fun day and a much needed break from school.
