I dropped my older daughter to the school bus stop and managed to spend 20 minutes with her. She is a chatterbox. I like it that way. I think kids who talk a lot get thru problems much easily and faster when they grow up. We will also (hopefully:-)) get to know what they are up to when they are in their teens just because they talk a lot.  After sending her to school, I was relaxing catching up with news. Since I was awake till 1.30 or so, I had no particular plans to hurry to office early. But, my friend wanted to try car pooling and I am at office by 9!! This hopefully means I will be out of this place to spend dinner time with my wife and kids on time. I always get back to work after they all sleep at 10 or 10.30 at night.  I am looking forward to another great day! Lots of interesting work.
