Im your host, K-Evil and I would like to say one thing to all of you, this is my first blog and, if it sucks, well thats just tough now aint it! No one said you had to read it anyway. Just kidding ya'll. Well I guess I should tell you a little bit about myself. I live in Bradenton, FL and Im 17 years old (will be 18 in september). I am a major computer geek, especially when it comes to Macintosh, and by the way i posted this using my 12 in iBook. I am also a linux nut. And for those of you who don't know what linux is, and you know who are, is an open source code operating system that competes with Microsoft Windows, so to speak. I am also a big fan of the Scion xB. Well I would love to tell you more about myself but I must really get going. More on me tomorrow, hopefully. Peace out yall. ~K-Evil
