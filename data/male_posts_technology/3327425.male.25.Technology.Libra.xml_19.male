My new (well, not so new anymore, but new in the sense that not everything is complete) has been taking alot of my spare time.  My wife, Crystal, and I are trying to get a lawn grown, as well as some nice landscaping.  Many of my free moments are spent putting landscaping brick down (built two retaining walls and two flower beds using retaining wall brick), and spreading dirt and grass seed.  Not to mention little things here and there (like a flag pole, planting a new plant, etc).  We attempted to go on vacation in the middle of June, which was cut short due to the passing of my grandmother.  We arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday morning, received the news via a phone call Sunday morning, and flew out Monday (spent ALL day Monday in airports and airplanes due to delays).  We are going to head back out there to visit my sisters the first week of August.  I've also become increasingly busy at work.  I've somehow managed to manage two projects, develop a third, support 4 others, and pitch in with support for yet another one.  For all the geeks: please note that UPDATE statements generally require a WHERE clause - learned that lesson the hard way today.  So there's my not-much-of-an-excuse.  I will try to be a little more up to date in the future.
