I think it's some kind of conspiracy with it getting darker earlier, somewhere old father time is laughing his ass off as he increments every second by just a little bit when we are at work.  Has anyone else been besieged by those little fuckers running around town, whining "Penny for the guy?" I wouldn't mind normally but they started this weeks ago. There was about twenty of the little bastards in New Street the other day as I was walking home. Twenty. They all chanted their chorus as I walked past, and motioned to their "guy" which was rather pathetic to say the least - basically a cushion with a smiley face drawn on it. I mean really, where are the young entrepreneurs of tomorrow going to come from? If they had any sense they'd spend a day making a guy each, and position themselves around key areas of St Helier in a pincer movement. But no, twenty of them and a damp cushion. A friend of mine got busted for selling porn videos at school. He was 11. THAT'S enterprising.  So what's the script this weekend then? Well.. tomorrow night I am out with my work mates for a triple birthday bypass, and Saturday night it's another mate's birthday bash at a golf club. (I mean a actually place that hosts golf, I don't think we'd all fit in a nine iron). It's going to have live music, canapes, sumo wrestling in big suits and I can't wait.   The Blogger gods sent me my free Blogger hoody as they have hosted Toaster Files for so long and Google just bought them. Yay.
