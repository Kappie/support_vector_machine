These days it's quicker There's little to no wait False happiness is only temporary Before it's burned to the ground. We, collectively have encountered this new phenomenon That bars us from the very hopes and aspirations that keep us going. This is the strongest weight imaginable Plummeting from the top of the Twin Towers Only to fall on our shoulders.  It becomes a contest of who can catch that weight without collapsing, And that ability is not judged by physical strength. I long for the day that those who distribute pain so readily, so generously Will get a heaping spoonful of what we have been feeling For all eternity.  I ponder my possibilities Because this is not a game anymore You have to fight to live, through constant discomfort.   When wild animals are backed into corners, How do they respond?
