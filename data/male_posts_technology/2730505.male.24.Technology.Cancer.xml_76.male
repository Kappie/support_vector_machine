They did a decent enough job that it didn't really bother me that much.  They played Ozzie, Korn and Disturbed to name a few.  Beers were still a buck so that was a bonus.  Played darts, lost, won, lost.  Yeah, losing the touch here.  More practice needed.  We then decided to play some pool.  I haven't played pool for a while so the first few games were really terrible.  I couldn't even draw the damn ball back to set up a shot for the next ball.  We met a couple of girls.  Melissa and Joanne (I think) they were nice and friendly.  They were good at pool so it was good that we spilt them up.  John and Joanne and Melissa and me.  I'm still a guy so these girls had to be somewhat cute to keep my attention.  Melissa was this little petite latina girl with short brown hair a little above her shoulders, brown eyes a triangle shape face, skinny and just very little.  She looked young too.  It looked like she was about 17 but she was really 25 with a 5 year old son.  Joanne was this short Filipina girl with a bunch of curves.  She was also not that bad looking.  She knew Tagalog so it was pretty cool to speak in the native tougne at a bar to a stranger.  They really didn't stay long because one of them had a class in the morning.  So on the last game Joanne bought everyone a round and a shot of Kamikazi each.  That was such a pussy shot.  Anyways, took the shots and said the good byes and that was my night at 602.  It was alright, not great, not bad.
