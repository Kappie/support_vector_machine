I will relay this to help you as the reader learn from our experiences here in MOGworld. These entries will appear when necessary.   The very first entry is: "What I've learned from Mike "The Kidd" Hess"  I have learned to never go into bars my siblings frequent and try to namedrop them when my friends and I can't get served because we are drunken douches. And if you want to get kicked out of said bar (the best pub in NYC) just say to the bartender: "BUT I'M IN THE AGGRESSION!"  This does not work. You have been learned.  F
