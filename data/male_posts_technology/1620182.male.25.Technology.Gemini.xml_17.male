In addition to that meeting, I've also managed to eat lunch, arrange for a ride to the BMW dealer after work, and took a training course in "Mutual Respect."  
 
 The training was the best part.  Basically, it tried to get the point across that you shouldn't be an a$$hole at work.  Duh.  The funny part is that my team seems to break just about every rule in the book (as far as ethnic jokes are concerned), yet I think we're one of the closest knit groups in the company.  We have one girl from Ukraine, a guy from Russia, a Greek guy, one guy from Hong Kong, one from India, one who's half white, half Chinese, one fully Chinese guy, one black guy, and one white American guy, all managed by a guy from India.  It doesn't get much more United Nations than that.  But it's good, and we have fun with it.  We experience and share each other's cultures as much as possible, and I think we work much better as a unit because of it.
 
 Okay, back to the doomsday meeting...
