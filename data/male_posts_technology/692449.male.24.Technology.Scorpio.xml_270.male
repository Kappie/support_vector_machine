I've managed to calm down a lot in the past couple of days and I think that everyone around me would agree that that is a good thing. In other news I finely got off my ass and joined a gym I hope to become super buff or at least in some sort of shape. I'm planning to go out to La during the 5th and 6th of december to go visit my sister and jon. That should be a great time. I think it will also be nice just to get out of albq for a while.
