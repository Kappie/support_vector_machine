I caught part of their set on one of the many stages here at summerfest and I have to say, they rule.  After kicking butt on their stage they came and cleaned up on ours.  One of the guys made it to the finals of our Soul Caliber tournament.  Actually it was one of our more interesting tournaments.  We had a boyfriend/girlfriend fighting it out for the finals.  Now thereâ€™s a tough one.
