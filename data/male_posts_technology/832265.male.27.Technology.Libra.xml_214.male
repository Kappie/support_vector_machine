On Friday, I was in downtown San Francisco, about a block away from Union Street, in a crush of a thousand people swarming up and down Powell Street.  It was a Castro at Halloween type crowd - intoxicated and frenzied.  Families of four or five people were struggling to stay together and would call out the names of their favorite stores they pushed past.
