After his talk he offers question time.  One little boy puts up his hand and George asks him what  his name is.  "Billy."  "And what is your question, Billy?"  "I have 3 questions... First, why did the USA invade Iraq without the support of  the UN?  Second, why are you President when Al Gore got  more votes?  And third, whatever happened to Osama Bin  Laden?"  Just then the bell rings for recess. George Bush informs  the kiddies that they will continue after recess.  When they resume George says,  "OK, where were we? Oh that's right question time. Who has a question?"  Another little boy puts up his hand. George points him out  and asks him what his name is.  "Steve"  "And what is your question, Steve?"  "I have 5 questions... First, why did the USA invade Iraq without the  support of the UN?  Second, why are you President when Al Gore got more  votes?  Third, whatever happened to Osama Bin Laden?  Fourth, why did the recess bell go 20 minutes early? And fifth, what the fuck happened to Billy?"
