Got there around 10pm last nite and we were number 682 and 683 :D  After marking off our terrirtory in the queue we head off to find some food, eventually got some chinese takeaways from wimbledon high street, ate them off Perry's 4x4's bonnet.... not a bad way of keeping the food warm :D btw they charged us 20p for each disposable chopsticks!!!! Sorry for the blurry pic, my hands were slippery after all the greasy house special chow mein :)    It was raining a little we realised we got nothing to sit or sleep on so we went to the 24hr store, got some bin bags, stick them together using some tapes and build us a huge sheet of waterproof cover. Back in the queue around 12 and it was damn cold!!! my philly t-shirt blanket and grape werent really enough to keep warm, probably managed a couple hr sleep at most but it was fun though, havent slept outdoor for god knows how long..... Here is another pic taken around 430am this morning, it just became bright (at 430am in the morning!!), so this is the infamous wimbledon queue on a people's sunday.    I am so tired, will finish the write up of the main event tomorrow, so stay tuned!!
