The heart of the system is a programmable Lego "brick" known as the RCX (although other versions exist including the simpler Scout and even simpler MicroScout). This brick contains a microcontroller which controls three sensor inputs and three motor outputs. Add some motors, sensors and other building elements and you have an actual, programmable robot.  One of the greatest things about Lego Mindstorms is: it's been hacked. You can get replacement firmware and programming tools for the RCX which will allow you to use such things as Forth, C (or C-like), Java and other tools to interface with your robot. There's also a plethora of custom built components to extend your reach beyond what Lego provides.  Best of all, there's a large and vibrant user community with tons of inspiration and ready answers to fiddly questions.  Link:  www.lego.com  and  www.lugnet.com
