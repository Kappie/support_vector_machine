I journeyed again to the unsuspecting, and out of town I might add, Zappin household.  I completed a 5 minute warmup on the ever-backwards elliptical machine then continued on one of the most gruelling 40 minutes sessions ever on the stair climber.  I finished with 15 minutes of rowing which was a good cooldown after that stair climber incident.  Besides a little soreness today, I feel great even after the long run Saturday and the gruelling workout last night.
