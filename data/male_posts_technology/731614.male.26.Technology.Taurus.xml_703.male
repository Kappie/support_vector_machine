This is the second time this month my Aquarius-live-in-Ex-in-the-process-of-finding-another-place-to-live-but-can't-because-SF-is-so-goddamned-expensive-and-he-doesn't-have-a-job-bumstead-wanker set the alarm ahead an hour out of plain and simple (yeah right) goddamned absent-mindedness .  So I woke up at 630 am on no sleep due to tearful breakup/why can't we try again fights the night before, thought it was 730, panicked, skipped all basic hygeine, showed up at work to find the office locked and all the coffee places closed because it was so fucking early!  So I walked the waterfront, stinking and decaffeinated and freezing my unwashed ass off, cursing the end of relationships and the sick means the unconscious uses to say "fuck you".
