You will never seen a Microsoft or AOL exec talking about how cool the their companies or products are, only how useful and easy to use."   Interesting ... could that be true for web sites as well? My artistic side would like to disagree, but in reality anything that you want to appel to the mass market will probably be "utilitarian and dull" and "decidely non-hip", but useful and easy to use.
