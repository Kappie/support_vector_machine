In my day to day work, dealing with n number of issues, I prefer using my notepad (the real one ... one with papers in it...not the windows one) to jot down things to do and other notes.......while I see many others use outlook notes and tasks utilities to do the same.....I personaly find them very counter-productive. But again this might not be the same with every one.  Well the above lines (bold-italic) are written by  urlLink Paul Suffo . Find more about this essay  urlLink here .  tata sachin
