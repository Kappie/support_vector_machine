This problem occurs because one of the following conditions is true: When you ran the Microsoft .NET Framework software development kit (SDK) Setup program or the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET Setup program, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) was not installed.   After you ran the .NET Framework SDK Setup program or the Visual Studio .NET Setup program, you removed and then reinstalled IIS.  To resolve this problem, make sure that IIS is correctly configured to use the .NET extensions. Run the "Aspnet_regiis.exe" administration utility to configure the required application mappings. To do this, follow these steps: Click Start, click Run, type cmd, and then click OK. At the command prompt, type C:\Windows folder\Microsoft.NET\Framework\version\aspnet_regiis.exe -i (where version is the version of the .NET Framework that is installed on your computer), and then press ENTER. Register the Aspnet_isapi.dll file, and then restart IIS. To do this, follow these steps: Click Start, click Run, type regsvr32 C:\Windows folder\Microsoft.NET\Framework\version\aspnet_isapi.dll, and then click OK.  Note Regsvr32 returns the results of the registration.  Click Start, click Run, type iisreset, and then click OK.
