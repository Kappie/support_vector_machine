Anyway, him and his wife Jeanne spoke at our CpR retreats for a few years in a row.  Awesome speakers, but moreso than that, they realized that real ministry happens in relationships, among small groups of people.  So with every retreat, they met with us leaders and : - asked if there were any big issues in our ministry that they could address as guest speakers.  One year, one of our students was killed in a car accident the Friday morning that all the kids left for the retreat.  They listened, and used it during their sessions. - ALWAYS emphasized that we, as the small group leaders, are the catalysts of change.  They always had 3 follow up questions we could take from their talks and use in group time, which was always right after a session. The dynamic that they had as the spoke together was so great.  I haven't listened to the whole message, but I'm sure its a good one.
