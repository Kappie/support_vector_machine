The women dressed in the fashionable crop top and tight jeans with a wide leather belt with some sort of metal adornment on it. Sexy? Some say Yes! Is it still sexy when the tight jeans squeeze a big roll of fat over the top of the belt and the crop top rides up over the roll so that you can see the belly jiggle with every step? This incautious observer says NO!  I know, I know, It seems that I'm buying into the stereotype that the perfect female body doesn't have an ounce of fat on it and belongs in a lingerie magazine, but that is far from the case. My father told me when I was a young boy that  there is no such thing as an ugly woman . I can remember pointing one out when he told me that, but he said that I'd understand one day. That day came and I believe that he was right. But I also understand that they make bigger clothes for bigger people. Fat people can't fit into skinny people clothes and if they try the fat just follows the path of least resistance. Rules to Follow: If you look down and can see bottom hem of your shirt and your belly, but not your belt buckle...Change clothes! When you're dressed to go out in public, try sticking your thumb underneath your belt from the top. If you have to lift a roll out of the way to do it...Change clothes!  People aren't looking at you because you look good, they're looking at you and going "What the hell is wrong with you!?"
