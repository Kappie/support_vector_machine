I think the idea of having a huge loving lug of a dog is just appealing to me. I’ve spent too long without a dog running around my house/yard. The last few dogs I had that were worth mentioning were Pete, a Lab/Bird dog mix and Angel an  urlLink American Staffordshire Terrier  which is a different breed from a  urlLink American Pit Bull Terrier .   Pete: Of all the dogs that I’ve ever wished I could have a clone of would be Pete, named after Pete Rose. This dog would have jumped in front of a moving vehicle to save my life. He was a great dog that I loved so much I cried for 2 days and missed a day of school for. The think is, I hate crying and rarely do. He lived to be 10 years old and died on a cold October night. I compare any dog I’ve ever owned to him and expect them to be at or near the same standards.   Angel: She was actually my brother’s dog before he moved out…the poor girl only lived to be 7 years old. I would have cloned this one too…Angel was a powerhouse of a dog. I remember her getting out of the yard and dragging me down the road after her…I had her around the waist and she dragged me for at least 30 yards. I laugh now at how tough she was and how much fun it was playing football with her. She met an untimely death of heartworms, kidney failure, and tick disease…I cried when I buried her as well.  Anyways, right now I’m looking for the ultimate trio of dogs to own. I want one loveable dog that’s just a big lug, another dog that’s a massive guard/watchdog, and a little shit that instigates everything. As of now I’ve picked the  Deerhound  as my big lug, the  urlLink Boerboel  as my guard/watchdog, and the  urlLink Miniature Schnauzer  as my little shit. I figured the Boerboel is everything I’ve ever wanted in a guard dog, if you read the temperament in the link, that’s what I’m talking about. I’m getting a Deerhound regardless…and my girlfriend had a Miniature Schauzer named Bueller that has more character than 99% of the people I know.  You need one dog that’s your baby, one that’s your strength, and one that’s going to get the other ones into fights.
