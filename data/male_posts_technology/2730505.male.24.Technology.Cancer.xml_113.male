And we shall flow a river forth to thee and teeming with souls shall it ever be. In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti."  MacManus Brothers' Prayer  This is what they would recite when they were about to kill their targets.  It all starts when Connor and Murphy MacManus, two typical Irish Catholics that grew up in the Irish neighborhoods of Boston just having fun.  Along with them is this idiot Rocco, your delivery boy for the local Don.  The three of them hit their favorite pub on Saint Patrick's Day and have a few with friends.  As the night draws to an end, the old bartender, who is suffering from Turret's Syndrome, explains that he is getting evicted from that spot since the Russian Mafia is moving in.  Three of these "soldiers" for the Russian Mob come in and threaten the kick everyone's ass if they didn't leave.  A few words were spoken, drinks were spilled and eventually the Mob's soldiers gets their asses handed to them with a pint of Guinness.  The next day, the mob finds them in their home and were going to kill them.  Well, that's where the self defense comes in.  They pretty much end what the Soldiers started.  Willem Dafoe comes in as Smecker.  A openly gay FBI detective.  Since the two dead bodies found in an alley way came up having connections to the Russian Mob, the became a Federal case.  A few hours later, Smecker is in the police station ranting about the incompetence of the local police department's work when out of the blue, these good natured killers (MacManuis brothers) come walking into the station ready to face whatever charges were against them.  They're not charged.  Self Defense, what a beautiful thing.  Hearing about the big boss of the Russian Mob coming to town to check on things, the brothers go to their local arms dealer and purchase the supplies they need for their new "JOB"  Rocco hears about their plans and wants in.  He becomes and informant to turn in the Yakavetta crime family.  As the Don hears of these recent killing, apparently by the same people since they would cross the people's arms and leave a penny on each eye for toll to cross the river.  This is their signature that these people were bad people and that they deserved to die.  Il Duce is coerced out of retirement (prison) to off these rouge killers and help keep the Crime family alive.  It's going to be sweet to see these two parties meeting up later in the movie.  I liked the movie.  I'm not going to be some sort of snob and say that they were just trying to be a Q. Tarantino.  It's worthy of a rental and just watching it with out any expectation.  Willem Dafoe steals a lot of the scenes a the gay cop.  The most memorable parts of the movie for me were when he was actually with the brother's and Rocco as they took out an assassin's poker game.  He was right there, his words were the sound track to the scene.  It was a recreation and he was "imagining" the people and what was going on during the killings.  The dialouge was funny.  A lot of profanity used.  not too much drama but really in a movie with a lot of violence, who can expect top notch dram acting?  The brothers MacManus were good Flannery and Reedus did the job as the fraternal twins out.  Il Duce I guess is some sort of Irish stand up comic and he did a very good stone face character.  There was a bunch of slo-mo action that were just a little to much.  I personally would have preferred about half less slow motion firefight shooting scenes.  The cinematography could be better.  That's where it really shines as trying to be a Tarantino copycat (oops, I slipped and became a little snobby).  Sometimes it looked as though it was made by an amatuer trying to be artsy professional.  I also had a little something against the sound track of the movie.  It seemed very "techno" and "clubby"  I just thought that since it really wasn't a Matrix or any other sci fi cyber fighting movie, the choice of music wasn't appropriate.  Two Irish Catholic ass kicking twins set in the bad parts of Boston.  It just doesn't go well together.  I would have gone for something a little more rock/rap tracks.  A couple of POD songs would have been better for a couple of fight scenes.  Papa roach would have been a good addition to the sound track.  I'm sure there are a few boston bands that would have been more appropriate.  Hmm, those just started flowing.  I guess that's that.  I really don't know what else to put in here.  Don't get me wrong here.  I really enojyed the movie.  It's just a couple of criticisms that I have for improvements for the second one.  I guess there will be a sequel to the movie.  I don't know how it's going to be any good.  I personally thought it should have ended at one point but they added another 15 minutes to set up the sequel I suppose.  Eh, I'll go see it still, it's titled "Boondocks 2: All Saints Day"  I really don't want to spoil it for everyone so I suggest just rent the damn movie and watch it.   Honestly though, I really can't write a movie review.  This was more or less a half-assed effort to enter something today.
