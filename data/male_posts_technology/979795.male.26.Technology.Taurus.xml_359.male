I realised that the secret was just to get their attention. Worst case scenario is that after 1 hr you still can't find the right way to get everyone's attention that will kinda make one pekchek (frustrated).  I also got the chance to stand in for one of the P4 iClub (something like an IT club). When I first entered, the kids were kinda trying to siam their assignment and they almost immediately started surfing for irrelevant stuff when my HoD (their original teacher in charge) left the room. All the while saying their excuses out aloud for me to hear, and trying so hard to justify why they weren't doin work. Only 1 group concentrated more on gettting their stuff first before they started surfing around for leisure.  Very first thing I did was try to be firm with them and said you MUST get your stuff ready before you can surf for leisure. That didn't seem to work. I was aware that they were surfing for fun out of view. Tried to stop them once or twice but I didn't think it'd be useful.  Me: Now are you sure you are allowed to surf around for Neopets? Kid 1: Yes. Me: (Don't exactly believe them.) Are you sure? Then what did Mrs Hoa tell you to do? Kids 2 and 3: Nothing. Me: Nothing? Are you sure nothing? How can that be? Kid: She just said to look around for fractured fairytales but we cannot find. Me: Now, she has already told you what you need to do. If you want to surf around for other things you can do so after you have done her work.  Some mumbling went on around the groups and they kinda ignored what I had said. But after awhile one of them noticed me typing away. I was actually typing out a question paper for my HoD as she said she wanted it later when she popped back in. It seemed urgent for her so I thought I might as well just spend about 30mins to help her out in it.  Me: (Typing away.) Kid 2: Mr Tan, how come you can type so fast? Me: You just need practice, the more you type the faster you will get. Kid 2: Are you typing the things for the elearning? (Because I had just taught this girl's class 40mins ago.) Me: No, I'm trying to finish typing this for Mrs Hoa, she will be coming back in later. Kid 2: Huuuuuh! Me: Now you see, that's why I've been telling all of you to do your work first before you start doing all these other things. At least finish your work before you start playing around because Mrs Hoa will be coming back later. I dunno what she will say when you cannot finish your work. See, even I am trying to rush her things out first so I can give it to her later. Now, I leave it up to you. If you want to play, you can continue but if she scolds you later, you have no one to blame but yourself. (And I went back to my typing in earnest.)  The kid kinda went balllistic and told the others. That helped because I started to notice them working a bit more though they still kept their leisure sites and homepages opened. But I figured, as long as they were working, it was ok. Slowly one group after another started saying things like, "Mr Tan, I just can't find the fractured fairy tales", "Where to find" and "Cannot find leh". To help them kick start a bit, I decided to help them search around for some link first. Found one and wrote down the URL for them, told them to pass the paper around to the other groups as well to share the resource. Some felt rather surprised and others even admitted that they saw the link but never clicked on it. My answer to that was simply, "Now, the Internet is so big. Everything can be found online. It just takes a little bit of effort." Hahaha the usual Gary Tan's 'everything can be found online' statement.  Slowly group by group they started to come over to ask me for small help here and there like "Mr Tan, my link cannot work" - typo error of course and "Mr Tan, can I print out the stories for the script". Felt happy that the different approach worked. As I went on to finish my own work the girls started surfing around for those ghost websites. But at the same time they'd get so scared of the sound and flash screens of ghosts zooming here and there that they started screaming around in the lab.  Girl 1: Eh come and see this come and see this! Very scary one! Girls: (Started huddling together over this particular PC and staring intently.) What? What? Girl 1: You stare at this for awhile and the ghose very scary one! Girls: (A bit of silence for awhile ...... then suddenly ...) AAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! (and everyone run away from the PC). Me: Goodness what on earth are you doing? Girls: Mr Tan Mr Tan, very scary. You come and see. (Another says,) Ya Ya Mr Tan come and see. Very scary ghost. I dare not clost the window now. Me: (thinking to myself) Is it really so scary? Wah if I also get shocked then it'd be so 'diu lian' (embarassing). Me: (walks over feeling a bit curious) What is it?  Apparently it was some website with tons of flash based screen shots and animations of the supernatural. Some looked really faked though. But it still made the girls scream. Anyway the girls showed me quite a few flash screen shots and some of them were preview shots of horror movies. I even saw one of 'The Eye 2'. It seemed scary enough though, but with so many kids making so much noise and all that, it was kinda an anticlimax. After awhile they got kinda bored with trying to scare me with these flash sites.  Girl: How come you not scared one huh Mr Tan? Me: Aiyo, how to get scared. Everytime I watch the things you are all around me screaming into my ear before the thing even appears.  Anyway, towards the end of class my HoD came back and they did manage to show her the work they did. She seemed satisfied enough to leave them for another 15 mins to surf around for fun. Aiya ... kids lah, harmless to give them a bit of R I suppose. Anyway I did enjoy the company as I worked on my company reports that afternoon.  The final class that I took after that was a Pri 3 class and they were so inquisitive that it was quite enjoyable teaching them as well. One thing I realised, the P3-4s enjoy doing quizzes. They kinda treat them as games. So I'd promise them I'd let them go through the quizzes if only they'd listen and let me finish up fast so they'll have more time to work on the quizzes. Turns out there wasn't enough time and I still had to make them do a survey. But they treated the survey as a quiz and some even enjoyed doing these. Haiz ... kids can be so naive sometimes. But what they don't know won't hurt them lah.
