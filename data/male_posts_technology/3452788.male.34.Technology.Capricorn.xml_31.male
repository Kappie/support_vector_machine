Those are relatively simple tasks, but the real challenge is in the disassembly and reassembly.  All the parts fit back together, eventually; I only had to use super glue twice; the keyboard still works; and I only have 3 screws left over.  I think the pointy-mouse-q-tip stick was broken before, and they are unusable anyway, so that is no big loss.  Anyway, it ran successfully, and that's all that counts.  BTW, Damn I'm good at working on computers.  No programming or design, just taking the tools and leaning to use (and repair) tham, and teach others how to do the same.  Maybe I should see what it takes to teach at CR, the local junior college.  Music:  Led Zeppelin IV, my favorite LZ album. Books:  Anything by David Baldacci.  He is a good suspense storyteller.  No therapy yesterday, C. was sick, so they said wait until next week.  I didn't have much to say anyway, I've pretty much said everything here lately.  Maybe I can just print the blog and leave early for my next appointment.
