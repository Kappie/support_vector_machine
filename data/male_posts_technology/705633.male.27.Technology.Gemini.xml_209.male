I have just returned home from a hard day at work, and I am totally bollocked as I got three hours sleep this morning and I woke up still drunk!  Last night I decided to let myself be tempted out on the piss with the crew and Princess Kate (lovely girl), so I headed out for a night of booze, birds and..um.....bloody town. Anyways, heres the rundown of the night........... I met up with the guys at Sports Bar, and to my suprise I even got to finally meet Princess Kate! Now I happen to already know a few Canadian people and it was a pleasure to meet yet another. I did my best to be myself, although it was bloody hard because going out in town is very very very different to going out to the Splash!! I had to make sure I didn't hurt anyone in a whirlwind of headbanging, and I had to do that sort of townie style dancing later on in the night (which I can usually pull off, although in a sort of mocking way....BITE ME! Libbies!). I digress, anyway I got on really well with Kate and I think we got on sound. So there we all were in Sports Bar when suddenly I see Brett (Danger) working behind the bar, well shock horror! We all let the drinks go back easy and generally had a good time whilst gawping at the local talent. At one point I spyed Danger walking back to the bar with about fifteen empty glasses stacked in his arms, now at this point I was presented with a very hard moral dilemma!!!  Do I:  a) Watch him struggle through the throngs of people clapping in support of his efforts,  b) Ask him if he needed assistance and then refusing with a big grin on my face, c) Pinch a passing girls arse and claim it was Danger which would result in a hefty slap causing him to drop the glasses, (or, and this was my favourite), d) Weave my way between the masses of people in pursuit of Danger and then when level with him give an accidental push causing him to fall and once again breaking the glasses.  Well being as I'm not a total asshole, I decided to stick with plan A.  So, after a while we all left on our way to Follies D'amour (translated to Follies D'meat market). Actually it was cool as I saw a load of people that I hadn't seen in a while, whilst having a laugh with my mates, which afterall, is what it's all about. We drank and danced the night, and some of the morning away, and watched several fights (a sad happening involving two townies batter the 'Tommy H' out of each other!). At around 2am Custard and I left and walked home. Nothing much happened after that, apart from having to wake up at six to go to work!  Um......well fuck this, I need a shower, cya all.
