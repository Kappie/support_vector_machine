Google almost has the entire internet cached up. On occassions more than one, google's cache has got me content from site's that have been pulled off hook long long time back. Why would google ever want to cache or rather duplicate the entire internet locally ? For all we know, they could be testing all their fancy algorithms on the local caches before they are published to the world. But I am really happy that they have the cache such that it is accessible from the outside world too. Keep it up folks.  Now, when will MSDN be indexed without a hitch ? They make it a point not to let my bookmarks have a slightly longer life !!
