People take pills for headache, diabetes, heart problems, why not brain problems?  But there is still a stigma (doctor's word) that still lingers about psychotherapy.  I admit that I feel somewhat embarassed or awkward about it, when logically I know that is silly.  A common phrase is "chemical imbalance".  that word 'imbalance' in particular has connotations that go back hundreds of years in the English language, as well as unstable, unbalanced, manic (like maniac). (just an observation.)  I wish it were as easy as the commercial with the sad egg under the rain cloud, then after taking pills the cloud goes away and the egg happily rejoins the other eggs for some eggciting activity.  When I see that, I'm thinking omlettes.
