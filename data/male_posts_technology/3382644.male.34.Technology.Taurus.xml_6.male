Of course it will be no limit and all I play is limit games.  So I've been bouncing between Royal Vegas and Party Poker tonight trying to get as much NL action as I can.  For play money of course.  Here's the results:  $50-$5 Limit 2nd Place $10-$1 NL 3rd Place $10-$1 NL 6th Place $10-$1 NL 3rd Place  I'm signed up for a multi-table limit game on Poker School right now.  It starts in six minutes.  I've never played multi-table before.  Should be fun.  I'll let you know how it turns out.  Indiana Slim
