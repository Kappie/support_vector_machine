Fuck the neighbors with their hateful stares...  and their damn suggestions... how bout this, You can go take care of your yard and live your perfect lives... But not ME... I will not mow the lawn, I WILL let the forest grow, and take my garden... Let nature do it's thing, I care not...  Yesterday I had my last party, much to my neighbors delight I suppose... too much fucking shit for them to deal with...  Is it too hard to live this life without boundries? Can you find a boundry that you have and won't cross that seems infintile? You can't go to a nude beach because why? You can't say the word "fuck" because why?  Are you listening to what others say? Can you not challenge your ideas? Will you not challenge your ideas?  Who says you're going to hell? I'm pretty sure, last time I checked, that was up to God.  peace
