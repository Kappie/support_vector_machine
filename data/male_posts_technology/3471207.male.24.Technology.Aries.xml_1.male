At 1015pm i was on my computer with a direct connection to the power supply and with my cable modem on. Was chatting with some people online and working on the website and reading a blog and halfway into it, the lights went off, my notebook switched off and everything was black. Immediately, i looked to my window to check if the other block was hit. Yup, it was. And i then went to the balcony window to see whether my neighborhood was affected too. Yup. I took in the scene. It was soooo amazing and awesome. Come on, how many times do you experience such a major blackout in Singapore? Even the street lamps were shut off and the only light i saw for the first part were from the vehicles down below and some isolated light in the distance. Then slowly, i started to see dots of light appear in random units in the opposite blocks. People were lighting their candles and turning on their torch lights. I tried to take a photo of the whole neighborhood but it was in vain..all i got was a black photo..hahha..guess i have to get a better camera or change some settings. Anyway, it was almost as if the end of the world was here. Well, at least a glimpse of what would happen. Then i went online using my dialup and notebook battery. Thankfully i still have a backup internet line..haha. And i checked to see whether it was an isolated event or a national catastrophe. nope. it just affected some parts of singapore. Ok, so it's not that much of a catastrophe..thoughts of the possibility of terrorists being the mastermind came up. Well, as i've said, this is just a small glimpse of what would really happen when God comes again the second time to earth. All eye will see him and he will be accompanied with tens of thousands of angels.  Apart from the blackout, today was quite a fulfilling day too. I had chance to learn more of php web programming language and do some debugging. I was stuck in how to configure the emailing feature from the website. I realised that the saying "you learn best when you struggle" holds true. I did learn alot today. Anyway, Joel wanted the song "Searching" by Joe Satriani so i sent it to him. Earlier i had sent him a song by Steve Vai. I wonder why he didn't like it.hehe. Anyway, today doesn't sound of much activity, tomorrow is going to be a busy day for me. In fact, wednesday nights seem to be the hottest day and time of the week. I have friends playing tennis on wednesdays and i can't go because i have to give bible study to Andrew on wednesdays. Furthermore, for this week, we have a meeting this wednesday night to discuss the young adult ministry with pastor. And lastly, i was supposed to check with one of the voice of prophecy correspondence course gradute whether she was free for us to visit her on wed night to pass her the certificate of completion personally. Oh well, i decided there was only one way to solve this. I decided to bring my bible study earlier, probably late afternoon and then i'll go to the meeting at night. As for the tennis, i have to forgo it and have been forgoing it all this while. For the visit, i'll arrange to meet on saturday afternoon instead. Hai..so many things to do even when i'm unemployed. I can't believe how i'll survive if i was employed.   Another thing is, while i was doing the website halfway, my friend suddenly msned me and asked for help. She seemed desperate so i had to help her. She was in paris and lost her luggage when she was trying to get off the train. She had a huge bag and a hand carried one with the laptop inside. So when she tried to get off the train, she put the handcarried one on the platform and then swung back to get the huge luggage. unfortunately, the door closed too fast and she and her big luggage were stuck in the train with the hand carried bag outside. Oh well, not only was her laptop in there but her demand draft was there. It's like a cheque. So i helped her call UOB to check if anybody else could cash in the cheque. Thankfully only she could cash it in. So that's not so bad..now the only worry is the laptop. Anyway, hope things will get better.
