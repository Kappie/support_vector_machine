As opposed to declaring that Apple is on a death march, they are encouraging the company to abandon the Macintosh to pursue the iPod and give up on enterprise computing.  In the world of rampant vested interests (which is today) Steve Jobs appears to me to be one of only a handful of strategic innovators.   Strategic innovation is the only method that can sustain a firm in this new market environment. Vested interests are the counter weight to the innovator.   Keep up the excellent work Mr. Jobs, they'll get it some day.  Oh, the comment about the enterprise will be certainly be those individuals with vested interests next biggest mistake.
