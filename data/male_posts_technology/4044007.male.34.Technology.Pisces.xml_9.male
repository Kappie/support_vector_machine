These same airports that now tell employees to shuffle people through at a faster pace to keep the line moving instead of causing delays for more secure checks? We keep hearing we are safer, but somehow I find no comfort in that. Even going to NY Grand Central you see the national guard there, but they really aren't looking out for anything? It didn't appear so when I was there. They were more interested in talking with other workers or security. OK, they may have been discussing something of importance, but anyone could still walk in there and blow it up. All they would have to do is wear the bomb and be willing to die for a cause. Now who would be silly enough to do that? It wouldn't even have to be grand central it could be on a train, and why not hit a few key bridges on I95 and 15? That would put a huge blow on CT/NY's transit systems and make life really unpleasant for a lot of people. It's easy to say we are safer than we were on 9/11, but I want the proof. We won't have that until these new systems are tested by another attack.
