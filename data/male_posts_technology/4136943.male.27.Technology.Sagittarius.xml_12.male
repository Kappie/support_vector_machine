Anyway back to Good Eats, I think it is a great show - well written (usually), well produced, well shot (camera-wise) and just good overall on many levels.  If you aren't familiar with the show, it airs on the  urlLink Food Network . New episodes are on Wednesdays at 9:00 PM (EST) but there are usually several repeat episodes several times throughout the day. It is hosted by the funny and talented Alton Brown.  It is a cooking show...but not a "normal" cooking show. They don't cook crazy things that you would never eat in an impossibly short time (i.e. caviar and oysters with every ingredient already chopped, prepared, measured, and the hosts uses three sets of already prepared food and you basically just watch them mix it). Instead they cook things that most people actually eat or probably would. It is presented in a such a way that anyone can understand: they explain the science and food interactions behind the cooking, how to choose the freshest/best food, how to prepare it, and what to do if (when) you screw it up. I have learned a lot about cooking methods, and even made a couple of recipes I saw on the show (the macaroni  cheese was awesome). I definately recommend watching it.
