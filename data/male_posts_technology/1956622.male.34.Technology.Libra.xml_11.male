According to the   X   Karissa was cranky and having a bad hair day.  What probably happened was that the   X   had a big night planned with her boyfriend and was trying to get Karissa to bed early.   I say that because yesterday was the   X's   birthday!  So today I called and did not get to talk to Karissa much she was busy watching cartoons and eating pickles so needless to say daddy was not a person of interest today.  Much to my dismay my   X   was available (I was hoping she would have choked on her birthday cake) which I must say anymore is really a disappointment anytime I call!
