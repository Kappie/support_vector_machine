There is a new version called  urlLink Truck Dismount  which takes the premise of Stair Dismount (define a few variables, launch the dismount and see how much damage the body takes) but instead of stairs uses a moving truck and a few ramps!  I really shouldn't be playing this at work, but it's terribly addictive.  It has a good mix of complexity and ease of entry.  The complexity is a time sink because you keep tweaking things trying to create bigger crashes and more damaging launches.
