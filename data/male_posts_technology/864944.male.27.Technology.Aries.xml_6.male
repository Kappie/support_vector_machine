The guy who invented it (and has the old data tapes to prove it) said he made it up to convey the fact that he was saying something in jest when he was posting on bulletin boards.    As we all know many times in text, a joke doesnt quite come across very well.   Thanks to that guy for inspiring a whole lexicon for emtions via  short text.   ---  Ben Folds' new live album is coming out on October 8th.  The cover features the audience showing him the bird as he recoils.  The picture is pretty funny, and even more so because I was at the show where he came up with it, and somewhere (out of frame I think) I too am flicking off Ben.   If you have never heard Ben Folds, he is an AMAZING piano player.  His music is deffinitely rock, and his old group Ben Folds Five also featured bass and a drum.  His lyrics are usually very interesting, and when you see him live, he will sometiems explain them.  They all come from some story in his life, or the lives of his close friends.  Warning.. he does swear.  ANyway.. the album cover can be seen at the link below.. though dont bother trying to purchase the album from the store there.. their website stinks and I cannot get it to work right.  (maybe by the time you click the link it will work)   urlLink http://www.sonymusicdirect.com/SMDProdDetails.asp?ProdID=83073=1669=2670676   -----  About a year ago, I took my digital camera on a ski trip to Stowe.  After the cold, the camera seemed to not work properly.  I was convinced that I broke it, and after several attempts to use it, its behavior was erratic.  I was pretty upset as you can imagine.   THe way to fix it would be to mail it to Kodak and have them do some presumably expensive work on it, if it could be saved at all.  Needless to say, i procrastinated on sending it and spending any money on a camera that I had already spent a considerable amount on.    On a whim last night, I took out my digital camera, which has laid dormant, threw in some new batteries (and yes I had tried new batteries before) and she worked perfectly!  I was more than siked.  I am guessing the camera had time to let any moisture inside it finally evaporate totally.  YAY!  So expect some pictures of me, chris, our cat, and my friends at sometime in the future.  -----  Lastly, a big congratulations goes out to my friends Ryan and Jodi Miller in Ohio, they moved back to Ohio from Boston in order to be closer to family as they started their own.  And on last Monday, Jodi gave birth to a healthy baby boy.  Jabe  was 8 lbs, 14 oz and this pic is the little man, Jodi and Jabe.  ;p  (j/k ryan ;p)     Congratulations guys, and we miss you too!
