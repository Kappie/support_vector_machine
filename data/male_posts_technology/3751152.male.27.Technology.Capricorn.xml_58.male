The interesting thing about our latest group is that they are all women- quite an abnormality for engineering.  The three women are quite different.  2 Austrians and 1 Swede.  One is blonde (the Swede), one is brown-haired, and one is blue-haired!  The latter is quite unusual for engineering!  So now, my office, which has until this year, been "male-only", suddenly has more women than it does men!  Now, you would think with a bunch of women, the stereo type would be that the women would be talking non-stop with each other, and I would be able to get no work done, but these women barely talk to each other.  I took them to lunch today, and barely a word out of any of them to the other...I hope the ice eventually melts between them.  Its also interesting noting the differences in how they behave.  The Swedish woman feels much more comfortable in talking to me that the Austrian women - she also eats much more but is the thinnest.  I have yet to see the Austrian women have more than a simple cup of soup for lunch.    With one of the Austrians, I could not even get a smile from her. So I had to resort to desperate measures and blackmail her with ---- Gummi cola bottles!  At least that got me a smile from her :)    Anyways, at least the women are a nice break from the bald German man I used to share the office with ;)
