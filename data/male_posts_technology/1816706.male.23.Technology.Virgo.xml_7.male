Today I walked to, and hiked, Manoa Falls which is in the mountains a little, short little hike to a cool little waterfall.  This was a 20 mile roundtrip hike, and only 2 of those miles was the actual hike!!!  The rest was getting there.  But it was a nice hike, my feet hurt though, need to get some hiking boots, my tennis shoes are brown.  I am uploading pics to the website now so be sure to check those out.  Put in a section for each of the two hikes and then some misc. pictures.  If you click on the link at the top in the pics section that says last uploaded (I think) it will show you the latest.  Didn't do much else after the hike, applied for some jobs, went to the beach, they were showing a movie on the beach tonight, pretty sweet huh.  Life is good when I can bitch about my feet hurting from the hikes I've been going on in Hawaii.  Take care.
