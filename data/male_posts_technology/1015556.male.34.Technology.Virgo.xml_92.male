The  urlLink second  installment of his series talks about the reluctance of one of the girls to actually leave and take her freedom.  It's an interesting set of observations that talk about freedom from bondage, but also acceptance when one is free. It's a whole realm of society that we don't have to deal with here in the US, and a serious opportunity to reach people that are literally captive.  Christ came to set all of us free, in order that we would be giving Him more glory.   I wonder what kind of spiritual background this guy has.
