Windows Explorer in Longhorn has a large XP-style menu on the left side and a completely unnecessary menu under the toolbars.  Combined with the  *gigantic*  back and forward buttons that are permanently docked at the  /very/  top of the window, this leaves very little space for the actual file view.  To top it all off, the address bar is actually visible by default (was not in XP) but it looks horrific; yet it does have a semi-cool drop-down list for each directory/subdirectory.  The quicklaunch, system tray, and clock now reside in their own gigantic (~5-icon width wide) toolbar on the right side of the screen.  The clock is overly large.  When you click on the clock a much larger clock will popup.  The taskbar and new  ugly  sidebar take forever to load.  The sidebar can be minimized, but then there is no way to see your quicklaunch, system tray, and clock....  What a shame.
