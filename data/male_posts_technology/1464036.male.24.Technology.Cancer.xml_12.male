It hasn't necessarily been us, but the stress from our jobs and the wedding itself has added up.  I would be the first to say that I didn't think weddings were stressful.  I WAS WRONG.  It is hard for me, the most left-brained person, to adjust to paying a great deal for one day.  I've adjusting to the idea that it is only money, but the love that I have for Christie is forever.  2. Work has been pretty stressful.  I know that I won't be able to make as much money as I'm making anywhere else and will have a hard time finding a more loyal/generous employer.  I've been doing a lot of custom crystal reports, data conversions, scripting and phone support.  I had to go to Eagle Pass this past Monday and Tuesday and the client may not even pay the bill.  I'm tired of clients who think that they can be friendly while I'm doing the job and then turn on us as soon as the job is completed.  3. Life.  I've officially got venous stasis.  The blood is not flowing back up my legs like it is supposed to.  I've got swelling and blood clotting going on in my legs.  Not fun.  I'm trying to work out but it hurts to use my legs.  I'm seriously considering the gastric bypass surgery.  I'll be updating this again soon.  ILY
