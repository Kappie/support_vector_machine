One was "pulcheezi", which was nothing but,  our "thaayam"(if u've not played, remember the game which the pandavars played  lost their wife to dhuriyodhanan).  i saw another game too...it was "Mancala", which is nothing but our "pallaankuli"(remember this??!!!). So all the games which has been existing for ages in our country, has been existing in other coutries too, in some form or the other!!  Last weekend was a longer one. July 4th , American Independence.....It was a long time we partied. So we hosted a dinner on friday.   We get fire works in America only around july 4th. So we've actually stocked a few of them, so that we can use them during Diwali.   spoke to Sashi kala today(our junior). She told me that, her class mate, Madhu has also joined Infy it seems.hey Kavi  Kicha, do u guys know abt that?...  Ganesh, All the best, for your new job.  My younger bro, has got his admission in Anna university, Guindy college of Engg.His discipline being EEE.  Ram anna, u missed the get together. That's so sad!!!   Networking classes...So far so good.....  catch u later this week.... bye
