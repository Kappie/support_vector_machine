The situation with Iraq's debt is tough. It's hard to choose the right course of action for creditor nations.  Creditors are right in that they did not support the war against Saddam, and now they are being forced to pay part of the financial cost of the reconstruction. Iraq is a rich country, they say, and will be able to pay their debts off using future oil revenues.  The United States is right is asking others to share in the financial cost, as they are giving $20 billion or so towards reconstruction. Why should others in the world reap financial reward (i.e. the payback of the loans with interest) from the U.S. treasury?  The people of Iraq of course would like to be a strong country again. With hundreds of billions of dollars of debt, they would find it hard to stand on their feet. Even if oil revenues could pay back most of this debt, they need money for rebuilding roads, fixing buildings, paying salaries, and all of the day-to-day needs.  If not a debt relief, Iraq certainly needs a debt vacation. Creditor nations should perhaps consider (a) giving up any interest they feel they are owed - turn all loans into 0% loans retroactively, and (b) give Iraq 5 years of no payments, so that it can spend its money on its people.  I feel the creditors deserve to get their money back, but there should be some relief for the people of Iraq. Noone (not even the United States) should benefit from the situation they are in.
