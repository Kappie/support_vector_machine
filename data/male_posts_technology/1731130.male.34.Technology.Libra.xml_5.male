Allow me to demonstrate:   You're at a restaurant with six of your co-workers and it's time to divide the bill. One of the party pulls out a pocket calculator to help. At this point you say in a derisive tone "that's not a calculator.  This  is a calculator!" and whip this monster out.  It's just struck me as odd that not only would at least one of my co-workers take a pocket calculator to a restaurant, but that I would have a better one with me.  I have always subscribed to the "use a sledgehammer to crack a walnut" school of technology and this can best be demonstrated via the Texas Instruments Voyage 200 PLT Calculator. It does more than add up. It graphs, it does calculus, it solves quadratic equations it even allows you to download and install  new applications  (including games) for it's  operating system!    I use mine to add.  Link:  TICalc.org
