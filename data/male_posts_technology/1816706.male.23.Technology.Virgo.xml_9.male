This hike (Kalalau) is one of the most famous in the world, it goes on the Na Pali coast which is the North-west side of Kauai where it can only be reached by foot or touring by helicopter or seeing it from sea by boat.  I hiked 32 miles out of a possible 33 miles round trip.  It is some of the most beautiful scenery ever and some of the beaches along the way are only reachable by hiking there, it is a serious hike, one of the best in the world, it changed my life.   Day 1 – 20 Miles  The alarm went off at 4:45am and after a shower and packing or stuff in the car, me and Thomas drove up to the North Shore where we parked our car at a campsite a mile from where the hike starts.  One mile to the hike itself, got on the hike about 7am.  The first mile in was pretty much all uphill  a few switchbacks but I had plenty of energy right off the bat so it was pretty easy.  Next mile was pretty much downhill and not too bad.  At the 2 mile marker there is a nice little beach (Hanakapiai Beach) which is really bad ass, but horrible for swimming because the current is so bad.  There is a hike to the side here to a set of waterfalls, rightly named Hanakapiai Falls, it was 2 miles in, 2 miles out, first mile easy, 2nd was a little rocky, but not too bad, nice waterfalls.  I fell in the stream, right before the hike to the waterfalls getting my shoes and socks nice and wet.  I fell in another stream on the way to the falls, and Thomas fell in one on the way back, off to a great start.  The hiking boots I bought, and you NEED hiking boots, were a size 14, a size to small for me, so by the time we were heading back from the falls – about 6 miles in, the blisters had already started.  Back from the falls we had 4 miles to the next camping point which had been closed due to Malaria, but it wasn’t that bad when we went.  Those 4 miles weren’t too terribly tough.  A lot of switchbacks and some elevation change but great views of the coast the entire way down, we ducked in and out of the forest and being on the side of the cliff, some bamboo forests, eventually arriving at Hanakoa.  There is a short little half a mile hike here to the side to see a set of waterfalls which is supposedly nicer than the first which we opted to skip the first day and we were going to hit it on the way back but I was never able to find it.  We stopped here for about half an hour, having a dip in the stream, and a little bit of lunch – bread.  The next bit of the hike was 4 miles again, and described by all books as the most difficult.  In all honesty, it was exhausting, but I don’t know if I thought it was the toughest part.  The worst thing about it was having shoes that didn’t fit so well and numerous blisters starting, and when I say blisters, it was like someone cut off the back part of my heel, pretty rough.  There was one set of switchbacks all going up hill, probably 3 miles into that portion where I thought it might never end.  It was really strenuous for about 30 minutes, it seemed like a lot more, but was probably a lot less, but was richly rewarded with a brilliant view of the coast at the top.  These 4 miles were really cool though, most of it was out in the open on the side of the mountain, sometimes we had to grip the wall and go sideways the path got so narrow and the drop offs were so high, but the views were indescribable, just absolutely breathtaking.  This part of the trail was also quite dry, but the ocean was a perfect aquamarine, blueish, can’t even describe it, the pictures won’t do it enough justice, you have to see it to believe it.  Eventually we got to the 10 mile marker, which for us had been 15 miles and we ended at Kalalau stream.  The last mile or so we had some naked people hiking behind us, and we saw loads of goats.  At the end there were goats everywhere!  I also saw my first centipede, maybe a millipede on the hike.  At the stream, we took another hike 2 miles in to this big pool located in the stream.  It was cool, but as exhausted as I was and as late in the day as it was, it wasn’t worth it for 4 miles round trip.  The last mile to the beach was absolutely mad.  It was all down hill on slippery gravel and odd shaped ground, plenty of place to lose your footing and screw up your feet, which I did.  You could see the beach the whole way down, but I swear it wasn’t getting any closer.  Eventually I got there and it was spectacular.  The beach was almost completely isolated, there were people camping there but I didn’t see many.  Maybe 5 or 6 couples, 20 people total?  The sand was so powdery I would sink down when I stepped in it, there was a waterfall at one end of the beach where fresh water was available.  The water was crystal blue and sandy on the bottom.  I caught sunset that day too which was a gorgeous redish pink that filled all the clouds with all sorts of shades and made the beach almost glow.  I slept on the beach that night, and although I slept pretty badly, the scenery was great.  Towering green cliffs in the background, beautiful beaches all around, and millions of stars shining so bright it would light up the beach.  Dinner was beef jerky, goldfish, and protein bars.     Day 2 – 9 miles  The next morning we swam in the water for a bit, and thought about going to this other beach – Honopu which the only way to get there is by doing this hike, then swimming around the bend to get there.  I am pretty damn confident in my swimming, but the current was bad, and I certainly didn’t want to kill myself, so I left it alone, maybe for another day.  Got back on the road about 11am, and just about died the first mile.  All up hill, the sun hitting my back my backpack filled with almost 5 liters of water, plus equipment, it was mentally and physically grueling.  Obviously since I am writing this, I made it, but I’m not quite sure how.  The rest of the day would be like that, just shy of torture, with the most beautiful background imaginable.  There would be 2 more switchbacks uphill the rest of the day that were about as tough as this one, and we took our time, sweat a ton, drank loads of water, and made it back to the 2 mile marker right after sunset leaving us 3 miles for the next day.  Let me tell you about that night on the beach, one of the worst nights, ever.  Fell asleep after some more beef jerky and goldfish and sourdough bread about 8pm.  Sometime in the night, about 10 or 11 it started drizzling rain.  That kind of sucked because we were on the beach, though over a little sand dune, but only in sleeping bags.  We covered our bags so they wouldn’t get wet, then tried to cover up with a poncho a little bit.  The rain let up eventually and I went back to sleep, about 1:30ish, high tide came and wiped out all the tents on the beach filling them with water and soaking all sorts of people, it was quite bad, it got us a little, but nothing too bad… yet.  About 3, another set of huge waves came and this time just ripped right through us, soaking Thomas completely and his sleeping bag.  I got it pretty good, getting my sleeping bag soaked and the sleeves on the shirt, the rest of me was dry, though.  Wet, sandy, a bit cold, and pretty tired, we did our best, as did others on the beach, do fix things up a bit and try and lay some stuff out to dry.  Right as we were finishing, about 4am, the rain starts in again, this time going pretty good.  It rained pretty much nonstop and we sat huddled in our ponchos, until sunrise about 6:30am.  And just as the sun came up, the rain stopped.   Day 3 – 3 miles  Only 2 miles on the trail, which was pretty muddy, and though everyone says don’t hike it when it’s muddy, we had to, and we saw plenty of other people that were too – morons.  It was dangerous, and hurt the hell out of our feet, but eventually we made it, and I have never seen a parking lot look better.  The mile walk back to the car kind of sucked, and after getting to Old Blue (our car) I threw those hiking boots away.  I felt kind of like Kevin Costner in “Dances with Wolves” when at the beginning he has to have the boots cut off his feet, it was pretty bad.  After getting in the car we drove to Safeway to hit up the first aid section, then off to a local beach to clean up, shower, and boy did I smell, brush my teeth, etc.  After that it was on to McDonalds to load up on trash food, my first meal in about 2 ½ days.  Then we headed back to the hostel we were staying at before, dried some stuff out, rested a bit, and repacked our bags, then went off to the airport, caught the end of the World Series (happy to see the Yankees lose) and then back home to good ol’ Honolulu.     *Some side notes about the hike*    The Good:  You will get spectacular views, you will visit beaches that no one else can get to unless they go through what you do.  You will get to experience things that you can experience no where else.   The Bad:   It’s a rough hike, it’s no messing around, and you will hurt during and when you finish.  We heard stories of people faking injuries to get helicopter lifted off the coast, people crying, and others, I believe them all.  It will bring you as far as you’ve ever gone physically and mentally.  I would like to think that I am in pretty good shape, and it was still rough on me – though my hiking boots didn’t help.   Things you should know before you do the hike:   Stretch every day before and during the hike, stretch a lot, stretch all your leg, back, hip, etc. muscles.  I stretched, and it saved me.  Bring loads of water, but also bring iodine tablets to purify stream water, we did, and it was great.  Bring insect repellant, we did, and had no problems.  Bring a tent!  Take about 4 or 5 days to do the hike, don’t try and do all the side trips in one day, you’ll hurt yourself too bad, I’ll take a picture of our feet if you don’t believe me.  Most importantly, get a pair of hiking boots before you do it, the most comfortable pair, and wear them for a month before you go, and don’t fall in the river on the way there – but bring extra socks too.     THE BOTTOM LINE:   This hike changed my life.  For every time I got second place in a swim meet, for every calculus test I didn’t pass, for every girl I spent too much time on, or not enough time on, for every time I didn’t play piano well enough, none of those matter anymore.  Nothing has ever brought be a better sense of accomplishment than this hike, and I think it will be the same for anyone else.  I grew up a couple years on the hike, lost a couple pounds, but nothing has ever changed my life like this.  I can’t describe the feeling that I have in words, but I can go to bed every night thinking, “Well, at least I hiked the Na Pali coast.”  Would I recommend it to anyone else?  Maybe.  That’s a tough question.  You better be in good shape, and prepare yourself for the worst because it’s going to hurt you mentally and physically, probably like you’ve never been hurt before.  I always weigh hikes in how tough it was, and was the pay off worth it.  The pay off was well worth it, I don’t regret one step I took.  Would I do the hike again?  Maybe.  I’d love to go to that beach at the end that you have to swim to, and it’s quite a bonding experience.  I’d probably do the hike again with the same people that I would recommend it too.  If you’re a whiner, or going to complain, don’t even think about going on the hike.  Off the top of my head, I’d tell my Dad, Keith, and Andy Pace to do it, maybe Robby.  This hike had a huge impact on me, it was one of, if not the best thing I have ever done in/with my life.  I could’ve cried at the end of the hike because I was so happy to have done it, so happy to be finished, so happy to have been part of the Na Pali coast.
