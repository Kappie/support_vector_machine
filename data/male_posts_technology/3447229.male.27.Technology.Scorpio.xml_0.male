The main idea of this blog is to offer tips and guidelines to small and medium enterprises regarding ICT.  Having several years of experience in ICT for SME's (check out my  urlLink resume ) I have noticed most SME's are looking for guidance, and have no idea of new trends, what to trust, what's hot and what's not in ICT.  This blog was started in order to guide you...  And for the people who were allready familiar with my former blog : welcome Back !!!
