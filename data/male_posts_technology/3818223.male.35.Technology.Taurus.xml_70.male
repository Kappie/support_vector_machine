I checked their web site to see if they had folded (this is very common in the fiction marketplace), but they appear to be alive and kicking. Only one course of action left to me. The  urlLink Literary Gods  must be appeased! Time to sacrifice something. If I have the Kung Pao Chicken for dinner, will that count?  Only one way to know.
