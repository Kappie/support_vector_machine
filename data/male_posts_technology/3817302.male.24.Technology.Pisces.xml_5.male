These are but a few of the things one could say about the incomparible Dungo Dagbar.    Dagbar is short, even by halfling standards. He has reddish brown curly hair, and not a spot of facial hair. In fact, Gond was quite stingy when handing out hair to the little halfling. He travels in mostly gray outfittings, as he prefers not to be noteworthy.   Dungo hails from the forests of Chondalwood, where he learned his trade from a long line of burglars. His father was a rogue. His mother was a rogue. His grandmother was a roguish Madam. As one can see, Dungo Dagbar had but one choice. To steal stuff.   Dungo considers the Reverend Stumbleduck of the Church of Gond to be his closest confidant. The conversion to Gond almost surely saved the little halfling from falling to the dark side like the Hexblade would have him do. Other close friends are Silvanus the druid, his trustoworthy wolf, the afformentioned Hex, and the mysterious Raven.One of hisother travelling companions include an incessantly good wizard, who, while frustrated by very often, he grudgingly respects. Last but not least is the mysterious asian monk who recently joined their ranks. Dagbar is not sure he understands the monks motivations, but finds him to be a worthy fighting companion.   Dungo is a member of the powerful Night Raptors thieves guild based out of the shady town of Luskan. He is proud to have recently defeated the evil Galimar, and hopefully can expand the guild of the Raptors into Calimport. Nothing would make him happier.   In short, Dungo Dagbar is a spritely man, full of many surprises. To quote the great John F. Kurtzenbaum, "ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can steal from your country."
