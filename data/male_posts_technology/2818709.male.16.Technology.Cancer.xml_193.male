I walked to the driveway, and there was a "warthog"(halo) brown xterra. It's sweet. Fuck the ptcruiser.  Dani and I went to the museum of art. It was...? Werd, yo. The cafe was the funniest part. I swear that there was white stuff floating around in my drink...And they had bread that has a concrete covering. And the people there did not want dani and i to leave. We got done...a LONG time before the check got there. an hour seems like an accurate amount of time. I went to dani's house. It was fun...except for my lack of hearing. Damn you, chel. Don't make dani make those noises. It realllllly hurts my ears. Heh. Anyways, later on, chel came over, and we watched POTC. That movie got better. I don't know how, but i think it's a decent movie now. Could be grammatically. Could be emotionally. No one knows.   Today has been the best day...all this year. I got a Mitsubishi and my dad got an Xterra.
