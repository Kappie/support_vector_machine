For those who believe in the patterns in day to day life, there has to be one here.  To all those who spend 23 hours in front of their computer (I only spend 19 hours and do not have the time) put your heads together and based on all the possible variables map out traffic for the next month.  Weathermen do it.  We are smarter and maybe not better looking but hell they are always wrong anyways.  I know no one reads this blog of mine, but if you consider my challenge.  I am offer a great prize if you can figure this out.  I big huge thank you in an email.  Keep me up to date.
