Anyone who knows me knows that this is one of my biggest pet peeves.  I continue to be surprised at the biggest load of bullshit some of my more intelligent friends/family will fall for, simply because it was passed on to them in an e-mail.  Yes, we are not infallible beings, and can be duped fairly easily from time to time, however I would figure the old addage "once bitten, twice shy" would kick in at some point.   These  are the folks who really piss me off.  The ones, after I've pointed out the errors in the e-mails, offered my services to research these claims  for  them, begged them to stop sending them, well, they keep sending them out.  Why does this frustrate me so?  I'm not entirely sure.  Could be I'm sad to see such (supposedly) intelligent people either aren't as intelligent as I had thought, or are painfully gullible.  Maybe I get pissed due to the sheer laziness I see all around me from day to day, and this is just a perfect example of this, causing me to wade in a nasty pool of cynacism (which I fight at every turn).  To the few people who have taken my words to heart, and have turned to me to validate some of these e-mails, or performed the research themselves,  thank you very much .  You all are the bright stars blinking on the outskirts of the black hole.  You know who you are.  For the remainder who appear to enjoy making fools of themselves because they refuse to expend one iota of energy to perform the minor amount of research necessary to validate/invalidate the e-mail claims, please stop sending me your crap.  I'd rather read my spam e-mails. ;)
