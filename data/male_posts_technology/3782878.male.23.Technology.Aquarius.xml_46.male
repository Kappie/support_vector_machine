Today I woke up at 10:50, 10 minutes before my shift. I dare you to try to get a 2yr old changed and dressed, a lady dressed and appropriately prepped for work, and drive 5 minutes to work, in 10 minutes. that gives all the things that need done 5 minutes to get accomplished. Frankly this worries me. I do not want to lose my job, it is not the finest job, but it's better than a lot of jobs I can think of. Tonight I'm going to take a nap when I get home I think, and then after that, I'm gonna go to bed early tonight, and I'm gonna tweak with the alarm such that I hope above all hopes that it does not fail me again. I also hope that my bosses realize that after 2 years of service to the company it is not my intention to come in late, nor is it my intention to put myself in a hazardous position to my career.  Also of note, Yesterday I began my attempts to Overclock my AMD 2400XP, Results have been okay so far. I've started making only small increments as this is my first try, and well I don't want to burn my processor to death. I stepped the Processor from 130mhz FSB which is what it was running at(about 1950mhz proc speed) to 135FSB(2045mhz Proc Speed) and adjusted the voltage by .25 volts. There was a noticable jump in temperature from what was a 58c temperature to a 61c base running temperature. Temperature at full activity now climbs but stays stable around 66c with no lock ups or crashing. I've been running Prime95 a Prime Number finder application that peaks processor at 100% usage, which means it should reflect what maximum system temp should be at full operation. I ran this test for 4 hours to prove whether or not it was reliable.  I've also come to the conclusion that the stock Fan for the AMD is crap, and a more premium cooler needs to be purchased for future overclocking, so I'll be researching this to determine what it is I'm gonna use. Stay tuned!  Try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix
