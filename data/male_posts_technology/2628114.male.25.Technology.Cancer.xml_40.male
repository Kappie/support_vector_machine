Even after watching the rain fall all day and watching the rain turn into a wintry rain-snow putrid mix, I still had a deep desire to run tonight.  I pushed yesterday's run back to today and did strongly debate not running, but for some reason, the snow falling with the rain was really intriguing to me.  After returning home a little later from work, I outfitted myself with my winter running gear (I thought winter ended a couple weeks ago?) and took off just before 9p.m.  There was nothing inviting about tonight.  The icy wind bit through my clothes, the rain continued to fall, and I was hungry  tired.  Either way I set out.  I did a loop up around Xavier for a 40 minute run.  I held a surprisingly fast pace and really felt great.  The cold soon went away as my body heated up and the rain was a somewhat welcome swamp cooler.  As I dodged puddles and squinted through my rain covered glasses, my body wore out much quicker due to being tired and hungry.  All was well though.  I was able to complete all 40 planned minutes and come back and eat.  Most every part of my body is glad for this cooldown period prior to the marathon.
