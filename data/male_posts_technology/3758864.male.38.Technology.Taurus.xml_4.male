Injuries first. None.  That’s always good to report. Suffice to say that none of the players that had been reported to be limping at some point yesterday appeared to be suffering any lingering effects from practice yesterday.  The defensive unit was out there stretching and doing some sprints. This gave the fans a good opportunity to watch Tony Brackens, Paul Spicer, and John Henderson do their sprints before heading back to the locker room. All three looked good. Stroud was out there briefly as well, and didn’t appear to be dealing with any pain issues that were obvious.  Bobby McCray was also out there getting in some sprints, and having a good time chatting it up with some fans. Naturally, the Gator gear was getting plenty of autograph time as he made his way down the fence line.  Rashean Mathis, Dewayne Washington, and Deon Grant spent the entire morning session working together on their timing while the team was going through it’s special teams drills.   Dewayne is a little guy compared to the other two. Watching the three of them working together, it was pretty clear that he was offering some instruction to the other guys on technique, which is a good thing considering his experience. Rashean looked terrific out there, showing good hands and great quickness in the drill they were working on.  Now, let’s get right to the drills.  Punt Returns / Coverage:   Chris Hanson was booming punts consistently and with mid-season accuracy. Again, he’s clearly back to his old form, and ready for the season to begin. Of special note is the fact that his wife and their baby were in attendance, and the boy is absolutely adorable.  David Allen, Jermaine Lewis, Allen Suber, and Matt Cherry did all of the punt return work in practice today, while Troy Edwards hung out with them but did not participate, although he was in his jersey and lugging his helmet around.   David Allen had the best day of the bunch, avoiding the dreaded muffs that bit the other guys, Lewis with the most regularity. Obviously, he’s got some rust to deal with.   Suber and Cherry also had a couple of muffs each on punts, including one to Lewis that doinked off of his face mask and was promptly recovered by Kiwaukee Thomas.   There was one special note regarding the long-snapping situation. 3 guys worked in rotation at the position during practice today.   Obviously, the ever-present Joey Z was in with the #1’s, while Mike Gomez worked with the #2’s. The #3 long snapper was none other than Double D, Donovin Darius. He actually did a decent job at the position with some pretty crisp snaps right on target. I know that he had done this in college, and has worked in this rotation in the past during camp. It’s good to see him willing to do some work with the special teams to help upgrade their situation.  Kiwaukee, Juran Bolden, Matt Hatchette, Blue Adams, Fred Stamps, Lewis Sanders, Chris Thompson, Ray Perryman, David Richardson, and Cortez Hankton all worked on drills to improve their technique on getting down field in kicking situations.   Greg Favors also participated in some of these drills as well.  Other than the little bit reported above, there wasn’t a whole lot to monitor at the practice. Anyone who’s been to a special teams practice knows that the vast majority of the time, they’re working on instructing the players, and nothing more.   No field goal work was done at all today. My guess is that they’ll be letting the kickers do their thing at the night practice, which I’ll be at.  More later!
