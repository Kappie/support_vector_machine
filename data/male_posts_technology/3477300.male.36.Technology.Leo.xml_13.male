Took Friday off from work, so I had three days of relaxation up there.  Debbie stayed home with the dog, so I was responsible for Ben!  First time we've been let out on our own for more than a couple of hours!  Had a great time cooking burgers and marshmallows on the log fire!  Didn't do much washing :)  Went on the beach some, climbed trees a little.  On our way home on Sunday we called in at  urlLink San Gregorio Store .      I always like to go there if I can find an excuse to be up on that part of the coast.  There's always a good live band playing on a weekend and the atmosphere always makes me feel like a cowboy.  Damn shame we had to return to "civilization".
