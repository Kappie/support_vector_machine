This is the coolest one I've seen in a long time, for Mojave Airport in California:   June 3, 2004   Advisory notice to all concerned â€“ Mojave Airport will be engaged in spaceport operations June 21st with potential extensions through June 22nd.  Aircraft will be PPR (prior permission required) for landing beginning June 18th 1600l.    Spaceport  operations.  Space Ship One made it to 100 kilometers altitude - the "official" edge of space - less than an hour ago as I write this.  Scaled Composites' website is getting hammered (as expected) at the moment, but here's the  urlLink NPR story .  Wow.
