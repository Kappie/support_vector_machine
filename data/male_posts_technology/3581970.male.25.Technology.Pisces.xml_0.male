For the love of all that is good, evil, holy, unholy, big, and small DO NOT BRING YOUR KIDS TO MOVIES!!!   Ok, not all movies. I understand that kids want to see movies too, which is the reason for movies rated G. I for the life of me can not figure out why parents bring their 1-4 year old children to the movie theaters. I went to see Spiderman 2 tonight(7pm showing) and the theater had a lot of children in it. Not kids aged 5-10...children! There were 4 or 5 children barely out of the womb. What kind of parent does that to a kid? Hell, why would a parent subject their child to other people when they know for a fact that they'll cause a disturbance?  In other news, Spiderman 2 is a kick-ass movie.
