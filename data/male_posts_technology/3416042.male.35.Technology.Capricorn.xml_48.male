Yes, I sing along in my car. To me, I'm not that bad - your  opinion may vary. So I like music by Live or Staind or David Lee Roth  better than I might otherwise because they sing in a key that's natural to  me. I have to wonder if that's why (or an additional reason why) women  like women singers more than men do, for  example.
