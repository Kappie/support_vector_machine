Vanquish your foes by always keeping yourself in a safe and unassailable position; then no one will suffer any losses.  The Way of a Warrior, the Art of Politics, is to stop trouble before it starts. It consists in defeating your adversaries spiritually by making them realize the folly of their actions.   The Way of a Warrior is to establish harmony.
