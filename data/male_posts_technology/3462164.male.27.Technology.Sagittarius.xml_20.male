Apparently, their spy Ahmed Chalabi, must have given them some indication that we Americans have no intention of opposing the Iranian armyâ€™s invasion of Iraq. If in fact the Iranian's do have a strong intelligence gathering presence in Iraq we might be better off attacking now rather than defending agianst an invasion with the enemy already behind our lines.
