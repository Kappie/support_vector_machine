Asda is extremely popular, as is Bingo for some reason. But the local Bingo crowd appear to be 20-somethings, and not the blue-rinse mob I would have expected.  My flight over was also funny. I was delayed and arrived in London City at 4PM. My connecting flight to Dundee was at 4PM. I pelted down to the check in desk, and the rather lovely brunette attendant said that the flight was over-booked and I may not be able to get on. As she rang in to check, I overheard the conversation between a stewardess next to us and an Arabic-looking gentleman. "I'm sorry sir" she said, "You cannot sit at the front of the plane as it would be nose-heavy and crash"..  OMFG.. What a thing to say, especially as I was shortly to be strapped into the aeronautical equivalent of a Morris Minor. Big up to Scot Airways. During the course of my one hour flight, I was offered two sweets, a caramel biscuit thing, a scone, a packet of those little pretzel things AND two cups of tea!  There's also some GREAT looking women up here. I think it's to do with the air. It's like breating Evian instead of swamp water. They are fresh faced and have a naughty sparkle in their eyes. You can bet my radar is well and truly tuned into 'Babe FM'. Anyway, I shall continue to report on my findings... Toaster out..
