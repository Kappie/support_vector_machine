While I was running I noticed how much work my body was doing just keeping my upper torso errect. By the end of my run (1hr 30min) my core was pretty pooped. I've also observed core fatigue during my swim program spcifically when I'm working on my kick. Not sure how/when to work in some  urlLink core development  but my guess is that it will help my performance.    urlLink    I think my  urlLink Tensor Fascia Latae  might be to blame. It burns like the dickens when I bike.  urlLink
