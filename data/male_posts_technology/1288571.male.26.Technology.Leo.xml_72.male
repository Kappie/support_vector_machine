These 3 movies have to be the best movies ever made.  If Peter Jackson doesn't get Best Director now, he'll be robbed plain and simple.  I have to say that I'm sad though now that its all over. I have no movies to look forward to. It'll be a long time coming until any movie is anywhere near as good as one of these.
