I do remember an interesting dream involving a global plague and having to steal a car at gunpoint.  I shan't mention  whose  car I was stealing... thats far too obscure.  I went out and bought  Black Hawk Down  and  Hulk  this afternoon.  I already owned Black Hawk Down on VHS, but its nice to have it on DVD as well.  Hulk is another matter.  As a testament to its reported poorness, the box self-destructed as I removed it from the plastic wrapping, much to my disgust.    Also got  The Forever War  by Joe Haldeman.  I've read that its a story in a similar vein to Heinlein's Starship Troopers.  I hope its even half as good.  I completed Command  Conquer Generals: Zero Hour today.  The game with the worst taste ever lives up to the C name in terms of presentation, but it is utterly without a soul.  You really don't care whether you win or lose.  At least the previous incarnations had one thing going for them - kick-ass FMV.  This new incarnation doesn't even have that... virtually everything is done using the engine.  Pah.  Roleplaying is looking as poor as ever.  As soon as a game comes along that looks half-decent, it is stopped for one reason or another.  I try to start games and finish them, even if I have to rush an ending.
