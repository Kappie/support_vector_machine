The recipient uses the -p option to unwrap the message and restore the sender s original filename.pgp -p filename.asc You can then store the files in a email message or database table in text format.  http://unixtips.org/index.php3?catList=8 ---  This is Incorrect.  This does not work with GPG version 1.2.1 For gpg command to act, it requires an option as well as a command. -a is an option and no command is being given.  Kindly remove this tip.
