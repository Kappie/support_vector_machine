After Abbott Laboratories raised the price of the 8-year-old Norvir to $8.57 a day from $1.71 late last year, patient groups and some members of Congress pushed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to take action, arguing it was warranted because Norvir's discovery was partially funded by taxpayer dollars. But the president has accepted more than  $21,000 from Abbott executives , and the Republican National Committee has raked in  more than $440,000  in soft money from the company, and thus the administration refused. A new  survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation  finds that Americans consider HIV/AIDS to be the second most pressing health problem facing the nation behind cancer, and among African-Americans it ranks first. Two thirds of young African-Americans say the US is losing ground in battling the epidemic.     WAR ON TERROR – SAUDIS LAVISH BUSHES WITH JEWELS:  According to Knight Ridder, the  Saudi royal family showered the Bush family  and top Bush officials with "$127,600 in jewelry and other presents" in 2003. Though there remain serious questions about the  Saudi government's financial ties to al Qaeda , the Bush family nonetheless accepted $95,500 worth of diamond-and-sapphire jewelry for first lady Laura Bush, two sets of diamond and white-gold jewelry and an $8,500 mantel clock "elaborately detailed in silver and gold vermeil." At the very same time U.S. law enforcement officials were expressing " deep frustration " with the Saudis' unwillingness to cooperate in the war on terror, White House Chief of Staff Andy Card and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice accepted two ornamental daggers; Secretary of State Colin Powell accepted an ornamental sword; and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld accepted a small golden statue. The Saudi royal family's gifts "dwarfed those of other world leaders, according to the tally, and easily eclipsed Abdullah's $55,020 in gifts in 2002."     IRAQ – CHILDREN DETAINED BY CPA:  An investigation by Scotland's Sunday Herald alleges that  coalition forces are holding more than 100 children in jails such as Abu Ghraib across Iraq . "Witnesses claim that the detainees – some as young as 10 – are also being subjected to rape and torture." The Herald's investigation is based in part on an internal UNICEF report written in June, which contains "a key section on child protection, headed 'Children in Conflict with the Law or with Coalition Forces,'" The report contains vague details about detention centers set up for children in Baghdad, but UNICEF was denied visits to the centers.  German journalists were the first to pursue that and other reports of child abuse in Iraq , including a claim made by an Iraqi TV reporter of atrocities committed in "Abu Ghraib's children's wing." The UNICEF report outlines the long-term damage such detentions could cause: "The perceived unjust detention of Iraqi males, including youths, for suspected activities against the occupying forces has become one of the leading causes for the mounting frustration among Iraqi youths and the potential for radicalization of this population group."
