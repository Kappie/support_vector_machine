I'm not sure what it is, but I just don't feel like things are working out between me and my girl.  This is despite the fact that we always have good conversations on the phone, we don't really fight, and I yearn to be with her every day.  I just feel like my situation with my job is going to strangle this relationship until the two of us have grown so far apart that there's nothing to salvage.  
 
  ***  Background for the common reader (don't snicker).  I live in NY.  My girl lives in VA.  I requested a move to VA to be with her, but that was denied.  Instead, they promoted me.  So I'm stuck, and I'm miserable without her.  *** 
 
 Upkeep of the relationship is hard.  We try to talk every day, but our busy lives keep one or the other from the phone during normal hours (before 11:00p).  Lately it's been small things that have made me think twice about whether or not we're meant to be.  For instance, I went to bed around 1:30a last night.  She called me at 2:30a, complaining about not being able to sleep.  I woke up at 8:30a, rolled into work around 9:15a and called my girlfriend.  Somehow, she still managed to get up at 6:00a and in to work by 8:00a.  How does she do that?  Is it bad that I need so much sleep and she so little?  Am I going to end up being an anchor for her when she wants to go dancing until late in the night and I'm too tired to go?
 
 To battle these feelings, I've been trying to lead a life of self-improvement.  I've been watching my diet, running, lifting weights.  I've been considering getting braces again, maybe whitening my teeth (my teeth run a close second to my feet and ankles for most beat-up body part -- another story).  I've been reading a lot, studying and thinking.  I've been improving my relationships with friends here in NY -- socializing more.  This war I've been waging has a two-pronged effect on my life.  First, it keeps me sane by making me feel better about myself.  Second, I feel it makes me more appealing to the woman in my life.  
 
 This is the maddening part.  I know she is the one for me.  I love her with all I have, all that I am.  But I have these doubts...these feelings that she doesn't really care about it any more.  She's resigned herself to  fatalism; "What will happen will happen," she said.  That's crap.  I know what I want.  I just need to find a way to get it.  I know that relationships are hard work, especially long distance relationships.  And I'm willing to work hard, to make this work.  It must work.  It's just that...
 
 I'm so far away.  The strain this distance puts on me is getting to be too much.  I don't know what to do.  My job won't let me move.  The only other option under my control is to quit, which would be suicide for my career considering my recent promotion.  I'd probably have to start over.  So, I've been backed into a corner so to speak.  I now have three options: 
 
 1.) Convince her that she needs to come live in NY for a year or so or
 2.) Get over it...learn to live with the mental strain or
 3.) End it.
 
 I'm going to scratch off number three because, well, that should be obvious.  So really I only have two options.  Option number one is tricky.  To convince her to move to NY is to convince her to take the biggest risk of her life: to leave all that definitely makes her happy (her family, her friends, her job, her home) and move in with the one she loves.  In my mind this is a no-brainer.  Not so in hers.
 
 Option number two is equally tricky, but for different reasons.  No matter what I try, I cannot rationalize this situation.  I cannot convince myself that one more year is tolerable.  I cannot fool myself into thinking that things will just "work out" in a year; that things will be different and somehow better.  It's true I'm young.  I'm impatient.  I want this now.  It must work.
 
 Always,
