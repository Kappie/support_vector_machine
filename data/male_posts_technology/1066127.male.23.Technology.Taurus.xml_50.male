Five minutes is only five minutes if you have just been given 5 more minutes to watch the game before helping around the house.   NOTHING This is the calm before the storm. This means "something," and you should be on your toes. Arguments that begin with 'Nothing' usually end in "Fine"   GO AHEAD This is a dare, not permission.. Don't do it.   LOUD SIGH This is not actually a word, but is a non-verbal statement often misunderstood by men. A "Loud Sigh" means she thinks you are an idiot and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you over "Nothing"   THAT'S OKAY This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can make to a man. "That's Okay" means that she wants to think long and hard before deciding how and when you will pay for your mistake.   THANKS A woman is thanking you. Do not question it or faint. Just say you're welcome.
