Just like I had mentioned as my views, in one of my earlier mails, every entity that is part of nature will undergo transformation and death. "Discussion" is just another entity in nature. And its bound by the same laws that bind every other entity. The "process" of discussing is another entity and its going to have its own tranformations and end. We notice this at the very basic levels of interactivity. Ans its in nature to transform whatever it binds.   Given this, its nothing surprising that our discussions take different forms at different times and sometimes come to an abrupt halt or take a different direction altogether.
