This is a prime example of why I don't buy into A) that there is global warming ocurring and B) if there is that we are having an impact on it  In 1491, scientists knew that the world was flat In 1902, scientists knew that powered flight would never work In 1911, the Titanic was unsinkable In 1947, man would never be able to travel faster than sound  I have been and remain a huge proponent of on-going scientific research, but let's use some common sense with what we do with what is learned.
