This blog will be about whatever I want it to be about, since (of course) this is my blog.  Please read this disclaimer, if you will.  ---- My blog will be moderately heavy on the cursing, talking bad about others, and bashing corperations like Apple. Please do not get offended by what I say, because even if you did, I wouldn't do a thing about it. I don't care. I will talk about what I want to, so if I want to talk about my girlfriend, I will. If I want to talk about the weather, I will. If I want to talk about my Dr. Pepper can, I will. Getcha? Good. ---- End Disclaimer.   First thing's first, I want you people to talk to me. Post comments about what I say, I want your input.  See any typing errors? GO AHEAD! Post em. I won't do anything about it, but that's ok...I still want to hear from you.   You guys like TechTV? I do, TTV inspired me to start talking about what I feel, so I will.  Well I've got to be heading out. I'll post when I feel like it, which may be once a month or 5 times a day. Whatever I feel like. Well hope you will comment on my opinions, I'd love to hear from you.
