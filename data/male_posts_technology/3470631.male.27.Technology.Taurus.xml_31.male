Throw a few hot chicks together, a guy with an australian accent, a few surfboards and Rebecca Donaldson Katsopalous and you've got yourself mjwern's pick of the summer -- at least until North Shore starts on Fox.   Alright we're 5 minutes into the show and there is a black person on the cast. Teen Soap no-no. I'm immediately turning the channel. This show has no chance at surviving. Sorry.   The DVD handi-cam from Sony ad was just on tv - looks fantastic. Thanks Cusick.   Tough times the other night in Texas - after all that happened on Sunday, I didn't get to my hotel room until 2am that night due to Tstorms in the area. Bad times.   Met with the DEA today - nothing like lining your hallways with pictures of dead Mexican drug dealers. Hilarious.   Back in town Wednesday night - back to reality?
