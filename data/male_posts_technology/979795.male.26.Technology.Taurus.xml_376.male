Think the rest of the guys in Siglap will be popping by Expo on Sat. I guess if they are doing so, I should do the same. Emailed Frankie Sensei to inform him that I may not be going ARCC this Sat and I might pop by the Expo exhibition to help out Freddy Sensei  AFS instead. But that also means I'll be missing my weapons class this Sat. Drat!  Had a stroke of promising review from Richard lastnight, he said I had an "advantage" because I kept training with beginners both in Siglap and BV, and that he sees me improving. That's one thing about some of the slightly senior belts, they sometimes tend to siam white belters. I'd personally prefer to take a white belter first, and then rotate partners later on in the class if only I can be sure the white belter I'm leaving behind is able to get a decent partner. Hmm ... not trying to inflate my ego but I also pondered, what area did I improve on? I did feel that last night's training was smooth, I didn't get myself lock down by a stiff uke or anything. I dunnoz also. My uke is only into his first month of training and I also think he has improved. He's beginning to know how to follow nage's movement in a certain way. When we did Shihonage, he was even able to tell me that he was falling down when I wasn't even applying the lock and pulling him to the ground. I was surprised because he took the words from right out of my mouth. I really wanted to tell him not to anticipate what I was about to do. I'm sure he doesn't quite realise it, but he does a pretty decent job at maintaining his hands in front of him when he did shihonage as well as the initial hand movement of diverting uke's ki relatively naturally. I had to follow follow follow and I found myself rising up and down because of his height.Not on purpose but because he was actually controlling me.  But things change when I pair with a more senior belt. Maybe that means I can't blend properly as an uke? Maybe it means my ukemi still got some major problem I need to concentrate on. Food for thought, which aspect of Aikido did I improve on so far and which area is still lagging far behind? Hmmmmm...  Anyway, I know students from Pillars will be down on Sat as well, probably gonna see a lot of slamming again hehe...  Tonight went on to watch Passion of Christ with my aunts, uncles and family. Originally thought it was a family / relatives event. But when I got there, the freaking number of crowd entering the cinema made me realise it was a church which booked the whole cinema. Look, I have nothing against Christians / Christianity but I honestly can't stand events like these. Most of my freinds are aware I dislike crowds as well so I really felt doubly irritated. To be fair, the show was really well made. I didn't realise it wasn't an English film until when the show started. Very interesting. Movie was enjoyable just not the atmosphere. Sure, I realised it was Good Friday lah. I guess I should've expected something like that. But it only strengthened my conviction that I really don't wanna hang around a Christian crowd. Note that I said 'crowd', not people. Christian people, I have no problem with. Just not like such a huge crowd kinda size. Worse still, at the end of the show they actually turned off the credits and started to sing 1-2 Christian songs. Dammit! I'm the type who would rather take a look at the credits at the end of the show. People who work in the background are often taken for granted. Sometimes the least we can do is finish watching the credits - especially if the movie was a great one. Was basically showing my black face throughout and I hardly spoke to anyone of my relatives and family from the moment I entered Cineleisure (not the cinema yet), till the journey to Suntec for dinner. Think they could tell also that's why they basically left me alone as well. I'm feeling guilty about that but sorry lah, I show my mood quite frankly around relatives. Not that I'm bratty, just that I feel that sometimes no need to put on a mask among people you feel close to. Going to Suntec, I complained to Daphne via SMS about the whole thing hahaha ... Ms PA indeed, always there to hear me complain about stuff.  Luckily I had a great dinner at Swiss culture. (My sis's treat to my family coz she just got her promotion/pay increment.) My mood was basically turned around because of the dinner. Good lah, I wanna look back and remember the show for what it's really good at, not the environment of the cinema. That's giving the film due credit where it really deserves.
