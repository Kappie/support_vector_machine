There are a few ppl at  urlLink kf  that I've promised, but not 6.  Anyways, at work I'm almost done with all the interfacing for the blue project.  I'll upload a working version later today, at work.  Yesterday I got some good shots of the garden; will upload later as well.  I had a good weekend overall.  We went to the town I used to live in, and my step-dad went to an old tavern.  hehehe.  peace out.  btw,  urlLink mike  has made a shoutbox and put it live on his site.. Very impressive; i'm envious.  I checked out two books tho...
