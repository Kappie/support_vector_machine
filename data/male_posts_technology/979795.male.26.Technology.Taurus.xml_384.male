Yesterday's classes were very bored with all the theory stuff I had to say. But today's classes were slightly better. Noticed a trend, the first class I take will kinda be the 'worst'. Probably I'm still experimenting on how to handle people and teaching contents across to the class.  Good weather in the morning because it rained. But that stopped pretty quick as well. Hope that cool weather will prevail from today onwards. Well, at the very least, I hope it doesn't get warmer than it already is.  Went Aikido at BVCC. Was quite good training. Freaking knackered though. Was totally wet by the end of the first hour. My uke had a problem keeping his momentum coming and I'm not so good at controlling him. Even the first thing we did (backstretch) didn't feel that good. He'd just grab, then go all heavy like a boulder. After my tenkan, he'd just hang on damn tight to my wrist but did not push. When he push, he keeps pushing me forward instead of up. Didn't feel like doing anything funny today, so I kinda left him as he is. Anyway, he wasn't stiff, just that he's not feeling enough as uke. Of course, as nage I probably didn't lead him in enough in most of the things we did. Oh well, takes 2 hands to clap.  Later on we did group work and there were a few throws. On one of them, after I was thrown. Something 'came out' of my nose. The feeling I had was like 'wah shiok, my nose feels so clear', as though I had just blown my nose like that. I wiped my nose with my hands and I saw red. As in blood. Fish. Was having a nose bleed. At the same time Sensei called for a stop and he demoed another technique. I quickly set down behind and started holding my head up. Didn't even notice what technique he was teaching. Wiped my nose a few times and the blood just kept coming. Think it was bleeding on and off for at least half a min. Not sure how long it was but it felt like ages before Sensei let us practice amongst ourselves. I asked permission to go to the toilet amid all the surprised look. Maybe some folks would be thinking, "Was it Sunny who gave Aylwin the bloodied nose?" "Or Eileen" muahahaha... Well, I cleared myself up quick and spent the next 30 mins or so watching instead. Didn't wanna risk more blood dripping over my gi. My hands got most of the blood, but I did touch my pants by accident and left a bit of stain there. Anyway, I hope the stains come off. Got them washed the moment I got back.  Got a Super Big Gulp for 2 bucks from 7-eleven after training. Woohoo ... shiok man. I felt too bloated after that. Should've stuck to the normal $1.70 Big Gulp instead. While waiting for the bus, the whole area suddenly blacked out. Not kidding, the only lights came from the headlights of cars on the roads. You could see the even streetlamps were out. The darkness stretched from Clementi area down to Holland Village, Commonwealth, Queensway, Holland Road (to town), etc and those are only the area I passed by on the bus. I believe it was quite a major black out and a huge part of S'pore was affected. Was kinda worried that my home would be affected too but luckily, the area from Orchard Road onwards seemed fine... whew.  A really weird day.
