Saturday was a busy day...up at 9, quick shower, and had to be in Dover, De. for my kids football game at 10.....Jon, my middle son, brought his g/f so of course she spent the entire day w/ us...well, Rita took Kimmie (sons g/f) home at 11pm and was back at the house about 11:20...I was on the front porch having a cigarette...she basically stepped around me and said "well, i'm going to bed"...I asked if she could spare time to talk and she hesitantly said yes...I don't remember the exact wording, but I basically told her that the longer that we are together, the less interest we seemed to have in each other...she agreed w/ me on that one (and immediately broke into tears)...She tried to make alot of excuses, alot of them having to do w/ the kids or being tired when she gets home from work, in which I replied that it was "Us" which was growing apart and had nothing to do w/ the kids...as a matter of fact, the kids are the reason that I was still there..I said that i was tired of it and could not take it anymore... at this point, she walked in the house ...before i could finish my cigarette she came back onto the porch..She agreed w/ everything that I had said, but asked that we give it one more try..maybe even try some "marraige counselling" (which I'm not that thrilled of)...we never set any kind of "date" or "trial period", but she promised that she would "try" to change...I explained to her that was all well and good, but i didn't want to "pretend" to be happy Well, this morning Rita let me sleep in and made breakfast...she actually cleaned house today too... Sunday night is usually "family night" in which we all sit around and play a game or rent a movie (or something to that effect)..Rita usually goes back in the bedroom and does her own thing, but tonight she actually stayed out in the living room and watched a movie w/ the rest of us... and beat this shit, she even asked if i wanted to lay on her lap and she would rub my head...(Ususally it takes a migrain headache and hours of begging for that!) But I am not going to Lie..I still have feelings for Sue, and when I think about her (which I do often) and when I think about her, I get really depressed, because I think I have lost her for ever..I'm even afraid to "IM" her cause I just can't stand her rejection or her hating me...I really care what she thinks...I would do anything for her... GOD! HOW DO I GET MYSELF IN SHIT LIKE THIS!
