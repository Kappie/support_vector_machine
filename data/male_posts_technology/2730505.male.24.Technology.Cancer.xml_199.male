Friday was just a freakin' geek fest.  Played Rainbow till fucking dawn.  It was a good ole time.  Bought a 12 pack, stayed home and nerded it up.  What's that?...I'm a geek?  Well hell yeah I am and I'm damn proud of it.  Saturday was a planned day at the Taste but that didn't really happen considering it was fucking raining for most of the day.  It sucked.  By the time I was able to go out we just went to Ribfest in Naperville.  That was a good time too except we got there a little too late.  Ribs were good except for one where it smelled so damn good but in the end, the ribs weren't that juicy.  It was also damn expensive!!!  Fucking $4 for 2 ribs!!!  $4 dollars?!?!?  I got robbed!  Anyways, there was one booth where they said it had the hottest barbeque sauce around so I took a fork and dripped some sauce to try it and DAMN! it was hot!  I mean it wasn't hot at first but about 5-7 seconds later it started to get hot and then hotter and it was just freakin hot.  I'm not a puss either, I can eat hot stuff like it was nothing but this was hot.  It had the flavor and everything.  Smokey, think bodied and sweet all at the same time and then in the tail end it was just like a brush fire that turned into a freakin forest fire.  Soo good!  so after bumming around ribfest for an hour it closed down.  We then went to Bar Louie for a beer or two.  Had a beer there and left.  I was a little tired from all the freaking walking.  That just sucked and I think that it took a lot out of the people I went with.  I just went home (it was about 12:30 by then) and hopped online for a couple.  Sunday I woke up late.  I didn't realize that I was that tired but I guess I was.  Made some lunch, watched the Cubs sweep the Sox in the cross town classic.  Hell yeah, Sox walked in the winning run.  Fuck yeah baby!  Bragging rights till next summer.  Derek called and he and Carmie invited me to go watch some fireworks in St. Charles.  So I did.  I had to get out of the house again.  It was sorta raining early but it didn't so it was good.  After that we went to St. Charlie's for some $2.50 Coronas.  Had a few there checking out the St. Charles hotties.  DAMN!  I don't know what is up either but the fucking girls of St. Charles were looking so fine Derek was having problems not checking them out in front of his GF.  I also don't know what the ell it is about pink this season but every damn girl is wearing pink.  most of them wear that white belt too.  Now I don't know if that's just because of the two girls that I was dancing with last week or what not but shit, the white belt with the low rise jeans and a pink top is just HOTT!  Carmie got wasted.  I guess not eating and having two bloody mary's in a hour will do that to you.  Derek talked about offering a room in their house for rent.  That's cool, I might just take them up on it sometime next year if I need to move out.  After that what else?  Some Rainbow was in order.  Played that for a few, took a break to eat and hopped online again.  I was playing with a bunch of fucking kids late at night though.  That was some BS.  Whatver, I was mopping the floor with them.  It was all good.  Monday woke up around 12.  Saw Matt Clement pitch an incredible game but he gave up that one homer and lost.  That was fucking BS.  He's becoming the Kerry Wood of last year where he is not getting the run support.  I mean, the other team isn't even scoring that many runs.  His record is 7-7 but if the Cubs scored at least 4-5 runs in 5 of the games that he lost his record would have been 12-4.  Oh well, I guess that's how it goes.  He's still a good pitcher and I'm glad Hendry didn't trade him.  Ben sheets also pitched a great game (for Milwaukee) gotta give that guy some credit.  While doing that I was doing my laundry at my parents house.  I gotta pick the rest of that stuff up today so that I have some clothes tomorrow.  So I am finally 350 kills over deaths.  I just can't seem to get to 1000 over fast enough!  I mean I kill 3,4,5 people and in looking for the last few guys I always end up getting shot.  I got my damn rush down to a science but I just gotta play smarter.  Take last night for example.  Map was warehouse 6v6.  I rushed the catwalk and shot three guys right off the bat.  One was in the lower small box room behind one of the boxes, and two were still throwing grenades into the big box room.  I got throw two with two shots.  After wards, I was informed by someone on my team that there were two headed to own spawn from the stairs behind red team's spawn.  I started to head towards their spawn and they just peeked by the door, shot two of them down.  5 kills in under a minute.  The only person left was Boyd ( urlLink EAT ME SUCKA ).  (if you clicked on the link, he is pretty good so that is why I was getting scared)  He took out two before he took me out.  I was about to turn the corner to go down the stairs but as soon as I turned, I saw gun fine and next thing I knew I was dead.  I really need to start playing smart every round.  I just can't keep dying like this.  I don't know if I will reach 1000 kills over deaths before Black Arrow comes out but I will surely give it my best.  This Friday I hope to be going to Iowa to pick up Bryce for the weekend.  this weekend is the company picnic.  It's going to be held at Cougar Staduim (of the  urlLink Kane County Cougars ).  that should be a good time.  Free food, sun and baseball.  I hope that  urlLink Bryce  will be there.  He can hang out with my family for once in a long time.  I guess that is what I have for now and what I am looking forward to for the weekend.  Even though it's a lot of driving, it's well worth it.  Hope everyone had a good 4th and have a great week as well.  Remember if you are in the General Chicago West burbs area or will be the weekend of the 17th.  I have a free party at North Beach.  Say GONZO at the door and it's free to get in from 9-11 and free drinks from 10-11.  Should be a good time.
