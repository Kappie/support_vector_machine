I went today to pick up some gear for paintball, I needed some equipment to fix my gun and thought that the best place for it was in Manchester, as it's just down the road.  HA!  Mite as well ordered the damn stuff online, but i wanted to question someone about the gear I was purchasing.  So we set off, and spent two hours being bounced around the bloody city becasue a major roadworks was in place and had diverted the traffic almost 10 miles in both directions.  And here's another little kicker...  Manchester has very few main roads!  Yup, you read that right, it's mad up of THOUSANDS of little streets and alleyways.  And were does all the traffic have to go?  Down all these little streets because someone in the council decided that mid summer, after the biggest storm in the last 5 years has hit, is the best time to dig up all 7 main arteries to the city for maintenance and widening.  Bloody inspired!  How about building more roads through the goddamn eyesore first!  They could start by moving residents out of 3 main areas through the inner city, as 90% of the areas are vacant, and free up the damn space for roads and new industry lots.  I mean come on, i passed 3 industrial estates that were vacant and falling to bits, yet the council wont level them as its (and i quote) "Merely a shift in the ecomomic balance of the country.  Soon the balance will teeter back and industry will pour back into the city." well thats all fine and good, but those industrial estates have been abandoned since before I was born!  Somehow, I don't think they'll be filled any time soon.  Worse still, we finally get there, and the buggers have moved about 10 miles closer to the city centre.  Seems that no-one could get to them, so they moved last saturday, and hadn't bothered mentioning this when I phoned them on the Friday.  Anyone think someone was taking the piss a bit?  Anyway, have found another place to get the equipment, so i'm sodding manchester off as a source, and hope never to set foot in that cesspit again.  At least till the next time.  But today has been an eye-opener, if nothing else.  City planners have alot to answer for here in the north, especially when it comes to real-estate.  So while the city smothers itself in it's own car fumes, it's residents can sleep easy knowing that 50 year old, none existant industry has a home withing it's city limits.
