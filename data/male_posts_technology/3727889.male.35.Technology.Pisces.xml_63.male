I need to stop doing that and just call it a night.  The Poker Gods must have missed me because I have played all of 3 minutes this morning and am up $10 at this point playing .50/1. Not bad. Wish I could make that BB per hour all the time!  One of my readers had a decent idea (Piper_bt). He says and I quote "It would be nice to know some of the Bloggers names on different sites". If anyone wants to send there site names I will either create a new section here to keep track or post them next to your Blog name or something. It is kind of fun to get someone saying "Hey, are you SirFWALGMan from the Blog?"  Tonight is my official Poker night. I have agreed with the Wife to limit myself to Monday and Thursdays and sometimes on the weekend. I am going to play a little NL at 9ish, and then enter the Sunday Night NL Poker Qualifier for one dollar. If I win that I get to try the 25K Sunday Night NL game. It starts a 9:00 on Empire. Anyone who wants to harass me come on down.
