People really deserve to know the full truth about wars in general: bombs kill everyone indiscriminatively, people come back missing limbs and other gruesome stuff.  That's the stuff the army recruiter will never tell you about.  One of the issues with this movie is that the message is so one sided that it definitely sickens anyone with half a brain.  Can you claim sophisticated audience with a sane perspective w/o loosing the "simple folks"?  This calls for a multi layered masterpiece and that seems to be beyond Michael Moore's capabilities.  A good review can be found on IMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361596/.  -mb  PS: everyone should see this movie :)
