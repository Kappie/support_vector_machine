First let me say that I was a massive fan of both The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, so I am very confused that I didn't enjoy VH.  It didn't make me laugh, and I found the story far too convoluted for the type of film that it is.  This could be the dissappointment of this not being the film that I wanted it to be. I was really looking forward to the merging of the three main Universal monsters, something that would take itself just seriously enough but also be fun in the old style.  Ah well....
