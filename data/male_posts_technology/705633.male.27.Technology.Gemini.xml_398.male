And, no. I havent met a new swamptroll.  I haven’t posted in a while as I haven’t had sufficient interesting information to relate to the world. Like using an elastic band pre-coitaly, When I do, it will be with sufficient gusto that it will leave me short of breath.  Anyway, Once I can get Photoshop working, I will have something that would have made even the great J.C. cry “Lordy, No! I’m no son of God? All I wanted to do is look at Gristy’s post!”  But that is… If I can get it working…  On a separate note, Adam? Is that our very own Psycho in the picture below? to the left of Mr Weasel? Just next to the hands about to clap?  He is such a party animal.
