Last night i had this weird dream... My friend Souhel and his wife Fayze, they got married a week or two ago, but since my aunt passed away a week before their weeding i was not able to be present there. I think i should call and congratulate them. Another dream was about Zohar from Eilat.. She was my neighbor the time when i was there... The weird thing about this one is that she was disgustingly fat! It has been a month or two since the last time we had a conversation.  When i woke up i had to search for a quote the matches with my dream and i've found the one above. I've found many  urlLink interesting quotes here.
