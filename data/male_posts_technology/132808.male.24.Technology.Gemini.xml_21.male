Remember when we used to play hockey, and even though that team had Teemu, Tkachuk, Zhamnov, Domi and Housley, I would VOLUNTARILY call Evgeny Davydov?  Crazy stuff.  Almost as crazy as that basketball card game we invented.  "And in the first round, the Terrors select, from the New York Knicks, guard John Starks"  On another note, the Bombers play the Args on Sunday... who's down for some tix?  Oh, and TJ's on Saturday, Pal's on Monday.  Woman is a danger peace.
