(This makes one for Firefox, and like 20 for Internet Explorer, so I'm not switching back any time soon...).  Unlike Internet Explorer, a fix for this problem is already out.  Read about the same-day-fix  urlLink here .  Either you can download the new version,  urlLink 0.9.2   or install  urlLink this extension  (just click and it should auto-install).  It is important to keep in mind that Firefox is still a Technology Preview, and not considered a finished product by the Mozilla people.  For this reason it is important to update it occasionally.  (For the most part, it seems pretty damn polished to me though!).  In much cooler news, Mandrake Linux is making a big  urlLink SPLASH  in France where they are helping to replace a whole lot of Windows NT systems with Linux ones!
