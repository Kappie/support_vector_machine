THERE'S WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE... BUT IT'S ALMOST TOMORROW AND I WAS GOING TO COME IN EARLY ANYWAY.  sorry... caps lock was on *sheepish grin*  anyway... what's a gay man to do? i've got loyalty to my job... but i also have loyalty to my throat and stomach... oh... why me!?!?!?!?!   ooh! i wonder if they'd deliver a couple miller litesand a burger to 400 robert street north...  hmmm.....
