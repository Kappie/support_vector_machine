After driving up to visit the family in Chicago, I sort of ran a 50 yesterday.  Between the 15-20 mph winds (with gusts of 40), my physically exhausted body, the mentally challenging course, and drop in temperature my run yesterday just stunk.  I was already tired from a lack of sleep in the previous two nights.  The wind was ridiculous.  There really were times when I would be stopped in my tracks because of the wind.  The course was some insane, flat, straight path that was mentally impossible to conquer.  There is not much good I can say about yesterday's run except the fact that I get to see my sister, brother-in-law, and beautiful niece before and the run (who I usually don't get to see).
