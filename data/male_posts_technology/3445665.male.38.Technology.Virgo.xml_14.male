After the meeting I worked for a couple of hours on making the headless linux port link and load on os x.  Then I headed over, got license tabs for my Van, and decided to finally fix the 12 volt battery in my Prius.  It had gone dead last year and nothing at the auto store fit, so I put one that was too big in it and hooked it up with jumper cables.  Toyota wanted $320 for a new battery.  Yeah, I thought that too.  So I went to the store and got more stuff for my party.  While I was there I picked up some battery terminals and a few little supplies to try to rig up a perminant solution for the battery in the trunk.  That is on hold for a while.  Looked for a van battery at the store, but they didn't have one the right size.  Took all my winnings and went home.    Worked until like 4am that night, finally got a widget to load in headless mac.
