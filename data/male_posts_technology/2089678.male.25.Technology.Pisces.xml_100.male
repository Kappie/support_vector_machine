Heres just a short list of the events   Got Married   On the 15th day of September I  tied my knot  registered myself having wed to the best girl in the universe(I found). Unlike the traditional way, I married the girl I loved. Its my belief that a person should marry  only  for LOVE.     Dream come True   urlLink Xyling Technologies . It is a dream that has realized after 3 years of continuous efforts. Now I could say myself and the world, NEVER LOSE HEART, dreams come true.. they really do.... The company is not meant to make money, it is meant to make life simpler. It has been conceived to assist people by blending the need and technology.    My Child Praised by the World   urlLink JACK - Java All Class reference Kit  is my BrainCHILD. I rember the day when I started learning Java and did not even know that Java has a rich set of API and that I can get a reference from the web or download something which we know it as documentation. That day JACK was conceived and on the first of the year 2004, it was delivered.  JACK had been well accepted by the developers across the globe and the number of visitors have grown to 600 a day since the time it has been launched. JACK had been listed on many popular Java based international portals and the press release of JACK could also be found on 20th January, Sun Microsystem's java.net website.  I always keep JACK handy, the shortcut I use to start JACK on my Windows machine is Ctrl+Alt+J.  JACK is a pure Java code and thats the reason it flies on any machine having JDK 1.2 or higher. Recently I tested it on Sun JDS without modifying even a bit of it and it did really well. Its good and its bad. Good because it is much faster and easier to use compared to the traditional HTML Docs, Bad because its addictive. You can use it to browse any java based API generally packaged into JAR and ZIP files.   Blogs...  Sometime back in October last year, I discovered this term blog. I tried learning more about blogging and now is the day, I run one of the most popular blogs on Java technology. Its been a month since I had made my blogs public and there are more than 350 RSS subscribers today.   My Wish for this year  Hey, I am getting late for the party... catch ya on my next birthday when I am gonna turn 27 :-D
