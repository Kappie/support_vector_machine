Today I spent alot of time sweating and looking for something to do.  The crew I work with is pretty cool, but they seemed a tad unprepared for me.    I got in this morning at 9 and was the first one there.  I couldn't do much, cuz I didn't have access to the computers or know where anything was.  Once some people showed up they gave me some files to read, but still no computer access.  I got a phone and a data device to noodle on, but those are things I know inside and out.  I asked the IT guy to get me set up on the network so I could do a bit of web study on the Roger's plans and pricing and what have you.  He got that done by about 2:30... Of course I don't have any customers yet, but that will come.  I did call Sheldon today (the band's bass player) as he owns a towing company and I may be able to save him a few bucks in wireless charges.  He will fax me his bills tomorrow and I can see what I can find for him based on his usage and needs.  And other than that...more study is all I have to do tomorrow.  All in all it looks like I'll enjoy the environment, as everyone seems pretty groovy and the atmosphere is pretty laid back.  Now the only thing is to see if I can make any dough doing it.  I did apply again at Bell: they're posting once again for a retail account manager...obviously the guy they hired over me last time didn't work out. Or maybe it's expansion...who knows.  I have set my alarm for 6 AM tomorrow...gonna hit the gym in the morning before work if I can get out of bed.  Sound body =  sound mind... I gotta keep this fact in the front of my thought pattern when I sleep tonite.
