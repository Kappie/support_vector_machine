Frankie Sensei later mentioned that the kata were from a form of karate kata which actually uses up to 2 tantos (1 was held with the tip poiting out - as like our bokken, and another held the opposite way with the tip pointing towards our elbow). First time I seen, or heard of tanto kata. But I don't think it's a practice in Aikikai style though. Anyway the dagger pointed outwards is used to slash at uke, while the other is held up to protect ourselves (the logic sounds exactly like our usual Aikido practice as in yoko or shomenuchi).  Anyway, Jeremey would stand there while Michael used the tanto to slash at certain parts of his uke, then they'd switch roles. But Michael tend to do more reps when it was his turn. Which led to Jeremy commenting, "Eh, you damn shiok right.", while nage was slashing away at him. Hahaha... Anyway, I didn't manage to remember every step (slash) for the kata. I can probably only remember 1-6, then 8 and 9. Somewhere in between I got lost already.  Yesterday was Seng Guan's and Nicholas's 5th kyu grading. They passed. I thought that they did very well. Frankie Sensei commented the same. Much better than some of the days they trained. Really, they just seemed more at ease and relaxed.
