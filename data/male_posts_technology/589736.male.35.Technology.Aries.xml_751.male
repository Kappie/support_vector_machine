How am I different? How am I different?   I can't do it so move along do you really want to wait until I prove you wrong? And don't tell me-- let me guess I could change it all around if I would just say yes   But how am I different? How am I different? How am I different?   And just one question before I pack-- when you fuck it up later, do I get my money back?   I can't do it and as for you-- can you in good conscience even ask me to Cause what do you care  about the great divide as long as you come down on the winner's side   And how am I different? How am I different? How am I different?   Just one question before I pack-- when you fuck it up later, do I get my money back?
