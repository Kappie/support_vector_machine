Fortunately, I was able to sap enough restfulness out of that hour and a half to be affective today :) Running is good. It makes me feel awake and healthy. Anyway, it seems like I may get off this weekend so I'll have time to run errands!!! YAY!!!  I've also been remembering this movie I saw like 2 years ago with Jarred. It's called "Intacto" and is a spanish film about luck. It was really great and if you love foreign films I highly recommend this one.  Anyway, I've got some Localization peeps to manage. Peace- T
