For some unknown reason, chicks find it hilarious, which isn't really too nice cos I was expecting it to invoke awe and (sexual) curiousity in them.  I got a couple of  nicks in mind already that would probably be taken more seriously ; Gargantua, Big Bert, BeastInTheSack, LoveMachine ..that's about it. Any more suggestions will be more than welcome.
