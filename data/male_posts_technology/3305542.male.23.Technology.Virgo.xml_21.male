If you donate $25 or more to MoveOn.org, you get the cd before it is released to record stores. Some of the bands included that I am interested in are:       They Might Be Giants     REM     David Byrne    There are plenty of other bands too, so check it out.    I will also take this time to let you know that TMBG are offering recordings of all their live shows from the current tour for download through their online music store at  urlLink http://www.theymightbegiants.com   They are charging $10 for the full concert in an almost unedited format.  I'm thinking I'll have to get the First Avenue show, since I didn't get to go.  Later, - Jeff
