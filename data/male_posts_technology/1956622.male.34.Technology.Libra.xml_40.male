I talked to Karissa for a minute and she told me she caught a catfish today but she let it go and it was not dead.  Then Jimmy changed the channel on the TV which sent Karissa into an outrage so my conversation with her was no more.  I then had the pleasure of talking to   SFW   regarding Karissa coming down.  She still insists that I pay her child support even with Karissa here "because she has financial obligations"  To which I keep replying that Child support is for the child not for Mommy's expenses.  She asked me to give her another 24 hours to "think about it".  Personally I think she is just buying time trying to figure out how to be a bitch and not look bad!
