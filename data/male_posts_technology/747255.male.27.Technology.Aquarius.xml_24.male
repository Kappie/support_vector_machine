Fifth grade graduation seems over done.  Anyway, I've learned a very important lesson today. Soft Scrub is foamy. It may not seem foamy when used properly but when you put it in the dishwasher it foams up pretty good. There are a couple of rust stains on the inside of the dishwasher left behind by a cookie sheet and I was cleaning them up with soft scrub with bleach. When I finished I started the dishwasher up with a full load. Looked just like it does in the movies... Water and foam slowly creeping across the kitchen floor. Dripping into the basement below...  I'm stupid. Luckily I was able to suck all the foam out of the dishwasher with my shop vac.
