All my busses were on time.  I was able to deposit my paycheck at the bank. It was lovely outside.  I got to hear Lonnie Smith talk about his early 80s cocaine addiction on the radio and then learned that Justin Leone talks like Rocky Balboa, a fact which amuses me to no end.  I had a perfect of coffee.  And now that I'm at work I get fairly fun stuff and then leave early at 3PM.   July 23rd 2004, will you marry me?
