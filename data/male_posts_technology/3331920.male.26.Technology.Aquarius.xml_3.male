I had a pounding headache after coming home from work, and hit the bed around 6:30, the next thing i knew it was 10, and Angel was coming to bed.  So what the hell, i'm already in bed right?  So i slept right through till this morning when i got up for work.  It felt weird, sleeping for almost 12 hours straight.  I even still had the headache around 5 this morning and had to get up for some Tylenol.    I found an interesting opportunity on the web today, a company called Massive Black.  They are looking to hire contract employees for 3D modelling, texture design, etc.  Ideally, i will start my 'freelance plan' soon, with the ultimate goal being landing a contract with a company like Massive Black.   Without giving up my day job, i would like to expand my skills enough to be able to take on interesting and mind-expanding contracts to get some of that all important 'job-satisfaction'.  But more on this at a later date.  I have some serious planning and content-creation to do first.  I'm out.
