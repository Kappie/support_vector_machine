I have my Anthro Summative, with a drop dead due date of Tuesday [I'm certain I can get it done by then], My physics summative is due at some point next week, the programming compition is... tomorrow, along with my party.  Fun stuff.  I feel bad in antrho, because I didn't do my homework for chapters 3,4,5,6, or 7... so I need to get those done. I figure I'll work on them after the summative is over with.  I'm in computer Engineering now... I drove to school today, in the Optra, so I have my incubus mix CD, I brought it in, and its playing over the speakers in the computer engineering room right now :).  "Whatever Tomorrow Brings, i'll be there",  --Drive, by Incubus  Just heard that. I guess it applies right now, I can get all this stuff done, I can win that compition, I can get through the rest of this school year.  Out of everything going on tomorrow, I'm really just looking forward to seeing Sarah the most. I love being around her, being with her, randomly talking about absolutly nothing, or having a conversation about somthing serious, its awesome.  "Its all been said, with the exeption for the right part... when will we be new skin?", --New Skin, by Incubus  What else is going on... Oh, Wilfrid Laurier University offers a 5 year program in which you get both a Bachelors in Computer Science AND a Bachelors in Buisness, which would be _exactly_ what i'm lookinf for.  I'm still going with the idea that I want to take over the dealership, and in order to do so, I would have to get my degree (4 or 5 years), then spend 5 to 7 years working at the dealership before I could apply to become an official Licensed GM dealer.  Anyway, --Grant.
