I wish there was another reason I was loopy, but it just seems to be sleep related :)  I find it interesting that it's about 70 degrees outside and can remain 80+ degrees in my room.  I want to save money, but I get this overwhelming sense that I should spend it too. No shopping therapy for this boy. I am going to save it for my rainy days ahead.  I want to run tomorrow, but my running buddy is away, and I need to sleep after today's long hours.  Meeting new peeps is fun. Being a dick at work is not.  Exhaustedly yours- Tim
