These numbers only represent training zones for running. I've not tested my Max Heart Rate (MHR) for the other disciplines. To get my MHR I ran a warmup followed by a short sprint, followed by a recovery jog and yet another sprint. I should have paid more attention to the time spent sprinting and recovering as I'm not sure I pushed myself long enough. I also think I might have ran too fast; my lungs might have given out before my heart reached its max. I plan to do this test a couple more times in order to get more accurate numbers.      Target heart-rate  =  % intensity  *  heart-rate reserve  +  resting heart-rate     Resting HR : 50  Running Max : 180  HR reserve : 130      02  LVT-a  LVT-b  LVT-c  VO2  LAC     70%  75%  80%  92%  95%  98%     141  148  154  170  174  178      LVT-b(80%) is considered " urlLink Lactate Threshold " beyond which lie  urlLink much wailing and gnashing of teeth . Apparently, this is the zone in which an athlete can apply maximum effort for long periods of time without going insane.
