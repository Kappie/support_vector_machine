I almost crushed my pinky into a red sticky mess, experimenting with Compaq's new "tool-free" racking kits.  I guess pretending it was a lightsabre was partly to blame.  I've been spending so much time in comms rooms recently I am physically incapable of hearing the noise a fan makes anymore. This is not good. Bring on Cancun baby!
