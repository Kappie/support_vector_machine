Yep Mahen, Networking, CCNA paper I is over....I will most probably, be getting an "A" grade, i guess.....'coz i've been maintaining a consistent percentage in all my tests......yet to know the results......I told u,  right?....theory part is not that bad....but the practical part,  i found it very difficult......it needs lots of physical power....the worst part, is the termination of UTP cables.....God, it sucks!!!!....That's why,  i made up my mind, not to take CCNA Paper II next semmester......      Lot of issues going on abt music.....namakkum sangeethathukkum romba dhooram........      guess i'll give regular attendance for the next two weeks.......till i go back to school........               Happy Rakshabandan Ram........need to call my anna too.......else i'll have to miss some nice gift......  ok see u guys, bye.
