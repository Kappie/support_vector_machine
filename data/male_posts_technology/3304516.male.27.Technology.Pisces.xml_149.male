My heart goes out to the families of the 2 American civillians who were taken hostage and beheaded by heartless Al-Qaeda bastards. What kind of mindset could you possibly have to think that you are justified to cut off someone's head? These poor, sad, pathetic, loathsome, worthless, oxygen wasting fuckers really bother me. I think we should find the disgusting pukes who did this and go old testament on them, and do an eye for an eye, and cut off their worthless heads. I know that might take us down to their level but it's the only thing I can think of that is a fitting enough punishment.
