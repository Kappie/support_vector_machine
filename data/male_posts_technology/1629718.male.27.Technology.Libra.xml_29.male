Mom and dad are visiting either today or tommorrow, and staying for a day. Reason? Antique shops and a lil lookin around. I think i'll take em to golden corral for dinner, and they better like it for 10 bux a piece damnit lol.  Arg i gotta get my licence renewed, that sucks... i kinda liked the old way they looked, now im gonna have a bold, awsome, over 21 look on my licence, lol. Beer beer, yes kids, i love beer too. Bah!  Randy went to lunch before me today , damn oh well, i'm here till 6 anyways...heck of alot more refreshing when you get a late lunch from like 1:30 - 2:30 then 12-1 , to much damn traffic of first things, and for the rest , to much heat... lol  Hmmm what to eat for lunch, i think today it'll be Carl's Jr's or maybe some burger king, lawd knows! I'm kinda lavish for the taste of the chicken whopper, its just so damn good, but for 5 bucks a meal, it seems to be gettin a lil expensive. Yup br.king it is, i'll read the paper too...whit whew how i rock lol.  Well im off peace!  WCKED
