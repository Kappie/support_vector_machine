I certainly won't tell you about green snot, hacking coughs or any of the other excessively pleasant things that we are all experiencing. Hee hee.  Anyway, you are now administrator of The Mighty Blog. I look forwards to whatever scary technical things you care to inflict on us.  And now I'm going to join Kaia on the couch and pay worship to  urlLink Bert .
