(uh, feels just like a mother waiting to deliver her baby)...  Irrespective of whether I'll be released from the project or retained for the 1 month warranty period, atleast the work pressure should reduce, hopefully... so that I can be back to my old form...  Got a lot of things to tell about Valli's query... will post them peacufully next week...
