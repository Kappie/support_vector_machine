This quick fix has been attempted by many but only a select few have attained it. I am going to win the lottery. I got my ticket and it's a winner for sure. Five quick picks. How can I be so sure that I am going to win and still have to buy five tickets instead of one you ask? Well you're just going to have to figure that shit out on your own.  I didn't go to work today. My back is tweaked out again. I may be looking at back surgery again actually. I had the same surgery back in 2000. It did the trick then but it has since regressed.   I am moving soon, did I tell you that? I just have to get the hell out of where I am at. I will be moving out the Corona. This is by the Inland Empire for those of you who do not know. Just think Riverside area. This will be happening in Oct. I am going to be moving in with my friend Ron. This I am happy for. One of the reasons I have not moved yet is because I am really picky on who can live with me. I don't want my son around people drinking or smoking pot all day. To tell you the truth, I don't want to be around that either.  I used to work with Ron at an old job of mine. We were doing sales together then as he is still doing now. He is at another company though. Ron is an honest person and is great with Avery. All that I can ask for. He and I, in the seven years that we have known each other, have never fought about anything. I would live with him even after I win the lottery.  These are my thoughts for today. I will check in to let you know just how much I won.    Matt
