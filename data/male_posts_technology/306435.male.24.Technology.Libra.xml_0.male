I have lots of sleep and laundry coming my way..plus Ann's house is throwing a Cowboy party this Saturday...it should be interesting!  I am not used to having this many plans...  Last night Ann and I went to Sitwells, a coffee shop in the Clifton area of Cincinnati.  We had a grand time.  She told me all about her improv group, Don't Tell Anna.  It was a fun time.  We talked for a while and sipped on our coffee.  I had a Turtle Mocha...I remember when Kate young first showed me Sitwells and I would not drink coffee at all.  I would always order the same think...Mexicocoa (a hot chocolate with vanilla and sugar).  Everytime Kate and T would offer me sips of their fabulous coffess.  Finally, I liked one...the Turtle Mocha.  I especially like it when I add sugar.  Ann had Chai Milkshake.  She let me have some and it was pretty good.  I can honestly say I am not a fan of Chai, but this drink had the slightest hint of cinnamon that made me thik of oatmeal with cinnamon in it.  It is funny things the digfferences that Ann and I have.  Television for one thing.  I love television.  I can watch three shows at one time easy.  Ann and television are not so much. One would think that would be a bad combination, but I thkn it is cool.  You don't always want to be with like people...then you have nothing to talk about.  **** WARNING ANN DO NOT READ *****  Fantasy Sports update:  At weeks beginning I was seven games behind Jim in the baseball fanatasy sports league and now I am only one game back.  I just need to earn two more points and I am playoff bound.  Put'em on the board YES!  Okay, Ann it is safe to read this...  I really have nothing else to talk about...until then...
