Mostly frogs are found but every once in a while you stumble upon a live  urlLink pterodactyl .  The common explanation for these occurances is similar to the way Winnie the Pooh ended up stuck in Rabbit's hole ... so to speak.  But then again they may be reincarnations of those  urlLink stuck  in one of the outer circles of Buddhist hell.
