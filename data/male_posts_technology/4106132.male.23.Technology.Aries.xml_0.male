Idlewild are one of my favourite bands  today I was them play for the 3rd time. It was amazing. Ast time they were over, they were promoting their album  so only really played stuff from that. This time, with their new album not out until next year sometime (Roddy's reason for this being: "I'm in no rush" - brilliant), they played a selection of all their music to date. It was fantastic.  I'm heading to dublin tomorrow - I originally wasn't going to go - even at dinnertime today I'd decided against going - but then Idlewild played  they are playing tomorrow so there's no way I'm not going. I'll be able to put up with anyone tomorrow if it's half as good a gig. It's quite a lineup - The Frames, Idlewild, Bell X1, Supergrass  Halite (who supported Idlewild tonight  were a bit mediocre).  Also got tickets to go and see Ben Folds in Dublin in November today - happy days.  So today was a great day musically - I'm still on a bit of a high from it.  The only down point of the day being work - but even there I had a bit of a laugh with my mates.  Bring on tomorrow - here's hoping everything goes alright with my friends :S
