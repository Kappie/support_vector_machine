Happened to watch two wonderful movies last week......one was "Mrs  Mr Iyer".......An Indian movie.....The hero's nativity is said as Bengal,  the heroin's  is from TamilNadu....So they communicate in English, with tit bits of tamil  hindi inbetween..... for our convinience, we get close captions when the dialouge is in Hindi or Tamil.....The whole movie is about a journey, from the deep south to Calcutta.......It was simply wonderful.....  The other movie was "Bend it like Beckham"......an Indian(Punjabi) family in London tries to raise their soccer-playing daughter in a traditional way.......Her dream is to play soccer professionally like her hero David Beckham.......Does her parents allow her to chase her dream or ties her with family values and stuffs??....This is the whole stroy about...The director is Gurinder Chadha(who's given one another hit..."Bhaji on the beach")...This movie was a sleeper hit in England.....a late pick up....but recieved an overwhelming response.....Now, picking up speed in America too......Don't ever miss a chance to watch these wonderful movies......  Kicha, so at what time u'll be at my home?....this week end we are celebrating Diwali, right????........
