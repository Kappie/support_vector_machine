(Or as normal as they get around here..)  Bubbles has been working on a new section for the site.. Random hot chicks we've seen around Dublin. A.K.A. Girls we'd like to fúck..  Also I am scanning in photos from the first of several disposable cameras bubbles has violated in the last week or two :) Can't wait to see some of THOSE pictures ;)  Have kinda stopped going to Hip-Hop classes for the moment, but have started going to Salsa 3 times a week.. *Raises eyebrow, swings head in Bubbles directions and assumes the "I dare you to open your mouth right now" pose, then turns to omnipod and says "same goes for you monkey-boy"* If I keep this up I'll be ready to leave the beginers class sometime in Q4 2003!! ;) (While on the subject of  urlLink Salsa,  Josh, change the font from Comic sans to Verdana Size 2.. GWAN.. You know it makes sense :))  *Hears Jonny make some smart comment about Salsa and Mikes sexual persuasion and throws a hardback book at the  urlLink little hitler * Actually.. I have to say, jonny really reminds me of Sadam from the Southpark movie as well for some reason.. "I can change, I love you.." Jonny, you buggered satan at all recently or have you not seen bubbles in a while? *Assumes a rock-like stance and gives Jonny the universal signal for "Just bring it"*  Actually no, I don't.. Jonny, you rock..  hehe hehe hehe  OK Enough flame baiting for now.. I'm off so you can go away now..  Oh Yeah, Bubbles get your cock out of omnipods ass for long enough to show him how to do those damn basic steps.. On Tuesday, we IMPROVE!  Go away now
