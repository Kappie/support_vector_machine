I am thinking to begin some GNOME hacking but that's kinda hard becose GNOME is written in C and gtk+. But I know only GTKmm and not GTK+. Muust find some GNOME projects build with GTKmm.  Also sown a MSDN TV movie that shows some cool XAML and Avalon features. Windows Longhorn will bi pretty cool. Maybe I'll use it but still be a Linux developer :--)
