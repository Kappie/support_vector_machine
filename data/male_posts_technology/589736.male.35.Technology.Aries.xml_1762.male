It would kind of *look* like the flag, but not really *be* the flag, thus keeping all true flags safe.  One could even market it as the Safe Protest Flag, and sell it at convenience stores.  Or, one could perform a "Flag Threatening," in which a protestor holds a flag *close* to an open flame, but does not catch it on fire, thus conveying one's emotion without actual destruction of the object.  Perhaps the apprehension an observer might feel watching such an act would yield the same impact as actual destruction.
