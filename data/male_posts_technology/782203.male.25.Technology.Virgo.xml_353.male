It was pretty cool, he actually mixed a drink for me , i forgot what it was called, sounds like pepsi-cola ...he's a bartender you see.  Anyway it was really nice catching up with him cos I haven't seen him for like 6 months. Oh and he lent me a whole stack of CDs, VCDs and porn CDs to bring back, I didn't really want the porn CDs being the decent innocent guy that I am, but it's not really nice to refuse a guy on his birthday so I reluctantly accepted.  Ok going to watch them right now. Oh and he was also nice enough to lend me his guitar book, hopefully I can finally learn to play one.    Oh and before I forget, happy birthday michelle  !
