And, of course, all people can talk about is what's going to happen with Ross and Rachel.    Am I alone in the world of Friends' fans in that I couldn't care LESS what happens to Ross?  I was seriously hoping for Rachel and Joey to get together, or hell, even Rachel and Phoebe.  Ross annoys the living piss out of me.  If he was someone I ran into at work, I'd probably hate his guts.  But no, America's all agog about the possibility of Ross and Rachel getting together finally, and you know that NBC isn't going to do something smart like let Ross get run over by a bus or something.    Well, as much as I'll miss Chandler and Joey, I guess it's okay for Friends to be ending.  The show has pretty much done all it can, and they've done it with class, style, and some pretty great comedy.    Now  John Doe , on the other hand...
