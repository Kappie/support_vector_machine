John -- SciFi is not the issue -- access to the VCR is. See, with the jury-rigged set up I have going so I can use the damned cable box  and  the picture-in-picture feature of my beloved TV, I had to set up the VCR so that you watch what you tape. And since I am outnumbered and surrounded in the scifi fan department up here, Saddam's got a better chance of scoring a town home on South Beach in Miami than I have in taping the durned thing. I'll replace the tape(s), if you would be so kind!  Let's see Harmony -- are you trying to tell us that the US Army should be wiped out by a sandstorm?
