It was nice to see that I remembered whatever the hell I learned there because if I didn't that would be pathetic.  We discussed everything from what a network was to IP addressing.  Going into the class I was just cringing on what the class would look like.  Let me digress.  I had an image of what my next girl would be like and she would be as follows.  She had to be cute, geeky and smart plus shorter than me.  Very superficial indeed but then again I was just discussing looks.  So going back to the class.  I was cringing because I thought it would be all guy geeks and nerds and yeah, it would be bad.  Lo and behold I get there and take my seat reading the text provided when this short asian cute geeky girl walks in.  So damn cute.  Face was cute, had a killer body.  She was short and oh my, just soooo damn adorable.  I had a crush that very moment.  So we got to talking and I found out that she works for IBM as a technical sales person for their product line for Tivoli Storage Manager.  So class started and blah blah blah.  Lecture upon lecture upon lecture.  Lunch time came and I invited her to go to lunch.  We went to this little bistro down the street.  She seemed like a good girl.  Very polite, had a cute laugh.  Smile was adorable and man.  I just wanted to take her home and have her meet the family.  She was training for a triathalon so that is why she had a kickin' bod.  Found out that she couldn't ride a bike yet.  funny considering I thought everyone could ride a bike already.  Turns out she lives in Austin, TX.  That's a little far for weekend driving huh?  I what she was doing for Thursday night but I didn't have the balls.  Damn it!  Friday came and we talked some more during break.  I asked is she was staying for the whole weekend but I guess not.  She said normally if it wasn't a holiday weekend she would be here till Sunday but oh well.  Lunchtime came and I asked what she was doing but she was going to lunch with one of her girlfriends that just recently moved to Chicago.  DAMN!!!  She was going to do the tourist thing.  Man, I missed out on that one.  She said that she was going to be back in Chicago for the summer for more training so I gave her my email address for when she comes back.  I won't hold my breath.  Friday night was all about Rainbow Six 3 (RS3).  I played till fucking 3 in the morning.  Yes, I turned into a bigger geek.  There are a lot of good players out there and it's amazing how much you learn playing with them.  From peeking around corners to pressing the cround button while reloading, yeah there are definitely a lot of little things that will help you stay alive in that game long enough to contribute to your team (I play mostly Team Survival).  I did the exact same thing Saturday night after getting home from the bar.  Played till about 4 AM.  Sunday night I played till fucking 4:45.  There was already light out when I quit playing.  It was bad.  Interesting thing though is ESPN did a little story about gaming and how it is turning into big money these days.   urlLink Team 3D  is one of the top teams with a lot of spnsorship money and prize winnings that this is what they do.  They play video games for money and live off their winnings and sponsorships.  They travel the world to compete against other nerds!  Speaking of which, I found a great little all girl team  urlLink Angels of Impact .  An all girl gaming clan that plays Counter Strike.  I guess they are pretty good since their record reflects that (unless they play against shitty teams...).  My favorite so far is this cute blonde  urlLink Brittney .  I mean that smile and the hat cocked sideways and plays a FPS game.  Shit!  So cute.  there are other girls there that are cute as well but she is my favorite so far.   urlLink Ani  is damn fine as well.  This weekend was filled with a lot of eating and RS3.  I also lost like 10 pounds since last weekend.  I don't know what the hell is going on but hey, I'll take it.  Another 10-15 and then I'll be happy.  So a brand new week is here.  It's a good thing it is Thursday.  I gotta get back into the swing of things here at work considering I had Thursday and Friday pretty much off.  Yay for my boss for scheduling me to go to class the two days before Memorial Day weekend.  Thanks boss!
