The day it happened I was kind of in shock.  I heard a bit of disturbance on the radio as I got out of my car going into work at 9:00.  When I was inside the office and heard people tlaking of two planes crashing in New York.  I didn't think much about it at first...not until I heard "they hit the Pentagon!"  I kept up with my job, but was severly numb.  I have never gone through anything like this.  The closest thing for me would be the Gulf War which took place while I was in the sixth grade...all of which seemed to much like a movie.  In fact the scenes I saw later that day were much like thatof a movie, only this time there was no hero running to the plane's cockpit to eventually win out.   I have been very interested in the proceedings over the last few days.  How people react and why they react to something.  I was very glad my mom called me while I was at work.  That was very comforting. I am going home next weekend.  THe big St. X Trinity game is on the horizon.  It should be fun.  I am not sure if Ann is going to come or not.   She is gladly invited and it would give all the people in Louisville a chance to meet her...especially Kristin who does nothing nbut ask about her...  Other than that not too much more has been going on...  Until then...
