Since we we're having arguements before that, I obviously thought he wasn't just playing the game. It is hard to be an admin and a friend to the same person. Especially someone like steven.  I deleted the post and told them to stop making fun of me.  Lance made a really big deal about it and I really didn't even think about it.  Supposedly everyone was making fun of everyone, but i didn't read the whole thing, which made me sound selfish. but. Steven wouldn't have argued if it was another admin besides one of his friends. That was the ONLY post I had ever deleted. I don't edit posts, I add to them. But, i couldn't handle it. My mind was on survival mode and that freaking proxy server program didn't WORK!  So I took the easy way out, for once.  It hurts...really none of my friends have apreciated what I've done, I don't think I have ever heard a thank you from any of them. None of them notice how I feel. And I AM STILL THE "selfish" ONE!  what the hell, this isn't worth it.
