I try my best to do what's right and while I may not always manage to do that I never intentionaly hurt anyone and will always try and repair any damage or hurt I have done to anyone.  I am still best friends with my last 3 Ex's... Who do you know that can say that? The break up of a relationship is usually about as hurtfull as you can get and so far I have managed to repair most of the hurt I have caused. And anyone who knows me (I mean anyone who really knows me) knows that they can ALWAYS come to me with any gripe and I will do any and every thing I can to try and repair the damage.. So much so that I have often ended up doing more than I should for people that don't really deserve it but to me it will always be worth it to try and fix a friendship..  Even with all this and all the effort I try to make life still keeps kicking me in the balls.. Just when I think things are finally starting to come together and that life may actually start to feel like something other than a struggle along something comes out of no-where and kicks me in the teeth. Yesterday I found out something that was so horrible I still haven't quite come to terms with it. I actually can't believe it is happening. I've spent the last 2 days on the verge of tears. I haven't been this upset for as long as I can remember and it came from somewhere I never expected.  I feel like shit.. I feel like giving up.. I can't make sense of anything anymore and it's just plain SHIT.
