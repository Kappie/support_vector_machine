I used once to go to the GYM and work out my muscles, and to the pool.. I miss these days a lot. Now, I spend most of my time on the computer, chatting, studying, surfing the net and eating..  a lot . I have been trying to avoid the refrigerator, but I cant help it! I'm in love with it.. It's a luring world, full of attractive places, has some kind of passion, magic,.. Something that I cant explain.  This is like talking about sex, portraying. God, I eat like a pig.   So every day is the same as the one before! fuckin' routine. I think I need a challenge or maybe go shopping, this might help, I guess. Anyway, that's about all, I think I better go study a bit.
