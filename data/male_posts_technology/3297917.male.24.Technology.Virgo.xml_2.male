I was an idiot this weekend and put off finishing a presentation for class till the last minute.  Saturday having work in the morning then going out with my friend Kelly to see her brother's band play at Nation (her bro's band is pretty decent!).  So Saturday was rather unproductive.    So then came sunday...had a midterm in the morning that i fortunately still got an A on even though i didn't get to study as much as i wanted. (having 2 4 hour classes on sundays sucks!) Then after i got out of class I got an invite to go see Van Hellsing (mmmm Kate Beckensale).  We were SUPPOSED to go see a 6:30 show but since my friends are lazy asses we didn't get to go see it till the 9:50pm show. *sigh  So all and all i've been exhausted the last week.  Lets count 34 hours of standing on my feet dealing with idiot mason sudents at near minimun wage.  12 hours of class...a midterm to study for, 2 projects that needed finishing, and more social engagements than i really had time for. Yeah...fun week.  So i called out of work today so i could get my presentation done, and i didn't actually get finished till 9:45pm. (yes i get destracted easily) and in the process totally forgot i made plans to hang out with someone else tonight. At least she forgot too so all's well and good. :)  ~Mike
