After that went shopping for my mom's gift for tommorow - got her this pretty nice handbag. Well she picked it out, I just paid half the dough. Shopping for handbags doesn't really rate highly on my list of fun things to do.   After that I met a friend , we bought a couple of beers from 7-11 and hanged out at the beach to talk and stuff. Had a really good time - we just talked and talked and talked.  I have always preferred quiet places compared to pubs and clubs but  for some reason chicks are hesitant to go to secluded places with me.  What's up with that !?
