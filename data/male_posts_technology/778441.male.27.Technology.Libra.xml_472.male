It looks a bit different, operates more efficiently, has a few more features and costs less.   This new baby is thinner and sports a new menu that feels like the one on the iPod mini. The battery-life has been extended. There are new features like multiple on-the-go playlists and playback of audiobooks at variable speeds. But the best thing is its price. A whopping $100 reduction in the prices (across the board) mean that the iPod is all set to ramp up its existing share of 50% of the digital music player market.  Now... I can think of buying myself one! ;-)
