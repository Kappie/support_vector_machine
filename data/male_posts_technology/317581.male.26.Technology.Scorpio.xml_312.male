Or Cell Phone users, little kids running around/talking/kicking seats/crying, laser pointer users, etc. They should all be summarily smacked by everyone else in the audience on they're way out. Kinda like that movie commercial that shows the person getting pegged by stuff while talking on a cell phone.
