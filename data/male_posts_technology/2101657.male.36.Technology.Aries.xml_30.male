A neighbor had her car burried, so I did the back end of her car, almost to the bumper. Figure she didn't have that much to shovel then, and I was drenched in sweat from the 30ft of street to the korner that I had done already.   So what does this neighbor do? She parks in front of OUR house, and leaves the area around her car untouched.  She backed up and left, and when she came back, parked in our clean spot.  Granted, streets are considered 1st come 1st serve for parking, even if you cleaned the spot out.  BUT, when a neighbor, w/o asking is nice enough to clean 80% of the area around your car, you think they could do the rest themselves.    So I went out and did most of what was left, before getting fed up with the situation. Yesterday, it was being nice and courteous, but today after they cant do their own space, she wants it done, it's $ time.   IIt's kinda fun to do, to be honest, but it's still hot work.  Z*lda and the lady up-stairs both left notes on her windshield complaining.  Thats my 2cents worth for the day.
