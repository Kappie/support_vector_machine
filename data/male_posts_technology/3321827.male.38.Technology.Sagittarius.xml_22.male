Rather than teachers spending the time TEACHING the subjects that the students are tested on, they coach them on the standardized tests that judge performance.  What a great use of time.  So when the students enter the workforce, they still don't know crap...but they can certainly pass the standardized test that judges teacher/school performance....and the best part is that the teachers keep their jobs!!!!  This quote says it all, "...But others say they put an enormous amount of pressure on teachers to make sure students pass, because if they don't, the whole school might end up facing consequences."  Personal accountability for teachers/schools?  NEVER.  It's not fair!  It's too much pressure...whine, whine, whine.  If the NEA would spend as much time teaching students as they did whining, we'd put out the best students in the world.    You don't hear private school teachers whine about performance-based testing.  Why?  Because keeping their job is based on Performance!  Tenure is near meaningless.  Competition creates performance.  They are up to the challenge.  Private schools RAISE standards and require student performance.  The NEA corrupts young teachers and adds them to the whining bureaucracy that performs inefficiently and lowers standards in order to make themselves look better.  More to follow.
