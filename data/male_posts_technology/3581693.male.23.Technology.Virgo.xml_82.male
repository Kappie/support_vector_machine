So the evening starts with a group of friends - enjoying some laughs at a downtown comedy club. Many drinks were consumed - many a gut was burst.  It was after 12 when the group of hott youngin's returned to a downtown hotel, where much more booze was consumed. The group embarked on a somewhat lackluster game of Truth or Dare. One by one they fell asleep. Alas, there was but two left - it's now 4 am.  One friend - we'll call him J - asks his friend S if he wants to go get some breakfast. Unable to sleep, S willingly obliges. So they enter the lobby of the hotel and ask the concierge "what's a good place for breakfast?" - "McDonalds serves a mean breaky he replies" - S  J decide to find something a little easier on the old tum tum - so off they go - out into the rain.  J walking slightly ahead of S. It wasn't but a second before a sharpely dress young man spoke up and asked J "are you Mr. Green?" Without missing a beat - J replied "yes that's me." "Okay, right this way sir." Up goes the umbrella and he's escourted through the door of a limo. S, not wanting to second guess J's judgement, hops right in after him.   Driver "Will you be bringing any bags?"  Mr. Green "No no, they'll be travelling separately."  Driver closes the trunk and hops in.  Mr. Green "Could you please put the divider up? We'd like some privacy."  Driver complies, starts the car and starts driving.  S looks at Mr. Green - simply starts laughing. It's too early to think.   S "Where are we going?"  Mr. Green "I have no idea. I'll ask him to drive through McDonalds"  S "No - you can't do that" (S always the voice of reason).  Mr. Green "How do I turn on the radio?"   They start playing with things. Eventually get the radio going, air conditioning turned way up. They sit back an enjoy the ride. Both of them completely relaxed at this point - no idea where they're heading.  Their minds begin to ponder - Mr. Green "I bet we're going to the airport"  S "Oh, I bet we're going to be taken right out on to the air strip - the jet will be waiting."  Mr. Green "Ok - if that's the case - we just keep walking - get on the plane and go - don't look back. This'll be like a chance for a new beginning."  S "Ok. But what if the real Mr. Green was a made man - and we're going to be taken to some mob bosses place and off'd?"  Mr. Green looks at S - "Ok Mr. Mustard let's not get carried away - I don't wanna have to ask the driver to stop off and get me some rope before taking us to the library."  Now a good 20 minutes have passed. This is about the time it takes to get from downtown to the airport. Sure enough they can see the airport.  All of a sudden there's a knock on the divider.  Mr. Mustard "Dude, he's knocking."  Mr. Green "No he's not."  Knock knock...  Mr. Mustard "Yes he is."  Mr. Green turns down the radio and opens the divider. "Yeah what's up?"  Driver "You're not Mr. Green. The Green party never got picked up. I just got a call from my boss."  Mr. Green "You're kidding me. That's impossible. I'm Mr. Green."  Driver "Well there's a Mr. Green who called my boss stating he never got his limo."  Mr. Green "So, wait. There's two Mr. Greens - expecting to get picked up at the same time. This is unbelievable. What are the chances. All I know is that my parents told me to get up, into a limo and out to the airport for flight 151. I don't ask questions, I just do it. Everything was prepaid."  Note: the car is still moving...  Driver "Nothing was prepaid. You have to pay for this when I drop you off."  Mr. Green "That's impossible. I don't have any money on me."  Driver "Well then I'll have to let you out right here" (Somewhere along the side of the road).  Mr. Green "I'm not paying for this thing. This isn't my limo. I don't know who you are or where you're from but you better let me out right now. If you go five more feet this will be kidnapping. Stop the car."  The care doesn't stop.  Mr. Green "Stop the car. I want to talk to the Canadian authorities. I'm an American. I want you to take me to the embassy."  Driver "You want to talk to the RCMP?"  Mr. Green "Yes - take me to the authorities. The RCMP!"  Driver "There's one right here."  Mr. Mustard "Oh Sh*t!"  The limo pulls into a gas station where there is an RCMP car being filled up.   The driver jumps out. Mr Green jumps out and follows him to the officer and they start talking to him through the window.  Mr. Mustard hangs out around the shop - talking to the locals - then dashes inside (for the warmth).  Mr. Green "This man has kidnapped me. He picks us up. Doesn't check who we are - just starts driving and taking us where he wants. Totally unacceptable. I have no phone. I have no money. I'm stuck."  Driver "Here, you can use my phone to call your parents and see what they booked."  Mr Green reluctantly takes the phone and starts dialing random numbers - with no success. "I've had enough - you're going to make me late for my flight - I'm going to get my friend."  Comes into the shop while signalling for Mr. Mustard to hide out of sight.   Mr. Green "I need $42 to pay for the limo." Now realizing that this is not just going to go away.  Mr. Mustard "I've only got $20."  Mr. Green "That's fine give it to me... take my wallet and phone - I've told them I don't have any so I don't want them to find it on me."  Mr. Green takes the money out to the limo driver who is all of a sudden his best friend again. "Now take us to the airport. You've nearly spoiled our honeymoon. I won't let you do any more damage."  They get to the airport and the limo driver opens the doors.  Mr. Green "Hey buddy let me ask you something. Is your job worth $40? Cause this just cost you your job. Say hi to your wife for me when you're stuck working at 7-11!" And the two young highjackers head inside for breakfest.  Unable to find what they were looking for near American departures they start heading for a timmies in Domestic departures. Uncertain of how they are going to get home they get on their cell phones and start calling friends. Who happens to be walking towards them but the RCMP officer.  RCMP "Gentlemen, American departures are in that end" Points in the opposite direction.  Mr. Green "Well you know what we missed our flight because of that whole ordeal."  RCMP "Oh yeah, well why don't you come with me and we'll get this sorted out. What flight were you on?"  Mr. Green "Oh 151... " Mr. Green continues to talk leaving the officer no choice but to suspect something is up.   Mr. Mustard "Ok I think it's time you come clean this has gone far enough." Not wanting to get arrested - of course.  Mr. Green "Ok Ok" - Explains the whole story to the officer. Officer now smiling. "Surely when you were 21 you did the same thing?"  Now he wants to check both Mr. Green and Mr. Mustard for warrants. (At this point they start using their real names).   S gets the 1010 all clear... and after some fixing of information - so does J.  Officer says happily (obviously going to bust a gut later) "Ok guys - Behave!"  Now S  J have to get a taxi (as they just missed the bus) back to the hotel to return the key... thus ends a wild night of good times!
