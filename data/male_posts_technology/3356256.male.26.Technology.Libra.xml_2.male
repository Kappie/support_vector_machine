Well at least it's my last evening here at work... I really do miss having a "normal" life.  It's been 4 years since I've started working the graveyard shift and it's starting to get to me. To the point that I'm alway's tired.  My friends know that the moment I sit on their couch I pass out and then it's quite hard to  wake me up.  I really need to leave this place!!!
