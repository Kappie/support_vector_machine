I've been silly busy, and only had a small amount of time to go kill-crazy on  urlLink Enter The Matrix . If you've been living under a rock, this is the PC/Console game released in time with the Matrix Reloaded. (Which is on TOMORROW... HOLY CRAP! I'VE SOILED MYSELF!) *ahem* anyway.. yeah, so it's pretty good.. except a few things about the PC version that really piss me off.   Like the large crappy white font that displays your health and focus meters. The console version looks much schweeter. Also if you minimize the bastard, it won't restore which is really annoying. Some git is having a better Matrix experience on a PS2 or XBox which cost the same as my freaking graphics card. Gits. I hope they patch the niggly problems. However the combat kicks ass! You can chop-socky SWAT teams left, right and center, run around in bullet-time and jump off walls, etc. I've still waiting for Trinity's pixelated bottom to dance the lambada across my screen though.  It's a stop-gap anyway because PlanetSide should be down soon so we'll all be blasting each other on that. Lock and load soliders!  If you're a sick puppy like me, you'll love  urlLink Happy Tree Friends!
