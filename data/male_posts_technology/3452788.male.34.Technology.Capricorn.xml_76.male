The times when we most need someone's comfort is the time when we are least able to receive it, pushing our loved ones away, or give comfort to others who need it.  What I really need is to just lay down and be held all weekend, talk out problems, be loved by someone who understands this hell.  Instead, we will be occupoed with busy-tasks all weekend long, and I will be resentful and bitter the whole time.   I know most people think of me as cold, uncaring, unconcerned with other's problems.  If it didn't hurt so much to take care of myself, I would do more for others.  I would love to feel good enough and strong enough to be able to do more to help other people.  I want to be able to show love to my family all the time.  I just can't do it right now.  Either they understand, or they don't.
