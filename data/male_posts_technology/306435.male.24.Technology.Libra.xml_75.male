I thikn any medicine that tastes nasty should only have to be taken once.  I got my pager back yesterday.  Wednesday it just sort of beepe and died on me.  No biggie I guess.  They sent a new one and I sent the old one back.    Didn't do too much yesterday.  Watched Survivor (yes, I taped it for you Ann).  I took a nap yesterday too.  I hate taking naps during the day.  I never feel rested the next night.   Man my head is starting to hurt again...
