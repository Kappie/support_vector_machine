Jackie Chan in talks with government to construct a Jackie Chan village in Hong Kong over the next ten years  by Wu Chi Ming 2003.11.17  Jackie Chan took interviews with a few Japanese newspapers the other day, and revealed plans to cooperate with the Hong Kong government to construct a village (the Jackie village!) in ten years time.  The village could have a Jackie Chan museum and a movie themed park.  Jackie Chan's "Shanghai Knights" opened the day before yesterday in Japan.  But because he was hard at work on "New Police Story, Jackie was unable to promote the movie in person.  But he still attracted a large number of Japanese media who arrived in Hong Kong to interview him.  He accepted interviews from "Sports Daily" and "Sankei Sports" and disclosed his planned construction of the Jackie village in Hong Kong.  Each part of the facility [would be world class.]  Jackie Chan said, "...I plan a Jackie village!  Besides having a movie themed park, we could have a theater, a [sports area?] and a Jackie museum.  Jackie had originally had this idea on his mind for several years.  He said, "Although Jackie Village is still in the planning stage, there has already been four or five meetings with the Hong Kong government.  The final plan isn't in cement yet, and I can't disclose details.  It was a secret!  There are still a lot of plans for the project.  Moreover, from the beginning until now it's been about two or three years.  I believe in order to complete the project it would take ten years!"  A few years ago there were rumors of plans to construct a Jackie Chan museum in Yokohama, but the plan was stopped.  Now Jackie has regained hope.  http://www.the-sun.com.hk/channels/ent/20031117/img/c21117_big.jpg
