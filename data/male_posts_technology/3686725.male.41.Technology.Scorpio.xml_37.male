Okay, so there'll always be the ubiquitous "easy target": the white male duffus (and, no, that is  not  redundant).  But, c'mon, Ray Ramano has adequately replaced the void left by Tim Allen. But there must be some minority group we can really stick it to, right?  Well, leave it to UPN to find SOMEbody we can still debase and exploit:  urlLink the Amish . It'll be like  urlLink Kingpin  meets  urlLink The Real World .  It sounds awful.  And, yes, I probably will tune in but I'm not proud of that.
