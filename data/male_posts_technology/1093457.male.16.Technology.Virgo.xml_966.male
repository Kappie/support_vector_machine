Thinking of doing the IMAX for my birthday but not sure at the moment. What do you think? After the film (you'll all be proud of me for this! I am!!!) I went into the leather shop and asked them about the Matrix Reloaded jacket they have in the window. He let me try it on! Woooooooooooo! And it suited me! Honest it did! I WILL be saving up for it. Trust me. I'm going to Spain on the art trip. Wahoo!
