The Mavs scored the winning run in the bottom of the seventh on a bases loaded wild pitch.  The 3-2 score made it the closest game in Mavs history.  The second game was not as pretty.  The Mavs took it on the chin 12-4.  The rubber game of the three game series will be completed on Sunday.    I went 2-4 with  2 RBIs and 2 BBs for the day.    My pitching stats did not look as good.  I entered in the second game already losing 6-2.  I went 3 up and 3 down with 2 strike outs in the first inning worked.  The first batter faced in the second inning fouled off about 15 pitches.  my arm was done.  A few "Should have been outs" later my runs allowed was matching that of Jimmy Haynes.  With no other pitchers to go to, I was in for the long haul.  It is okay though.  I think I proved I am more of a closer type pitcher and not a long guy.    Speaking of baseball, check out my  urlLink MoBlog  for the Ken Griffey Jr homerun picture I took.  Okay, it is about 30 seconds after the fact, but give me a break I am new at the camera phone thing.
