The books are really something else, and the 1st two movies are excellent.  I wish I could say the same for the 3rd movies adaption of the book.  I was dissapointed to the EXTREME to say the least.  They left an incredible amount of information out that is vital to the story, changed various things around location wise, made changes to BIG things in the story like, having so-n-so say them instead of who should have.  They added stuff into the story that wasn't there in the first place, and didn't put in stuff that in my opinion is crucial to the plot and over-all story.  I'm amazed that J.K. Rolling let them do this to the story and I hope to Gaea that she doesn't let them do the same thing to "The Goblet of Fire".  Some of the filming styles were quite well, I'll admit that some of the scenes were nice with the way they were filmed, some of the HUGE changes to the grounds of Hogwarts was unacceptable.  I won't say anything for awhile, as I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone.    I just came out feeling very let down, like an old-friend had just cheated me.  Such is life I guess...
