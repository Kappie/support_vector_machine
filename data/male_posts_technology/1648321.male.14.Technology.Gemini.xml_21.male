I have a soccer game as usual on Saturday morning at 11:00 am, and I have tennis at around 1:00 pm. Luckily, I don't have much homework. We had a big unit test yesterday in Math (I hope I passed and at least got some sort of B). Today is an easy day since it is a B day. In English, we already read a book called "Jemmy." Now we are reading "Four Miles to Pinecone." Both stories take place in Minnesota. My fish, so called "Dragon" is still alive. I can't believe how long he has lived. For about 3 or 4 months now. So is Kelly's "Flower" fish. Both are Betas in little jars. I try to feed them every other 1 or 2 days. I clean the bowls every week. Well, I think this is a long enough post.
