It's a very challenging course to walk, due to all the steep inclines, but it's a fun work out.  We've thinking of going again today, due to the nice weather, and having the day off for Good Friday.    While playing Wednesday, I almost lost my Innova "StingRay".  Was the 7th hole, and I had what I thought was an excellent throw.  I thought I saw where it landed, and then the boys threw their discs.  We moved down the fareway, and I started going to where I thought my disc had landed.  Whoops! Where'd it go!  We spent probably 20-25 minutes looking around for it. Then, for the first time, I decided to just play on and call it a loss.  We played the 8th, and then the 9th/10th play back along the way we came.  So I kept my eyes peeled and looking, just in-case.  Woohoo!! There it is, it had landed, and at an odd angle to spot from up where we had been.  So I've yet to lose a disc, but came very close.  I had just got done telling the oldest son, that it would be a beautiful day Thursday, and with a nice afternoon sunshine coming down, that it would be real obvious to anyone to find.  Luckly we found it first.  Can't wait, it's 52, should be a great day at the course! :-)  Will post some pics of our trip, so show what the course looks like.
