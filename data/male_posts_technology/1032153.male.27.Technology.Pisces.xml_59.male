It's getting very nice. So to all those who mock.... watch out, because butter mince is coming to a restaurant near you.   Person of the Week  Jono is person of the week this week! Very thoughtfully invited me around this week, when I was feeling down, and we just hung. Was real good. Thanks Jono, you made my day.   Wuthering Heights  Have just begun reading Wuthering Heights for the 5th (I think). I really enjoy... hehe. Really?!   Bill English  I was really impressed with Bill English and his stand against Euthanasia. It's a pity that we have fallen so far in this nation that  a decent moral bloke cannot get support, while a godless (and anti-God) woman can take the country down a road to the devil. While I'm not saying Bill is a Christian (although he may well claim to be and is a Catholic). I am trying to differentiate between leadership which leads directly away from moral foundations, and leadership while not Christian, still has a moral conscience. Examples of both can be found in the Old Testament. I'm probably not making much sense as I am really tired, I'll try to explain next time.
