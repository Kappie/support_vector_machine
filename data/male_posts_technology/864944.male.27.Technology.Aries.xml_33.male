About a month ago i was at work doing nothing when my heart went into an ahhrythmia.  Very fast beating, and i had symptoms that seemed like a heart attack.   I went to the ER, and there they did a bunch of tests, all of which showed that i had a healthy heart.  After the initial "incident", i had a second "incident" but it was a bit less severe.  It turns out that while my heart was beating fast the other symptoms i had appear to have been indiciative of a panic attack.  As if to drive the point home, i had a mid sized panic attack at our condo closing ;p    So a month later, and the doc has me on a small amount of anti-anxiety medication to help me get over the hyper-sensitive feelings im having about my heart etc.   Long and short.. im fine, nothing serious.    Now... to give some more detail about other random things in life.. since its been a while...  ---- The cat is  NOT  happy about the boxed being everywhere.  She has in recent months begun to come out more when strangers are around, and I suspect we will revert her back to her isolationist mode when we move her.  Poor thing.  ---- Our weekly poker game is still rockin on.  We have been enjoying it greatly as a way for us to see our friends.. and take their money. (or more accurately GIVE them money!).  Of particular note, a friend of minde from work who had always watched poker from afar, but never played, got into it wiht us, and he has since surpassed us.   He plays online and has won several tournaments (no limit hold 'em) and even won a trip to Aruba to play in the World Poker Tour.    He also has been heading to Foxwoods on a semi-regular bais, and when visiting his brother, he played in the SouthWest recently.   The man is a machine.   All of us like poker, and we're all ok, but THIS guy is seriously PRO material.   I hope he is able to make the jump one day.. or at least keep it going as a fun and exciting way to earn a second income.     ----  On the gaming front:  Unreal Tournament 2004 's demo came out.  AMAZING.  THat game is terribly fun, and chris and I already have our copys pre-ordered.   Another friend of mine hosts lan partys and this is sure to be a regular there.  GREAT GAME.  Try the  urlLink demo  if you have not.   Chris and I are still playing  urlLink Horizons , though admittedly it has slowed quite a bit with the move and such.  Hopefully once we're all settled in, we can get more play time and get more into the game again.   It has its weaknesses, but overall its pretty solid.  My only beef withthe game is that it seems that grouping in the game is a bit harder than other games we've played.   Then again... if all goes well with a content update in march, the dragon i play shoudl be able to get the gift of flight.  BOOYA!   I'm still rockin with  urlLink WWIIOnline .  THis game again suffers from my attention span flopping all over with one game or another, but i dont think i'll ever cancel my account with it, as no matter how long between sessions, i always get on and have a great time. The latest patch adds visual damage modeling to aircraft, which is something the game has been missing since the beginning.   I mean.. when i shoot down a plane, nothing is more gratifying than seeing a wing shear off as the vehicle goes tumbling back to earth.  MMM good times.    Ground vehicle visual damage modeling is also coming in the near future.. so all is well there.  Games on the horizon:  UT2004 Full release: yum Half Life 2: wow.. this one can' come soon enough. Ultima X Odyssy: this is the new ultima online.. I think it will be sweet City of Heros:  Massivley mutiplayer online superheros.  what more can i say. Doom 3:  This game should be coming in the next quarter or 2.  It looks to be scary.   Guess thats it for now.  Thanks for reading, and expect the massive email about a change of address / phone number in the not too distant future.
