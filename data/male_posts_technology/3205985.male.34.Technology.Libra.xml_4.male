We had one night which was our first "date" night since Emily was born. It was very nice, but we splurged and went out to a very fancy dinner. We had a cocktail, appetizer and desert, wow! Actually, I would have stayed in my points (after eliminating ALL my flex points! :) except we went to Starbucks later in the evening and I got a strawberry cream Frappucinno (sp?) Little did I know those suckers are  11 points ! Holy cow, it's iced tea from now on (can't stand coffee.) Most of my meals are fewer points than that. However, since I was very agressive with the plan the rest of the week, I still had a good loss.  This week has been a bit more of a struggle. With Maegan and Emily out of town, I'm on my own, and I'm not being very structured. We don't have a lot of "easy" food in the house and after a day of working I hate to cook, as I'm usually starving. So I'm about 12 points in to my flex points already and it's only Thursday. I'm going to try to straighten it out today, but I'm a little worried about the weekend. I'm going to join everyone at my wife's parents, and they tend to cook very good, but not so WW friendly food, as well as eat out a lot. I know it's up to me to control the portions and make healthy choices, but I often find it difficult when I get in this situation to do that. It's a mental thing I need to overcome. We'll see what the scale says on Monday.
