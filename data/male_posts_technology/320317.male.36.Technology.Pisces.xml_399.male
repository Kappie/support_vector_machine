 Once again Macromedia is giving developers what they need to develop Flash content everywhere. I am beginning to think serious about Flash as the only viable cross-platform client-side development environment. I think Microsoft was so scared of Sun and Java that the Flash Player has snuck it's way onto all devices and machines users care about. Reminds me how Apple thought IBM as the enemy, to only find out Microsoft was their real competition (on the client side).
