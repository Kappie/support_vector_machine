We covered this some time ago, and you know how we hate bias on this blog, so today I'm launching  my  new campaign : The Brown Wing Thing   The Brown Wing Thing gives you the option to retain the sanctity of the easy pink, and all those other things that I'm sure they're going on about, whilst still maintaining the option for a bit of romp action.    So, if there's any British girls out their wanting to earn  their  wings, hold your ring aloft with pride!
