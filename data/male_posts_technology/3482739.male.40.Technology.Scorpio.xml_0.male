Went and saw  urlLink Cubensis  last night.   urlLink Hot Buttered Bread  (their website is still under construction) opened for them and appeared to be a pretty smok'en band.  I only saw part of one song because I was talking with Tom R. who's my wife's good friend's husband and the keyboard player for Cubensis.  It is so cool to have a local Grateful Dead tribute/cover band here in LA.  They really help make living here bearable.  The thing about that is that while I was born and raised in the San Fernando Valley, I realized I could be WAY happier without the HELLISH heat of the greater Los Angeles area summers living in  urlLink Edmonds, WA !! ( The City of Edmonds is located in south Snohomish County on the shores of Puget Sound approximately 14 miles north of Seattle. )  We're living in the South Bay (San Pedro/RPV) now because sadly, its only here in LA that Mrs. Beavis can get the respect (and of course the Money) she deserves doing what she does.  Anyway, got up this morning and realized that I hadn't posted since Friday, so I'm like, doing it now.  ;)  Also while blogging, I'm adding the info files from all the shows I've recently downloaded to my info files folder.  I need to publish them (the new ones) on my web page too, but now that its hosted on verizon, its a bit more of a pain then before.  If anyone out there wants to talk about some trades etc., PLEASE feel free to e-mail me!  Oh, just thought... if anyone wants to chat with me, you can typically find me in #SeattleChat on EfNet. ( urlLink www.efnet.net )  Welp, think I'll wrap it up for now.  Gotta eat some breakfast and watch some more Stargate SG-1 Episodes on DVD.  (Showing em all to Mrs. Beavis to get her caught up.)
