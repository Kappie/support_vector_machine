Here's a brief report of my situation now.  Yesterday was damn heavy rain. And it almost rained the whole day. Wasn't a good weather! Today's newspaper reported some trees fell down and some even hit on a car, due to the strong wind.   Today, I have moved my PC from the office to the client office. Not that I've quit my programmer post and work for the client, but it isn't any further than this. We (my senior and I), were told to do the support on the client company until we are ready for the maintenance phase, which is still long to go. But we still insisted to comeback for lunch, coz there is only one canteen and the food is no better than here. But now, I'm in my office without a computer. So, I'm not doing anything but using other computers to surf net (provided the com is not in used). Bad for me. I'm a newbie in programming world. But I don't get much the chance to really write out a program on my own hands. Yet, I'm stuck in the project which I have to stay in the client office. How m I going to learn? What a question.
