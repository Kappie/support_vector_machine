Sinners, casting stones at me  I... I stand, not crawling, not falling down I... I bleed the demons that drag me down I... I stand, (for nothing), not crawling, (the center), not falling down (of calms within the eye) I... I'll bleed, (for no one), The demons, (but myself), that pull me down (for me and no one else)"    this is what i am experiencing in this corporate world right now.   wish me luck.
