Hopefully, this means Gallo will release Ebert from the gypsy curse he put on Ebert that caused him to suffer from some   urlLink Thinner  -esque wasting disease!  Also I think the  urlLink billboard  featuring a blow job, that Gallo has put up in Hollywood, is just wrong.  Although I still kinda want to see the film in spite of its reputation.  Gallo's first directorial effort   urlLink Buffalo '66   was great.
