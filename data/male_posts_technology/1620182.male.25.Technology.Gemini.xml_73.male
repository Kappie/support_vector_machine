I'm going to pose it in several different ways, but they all point to the same underlying point:  What is natural?  What is right, and what is wrong?  What are the fundamental foundations upon which everything is constructed?
 
 Are there fundamental laws that govern everything around us?  Let's assume that there are laws that govern the Universe that cannot be broken.  We'll call them "natural laws."  Physists definitely think there are rules that cannot be broken.  Religious people feel the same way.  So do philosophers, anthropologists, psychologists, biologists, etc.  Problems arise when nobody agrees what these fundamental laws are.  Take Kant for example.  In one article, he posited that human vanity is a major driving force in human history.  Without it, there is no reason to do more than what is necessary to survive, which in turn causes cultural stagnation.  A Christian, on the other hand, would not want to hear this.  To some, vanity is a sin and removing vanity from life is part of improving human culture.  
 
 But can you really overcome vanity?  The philosopher would say no.  The Christian would say yes.  If you can overcome vanity, is it a fundamental and therefore "natural law?" According to our definition, no.  Natural laws are rules that simply cannot be broken.  
 
 What does it mean for something to be natural or unnatural?  In my opinion, something is natural if it is  supposed  to happen.  This lends itself to a discussion on destiny and whether or not events are predetermined.  I don't think that destiny refers to being able to predict the exact state of the Universe at a precise point in time.  Instead, I think that destiny refers to a general orderly procession of events.  The Universe is moving in a certain direction (and I don't mean physically) -- a direction steered by a certain set of fundamental laws.
 
 So if something is natural because it is  destined  to happen, then it follows that unnatural occurances are when you alter the destiny of something.  Is this possible?  This reasoning provides a sort of feed-back loop that can quickly become a confuscating trap of nature versus morality.  
 
 For example, take the issue of stem cell research.  The US government is banned from funding any stem cell research.  Why?  Because President Bush decided that it was "unnatural."  But is it unnatural?  President Bush, being a religious man, might say that a person who loses both their kidneys to disease did so because it was pre-ordained by God.  To find another person who might have a kidney to donate is natural.  To grow another kidney from stem cells would be unnatural, because only God should have the power to create people (or parts thereof).
 
 But if natural laws are impossible to violate, and it is clearly possible to violate this law of creating useful organs, then how can this law be natural?  It's not.  It is immorale (in the eyes of some), not unnatural.  This brings us to an important point.  Morality is a set of artificial laws that  should  be followed, but can be violated.  Therefore, morality is not a set of laws that ultimately govern the Universe (unfortunately).
 
 What if you take a non-religious view on this issue?  What if you think that instead of following the will of God, that the world follows the rule of evolution.  If a person is born with a defective heart, is it okay to give that person a new heart so that he may produce children with defective hearts?  Is it okay that we have medicine so that people with asthma can produce more asthmetic children?  Would the world be a better place if there were no people with heart defects or asthma?  Again, if it were a natural law, it could not be broken.  But are we really breaking the law?  Some might argue that medicine, gene therapy and genetic engineering included, are a natural extension of this law, not an exception.
 
 So why is it so important to discover these fundamental natural laws if they can't be broken?  The reason is that even though you cannot change destiny, you can certainly slow it down.  You can try to keep people from researching stem cells.  You can try to keep gays from marrying.  You can try to dictate your own false and artificial laws to those around you, but you are doing nothing but retarding the development of humankind.  You must understand the laws to understand your destiny.  You must embrace your destiny.  You can help it, but you can't force it.  You can slow it, but you can't fight it. 
 
 So in the governance of man, leaders should follow a certain philosphy.  Look for policies that grease the wheels of destiny.  Avoid those that fight it.  Those who abide by this go down as great leaders.  Those who don't will be remembered for driving their followers into the ground.
