From the review of  urlLink Boyd van Hoeij :  This is not a documentary about 'the whole truth about the Iraq war'.  /.../  the scope of this documentary is small, much smaller that the title might lead you to believe  /.../ So what it is about, then? In fact, this documentary interviews ex-UN inspectors that worked in Iraq, ex-policy makers, people from the army, the CIA and civil service. They speak out about their views on how the Bush administration tried to justify the war in Iraq before it started, and how their justification changed over time during the invasion.  [It] does not rely on a voice-over to spell everything out for the viewer, but rather uses editing as a feature to present a coherent narrative thread made up of small 'sound-bites' from all the interviews conducted with the aforementioned people, interspersed with clips of addresses to the nation, to congress etc of the people of the Bush Administration, illustrating what the interviewees are saying. It is a self-contained whole, though it is not the 'whole truth about the Iraq war' as referred to in the title; that war is still being fought and thus the whole truth is still partly in the making. It concentrates not on combat in Iraq, but rather on the American political arena as a battleground, as an administration seeks justification for a war that was perhaps not really justifiable with the evidence they had.   I must say that I didn't find anything really new in what was presented. It pretty much either was material I already knew or material that was congruent with it. Still, I'd recommend it to those interested in the topic.  As an end note I'd just like to mention the length: it is fairly short, only 56 minutes. -->
