My dad would settle for anything fast, and I have been going to work w/ dad to use my comp there and dl anime.  Engineering camp ended, it wasn't real exciting all we did was learn plumbing and it was not very broad as I expected it to be. Hopefully their are programming classes I can take.  Some basic story is written out for this RPG I promise you that we will release a demo. And if you want to beta test for us, email me.
