Just got back from the IWM which was okay, the bit I liked best was the 'secret war' exhibit about MI5 and MI6, and also the Post 1945 conflicts exhibit, mainly because although i think the wars were terrible tragedies, they don't really interest me all that much, I prefer modern stuff. So yeah, I had an okay day. Now I feel very car sick, and i had forgotten i had so much homeowkr, otherwise i would have done it yesterday and not left it till this evening!! Ooops. Oh well, off to finihs writing baout water boards. What fun.
