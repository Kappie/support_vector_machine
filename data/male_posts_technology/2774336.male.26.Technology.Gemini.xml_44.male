 The Simple White Fish with Lemon recipe in the cookbook is pretty good, although I think that this recipe is a little heavy on the garlic as well.  I thought I may have problems with the first filet of fish, but my stomach settled and I was able to eat another one and a half pieces around 8:50 pm. 

 I wanted to try the Orange Cranberry bread while it was warm, so I'm having a piece now at around 9:30 with a cup of chamomile tea. I'm having a little bloating and belching, but not too bad. 

 Again, I'm happy with the recipes in the book.  The bread is particularly good considering it has no dairy in it at all!  I'm sure I'll have another piece before I turn in for the night. 

 In another act of culinary bravery I decided to pick up a bag of vegetable based mozzarella cheese and was pleasantly surprised at the flavor.  The consistency is a little grainy but simply being able to enjoy that mozzarella flavor again makes it easy to overlook.  The company name is  urlLink Galaxy Nutritional Foods  and the brand name is "Veggie Brand". 

  Update:  I am starting to get some strong gurgling\moving gas feelings in my lower abdomen beneath my belt buckle.  The feeling passes - southwardly - and I'm on my way. After all the fish and bread, I actually almost feel full.  A lot of the feeling is food, but some is bloating.  Still, if I could get my act together earlier in the day I think I might be able to gain some weight back.  The symptoms that I have been having with the food (mainly the belching and bloating that can lead to nausea) is still troublesome to certain activities like exercising. 

  Update:  The moving gas in my intestines has stopped (released) but the bloating in my stomach is turning to nausea.  Perhaps I did eat too much too quickly.  Perhaps there was too much spice or garlic on the fish.  I don't know.  I'll post the time that I'm able to belch enough to end the nausea. 

  Update: The nausea was gone in about a half hour.  The gurgling has continued.
