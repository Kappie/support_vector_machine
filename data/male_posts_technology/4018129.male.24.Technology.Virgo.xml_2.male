By the way, as my english major friend will be quick to point out... compared to the average person around here I fear I may be functionally illiterate. Anyway.. back to reality.  With out further wait... The review of my new home on Brittian Street.  About 20 days ago, the province of New Brunswick sent one of their hired thugs (an rather nice man actually named Mr. Merit) to inform us that because our land lord was a rather large disapointment to humanity and thought that letting 80,000 dollars of ancient electrical repair go unchecked... thus placeing our building now five months out side the realm of the Code of the Building Inspectors.... we needed to find a new place to live.  Well, long story short, after not to much looking, and a whole lot of panicing, we were able to find a new place of residence.  Brittian Street. Located deep south, South End. My warning flags went up. I had visions of needing to start getting the Briggsian Consortium(My friend Steves Goons) to escort me home every eveing. How ever after meeting the upstairs tenents, who I knew, and meeting the land lords them selves (A wonderful couple named Larry and Louanne) I was thirlled.  The place has a strange bit of charm to it. It's older, and there is some work to be done. However it is big, and much nicer by default than some of the other .... slums.... I have lived in. The entrance hall is sizeable. When you enter, the main bed chambers are located on the right. These are three fairly small rooms. This was disheartening. Mostly because only the smallest had a closet and none of them had a overhead light.  Too your left when you enter, you find two large parlours. These large rooms are connected by a set of double doors. Both have overhead lights, however the switches are located in the main hall.  As the large hall way goes on you find yourself at the classy looking bathroom... ok.. by classy.. I mean it dosen't have large gapeing holes in it, nor does it reek of the neighbours pot.  Beyond that section, the hallway opens up in to a modestly sized living room. Now this carpeted area has one major flaw... besides the closet not opening... The floor boards that lead to the kitchen are massively warped to the point of horror movie creepiness.  As said this room leads in to the Kitchen/Dineing room which is spacious... but could only seem that way considering the complete lack of major surfaces. There are no... may I state again.. NO cupboards. But we have a really nice pantry.  Beyond the kitchen a screen door leads the adventureous in to our laundry room. And another set of doors takes you to our small excuse for a back yard. Did I mention we also have a coveted South End Front Yard (Aka.. patch of partly growing green vegitation?)  Now with Steve and I chooseing to risk life and limb and take the conjoining parlors as bedrooms. And Kelly taking too smaller ones as a room/study. We've begun to settle in.  Larry and Louanne are hardworking good and honest people. And they really care about people and thier property.  The cozyness factor is also something I admire.. and did I mention the sazzy mouldings everywhere... I do swoon over such old mouldings!  On a Reality Buster Scale of 0-10... I would Rank this place as an initial 8. Which is what I would rank possibly the nicest home I ever lived in.... 90 Queen Street.  What this Brittian street home lacks in the "Pretty Factor" it makes up for in character and awesome Landlords. 90 Queen was great... and I liked the landlords.. but it was pulling teeth to get any work done.  Anyway.. so.. 8/10... GO BRITTIAN STREET... YOU CAN DO IT LIL' GUY!  ...  I'm out.  -Josh
