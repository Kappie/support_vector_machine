Now I know how many kids she has, her age, what her father does (a bug spray man), where he is from (AL) and something about the Cumberland gap.  I commented on the rings on her red painted toes.  I will keep getting more info from her to get a complete profile.  The nerds are trippen again.    urlLink www.neurosonics.com/tech/bgm-kurzweil.html   Talk is already underway on how to link minds to popup adds... I need some exploded corn kernels...
