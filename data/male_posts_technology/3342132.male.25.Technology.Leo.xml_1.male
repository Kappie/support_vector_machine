The Patent system has been much maligned for issuing patents that are neither novel nor practical.   The patenting blunders are especially visible in the software industry as the capacity to innovate (or term something as innovation) are very very high. The USPTO may not be equipped to handle this overwhelming number of patent requests.   As Sir Tim Berners Lee (Inventor of the WWW) clearly states in this  urlLink article ,  "It's really important that they put tremendous restrictions on or complete abolition of software patents"  . If Sir Tim Berners Lee had decided to patent his idea in 1989, the growth of the www would have been stunted and we may never have had an unifying internet! Scary thought that.  Take a look at these recent patents of  urlLink Microsoft  and  urlLink IBM . If two of the biggest names in the personal and enterprise computing industry go about patenting such triviality. Then, you never know what's gonna happen as the days go by.   Another such blimey by the USPTO is possibly the infamous Amazon   " urlLink one-click"    patent. Although there was no pre-existing patent or paper, it gave amazon.com exclusive rights to a practice that was widely used in the software industry at that time.  According to the Scientific American article, two economists Adam Jaffe of Brandeis University and Josh Lerner of Harvard Business School are coming up with a book   urlLink Innovation And Its Discontents: How Our Broken Patent System Is Endangering Innovation and Progress, and What to Do About It    that brings out the shortcomings of the existing system and suggests ideas for revamping it.   Their suggestions in brief that I picked from the article are,  * Most patents considered "economically unimportant" would get only a cursory examination as they wouldn't raise many objections. Excepting those cases would let examiners spend more time on the critical cases. * After the examiner decides that a patent can be issued, a "pre-grant opposition" process would begin that allowed others to point to "prior art" indicating that the patent is not innovative or inventive. * Even if a prior art cannot be found and patent is granted, it may still not meet the requisite obviousness standard e.g. the amazon "one-click" patent. So, a review and re-examination procedure needs to be in place to avoid such blunders. * Even after all these, bad patents would still be granted. The authors suggest that judges, not juries rule in these cases, increasing likelihood that plaintiffs would get a fair hearing.  These may not be the best solution on offer and everyone may not be in agreement with them. But, what everyone agrees is that the patent system needs to be revamped. Otherwise, there may arise extreme situations like in the netherlands, where the patenting system was abolished between 1869 and 1910 because it was issuing patents for everything. Most open source advocates would definitely love that when it comes to software patents :-)
