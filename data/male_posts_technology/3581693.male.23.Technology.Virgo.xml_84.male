These thoughts and many more pass through my head as I sit in my dark room - doors closed - curtains drawn - at my computer. As I sit here with a tummy full of food - I look for inspiration. I want to follow my friend Amn's lead ( urlLink Kwyjibo Classic ) - and compose a blog so spectacular, so amusing, so thought provoking... but alas, such a blog can only be developed over a great length of time. Time which I will use to study the art of blogging. Screw the sunshine - I need to blog. I need to eat, sleep and breath boob... I mean blog. Come with me friends as I embark on a fantastic journey of a young and still somewhat impressionable mind. This is the start of something special, something new, something so totally Shaundiggity.
