Ok, fine, I'm not in rehab, and when I say sponsor I mean monkey, and maybe I had a little  urlLink help  with the slogans, but still.  It's the thought that counts, isn't it?   Isn't it?   At least that's what my parents told me every Christmas when they gave me rubber bands and boxes of Shake 'n Bake (pre-Cat Shake 'n Bake Incident) as gifts.  But enough about me.    1.  Please Don't Squeeze The  Boz .   2.  The Best Part Of Waking Up Is  Marci  In Your Cup. 3.  I Liked The  Zann  So Much, I Bought The Company! 4.  Break Me Off a Piece of That  Dvl .   5.  Crunch All You Want. We'll Make  Mike . 6.  There's No Wrong Way to Eat a  Bored Housewife . 7.  This Is Not Your Father's  Sandra . 8.  Strong Enough for a Man, Made for a  Jonnie . 9.   Madmathias . It's Everywhere You Wanna Be. 10. The  AtlSuperstar  That Eats Like A Meal.   And in conclusion, I would like to say there is no conclusion, except I think my eyes are bleeding and if I never see another slogan again it will be too soon.
