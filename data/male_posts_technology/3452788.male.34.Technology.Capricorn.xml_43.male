Well, that was done between the accounting office and the tank fund reimbursement office here.  After moving computers around and installing new wiring, a big file cabinet prevented removal of an unused network cable.  Eventually, someone asked my why they could not access the server.  Always check the dummy stuff first - all cables have 2 ends!  Sure enough, she was "networked" to a 1960's-era metal file cabinet.
