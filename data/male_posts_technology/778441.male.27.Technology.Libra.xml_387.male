The premiere would be preceeded by a parade by the cast and crew of the epic trilogy directed by the diminutive Peter Jackson.  Fans crowded the venue of the parade, twenty four hours before it was due to even start. They were  urlLink rewarded for their patience  when at midnight, stars from the film went around, chatting with them and signing autographs.  New Zealand Herald has a  urlLink running commentary of the parade , updated every few minutes with tidbits about the stars and their soundbites.  Webcams placed strategically along the route of the parade are  urlLink webcasting the event  live.  The LoTR fever is at its height!! And I can't wait for the film to be released for the public.
