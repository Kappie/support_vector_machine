Although I keep reading all the blogs daily, I really don't know, what to talk about today....So many issues, going around, i guess.....I might have to sit down  read them all, one more time, before i can post my views.....I hope i'll do that....  Had a chat with Kicha last week,  so I remember this one isuue very well....posted by Kicha.....Female Identity  words like "for men, their work is the life's purpose.. while for the women servicing their hubby is the life's purpose..."  Horoscope.....  About the saying above, I don't think 'servicing' is a right word there......Sure i'll always put my family first, not my career...I do  that because I love my husband  in the future I want my kids to get the best care.....  My opinion on this would be, I do agree with the point that, Family is very very important for a woman....But it does not take her entire time  brains to do that..... Though life might be quiet busy, turning back after years, we might get the eternal satisfaction that i've satisfied both my family  me.....   about the horoscopes....I'm really confused myself.....Why is the divorce rate so low in arranged marriages? Horoscope is a science, It's not a myth.....i know just that much.....Maybe, I too need more inputs on this issue.....Would like to hear from you guys.....  Ok time for my class.....going now.... bye
