It was really cool for us lot to have a chill out night for a change instead of the usual antic of alcohol abuse! First impressions of the flat were very impressive, and after an inspection of every alcove and corner I have decided to give it rating of 4.5 out of 5 (only lacking .5 due to Toaster not having a bar...yet!). So after consuming wine and beer we all decided to play Trivial Pursuit, yes that game where you need a diploma in almost everything to qualify as a contestant, and it didn't help that we used the genius edition!!!  Anyway, so we then decided that this game should be boys V girls (big mistake!). And so we started...... Suffice to say that by the time us boys had picked up our first piece of blue pie, the girls had got all their pieces, finished the game and generally laughed at us! (But our time was to come.....oh yes...)  Following THAT game everyone continued to consume wine at a fair pace and we then decided to play Pictionary- A great game, and one which I excel at! So we all paired up with each other, pulling names out of a hat to do so and we were ready to commence the battle!...  Now I'm not going to go into too much detail of each teams tactics but.....what the fuck, here they are:  Baity  Dougle- Our tactic was simple..we were going to win!  Damo  Jo- To get off to a good start...and then leaden and sag like a grannies tits!  Kate  Debs - To employ all their cunning and ability to CHEAT as much as possible!!! (Not that it did them any good)  And lastly Toaster  Kirk- Their plan was simple, that they wouldn't even leave the starting square until the last turn hehe!  Now the outcome of this game wasn't really a surprise...Myself and Doulge reigned supreme YAY!!! Also I must point out that in a desperate attempt to get off the starting space, Toaster, who was drawing at the time, actually wrote the answer instead of drawing a picture, only for him and Kirk to still lose the round as Dougle's expert speed drawing allowed us to fuck them over! See, cheats never prosper.  The last installment of fun for the night, other than drinking, was me giving Toaster some advice on some shrubs to go on his patio, but I shall spare everyone the details. All in all a great night and one that we will hopefully do again, nice one Big T.  Baity signing off.....
