The script is very basic and can be easily modified.  I modified the script to include the required libraries within the script itself.  I also added a readme file and made the script a little more professional looking.  Version 1.1 is available here:  urlLink http://www.treyhunner.com/simple-rss-aggregator-1.1.tar.gz
