But what you may not know is the long stretch of virtually fatal corridor through which people travel everyday to reach there... I’m talking about the NH – Hosur Road stretch, that connects the "Electronics city" which houses a large number of corporates with the mainland and is fast becoming a leading contender for "the most fatal road" award.. especially for people traveling in 2-wheelers... let alone pedestrians. Three infoscions have met with fatal accidents in that road over the past 1 month. And god knows how many more of other friends... Despite hues by corporate heads including Azim Premji, the Govt responded with hardly a benign reply... It seems to be every man for himself on that NH...  As a step to stem this rising menace, we at Infosys have launched a scheme. We call it the  Car Pooling ... The number of employees commuting in cars is much of a 3-digit figure with almost as many number of cars.  Car Pooling  is all about every willing person who has some seats vacant when he drives out, announcing that he has N vacant seats to accommodate that many people... and he goes to place X via place Y at time T... and interested persons can contact him directly and join him to their destination and reach safely to their home.   A tyical post would be...   Subject:   3 seats available To: Koramangala 3rd Block, Raheja Residency - via: Silk Board, Fern Hills, IGate Contact Person - Sriram (extn. 59121 /  mob. 98451-81367) My Car - Light Green Santro Xing, KA-01-A-1672 Location - Parked between Building 20 and 23. Leaving around 8 PM.   This "announcing" is enabled by having a new folder specifically for  Car Pooling  in the Bulletin board, where willing persons can post their willingness or people who want a ride can post their requirements...  Now, what does this solve...  1. The number of people taking to 2-wheelers can be reduced this way by optimum use of available vacant seats in cars and thereby reducing traffic risks in the NH. 2. Reduces the internal traffic within the Infosys campus by reducing the number of 2 wheelers getting parked and moved around. 3. Enables people traveling to places not well connected by buses. 4. Facilitates people who may have to travel at an "untimely" time.  Today is the first day of its launch and the folder is already brimming with activity... People posting their willingness to take others and also others posting their needs of a ride to some place... There is also an initiative to launch an application in the intranet that will channelise and better organize this entire procedure.   Hope, friends in other corporates around this place too start to follow some such means.
