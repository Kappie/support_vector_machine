She has played several concerts and has actually put out a music CD that sold pretty well at the local Borders.   It's been a long while since we last talked, especially about one of our favorite subjects: filmmaking. Last time we talked, me mentioned making a short film for the San Juan Cinemafest. This festival usually takes place between September and November.   We talked a lot about this and we will be getting together during the week to continue planning and make contact with several of our filmmaking friends to help us with the project.  I have always taught that independent filmmakers should pull together, given that we all have the same goals, even taught we often differ in the way we want to go about and reach those goals. Different points of view often pulls people away from each other, instead of bringing them closer. Also, there is this big wall called ego that often makes collaboration impossible.  Yesterday was very positive and I hope it will open the door to a good collaboration that will bear fruit. I will keep you posted on this. Wish us luck !!!   urlLink Sailor Ecchi
