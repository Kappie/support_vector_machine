I DO in fact enjoy RPG, have played it since I was siz, just like computer games. To avoid the sad computer geek/RPG picture you now have of me, I have also been travelling to a few very exciting countries and I love various forms of art, especially the impressionist style of painting. A good hour of Qincy Jones and other jazz would also do just fine.  I'll post more later.  Svenni
