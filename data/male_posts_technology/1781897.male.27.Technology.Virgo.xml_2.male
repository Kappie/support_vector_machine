Me n my main squeeze were tryin to get the eagle to land as it has many times in the past without incident.....this time, was different.  Usually, the eagle lands with the timing and smooth style of an 35 year old whop walking into a cheerleading camp, but this time our eagle had....well, it had its wings clipped, and what follows are the trials and perils of getting the eagle to land in the land of the wicked.   5:15: The escape  With the eagle on my mind (as it has been for a couple of days) I slip out of work like a ninja in the dark....my destination.....the bravo extraction point...my mission....to attain the eagle.   5:45 The Dirt Bike Kid  So, with my mind contently resting on the eagle, I proceed with my mission...heading due north...making good time (on the motorcycle so traffic couldn't stop this ninja) when the Dirk Bike Kid enters.  There was an eruption of sound and vibration coming from my pocket (no, I wasn't getting horney) that failed to stop.  I pulled over I was so distracted....to my surprise, it was the dirt bike kid going fucken crazy bout how I had to call him STAT.....this doesn't bode well as I am on a mission of the ut most importance......   5:47 Indecent proposal  After a bit of fumbling around, I was able to get to the bottom of the Dirt Bike Kid's agenda.....he needed a helping hand in moving some shit out of his girlfriend's house.  As you can imagine, this goes against every fiber of my mission, and even more fucked up, its the last damn thing on earth I felt like doing....but, being the push over that I am, I opted to help my homie in need....I figure....what goes around comes around...if I help this guy...the eagle is sure to land!   7:00 The bullshit has gone on long enough  Upon completing of the deed (moving big shit from girls house to second story storage level unit.  Argh!), the gory details of which I will spare you, I had a dry mouth, a headache, and no eagle in sight.   7:45 The realization  Realizing that we may have to spend our labor day weekend in an eagle vacuum, panic set in.  My mind wanders to the possibility that I may need to circumvent normal eagle protocol, and try something "outside the box" to fix this bind!  Allz I can say is, thank God for the quick thinking mind of a little lovely named Don Hollironi...The don pool resources...phone callz were made.....and shit was happening.....we were on the trail of an eagle landing....fucken finally!!!   9:30 We gotta go where?  So, our new eagle landing required some re-allocation of manpower...to make this happen, one ninja had to do some flying, magic babysitting whilst ninja #2 took the mole to the landing strip, which was ass far, and took all kindz of time....   10:30 Back to base  After all the bullshit...all the hoops....the eagle had finally landed.....allz I can say is....fucken A.  So that's my story......long...drawn....but true....and man...it was worth it!
