I did not approve of something she did and I am certain that she cannot deny it either. Things between us may not be as rosy as they were earlier but that is not going to let me sit back and see her hurt herself all over again. She deserves the best in life. I only pray that she does not put herself throught those painful experiences once again. And, if I did react it was because I care for her and nothing else. The rest of it was the usual routine of work out and cooking. Sandeep confirmed that he would be visiting me at the end of this month. That definitely sounds like a lot of fun. So, that was my day for you.
