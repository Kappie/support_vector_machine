The first song i heard was this song by Lena ( i think she sang the god-awful ah beng anthem Barbie Girl) , and the song went something like "It's your duty...to shake your booty." Yup this is the crap they are playing nowdays, and that also reminds me of the other totally dumbass song by Nelly where he advises his poor female friends that "it's getting hot in here, so take off all your clothes". Probably so that they don't get dehydrated. Nice fellow.   Then a couple of videos later is Limp Biskit's new video. Yeah unfortunately one of the worst bands I ever heard are back with their new album.  I seriously don't know how people can actually listen to something this awful, all their songs sound almost exactly the same, and Durst basically just keeps complaining about how everyone is against him yada yada.  When you are a freaking millionaire who gets to hang out at the Playboy mansion, you don't get to complain.
