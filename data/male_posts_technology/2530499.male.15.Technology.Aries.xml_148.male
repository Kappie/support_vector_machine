Tears me up inside to see how other asshole jerks treat some chicks...they're the sweetest girls, would do anything for their boyfriends, but the boyfriends use them as status symbols and don't always care...  WHEN will I be able to show the world (and this girl!) how to respectfully respect and treat ladies, the oh-so-awesome part of the world? (Yes. I am aware that I used world twice in the sentence.)  To the following people: Kelly-Will set up KelBox soon. Blake-We will hang out soon. ROZ-Get sleep. JQ-Return from whence you came! TJZ-Put on your shorts! BYB-Call me. We'll subway sometime. CH-Uh...we need to do that "hang out" thing that teenagers today do. KNT-Before you move, when will WE chillz0rz 0uT? KTM-Rhymes with ATM. Mugs? NKP-Encrypt!  I left people out, but at this hour, I could care less. I was working on my goddamn network for two hours, trying to balance it...finally...balanced.  Anyways, props/shout-outs/mad love: Kelly, you rock. ROZ, thank you. A lot. JQ, let's move and Mugs. Blake, let's go somewhere! Dylan, let's get you a PC!  Goodbye for now... I don't wanna leave. Fuck it! Bye.  [Music:] AT Jingle...  Current Clipboard Contents: (22:49:28) Requesting key...
