All in all at least it was a positive day although I'm giving away a lot on UB.  I played a large MTT tourney there last night and probably should have hung in until the money since they were paying 150 and I broke out at 184, but I was really playing for the win and I needed to make a stand before the blinds started eating me up and caught a bad break.  I played very well in the tourney though.  Maybe as aggressive as ever and just making sure all my good starting hands either paid well or didn't get sucked out by making sure people paid to draw against them.  I may try to play a little more limit tomorrow on all the sites and see if it isn't a bit more profitable than the SnG's.  Overall, I like the SnG's because I limit my losses, but if I'm not catching the cards, as has been proven of late, I can still end up posting losses for the day and I just can't accept that.  The other thing is that I think I may have to vary my game selection a bit more as sometimes I catch myself feeling like I'm just going through the motions and that just doesn't have a very positive expectation.  Enough for now.  Until next time.....
