It is certainly a weight off my shoulders, what with all the issues I've been having there of late.  On July 5 I start my new job at Roger's part time, and I'm kind of excited about it.  It's been many many years since I was in a direct B2B type of sales role, and I welcome the challenge.  I don't know that this is my career bliss, but I also don't know that it isn't.  So we'll see.  I'll take a couple of months and explore it, see how I dig it and if I can make any scratch doing it.  One thing that kind of shook me yesterday when I went in to do all the paperwork is that two of the people who worked at a previous gig I had are there.  Tina and Bruce I worked with both at the furniture place, and they're ok people I guess.  I was just surprised to see Tina there yesterday in charge of all the commissions and paperwork stuffs.  She says the professionalism of this company is miles beyond the last one we worked together at, so that's a good thing.  Now just to kick some ass and make some headway so I can completely quit my sucky retail job.  That would be a very much good thing.  I have never worked in a purely commission environment before, so this will be a gas to see how much I make when I write my own paycheques.  The only concern is where my head is at these days, and if I can bring it on or not.  The idea of working with Bruce and Tina again makes me think of how everything tends to be circular.  For 7 or 8 years I've been going in various circles; working at a place, moving up, moving up, moving on, turning around and going back in an entry level position.  And here I am again in another circle, although a smaller one.  I worked with those two people 18 months ago, left, did a little loop-dee-loop and here we are again.  Hopefully it will work out better than it did last time.  Alls I know for sure about the future is that leaving fido has lifted a bit of a weight off, and I feel somewhat free.  Perhaps I've put a new weight back on, but perhaps not.  We shall see.
