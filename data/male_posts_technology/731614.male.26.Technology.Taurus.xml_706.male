Sorry.  As penance I will now give you a quotation, at random, from Thackeray's "Vanity Fair" which has nothing whatsoever to do with Melville, but they are making a movie of it (with Reese Witherspoon) so maybe this will whet your chops.  ". ..was perverted at the Cocoa-Tree, made helplessly tipsy by this abominable suitor and perverter of youth, and fleeced of four thousand pounds."  Ah Bartleby, ah humanity!
