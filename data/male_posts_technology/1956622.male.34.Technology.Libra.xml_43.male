When I told her I was at work she thought it was funny that I worked during her night night time.  I would like to point out that I called at 18:50 my time and was told to call back in 15 minutes by   SFW   which is after 20:00 at night in Michigan.  The only reason I point this out is because at 20:05 I called and got Jon   (Fuck Stick) from now on referred to as FS   on the phone.  I asked for Karissa and got   SFW   who then gave me Karissa.    So that just adds to the case that she is in contempt!  Other then that nothing special to say today.  My mother received a call for me today from Microsoft Personnel however, the called did not leave a name or a number and when I called Microsoft Corporate main line they cannot connect me to a person unless I have a name or e-mail address so needless to say I am in a quandry.  I am still trying to find someone there at Microsoft who can help but....  I would not be interested in going back to Seattle but for the right price and the right job in Seattle I would probably go.
