In fact most of the time they are perfectly rational. and I don't think this is limited to females. Men can be just as crazy sometimes too. Like in this past week's episode of "enterprise", when the only rational person on the planet after the pollen got stirred up, was a girl. I mean given, she was a vulcan, but the men were just totally crazy.  Like Cahlen said, "you would not believe how little it takes for a persons mind to snap" or something along those lines:)  Well, that's pretty much it. I can't get on MSN today:(
