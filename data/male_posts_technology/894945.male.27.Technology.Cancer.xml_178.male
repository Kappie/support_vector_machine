I was on my bed in a rodeo position, screaming "Yeeee-haaaaaaaaaa!"   Can you imagine something REALLY bad actually happening over here.. some kind of industrial gas leak or King Kong, running up and down King Street knocking over the blue-rinse brigade? The JEP would have a fit and come in a hard back edition!
