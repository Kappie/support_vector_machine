We cleaned cars to raise money for our trip to Brazil in 2004. Sarah, Sophie, Law, Christable, Helen, Andy, Owen, Matt and myself. Neil didn't turn up, well he did at the begining for his meeting and then went home. We cleaned lots of cars and got very wet and cold, but it was good fun and it will be worth it in the end.  According to researchers, people bring good fortune on themselves by following four basic rules: maximising opportunity; acting on intuition; anticipating good fortune; and taking an optimistic long view of life.  Ha.
