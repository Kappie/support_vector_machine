I am happy to have you post your comments on my blog but I do ask you to be honorable enough to add your name at the end of your post. Comments made without a name are uncredible and have no meaning. Besides, while you have the right to dissent and post your opinion (As I do), I have a right to know who leaves a comment.  Now, about this Blog... This is my blog. If you don't like it, don't read it. If you disagree with me. Fine. Say so but do it with Honor and respect. Leave your name.  Posts that I make to this Blog when under the news heading will be factual. That means I have done everything I can to verify the validity of what I am telling you. If something is my opinion, it will be prefaced that it is my opinion. As you are, I am entitled to my opinion as well. If you don't like it, don't read my Blog or say so, just leave your name.  Now, on with the news. On Wednesday of last week, Council passed the second reading of the sign ordinance. Looks like the books closed on this one. Maybe now we can move on to more important stuff.  Council also balked (Except for Mrs. Holder) on my proposal to ask the voters to amend the Charter in order to allow advisory votes. It always happens at least once a year that someone on Council say we should ask the voters... Only problem is we can't. Unless we change the charter.  Arguments made against this proposal by my fellow Council Members included that, and I quote, "I am better equipped to make the hard decisions than the voters". "If I want the voters opinion I will do a scientific Poll". "The voters put us here to make the tough decisions".  My argument for is that we are here as Council People to express your views. Sometimes it is hard to gauge the views of the entire district or the entire city for that matter. When it is a tough issue, why shouldn't we have the ability to go to the people?  In my opinion, some people get power hungry when they get on the Council and the only way to keep their power is to take it away from the people. I couldn't believe that one of my colleagues actually said that they were better equipped to make the decision than the voters. I couldn't believe it.  Now I understand that in some cases a vulnerability Council may abuse the advisory ballot issue, but then it should be shame on them. You don't hurt an entire community because you are worried about what a Council might do ten years from now.  And of course we had that terrible exciting budget presentation. What's new? Not much besides four new fire department positions. I guess we are not going to police the subdivisions anymore as our Mayor just doesn't seem to care about your personal safety. Again, no positions for police.  Anyway... Some comment leavers seem to think I am somehow tied in with L. Brooks and the Republicans. Sorry, I am a moderate democrat. I just think his war with the Religious Right is funny! I always thought the County Democratic Party was messed up, but the County Republicans can't even get along. It's hilarious.  Anyway, the point I was trying to make was that in my opinion, L. Brooks is right. With the Democratic party so messed up, now is the opportune time for the Republicans to be going after disgruntled Dems. Unfortunately, L. Brooks and his band can't get along with the neoconservative religious right faction of the party and there is a growing number of people (Myself included) that don't want to have anything to do with either party at the moment.  Peace.
