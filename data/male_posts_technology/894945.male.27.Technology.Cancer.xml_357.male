I have the upmost respect for all the women out there, and I try my upmost not to piss them off with my posts (not that I post nasty things about them anyway). Basically your point is very true.....'If you don't like what you read, especially if you have had an encounter with one of the lads, then don't read the site!'  Now to show that we at the Toaster Files aren't nasty bitter people towards our critics I have attached a picture of Custards assailant to prove that we jest not!!!
