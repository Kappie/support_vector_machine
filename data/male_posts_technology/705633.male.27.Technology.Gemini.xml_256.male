She has been crying this afternoon due to the workload given to her before she leaves at the end of this month. Not something I would wish upon anyone, but my personal feelings towards her are completely separate to my feelings on her ability to do her job. SHE CANT!!! My five years to her six months of experience should suggest that maybe, just maybe I might be able to suggest something helpful? But alas, to be ignored and returned to the pale of insignificance is frustrating to say the least. Ohh how I look onto the time when she leaves and I am left to do the work left behind…  Today is also Think Pink day for breast cancer. As a fund raising event, everyone in work had to wear something pink. So far I have seen multiple blouses and shirts, one bra and two pairs of thongs.  Brilliant day.  The highlight was walking through town.  You see, I not really an exhibitionist by heart… but I had two choices of pink for today. Either the 1920's style pink dress I have from Custards Gangsters and Molls fancy dress party, when I went as a Moll.  Or I had the size 14, custom made to fit, Pink Fluffy Bunny Rabbit slippers. I went for the slippers and everyone that I passed (and even some cars) looked, smiled, and once I passed, laughed out loud. Makes me feel warm inside…  *On a scale of one to spoil the ending of Sixth sense
