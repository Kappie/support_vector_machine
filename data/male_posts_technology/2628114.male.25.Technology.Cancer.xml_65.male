I made it just over a mile on a gorgeous Wednesday morning only to be turned around by some "complications" that only runners will understand.  It was frustrating to have to walk back but at least it wasn't boring.  I'm still amazed at the amount of people on the streets at that time.  More importantly, I never cease to be amazed at who is on the streets at that time.  Wednesday I saw a 6 or 7 year old girl just wandering down the street just before 7a.m.  I am sure school is out so it left a variety of questions in my head that I won't take the time to list here.    Thursday's run was an almost identical run to a run I did with Brad a few weeks back.  I was sleep-deprived and had just loaded up on a 4 course meal that included steak and potatoes.  Against much of my better judgment, I set out about an hour after dinner right as darkness was settling in.  I completed 4 miles down Madison and a little ways past the Running Spot.  I could not shake a pukey feeling throughout the run, as you could probably imagine trying to run with that much stuff in your stomach.  I fought cramps through the first 3 miles and by the 4th mile, my body was ready to quit due to exhaustion.  I didn't feel nearly as bad last night as I did with Brad two weeks ago, but after large meal runs are increasingly becoming my least favorite of all runs.  My knees only escalated to an annoying ache when I was powering up hills.  Other than that, besides the exhaustion and pukey feeling, I felt great.  I crashed quickly upon arriving home too which was wonderful.  I am resting today and gearing up for an 8-miler on Saturday.  Look for more updates then!  For a final thought today, something that has been going through my head for the past 3 days. We were meant to live for so much more.  Have we lost ourselves?  Somewhere we live inside.  Have a great weekend!
