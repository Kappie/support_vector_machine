Feel free to copy and do your own, but leave a link in the comments.   When it rains, I:	sit by the window, watching and listening, or go driving, or take a walk When it's sunny, I:	pull the curtains and hide from the light When it's windy, I:	get bad allergies, then headaches When it's snowy, I:	am amazed at the playful snowflakes, and awed by the beauty of  perfect, untouched snow on the ground When it's stormy, I:	want it to continue for days, and go watch the ocean crashing on the rocks When it’s foggy, I:	want to be surrounded by it, and am glad that it makes everyone else irritable When I'm happy, I:	try to accept it, even though it makes me uncomfortable When I'm sad, I:	am not surprised, have no hope, have no energy, have nothing to say When I'm scared, I:	feel defeated and want to hide When I'm lonely, I:	want company, but cannot bring myself to reach out to others, so I bear the loneliness as if it were something to be proud of When I'm horny, I:	stay behind my desk so I don’t distract my co-workers. When I'm in love, I:	feel happy to be loved, but scared it might tragically end When I'm angry, I:	destroy stuff, hurt feelings, feel guilty later When I'm hating, I:	get real quiet, bottle up the anger, then blow up and lash out at everyone else within sight When I'm hurting, I:	feel wounded and raw and bleeding, and want to (1) hide to either die or recover, or (2) hold on to someone who loves me When I'm thinking, I:	am at my best When I'm sleeping, I:	am sound asleep, unless an earthquake happens When I'm cold, I:	love to bundle up in layers of clothes and blankets When I'm hot, I:	look for shade, or rest in a cool place When it's night, I:	walk or drive around, wondering about the stories behind each window When it's day, I:	work, or feel guilty about not working When it's morning, I:	wish I could sleep another 4 hours When it's evening, I:	am exhausted from having to play nice all day When it's summer, I:	wish it was winter When it's autumn, I:	like to see everything dying and preparing for a long winter nap When it's winter, I:	wish there was less rain and fog here, and more snow and ice When it's spring, I:	enjoy the last few days until the allergies get real bad When I'm drunk, I:	get even more introspective and quiet than normal (then just fall asleep) When I'm stoned, I:	sorry, no drugs, my body is a temple (just shitloads of junk food) When I win, I:	win with class, and feel like I deserved it  When I lose, I:	lose with dignity, feel like I deserved it, and get mad enough to try again. When I look in the mirror, I:	try not to dwell on the imperfections When I watch TV, I:	like sports, nature, science, and old 70’s-80’s game shows When I watch movies, I:	like to escape reality, try not to be critical of poor performances, and remember that Matt Damon is much better than Ben Affleck When I listen to music, I:	like to lose myself in the moment, feel the chords and the rhythm as if I were playing myself. When I watch baseball, I:	miss not having a Dad to play ball with, and wish I could have seen the old players from the 30’s through the 50’s. When I read, I:	learn something new every time I pick up a book When I'm tired, I:	want to sleep like a polar bear When I'm wide awake, I:	have to be thinking or occupying my brain with some mental task When I'm fighting, I:	know I am right, even if I question myself later When I'm arguing, I:	don’t understand how the other person can’t see that I am right When I'm feeling clever, I:	have just repaired something or written something I am proud of When I'm feeling stupid, I:	have just finished another day at the office, or just been talking to my daughter When I’m writing, I:	have a lot to say, some boring, some stupid, some insightful and witty, all of it serious and heavy, and mean every word of it When I sing, I:	sing the harmony parts, instrumental parts, bass line, or the drums, but usually not the melody When I dance, I:	look like an idiot, hence the dance moratorium of 1989 When I drink, I:	love a huge cup with a mixture of diet coke, mr pibb, cherry coke, and dr pepper, but only from the fountain, no cans or bottles When I eat, I:	eat too much, enjoy myself, think of my Mom When I look back, I:	wish I had not been scared to be myself all the time, and wish I treated a few people with a little more respect and kindness. When the world ends, I:	won’t be here to care
