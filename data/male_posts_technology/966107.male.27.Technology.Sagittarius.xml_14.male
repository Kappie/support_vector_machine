I am talking about the signs that you put on your doors / gates like: "Beware of Dog" or "Salesmen not allowed". But my belief was shattered day before yesterday when I saw a sign on a house in J. P. Nagar in Bangalore which said: "Beware of Coconuts". Coconuts??? How much more weird can this world get?
