That'll be the problem with my weight, all this free pop:) After winning 2 games of racquetball last night, I'm feeling great.  Once, there was a guy with a bucket on his head, He'd walk around and walk into everything, and then one day he got a car and drove around with a bucket on his head. The end  (I've always had problems ending stories:)  Time to play video games
