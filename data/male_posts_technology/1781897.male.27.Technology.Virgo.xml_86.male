Dood, that place is wonderful, but I feel like the place is about 15 years behind the civil engineering learning curve.  The roads there are not near large or elaborate enough to accommodate all of the traffic.  I spent the last 4 days with veins popping out of my forehead, and terrible things coming out of my mouth.  NOBODY there drives with ANY urgency.  Cant tell you how many times I've pleaded with people to GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!!!!!!!  It will be a while before I can endure such incompetence behind the wheel!   drunk...  When in Rome, do what the Romans do.  I was drunk from about 1 hour after landing until Monday morning....around 11:00 AM.  I suspect that this hang over will persist until i leave friday for a bachelor party in Chicago.  Anyone have a liver they can loan me?  Mine's almost out!!!   junk in the trunk...  My lil bro Kevin is the man.  This kid should be on the fucken bomb squad...that's all i can say about this line item.  He is the master of disarming disaster!   a bank robber...  In an effort to expand my ever growing army of tattoos, I had planned to get one while in Colorado from a place where my little brothers go to get theirs.  We scope the place out, and I'm all stoked to go on Saturday morning to get inked...until i read the paper!  The asshole who gives the great tattoos decided to rob the bank (the one in the parking lot next to the parlor) and gets caught because intelligence is not what hez good at.  This foolz girl friend works at the bank, and he robbed it by going to the drive up and asking for all the money.  Little did he know that they could see him, and since they all see each other every fucken day, he was recognized and caught.  The tattoo parlor seems to be closed, and needless to say, i didn't get my ink.  Lame.  So there it is kids...yet another epic adventure.  There are, of course, details that i could never give you because i'm under N.D.A. but believe me when I say this...it was one unforgettable trip.  All of this happened around the main event which was a wedding of 2 good friends of mine.....they went through with it.
