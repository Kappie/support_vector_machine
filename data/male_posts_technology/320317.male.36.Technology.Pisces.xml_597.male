Most simply rearrange, reformat, and regurgitate the same information included in the manufacturer's documentation. What good is that? The whole point of buying an additional book is to benefit from the insights of an independent, unbiased expert."

 

 I don't know how many times I have bought a computer book, and have read maybe one or two chapters, and then never pick it up again. It's not because I am not interested in that topic. It's just a lot easier to reference Google to find examples of what I am looking for at the time. From a reference point of few, I think  computer books are obsolete , but books that are more "strategy oriented", and offer examples of real world tasks, I would be willing to purchase. Most computer books try to teach you syntax. Although this is important, I don't care about that at first. I have a certain type of functionality I am trying to get to work, help me do that first. I'll figure out the syntax as I go. A good example of a book I actually used is the recent Wrox book  urlLink Professional ASP.NET Web Forms Techniques , which is less about code and syntax, and more about good techniques with real world examples.
