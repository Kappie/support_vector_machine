I was hurting Friday morning as well as feeling shitty for something that was said the previous night.  eh.. fast forward.  Went back home and packed some shit to take to Iowa and off we go.  The drive was fast.  I got to Sam's in about 4 hours.  That's pretty good considering it was about 320 miles, I was averaging around 80 the whole way.  ======== I don't condone speeding.  with that said, there are two type of speeding, wreckless and safe.  Let me go of on a tangent real quick here.  Wreckless speeding involves the weaving in and out of traffic.  The safe speeding is the going fast on long straightaways and when there usually isn't anyone around.  Granted both of these are still breaking the law, it's still safer to drive safe and not wreckless. ========  I went through a really bad thunderstorm.  Big droplets of rain were coming down as if it hasn't rained for a millenia.  The droplets then turned into hail.  The hail was small enough that I wasn't worried that it could cause some body damage or whatever.  There was a lot of lightning going on.  Once the big ones start striking together, it would light up the whole night sky with this eeri glow.  Innannimate objects looked murderous and at the same time calm.  Yes, it was a little fucked up.  Amongst the lightning and thunder and hail, there was a little funnel cloud that I spotted after the lightning show commenced.  It was cool to see shit like that and I was glad that it was far enough away that it couldn't reach the highway just yet.  Yeah.  cool shit.  Got to Sam's and hung out there for a while.  Met his girlfriend, Laura.  what a sweet girl.  I didn't really talk to her a lot but we did interact somewhat.  I asked how they met and the regular rigamarole.  She was so sweet and nice that I felt bad for making off color comments and shit like that for fear of disapproval.  They seem really comfortable with each other and make each other happy and content.  It's good to see that someone with pure intentions actually give Sam the attention and devotion that he deserves since he as been through a lot with his previous shit.  I also met this chick Janine.  She's seems like a free spirit.  very easy to talk to and open minded.  She was cool.  We then proceeded to watch Battle Royal.  I don't know if anyone else has seen it but t's about a class that get's drugged and put on an island to kill each other.  The kids in this movie, not just the class but the whole "kid" population just doesn't respect the elders anymore and are just a bunch of deliquents.  So there's this Battle Royal Act that was passed alowing military people to kidnap and put these kids into this competition or something like that.  Anyways, I got the people that were there to be into the movie.  I was glad that they were starting to like it.  The we got this drunk ass who walks in with his drunk ass girlfriend.  So there we were watching the movie and peole are into it then bam, drunk ass comes and barges in and is all loud about the movie and making fun of how they spoke, how it was a useless movie because "you had to read what they were takin'" yeah, it was just not a good sight.  I was starting to get irritated by all of this because of the fact that I was tired and this guy was being rude.  Not only to me but to the other two people who were watching the movie before he walked in and made himself that center of drunk attention.  His girlfriend on the other hand couldn't stop talking.  She just couldn't  They already went to the bar and had a few drinks there.  She was already "Feelin' good" as she sptly put it.  She couldn't stop proclaiming that she was feeling good and frankly, it was starting to get annoying.  Here I was trying to "read what they were talkin'" and at the same time tune out the constant babble that was all about being drunk.  It was just too hard.  Then I thought to myself, "Well, they really don't know what they are doing and they're not really doing it on purpose so why am I getting upset?"  I just rolled with it, cracked open another beer and lit up a smoke and tried to have fun with the rest of the people there.  then Meghan called, I took a much needed break from all the rowdiness to have a nice talk with my girlfriend.  Yes, Meghan, my girlfriend.  We talked about the party that she was going to go to the next night.  Who was going to be there, food that was supposed to be bought.  We talked about what would happen is her ex showed up.  We talked about our day.  It was nice.  went back in and socialized with the rest of everyone.  Went to bed around 4.  Saturday was just a dissapointing day.  Didn't see Bryce.  ======== See previous post ========  went to King Buffet.  It was your typical chinese buffet with all the regular goodies that you might expect from a place like this.  Fried rice, white rice, lo lein noodles, chicken on a stick, kun pow chicken, egg drop soup, hot and sour soup, spring rolls, egg rolls, sea food combo, peppered beef and etc etc etc.  Yeah I was full.  Since Jenny didn't call back nor answer the fucking phone, we went and saw Kill Bill.  It's not like I didn't want to see it, I wanted to but I was looking forward to seeing my kid before that.  Alas, none of that.  KD V2 was alright.  Well, it was good.  Liked the kung fu a lot.  Liked the shots.  The cheesy 70's music playing.  Liked the story and the twist.  Liked the movie.  Not better than the first one but still good.  after that we decided to go to this sports store because I was looking for some shoes.  I need new shoes for the trip to NY City that I'm taking Meghan with.  That should be fun.  We're going to experience NY City on a college budget.  This will prove to be more memorable from the long drives to the crappy motels that we will be staying at.  It should be fun.  Back to Iowa, yeah after Kill Bill, we went to this store that looked like a Galyans but it wasn't.  It was some sort of hunting outdoor shit super store!  It was still fun.  We played with stupid orange hats.  I wore these white trash hats that made me look retarded.  Ahh, it was fun because even the regular shoppers there were smirking at my stupidy.  Whatever, as long as no one gets hurt, it's all good.  After that, Sam and Laura went and said Hi to Moe at Walmart.  I just stayed in the car becase I tried to call Jenny and then I wanted to talk to Meghan.  Jenny was being a bitch  Meghan was as accomodating as one can get when busy.  It was sweet.  After talking to her, I felt better.  After that she went to her party and we just hung out at Sam's house.  Oh we also played basketball.  God it was hot.  I needed a couple of glasses of water since I lost so much water through sweat.  Eh it was still fun.  I enjoyed.  After that we hung out.  Yeah.  hung out and watched SNL.  It really isn't that good anymore.  Grr. Grr. Grr.  Had a few beers and everyone gravitated towards Sam's room around 3 so I decided to go to bed.  around 6 aM.  A drunk girl calls me on the phone.  hehe.  It's my girlfriend.  Wow and she seemed loaded.  It was cute.  (okay okay, I will stop spreading the drunkeness).  HeHe.  what a cutie.  Sunday  Yeah.  Let's just say it was a lot of driving.  again, let's not talk about the other shit that happened but I left Iowa around 10:30 and got to IL around 2:30 in the afternoon.  Cubs were still playing.  I wanted to see Meghan so I did.  I drove all the way from Iowa to Michigan.  Yeah, I am crazy.  It was worth it.  Apparently Meghan had a lot of fun the night before and was still paying for it.  Cute.  Live and learn I suppose.  Well for this instance it's drink and learn.  We hung out.  Ate a little bit of food and was just lazy.  She did homework and I tried to do Japanese.  I could't Eh, it's alright.  I got there and was prety damn tired but managed to do stuff still.  We went and had Subway and rented sprit away.  Great movie.  I want to see it again.  we tried to sleep but found it a challenge.  Next morning.  I wasn't feeling the leat bit able to go to work.  I had some sort of bug it was terrible.  Joint sche.  stuffy nose.  Slight fever.  Maybe it was from the window being open all night.  I dunno.  I just felt like crap and would pass out if I tried to drive anywhere.  So I stayed an extra day trying to recuperate.  The next day I was let loose in the town of East Lansing, MI.  There were a ton of hotties around.  It really was spring when you see a lot more girls with a lot more skin showing.  It was Hot!  There were a couple of times during the day when things weren't as pleasant but overall it was still a good time spent with my girlfriend.  here at work now.  Drove a lot this weekend.  It was fun.  I suppose I am practicing for the New York Drive.  I can't wait to go on vacation.  I'm due for one.  It should be a good time.  Sigh, back to work.
