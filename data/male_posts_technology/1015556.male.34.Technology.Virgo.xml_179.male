X.   urlLink Please Understand Me  Great resource for building teams, both mission teams and leader teams. X.   urlLink Short Term Missions Workbook  Excellent studies to work through with mission teams. X.   urlLink Parenting Today's Adolscent  The Rainey's talk about the most common traps of adolescence and, almost more importantly, pre-adolescence. X.   urlLink Transforming Leadership  Jesus as the model of leadership X.   urlLink Decision Making and the Will of God  What is God's will?  Better yet, let's understand a clear strategy for making decisions. X.   urlLink Youth Builder  Good overall youth ministry resource. X.   urlLink Perspectives Reader  The text from the Perspectives class.  Speaks for itself. X.   urlLink Operation World  Yeah buddy. X.   urlLink Intensive Care  Subtitle "Helping Teenagers in Crisis"  Hmm..  Interesting list, because I just realized that I don't really have a lot of books about youth ministry specifically.  I guess in thinking about it, I've really been modeled for ministry by mentors versus reading youth ministry books.  That's probably not a big suprise to anyone reading this, if you have been involved in ministry, you have probably learned by working closely side by side with someone, seen their passion, seen what motivates them, seen how they connect with students.  Anyway, enjoy the list for what its worth. Also note that there I didn't number them.
