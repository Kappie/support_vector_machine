Any way I was doing some reading over at  urlLink straightdope.com  and found this  urlLink article .  Basically if a mosquito lands on you let him bite you.  It's kinda hard to let him do it because everyone's reaction is to kill them.  Anyway, once he bites you stretch your skin.  Her needle will get stuck, and she can't stop the blood from coming in.  She will eventually rupture.    I know it's kinda a sick way for them to die.  But they are stealing your blood.  Once they bite you, you will still get a mosquito bump any way...  So you might as well kill them slowly :P
