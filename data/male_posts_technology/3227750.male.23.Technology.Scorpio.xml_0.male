My day, by and large, was uneventful in that interesting way that you all care about. It's been long and frustrating at times. Most notably, my boss expressed frustration with regard to why what I've been working on fixing isn't fixed yet and expressed that he was losing confidence in my abilities to do the sort of work required for this job I have. eep. =-( On an upshot, though, our "little talk" got me to disregard the advice of the guy I've been listening to for advice and information and returned me on my original path...which got me to exactly the milestone that my boss was looking for...after he left for the day. My only concern is that he'll think that I wasn't really working for the last couple weeks and really laid it on and got it done after he talked to me.... c'est la vie.  But on an upshot, I hung out with a co-worker for a good 45 minutes after work today and we had a great conversation about everything from why I think higher gas prices (not too high!) are a good thing to why computers are evil (only a half-truth). It was quite nice and a nice change of pace from the relentless staring at my laptop screen all day long.  After work, I did a bit of a cursory cleanup of my apartment and it's looking a bit neater. Most notably, I've gotta sit down and spend the 2-3 hours getting all the wiring to my computers bundled up and done neatly and correctly. Aside from that, most of my evening has been awash. And here I am, spending probably too much time writing a blog entry (twice, no less....). But that's alright. I need a break from work -- it's been a very long day. =-)  As for the illustrious Cathy E., she ditched me. For her grandmother. *sigh* I can't hold a grudge against her, however, so I'm still going to wish her a happy summer and good times in Washington DC. If there will be mad boozing involved, I might have to go down and assist in her 21st birthday celebrations, although I havne't discussed this with relevant parties yet, so surprise to all those affected! =-)  The rest of what I promised from yesterday will have to wait until the next post. I'm not in the mood to, nor do I have the energy to talk about any of that.  Alas, I'm out of energy and time. The phone is ringing and it's CJ. Like yesterday, I'd rather not end my second post with something as shallow and thoughtless as "I'm tired." So I guess I'll leave you with a quote:  I remember we were kids watching children's shows, and they'd have maybe three round objects and one square object or three white objects and one black object and they'd be asking, "which one of these things doesn't belong?" and I can remember thinking, "why doesn't this thing belong?" You know, I mean, why would anything be put on the planet that didn't belong? There's a place for everything. I can just think being taught that from an early age it just lets you see why there is so much prejudice and injustice in the world... but I guess there's a place for that too. - Victor Wooten,  A Show of Hands
