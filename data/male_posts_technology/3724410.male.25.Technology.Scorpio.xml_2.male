Unlike other bollywood flicks, this story doesn't have "and they lived happily ever after..." as they break off in the end and for a change, this is real life..   It all started when the guy meets the girl in a bank where he just got smitten by her attitude..the way she interacted, the way she convinced him. He invited her for a coffee...she came, they sat together..as usual the guy started in a flirting mode trying to impress her so that he can have few good moments..but he never knew..how far it will go ?   They clicked..went out for dinner one night..then other night..then every other time whenever they got a chance...the girl used to like the guy's attitude , his way of living, the independence he gave to her..and never questioned her individuality..and the guy liked the lifestyle of the girl , totally funloving character..the way he wanted his partner to be..   things were fine..soon they found themselves in love with each other..then those three golden words got exchanged...   finally, they talked about marriage..guy was a bit reluctant though as he thought his parents may not like the idea but the girl was insistent on that...she pestered the guy to ask for permission from his parents...and she agreed to ask her parents which she said that they would never refuse...then guy asked his parents..they agreed readily...the girl asked her parents..they refused..  her dad asked her to leave home if she wanted to marry that guy...   The time for decision came...they decided to break - off ..the girl asked the guy to forget her..the guy said that he could not do so but she didn't agree.. the guy said when he could leave everything for her..why can't she ? but she replied that she could not bear the hardships in life..so let's part the ways..   and they soon will be seperate..on their own paths.. the guy will soon go back to his place and the girl will get married to some same caste guy who'll be rich and highly settled may be abroad..   anyway..it ends with...   dil diya pyar ki had thi,  jaan di aitbaar ki had thi,  mar gaye hum khuli rahi aankhen,  yeh mere intezzar ki had thi.
