Well yesterday evening I spent some time with Sally the mother of a friend of mine, I was astounded of the Joy that God had shown me. Her Salmon was great. A meal fit for a King. Also To speak with her and see the Glory that is god living in the lives of those who rarely can show their light to others. I realize sometimes that like Sally there are people who are hidden from the world but not from the face and the ear of God. Even when we cannot get out. If we are basically prisioners of our own home. Our own choices or of our own soul The lords sees through al andl sees the heart and will deliver us. Such Joy the Lord has brought me. In helping me understand the meaning of Shining bright even when noone is around to see the light.   Thank you again Lord for this great experience in taking part in your journey even when I am so wretched a man as I am!
