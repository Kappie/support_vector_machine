I once went to the Disney park in California, and it was fucking awful. They only had one good ride, and I think Caroline doesn't work there anymore anyway. Who cares about a mouse with a head like a wingnut pissing around with brooms and books? Compared to the mighty bastion of cartoons, " urlLink "Looney Tunes?"    It must be time for Disney v Looney Tunes!   ROUND ONE      V        +       Mickey Mouse v. Tweety Pie, but Tweety Pie has a Glock 17.  Mickey has large, flappy ears, which he could use to distract Tweety before Tweety had time to clok his 'G. Tweety also has no opposable thumb, which could prove a problem when aiming the 9 milly. However, 3 seconds later Mickey would be smoked.  ROUND TWO      V        +      Marvin the Martin v. Bambi, but Bambi has a AK-47.  On the face of it, Bambi has no chance. However, Marvin would teleport back to his space ship and Death Star Bambi's skinny ass with his fricking laser.  ROUND THREE      V        +      Foghorn Leghorn v. Hercules in a B2 Stealth Bomber.  Hercules is cleared for take off and makes good progress towards Foghorn's chicken coup. However as he tries to release his payload his biceps get caught in the cockpit and put him in a flat spin, screaming "Goose" I can't reach the ejection handle!"  End Result: Warner Brothers 3, Disney Nil.
