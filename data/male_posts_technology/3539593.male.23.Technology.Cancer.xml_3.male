I must be coming down with something.  Breaking in the dancing feet again.  There's nothing quite like the guilty pleasure of blasting 'NSYNC and Backstreet and busting out some new moves across the family-room floor when you're home alone.   urlLink Tom Cruise  would be proud.  I seem to have gotten the spring back to my step again.  The knees aren't aching any more.  There's nothing worse than creaky joints before you make it half-way to middle-age.  (Side note: I seem to be going hyphen-happy lately - weird)  I just wrote something interesting, but lost it when I went to  urlLink dictionary.com  to look up the word 'sans'.  I knew I knew what it meant, but I wanted to be sure.  Part of my newly blossoming, self-imposed OCD I suppose.  And now I've gone and lost a paragraph that I was excited to write.  I mean, how many times do you get to use 'sans' in casual conversation?   Paragraph sans excitement. Paragraph sans point. Oh well.  I find myself utterly paralyzed, staring at the trees blowing in the wind.  I thought it chintzy when John Travolta did it in  urlLink Phenomenon , but there's something to be said for simple pleasures.  Idle tree watching would be tops on my list.  Followed closely by supermanning into my super-soft futon, slipping on socks fresh from the dryer on a chilly day, mint lip balm, and of course killing kittens.  (Side note: I would never, in fact,  urlLink harm a kitten  - chickens on the other hand, they just creep me out and I'm happy to  urlLink commit mass chickencide  - you see I knew this flock of free range chickens when I was in Australia - they were awesome - anyways, my favorite chook somehow hurt hurself and started bleeding when suddenly her carniverous band of merry hens decided to peck her to death and fight over her vital organs - if that doesn't convince you  urlLink this will )  Good God, I can't believe I'm up before noon.  I just don't know what to do with myself.  I suppose I should go out and enjoy the sun while it's decided to make an appearance, but I'm afraid it's just a hoax.  Mother Nature luring us outside so She can dump two more weeks of rain on our heads.  Just to punish us further for living in Maine.  I can't wait to get out of this place.  But I will miss it.
