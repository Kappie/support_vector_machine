For your information they came in at number 10 on the  urlLink 2000 Hottest 100  with the sublime 'Bohemian Like You' and, less impressively, no 89 on the  urlLink 1997 Hottest 100  with 'Last Junkie On Earth' and 'Get Off' is one of my favourite songs, I would totally make out with  urlLink Courtney , and it WAS  urlLink them because they played Glasgow Academy on Friday night.   If I wasn't already jealous enough of your Glaswegian jaunt and your Marks and Spencers food I am now officially green with envy.   Oh, and Gede - watch out for that stove. I'm speaking from experience :) :)
