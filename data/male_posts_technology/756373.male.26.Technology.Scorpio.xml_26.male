It has armrests and wheels and it's one of those long backed jobbies that make you go 'ooh, nice chair' That impression dissappears quickly once you actually SIT in the damn thing. First of all the backrest angle is not adjustable, and I find that it leans back too much, forcing me to sit bolt upright with my back not actually touching the back rest. Hello stupid chair designers? They call it a back rest for a bloody reason! But perhaps the single most annoying thing about this chair is the material. It's like kevlar or something. You slip around in it like a greased eel in an oil slick. Nothing wants to stay put. Personally I prefer those chairs with a 'carpet' style finish since my butt isn't constantly trying to wriggle out of said chairs.  Come 3PM every day it's the same, I'm squirming and grunting and trying my level best to get comfortable, but to no avail. So there you have it folks, concrete proof why I'm such a grumpy sod. Damn chair.
