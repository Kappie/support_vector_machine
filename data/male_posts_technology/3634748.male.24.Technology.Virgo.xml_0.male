Both rural and urban scenery can be very beautiful, and when a person is spending time on the road, with a tank-like SUV breathing down the back of their neck while still speeding, it's a nice break to be able to look out and see things that aren't inherently stressful.  Rolling hills, the sun hitting a cityscape just so, whatever.  Nowhere amongst these pretty things is a giant rude advertisement.  And certainly not one flashing Dubbya's evil smirk, like the one just put up in the small area between where I live and where I work.     "God Bless America", it says in enormous type, as if to flaunt and celebrate the idea that the barrier that is supposed to exist between church and state has been eroded more quickly under this administration than a sugar cube dropped into boiling acid.  "November 2 Reelect Our President", it urges.  Couple of things wrong with that.  He wasn't elected in the first place, so re-election is sort of out of the question just by definition.  And even if he had been elected, there's no way in hell any sane person would want it to happen again.  Let's recap.   urlLink Tax   urlLink breaks  and  urlLink loopholes  that affect the wealthiest echelons of our country almost exclusively.  A  urlLink joke of an education policy  (that leaves plenty of children behind, thanks very much) complete with a  urlLink gutting of educational funding .  A four-year  urlLink transformation   from the economy's  urlLink ample surplus to its largest defecit in history .  Great surges in IT, manufacturing, and many other industries...  urlLink in India and China .  Unprovoked war driven by  urlLink greed for power  and  urlLink wealth .  So no, actually, I don't consider this continent (or country) "blessed" by anything, man, deity or otherwise, and I'm sure as hell not going to do anything that would help sustain the ridiculous mess we're in.  And I'll say that twice a day for as long as I have to.  ...added later...  These things must be springing up all over!
