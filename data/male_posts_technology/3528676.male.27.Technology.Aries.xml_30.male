Of course I had to agree.  The graphics were excellent, Its as if actors were playing the game's characters.  They looked real.  The ball playing and the boxing games feel like your watching the NBA or watching at Caesar's Palace...only you're the one moving the guys.  I couldn't help but recall where my cousin and I started out when we were kids.  We were in front of a black and white TV all day during the summer...playing   Double Dragon  !!  Before   PS 2   and   X-box  , before   Dreamcast   and   Playstation  , HECK! even  before the   SEGA Saturn  , there was the small red and white console in every home called the   Family Computer  . Every kid had it.  No question.  We weren't rich, but we had it. It cost around P2,000 or so at that time, a lot for a 10 yeasr old back in 1989. But our Tito Ed bought us our own and we loved him for it.  We all have our favorite games, here are mine.         PACMAN . Although originally released for play on the original  Atari console.  You can't NOT hate this game.  Probably  everyone's introduction to computer games.  Hindi pa rin siya  nakakasawa.          YIE-AR KUNG FU .  This is the only screenshot I could steal  off the net.  I like it because it is basic.  a- punc h, b-   kick . up arrow- jump , down arrow- duck ...easy.  you dont need  to be specially fast to beat the enemy.  Something a gaming  doofus like me would enjoy playing.         DOUBLE DRAGON . I remember cussing in front of the TV after  getting beaten in this game.   Pagagalitan ako ni Mama   afterwards. When my uncle bought this game, i had my exams  the morning after.  I could not concentrate. I couldn't wait  to get home to play Double Dragon.  I remember playing all  day after school, not thinking of my Science exam the next  day.  My mama had to pry my hands away from the joystick with  a crowbar to keep me from playing this game. The graphics were way cooler in this game compared to the  other games during its time.  There were many stages, and I  love fighting   Abobo  !         ROCKMAN .  This game will forever remain the greatest 8-bit  game of all time, second only to   Mario Brothers  . I remember  being obsessed with this game. I told you that I suck at  video games, I have to confess, I NEVER finished it.  My  cousin Blue was the KING of   Rockman  .  It would only take days  of after-school play for him to beat   Cut man  ,   Elec Man   and    Clash Man   and eventually get to   Dr. Wily  .  He did the same w  ith   Rockman 2  .  I could spend a whole day just watching  someone play this game and finish it.         SUPER MARIO BROS. .What   "The Godfather"   is to movies.   "Super  Mario Brothers"   is to video games.  Nobody would have gone  through a normal childhood in the late 80's if he did not  play Supe  r Mario  .  If I'm not mistaken, the concept of  putting sub stages within stages was introduced in this game.  This was also the pioneer of the secret path to stage  selection.  If this does not bring back memories of your  childhood, nothing will.  The mere intro  "Tenen-ten, te-nen,  ten!"  is enough to bring tears to my eyes....Y_Y         THE GOONIES . Although the game was very far off from the  original movie story,  this has got to be the best developed  video game adaptation of a popular hollywood movie at that  time.  We all know that the bottom line for any video games'  success is its playability, regardless of it's movie or TV  franchise.  I have to say, even experts find this game tough.  Primarily because of its tremendous stages. My fingers got  tired just making that boy walk around!         GALAGA . Classic. Simple. It may be one of the most primitive of the games here, but who doesn't love it?  The principles are simple. Shoot them all before they get down to earth while dodging away from their " Bug lasers ".  I see people in the office playing this game and pac man over the internet. Usually its the older guys like the Manager.         DIG DUG . Who didn't have that  500 in 1  game cartridge when they first came out?  Now you can see these games strategically imbedded in cheap VCD players sold in Greenhills, but back then, you had a great deal whan you had " 500 in one ". This was usually a staple in those cartridges.  I never played this game. I thought it sucked.  But whenever anyone opens the topic of   Nintendo   or   Family Computer  , this somehow pops into my head first.          SUPER CONTRA . If you didn't like this game,  BAKLA KA !  Simple as that!  I had this fantasy that they would make amovie out of this game starring   Sylvester Stallone   as the guy in blue and   Arnold Schwarzenegger   as the guy in purple.  I guess everyone else had the same idea, huh? Comments Please!            POOYAN  . My brothers ans sister will not forgive me if i did not include this game.  Although this is more of my siblings' favorite, it brings back a lot of memories from when we still had a small black and white tv to play all our games in.  My brother Jon even made a " Pooyan dance ".  I'd show you how it goes but you'd ask me to stop doing it midway.
