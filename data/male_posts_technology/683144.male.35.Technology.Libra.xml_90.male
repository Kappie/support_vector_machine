From this I can deduce one or more of the following possibilities:  1) people feel that this blog is boring and/or is no longer worth reading 2) people already have a Gmail account and don't want to talk or read about it 3) the bulk of the traffic was only interested in getting a Gmail invite and figured this would be a good place to find one. (I do actually have some invites still, BTW). 4) saturation from other Gmail-related blogs and websites. There are a lot of them out there, though I notice a pattern of them starting to die slow deaths. 5) fill in the blank: ___________  I'll continue to update this blog as there are new things in the Gmail-sphere to talk about. If there is a Gmail-related topic that you, gentle reader, are specifically interested in then please use the comment area to tell me about it.  And BTW, I have now used over 70% of my 1 gig of Gmail space.
