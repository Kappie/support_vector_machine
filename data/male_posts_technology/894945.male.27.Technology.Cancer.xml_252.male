Not trying to be horrible but to be honest Alex hasn't got a clue about the outside world!! He goes to work and then goes home to sit at his computer all day and night!! (no offense meant Alex). I maintain that this post was not in the best interest of our readers. Anyone who thinks that the unjust murder of anyone is funny is a prick in my books. Thank you...Baity signing off...............
