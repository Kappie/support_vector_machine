From  urlLink CNN :  Thursday's attack brought the number of U.S. troops who have been reported dead since the start of the war to  879  -- 656 of them were killed by hostile fire.  The number of multinational forces reported to have been killed in the war is  999 .   Also this interesting story:  The United States removed nearly two tons of radiological and nuclear materials from Iraq last month, according to the Energy Department. The material could have potentially been used to make a "radiological dispersal device" -- a so-called dirty bomb -- "or diverted to support a nuclear weapons program," the department said Tuesday.    Of course, the official Pentagon press release (which got reported widely in the media) doesn't tell the whole story.  From the  urlLink Washington Post :  The International Atomic Energy Agency kept Iraq's uranium under seal in storage facilities for more than a decade before the U.S. invasion in March 2003, but the storerooms were looted when Baghdad fell several weeks later.   The IAEA was allowed back into Iraq to help clean up the facility, and it urged U.S. officials to protect Iraq's former weapons sites from further looting.   But in recent months, radioactive equipment and Iraqi weapons components have been showing up in scrap yards and ports in Europe and the Middle East.   So it's a huge victory for Bush that 2 tons of nuclear material was removed one year after the war (however 400 tons remain). But what about the nuclear material looted after the fall of Bagdhad. You'd think that would be the FIRST thing the U.S. Military would have protected, even more than the ministry office buildings.
