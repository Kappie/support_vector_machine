What do you give the guy who loves gadgets and has all the gadgets...he he he...but trust me I still could do with some more. I have my eyes on a cool looking flat panel TV's, the kinds you could hang on the wall and admire all day long. But my wife says her credit card does not have that much limit, yea right.  But, as everyone knows I am a humble guy and would settle for something cheaper like a Sony DVD Handycam Camcorder which is available on eBay pretty cheap. You know what, this year I was pretty slick and left the catalog for Sharper Image open on an item I would have loved to have, forgot what it was, do you think she got the hint?  No matter what I wrote it on my whiteboard at home:  Dad does not want any of these for father's day:  Ties / clothes / gift certificates / rain checks / watch / books  I will let you guys know what I finally end up with on father's day. Keep your fingers crossed just as I will for all you dads out there.  Happy Father's Day !
