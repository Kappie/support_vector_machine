I think most kids are a tiny bit psychic, but when you grow up you talk yourself out of believing in that "little voice" from the subconscious.  But you hear all the time about stories where someone didn't get on a plane, or knew to call someone at the right time, etc.  I take that back, I think maybe boys lose that ability at age 6 and never regain it, while girls are just a little psychic for a while longer.  My son specifically, and boys generally have a problem with this; hindsight is more like 20-200, not 20-20, and foresight is beyond the realm of belief.  Things like Nintendo and Captain Underpants and Spongebob Squarepants get in the way of logic, planning, reponsibility, etc.  Boys also have a general interest in anything involving the crotch area or flatulence; this finally wanes at about age 30 and returns at age 40 until death.
