Here is what happened and why this is being protested.  Apparently there was a fly ball to the outfield and a runner at 3rd. The runner waited till the catch was made and then tagged up and started to run. Half way he decided he wasn't going to make it, so he went back to third. The ball was thrown to 3rd, and the runner was called out but the 3rd baseman just tagging the bag. This is a wrong call by the ump.  No this is where it gets tricky. The team in question is with a some what friend that got me in the league this year. She is the coach of that team and I am no the other team from our town. The umpire is the father of a childhood friend. So either way I vote someone will be pissed that I will have to deal with.  Being an umpire myself for little league games I know it isn't easy. Especially if you are by yourself, which this ump was. I feel back cause I know how hard it is to keep track of everything. So I am a little bias going into this, but we will see what happens.
