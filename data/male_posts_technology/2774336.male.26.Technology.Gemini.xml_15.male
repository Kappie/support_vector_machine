What a rough night. Although I had been eating the same thing all day without problem ( urlLink MM's  and Water) I ran into big trouble at about 2:30 in the morning. I was still up chatting online and the stomach started to complain. I started belching and within 10 minutes I was very nauseous. It lasted for about fourty minutes, most of which I was sure I was going to vomit, and then it was as if some barrier finally broke. I was able to belch several long and fulfilling times, and it was over as fast as it started. I wish that I understood what was causing all this gas to build up, and what more was causing me so much difficulty in releasing it. 

 Obviously my diet of candy and water yesterday is not helpful to my condition. I don't normally eat in that manner and its really a terrible way to start a health log! Today I'm vowing to do a much better job, and maybe this log will keep me honest. So far I've started the day (at around 11:00 am) with a small glass of  urlLink Pedialyte . Yes, its for infants, but sometimes after feeling particularly ill I spend the next day with cotton mouth and the Pedialyte helps to re-hydrate my body while being easy on the stomach. 

 So its 1:15 now and I haven't yet eaten anything solid. My stomach is starting to have the waves of pain and cramping again that I'm associating with an ulcer, although I'm just guessing at that. I'm going to go have some lunch and a Zantac.
