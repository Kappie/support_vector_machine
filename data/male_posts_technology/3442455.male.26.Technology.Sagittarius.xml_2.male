From this I can draw one of two conclusions about this mad dummy in a pink shirt.  Either this woman is being totally ironic, or she is crying out desperately for help.  I daydreamed that I helped her out by snatching the folder out of her hand and violently projected all of the contents throughout the train in to the hands of all the passengers.  She was asking for it.  She feels better now.  I freed her. I'm such a nice guy.
