They are letting me stay in one of the hotel rooms they got for my sister and them. It was the first time in 3 months that I spent the night in a room by myself.  Quite possibly the best night of sleep I ever had... besides the hostel guys calling me at 2:30am.  And it was nice not to have bed bugs too.  And then my sister arrived yesterday so all of us are here now which is great.  Although the elevator did break at the hotel so to get back to the room we had to climb 19 flights of stairs.  Good times.
