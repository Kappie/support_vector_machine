Taking the Gmail efforts further with some nice javascripting, looks like soon we might have full fledged editors via the web. The current  interface provides the basic funtionality of  font ,  size , text alignment, inserting links , back ground colors, spell checking, numbered and bullet point lists.     Even the keyboard shortcuts work!     Here's the  urlLink screenshot  for how it looks.    Blogger. com doesn't provide an image upload service. I just tried at Flickr. I thought it would give me a direct url for an image which I make public, but it didn't do that. So for now I need to look for another photo upload service.
