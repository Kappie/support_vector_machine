New policy:  Region War!  ...And Tuesday, in an interview on ABC's "Nightline," White House national security adviser Condoleezza Rice said that one of the reasons Bush went to war against Saddam was because he posed a threat in "a region from which the 9/11 threat emerged."  I wonder how one measures a Region.  Is it much like Risk?  If so, can we just take all of Asia and get 7 armies next turn?
