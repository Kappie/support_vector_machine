All my friends are mad that I am moving but I am pretty excited. I have slept almost everynight of my life in this house and have seen the same things every day, in this city. I will have a great 5 acres and a lot of time to do nothing.  School is frustrating, I usually do well, and I have only gotten about 3 or 4 b's this year, the rest are A's. I am just sick of it, I can't work in class listening to random people yell "britney!" in the most annoying voice that you could think of. I obviously have more common sense than everyone, besides my group of friends (followers, leaders, and entertainers). It is all ending next wednesday. I am tires of being around a bunch of dumbasses. I knew I should have taken pre-ap, but I was convinced that all it was is more work. I was the one punished for wanting to learn without being overworked.  Hi Shelby...  I am gonna miss my friends, and I have heard from some of their moms that they are already getting mad about it. I have a few friends, all of them really close. The others, I just wish they would leave me alone.  My b-day is coming up this friday, amazingly I will turn 13. Even though I am more mature than 2/3 of my class I am one or two years younger than them. All I want is money for  urlLink anime-kon . I will probably buy a thousand plushies and have more fun than I can bear. I get to choose where I get to eat that night, but I have no idea...  I am looking forward to all of this stuff coming up, some good, some bad. But they are all part of destiny...  Best sister ever Shelby, you rock!  ^_^
