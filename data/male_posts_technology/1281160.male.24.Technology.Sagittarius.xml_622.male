Again i too feel that implementing is time consuming. but then when u have done enough to create a blog with much sophistication, i think doing this will take a day or so more.And i think its not going to be much difficult if u just cut the first para and paste it and provide a link to that blog. It will remain permanent till another interesting article pops up. since u visit our blog daily and has got admin rights, u can do it in minutes time since u need to fiddle with the template to post it permanently till next change.   More over Recent posts gives me the list of titles which has happened in a week. But it doesnt give me the content and prompt me to read. Where as what i am talking about is like reading those few lines must prompt every one to read and in the end it should let them leave with a feel of having read something good as i felt in the end, after reading the down posted article. So that was my idea.  That article on sun is again not as expected. Summa summa bhaya muruthaatha. This is also a very old news. Have u heard of elnino few years back. Its much based on such natural calamities on Earth due to celestial changes. and having a solar flare is not new to us too. Get me some thing new original and fresh! And even if i keep blogging, then thats all i too will loose my job one day. But never mind, by that time i would have got another one!  Dear jax, i am not a fairy to grant all the wishes u have. But surely i will put a request to Santa to grant all ur wishes come true this christmas. By the way started anticipating christmas or u too are feeling like Vijay and manny as they felt towards Diwali.......  Source of that BCP article is not known as it came as a forwarded message from srini. So i cant help u out even this time!  Raama, nee engagement kathai solliye thapichittu irukka. Sari parava illai poittu vaa. and snaps 500k kulla anupina download panna vasthiya irukkum. sariya.  sorry vijay that day when i was chatting with u, there was a disconnection and so couldnt proceed further. anyway All the best and happy journey ya.
