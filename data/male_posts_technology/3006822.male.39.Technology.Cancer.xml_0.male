Over the coming months (and years), I will outline for you:  what is a flaw; a fault; what are these flaws and faults about; how did that stuff get in my wine; and what (if anything) can be done about this.  Although Cesear was warned about the Ides of March, my research indicates that we are safe launching on "the Ides" of March.  (an ide is actually just a calendar manipulation and is not a holiday and many months have ides.)  Again, once we know the facts, things like wine become less scary.  Please come back often, as my goal is to make this a weekly update.  As such, the first edition will be uploaded on March 17th.
