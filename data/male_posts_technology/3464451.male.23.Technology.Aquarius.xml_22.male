I am happy I finally got my offer from Huntsville Alabama.  I am moving:) :)   Yeah me...  well, I am kinda happy about it.. I am glad to be getting away from everything up here and just worry about something so new that will take all my time from bull S***...  But, I just miss having someone to come with me or even just be up here for me ya know? I mean, really, I don't know what to do...  I am trying to take care of all my stuff before I leave but I know I won't nor do I want to take care of all of it...  there is some of it that I don't really want to deal with....    What I would love, is to talk to this new chick, tell her he ain't worth shit, and come with me because she is so wonderful but ya know what... it ain't meant to be if she wants to be with him so....   later taters...   I am out... moving... getting away from everything and just moving on with my life...  moving down south. happy and alone.   I guess it's just everything big thing in my life that I have done, it's been alone.  I just want someone to be there with me every step of the way and I don't get that and I don't know what to do...  I want it so bad but how??  I don't know what to do with someone...   I know the move is going to be great for me and get me away from everything...  a better job, possible better people to be around and just a better environment but...  I will miss my family, some friends..... you know who you are, and just some other things..  I guess in the end... I hate being alone even though I have been alone through every big change in my life and there have been oooohhh....  hmmmm...  five changes not counting this one......   just one person to be there through it....  ah welll  *sigh*   just gotta go with it and deal with life because, what else is there....  well everyone, will talk to you soon.  that is a lot of stuff about me personally...   take care:)
