Yup, it's exactly 26 years ago that i came into this world in my birthday suit with a HUGE smile on my face (hmm ... or was it kicking and screaming ?). The most popular question of the day : What's my birthday wish ? Well, my birthday wish is to have unlimited wishes, haha. Can that happen ? If yes, then this is wat i will wish for :   Wish 1 :  World peace  Wish 2 :  A job that requires me to sit and laze around all day by the seaside preferably in Mauritius, Maui, Hawaii or Bora-Bora. Oh yah, with tons of $$$ too :)  Wish 3 :  To visit each  every single country on this Earth.  Wish 4 :  To be the President of USA  Back to the invite. Well, what can i say ? It's because of "Great Moments at Work" that we (Ms SN  myself) are able to come up with it. Thanks to all for your birthday wishes, gifts, cards  time but most of all, thank you for remembering. And to Ms SN, happy birthday to you too ! May all your wishes  prayers come true ....  I usually celebrate my birthday with a sombre dinner with my family and friends but being in my present company, it's very very happening indeed. We started yesterday's evening celebration at Bar Fly; man, the things i'd do when i had too much to drink. I can't wait to see the pics taken and will post them up here. I had a glass of beer (bottoms up), a Flaming Lamborghini shared with Ms SN (which she didn't drink much) and many rounds of Black Label + Coke.  Then we sojourned to Red Box at Sunway Pyramid where my boss was having a party there too. Truth to be told, yesterday was the first time i actually sang (if u can call that singing) at a karaoke joint. But it was a good singing/shouting session, releasing all the pent up anger and energy. It's simply amazing what alcohol can do to you :)  After all the fun  excitement, it was time to go home. As usual, Mum was waiting at the door, haha .... Scolding me for returning home so late (Mum .... It was only 2:30am ler ....) I had to remind her that i'm 26 this year, no longer a little boy but a man. But then again, boys will always be boys in our Mum's eyes. Good ole' Mum ....  So, once again, happy birthday to Ms SN ! Happy birthday JaMok (hey, that's me lar) !  Savvy ;)
