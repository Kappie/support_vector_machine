Hmmm.... I think Kicah has been doing too much reading and Rini too much thinking.  As Kicha has pointed out, I may not be able to blog as much as I usually did in the past, you can blame the lack of net access at Manny's company for that.  But if you had noticed, I had posted a few posts at  urlLink QSS  in the recent past.
