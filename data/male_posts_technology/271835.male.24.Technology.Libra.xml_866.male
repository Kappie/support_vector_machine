Guess who has just recieved some tickets for  urlLink TOTP Gateshead  next week? I applied for them for the wife's sister but i don't think she can make it. I will find out and if she can't we shall have a real prize for a NewLinks compo.They would be no good to us as the music is crap and we are too old! :)
