One thing that came up was my fear that what actually did happen would happen. Fear is a funny thing. On the one hand, it crushes your spirit, destroys your body and dampens your enthusiasm; on the other hand, fear is a necessary adjunct to living. It prepares you for extreme circumstances (Fight or Flight) and prevents you from engaging in things that may cause your bodily harm (Taking a beer away from Camerak, for example). So, what do YOU fear?  As some people may or may not know, I'm quite claustrophobic. If I'm travelling as a passenger in a vehicle, more often than not you'll see me huddled up against the window; and if I'm not at a window, I'll be asleep (or some reasonable variant therein, eyes closed, breathing slowly). When I book flights, I always using the seating arrangements to ensure I have a window seat. If I can't get a window seat, I'll take an aisle seat...but I really cannot stand sitting between two people; there's something quite debilitating about being stuck between two people. A while back, on a 1 hour flight to Calgary, I was trapped between a rather large man and a smaller asian girls, and I was scared I was going to flip out. I attempted to sleep it off, but my body kept violently jerking me awake as some type of reflex. In Switzerland, I was travelling down a gondola in the middle of a fairly intense snowstorm (enough that I couldn't see out the windows) and by the time I got to the bottom I was not a happy camper...felt quite nauseous. I discovered another phobia of mine, but I'm not quite sure the word for it so I'll have to cram two phobias I do know into one..I call it: agoracousticophobia, the fear of the noise of large crowds. I was sitting at dinner in Earls today, and sitting at my table, listening to the cacophony of people and cars and dishes rattling and the like was steadily making me more and more uncomfortable. I wouldn't say that I was physically afraid, but I could feel flight or fight impulses taking over. My ears were becoming very sensitive to the near-randomness of the conversations drifting in and out of earshot. Likewise with walking down Robson St. in Vancouver. I'm almost forced to shut off my brain temporarily and drift on automatic, focussing on some deep down need to get home to the quiet.   Thankfully, I do have an explanation for this fear. I have one regularly occuring dream that continues to haunt me. I am in a large dark cavern-like place. I hear what sounds like a ball rolling towards me. The rolling sound becomes louder and louder and the cavern I am in becomes smaller and smaller. The closer the sound gets, the worse it sounds; like static on a radio mixed with screams and horns and any noise you can think of. At the same time I feel the weight of whatever is approaching slowly pushing me. I fall to my knees, cover my ears with my hands and cannot block out the sounds or the feelings. I feel myself almost shrinking in response to my 'attacker'...I welcome my shrinking as I will be less likely to be crushed if I am small enough to pass by. The sound-ball/shrinking-cavern collapses on me and I wake up screaming. Disconcerting to say the least; I've had this dream many times.   Let's see what the DREAM DICTIONARY tells us:   Shrink  To dream that you are shrinking, suggests that you lack self-confidence and self-esteem. You may also feel embarrassed or unimportant in some situation. Perhaps you feel that you have been overlooked by others. Alternatively, the dream may refer to a time were you were young and small and thus symbolic of your childhood.   No one would say that I lack self-confidence or self-esteem so I'll have to scratch that one off.  Cave  To dream that you are walking in a dark cave, signifies refuge or the unconscious mind. It also denotes that you experience some unexpected misfortune or disagreement.   A little vague. Who hasn't experienced misoftune or disagreement?  Noise  To hear a strange noise in your dream, signifies the unexpected and the unknown. You may be expressing some fear or confusion concerning a particular situation in your waking life. The noise in your dream may serve as a way to attract your attention to that issue. Alternatively, noise may represent a breakthrough in your personal struggles. Perhaps you have burst through a barrier of resistance which had been holding you back for a long time.   Or maybe I've watched Indiana Jones too many times :)  Darkness  To dream that darkness comes upon you, signifies failure in work you may attempt. Darkness is synonymous with ignorance, the unconscious, evil, death, and fear of the unknown. To dream that you are lost in the darkness, denotes feelings of desperation, depression, or insecurity.   No dream dictionaries have anything with regards to being crushed...very disappointing :(   So, now that you know what you fear, how do you conquer those fears? Or should I save those for another day?
