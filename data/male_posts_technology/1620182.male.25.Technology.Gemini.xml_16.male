I tried to take it in stride, but it's hard to not take things personally when you have a group of ten people spitting at the result of two years of hard work.  I think I did okay.  I joked; I joined in the bashing.  I think my ego may be bruised, though.  How can I tell if my ego is bruised?  Am I going to turn purple somewhere?  You know what the best part is?  We have two more scheduled ego-bruising sessions on the horizon...I can't wait.  In the meantime, I plan on taking my car to be serviced and then it's home to continue my packing / apartment search.
