The hair that curls up underneath the brim dwarfs the hat and makes “My Big Ted Kennedy Head” look even more mellony.    The Disappoint (of the mighty beast known as Anger and Disappointment) is beginning to creep into my soul as day three of phase two in the Great Smoke Out wears on. I am disappointed in my anger (as opposed to angered by my disappointment.)    Our friend MSN messenger records:  Dave, David, Dutch says: what are you up to?  Lisa says: i'm learning how to make shoelaces  Dave, David, Dutch says: haha  Lisa says: Just taking care of random stuff.  And waiting for Sergei.  Dave, David, Dutch says: that's interesting, but i ment butt count  Dave, David, Dutch says: how many squares you done smoked today?  Lisa says: oh, i'm a dumbass  Lisa says: we've both had 3  Dave, David, Dutch says: alright fuck it, record this:  #4 1:18 pm      Which found our hero sitting on the stoop smoldering once again, smoking number four out ten allotted cigarettes on the day.  Lisa and I have been keeping a log of the times we smoke with little notations in the margin, “c” for example to denote that the cigarette in question was smoked in the car.  In this manor we hope to identify potential stumbling blocks in the daily grind.    A note I might make in the future would be an “s” to signify that Stu, trouncing me in Ping Pong a record 5 matches helped exacerbate my current state of Disappointment.  But no, I’d hate to admit that Stuart drove me to number 4 today.
