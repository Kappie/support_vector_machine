     
      You can tell I spend more time in the office than doing real hard work!  Yesterday was spent finishing taking the old patio up, and to day I'm aching all over, and my hands look like I've put them through a shredder - deep joy!  Now, back to work to catch up with everything I missed whilst on the course last week - and to do revision for the exam in a few weeks - its all go go go.
