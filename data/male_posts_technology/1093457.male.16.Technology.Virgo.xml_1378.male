Oh yea because on Monday I have General Studies exam and I have 2 essays to do for Mr Hogg and then Wednesday and Thursday 2 day art exam. Ahhhhhhhhhhh. No wait. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. That's better. *grins* So breifly my exam, well, I am kinda pleased. Its ok, not how I wanted it because Connelly interfered and made me change some so grrr. I actually walked out of exam. Came back about 20 minutes later and just did what she said even though I disagreed. She does mark it afterall. But the less said about that the better.  Um what else. Working today 9.30 til 1.30. I believe you have weekend off Jackie? If so have fun. Um, when I get in just doing essays and art and textiles work. Woo. Fun hey. And geology if I can fit it in. Tomorrow working 10.00 til 2.00 I think so yea GAH. Get home and back to homework straight away. On Monday we have General Studies. Anyone know details for that?? I know I am doing Science paper.Er...Monday evening I'm going to see The Passion Of The Christ as hinted at by Starky as I am doing that in Art. I think Paul is coming but he is still deciding. Um. Yea and that is as far as I am thinking ahead.   Have a good weekend ya'll. :p
