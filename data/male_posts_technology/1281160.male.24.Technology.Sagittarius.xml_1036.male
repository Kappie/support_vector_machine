Do away with the CAT, GD and Personal interviews... After all higher education cannot be the choice of just the intellectual few... Every Tom, Dick and Harry has an equal say to it... And since CAT, GD, and the Personal interviews were separating the elitist from the non-elitist, they have to be discarded...  2. Introduce a new quota for the kith and kin of Government employees... they are the most underprivileged of the lot...  3. Decide the curriculum... Mr.Joshi being a Ph.D. himself... who better a person to decide the curriculum than the erudite Dr.Joshiâ€¦  4. Day-1 companies during campus interviews should be the PSUs... and there need to be a rule that the top 50 brains in the IIMs should necessarily stay in PSUs... after all, isn't the country losing the best brains to the MNCs..
