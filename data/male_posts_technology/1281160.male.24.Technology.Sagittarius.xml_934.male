Probably not. This is why I say the IIT model is aging. It is a fact that the IITs have not really kept up with the times........  ...........But as far as I know, not a single IIT has a well regarded program in any of the great new frontiers of technology, in particular in biotechnology. Nor in nanotechnology, in new power technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells, in any cutting edge area, really. Why is this? One reason is that they are insulated from the market, as they are guaranteed a Rs 75 crore grant from the government every year.
