Yes, the film was excellent, I too would like a sequal and I would like to be a vampire. I already have the eyes. Mwhahaha. 3 weeks at Sixth Form. Good bad? I'd say good. Its going well for me. I am really knackered this week from sixth form and work. Whenever I stay up late doing homework or something I have to get up early and never get a chance for a lay in. Right now I am aching so bad. :(  Have a nice weekend everyone.
