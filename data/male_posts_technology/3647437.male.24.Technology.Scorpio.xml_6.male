Wait staff get paid in tips only but it can be an excellent way to make a living depending on the clientele.  We watched Fahrenheit 9/11 in Times Square then caught the subway to Brooklyn where I had a home cooked dinner, drank too much beer and talked into the wee small hours.  Funny how comfy couches can be when you’re wasted.  Unfortunately this heat does not lend itself to sleep and the Kellies building swayed in a disconcerting fashion with each subway train as it passed in the night.    Brooklyn is grimier than the maintained cityscape of midtown Manhattan.  Glad I saw a real apartment though and savored the new surroundings.  – I’m feeling like I’ve seen a good portion of the city now but there is soo much I still haven’t seen - I’ll have to come back I think.  This afternoon I’m meeting Mims, Julia and James.  I’m getting a car organized and will do battle with a Laundromat!  Having an admin day and I hope time for a sleep.    Will post some more NY photos but my next update will be from the road I hope.  Not looking forward to negotiating NY streets in a rental car but if it doesn’t kill you then it must be good for you, or so they say.
