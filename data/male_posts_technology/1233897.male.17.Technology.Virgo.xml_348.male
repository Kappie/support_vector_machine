It's great for people like me and Steven... Though better for him than 'cause of his Pocket PC. Later I'll see about browsing their network, but I'm quite content now using it to simply connect to the web and get removal tools for whatever varient of Mydoom happens to be afflicting the laptop. Let their network get infected, not mine. *evil grin* ;) [/Edit]
