One love, we get to share it  Leaves you baby if you don't care for it.  Did I disappoint you or leave a bad taste in your mouth? You act like you never had love and you want me to go without. Well, it's too late tonight to drag the past out into the light. We're one, but we're not the same. We get to carry each other, carry each other... one  Have you come here for forgiveness,  Have you come to raise the dead Have you come here to play Jesus to the lepers in your head Did I ask too much, more than a lot You gave me nothing, now it's all I got. We're one, but we're not the same. Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again.  You say love is a temple, love a higher law Love is a temple, love the higher law. You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl And I can't be holding on to what you got, when all you got is hurt.  One love, one blood, one life, you got to do what you should. One life with each other: sisters, brothers. One life, but we're not the same. We get to carry each other, carry each other. One, one.  - Bono
