The report firmly lays the blame on electronic media for luring readers away from paper and ink. The primary contention of the report is that Americans are suffering from a form of cultural ADD or are just too lazy to invest time and effort in the act of reading. I challenge the contention that all of the blame rests with the readers. As with any consumer product, the use of the product is in direct proportion to the consumers perception of the quality of the product. While the creation of literature is art, the reading of literature is essentially an act of consumption; and time is the medium of exchange in the marketplace of entertainment.   While the rate at which Americans read literature dropped 7 percentage points in the decade from 1992 to 2002 (double the rate of decline when compared with the decade from 1982 to 1992), the rate of decline in overall book readership remained fairly level (about 3 to 4 percentage points). Admittedly the decline in overall readership is due to the rise of electronic media, but there is a larger question. Why is literature losing market share when compared to other books? The memoirs of various public figures and other non-fiction works from Chicken Soup for the series to the works of the Dalai Lama have overshadowed almost all other publishing with the exception of Harry Potter. So, why are readers choosing to spend their time (capital) to read non-fiction instead of literature? Quality.   Any time a written work is transformed into a film or book on tape elements of the original work are lost. In the past, the perception of the quality of the literary experience was such that most readers believed the electronic version of literature to be inferior; that it lacked an important level of detail when compared with the original work. As the decline in literature readership suggests, this perception is changing. It appears that the perception of the quality of the literary experience has declined to the extent that consumers consider the electronic version of the original work to be "good enough" and so, spend their reading capital on other works.   "I'll wait for the movie," a phrase that was once a joke, has become a fact for most Americans.  (For example, most people have seen far more Michael Crichton or John Grisham movies than have read the origal novel.)  The real challenge for those concerned in increasing literary readership is one of marketing.  Literature is both art and product; and if you want Americans to read more literature, you have to increase demand for the product.  To increase that demand, you have to improve the consumer's perception of the quality of the product.  By overstating it's case, the NEA has given fuel to critics that claim the agency is out of touch with mainstream America.  By citing dubious correlations as evidence of direct causality, the credibility of the report is compromised.  By choosing to bemoan Americans as a bunch of e-media addicts instead of examining the causes of the decline in literary readership and the need to improve American appreciation for literature, and the arts in general, the NEA reinforces it's reputation as cerebus of the artistically elitist status quo.  Unfortunately, the NEA report makes poor reading for all the wrong reasons.
