I've modded some things, added some things, deleted some things.    About Macs: I've been thinking very hard about mac or windows.  And I've been reading  urlLink Mr. Hall's  blog.  It seems as tho there are many, many new and wonderful innovations that will be introduced into OS X and Tiger within the next year (more than a full year ahead of Longhorn).  One of the biggest things I want to use is Safari RSS.  I think the RSS searching feature will be s00per cool, and will provide a very easy way to keep up with all the crap I'm to lazy to.  I was talking to  urlLink Mike  earlier about Safari, and he said that it was interesting that I wanted to use Safari RSS and I had never used Mac before.  hehe, shows you how much Apple is getting to me.  Another thing that was  urlLink thrown around  was the possibility of a dual 64-bit windows system being capable of competing with a dual G5.  I personally like the idea of being able to stick with windows, because of familiarity and the software compatibility.  But at the same time I really want a change, and don't all designers use a Mac?  :)  It's raining very hard across the middle U.S., from OK to east TN.  And I burned my tongue.    I have four Gmail invitations for anyone who has not received one yet, or would like to try the service out.  You may email me  urlLink here  with your full name and email address.  It's been so long since I've done any personal design work.  And that's probably because Photoshop is broken on my home computer.  Bummer.    Everyone have a safe, happy 4th of July, and check out my  urlLink work desktop  and my  urlLink home desktop .  Screen manicure for BB tomorrow night!  Whoopie!  peace out
