In the midst of confusion I am finding redemption.  ...and in the most unlikely of places. Genesis 4:17 states "Cain knew his wife; and she conceived". During YMCL tonight, it was once again brought to my attention that maybe Adam  Eve weren't the first people on earth. Maybe what they spoke on in English Lit II was correct, that there was a civilization that predates the Bible by 2,000 years (see the story of Gilgamesh). The obvious speculation that the average reader would draw from the passage is that originally, inbreeding from the seeds of Adam  Eve bore the children of the world. Well, one step i've taken in the learning process is i've finally determined that there were people on earth before them, a civilization created that mingled then with this man that God created. These are words i've heard from men of the gospel themselves. What i'm also, and have been aware of from the beginning, aware of is that it takes a strong man of God whose revelations in the word has been directly granted him by the spirit to truly be able to explain this passage to me. I have yet to meet this individual but my spiritual eyes are open and watching. Everyone has questions, yet I dispute not the word. I dare not defy the Word, the works  the will of God but to seek a firmer understanding so that for myself I might know, and for others who may desire similar info...  They talked about the first chapter of proverbs, and of its author King Solomon. Son of David, deemed the wisest man on earth according to the Bible. But this man Solomon, he created according to the word, thousands of proverbs, most of which were gathered together and completely presented in its current form circa 200 B.C. We discussed towards the end the roles of women in the home...a subject that branched out to all persons of duty. Examined a parallel between whom the word was given to and how modern society has fooled itself into a religious liberal freefall that, governed by the mandate of men, has strayed far away from the Word of God!  Whoa...  So post dream trauma talking, perhaps, but i'm truly not afraid to die. I'm aware that the only thing that could live on forever is my legacy. Once I die, what will be left behind? Will there be a world after my exit from this place? Would my passing be one of the last such that, the days of mankind are not long that they should have time to pass my revelations  knowledge down to their sons  daughters? One thing i've definitely learned so far this year is that I cannot control anything but my own fate. Despite the movements of other people, I have to run my own race. Move according to the will  testament that God emparts upon my heart. My love for research has often led me down numerous paths. Lately, it has revealed to me that both Bush  Kerry are members of the  urlLink Skulls organization , infamous secret society / death cult. Great knowledge, I guess...just what I was looking to hear for a man who's desperate to believe there's still some good in the American society...  Last thing I will say before I go is on one of my  urlLink yahoo profiles, I have a quote that says "Experience is a hard teacher because she gives the test first, the lesson afterwards". Ron J is by no means a finished product but I am striving daily to defeat temptation and be a suitable instrument for the Lord! Not just any instrument, but a great instrument...one that is set apart from the rest and viewed as the standard of godly perfection!  What are your goals?
