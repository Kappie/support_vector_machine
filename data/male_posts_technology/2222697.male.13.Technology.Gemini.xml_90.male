Luciferian also had a short sentence about the forum, now I know it will never die. Forums only die because the owners give up on them, but heck I have a pretty good attention span when it comes to these things. Joe has to be one of the coolest people I've met, he actually has a weblog, and he isn't a jerk ^^ I have obviously had a weblog longer than him he started mother's day.  I bought an airsoft gun with a very small portion of my b-day money. It is a shotgun and I already got in trouble for shooting the neighbors ^_^. ne ways no harm done. The thing has great accuracy and I can hit a pole 30 feet away. I saw harrison at academy when me and Ben where buying ours. Harry got an uzi and it is the coolest ever. He was unloading out the car window near mailboxes >  Total, today I got $17Ø.ØØ minus the gun and I have about $125. I will get more and I will end up with about 200% more than anyone I know is bringing, I am buying them all something (under 3 bucks hopefully)... Part of it is guilt and some of it is generosity, I am not short on cash and some of them are, I think Harrison has 4 dollars.  Oh well. I want to say thanx to shelby for the 13$ I will send it back to you on ur b-day!  ^_^ Elad out
