You can find his M$ funded and puppeted institute  urlLink here . Anyway....Brown writes a very uninspiring peice accusing Linus of "stealing" a majority of code from Andy Tanenbaum's Minix OS. In the end all the major open source playas (torvalds, tanenbaum, and raymond) got to take their respective shots at this M$ sock-puppet Ken Brown and the shit rag he wrote.  I will provide the links to all rebutles of Brown's paper b/c the links on the ADTI site are mysteriously unavailable. See  urlLink here.  And they are far more eloquent at tearing Brown apart than I could do justice.  Here are all the comments, hopefully in order   urlLink Linus Torvalds   urlLink Andy Tanenbaum   urlLink Eric Raymond -this is priceless!  While Brown's paper "Samizdat" is an obvious jab at the open-source movement (and a troll and major flambait and outright disregard for veritas), even before it's public release, it has prompted a wave of concern in the Open community in regards to the auditing of source/kernel changes and who is responsible. New measures have already been instituted to ensure that developers "sign off" on code they have worked on or reviewed.  FUD is still the reason most Open projects have no place yet in corporate IT environments. When will managers wake up and realize that behind all the pagentry and propaganda at M$, there is nothing but subpar programming/development, smoke, and mirrors. And while we are on the topic of "borrowing" code, M$ is responsible for some of the greatest borrowing of all time, like Berkely's TCP/IP stack. Also, I would like to point out that Windows-centric environments with all there helping-hand config wizards creates the "i dunno it just works that way" attitude. This inturn creates a generation of "dumb" sysadmins...and you wonder why 18 yo. kids can take down these companies with 200 lines of code. How's that for FUD.
