I think I've been burning the candle at both ends for too long and it's finally catching up with me. I need some relax and chill time with people, if only just to talk about my feelings. OR maybe I just need a good nights sleep and then I won't have these lonely feelings anymore.  Who knows? Peace out- Tim
