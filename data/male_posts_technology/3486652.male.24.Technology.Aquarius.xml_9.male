First impressions show more updates to the same UI layout we know from Norton Antivirus 2003 and 2004. A new addition would be the 'Feature Deactivation Alert' yet another process in the background running, as if we need them!  Anyway if tracking the newest popular software is your thing feast your eyes on the screenshots of the product that will most likely be available (as with earlier versions) to public test soon.
