His name was Colm - straight (more like gay) from Dublin! From the first moment we shook hands, I felt a new type of warmth flow through me. No, it wasn't pure lust, it was something much deeper. We enjoyed the party, and then said good night. The next day, while working on the network, I received a phone call from, yes, you guessed it, COLM! He wanted to thank me for last night and that he wanted to have dinner. And the rest, they say, is history!  And now, we have begun our new life together. He has moved in with me and we are enjoying each other immensely. Life is awesomely amazing!  Peace!
