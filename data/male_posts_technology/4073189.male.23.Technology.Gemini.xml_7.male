Sprained my left foot for the xxx times... sprain until I can't remember how many times i sprain my foot... Ouch~!! Went to see the camp's medical officer and he just send me for an X-tray... And what about my leg? Can't even walk how? Wah Kau!!! Looks like have spent money to see a private doctor liao...  On the bright side, I can leave that xxx camp earlier... Ho Ho Ho  After my X-ray at Jurong East, I went to Cash Convertor (Retail used goods) and buy some DVDs. When I went there, I was so lucky to be served by a kawaii sale attendance! Sweet looking girl around my age... In the end, bought Eraser DVD1 = $12, Boys de DVD = $8 and a japanese movie VCD = $2.   Time:   1310hrs   State of Condition:   Delighted   Reached home and found out not only the Eraser DVD is code 1 , and its double sided... One side is widescreen edition and the other is 4:3 standard TV! Super good deal...  Finishing today's stuff and Zzzzz....        ORD countdown:   74 days   Why is there a timer for my ORD?   NS is a waste of time…And I serve 16mths with a rank of CPL…
