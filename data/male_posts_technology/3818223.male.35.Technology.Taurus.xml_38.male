This book also features heavy doses of nostalgia (set in and around a drive-in theatre in 1958) and mystery. Warning - not for mystery lovers who like a story that neatly solves itself in the end. Lansdale tends to lean toward reality, where every problem does not have an accessible solution.  - 4.5 out of 5 stars
