Heard that when u dream of something, reality always turn out the opposite way...wah!! dont know true or not...den if let me choose, i rather not have this dream at all. Maybe think too much lor then dream of her, theres a saying like "Ri you suo si, ye you suo meng"....  Now become her alarm clock liow. Every morning give her morning call cos she been late for work lately. dun know wats bothering her also. Think she too used to sleeping late then got this problem of inability of waking up early in the morning. Met her last sat and found out she had been sick for quite sometime liow, sore throat and cough and runny nose. she looks so sick and tired lor....dark eye ring also very visible. can see she have not been sleeping well for the past few weeks. haiz...... if i can i rather let her take sleeping pills or worst force her to sleep early as i know she wont one. she would rather watch tv or pack her accessories or clothings.... but now i am obligated to give her morning call every morning i also happy..... cos would get to hear her sleepy voice every morning realli makes my day haha.....too obsessed liow.... well at least happy for a while lor.....can someone get me out of this?? jiu jiu wo bah!!! being happy of becoming an alarm clock also happy....i think i need a shrink liow.....anyone can intro one to me??  cheers, Teddy
