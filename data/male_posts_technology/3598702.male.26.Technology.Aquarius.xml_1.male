They had talked over the internet for a long time before that, and Marlow was pretty sure that he wouldn't eat humu fish.  The humu fish jumped out of her tank and gave marlow a hug, a wet sloppy fishy hug but marlow loved it.  He had never been hugged by a fish before.  He knew that coming to Kansas was one of the best things that he has done.  It's been almost a week since Marlow has seen the humu fish, and he was missing her terribly.  He went back home and meowed... and meowed... and said meow many more times till Domino (his cat roomate that hates him) jumped off the couch and tried to hit Marlow with his cat claws.  Marlow didn't care tho, he just wanted to see the humu fish again.  In his kitty mind he had planned out the things they could do if she was here.. they would go to the ocean and walk/swim in the surf.  Sand would get inbetween Marlow's claws and in his fur but it would be so great.  Humu fish could swim till she was tired then Marlow would gently take her to the Motel room and place her in her tank.  Later that night they would go out to eat at a resturant that serves no seafood... Humu fish likes to catch her own fish to eat, she doesn't like the idea that a fisherman threw nets down and grabbed her prey like kelp.  Marlow remembers his trips to the beach, all 27 of them.  He thinks of his favorite places to go, then he imagines the Humu fish next to him.  He is allowed to do this since he has met her in real life.  It doesn't mean she is really next to him, or that he is even at the beach.  He is sitting alone in his house, looking out the window, Meowing at the grass covered in water mist and gently whispered to by the wind.
