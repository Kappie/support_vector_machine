If I draw over to one side, what good am I doing?  On Friday, I got off work early before lunch, and drove Trung and Loren (coworkers) around town, from PCC Sylvania all the way over to Wilsonville, and back to several other places. We kept taking back roads at Trung’s direction and getting lost :). After several hours of this, I finally dropped them off at Tony’s house and went back to mine to get ready for the mini-concert at our church later. I dropped by Gwen’s work on the way over to church and finally saw her after she got back from the trip. She didn’t want to take a break, so she walked me out to my car, carrying my only purchased item, a 2-liter of Ginger Ale (lol).   I finally got to church slightly past 4:30 and helped with setup. The concert officially started at 6:00, but we bumped it back an hour total, to accommodate setting the sound system up more precisely. It was really fun - Freeborn, my friend Jo’s band played. We had ramps and rails for boarding and bmx, plus a bbq and some other stuff. Katie, Kat, Melissa and Adri came. I stayed after until past 11:40, tearing down and putting stuff away.  On Sat., I went to Goody’s house for David’s surprise B-day party. Later, Goody and I got a ride to the MAX station where we met Trung, Josh, Loren, Tony, Jason, and two other people and went to the Lloyd Center to see Pirates of the Caribbean. (That’s an AWESOME movie!!! Johnny Depp’s performance was perfect, and the movie as a whole couldn’t have been done better. If you haven’t seen it yet, see it!). We saw some rather interesting people every time we got on / off the MAX: one kid was just being an idiot, cussing at everyone he saw, including old ladies and stuff. Everyone on the car started talking about him in hushed tones when he got off. Another guy is a mime that I’ve seen down at Waterfront Park before – he paints his entire body, hair, face... clothes, silver and sits motionless for hours at a time. Then there were the two... dysfunctional women... who got into a fight on the tracks at the Lloyd Center Station and stopped a train. Then, they seemed content with hurling both insults and physical objects at each other from across the station until another train arrived, and one got on. Then, the other woman would occasionally get up and start screaming and beating at unseen people seemingly following her around. ...Interesting night.  Sunday morning, COUNTRY FEST 2003!!! (well, actually it wasn’t that good) basically Trung, Loren, Josh, Jason and I drove for 2 hours out to St. Helens in two cars and spent the day tanning under the sun, listening to mind-numbingly loud country music. We were stationed more than 800 feet from the stage, and the bass woofers still shook the ground... That’s a little too much power, methinks. Later, it only took us an hour and a half to get home because we took the roads that we had completely overlooked on the way there. I was depressed the entire day after I got home. Everyone was cranky and needed a nap or something (lol).  Monday morning, work... I was still really depressed until mid afternoon, when Trung and I washed my boss’s house for two hours (lol). For some reason, it was then that I regained my vitality and joyful spirit and all. Later that evening, my parents attended a church-wide meeting at their church that would be the springboard for the church to vote whether of not to kick my mom out (In my very wise uncle’s words: “I was at the stupid meeting last night. Wished I could have been somewhere else, but I’m glad I was there to support your mom. Those people there are... CRAZY, for lack of a more demeaning term.”)  Today, I got to work late since my room wasn’t clean, and my parent’s new punishment to obsess with is not letting me drive anywhere. They are going to start using that as recklessly as they confiscated my Xbox back in Feb. They kept adding on and on time till I could have it back, until as of now, I am entitled to have it back sometime next Spring (though I just decided to go and take it out of their room two weeks ago, and either they haven’t noticed it yet, or they’re trying to act like they don’t care.  My mom and I went out to lunch today (she picked me up from work), and we had a long talk about every topic ranging from Gwen, to work, to school next year, to the meeting last night at her church. I love my mom; she’s so easy to talk to. :)  Today, I went up to Gwen’s house at about 8:15pm and didn’t get back down until almost 10:20. While I was up there she made some random comment about how long my hair was, and within ten minutes she was giving me a haircut (lol). I need to take a picture of myself now, I’m all buzzed. My foot's sore from kicking her punching bag for like, 20 minutes.   Tomorrow, I’m letting Trung borrow my Xbox and I’m borrowing his PS2 for ...a week I think.  Well, goodnight everyone, and may God watch over your sleep.
