Congratulations!!!!    *grinning sheepishly*  ... thats the only prize I can give!! :p  Ok ... now on to other things...  i.e.  the definition of happiness!!  I had invited you all to define happiness... and some of you did so in the comments box...  see below for the blog dated 10th November 2002 .... Now it is my turn!  According to me life is like a journey through a dark night. You can't see much further up the road, so you stumble along the path towards the final destination. Sometimes... along comes a firefly, flitting around you, glowing as it buzzes around you... a tiny speck of light in the pitch black expanse of the night! You reach out and clasp your palms gently around the firefly and bring your hands closer to your face... then slowly open the hands. The tiny glow of the firefly lights up your face!!   The firefly fleeting around you, is a moment of happiness! It is upto you to gently grasp it and enjoy the moment when it lights up your face. Then... the glow dies down and the world is pitch black again! You must continue your journey with the memories of the moments of happiness that touched your life.  A wise man knows that he should not stand on the path, hoping for the firefly to glow again or thinking too much about the beauty of the moment that passed. He knows that fireflies abound along the path of life. One has only to keep a lookout for them and when one is spotted... enjoy the moment and continue walking!   Happiness is a drink best enjoyed in small sips!!   Hee hee!! ... I hope that was not too philosophical!!! ;-)  So... don't worry... be happy!!  cheers!!
