I was thinking last night.. or into the wee hours of this morning, about something that I thought might enrich your lives a little, that you may learn, from where I have stepped, and choose your own steps more confidently because of that. Read that as 'learn from the old man' :D  A few years back, when I was dressed all in black,  my hair cut long my chin shaved short,  and still at uni, being taught, I met a girl, we got on well, lots of blushing - both shy as hell.  We met online, and talked each night, Then moved to telephone, when the time was right, She had an accent, and had a tan (and a tidy figure - hey! I'm still a man) She was smart and witty, undeniably cute, We got along well, and she liked me to boot.  We started to meet, together in town, We'd go shopping for toys. Weeks with no frown. Things were all smiley, so I asked her out, She finally said yes when I started to pout.  Valentines day started to near, But a friend had a 21st that I wanted to share, They say love is blind, so following that, I left the party early, like a right fucken prat. Got back to auckland, to meet up with her, heart bracelet in hand, to add to alure  Hand made a picnic, to later have on the sand, rollerblading in mission bay, I pictured us hand in hand. dinner at a restaurant, to view setting sun All efforts made, because she was the one.  About to depart, the phone calls to me, I answer, we talk, but she couldnt see, Why cancelling was a big thing, a big thing for me. The busses she said, meant we'd have little time, so was there much point? I simply said 'fine' I hung up the phone, and sat still for a while. No tears. no warmth. no date. no smile.  -end-  The moral of the story? well folks.. before you go putting a lot of time and effort into organising something for someone, make sure they're worth it.. the person that comes across as being a little selfish - probably is. And to this day I think I'd have better spent my time, with my oldest and dearest friend, at his 21st, than chasing skirt. Bro's before Hoes nig-GUH!  cu :D
