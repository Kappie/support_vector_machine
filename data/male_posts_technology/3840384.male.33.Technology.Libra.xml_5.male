I mean, its not like I am going to say anything that I wasn't going to say anyway. I do know one person who was reading it though. Someone named "MaryAnn" replied to a posting. But she is anonymous so I really do not know who she might be (the only Maryann I know is allergic to the internet, so I doubt its her). If this new MaryAnn is sane and rational she probably gave up on this blog already? :)  Maryann, if you are still reading, I hope I have not bored you out of this blog....  Anyway, yesterday at work someone wrote about a process that I am planning to write some code to try and automate. But I was struck by how much of what she wrote was what I was already thinking about but had not yet captured in the spec, since its just a spec. I think that means we are on the same wavelength, which may come in handy if I have problems later (shes not a software developer but she is familiar with the process so she may be able to break a conceptual logjam).   Sometimes I think that I could really use someone like that in my personal life. But then when I think back to past relationships I'm not so sure... it seems like relationships are usually more succcessful when they are more complementary (and overlap less). If you can finish each others' sentences then you probably did not even need to say it in the first place, right? Thats a sure way to end a relationhip when you don't feel like someone is adding new thoughts and ideas to the situation.
