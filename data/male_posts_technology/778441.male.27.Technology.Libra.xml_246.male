Are these PETA people serious?? Or has advocating too much of veggies turned these people into vegetables, incapable of thought!  People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals says the name Hamburg conjures up images of slaughtered cows and unhealthy meals.  Really??! So, what would they like the towns to be named instead?... Cabbageville??... or perhaps Broccoliburg??!  Idiots!! [link via  urlLink Metafilter ]
