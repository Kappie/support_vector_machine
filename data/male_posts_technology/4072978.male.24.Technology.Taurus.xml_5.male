As you can imagine I was extremely tired after staying awake so long. I was at home and sitting in the family room on the couch when I just crashed and fell asleep... and then the dream begun.  It wasn't unusual at all except for the small fact everyone in my dream spOKe in numbers. It was ok though, because I could understand and communicate with them with a simple algorithm I could do in my head. It was cool. Except, then my dad woke me up in the waking world.....  I woke up, and I WAS awake I am sure of it. Except one problem, whatever my dad was saying, I could only hear it numbers! The worst part about it was I forgot the algorithm oh that and I was hearing him speak numbers in the first place.... Apparently he wanted me to do something because he started yelling at me when I just kept staring at him trying to figure out if I was awake or not! So I left the family room and went to find something else to do. Fortunately after a couple minutes the numbers started turning into words again and every few words there would only be a few numbers, until everything was back to normal again.  My dream actually crossed over into the waking rule for a substantial period of time!  The mind is amazing isn't it?
