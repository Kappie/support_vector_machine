Dan and Michelle's for dinner  I did not as the heading suggests eat Dan and Michelle's house. However I did attend a dinner at Dan and Michelle's house. And a very good cook is Michelle. She made hamburgers, and potato wedges. Very yumy. Me and Dan got to a lot of interesting talking. The results of which will probably be published on one or both of our blogs in the near future. Watch out!
