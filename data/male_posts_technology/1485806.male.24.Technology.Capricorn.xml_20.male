And even in Amcorp Starbucks...I am truly in awe of the things..situation...people...and everything God have planned for me...and everyone else...I mean even He endowed with all His Power to me like Bruce Almighty....I would not have the wisdom to arrange all this and words cannot truly ....express it...  Everything that i have laid down, my life, my careers, my accomodation...at the cross and really believe it by faith...I claim that promise everyday that God is going to do with my life...I just have to sit back and really pray about it... And suddenly....there is that peace, quietness and calmness in that heart that everything works out for the good for those who loved Him. He will lead us to quiet waters and green pastures...only if we let Him.  Accomodation recommended by Auntie Cecillia( for those who doesn't know Wai Nyan 's mom) (Ps: Hope i got the spelling correct....) , Graduate training scheme approved , along with several job offers that i have to turn down....all coming down like manna from Heaven...and what do i do ?  All i can do is just reach out my hand to heaven, and start praising God and worship Him...to me...it is not just the blessings but the response from God lifts up my faith...  SO want to encourage you guys,,,if your plans are not going well, it might be that your plans are not right before God and you are not right before God...so take your time...to spend time with Him and offer your plans before Him...   I was reading God in the Lord of the Rings that day where Tolkien's and C.S Lewis 's translation of the Lord Of The Rings and what message is Tolkien trying to bring in the Lord Of the Rings is truly amazing.. Even in the coming Return Of The  Kings....signify the return of the King that will redeem everyone...and restore the ruins that the evil one have done , to its former glory , even more magnificent than the former. It speaks of Jesus, coming back to redeems Us vanquishing the Ring... The Ring is sin, which all of us are bound by it , deceived and seduced to possess it by whatever means we have.... The Act of Frodo trying to bear the ring's burden, consumed by its evil....but still take it to Mount Doom to destroy it speaks of sacrifice...speaks of Jesus...  Frodo brought the ring's evil upon himself ..suffered through and well....i shall not reveal the ending of LOTR : Return of the King to you...or i shall get stoned later.
