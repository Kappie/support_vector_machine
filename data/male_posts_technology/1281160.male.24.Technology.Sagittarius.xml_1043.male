It is been a couple of weeks since I posted some laws. So consider this as a continuation from where I left off.  So  urlLink Friday the Thirteenth . And Tomorrow is  urlLink Saturday the Fourteenth .  urlLink Valentine 's day. Wonderful.  I am looking out for new designs for this blog and  urlLink QSS . Anyone having any good color schemes, send them to me. BTW, does anyone else use a RSS reader?
