Even better, the letter had stamps which said Mexico, and a postmark which said Cuernavaca!  Inside I found a birthday card, a "Sinceramente Hallmark" birthday card.  Now to head off any confusion, my birthday WAS in fact a number of months ago, and apparently that is when this card was mailed.  The postal service between here and Mexico is not terribly prompt however and it seems that my card had been sitting in the Cuernavaca post station until they finally shipped it out on the 7th of July.  Despite all that, I was grinning like the Cheshire cat when I opened the card.  It came from a cool girl I met in Mexico named Nina.  She is a chef from Norway and taught me a wonderful recipe for salmon.  I like cooking a lot, but even better is learning new tricks from someone who knows how to cook well, so cooking with Nina was quite a treat. Here is the salmon recipe: It is best to start with the sauce because it takes a long time to simmer.  It is very simple to make, just put some cream (of about whipping cream thickness) into a smallish sauce-pan.  Stir in dijon mustard (I use the normal kind, but the honey type might be good too?) until the mixture turns a little yellow.  Heat it until it is boiling a little bit, and keep adding mustard if it isn't as strong as you'd like it.  Adding some sugar is also not a bad idea.  When the sauce has boiled down to the point that it is sort of thick, especially if allowed to cool in a spoon, it is done.  Put some dried dill in it at the very end, and maybe half a cube of fish bullion if you can find it. (Experimentation and tasting frequently is key here). Once the sauce is going, slice up an onion or two, and maybe some garlic etc.  Put these in a big pot full of water, and add a few fish bullion cubes (maybe impossible to get in Idaho, so I use vegetable ones instead).  Bring this to a boil, and meanwhile cut your fillet of salmon into nice serving sized steaks (wash it well, but leave the scales on).  Once the water is boiling turn the heat off (yes I'm sure), and dump the steaks in.  They will cook quite quickly in the hot water, so check them every few minutes.  Once they split very easily with a fork they are done.  Don't overcook them or they will flake apart and you will have fish soup. Serve the fish and the sauce with a nice salad and some noodles.  For those extra-special occasions a bottle of wine goes well with this combination.  Of course, we had it with copious amount of chips and home-made-guacamole in Mexico ;)  Viva el aguacate, ajo y cebolla!
