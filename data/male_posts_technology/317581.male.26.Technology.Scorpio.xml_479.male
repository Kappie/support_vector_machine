I feel and judge and seem cold and uncaring.  "Indeed, because of their strong ability to take into themselves the feelings of others, Counselors can be hurt rather easily by those around them, which, perhaps, is one reason why they tend to be private people, mutely withdrawing from human contact"  Sometimes, I get overwhelmed by the beauty of the world and I retreat. Please forgive me.  In other news, I love my job. Peace-
