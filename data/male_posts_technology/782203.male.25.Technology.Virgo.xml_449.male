I mean what the hell , am I some kind of native or something !! I am an employee of   here, at the very least I deserve a 4 and a half star hotel. The hotel sucked, the chicks there were not as hot; the pool was as small as my dick (which means its really really small); and worse of all there was no free porn on tv! Hell you would think that for 100 US Dollars a night that would be at least some basic porn available but no!   Anyway I was so busy that I didn't have much time to go out also, stayed in the hotel room half the time while the other half I was at the institute doing work stuff. Went to this nearby shopping mall for a quick dinner that was it. It was really huge though , much bigger than anything we have in Singapore. I bought a wallet that was it.   But the people there were really nice and the local cuisine for the most part was amazing, throughly enjoyed it. Especially the steaks.  My colleague did ask me to delay my flight to Sunday and tour bangkok with him, but I was going out with a friend today so I couldn't go. But when I came back last night she cancelled on me. So now stuck at home on V day; oh well that's how it is every year ..sniff...all the stallion wants is to be loved is that so wrong !
