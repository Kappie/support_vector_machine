First off I don't get proper instructions for a Job I woke up at 8 in the morning for, then I have huge problems getting a 80 gig file copy going (yes I am watching 80 gigs copy and paste today)  Now to top if off a package that was meant to be delivered last week by fedex had a bloody wrong address. I send bubbles out (in a TAXI to Santry no less) to get it delivered to the right address because they can't do a change of address till tonight and after he arrives (he checked on the phone first to make sure he could get it today) they tell him it is probably in the van and won't be here to 5.30 tonight.. This is WAY after when I need to get it to my customer..  GAH!!!!!!!  Why does the world hate me so today? EH EH EH?
