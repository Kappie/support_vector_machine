Since, if we accept this statement is true, it would involve a contradiction whereby the speaker has refrained from lying on at least this one occasion  and  because no such contradiction is employed if the statement is false, it must be false.  Therefore this person does not always lie.  It also must be true that this person does not always tell the truth, as they have just made a false statement (a lie).  So, we can safely conclude that this person must at least sometimes tell the truth, but also has lied at least once.  Of course, there may be problems with this. If you believe there are, feel free to raise them in the comments section.
