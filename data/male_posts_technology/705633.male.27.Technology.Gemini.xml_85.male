The conversation went like this:  Me (to Custard): "What the fuck? I wasn't speeding.. probably thinks I’ve stolen the fucker.." (Policeman walks over) Policeman: "Good evening Sir. Are you aware you've been driving with your rear fog lights on?" Me: "No, sorry officer. I've only just bought this car and I’m still getting used to it" Policeman: "Best excuse I’ve heard tonight." (I find the lights and flick them off. Cop looks over my car and then at Custard and me. Driving at night with the roof off. I can see the cogs grinding.) Policeman: "Nice car. Honda, isn't it?" Me: "Yes Officer" Policeman: "Keep it waxed, don't you?" Me: "Yes, Officer" Policeman: "Goes fast, does it?" Me: "I wouldn't know Officer. I haven't taken it to France yet" (Custard starts giggling) Policeman: "Yes...well.. drive safely" Me: "Of course, Officer."
