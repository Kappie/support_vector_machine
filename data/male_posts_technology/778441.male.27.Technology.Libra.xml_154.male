If yes, then read  urlLink this  report which announces that Sprites and Elves dancing on thunder clouds have been captured by cameras on the space shuttle Columbia.  The report however quashes any hopes of finding these fantasy creatures, when it describes further, "The sprites, which are red flashes of electricity shooting up from thunderclouds 13 miles (20 km) into the ionosphere, and elves, which are glowing red doughnut shapes radiating 190 miles (300 km), were photographed Sunday by astronaut Dave Brown on the sprite hunt's first orbit."  * LOL * ... so much for fairy tales!! ;-)
