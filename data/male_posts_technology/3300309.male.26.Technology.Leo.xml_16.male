The man who shaped the childhood's of, just about, every member of  this blog, those of us who remembered computers games with 8 colours (which  clashed), those of us who remember hating that little unicorn in  Dungeons Dragons, is now committing a crime that is even worse than  The Phantom Menance.          The original star wars DVDs are coming out, they'll  be here in September I think, but they are not THE Star Wars films we remember,  they are the special editons. The stupid prick has decided that the  original versions 'do not exist' anymore. Han shooting first will never,  ever, be seen again in any official release of the films.          This disturbs me.          On other notes, I have set up the mailing list now  so when a new blog from one of us it entered, it'll notify the rest, this'll get  things going on the blog. I've added a variety of people, some have  already joined, some haven't yet the run-down is as follows with brief  introductionary comments:          Jody Armstrong     Sian Porter (comic book fan, traditional  pen/pencils artist, long suffering night owl of Q8 and associated freak  customers, Rogue fanatic [with dyed hair to boot])     Dom Fitzpatrick (fellow geek, lego fan [though  recently into Geomag])     Mark Hurn (photographer, painter,  musician,joinedwith me to dress up as a Tusken Raider in  Peterborough many years ago)      Steve 'likes the special editions' Bengree (works  at Communicaid, recently bought a wireless camera to connect his dog to his  computer, likes chick flicks and bought K-9, K-9 2 and K-9 Private Eye on DVD,  but try to see beyond flaw)     Jim Clover (part of an elite group of supergeeks,  has an original Toy Han Solo pistol, Mac fanatic)     Ewan Spence (Scottish, nutcase, runs  allaboutsymbian.com and associated empires, attempting to takeover the world by  occupying world leaders with level 31 of Vexed, available on symbian and palm  platforms amongst others)     Vicki Spence (Scottish, wife and stabilising force  in Ewan's life, mother to my goddaguther Eildth and runs her own website as well  as dabbling in photoshop to create weird and whacky images)     Eoin Foy (Irish, just got married, great optimist  and generally funny guy, needsa haircut though)     Marcus Dacombe (marketing scum, sings, plays  guitars, writes his own songs, nice guy I guess, but alas is involved with  marketing)          If anybody wants more to join, drop me their  e-mails to my usual e-mail address.          In the meantime, let's start bashing George Lucas,  it'll get things going, or we can all just ramble.          See you all later          Jody
