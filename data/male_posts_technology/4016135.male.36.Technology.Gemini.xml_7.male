It's been so long since I actually counted how many titles I have, but it has to be over 2000. I haven't stepped foot in a Blockbuster Video in something like 6 years, and I cut up my Blockbuster card years ago. Ironically, I go to very few movies in the theater. Partly because it's not possible with a baby in our lives, but also because it is so freaking expensive for two adults to go to the movies. Let's figure this out. A matinee show is $7 a ticket, so $14 for two. Then add popcorn for $4. Then a drink for $3. Maybe some candy for another $3. So two people will cost around $24. On top of that you get the privilege of getting in a car, driving to the theater, finding a parking spot and dealing with the crowds. Then during the movie, you may experience loud obnoxious people, cell phones, loud obnoxious people ON the cell phones, screaming kids, idiots who kick the back of your seat. You get the idea. Now you know why I have over 2000 DVDs. For the $24 you spend at the theater, you can buy the DVD, sit in the comfort of your own home and not worry about the BS of theaters. Of course it helps to have a home theater setup. I find that with a 50" widescreen TV, a good Dolby Digital receiver and a good progressive scan DVD player, you can pretty much approximate the good things about going to the movies.  Speaking of which, I FINALLY saw Tom Cruise's The Last Samurai. It's been one of those titles sitting in my "to watch" pile for what seems like forever. I like Tom Cruise (I feel the need. The need for speed!). I also like Japanese history and culture. So, Last Samurai is right up my alley. Very interesting movie. ALMOST too corny for its own good. I'm sure some people felt it was. It has a very romanticized view of the old world vs. the new world. What clunkiness the plot exhibited, it made up for with the spectacular cinematography. This is a BEAUTIFULLY shot film. The Japanese countryside is gorgeous and makes me want to move there and be a farmer. The whole story revolves around one man's (Cruise) journey from shattered, disillusioned Civil War "hero" to someone who discovers the harmony and beauty of life in rural Japan. It also is a portrait of Japan during the Meiiji era where the entire country struggled with its identity. On the one hand, Japan has followed the Samurai code for thousands of years. Now, it wants to join the industrial powers of the world which mean incorporating Western ideas and technology, often in direct contrast with the old ways.  So while the movie is good overall, some things bothered me. We have yet another movie set in a distant land telling the story of other cultures, yet the film centers around a white male. Once, just once, it would be nice to see a film like this center around a hero who isn't your usual white dude. You have movies like Shogun, Come See the Paradise, Thousand Pieces of Gold. Heck, even Joy Luck Club has a white guy. The white guy always gets the hot Asian girl.   Another bothersome aspect of the Last Samurai is that our hero LIVES in the end. This after enduring a massacre of a battle where he is LITERALLY the only survivor. Actually, the main Samurai lives, but good ol' Tom helps him fulfill his honor by helping the guy commit seppuku. There is no reason why Tom Cruise's character should live. It would have made a more powerful statement if he had died with everyone else at the battlefield. I can see why he lives though. His whole purpose at the end was to finally give the Emperor a clue that he's been a right bastard selling out his country. Imagine that. A white guy showing the wimpy Japanese Emperor that he's selling his soul to the white race. The end almost spoils the rest of the movie, it was so contrived.   With all the criticisms I have of the movie, I still found Last Samurai to be very entertaining. The fight scenes and the big one sided battle at the end were technically well done. Tom Cruise was believable as our hero and Ken Watanabe as the renegade Samurai is excellent. I can see why he was nominated for an Academy Award. His role was unique in that he played a very masculine, powerful Asian male. A rarity in big budget Hollywood movies. The lone female character, played by the singularly named Koyuki, is pretty much there as window dressing. No doubt she is stunningly beautiful, but she didn't do much beyond tending to Tom Cruise's wounds and looking off into the horizon with the doe-eyed look of a woman in need of a man for some sweet loving, which thankfully didn't happen. It's enough that Tom gets the respect and adoration of the natives, let alone get to sleep with the widow of a guy he impaled through the throat early in the movie. In any case, I digress. I liked the Last Samurai. Really. I did.  I give it 4 out of a possible 5 fishes.
