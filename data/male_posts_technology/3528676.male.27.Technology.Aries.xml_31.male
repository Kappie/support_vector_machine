The spunky samurai who can cut you with both her blade and her smile.  Born 15 September 1985, she is a regular magazine model and " Pop-idol ", (the japanese version of " kikay " actresses in my book.) Azumi 2 is scheduled for release in Summer 2005 and joining the cast is no other than the equally gorgeous  urlLink  Chiaki Kuriyama   of Kill Bill Vol. 1.    urlLink  Picture 1    urlLink  Picture 2    urlLink  Picture 3    urlLink  Picture 4    urlLink  Picture 5    urlLink  Picture 6    urlLink  Picture 7
