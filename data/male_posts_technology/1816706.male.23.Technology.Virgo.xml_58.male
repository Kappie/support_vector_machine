My mom picked me up from the airport and I got to go back to this tiny little shack they live in now.  Took a little nap to get back on Texas time and then me and my folks and Heather went to an Astros game.  They got their clocks cleaned, but it was still fun to go.  Afterwards I got to go get some good mexican food finally at El Tiempo.  Picked up my tux for Kennas wedding on the way there.  Hung out around the house for a little bit afterwards and then went down to Spring to hang out with all the guys down there.  It was good times and it was like I hadn't even missed a beat.
