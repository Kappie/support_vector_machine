This is the question on the minds of the sports enthusiasts in India or atleast I have that question in my mind.     Why is this dearth of sportspersons in India? What can be done to overcome this? I think many know the answers but I will put my theory in perspective.     The reason is the outlook of the parents. If I go upto my parents and tell them that I want to be a sports person their first reaction would be to discourage me and if I insisted and they have some modern outlook they will say that I can do anything as long as my studies don't get affected. Even teachers in schools tend to discourage sports naming them as a waste of time. Secondly, the government is also to blame as they are not publicising the schemes which are there which can be availed by sportspersons. Thirdly, even if the parents agree the society will discredit a person trying to reach heights in sports by saying he/she is always goofing and fit for nothing. Even though this outlook is slowly changing we still have to go a long way.    The solution to this is that the government should publicise the schemes for the sportspersons and increase them. Secondly, People should accept sport as a profession. This can happen only through awareness. The schools should promote sports. No school without a proper ground should be recognised.    I have also heard the sports people say they don't have enough facilities. This is true but they can't put up their hands and accept defeat. A true sportsperson is one who succeeds by crossing all obstacles. Take Kenya for example. The marathon runners practice cross country everyday in the heat and don't expect the government for everything.     The media should also reduce the hype on cricket and give more attention to other sports too. Only then will people take to other sports. Only then will India be a force to reckon with in the Sporting World.    Thanks for your patience and please feel free to comment.
