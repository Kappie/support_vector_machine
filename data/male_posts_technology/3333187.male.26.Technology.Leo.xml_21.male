No Bubs it's not a slang word of Brest vagina or any other female bodily orifice. She got a rabbit and the rabbit got pregnant and along came BUNNIES!!!  Now I don't sound like this often so suck up wile it's here.... They're the cutest thing I have ever seen. I mean they fit in you hand and ether try to borrow in between your finger or try to leap of your hand to the most certain death... Go fig!! Their about two weeks old and you open the pen all you see is five fuzzy asses sticking up. And their little ears are sticking up now too!! I tell yeah they make the Andrex Puppy look like a pile of puke.
