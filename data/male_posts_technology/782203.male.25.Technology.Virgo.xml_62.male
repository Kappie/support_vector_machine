So far i got 108 CDs not including my CDs pre-college (Ace of Base, Mariah Carey) , i thought i had much more.   Also watched the M. Night movie, Unbreakable, on StarMovies couple hours ago and i thought it was pretty engrossing take on the superhero genre but the ending was really abrupt, i think the movie should have played out the conclusion onscreen rather than using the on screen text at the end to wrap up the movie.    Think i might have overreacted a little on the not saying goodbye thingy (see earlier post) but it was the 2nd time it happened to me yesterday and got me really irritated. Seemed to be getting more and more irritable these days ..hmm
