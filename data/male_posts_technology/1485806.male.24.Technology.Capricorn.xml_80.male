I wanna say thank you to all the people that I have phoned..Jamie Neoh, Daniel and everyone else...who gives good advice . But God have already have a solution even before the problems arises and therefore the Holy Spirit inspired an answer and there i go tapping numbers into the new phone bought a few hours ago and called up the mechanic who fixes my car before..  Tons of minutes later my car is fixed with a new battery and the cost is RM 150 ..including the service of him coming down here from SS3 ..somewhere nearby Life Legallities 's author's old house.   Just wanna say that I had a good time besides the previous posting incident . In every storm, there 's a silver lining and this does not make an exception. I have enjoyed the company of both cute chicks in my bedroom..okay cute sisters in christ , getting an update of what happenned within the 2 - 3 years we have not met up. Stop gawking or exclaiming.Let me explain.  My fren Michelle Lai , came down to KL for an interview in my company which i helped arrange. Therefore i hosted her and my other friend Claudia Pang in my house to stay over for the night. We had a good time getting an update of what have transpired within the 2 years we have not met. I am totally taken by shock when i realized another former church member that we know very closely is getting married. And she is 23. I got her invitation for her dinner in next month's time. What a shock and a wake up call for me , that i am old ...but i believe in serving God's interest first above mine...so come to think of it...nahh..  Also because this 2 JesusFreak used to be churchmates of Hope Of God. We were glad that we left that church and I am glad God have answered my prayers of even reuniting back with my past core leaders and I learned a great deal about their lives. One things for sure...the "investment" of time made in their lives  have not gone to waste ...and they still have that passion to run to God and For God.
