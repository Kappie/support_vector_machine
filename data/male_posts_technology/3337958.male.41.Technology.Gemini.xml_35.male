Since that time, droppings have been discovered on at least 4 occasions.  I've promised each time to take more serious action to eradicate the pest, but I never went further than putting out the capture trap that we put down upstairs after the first evidence.  This time, I came home and discovered that a hole had been chewed through a breadsack, and a chunk of the bread eaten.  Droppings were left.  So now that I'm home, had the traps right there, had some peanut butter...I put out 4 traps.  I have to admit a moment of hesitation.  I'm not too keen on discovering the carcass of any animal that was killed by such cruel means, but I really want to get rid of it (them?)
