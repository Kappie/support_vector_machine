Cunning pundits like Robert Scheer and others apparently believe the best way to confront the sniper is to give him a big, sloppy kiss.   When President Bush tries to protect us from deceitful brown men, Mir and her fellow leftoids cry out, "racial profiling!"   God forbid the public be able to vote for moral reform.
