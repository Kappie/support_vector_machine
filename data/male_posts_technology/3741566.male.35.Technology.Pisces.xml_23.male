Scottee (wife) and I go over to Wendy's one day shortly after finding out that she was interested in us both and I gently lead the two of them to an inevitable night in bed. Everything was wonderful.  Why must good starts always go so wrong? At first everything is good. Sex was enjoyable and the friendship was going strong. Working with Wendy while sleeping with her also didn't seem to be a great hurdle. Looking back, I think I know where things started to go wrong.  My wife and I started to have feeling for her. Maybe if we had kept it just a friends with benefits situation things would have been ok. Scottee and I talked about things for a long time before we started to express our feelings with her. To our delight, she said she shared our feelings and was falling in love with us both. The problem was, her mouth was saying one thing while all her actions spoke the opposite. She started making excuses for being too busy to see us, broke just about every date we made with her, lied about what she was doing, and simply always seemed to have more important mundane crap to do then to spend any time around us.   This ended up being the cause of many a blow up. Once the feelings of love come they are not easily put away. I saw my wife in love with someone else for the first time in my life. While wonderful to see, it was also very painful because the person hurt her in so many ways. She or we broke the relationship off on a few occasions and were ready to cut our losses, but every time we broke apart, Wendy would be back saying that she really wanted the relationship to work out etc.   The relationship started last year in early August and it went on like this until fate stepped in and took a hand at shaping my future. I took a business trip to the east coast to see a few dealers and visit some executive at ABC in NY. Wendy had gone with me on this business trip and things turned very sour midway through the trip. She had done her usual angry routine that had become her trademark and while in the Boston area, much to my surprise, I was offered a job by one of the dealers I was visiting. I job offer I couldn't refuse.  I should diverge at this point and say a bit about my career to explain. Back in early 1998, I had taken a sales job in the audio visual field in Tampa, Florida. I worked hard for four years there with a goal of becoming much more than a simple sales person. My success there was almost overwhelming. I set higher and higher goals for myself and kept meeting them until it became apparent that I had hit a ceiling for my career there. At that point in 2001 I understood that I needed to do things at my current job that would enable me to jump ship from that company into a higher position in another company. I worked hard over the next year and eventually it became known in the industry that I was an expert in the field of home theater and in the field of projection and display technologies as a whole. In April of 2002, an opportunity arose with a display technology manufacturer and I took the job.   At first my job at the manufacturer was as product manager. At that level I was able to work remotely from Tampa. That didn't last long. One month into the new job the CEO fired my direct boss and hired me as Director of Product Management of the US. It was then that pressure started coming my way to mover out to company headquarters in the San Jose area of California. I agreed and made plans to sell my house and move. By my birthday 2003, I had driven across country and settled in San Jose. By this time, I had been promoted twice more and was now General Manager of the company and head of product development worldwide. This is how I ended up hiring Wendy as our PR Manager.   I said all that to explain my frame of mind when I was offered the Job in Massachusetts. Although my wife and I loved it in San Jose, there were some problems living out there. I worked for a Taiwanese company that traditionally underpaid for the position I was at. My wife is a stay at home mom since shortly after our first child was born and we have both agreed that she is to stay in that position until such time as she wants to go back to work. The cost of living in the bay area was sucking up our savings and it was becoming obvious that staying out there was going to sooner or later mean that I'd have to get a raise or that we'd have to drastically cut back expenses. When the job offer came, there were so many positives that I couldn't ignore them. Let me list them for you.  1. Half again as much money with the opportunity through bonuses to soon make over twice what I was in California 2. Lower cost of living, although still high compared with Florida 3. I was born in NY and had always loved the New England. 4. The people here were far more friendly open and honest than any I've met anywhere in the country. 5. Best public schools anywhere in the US. (I don't live in Boston) 6. Less traffic 7. Bigger house on two acres 8. A better title on the resume (Vice President). I know it might sound shallow but when you have a family to feed, small things become important.  The list went on and on, so it was a no brainer for Scottee and I to decide to move. Only one thing really stood in the way, Wendy. We were both very much in love with her, even though Wendy wasn't the most emotionally stable person we've ever met, you can't choose what your heart decides.  We told her of our plans and as expected, all hell broke loose. I think she just wasn't in a place in her life to understand what was going on and she was certainly not in a place emotionally to deal with us leaving.  We said our goodbye and drove across country again out to Acton, MA. Everyone knows long distance relationships don't work and this one was no exception. Within a few weeks it became obvious that Wendy was taking it very hard. I won't even discuss how bad Scottee and I were taking it.   The thing about me that I hope everyone learns is that I have certain values and ideals that I live and think by and these ideas are absolutes to me. I knew I didn't want this relationship to end so I went about making it work. I knew I could desperately use her at my new company for the things I needed to do here. In all honesty she was by far the most qualified for the position I needed and it was easy to convince the owner of that.   It was really putting my ass on the line. The risk is that I have the company spend 10k in moving her out here and that she flakes out again and quits. With her it was a distinct possibility. My heart won out and I we sent her an offer letter.  Stay tuned for the next installment (the last few months of drama)
