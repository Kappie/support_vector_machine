Double your possible users and then tell all the users that they have to use (create new user IDs and passwords) a brand new application by Wednesday and it will tend to get busy.  It is so busy that somtimes I find myself not caring that someone is on the line waiting, something I never ever would let happen in the past.  We lose another one on Friday as Scottie is leaving to take a job in Southern Illinois.  I dont think he understands how far away Southern Illinois is.   It has been fun having Ann back in town.  I have a lto more stuff to do when she is around.  She yed her hair two nights ago.  it looks an awesome maroon color.  My hair is getting a little long now.  not near as long as Justin's but my sideburns are much cooler looking...atleast I think so.
