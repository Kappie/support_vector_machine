Just thankful that there were no serious injuries or regressions!  I'm back baby!  On a lighter note, at lunch I was on the horn with my buddy Bobby Splode and I was getting cut off by 2 Asian drivers in a 30 second time span.  Needless to say my mouth began to spout some colorful observations while my buddy is on the phone.  He sent me this as a follow up.  urlLink Too funny!   Have a Chow Shit Fun Time my Blogga fuckers!
