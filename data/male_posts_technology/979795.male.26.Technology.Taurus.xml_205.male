A huge number of students from different countries have benefited from their experiences with him. His passing is a truly sad event and I feel that he will be sorely missed. But we can all be glad that his many students show that a part of him lives on in them and I hope that every bit of his legacy will be passed on and down to the future generations of Aikido-kas.  I've also been reading up on Aikido Yuishinkai's founder, Koretoshi Maruyama Sensei. He once held office as the President of Ki no Kenkyukai.  He offered some particularly enlightening insights about Aikido. I've exerpted some from their  urlLink website .  "to ‘move quickly’ does not mean ‘body speed,’ but ‘mind speed’.  Through Ki extension and by using the mind, the body can respond naturally and quickly."  "When questioned about aikido politics and the Aikido Yuishinkai’s founding premise of, ‘Aikido without boundaries’, Sensei explained that all styles of aikido are welcome to train and that Aikido Yuishinkai students are free to experience training wherever they choose. Sensei further explained that politics are like American English.  Depending on the geographic part of the country you happen to be in, everyone thinks their own accent is the correct one.  He expressed that there was only one aikido, that taught by the founder, Morihei Ueshiba.  Differences are created by different perceptions.  Much division is created by money and ego. Maruyama Sensei doesn’t see his aikido as ‘right’ and everyone else’s as ‘wrong’.  He says aikido is like a feast.  Some choose the salty foods and some choose the sweet.  Everyone should decide what they like. He said Aikido Yuishinkai was like a beautiful fruit tree.  It does not need to be advertised or promoted-people will come to pick the precious fruit."
