I spent the last two days living on Trains and I am spending two days next week on Planes and Trains so it will be kinda quiet then too..  First off my plans for the site.. I am going to try and get a proper server come next pay day! Wh0ot! so I can write the ASP code I wanna write and give you all the site you wish you had never found.. (I know, it's like this horrible crash that you can't stop staring at.. And so far we have done only 1/5th of the things we want to do with it..)  Plans for the site include a new Blogging engine that will allow anyone that wants one to sign up on the site and get one hosted here! (We're so generous) Also going to build a nice little forum (or use one of the other open-source ones that are out there.. depends on how things go on the female front really.. atm it looks like I will have more than enough time on my hands to build one myself from scratch..) so you can all abuse each other in a shared and easy to access area.. There are a few other plans I have afoot, but I need to see how feasable they are before I post anything solid.. (But personal image galleries does look like a distinct possibility..)  Now for a bit of personal crap.. Life is pretty good at the moment.. Going to witness with  urlLink Karl  and  urlLink Ash  which should be.... "fun".... ;)  Also the romantic life is slowly but surely coming together.. I'd tell you more but then someone would probably try to kill me..  Jonny somehow has eluded death so far.. I really am going to have to see what I can do about that REALLY soon..  BTW, if you want something to laugh at there is a good chance me and bubbles will be in the Sports Bar in Temple Bar pointing and laughing at Tony D and doing everything we can to help bubbles with his "itch"
