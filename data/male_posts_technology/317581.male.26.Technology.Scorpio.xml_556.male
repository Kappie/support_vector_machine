I feel like I cheated on him a little ;)  Well, I woke at 6:00am this morning, as well as numerous other times of the night. My alarm was set for 6:45. So I ran around greenlake and got home by 7:30ish. Not a bad way to start the day :)  I spent 9 hours here yesterday. That was "nice" and I may be doing OT again next weekend. We'll have to see.  Peace- T
