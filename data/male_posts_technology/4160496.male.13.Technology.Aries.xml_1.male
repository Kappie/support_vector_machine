At this time, I was seriously impatient and wanted to go to gameworks very badly so I went.  met my good friend Ben (aka bioclown) and went to the pad, the pad was slightly off. and yet I could still AA many songs, there was this one girl with a yellow shirt who was quite interesting she was quite good. one thing that was funny during that when someone played Sexy planet (oni remix) when the up-left, left, *repeat for a few times* everyone was doing a thrust it was quite amusing. I was behind a girl when doing but I wasnt directly behind her. then after a while i went to the ddrusa machine and I finally full comboed something on no speed mods, I got 3rd place on the machine as "GMP" (I messed it up alitte) then after wards, I played on the extreme machine with Ben; and alot of people wanted me to play Paranoia Survivor on Final stage,  when I did play, I kinda paced my self at the beggining and then when hell runs came, my shoelace broke and I wasnt sure if i was missing anything or not i was just followning the sequence to the best of my ability and surely enough, I passed it with a "B"  when I did my last run on ddrusa, I got number 2 on the ranking page and my old score was at 4th (my new score was initialed as "GPS")
