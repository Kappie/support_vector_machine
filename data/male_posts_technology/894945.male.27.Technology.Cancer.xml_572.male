Today I am here to talk to you about what I have been up to over the past few quiet months, well actually it's quite simple- I have been locked in a suspended box for the past 92 days! (David Blaine, eat your heart out- oh hang on, you probably would have done if you could!)  Ok ok seriously then, I have been a busy little boy! Lets see....  I have been reviving old hobbies like painting, modeling and my music collection, which by the way is beginning to take over my room!  I have seen in my Dad's 50th year of existence,  My parents silver wedding,   And I have been away several times.  Now in more detail, my parents 25th anniversary was totally cool as I got to set up and fire a fireworks display. I even met up with my old work mate who I have know all my life, which was good.  I have been slaving away in my cousins workshop, helping him create a large medieval city for a wargame, this being a bloody big project!  Custard and I went to London to visit our friend Ying Ying for her birthday. This was a pretty good trip which involved partying, getting pissed and watching England's rugby team crush Georgia hehe. We also got to see Mr.Blaine hanging about next to Tower Bridge, although that was pretty boring as he was mostly sleeping at the time, although he did get up for about fifteen minutes or so. In fact the most exciting thing was viewing him taking a piss down his piss tube (see how boring it was!). Mark and I also went to see the Lord Of The Rings exhibition at the national science museum which was good fun. Oh, three things to note about London:  1) Why does everybody you pass in the street or subway look like they are ready to kill themselves? 2) If you do go the  national science museum, take a GPS in with you as you WILL get lost!! 3) If your on the piss, go to a bar called Extra Time, as you can purchase fresh pizza right until closing time..YAY!  So now we are back home and I am once again stressed up to the eyeballs with having to sort out our roleplay clubs Halloween special! A lot of people are coming over for it from our sister club in Guernsey which is cool, it's just that there is so much to sort out tat it is beginning to grate on me! But there you go, with responsibility comes lots of shit!.  Bonfire night however is hopefully going to be a blast- LITERALLY! I have rounded up my cousins and a load of friends and we have somewhere around the region of £800 of fireworks to fire off haha! I cannot wait, in fact I had to let off a rocket last night just to fuel the habit!  Anyway, I may post some of my photos from various events of the past months and hopefully I may even post a bit more hehe! Right, got to go now, much to do and not enough time to do it in.  Baity signing off.....  P.S. If you have never watched Twin Peaks, WATCH IT!!!
