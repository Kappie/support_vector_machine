After I thought about it, I began to think that maybe the individual had a significant trend identified. So I did some checking.  The high end developer is using Apple's PowerBook for its Unix underpinnings and Java integration. Key to the evangelist is the explicit and overt support for the hardware by Dr. James Gosling, the founder and key contributor to the Java Programming Language.  What Dr. Gosling uses the PowerBook for is also the "Mac" only development environment known as Cocoa. Cocoa is the product name that Apple provided for the development environment acquired when they bought Steve Jobs from Nexxt.  I also use Eclipse and Netbeans, but use Cocoa and purchased WebObjects from Apple. Cocoa is also used as the primary development environment by my kids. Yes it is that sophisticated and capable that Gosling and my kids are now using the same development environments. My oldest (13) uses Cocoa with a group of like minded kids in California and Kentucky through their iSight webcams.   The point is that I subscribe to Cocoa, WebObjects, Eclipse and Netbeans environment mailing lists. (Please review how I use Gmail in this blog.) The volume of WebObjects and Cocoa based mail is significant. In most cases almost 5 to 1 of the other environments. Is that good or a reflection of more problems. The analysis shows that Cocoa based questions and answered are being debated by academic and scientific based individuals. (Apple quietly announced a science based market drive that is reaping big rewards for the firm.) The doctors and scientists are solving and debating some severe technical issues. They are not debating minor points.   Although Eclipse and Netbeans are young and starting the troubles and difficulties of these environments don't compare to the robustness and maturity of the 10+ heritage of Cocoa and WebObjects, but they are still crawling. It will be interesting to see if anyone suggests that Jobs should take Apple out of the development and science based areas as well. I would expect they will catch on to this and make that recommendation in as little as two years from now.
