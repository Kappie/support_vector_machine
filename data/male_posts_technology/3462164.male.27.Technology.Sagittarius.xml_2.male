I think the question on every MMA fan's mind is:  "Will the appropriate title be UFC 48-Money back?  I don't believe so.  We have the popular and standard striker vs. grappler, legend vs. legend, a blood boiling desire for revenge, people fighting to keep their career in the UFC, upon many more drama stories worthy of a UFC soap opera (as opposed to the reality show currently in the making.)  As with any other mixed martial arts event, UFC 48 has the potential to explode in a fury of fierce fighting action.    It will live up to its potential as a powder keg, and then some.  Below are the picks that I have come up with upon reading the exciting line-up.  You may agree or disagree, but either way you must admit that calling mixed martial arts fights is like calling heads or tails, you truly never know what the result will be.  Enjoy the UFC's next installment in...UFC 48-Payback, tomorrow night on Pay Per View.  My picks:  Georges St. Pierre by submission in round 2. I'll just take a wild guess and say by armbar.  Matt Serra by submission in round 2 or 3. I'll even be more specific in saying perhaps by way of a triangle or rear naked choke.  Curtis Stout by a late TKO or unanimous decision after three rounds of exciting back and forth action. (This will also be huge money maker, considering Stout is somehow the under dog as far as betting is concerned.)  Frank Trigg by unanimous decision after three great rounds.   Phil Baroni by TKO in round one, getting full revenge for the horrible event that happened the last time they met in the octagon. He won't let Evan Tanner slip through his fingers this time.  Tim Sylvia by TKO in round one. Although I do feel that Mir has a chance, and I'd like him to win by submission (and could visualize it happening in round two) I just don't think it'll happen.  Matt Hughes by TKO in round two. I can almost see this one as clear as I can see my hand in front of my face. Matt Hughes in side control, pounding Renato Verrisimo until the ref tackles Matt to bring a hault to the fight.  Ken Shamrock by submission in round two. I'm just going out on a limb here for shits and giggles and saying Ken will bust out his patented ankle lock to tap Kimo. This one could really go either way though, I don't care what anybody says.
