It was quite an experience because I've never gone for such a distance for 5 days. For guys who've done the route marches in BMT, it's not particularly difficult. It was a matter of getting used to doing the same thing for the next few days.  Anyway, a lot of reasons why I decided to cut my trip short. I've had to because I realised that my trip to Scandinavia actuallt burnt my finances by quite a lot. A lot of complications involved. Also, I managed to contact a property owner about renting a space for my parents during convo, I'd thought I best settle this fast and there's no better way than to come back early to do so. Next, on the last day of the trek, I got caught in a drizzle/rain. Basically I've been sick for the past 2 days. Last, I'm not sure I want to do 2 treks 1 after another (though I do have a 2 day rest inb between them). I do really want to go back to Scotland but I think I'm not physically and mentally prepared right now to do both. There's just too many thing hanging on my mind. I'm not one to be able to multi-task so I think I'll just tackle one issue at a time.  I'll be posting my journal of this trek online soon as well. Photos will take sometime though.
