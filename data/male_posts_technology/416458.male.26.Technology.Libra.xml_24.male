At the core our code is five years old, has been optimised and works extremely well. Our problems have come from adding a new layer over that code. In this case a WebDAV implementation, for communications with the administration application. Now WebDAV specifies oppourtunities for optimisation of the protocol, for example you are able to ask for a partial set of a resources properties.  Well the WebDAV optimisations didn't quite fit with our model and so we were getting all the properties each time, planning on fixing this later....it got forgotten.
