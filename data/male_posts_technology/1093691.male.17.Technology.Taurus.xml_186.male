To be honest with you all i reakon the newspapers just print the stroies to get attention, they arnt in it to deliver us news they are in it for money-- How discracefull is that? And to be honest why do they have to print about 12 pages all about how it crashed, why it crashed, when it crashed, who was in it, why they were in it, how their families are coping, pictures of it ( how rude is that) and then not fogeting they then write most of it all over again the next day. I used to read the newspaper every day with out fail but now i tend to read it if there is something good on the front page and then i only read half of the paper cause they write a load of shit in it ! What is the world coming too? Any way sorry bout my rant there just letting off a litlle steam, and id like to say im going naked to the ball ! bye
