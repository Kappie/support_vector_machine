Yesterday, smoke all you can, today, smoke only twelve.  Lisa and I have received a lot of flack from our colleagues, all nonsmokers, about our program.  Therefore, where once the plan raged under the banner reading "The Great Smoke Out," the plan will be here after known as "Butt Out!" to all nonsmokers.  That is to say with the exception of Lisa and I who are grandfathered in.  Once we cross the threshold and enter nonsmokerdom we shall still be able to refer to the utterly successful "The Great Smoke Out" program as "The Grate Smoke Out" of aught-four.
