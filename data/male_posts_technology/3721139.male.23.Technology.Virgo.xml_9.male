Oh well, on  Sunday , I visited A Church of Christ.  I didn't make it in time for the service, but caught the college class instead.  The  a cappella  worship was really lovely, but the guy who delivered the message seriously rambled from here to Kentucky and back.  Presumably, he wanted to talk about what the Bible says about judging others, and I guess he made a few good points (like, don't give destructive criticism, like say, in the form of a personal ad directed against your ex who, despite the reality, you're still in love with - an amazingly concrete example *wink*), but it really didn't ring my bell. Ya know?    Ok, now it gets interesting.  I got a good hair cut - if you know me, then you'll know that it's always been a shot in the dark to get a good cut.  I dropped $80 on a webcam, then I set up daveshottyparadise.com so that I can "perform" and whatnot for kinky fun and profit (cha-ching!).  Just kidding, but I did get a webcam, and I had a whole lot of fun making silly recordings of myself and taking pictures.  I enjoyed watching the lighting flash, the thunder roar, and the rain fall cleaning my car (whoop) and washing away all chances of getting to swim in the outdoor pool (hiss).  Then, of course, I went up to the Rec.  I was really happy with my climbing; I was able to complete a number of different routes that I was struggling with last week.  Kinda disappointed in the lap pool though, my joints felt really close to hyperextending on almost every stroke.  Maybe I'm just paranoid about another knee injury.  Oh, and I've gained about 10lbs since going on my diet which is awesome, the extra muscle was really helping me climb better.  Physically, I'm feeling pretty confident.  Maybe my mind's playing tricks, but I think I've noticed more people checkin' me out.  Sweet.    Emotionally, I'm pretty blank.  Definitely not depressed or sad or anything like that, and definitely happier on average, but still pretty disappointed that the best thing to come into my life is now gone.  Knowing that I have no grounds for pity (see also: caricature urlLink  ), well, that leaves me feeling blank.  I'd like to reconcile, but that's going to be on your terms.  And there's still the matter of the story I'm writing about you.  I'm trying to paint the most clear picture of how I understand you from what I know about you; I hope you'll find it revealing and appreciate it.  Who knows though? Who can say?    Oh, now I remember, I saw a matinee showing of "The Bourne Supremacy" on Saturday.  That movie is so incrediably cool - you've got to check it out.  It's coming back to me now, I woke up early and paid my bills online (still have to pay utilities - don't forget dave!), talked to my mom for about an hour.  I love my mom, I told her about the caricature and she didn't rip me a new one. Her birthday is today.  Happy Birthday, Mom.  I talked to a business partner of mine, and I may (read:  may ) be moving to Raleigh, North Carolina and get paid a generous salary to work on a number of different projects.   I finished up the night chatting on the IM with someone.   So, Saturday wasn't as action-packed as Sunday, but still pretty enjoyable.    That's my weekend, I hope you had a good one too.
