I would much rather read about other people's problems, days and lives than have them read about my own,  But oh well, I'll give this a try.  By far this is the worst year of my life.  Things from January til mid April were just shitty for my family.  Suicide attempts, job loss, heart problems, blood pressure, drug problems, deaths, broken hips and lots of problems.  Well, just when I had thought that May was great and June was almost over problem free, WHAM!  My grandmother who broke her hip in March (and was only given a week to live then) has gotten pneumonia and was found in her bed on Tuesday morning bleeding from the mouth and nose.  She is so fragile that the coughing she had been doing was ripping her throat open and causing her to bleed.  So she was rushed to the hospital where she was put on IV and oxygen immediately.  Within a few hours, she was doing better, but not much.  The coughing and such had subsided.  The poor woman is 96, and will be 97 in July.  She has Alhzeimers and knows no one.  It really hurts my Dad for him Mother to not know who he is.  She has gone from being about 180 lbs and in decent health in the early 90's to being an 80 lb person with no quality of life, who knows no one, is blind in both eyes, is deaf and doesn't speak.  I find it so unfair that young people are killed every day, all around the world, yet here is a woman who 'I haven't known in 10 years' who is in pain with a broken hip, requires morphine daily to keep down the pain.  She lies in bed suffering, and yet people are dying every day who I know she would if she could, gladly give them her life.  Anyway, enough with that.  I feel so much better now that I've vented.  And for those who didn't know, I recently started a new job in May.  I am a Support Specialist Level I at the University of Lethbridge library.  I moved across Canada to be here.  I live with Weagle (Scott) and Sydney (Susan) currently.  I am really enjoying my new job and the new area.  As my new manager said this morning, "You'll be my Jake-of-all-trades."  I will be doing html and java script, along with redesigning some webpages for the library, along with my current PC repair and media duties.  I'm excited.  The more useful I can make myself, the better chance that this will become a full time position for me after this contract expires.  Other than that, I really don't have much more to say.  For the last week, I have been watching my DVD set of Robotech, the first series, with Rick Hunter, Minmei, Max Sterling, Lisa Hayes and crew.  It's a great anime series from the early 80's.  I can't get enough of it.  But at 50 dollars a boxed set, and I have 3 of the 7, I couldn't afford more.  But then I tried Ebay and found them for about 5 dollars to 10 dollars American and started buying them up.  2 more sets are on the way and I'm currently bidding on 2 more.  This rocks!  It's exciting.  This weekend will be fairly quiet.  I hope to go to Cranbrook with Scott and Susan to drop off Susan's car for her parents, but I may just stay home and watch the NASCAR race from Sonoma, California!  I love road racing.  Anyway, enjoy your weekends and we'll see you again soon.  Same blog-time, same blog-channel!
