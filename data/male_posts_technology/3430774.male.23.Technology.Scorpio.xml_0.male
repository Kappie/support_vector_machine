Right now, the service is in Beta but when it is available to the public, you will be able to enjoy 1 Gigabyte of storage space. This will probably mean that you won't have to delete a message for a few years.   - The new service promises to take away the need to delete unwanted messages and organise e-mail according to topic.  - The service is still being tested and not yet generally available, but will be offered for free on www.gmail.com.  - Google mail provides one gigabyte of storage - many times more than existing rivals that also offer free e-mail.  - Each user would have storage equivalent to 500,000 pages of e-mail, said Google.    When this service finally rolls out, it will not include nor currently offer POP3 access. Google has this to say about that; Your email should never be held hostage by a service provider. In the future you will be able to access Gmail messages from non-Gmail accounts for free or at a nominal fee. Looks like the "balance", in the email game, is about to tip.
