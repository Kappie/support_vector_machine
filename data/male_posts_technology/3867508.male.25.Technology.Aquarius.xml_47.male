Anyways let me enlighten you all some more :)   urlLink AlterNet: MediaCulture: Political Barbies  You know when most of that liberal media has been giving Teresa Heinz Kerry a hard time about being "too outspoken" or "too opinionated", all I could think about was, well what did these people want?!  Another Laura Bush, who just sits there and smiles, and is shown reading to children or passing recipes around?  Well that article addresses all of these things.  It is disgusting when a Newsweek article is headlined and I  QUOTE !    "Teresa: Is John Kerry's Heiress Wife a Loose Cannon-or Crazy Like a Fox?"    What the hell kind of headline is that?!  Is she bad or bad?  That isn't a choice, that is telling you what to think of her, that my friends amounts to character assassination.   urlLink AlterNet: Election 2004: It's about the Teachers  Ok this one's for you Leah, and all you teachers or teachers to be.  Imagine this, and yeah I am talking to you Republican Bud, John Kerry actually has an education plan that has some new ideas in it!  Take a read.  Pay raises for good teachers whose students show results.  And not just mandatory raises for seniority.  Anyways you can read the rest.     urlLink t r u t h o u t - Ronnie Dugger | How They Could Steal the Election this Time  I know I linked this article in earlier posts today BUT this article really disturbed me.  This article is a staggering indictment of the electronic voting systems that are in place around the country, and the reasons why some don't want to change out these machines which are possibly susceptible to tampering.  Hey RB remember Election 2000, HERE is where we should remember the debacle that was the 2000 election.  Ok put that in your noodle and cook it.  Wait that didn't make any sense.  Sorry I will try harder next time.
