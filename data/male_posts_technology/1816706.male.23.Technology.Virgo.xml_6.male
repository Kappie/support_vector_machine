My room just got voted #1 for the least amount of roaches, we were very proud about that.  I have 7 room mates right now, most of them are cool, but new people come and go all the time, most of them are very cool, very friendly, and have good stories to share.  I also had to rent a piece of shit car today, 88 corolla baby!  The buses are still on strike here and it was driving me up a wall not being able to go to places.  I drove to the Windward (east) side of Oahu today and went snorkeling in Hanauma bay - I'll add some pics later.  It was cool though. Job hunt is going ok, a few offers, nothing that blew my hair back, the ones that did require Secret Security Clearance, so I am working on that right now, they go back 10 years into your past, places you lived, worked, people you know, etc.  Pretty crazy but I'm sure it will pay off.  Off to have a beer and chilli cheese hot dogs at the hostel.
