Damn it!!!!Anyway it is my first time calling up after 24 years in this planet?  Jen was complaining that I did not dedicate song to her and Adrian after hearing me on live. I called my buddy to tune in as well. The topic is about apologising and the realisation of the need to apologise came so late that it is no longer an issue but at least I learn something out of it. Very excited about it! Damn Damn Damn I still can taste the freshness of excitement Man Man Man...just like the sentence find in the Movie Titanic.  Anyway I had a fun day, entire day I mean. Busy ogling at fantastically beautiful woman while working. Day went smoooootthhh....but my cigz went ooooohhhhhh cos menthol lights sucks! yucks! fucks! Beside a smooth day at work the only unsmooth thingy is my company van....it is screetching like crazy inside out and I have no idea what happen.  This saturday is coming! And I am looking forward to it! But guess I have no partner to bring to after my buddy is attached. LOOK is ALL your fault buddy! Hahaha...but no is me who do not allow you to go :D  Principles is principles ya? There is a thin line drawn between principles and MCPists which most of the time people get it wrongly not for my case at least but other day to day life and relationship.  Ny noodle is good for myself! Is yummy! I had a problem cooking it nicely on Saturday while over at Adrian's house. Western Food is up next week! Black Pepper BBQ Steak sound great huh? I gonna get some of it while brushing up my culinary skill.
