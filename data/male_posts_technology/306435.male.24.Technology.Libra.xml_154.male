Ann is back.  It is great.  In August, I flew out to Missoula and we drove back to Cincinnati.  We went down through Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons.  We stopped in Lander, Wyoming and had a visit with Elizabeth.  We then headed to Colorado stopping in Boulder and Denver.  We stayed in Denver for a couple days and I drove on the highest road in North America on the way up Mt. Evans.  I will be scanning pictures this week to post.  After Denver we headed back to Ohio.  The drive through the flat Midwest is, well as flat.  Since being back Ann has got a new job and a roommate, the honorable Elizabeth End.    Other things around own have changed as well.  K$ took got a full time teaching job in Madison, Indiana and the Reds sold their entire team away to AL contenders.  I am not sure which one bothers me more.  The Bengals have shown promise.  Just enough to make me get excited for Sunday, but not enough to win.  Colin and Matt started high school at St. X and are running cross country.    Kelly scored a 1430 on her SATs.  The Mavericks never won another game and self distrusted while I was out west.  No one from the team can really tell me what happened, but I am not so sure I really want to know.  Kristin and Greg moved to China, er I mean Murray.  Jim and Kristen got engaged at a DMB concert.      Let's see what else can I catch all my loyal readers up on...hello loyal reader(s)?  Where are you?
