So here is what happened over the weekend:   Saturday :  We got up at 5:00am this morning, after going to bed at 1:00am last night, so that we could catch the greyhound bus.  First let me say that I thought that the greyhound would be a nice and relaxing way to travel since we do not have a car.  Well I was wrong.  We had to get to the station an hour early to get our tickets, which was not too bad.  But then we got on the bus.  As we got on we noticed that the seats were packed together like sardines and that were left out for a few days.  Luckily we were the first stop so we got a seat together.  However someone on the bus had something emitting from their body that was like rotten eggs.  Other than that the bus ride went ok with the 6 stops and 4 1/2 hrs to get to Vancouver.  Once we got into Vancouver my parents picked us up and took us out to lunch, which was really fun.  Then we went to their house and saw Hunter, who we have been missing very badly.  We then took a trip up to their property, with the dogs.  While there Clair put me to work climbing trees and stringing a line across part of their property.  He also brought his new toy, a chainsaw.  So I had my first experience cutting down a tree.  It was fun until Clair was cutting one down and it started to fall the wrong way and I jumped into a blackberry bush by mistake to avoid it (it ended up going the right direction though).  After a couple of hours there we went back to their house and played some games, drank margaritas, and had some BB-Q.     Sunday   Fourth of July :  Today was another fun day.  We got up and hung around the house for a bit and then decided to go play some miniature golf.  The course was fun and a little challenging.  Needless to say Clair the golfer won both rounds.  The sun was out that day and most of us got a little burned due to not seeing the sun much.  We then went home and played some Uno Attack, this game can take quite some time to finish.  Becca and I made nachos, which is our cheap student meal, that were very good if I do say so myself.  As for fireworks we did not want to go to Fort Vancouver because it gets so crowded that you can't breath.  So we decided to look and see if we could see them from somewhere else.  We found a really nice spot on the Oregon side of the Columbia and it had a really nice view.  The only problem was that is was very windy and cold, but fun none the less.  We went home after the 40min fireworks and played with some of our own.  That was about it for the 4th.   Monday :  Today Clair and I got up early to go up to the property because they were going to break ground today.  It was really neat to see how the guy started to level out the property and to see how powerful a bulldozer is.  There were many rocks in the way, but that did not seem to matter.  We only got to stay for a little while because we had to get back to catch the greyhound home.  I have to say that the trip home was worse than the trip there.  This time we were not the first stop, so there was very limited seating.  We had the privilege to sit next to the stinky toilet.  There was also a lady that liked to talk really loud in her cell phone and yell at her kids.  There was another guy in front of us that could not sit still and had to have his seat fully reclined back.  That did not help me study for a sort test I have on Tuesday for work.  This trip took about 45min longer than the last due to traffic.  While on the bus we found out that there was an express bus we could have taken.  That did not make us feel good.  But we made it home at last and went to bed very early, after we took a shower from being on the bus.  All in all the trip was well worth it and we had a lot of fun seeing my parents and I hope everyone else had a wonderful 4th as well.  Also while Becca is in China I am going to try and go to help Clair work on the house, if I can get the time off.
