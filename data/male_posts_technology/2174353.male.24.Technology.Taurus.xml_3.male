I have recently been informed that Australian High Commission has started rejecting visas for students seeking admission in Master programs with a 3 years Bachelors. Since, my case is similar, upon persuasion of my consultant I have withdrawn my application.  Interestingly, though, this is a recent policy and wasn't applicable a few months back (Hint: Another batchmate, Usman, went with a similar qualification and a 1.5 year worth of lesser work experience). The restriction might be lifted next year. This means that it's a tailor made restriction and I have been saved from going to Australia at the last moment!   Still, human beings like to cling to their ideas/plans, so I have discussed this issue with Dr. Ata-ur-Rehman and he might help. Anyways, these days I am re-planning everything and have been provided useful insight by some friends (special thanks to Hamid, Kasbati, Kazim, Rashid, Usman and Kami). Most probably, I will apply for Chalmers Sweden and LUMS (or perhaps Canada/England too). Back to the starting track! I would be glad if somebody joins me in this effort. I might also attempt at GRE in the first two quarters.  The result of the whole activity has been that I got an 8.5 in IELTS; I have gathered some pretty good information on studying abroad; also became good friends with a few education consultants and some hard-working Pakistanis studying abroad.  Just a regular update from my side...    "I have told you before, there's no escaping the nature of the universe. It is that nature that has again brought you to me.
