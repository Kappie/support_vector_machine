I couldn't find much information on these topics earlier.  But today, I found something interesting. NCST (National Centre for Software Technology) Bangalore (now known as C-DAC)has a particular research group called " urlLink Data  Knowledge Engineering " which works on Semantic Web. Its quite good to see indian institutes moving in that direction. They have a number of projects running in the knowledge domain.  - KMap - A Web-based Knowledge Management Application   -  urlLink Viksha  - Knowledge Enabling Devices  Viksha  aims at building a channel through which extraction and addition of knowledge through different data sources existing inside an organisation and combining it with Internet. The whole system is broadly categorized into three parts: -Existing databases, Ontology and then an Intelligent Browser.  -  urlLink VXML  - Visual Document XMLiser  Aim is to convert unstructured text data to structured XML format using a Visual Editor.  - Semantic Web  urlLink Annotation Tool   The Annotation System makes it possible to make/search annotations using a plugin for Internet Explorer. The annotations can be stored both at the client and at the server end.  The screenshots of the available tools look quite good. Currently not available in public domain, but perhaps might be there soon.
