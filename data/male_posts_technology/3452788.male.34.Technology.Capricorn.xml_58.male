I don't know how I cam to establish "the rules" of my life, but I know that one of them is that to be satisfied with myself, I need to do it right or perfect every time, all the time.  Anything less than perfection equates to failure.  I have always been very confident in my ability to do things and reason through situations, but if I have problems I see that as a failure.  If I have potential to do sometihng right, but I don't, I have either wasted my potential or I haven't tried my hardest, both of which are greivous sins.  By these rules, how can I succeed at anything?  I have created a situation where I must fail almost every time, even when others see a partial or almost complete success.  I cannot trust anyone to do things for me because (by my rules) they will fail also, either through their own shortcomings or by my expectation of their performance holding up to my standard of perfection.  As a result of these rules, I feel like I have failed repeatedly in life, although when I logically step outside myself and look at the record, I hove accomplished some  good things in my life.  Unfortunately, it is nearly impossible for me to have any pride or satisfaction or sense of accomplishment in my near-successes.  I get no satisfaction at all for being intelligent, completing college, the ability to change careers, financial stability, stong love for my kids, etc.  It is like being in an art gallery, staring at the paintings, but feeling no sense of beauty at all, only emptiness.  In addition, what I am doing right now, writing about my problems, is very important to my sanity, but is also a source of guilt.  I am supposed to be working on a report right not, but I'm not.  This means I am trying my hardest or putting out my best effort, therefore I am failing not only myself but my employer.  Then I get paid for doing my job, so to get paid for wasting time and failing is essentially fraud.  I should be caught and fired the same as if I was stealing money from the company.  But I don't care about work right now.  I just want to get rid of the gray emptiness.  What is important to me, stupid work, or saving myself from destruction?  I know how fucked up this line of reasoning is, but I don't feel like I can ever escape it.
