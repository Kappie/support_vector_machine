Over the last couple of days, my wife and I between us mowed the lawn, trimmed the edges (of the lawn, natch), painted the spare room twice, did five loads of dishes and four loads of laundry, folded all the above-mentioned laundry, cleaned off the dining room table (which had a bunch of crap on it), cleaned the guinea pigs' cage, and a few other random chore-ey things.  It's nice to have felt like I (we) actually accomplished something for once, since I so often feel that I'm just being too lazy.  Maybe tonight I'll be brave and get around to cleaning my office...  Or at least get a few more steps into doing so.  Ever since my computer moved out of my office, my motivation for cleaning it has been approximately nil.  Very sad, really.  But eventually I'll clean it.  After all, if it gets too bad, it'd cut off access to my board games - they're in my closet in the back of that room.  I'm getting very nervous about this Friday.  I don't know why, but the idea of having someone put me under and pull out two teeth is really just starting to freak me out.  I've been told over and over again that it's not a big deal and such, and logically I know that, but logic isn't often very comforting.  I think it actually bugs me more, though, that my wife's friend is coming over that evening for the weekend - I'm expecting to pretty much be semi-conscious or unconscious from Friday lunchtime until Saturday evening, and the idea of her friend being there for the entire time bothers me.  She really doesn't seem to care.  Sometimes, I wish she'd be a little more sensitive - I don't want to ask her out-right, but she's ignored my comments that I'm not comfortable with it with her catch-all "What difference does it make?  You'll be asleep."  That really isn't the point, and I wish she'd notice.  So I'm still trying to figure out what to do tonight.  I think I might just end up playing Mechwarrior 4: Mercs for a while.  I'll do some cleaning, and I'm going to be grilling burgers, but that should still leave time to amuse myself by shooting helpless little 'Mechs.  Mmmm, shooting helpless little 'Mechs...  Anyway.  I'd like to say, for the record, as much as I may be no good at it, I really do enjoy writing, sometimes.  Bad grammar included.  My short story over at  HMP  is a good distraction for me.  It's gotten good reviews from the various posters there, so far...  But then, some things I think are absolute crap have gotten good reviews from the same posters.  I shouldn't get too excited over it.  It's nice to get some vague form of validation on my efforts, though, y'know?  Ah, well.  Back to work, I suppose.
