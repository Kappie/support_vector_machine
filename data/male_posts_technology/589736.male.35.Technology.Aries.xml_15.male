'cause *damn* it's a long way back south, in the opposite direction of everything else we want to see, even by way of the cave network previously mentioned...  after we find out about castillian, i say we:  - clear our names, expose the conspiracy, report the lizard men sighting - determine burne's fate - go destroy the keech fields and, maybe, lividia - find a big enough city where we can all train and otherwise increase our skills  not necessarily in that order, but close enough.  was the Hand mentioned as possibly being involved in our current predicament, in regards to the murder we've been accused of?  can't *believe* that Zhenterem bitch killed that banker and framed us for the murder,  just so she could raise him from the dead to steal from his own deceased grandmother.  way to go, rhanellus!  burn baby burn...
