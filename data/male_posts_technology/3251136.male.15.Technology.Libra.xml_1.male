From the very first day, I was all alone, silently whispering to myself, without anyone ever noticing  Till the third day, you came to me, and as time passes, we became close friends  When it comes to sorrow, you didnt complain but stay, sharing the sorrow and disappointment, which not everyone will do  When it comes to joy, we had a great time, times all problems are forgotten, though it never last long  Together we spread the chain, the chain of friends, from one to four, from four to eight  It was perhaps the only, the only chain of friendship, which i really hope, it will last long  Time indeed flies like wind, throughout the short time, we had fun and joy, which will never be forgotten  However i am aware, all beginning has an end, and sooner or later, this chain will break  My thought was right, slowly one by one left, leaving this chain of friendship, never the same again  Till the very last end, the time i realise, that friendship was most important, it was already too late....  friendship is indeed very important..not one can live without frens...if u choose to let go friendship cox of sum stupid reasons...u'll regret 1 day..trust me..friends are realli realli important...thank you...
