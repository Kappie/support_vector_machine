       Have you ever watched a movie where there is a train dramatically approaching a switching block in the tracks which is not quite set properly?  The train rattles along the tracks intent on its destination, not realizing that it's wheels will soon be diverted to another track, or thrown off the track entirely.  Hi, my name is Ryan.  I'm on that train.   Last night, after watching a movie, my closest friend and I started discussing my upcoming job.  It's a conversation we've been having a lot lately, since my starting date is rapidly approaching.  I'm a bit nervous, a lot excited, and I realized last night, a little apprehensive.   This will be my first "real" job after graduating from college.  It's a good job.  It's with a good company. It's designing web software for a bank, and it isn't at all what I saw myself doing with my life. That scares me.   I always envisioned myself doing something really creative with computers, something artistic.  Computer graphics or animation or design.  Oddly though, I also wanted to write code.  I didn't want to be only on the creative end; I actually enjoy writing programs.  I wanted my carrier to involve using computers to tell a story.  Writing code, designing art and characters, and maybe even writing scripts, to entertain people  to make them think and feel and add a little bit to their lives.  That isn't the direction that I seem to be going.   I'm not usually the kind of person that settles.  I know that I want what I want and I won't be happy with less.  Luckily I'm learning to be patient as I get older, but ironicaly learning patience takes patience.  Still, I feel that I may be settling by taking this job.  Not that I think the job is beneath me  quite the opposite in fact, I expect it to be challenging  but I feel that I'm settling on less than my dream job. So many people I have come to know say that they started their current jobs after college expecting it to be a stepping stone to their dream job, only to find themselves still in the same position seven years later, ten years, fifteen.  Isn't that what  I'm  doing?   I'm on that train in the movie.  I know where I want to go. The track I want looks rough but is heading in the right direction. The other track looks smooth and straight but diverges. I can see that the switch is set to the wrong track.  The handle that sets the brakes has snapped off in my hand and I'm standing there stunned, sweating. This train  will  hit that switch. I can't go back.  I can't jump off.  All I can do is look ahead for another fork in the tracks, another choice, and wonder if I'll have the courage to make it.
