I don't like the fact that my civil rights are being compromised with the invasion of my  urlLink privacy , and yet the government's is being  urlLink protected .  I think that really, REALLY sucks, and I think many people are oblivious to that, or don't realize the implications of it.  So lay into me, all of you.
