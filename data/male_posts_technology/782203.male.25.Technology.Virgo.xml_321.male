Me  : How much did you get that cup of coffee for ?  Him : Ten dollars.  REALLY ANNOYING.   And also another time I missed the name of the person in a conversation a group of friends were having so I asked the person who they were talking about. He replied "The cleaner".   Like I said, some people should just stay away from jokes.
