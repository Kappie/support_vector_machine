I think the first movie had a better story line and good action scenes... this one had a weaker story line but kick ass action scenes and from the trailer Revolutions looks like its gonna rock too.  Aint played the enter the matrix game yet, does look well cool tho. Im still currently playing X2 Wolverine's Revenge or Midnight Club 2, keep flicking between them.
