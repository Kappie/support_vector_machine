So I opted for the stationary bike for my 20 minute cardio workout.  Treadmill 5 minutes  Stretch Shoulder pull 10 reps Shoulder pull down 10 reps (bar NEVER goes behind the head) Shoulder pull 10 reps Shoulder pull down 10 reps Bicep curl 10 reps Sit-ups 10 reps Bicep curl 10 reps Sit-ups 10 reps Stationary bike 19 minutes on level 2  		1 minute on level 3 Stretch  Post Workout notes: I was feeling OK after the workout. I was very hungry so I grabbed my lunch and headed back to my office. Then it hit me. My right knee is not happy and my arms and hands are a bit shaky. Must be due to the curls. Also just as I sat down, I got the feeling like water had gone up my nose. Sometimes I would get this feeling just before having a nose bleed. It kinda freaked me out since my Dad got a nasty nose bleed one time while I was at the hospital due in part to his blood pressure. Now I know when I have it check that my BP is fine but those family fears still have a way of sneaking up on me.   I also remembered part of the reason I stopped working out with weights. My Mom told me that my legs, arms and shoulders were getting too big and that it would be harder for me to find clothes. Just think of the power I gave to just one sentence from my Mom.  --- Posted via email
