While I'n not as fit and definately not as good as some of the others, I'm less embarassing then some people too.  A quiet refreshing beer afterwards to catch up on who fell down and who scored is always good fun.   Some friends, Bush and Raphael came back to the house and with my flat mate I made a "classic" punjabi curry.  Despite my usual tendency to cook things to death and for a long time, I manage to get everything done in half an hour.  All I did was chicken, lentils and rice in a basic tomatoe sauce.  I didn't have any coconut milk which is probably a good thing as I'm a sucker for it.  So we munch, get drunk and Paul and I head to our [seperate] beds at about 11.  A nice relaxed evening.  Which is a hell of a lot better this morning.  I come into work with nothing but people flapping about.  Some new software was deployed.  Do I have anything to do with it?  Barely, but it's up to me to liase with contractors and users and get everything sorted out [sigh].  Nothing went right.  Eventually everything is looking good and users are content for the moment.  I thought I would go out for a nice ride on my bike at lunch.  The weather wasn't looking too bad and I could destress a little by peddling my worries away.  I went and cycled around all of Abingdon which is about a 30-40 minute trip.  I was halfway through, in a suburb called peechcroft when I heard the sounds that all bikers dread [apart from the screech of car tyres] .. .. .. phut-sssssssssssssssssssssssss.  I managed to catch a flat at possibly the furthest point from my house and work.  So I managed to come back late to work with a flat tyre and need to walk it home after work.  Some days it's just not worth getting out of bed this morning.
