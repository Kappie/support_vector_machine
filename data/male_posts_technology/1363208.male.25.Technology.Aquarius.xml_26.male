Finish the ICT modules, ICT training (as if I don't know what to teach), etc.    Sunday: Jaga booth masa exhibition. I hate this. I really hate this.   Saturday (my own plan that has been taken away): See my sister, Didi.   Sunday (my own plan that has been taken away): Kayak!       What to do now?
