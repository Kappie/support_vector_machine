Mainly update the blog :(  I've added a link to Nyx's music blog on the left.  Good reviews of great music choice.  Just got back from visiting my sister in Ottawa for Canada Day.  Wish we had fireworks like those here in Barrie! Wow!    We also went to Montreal.  Guess we should have checked out what was going on, most of old Montreal was shut down due to a music festival and we ended up driving around the city for 3 hours.  Got to see St. Joseph's Oratory (hope that's the right name) up on the mountain, some of old Montreal and the outside of Notre Dame Basillica.  It closes at 4:30 in the summer for some sound  light show.  Drat, was hoping to get in there. Oh well.  A great trip all around.  Thanks Sis!
