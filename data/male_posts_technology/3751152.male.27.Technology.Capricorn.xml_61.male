Then when there was an unexpected pause to be filled during the meeting, I was asked to give a presentation I had not prepared for...I managed to wing it of course.  At least spending the day in the meeting brought about an invitation to go to dinner with our guests from Italy. Only problem is I left my Passport back in Switzerland.  Now I don't need a passport to get from Switzerland where I live to Liechtenstein where I work, but I do need one to get to Austria where dinner was to be had.  Thus, I made a mad rush back to Switzerland and spent a hectic 20 minutes trying to remember where I had put my passport. Finally it was found next to my laptop..and off back to Liechtenstein and eventually to dinner.  At least 40 euros of food and wine and dessert were consumed..so I guess it was worth letting my salad go spoil in the refrigerator at home.  More mixed news with respect to the opposite sex. I got an acceptance for a lunch date, but the girl has now invited half a dozen people to come along..so its become a party almost..she even has included th girl I asked to play tennis with me later in the week. I gotta watch out..my world is getting too small!
