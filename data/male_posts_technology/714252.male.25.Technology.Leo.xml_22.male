Went to Capitol first (Tables booked upstairs.. Nice!) then to Reynards..  Had a great boogaloo on the ole' Dance floor and met a really nice girl :) so all in all a great night :)  Anyway all the party hearty fun has me wrecked today (and talking absolute shite) so I am going to leave it at that till tomorrow I think :)  Talk to you then..
