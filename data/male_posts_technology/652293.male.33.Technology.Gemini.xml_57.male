One study from Stephanie Rosenbaum presented at UPA 2002.  and a link to a  urlLink site  that tracks ROI postings on the Web.  Now on to the  urlLink IUSR  project from  urlLink NIST .  Also talking about the use of the Common INdustry Format for usability reporting.  Much of this is based on  urlLink ISO  standards (specifically ISO 9241).  Here's a  urlLink site  that is very descriptive about ergonomic standards.  Now talking about Card Sorting for the  urlLink usability.gov , of which Dr. Bailey is a contributor.  They created a program to randomize 20 decks of cards (each deck has 187 cards).  The participants put those cards in order and category which they thought was logical.  Pretty typical card sorting, but I would like to see the tool they created as the one  urlLink IBM  offers for free is not exactly user friendly (even though it helps with computing the data you gather from the card sort).  But then Bailey says that they used the IBM tool to create a cluster analysis.
