But I realised that these days it's difficult for morning runs because of work. Evening air isn't as fresh because of the recent haze and traffic on the roads.  My Kinokuniya 20% discount expires today. Kinda regret not going just now. I used one over the weekend and got myself a book, Secrets of the Samurai, by Oscar Ratte and Adele Westbrook. The same authors for Aikido and the Dynamic Sphere. Book was written in a similar style and it's not a pure Aikido book. Touches on the history, tradition, developments ets of traditional practices and arts. Also explains a bit about the philosophy of the Budo-kas then. Very very interesting.  I'm about finishing my book We Were Soldier, Once and Young soon. Damn tempted to read the Secrets of the Samurai next. But I figured I should probably start with Killing Pablo or Lord of the Rings next instead. LOTR is not an easy book to read for me because of it's language, background and the author's style of writing. I'll probably go onto Killing Pablo first. He was a head figure of a drug cartel which the CIA actually tried to take out. A lot of classified details in the book that makes the whole operation damn interesting. I guess the background of the story simply appeals to the policeman in me lah. Heh ...
