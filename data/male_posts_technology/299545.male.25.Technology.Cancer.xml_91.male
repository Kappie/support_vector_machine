The concert was at 7pm, and was 40 miles away. So, I left work at 5, the apartment at 5:30, and we packed a dinner to eat on te way. Plenty of time, right?   Think again.  The second great flood decided to come to the South Shore, and all of New England decided to come to the concert. Not a good combination. It took us three hours to get there, and then after a great concert (more on this later) it took us 90 minutes to get the half mile out of the parking lot. Though luckily only 40 minutes to get home after that.   Despite the long time in the car, it was an awesome evening. Even though we didn't get there till 8:40, the Counting Crows were only about half way through an amazingly long, great set. I forgot how much I like them -- I am definitely gonna have to pick up their new CD. At about 9:30, the finished up, and John Mayer came on about 10. Sadly, he only played for an hour, including an encore (sadly lacking in 83-ness). It was definitely a great show though, and it was wonderful to see how much Jen liked it.  The rest of the weekend was spent relaxing, catching up on sleep (I'm not used to this wakin' up early and workin' all day thing!!! ;-).  We did grab some dinner at  urlLink Redbones  in Davis. I had heard great things, but I was really disappointed. I am hoping that is was cause we went really early on a Sunday night and the cook was overtired or something, but based on the meal I had, I wouldn't go back. We shared a sampler meal which included Memphis, Arkansas, and Texas Ribs, and some Brisket --- the only thing that I would rate above a 5 were the Memphis ribs -- everything else was way dry and not very tasty. Oh well...I guess I was spoiled by our  urlLink trip  to  urlLink Memphis .  And then is was back to work today. I really like my job, and am amazed at how little I mind working fairly long hours. Today I worked 7am-6pm, which will be pretty typical, and it didn't seem long at all. I think it's cause more than any other job I have had, it is very collaborative (lots of work meetings with 1 or 2 other people) so I don't get bored sitting at my desk. And when I am sitting at my desk, I have a ton to do.
