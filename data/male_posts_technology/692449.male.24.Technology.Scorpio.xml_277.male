I'm writing two one is auto biographical crap and the other is a sci fi story that is also kind of cheesy however I'd like to improve my creative writing especially now that I have my laptop. There is nothing like sitting at a coffee house and having a mini world setup before you. I need to some serious self- examming and fix the parts that I find lacking. I also need to get back into shape. I'm thinking of joining a gym so that at least I'll have access to a couple machines.
