So, I just keep looking and trudging along at the current dead-end job. I've changed departments and finished my yearly review, which is supposed to be leading to a raise, but I'm not holding my breath.   urlLink Andre's car has been booted  by the lovely Metro PD, and mine is in the shop, so transportation options have shifted to the public realm. 90 degree weather and piss-poor air conditioning lead to repugnant experiences tainted with the miasma of hot and sweaty people's BO and their (and my own) irritation at the 150 people crammed into a railcar that holds only 70 people. One and a half hours to make a trip that should only take 30 minutes. Oh, and the redneck-come-to-visit-DC on the Metro yesterday was the icing on the cake. Drunk, and spewing forth (at the full-volume only possible by those whose threshold for throat pain has been nulled by liquor) political bombast (at least it was anti-Bush) to the disentertainment of all those around him (including me and Andre). Christ, it was annoying.  After carrying my 50 pound laptop bag all around the metro system, I was hot, tired, and very sore in my shoulders and neck, but Andre, unsypathetic, just bitched at me and made me angrier. By the time I got home, I began to realize that my heat+hyperthyroid problem was kicking in and I almost passed out. Thank you, Metro PD, thank you...
