This is true of just about everything in my life that falls into the category of the zeitgeisty. Right, and if it's zeitgeist I couldn't be the first, you're right, go to hell.  I tried to keep a journal once, and failed. Always thought an online journal would be nice, as I spend most of my life on or near a computer, but doing anything constructive with a computer seems like a chore when all you do falls under passive and inane online consumerism or videogaming.  Then when Howard Dean made millions for saying nothing and giant media conglomerates started allowing their underlings to do the same that pretty much killed my desire to blog--and I also HATE that term.  By and by my constitution was rocked by the knowledge that a friend who lives at the foot of a mountain with 40 year old phone lines and an AOL dialup account has his own blog. If you knew anything AT ALL about me you'd realize that I decided I needed a blog too and fast.  Keeping up with most people (i.e. those goddamned Joneses) is pointless for it's impossibility, but I've developed a deep need to at least keep up with the Kromers (my family FINALLY got satalite a scant few months before they; my parents live only a few miles closer to civilization at the foot of a totally different mountain).  Luckily I already technically HAD a blog as I had signed up for one in the hopes of getting a free gmail account or something--this one actually.  It will probably be a lot of nothing: existential dread and the horrors of having a job that may be rapidly turning into a career . . . and probably some metabloggical ramblings on the nature of blog qua blog  . . . . oh yeah, that sounds nice
