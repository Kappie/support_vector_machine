Kudos to her for turning down the Prime Minister's position that was hers for the taking. That position represents the world's oldest surviving civilization and must be occupied by an Indian. I am not sure what prompted her to take this decision, but I am bowled over by it. She is like a breath of fresh air in a country where power hungry demagogues are the order of the day. Like I mentioned in my previous blog, her stature has suddenly increased manifold in my eyes.  There seemed to have been quite a drama outside her house after she made the announcement. A picture is worth a thousand words. The picture of a man with a pistol pointed to his head threatening suicide sums up the congress party for me. That looked so foolish, it was not fit for a B grade hindi movie. Their slavish attitude towards the Nehru family is the party's fundamental weakness. It had able leaders like Narasimha Rao and Madhavrao Scindia. Narasimha Rao was sidelined and Scindia died in a tragic aircrash. But the congress still has promising young leaders, but they are not given a chance.  Our cabinet looks positively geriatric, with dinosaurs of the cold war like Natwar Singh and Mani Shankar Aiyer getting key ministries. The biggest disaster as far as I am concerned is that with Natwar Singh at the helm of foreign affairs, we can look forward to unimaginative policies. He will take our country back to the Nehruvian age of (yawn) Non Aligned Movement. All the good work of the last 5 years will go down the drain and we will be back to square one!
