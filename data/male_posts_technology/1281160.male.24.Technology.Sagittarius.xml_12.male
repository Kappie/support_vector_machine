In sportsman's victory skill is one of the factor...  But for scientist, artist, economist... etc... skill is the only factor...  Since South Africa didnt entered into the super six stage we cant say they didnt deserve world cup... similarly since Kenya entered into the semifinal we cant say they deserve the world cup....  Hope u all get me...  Ram
