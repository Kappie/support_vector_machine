I do not know how many of you would actually do it. But, I thought the information was priceless, hence am forwarding it to all my dear ones. think about it........  This will save your life, as life is not worth living without the eyes. During a recent visit to an optician, one of my friends was told of an exercise for the eyes by a specialist doctor in the US that he termed as 20-20-20." It is apt for all of us (and also guys who send many mails), who spend long hours at our desks, looking at the computer screen. I Thought I'd share it with you. 20-20-20   Step I: After every 20 minutes of looking into the computer screen, turn your head and try to look at any object placed at least 20 feet away. This changes the focal length of your eyes, a must-do for the tired eyes.   Step II: Try and blink your eyes for 20 times in succession, to moisten them.   Step III: Time permitting of course, one should walk 20 paces after every 20 minutes of sitting in one particular posture. Helps blood Circulation for the entire body.   Please circulate among your friends if you care for them and their eyes. Your eyes r mirror of your soul, so do take care of them, they are priceless.............
