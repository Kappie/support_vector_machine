Aha! I  KNEW  something was fishy with that story! It was just too cute, you know? Like a professional pilot (with tens of thousands of hours of flying experience) flying for one of the world's largest airlines would be dumb enough to ask, "Did I just see Air Force One?" over the radio? It sounded like a scene from a crappy Steven Segal movie.
