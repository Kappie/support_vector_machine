Seems blogger has established a means for people to host pictures on their network which would make it easier for them to be posted in blogs. Ah, maybe it is easier, who cares.      Duties for the week: Finish my nephews' swing set, correct complexities on two computer systems, exercise, save money  pack for Little Rock venture. Unexpected bills have hit kinda hard lately leaving my bank account in flames. If I didn't have a savings account...sheesh! Planning is a beautiful thing I suppose. For some reason everytime I miss a night service at church, a massive sleep overcomes me. I spend most of that evening in a restless, unnerving funk. Perhaps it is because i've trained my mind to ward against such people and their popular fair-weather attitudes. In either event, i'm about to go outside  do...something.      One thing I will say about last week, even though it had its ups  downs, I felt madd sxxy the whole time :p
