The US and its allies went in to Iraq thinking that their army would be welcomed with open arms as they were freeing the Iraqi people from the evil regime headed by Saddam Hussein.  It must have never crossed their minds that dropping thousands of bombs on their cities would have scared and angered the people of the country.  The US did easily defeat the official Iraqi army, but the so called "insurgents" (i.e. soldiers out of uniform) are impossible to fight with the current military tactics.  The main problem with the insurgents is that they look exactly like civilians, but for the US to have a media-friendly war they cannot kill innocent civilians.  The civilians have to declare themselves combatants before the US can fire on them, and the declaration is usually made with heavy explosives or gunfire.  This means that one Iraqi can take out 2 or 3 soldiers before they start fighting back in most cases.  From a simple numbers perspective that is a huge disadvantage, nevermind the psychological disadvantage that the US soldiers face.  To win an invasion, the invading army must take complete control of the country.  That involves winning regions of the country a few at a time, flying flags in the won areas and keeping a forceful presence in the regions that have been conquered.  The US does not do that.  They leave each city once they assume it is conquered.  The insurgents rebuild their equipment, find new recruits and start fighting again.  You never see the US flags flying because they are trying to demonstrate that they are liberators, not invaders (a complete fallacy).  Although the flags are merely symbolic they demonstrate to the people that the country is no longer under the old government and that they have lost.    There are two options that the US has to fix the mess they are in now:  They can mount a major offensive on the whole country costing many civilians thier lives and decisively conquer it, or they can pack up and go home.  Anything else that they try will remain a complete failure and will cost thousands of lives.  War is a always brutal and disgusting thing, that is the way it has to be.  A media-friendly war will always fail.
