People just stare blankly at their screens without looking away, even when someone sits besides them. I guess things change over time.   On a happier note, I am going to watch Kill Bill later with a friend at Bugis, on a big ass screen somemore (well it better be big ass cos it has seats up to row X!). Really looking forward to it cos I am like the biggest fan of Pulp Fiction, one of my all time fav movies.  But I am wearing a new shirt that seems kinda tight around my massive biceps ...ok ok flabby upper arms happy! Hmm it didn't seem so tight when I bought it.
