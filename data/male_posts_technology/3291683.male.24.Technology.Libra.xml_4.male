       
      I was just playing around on Terraserver, on Microsoft's site, and found aerial photos of both my current house where I live with my wife now, and my parents' house.  They're both from 1995; I have no clue who was living in my house then, but in '95, my parents, sister and I were living in my parents' house.  Kinda nifty, knowing that there was a good chance of my being in the house on that day.  I could even make out the little blob that was probably my pool.  I mean, the resolution wasn't great (1 pixel to 1 meter, I think?) but it was enough to see the roads, the roof, things like that.  Nifty feeling.  Makes me wonder what else I should go and look up...  But either way, I probably shouldn't look them up from work, no matter how bored I am at the moment.  Lets see...  It's 2004 now...  I guess I would have been in senior year of high school then?  Not an unreasonable guess.  I'll have to re-check the date and figure it out, because now I'm really curious.  Heck, maybe I was in the pool when that picture was taken.  :)  Yup, right now I'm just sitting here waiting for someone to give me something to do.  I have two issues and a job ticket, but they're all waiting on someone else, so I'm pretty much just bored out of my mind.  I mean, I guess most people would like to not have enough work to do and rightfully just sit here, but I'm bored.  I can't do too much, so I end up surfing, and that doesn't amuse me as much as I'd hope.  Andy and Kristy and I have decided to bite the bullet and let them use two characters for the campaign.  It'd be better if we simply had more players, but with only two characters it's very hard to make encounters survivable.  They have only a modicum of firepower, but no magical support, no healing...  Just difficult to not overwhelm them or make the encounters hopeless.  So, they're going to be making a second character each.  It'll end up being something very close to a boring traditional party (rogue, ranger, cleric, wizard), but it'll at least be far more functional than just a rogue and a ranger wandering around.  In theory, I guess, they should have high enough hide and move silently skills to get around, but they're just too low level, at the point where luck can still throw it off very easily.  Their equipment is poor, they have no support, they have trouble with relatively simple tasks...  Just because of lack of numbers and resources.  Frustrating for me.  My garage is progressing.  It's taking forever to strip all the paint off of it, but I'm hoping I can bum a power sprayer off of someone so that actually re-painting it afterwards will be much faster.  The back door is done; the kitchen window we've started, but half gave up on; the basement windows are rotten, and need to be re-framed; and the ceiling of the back porch we've stared at really hard.  Darn paint doesn't fall off under staring, even my wife's.  *grumbles*  Why couldn't the seller have done this?  Or why couldn't the state have said "Well, if the buyer really doesn't care, lets leave it alone!"  I suppose it wasn't the state...  I think it's federal laws that cover this inspection.  My subscription to Planetside officially expires today, and I'm not renewing it.  It's a fun game, but is it really $13 per month fun?  Hard to say.  The past week and a half, I haven't played at all, but I played a bunch the two weeks before that.  I guess I'll just revert to Diablo II for my *cough* copious spare time.  That, or sleeping.  I might have to pick between them the way things are going right now.  My eyes are having a very bad day, all things told.  Yesterday was great: I got both contacts in on the first try for the first time since I started wearing them again (I wonder if I was wearing contacts back in 1995?  I think I had reverted to glasses by then)...  They felt good all day...  No noticeable problems of any kind.  Today, though, they were a pain to put in, they've been running very dry all day, I got shooting pains in one of them at one point (still don't know why), and they've been itching like crazy.  The wife suggests allergies.  I figure they're mad at me for some reason; no clue why, though.  It's gotten to the point where my glasses are uncomfortable and the (fairly small) difference in prescription gives me a headache; so it's difficult to wear them in the evenings, now.  I find myself wanting to wear the contacts longer, as long as possible, to avoid that; but tonight isn't looking hopeful.  Yesterday, one of my friends wanted help with a Tic Tac Toe AI for some random project.  I think I'll go work on that now, and see if I can't write something up to e-mail to him, in hopes of it not being too late.  I don't know VB, so I can't code it for him, but if I can get the algorithm written, he should be able to do it himself.  Serves him right for writing in VB instead of C# or Java; now he can't get me to do his assignments for him.  Unless it's more for fun than for an assignment.  I really don't know.
