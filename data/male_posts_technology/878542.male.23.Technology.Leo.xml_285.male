The prices on both of these are pretty unpleasant to think about, but... this is about what you need to build arbitrary things over the internet. Now all we need is a one off chipfabber, and we'll be completely vulnerable to any decent machine intelligence with apirations of replication.   heh. This reminds me of my old attempts to design a macroscale self-replicating robot. It required enouch exotic initial design that I think it's not possible yet, but getting close.   all I need is one and some desert, sand, dirt, sunlight... it's a magic moment indeed.
