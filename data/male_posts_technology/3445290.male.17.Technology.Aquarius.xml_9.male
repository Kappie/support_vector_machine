Its exam time, for students that tend to leave everything on the backburner like me are now making sure we know our stuff and handing in all our missing assignments in the last two weeks of school. This is the most stressful time of the school year where you miss a lot of sleep and study all night and wake up really early just to refresh your memory because these exams pretty much make you or break you in your future education and career.     I myself have to do quite well in my final exams because I consider myself a average student in everything except technology sciences such as computer science so I have to do well on my other finals or else I may be lying at a "c-" or possibly even a "I"(fail) if I do really bad on either my math or socials exam. Ontop of my final exams I also have my provincial exams which are completely new to me but I know they are used to compare schools all across British Columbia which will most likely be quite hard.      Last but not least I also have to take a extra class during the summer to graduate on time such as physics(cause I plan to get my electricians ticket) or math since I was taking a easier version of math when I was younger since I was so lazy.  ****Anyways this whole week is going to be extremely busy for me because I have to make flyers for a new store in surrey, Help a friend put up a neon sign at the mall, work out, do door to door sales, and study and do homework like crazy. So as you can see this week is going to be pretty insane with expectations coming from all over the place.**
