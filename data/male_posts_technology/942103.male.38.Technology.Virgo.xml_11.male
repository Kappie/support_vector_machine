It's a commentary about technology that I think hits the nail on the head:   Most people: "this is not working, I will call someone to fix it." me and You: "This is not working. Why? What if I tried this? Maybe if i do this? Let me see if the help menu can help me. Let me check out the support page on the web. Ok. Now I'm stumped. Where's the phone?"  I blame dependency on technology. We're taught to use a calculator, but not how to add or subtract. We're taught how to use our computers, but not how they operate.  We don't need to know these things, because somewhere out there a computer or machine can do it for us.     Heather is perceptive.  And she rocks.
