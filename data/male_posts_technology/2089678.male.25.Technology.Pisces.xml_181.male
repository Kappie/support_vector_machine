The culprit? of course malicious codes that are running behind without your knowledge, known as SPYWARES. More than Viruses and Worms, I am afraid of this stingy thing which is eating my bandwidth, security and privacy like hell.   In search of a hero to kill this monster, I discovered 2 excellent tools viz.  urlLink SpyBot Search and Destroy  and  urlLink SpyWare Blaster . Both are amazingly good and FREE, but still not 100% safe.  My hunt is still ON. I request you guys in the community to come forward and  POST YOUR COMMENT  regarding your experiences to deal with it and the tools that you know could help me safeguard my safety and privacy.  PS: Of course enabling FIREWALL protection is a good way to prevent security risks, I am looking for tools which can detect and remove the spywares.
