The trip started with a twist as I transferred planes in Utah to go to  urlLink Missoula  and found out that I was on a plane headed to Kalispell, Montana.  It was okay though because one half hour later and a new flight crew we were off to Missoula.    It was great spending time with Ann.  She was able to get itme off and we had a great time.  We climbed  urlLink the M  , walked along the  urlLink river , and went to  urlLink Hot Springs  to soak in the mineral water.  The best was just hanging out with Ann.  I learned how to play a couple different versions of dominos and how to make baked ziti.  It was fun.  It was fun to get a break from normal day to day stuff.    While I was away the Cats lost in the big dance and the Reds lost their opener.  I was able to watch the game on TV, but had to turn it off in the 8th because they looked bad.  I will get my pictures from te trip developed and on the web soon.
