I wouldn't mind but this is the last free weekend I'll have in a while I want to be out enjoying it.  Yesterday we wrote some thank you cards. Kirsten worked on the garden and I bottled my latest batch of  urlLink beer . In the evening Anna and Jon came around for dinner. I made a lasagne, for the first time, and it was good fun. I'd not been feeling too great all day and was exhausted by bed time.  This morning K felt ill and stayed in bed. I was stewarding at church and as usual I was put on car parking. We(I) messed up giving out the buckets for the offering but it was ok. After church I dropped some firewood around to Liz and dropped off K's keys while I was there. Liz wasn't in but I saw paddy through the back door as I left the wood.  I don't feel that great myself. Might be time to join K in the sick bed.
