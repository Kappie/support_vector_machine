I like that word and the connotations that you receive upon hearing or saying it.  I see things on a daily basis that just make me shake my head and say ..hmmmm..  or more often "What the hell is wrong with you!".  This is my Blog.  And so this is the place for my rants and or raves, take them as you will for they may be "Incautious" from time to time.
