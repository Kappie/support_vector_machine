I was worried that Nick's ride to the Mission Monday thing was going to get messed up, so I sent an email to the Uth coordinator to make sure he's giving Nick a ride.  All is well and Nick has plans for the day.  He'll get home before me, but we should get home about the same time.  BANK OF AMERICA is the shittiest bank on the planet earth.  After having an account for only 2 weeks, they've managed to charge me $37 in fees and bounce my car payment even though the money was in the account.  Some bullshit about a 5 day bank hold.  I'm closing my account.  They can shove it up their ass!!!  I ain't spending more money to spend my money.  Crappy bank, crappy bank.  Got dinner, pork chops and broccoli and got Nick to band practice.  Spent the rest of the evening watching the home run derby on espn.  Went to bed at eleven.
