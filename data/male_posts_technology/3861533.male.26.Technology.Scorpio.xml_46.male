Fights between students and between students and the faculty. This type of movie just isn't for me. Underdeveloped characters and a non-existent story. Instead there are a lot of fights. I would have liked it more if they had removed a lot of the action and put more focus on the romantic subplot and the interplay between the rival student groups... but that would have made it into an almost completely different movie.  The only actor I recognised was the lovely  urlLink Shin, Min-a  that I last saw in  urlLink Madeleine  (see  urlLink previous post ).  -->
