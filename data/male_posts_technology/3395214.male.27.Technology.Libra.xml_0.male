By reclaiming the time and space in your life to pursue your own priorities and dreams, you become more available, not less. Use the power that's rightfully yours. To the best life you can envision, say yes!"                                                                                                                                                             - Patti Breitman       YOUR `can-do' attitude has gotten you where you are today- professionally secure and content. But then, suddenly you find yourself in a spot. You know that saying `yes' can be disastrous, while saying `no' is unimaginable! Why is it that you have such a hard time saying no? Believe it or not saying `no' is an effective management tool. For whatever reason -- moral, financial, and political or for the sake of your own career advancement -- you must be able to say `no' somewhere to someone. The earlier you learn it, the better it is for your career and your company. Saying `No' ain't so bad and doing it right will keep you on a roll!    Some classic instances that we come face to face in our day to day lives:    Employees    A star employee comes up to you with a proposal. While it could be a great one, it might not be the best option in the prevailing circumstances. So this calls for you to say the dreaded `no'.. .   Tread gently, but don't back out or buckle under the strain. While turning down his proposal, make a commitment to him that you will get back to him when the right time comes. Also make sure that he understands why you couldn't action his proposal. Leave no room for misgivings to mar the relationship.    Superiors    As a manager you don't have to always say `yes' to your superiors. Your superior may appreciate it when you recommend a strategic decision. But you're likely to get his undivided attention if you don't endorse a decision taken by him. Especially, if it's backed by relevant facts as to why the decision could backfire. Even the best boss can make a mistake. So if by saying `no' you bail him out of a sticky situation, you would have earned your raise.   When things don't work out your gumption in saying `no' will vindicate your stand.    Clients    When in business, you have to do everything you can to get and keep your clients. You may have to put up with undue pressure from the client time and again. This may be due to last moment change in requirements, Design Mismatch, short deadlines,  24*7 expectation from the client when the contract doesn't say so, Sufficient time not provided for Testing and the likes of them. You've got to say 'NO', assertively and not aggresively, to get your point accross until both you and the client come up with a proper working base, that is a perfect solution to both. Keep your client happy by keeping him rightly informed and not making false commitments.   If your decision goes against the collective opinion then call for a meeting of all the concerned people and explain why, what you are doing is in the best interests of the company terms of money and resources.
