I came to know Shakespeare, Bram Stoker, H G Wells, Jules Verne etc. through these excellent publications. These books were published in English and Malayalam. If I remember correctly, 51 of them were published. This post is my tribute to the creators behind this. I am tabulating all the 51 editions below.
