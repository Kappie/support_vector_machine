Any private company with the balls to predict a permanent station at 130,000 feet with industrial capability, well, I just have to meet this guy.   Looks like it's mostly volunteers. That gives me some hope, as to how much can be done without funding.   I love their nomenclature.  I'm going to investigate this a bit, I've always been fascinated by Buckminster Fuller's Cloud 9 idea. I have no idea whether it would really work or not. maybe these people would know.   I wonder if they've investigated tetrahedal truss structures for dirigibles.
