I think I played my cards right for the most part.  I over bet a few times and that hurt me more than anything else.  It's always my betting that gets me in trouble.  I'm starting to see a lot of the same people too.  That helps to get a feel for some of the players.  This is it for awhile.  I'll be on vacation until June 7th, so I won't post again until then.  I'll be playing a lot of simulations on my Wilson programs though.    Indiana Slim
