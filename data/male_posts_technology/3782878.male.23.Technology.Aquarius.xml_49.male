Turned out today was not in fact Wednesday, which Akcron so lovingly pointed out, but Thursday! my 10-6 shift! this has been the 3rd or fourth time in this week that I've been late to work, I kinda dread the paperwork that would be imposed by my company for this. Now sometimes they do not catch these things, and I may get lucky enough not to see paperwork, but needless to say something needs to change in my house and I need to turn over a new leaf of coming in on time everyday. that and I need to remember what day it is before I set my alarm.  Anyway, work hasn't been too hectic today, but getting up the energy to write my blogs has been an effort lately, hopefully I'll be able to catch them up tomorrow while I'm off. Look for more as it happens. I'll probably also start on my Website project this weekend, I've got some preliminary site designs in mind, but I'm just learning CSS, so it may take some time to iron out all the cross-compatibility wrinkles.  Try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix
