Do you think they are a sign of sluttish lack of grooming, or are they an enticing hint at a bountiful bush?    I had a near death experience in Indiana over the fourth of July and while I didn't meet any spirit guides or come away with any wisdom concerning the hereafter, it did bring up the question of pubic grooming.  I went rowing on a lake and nearly drowned  because I had been wearing overalls but they were so heavy I couldn't swim in them, so I had to take them off or sink. A storm was kicking up over the lake and the waves were huge.  My puny arms were tired from unaccustomed rowing and the fucking dungarees must have weighed at least 50 pounds soaking wet.  Plus because they were baggy the drag was incredible.  I could barely keep my head up. I had to be fished out in my underwear by a fat old Hoosier on a pontoon boat.  When I rose, dripping, and collapsed on the pontoon, I looked down there they were, in all their glory--curly,friendly, peeking out and not in the least phased.  I don't know what the Hoosier thought. Let's hope he was distracted by my cleavage, or by his trick knee, or by the approaching tempest, but *I* was all too aware of their presence, and while coughing up water I kept thinking, shit, I should have shaved for this.
