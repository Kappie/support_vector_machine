Silence...   Found this from an amusing article called 'How to... study' in yesterdays Gurdian. "Studying is copying things from books, and revising and highlighting the nouns what you have copied. But remember, your teacher probably wrote the book you're copying from, though when you've reduced his life's work to one noun, he might not recognise it."  urlLink How to... study   What did I do today? Well this morning myself and Andy went skiing! But just before that we played with his ferrets, they are soooo smelly! But quite cute. The skiing was very good, soon as Andy worked out how to turn he was fine. Then this evening my family and I went to my grandparents for a meal and to talk about stuff such as house prices. Did you know that a 3 bedroom house in the year 1976 was £17,000? How much did your last car cost? Crazyness.  Anyway, my view on war if it has been said already there is no need to say it again. But seeing has everything has been said I want to say, I bid you good night and sweet dreams - I'm going to have a bath.
