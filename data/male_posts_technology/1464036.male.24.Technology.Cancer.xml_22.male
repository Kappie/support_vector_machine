Her engagement ring was stolen and today we had flooding.  NOT FUN.    The current management has been a little decent, but the previous management (4+ months ago) was rude, selfish, and very inconsiderate.  Go check out  urlLink Apartment Ratings.com  and see that I'm not the only one that doesn't like our complex.  ILY
