We searched the bed as i was getting ready for work but to no avail no bug insite. Charlene forced roxy this morning to sleep in the bedroom this morning b/c of her interest in sleeping on the futon.  I drove to work today going a little too fast this morning  and almost clipped a car. It had to have been a millimeter apart from the next car. wheeww that was a close one. I called Charlene back once i got to work and asked her if she was trying to sleep. She said she was with the tv turned off thankfully. She's going to call David back for an interview with Spherion.
