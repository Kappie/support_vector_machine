Hatch's "logic" to another industry, automotive.  Any company that builds a car which can travel faster than 75 mph and markets it in the USA may be violating the law.  Certainly if that company shows commercials of these vehicles traveling at higher than legal speeds, they are "inducing" me to copy that behavior.    Of course the advertisement will contain a disclaimer about how you shouldn't copy this type of driving.  But Kazaa also carries a disclaimer that says you shouldn't do anything illegal with their software.  The really ludicrous part of Hatch's argument is that he is the one exploiting the children for his own political purposes.  If his argument was sound he wouldn't have to resort to the age old tactic--the same one Miletus used in accusing Socrates--of corrupting our children.  Don't dismiss Sen. Orrin "Miletus" Hatch outright.  Remember, Socrates lost his trial.
