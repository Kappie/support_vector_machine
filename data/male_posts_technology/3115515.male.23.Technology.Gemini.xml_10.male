I FINALLY finished the Stock Web Animation for that movie gig I'm working on.  It literally tooks me 10 hours of straight work, but it's finally done.  Life is pretty good right now, I can't complain.  My parents are going through a small law suit, but I think we are going to end up winning (although we are paying $400 a second it seems).  I got a chance to catch up with a lot of my old friends this past weekend.  My Friend Kimmy had a graduation party on Saturday, so I saw a bunch of people there.  We all promised we'd stay in touch but you know how that can go sometimes :).  I'm really going to try.    Also Congrats to Niki for a great performance on Thursday night! She's gonna do real good on the Music Circuit.
