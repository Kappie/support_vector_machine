All of them could play quite well! And i think it was the one badminton match where i got home with the most aches. Now i have aches on my arm and wrist and my right leg. Now even trying to type properly..hehe..anyway, look forward to playing with them again...too bad none of them know how to play tennis..:(  Today has been quite fulfilling for me. I think in the morning i finished setting up the online library catalog for the church website. Then in the afternoon after lunch i went out to get a badminton racquet. Before lunch i had rummaged through the storeroom searching for those old badminton racquets i had. I knew all of them had the strings broken so i thought of restringing it. But when i took them out, i saw that they were rusty. So i thought it's no point to restring it. I might as well buy one brand new one and call it my own. So i went to Queensway shopping center. Once i reached there, i went to DBS to cash in a cheque. Wah i had to queue for quite some time...about 10 minutes..so when it got to my turn, the bank girl told me there's this new plan called life savings plan. She said i can get a higher rate of interest if i sign up for this plan. So she took me to one of those cubicles for further explanation. Actually another girl attended to me. When we first met, she extended her hand for a handshake...wah so formal har? i was thinking..i just came here to know more about the plan only mah. So she told me the minimum sum was $100. Cut a long story short, i told her i'll come back once i get a stable job. And then she extended her hand again, then bo pian gotta shake her hand....need to be so formal meh?...weird.. Anyway, i got this super cool badminton racquet for only $55! It's titanium and the design and color is so cool. And it's very light!! My father held it when i got back home and fir st thing he said was "wah so light"...hehe...good thing i went to the right shop because the salesman was very knowledgable and recommended me this racquet. It's a Gosen racquet. I haven't heard of the brand before..only know Yonex..but then he said that Gosen is well known by Malaysians and Japanese..oh well...so i took it..good price too coz the other shop was selling at more than $70. Anyway, i'm very happy i have my own personal badminton racquet..along with 2 personal tennis racquets..hehehhe..the POWER of owning more things..hehe.
