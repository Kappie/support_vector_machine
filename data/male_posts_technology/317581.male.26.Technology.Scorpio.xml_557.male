It could be do to the sweltering heat, or the fact that I just got home from a rowdy night of board games. I need to figure out what I'm doing in my life. I know I am a hard worker, and can excell at any given task, it's just I need to decide what that task will be. Also, I need to decide if I want to sell my car.  Well, now is not the time to decide these things. I'm going to bed. Peace- T
