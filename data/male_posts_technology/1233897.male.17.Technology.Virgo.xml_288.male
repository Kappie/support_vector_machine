It was really neat, his dad's one of the worship leaders at Harvest (their church), and led worship for the service.  Brandon got up and spoke for a bit; it's amazing how well he's taking it all. He's much stronger than, well, almost anyone I know'd be in his situation.  Afterward, several seniors and I went out to Red Robin for linner ... or dunch... (Why isn't there a word for lunch/dinner, but there's brunch?) They're such a great group of people... wish I could spend more time with them.
