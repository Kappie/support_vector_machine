When I left the cinema I wasn't quite sure wether or not I had just stepped out into some other, new and perverted world! It wouldn't be an understatement if I said my mind has been even more corupted by the content of this film, Johnny Depp sporting an unusually astounding cockney accent, Heather Graham wearing a totally outstanding push up dress ( which lets be honest, wasn't really needed), Robbie Coltraine playing yet another police seargent and the most disturbing thing..................... fucking BILBO BAGGINS going out on killing escapades, murdering and mutilating whores left, right and center!!! Can you imagine if all hobbits were like good old Bilbo? The 'Shire', full of little evil murderous pecks that run about in the night, looking for another 'Unfortunite' midget!! Anyway go and see the film if you still want to and remember to make sure you take a packed lunch ha ha!
