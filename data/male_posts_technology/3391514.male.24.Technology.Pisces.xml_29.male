At the moment its very similar to Starship Troopers... I don't like the idea of armour-mounted lasers though.  The amusing thing is the date... 1997.  The authour admits its a bit fantastic, considering it was written in the seventies.  Picked up  UFO: Aftermath  today, but haven't tried it yet.  Also got a Robert Rankin novel and the 6th in the Resident Evil series.  In a bizarre switch from Monday, I actually slept until 12.35pm... I don't do that often either.  I reckon its nerves.
