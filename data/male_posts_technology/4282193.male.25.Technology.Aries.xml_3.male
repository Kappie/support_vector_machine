I can't get too much of a good thing. 40 days and nights of a deluge would be just about right.  I also like the way it conjures up images of an ancient era: the kind you can only explore if you're  urlLink Indiana Jones .  I was disappointed when I learned that it has a negative connotation: outdated, archaic, antiquated. Then again, as  urlLink Hallsey  could tell you, I like "old man drinks".  Next time it rains, I'll have to have a  urlLink Manhattan .
