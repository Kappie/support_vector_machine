I always think that my life is so boring that some time I wonder what's the point of writing it all down. I guess that strange things make you take some thing up and put them down again. I guess that the some thing that make you take up some thing is powerful enough to influence us to do some thing is some thing to take notice of.   So a new thing for me I guess is that I picked up a new author two days ago. The book I found on the free shelf was called "a prison diary", after 10 pages I was hooked on the book. I don't know what it was but the guy was a very very good writer. Today I was lucky to find several books on CD by the same author and I'm now listing to "Not a penny more, not a penny less" its a very very good so far.
