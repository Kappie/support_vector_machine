It seems that the guy who used to sit next to me rang the social suicider and told him the effect he was having on the footy tipping gods. Social boy paid his $22. Wow. Not so obstinant after all. Well done social boy. And well done to Fred too for ringing him up to explain the situation.  On a more personal note, I like to play with people's minds. With the hub-bub surrounding the guy who used to sit next to me I felt it was the perfect time to clean my desk. This should get tongues wagging. Fifteen years of clutter gone in two days.  I've already had the girls from across the cubicle wall pass comment on it. And the guy two rows down offered me some kit-kat. It was time for a break anyhow.  I even took down the poster from the first amateur film I made with the guys from work. It was a bit of a materpiece and the missing poster is bound to cause a stir.      Like I said, I like to play with people's minds.
