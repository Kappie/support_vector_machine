All I can say is "I should've kept my mouth shut." "You’re too good for me" she says. I disagree, I'm just being me is all. Darn, I wish I could talk/ask her what she meant by this. No, I think I should just leave it be. In the end I guess it will work out to where we’re both happy. "When you find something that works you don't look back," a saying by Zakk Wylde. I guess I could live with this...Something I wrote for her awhile back...  *MY CONFESSION* Two different people so close yet so far apart all the things you say and do Could you promise me? Would you keep your word? never letting it go I carry your love this never ending feeling it gets me through thinking about you everyday wishing you were here how I long to be in your presence so close by your side taking me higher and higher the feeling of a human touch seeing the comfort in your eyes the warmth inside your smile tears of joy falling but you can’t see I awake to quite nights this isn’t the first nor the last I can’t get enough of your love I just want to love you a prayer once whispered now answered one step closer forever and ever until the end you're all and everything to me you know we will always be I'm glad I found a friend in you  close your eyes between you and me tell me what’s on your mind?

Oh, there can be no other My ever constant fix For in the stream which drowns my sin Oh, there can be no other   Oh, could I be wrong, could I be wrong, oh no Oh, it's where I fear I belong Oh, I've lost myself along the way Oh, yeah, ain't got nothing left to say I've burnt my bridge to the past And I buried my broken bones How I long for what I once had known  Cinder blocks and chains Laid by the insane Oh, there can be no other Worthless to the core Diseased forever more Oh, there can be no other  Oh, could I be wrong, could I be wrong, oh no Oh, it's where I fear I belong Oh, I've lost myself along the way Oh, yeah, ain't got nothing left to say I've burnt my bridge to the past And I buried my broken bones How I long for what I once had known  Oh, could I be wrong, could I be wrong, oh no Oh, it's where I fear I belong Oh, I've lost myself along the way Oh, yeah, ain't got nothing left to say I've burnt my bridge to the past And buried my broken bones How I long for what I once had known How I long for what I once had known How I long for what I once had known  ...  Well I just finished playing the guitar. In one of my past entries I stated that it's been a while since I played the darn thing. I put in 30 minutes or so, mainly working on my speed and precision. It turns out I still kick@ss. Oh yea, I saw my friend Dennis of W.E.S. He gave me a flier of the "WINDOW ROCK FEST," and I told him that I would buy tickets from him at the end of next week. $30 dollars...The Navajo Times advertise it as $25, hmm. I think I'll be taking my lil brother, seeing that he's a hardcore music fan. Should be...Fun? Something worth checking out.   I'm listening to him play the guitar as I'm typing this entry(my lil brother). He's gotten pretty darn good...I guess that's what you get living and learning from the best :P. His style is a lot different from what I play. He's more into the hardcore metal stuff; Six Feet Under, Cannibal Corpse, Slayer, and the likes of them. While on the other hand I'm more on the side of Black Label music, Hard Heavy Rock. As he puts it, "we're pure iron...fuck that nu-metal shit..." :D  When I first started the guitar, about six years ago or so, I started by playing Metallica and Pantera stuff. First song I mastered was "Welcome Home Sanitarium." As I progressed through the years, my style changed. After Metallica and Pantera, I went on to the styles of Stevie Ray Vaughan and Jimi Hendrix. Then to Steve Vai, Joe Satriani...and to now present day Black Label Society, a.k.a. Zakk Wylde. Well these named are major influences, but there are others such as Eric Clapton, Eric Johnson, Yngwie Malmsteen, and so on.  Oh yea, I also play the bass and the drums. The bass I just recently started playing, going on two years or so now. The drums...hmm I've been banging the crap out of drums since the 7th grade. My friend Dennis taught me all that I needed to know as a beginning drummer, and I picked up the rest along the way through the years. I also play other percussion instruments. I started piano lessons, then stopped. I guess that's it on instruments that I can play...   The band I'm trying to start now, or want to start, will be in the style of BLS. Right now I have nine songs written and half of those nine songs I have the music on the guitar. Hopefully when I get out there, peeps will like my stuff. I was hoping to make a guest appearance during WES's set in Window Rock. I didn't get a chance to ask him when I saw him this past Friday. I feel that since he earned that spot why should I try to get in on his set. So I left it as is. Some day I'll have my chance.  ...Cool, just got done talking with Ana and everything is all good between her and I. I'm happy :D So all has turned out well. And here I was thinking something else and got a bit worried...something that had been on my mind all day long....
