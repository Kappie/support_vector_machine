I think that i make people smile, but...i dont see how that can be related to a career. Unless i'm a clown. Clowns dont get paid well. Especially Ass-Clowns. I couldnt become a pro-comedian, because there are times when I cant think of SHI* when i'm improving/reciting. Uh...If I was a doctor i would get sued for something or the other. I'd probably crack jokes about smoking/blondes to the blonde cancer patients...Yeah, i'm that odd. Hmmm...Anything else? I could become a webcomic artist, but that doesnt get the $. At all. Cept for piro, but he doesnt count. That lazy mofo. lol. I could become a pool cleaner. But i'd pour arsenic or cyanide into people's pools for fun...How about a psychologist? no...malpractice suit. I'd make fun of people on my lunch break. I'm sorry if I cant keep a straight face when someone tells me that they have a crooked penis (Yes, that was a reference from the movie "cheaters". Damn you Napplebee!!!). Or when they tell me that their wife wants in the @$$, and that they are afraid of diseases and such. Or when they tell me that their grandma beat them as a teenager (They could have fought back...Old lady...Take a baseball bat to her hip.) Or when they tell me that they are deathly afraid of TPS reports (Office Space Reference). Or their boss. Or if they tell me that they want to swim in a sea of penii (South park reference). Or when they tell me that their computer told them to follow the white rabbit (Matrix Reference. Duh.). Well, i'm going to stop this now. All of the fragments are giving me a headache. ....  Wtf? eric's doing pushups in the middle of my room. I'm scared...he was just taking a nap. Bye.
