NTK raised concerns  urlLink last week  over the way the media were tripping over themselves to cover the story in gushing, sychophantic 'save the children' mode. What is it about the mere mention of paedophilia that makes people believe whatever is fed to them?  urlLink Brass Eye  anyone?    Anyhoo - after blogger Cameron Marlow secured an  urlLink exclusive interview  ( urlLink full transcript ) with one of the bots it seems we either had a revolutionary advance in AI or some sort of cheating.    But it gets better - today  urlLink Waxy.org  have a piece about the author of the software - and his self-confessed mental problems, links to Holocaust denial postings he put on Usenet  the death threats he has made!    Coding - it's  the  profession of the mentally ill! I'm off to wrap my head in silver foil.
