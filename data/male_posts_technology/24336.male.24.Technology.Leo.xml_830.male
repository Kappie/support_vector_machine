I'm really started to get used to the upgraded audio.  The bass response is pretty cool and there is a fairly slick steering column (not steering wheel) based audio controller.  I will probably take a picture of it when I do a full photoshoot later.  Basically, it is stalk sticking out from the lower left area of the steering column.  It has a two-way switch for station seeking (while in radio mode) and track seeking (for CD mode), two buttons for volume control and a single button for mode which will switch between presets for radio mode and will switch CDs for CD mode.  I'm getting used to using it.
