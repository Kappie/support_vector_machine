What the hell happened to AMC they used to show old classics but now it seems like all they show are cheese movies from the 80s.  I even caught  Star Trek IV  there the other day and I saw a promo for  Porky's !  The original  Rocky  was great as ever.  It is a truly great film deserving of the Best Picture Oscar.   Rocky II  is pretty sucky at least until the end when Rocky goes back in the ring.  Rocky's powder blue leisure suit was pretty cool though.   Rocky III  is awesome its got  The Eye of the Tiger , Mister T as Clubber Lang, more Apollo, Mick's death, and the most home-erotic hug between to heterosexual men in cinema history. You can see a small picture of the infamous hug  urlLink here .     Rocky IV   is  jingoist crap but its brilliant jingoist crap!  Its got the Cold War, Ivan Drago, Apollo's death, James Brown, and a crowd of Commie Russians cheering for Rocky.  Its almost as good as Top Gun.   Rocky V  was not as awful as I had remembered it but it wasn't that good either.
