Reviews can be terribly subjective, so that's not necessarily the best barometer for quality.  On the other hand, I agree with the Warner Brothers in that the long list of shitty games based on movies really needs to stop, and definately hurts the brand (at least to some extent).  In any event, I gotta give a nod to the movie studios on this one.  They are at least attempting to address the problem.
