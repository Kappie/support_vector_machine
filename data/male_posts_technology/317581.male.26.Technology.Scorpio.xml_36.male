("Richard Ashcroft")  In the immortal words of Bob or Doug McKenzie("I can't remember which is which, but it's the one played by Dave Thomas")... "I'm taking you to the looney bin, then I'm going to the brewery, Eh?"  All in all, I think this life we live, isn't really predestined... Anyway, I found this poem today over at  urlLink Hangingon.org . and I thought it was really cool, so I thought I'd share it:  Sex Without Love by Sharon Olds   How do they do it, the ones who make love without love? Beautiful as dancers, gliding over each other like ice-skaters over the ice, fingers hooked inside each other's bodies, faces red as steak, wine, wet as the children at birth whose mothers are going to give them away. How do they come to the  come to the come to the God come to the still waters, and not love the one who came there with them, light rising slowly as steam off their joined skin? These are the true religious, the purists, the pros, the ones who will not  accept a false Messiah, love the priest instead of the God. They do not mistake the lover for their own pleasure, they are like great runners: they know they are alone with the road surface, the cold, the wind, the fit of their shoes, their over-all cardio- vascular health -- just factors, like the partner in the bed, and not the truth, which is the single body alone in the universe against its own best time.   Cahlen, that one's for you big guy, I hope you're having fun at work:)
