This unfortunate incident occurred in a small, unmarked sedan in New York City.  The deceased was reported to have shouted "Zounds!  I am undone!" just before expiring.  John Bynre is survived by a yellow lab named "Scurvy".  Funeral services will be held the 7th of next month.  Weird thing is.... How the hell did they know I was going to New York on that Date? NO seriously, no joke I'm going to New York on the 4th of September. Spooky!!
