I have been sort of dried of the Word Of God, partly because Couz Camp arrangements, Young Adults and of course work confirmations. Prepared the entire week just for 5 minutes on the phone with Darlene Kiola..aka Big Mama...of EA Consulting US. But Praise God, by His mercy and grace, I am saved and yeah got thru and confirmed for work. I mean I get a raise not by much and able to take leave...enjoy the benefits of a full time staff...  Yesterday was great, as I am serving together with Pure Joy which gives me satisfaction and rekindle the passion to serve in church as a cell. I am driven by that inner passion to arrange Simply United to serve in the same way ...not just once in a while but to serve consistently. Because faith must come with actions. It was great cause I really learned a lot from Pure Joy...the people with genuine passion with real struggles but equally real desire to please God. Then we had an all guys nite out simply because they are a few girls that turned our offer down..one going to Sydney today and another tired out from work...oh well ..God 's plan.  Then we hanged out in a truly truly awesome place where solitude, silence and serenity with a gentle breeze that blows by just enhanced the moment we share as all guys time...discussing our struggles with BGR...hehehe  But truly I believe that the ultimate love that we hunger for is not just the love of our future spouse..but really to experience more depths in the love of God. God 's love is patient, it is kind. it never boast, it ....as in 1 Corinthian 13. In fact it is uncompromising and it is unconditional.   This morning as i waked up, a new day, a new time, a new purpose and a new way to live out the day for Jesus. I viewed my work as not just work ...but a time to point Jesus to my collegues..a time to serve God and live my life according to His word. There are times when we fall, particularly when i drive can sometimes stumble other...cause i cursed or get even by cornering people  and it does not do justice to the Christian Stickers on my car . Pray for me. Don't get me wrong i am a careful driver and does not speed ..but there are times.occassionally....out of frustration with the traffic or just late for work.  Pray for me as I am currently rising up to God's challenge to coordinate prayer for COUZ camp and i am not your usual holy ..mighty prayer warrior...I am just believing to God for that...and will take my first few step by faith.  Reviews of Joshua Harris will come as i look into the second chapter by next week.
