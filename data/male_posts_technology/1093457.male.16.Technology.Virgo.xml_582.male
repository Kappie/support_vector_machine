Each morning my dad got up at about 6 to try and get a sunbed with an umbrella. Of course they had all already gone! So in the end he gave up and got up at 8 instead to get one without a umbrella. We visited Palma, the main town of Majorca, but it was an hour and a hlaf bus journey from where we staying! grrr. Our hotel was very nice, it had a big swimming pool, stage area, tennis courts, football courts, lots of shops, a burger bar, a pizzeria, a park, a volleyball bit and lots of bars. Also it was so close to the beach it took you about a minute to get onto the beach if you got out of the swimming pool! Erm... Didn't really meet anyone which was a bit annoying, but it didnt bother me too much as i was never bored. The simming pool had a slide! YAY I got my hair done again like last year. And the good thing was that it was 20 euros cheeper! Plus there were trampolines outside of the complex up the road so i was happy! I think i spent to much money on them though. well thats all i cant hink of to write at the mo so if u wat more details talk to me
