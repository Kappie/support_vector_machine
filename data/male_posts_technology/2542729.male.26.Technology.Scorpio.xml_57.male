On my part, as far as actually  doing  anything, i've done very little. Outside of cutting the grass, catching up with old schoolmates  going to church, its been blah. But its been truly emotional.  The life  times of Nikki  Ron have changed, changed back then changed again  now transformed into something very visceral,   \Vis"cer*al\, a. [Cf. F. visc['e]ral, LL. visceralis.]  2. Fig.: Having deep sensibility. very tentative yet...very binding. There isn't enough time in the day for me to cover all the bases but here are the basics.   The Good, The Bad  The Ugly   The Good She's still in love...i'm still in love... To my knowledge I haven't been replaced yet and this fire that has burned in my heart almost since day one burns brighter than eva now. I've never experienced anything so sensual and so daring  full of promise in my life! Its good to be alive, good to be in a loving, committed relationship....good to have loved  been loved in return...and truly it is better to have loved than never to have loved at all. That being said,  The Bad As all those who can read already know, Nikki  I are no longer together, citing personal development issues as being the core ruse for a split.  \Ruse\, n. [F., fr. OF. re["u]ser, rehuser, to turn aside, to shuffle, retreat It was fine with me, after a moment or twenty of meditation. It felt like all my feelings  all my soul was hung out on the clothesline to dry out completely. No reprieve, no nothing just the end of a journey that was supposed to last a lifetime but ended well short. It was foreign to me how two people who loved each other and had so much in common could not possibly find a way to stay together. Blah blah blah, more of the same on to  The Ugly I'm not going too hard into detail here. Just know that on this day app a week ago, something boiled over inside of meand I had to express it. Express it or live with it and I had to choose the right option. Too much was going by the wayside...too much was spilling away of our relationship, transformed into a friendship, that in its capacity may never work because my love is entirely too strong and I could never bear to see someone else.....take my place...which is in essence a whole other issue. Crap I feel like screaming....  Uglier Its about to throw down outside which is great I guess, if you're into southern humidity. We're not too far from the lake which doesn't help. I have plans to go to Tuesday night mens service @ church...a revelation that doesn't belong in the ugly column yet sits here because my revamped Jeep hasn't been rain tested since I sealed the sunroof leaks. I was drenched the last time it rained, good thing I had on work-type clothes.  Time to downloand movies while playing City of Heroes (again). Look i'm addicted arite! I admit there's a problem. At least I can say thaaat much :-p
