I had to choices  urlLink  The Spy Who Came In From the Cold   and  urlLink  The Warriors  .  I had been looking forward to seeing both for some time.  I figured I could watch both in one evening no problem.  I watched  The Spy Who...   first but it was a let down.  It was not nearly as taut or exciting as most other John LeCarre stuff that I've seen or read.  Next was  The Warriors  which has been a personal favorite ever since I as a kid.  But when I slid the DVD out of its sleeve the dice was split in two.  It sorta ruined my nice evening!  Damn you Netflix!  The replacement copy you send me tomorrow better be mint!  Or I'll... do nothing I guess...
