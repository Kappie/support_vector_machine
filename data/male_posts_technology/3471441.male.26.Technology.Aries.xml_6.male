I dunno what I'm gonna be doing during the flat spells, it's surprising we don't turn to drugs and inner-city crime. I start to itch after a few weeks without surf. Luckily for me I've got a holiday to look forward too, we're off to the Canaries for at least a week, maybe two, in September.  There is one little piece of good news though, I read in this months Carve that they're expecting a busier than usual hurricane season this year. Nice one! Is this the last post until September?!?
