OK, 2 pounds, not much in the grand scheme of things, but I'll take all I can get. I've actually lost a few pounds on my own, I was 285 about five months ago. But I can't do it myself, I don't do well without some structure. I'd love to say I'm completely self guided, but I don't want to delude myself. I'm happiest when I've got a plan.  When you join WW, you don't get a target weight right away. Your first goal is to loose 10% of your current weight. For me that means 26 pounds. 10% seems like so little, but it also means 242! Put in that perspective, it seems like a LOT.  The meeting itself wasn't much to speak of. Since I've done it before I understood how to use all the tools, how to calculate points, etc. The leader this week was not the regular, she's on holiday. Though this leader was nice enough, she reminds me a bit too much of one of my aunts, and I'm kind of glad she's not going to be our regular leader. She's a bit on the fake side, and her leathery tanned skin freaks me out.
