Welcome Mahendran....convey my wishes to your sister....  still no sign of sangeetha yet???  hey Jax, If I get into posting the receipe for kesari, we will definitely get ' hits ', but not the one you are looking for.  They have introduced new system in London and in few heavy traffic motor ways...called ' Toll system '. It means we have to pay for every mile we drive during the peak hours, in the most congested areas. Soon they are planning  to extend the system in all major cities in UK. It is believed to rduce the traffic by 19%. The transportation system is good here, in particular the tube rails in London. So this system will make people to opt for public transportation instead of cars. It has a good success rate as well. I was just wondering if we bring in the same system to India...how far will it be effective in reducing the traffic??   cheers
