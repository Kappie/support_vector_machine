Will try to make it a point to clean up regularly every Sun morning just to make things easy.  Well, I've classified what's junk; to be thrown, what's to be donated (gotta call Salvation Army tomorrow), what's to be kept. Seriously man, I just realised there's a lot of small knitty gritty things I would like to keep but I had to stone wall myself otherwise I'll be keeping practically everything. My dad was well impressed with my effort and initiative. Somehow he also tried to do the same thing for himself but I think it got worst, so he was quick to lose his momentum. I was practically sneezing and wheezing a little because of all the dust. Hah, also noted that there's a lot which I'm getting rid off without asking my parents. If I did, they'll be nagging me and making so much noise about throwing good stuff out. I seriously have to bypass them if I need to get this done. And no more waiting around to consolidate what needs to be given to the Salvation Army/Red Cross/whatever. All these will just delay me from getting everything done. Hope to clear up the categorised and packed stuff within a few days. Next week, if I'm still jobless, I'll start chopping up my old toys cupboard for firewood muahahah ... so therapeutic. Gonna shift my furniture around alittle here and there when I do get my new loft bed. Hopefully by then I'd already have a job so I can get some new shelves to replace the space for the old cupboard.  Oh yea, tomorrow I'm checking out a Graphic Designer cum Coordinator job. It's located fairly near my place near Whampoa Drive/PIE/Jalan Toa Payoh. Hope it's something decently paid with a good and enjoyable workscope so that I can accept it on the spot.
