So anyways, we looked at a place in the next town over, Bellefonte. This is also where I work so i'll actually be able to *take* my lunch :-)  The place is very nice for Bellefonte. It has 3 bedrooms, two baths and a pretty big kitchen. It is located in a quiet in a building built in 1795. Check out  urlLink some pictures .  The lady showing the apartment told us about the previous tenant leaving a crack open in the screen for the window which lead to some bats taking up residence. She continued to say that someone had removed the two bats from the apartment.  Apparently  more than two bats did this because when we were out back we noticed a bat in the guest bathroom. I went inside and opened the screen to let the bat out. Then we noticed some 7 more bats in the master bedroom which were also easily coached outside. Then there was one that decided to fly around *in* the room which had me dancing up and down to try to get it out of the open window...  this get-the-bat-out-of-the-room dance was some good exercise for myself :-)  Sooo  we probably will move there sometime in July.
