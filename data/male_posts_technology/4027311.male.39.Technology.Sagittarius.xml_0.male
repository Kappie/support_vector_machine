Of course, then no one would be able to read it and I wouldn't be the subject of one of John Dvorak's   ranting  raving columns  . But that's OK; I probably never will be...    Enough about me; let's talk about ME!    I just got back from  urlLink People's Bank  in  urlLink Stop  Shop  in Norwich. The tellers must be under a ton of stress, because the only folks ruder are the poor bastards at DMV (and I do feel bad for them). I was so ticked off at the poor service and exorbitant fees and charges that a couple of months ago, I went in to close the account. I'm such a sucker. They closed the account, alright. By selling me on another, improved, cheaper account. So away I went, content that I was being frugal and responsible. All I had to do was get my ATM/debit card and I was off to the races.    Excpet that the card never arrived. So after a phone call to the local branch and getting routed to Bridgeport (you always get routed to Bridgeport if the local branch doesn't pick up the phone after like, one ring), I was told that the local branch had forgotten to order the card and they would be doing it post-haste.   (Riiiiiight.)   Card still didn't arrive. Called the local branch, talked to Bridgeport (see above explanation). This time the story was that the card had been ordered, but it takes 10-15 business days to arrive. By this time, I'm starting to think I really got my money's worth out of this new account. After another couple of weeks with still no ATM card (today), I decided I would visit the local branch to find out what the hell was going on. They told me that the card was mailed 24 days ago. Would I like to cancel the card and order a new one?  Hmmmmmm. I don't know; what do you think???  So I asked if there were any possible way to get the new card rushed, since I haven't been able to use an ATM in a couple of months that I''ve had the account. Well, yessir, we can rush the card - for a $25 fee that we won't waive.    Fine.   Whatever  . I'll probably never see this new card, either. I am such a sap. I went in to close the account because they don't have a clue how to keep their customers happy or back off on the fees. Instead I have another account and still suffer the same service.    I just think banking should be transparent. You get an ATM card. You use it anywhere. You write checks anywhere. You get your statements in the mail with the cancelled checks. You don't get charged ridiculous fees every time you turn around. Simple, right? Apparently this is not an easy thing to do for these folks. I don't know if it's the people who work there or a bigger problem with the organization itself. Or maybe it's a conspiracy against me. Yeah, that's the most logical idea.
