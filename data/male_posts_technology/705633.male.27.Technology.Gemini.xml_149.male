Greetings faithful readers, this summary of the seventy two hours that my weekend was comprised of is a tale of booze, laughter, torment, games, girls, whore-bag waitresses and well…more booze! So sit back and read in intrigue at life in the shoes of the Toaster Squad.  Picture any normal Friday in Jersey, that’s right, rain falling in complete supremacy, the sun just a meagre forty amp bulb behind dark clouds. All the summer totty has retreated back to their secret location beauty holes, leaving town looking as ugly as Dougal’s arse (yet to come)!   Well, all that crap still couldn’t stop me from being on top of the world, for I am now twenty one and I feel good…but still evil (says with a hell fire glaze in his eyes). I had a superb party at the ‘Monterey Hotel’ to whom I give the biggest thanks due to their excellent service and first-rate food, and alcohol. Also a big ‘up ya’ the the Toaster crew who also made it a great night to remember…videos to follow soon hopefully.  The real party though started on Friday at about half past six when Custard and I met Toaster, Dougal, Bret (Dougal’s brother), Phil, Donna and Crissie at the Wine Bar. We started on the drinks straight away and inhibitions were soon fading away. The lads (God/Satan, which ever you prefer, bless their souls) had a big surprise birthday present for me, can u guess what? … That’s right, I received my official ‘Toaster Files’ T-shirt!!!!!!!!!  After the Wine Bar we headed to Bella Pasta for some food and it was quite good. Next we went to my cousin’s birthday party, which was a great, crack, lots of punk music and sound people. Toaster couldn’t deal with all the excitement and left along with Dougal, Donna and Crissie, oh and Bret. Later in the night Custard and myself left the party and met up with everyone else in the Zebra Square. Now for those of you that havnt yet been to Zebra Square, let me give you a little insight… This place is filled with townies (puh), and the walls are covered in furry zebra style stuff and well…FUCK THAT!!! I went home.  Saturday morning I woke up with a mild headache and went to a private landscaping job which I’m doing for ‘Zippy Alex’s’ dad, at eight in the morning!!! The rest of the day went ok, but the oncoming night was even better hehe. Toaster, Custard, Speedy, Grist, Mash-Boy, Dougal, Bret, Ian, and of course me met up at the Post Horn pub for a few beers, which soon turned into a drinking game called ‘Chicken’ where beer was exchanged for tequila, oh dear! Subsequently I lost four rounds and got quite pissed.  Next all of us decided to get some food so we went to ‘Hectors Fish and Chip Restaurant’ BIG MISTAKE!!!!!!!  We were greeted by what I think was a waitress, whom protested against our entry for some totally unknown reason other than her attitude sucked. However also present was a nicer waitress who said we could sit down, “Hooray” I hear you cry…I think not! That whale-like waitress wasn’t finished with us yet!! … After moaning for about five minutes she decided to take to take our orders, which went about as well as the greeting. Half way through the ordering process she had another flip and ripped up our order and started again… FUCK YOU HECTORS!!!! I DON’T NEED YOUR SHIT OR YOUR SHIT FOOD!!!! To state the obvious, I walked out and met up with Grist and Toaster, whom had both had enough of the bitches whining five minute before me, and we went for a lovely Burger King.  To end the night out we all went to the SPLASH. It was just fucking superb!!! I met loads of old mates of both sexes and partied the night away, THANK YOU SPLASH.   After the Splash, we all waited for a coach back to town. Whilst we waited we had a strenuous session of fighting with each other (don’t ask). Once back in town we decided to throw Bret into Liberation Square pool and laughed as we realised he had his mobile phone in his pocket at the time!! HEHE!  Well that was it, a great couple of nights out with the lads, followed by a recuperative BBQ at my cousins on Sunday. The weekend don’t get much better than that…Baity signing off…
