It appears we've stumbled across something that appears to be a fairly popular past time! Looks like you can also tour abandoned mental institutions, buildings and rooftops too. St. Nick's for the next one...? Or the   real   looney bin up in the woods near the airport? I hear it's run by someone called the "Umbrella Corporation"...
