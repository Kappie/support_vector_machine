It was, in the words of Paul, 'filthily' hot in the store. I brought some chocolate after we shut and it was soft! I know last summer it was hot enough for the chocolate to have melted. It all had to be sent back because apparently you could hold up a bad of chocolate and see it in almost liquid form. Yucky. Oh yes I am looking forward to working over summer.  I managed to slice my hand 3 times with scissors today while ripping up boxes. Owee. They sting a lot.   Other news in my world; I have convinced mother to allow me to dye my hair, but only when I am 18 which is good. Better than the normal NO I get. LOL.
