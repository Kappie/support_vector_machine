I then jumped in my car, drove over to the bank and cashed my travel expense check.  I got home, went over to the dump in my van, got rid of a bunch of stuff.  Then I drove over to the hardware store and got 10 2"x10"x12' boards.  The cash register where I was checking out took forever, and then I had to wait for the two people before me to load their vehical up.  I finally got home at 3:45pm.  Almost 3 hours to just get a few boards.   Good Times.   It is hot here today.  I am just sitting back drinking colas, wine coolers and gatorade. Thinking about programming.  I checked my electric bill and found out that I didn't have to pay this month :D Oh well, put the payments down to just $50 a month now, that should keep them happy until it gets cold again.  I went wild with the new paper binder I have.  Got a lot of stuff hole punched last night.  Going to keep going tonight with that.  Have a lot of loose papers to get organized.
