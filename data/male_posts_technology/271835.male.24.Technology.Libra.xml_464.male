Predictibly, the ol'  urlLink septic   urlLink tanks  flip out like a bunch of Ninja's... So Simon scores points for:   Flipping the bird  Having a  urlLink tasty girlfriend   He even has his own  urlLink fansites !  Did I mention I looooove American's...?? (Fusk it... I'm going for the record!) See we've been getting a lot of traffic from  urlLink Google  lately, and a lot of it's been from the good ol' US of A. See I love lots of american things... after all, they gave us the  urlLink Hollywood  and  urlLink Carmen Electra . They also invented the  urlLink SawFish , which is the worlds first underwater chainsaw wielding robot. It cuts down trees that have been submerged under lakes behind  urlLink dams . Speaking of chainsaw wielders, anyone who's seen the front cover of  urlLink Edge  this month will  see they got some coverage of  urlLink Resident Evil 4  (or  urlLink Biohazard 4  as it's called in Japan).  urlLink Capcom  established the "survival horror" genre with the release of the  urlLink first Resi  game in 1996. Hand's up if you remember  urlLink Alone in the Dark  - the game that kicked it all off in 1992. And that should put me in the  urlLink Guinness   urlLink Book of Records . ;)
