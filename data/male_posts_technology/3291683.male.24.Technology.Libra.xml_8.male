       
      One of my co-workers just gave me a piece of paper, and said "What date does it say?"  The piece of paper had "2004-01-04" on the top corner.  I immediately responded "January 4th, 2004" without thinking about it the tiniest bit.  He said "So the month is the one in the middle?"  And y'know, he's right; for the average American, that IS a serious question, and if I had actually stopped to think about it, I really wouldn't have been sure offhand.  Funny how just the little things can throw you off, heh?
