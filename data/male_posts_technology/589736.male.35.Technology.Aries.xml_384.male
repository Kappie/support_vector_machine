(yes, this mean you show up,pay for your own dinner, i pick the restaurant) on October 13th, 6pm at Panda Garden on Grace St.    I would request no spouses, dates, etc. to this event - Ben (sorta) just wants this to be an event for the sarcastic folk who participate on this blog.  Thanks and please RSVP on this blog so you can pressure other members to show up!
