    
       Saturday.  Finally.  Got up today, checked to see if I got any mail from Jason.  Nope.  I'm really kinda nervous about the book-writing thing, but I am going to go for it.  I got mono to compile this morning, and I want to get around to doing the XML Encryption stuff soon.   Today I went out shopping with a short list of things to get.  One of them was a flag to replace the one that the neighbourhood punks stole from my porch.  I didn't get the flag, but I did go to Canadian Tire.  While I was browsing around, I spied a 52" ceiling fan that was about $100 off the regular price.  Since we've been looking for a ceiling fan for our bedroom for quite some time, and since this one was nice, we decided to get it.  Of course, I had to hum and haw for about 30 minutes over the fact that we were going to spend $70 on a ceiling fan, but that's a lot better than $170.  So, of course, I screwed up my plan to BBQ tonight by installing the fan this evening instead.  It looks nice.  I didn't realize before how low the ceiling is in our bedroom -- it's not even 7 feet!  The fan manual says that the blades need to be at least 7 feet above the floor.  I'm only 6" below that. :-)  Lesson learned today: go with your instinct.  I spent so much time thinking about that fan, only to buy it.  I decided that if I didn't want it I could return it anyway.  If I had just gone with what I thought in the first place all would have been well. However, because of my indecisiveness, I managed to upset the wife.  See, we had already been out for a couple of hours, and little William was with us.  We thought he would probably be quite hungry and wet.  We went straight home after that and he was fine, but the damage had been done.  I'm lucky enough to have a wife that understands me and loves me for who I am.
