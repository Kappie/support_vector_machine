If not, then you missed a great 5318008 opportunity to check out  urlLink Katherine Jenkins  who is, apparantly, an opera singer (bit of a crap picture on the link, but you'll get the idea)! Don't know anything about that but she's got a nice set of lungs on her, and she looks a bit like Carmen Electra! Bloody h3ll! ;)   I'm off to practice "La Triviata" or something..
