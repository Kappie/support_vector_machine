We had a house meeting and my head of house is really nice (always a good start when u have friendly staff around), then we went to various sessions on how to think, revise and work efficiently, some of which was useful (but most wasn't!). Got chatting to quite a few people about things, generally it's cool and my tutor is nice, in all aspects!! ;) Anyway! Not got much else to say really. Tah tah
