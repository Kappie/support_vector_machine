I didn't have much to drink but it was so close yesterday I think I was a bit De-Hydrated) so my blog will probably be incoherent at best..  Things are going exceptionally well for me recently. I'm feeling content in my life, not something I am used to. I've already blogged about how well work has been going recently (although it is getting very close to the end of the month damn it..) so I'm going to navigate the dodgy waters that is blogging about my relationships..  I'm moving in with Orla next month some time and I couldn't be happier about it.. Things are going better than I would have ever expected. When I first started seeing Orla I wasn't looking for a relationship really.. I had thought I'd had my fill of relationships for the moment and I think Orla was in the same position.  So what happened? I honestly can't tell you. I still don't quite understand what has happened.. I just know that I am happy in a way that is different to anything I have experienced in a long time.. I've always kept a part of myself locked away, a safe point to retreat to and keep a type of control over my emotions..  Anyone that knows me well knows that I have a way of shutting myself off when I feel too emotional or vulnerable. This has always been my safety switch.. I don't like losing control of myself and never really let myself be ruled by my emotions.. But all that is changing now..  Does that mean everything else I ever felt wasn't real or true? No. The best I can explain it (given that I still don't really understand it) is that this "fits" me.. So far there have been matchs that were so close to being right, but they were just not right. It didn't "fit" properly.  Anyway.. The point of my blog (This blog is something I have wanted to write for a while) is to say I'm happy and things are good.. I'm happy in work and love and can't wait to see where my life is going to take me next..  Heh.
