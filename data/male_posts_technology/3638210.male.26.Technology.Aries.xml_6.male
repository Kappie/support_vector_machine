Those are all fine and good, but the primary reason for me is to avoid the 5-7pm rush hour. Yes, I would rather endure physical pain than wait any longer in traffic than I have to.  Anyway, I had done some laps in the pool a few weeks ago and was ready for a shower and a blissfully short drive home afterwards.  I enter the shower, which is just a central pipe with six shower heads fanned out, and a few seconds later another guy comes in and starts the shower head right next to mine. Now, I'm pretty sure the world is aware of the social nuances of "urinal etiquette", and if anything I believe it applies even more so in public showers.  Didn't think that much about it, but then the guy starts talking to me asking me how my work out was. Now this may have been acceptable ifI alreadyknew this person, but even then our conversationshould have consisted of: "Hey." -- "Hey." -- "Good work out?" -- "Yeah. You?" -- "Yeah." But oh no, this dude wanted details. "What did you do?" "Ran a little, then swam," I said, already at the max limit of words I would usually exchange at that point.  Well, he starts telling me how he was running too and training for amarathon and maybe I'm making up rules at this point, but these aren't the times to strike up any type of deep or lengthy conversation. But maybethe guy was just being sociable so I madesome throw away comment about how that must be tough.  I guess I should have given a more non-responsive "Yeah" because he launched into his training schedule and different races he's done. At this point I'm finished and turning off my shower head when he says, "Sure could go for a massage right now, though."  Ok, so how does one respond to that? I didn't want to make any assumptions--though they may have been accurate ones--about this guy's persuasion and how much of a statement versus request that was. And so for lack of anything better I nod and say, "Well... good luck with that."  As a sidebar, that's what Andy Richter, in his short-lived FOX show Andy Richter Control The Universe, saidto a co-worker when he got an employee referral bonus after her referral was stoned to death for driving a bumper carand she commented to him, "I was going to use the money for Grammy's Varicose vein surgery... she's always wanted to de-vein those grotesque legs..."  What a versatile turn of phrase. Thank you, Mr. Richter.
