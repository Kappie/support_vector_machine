I'll post some pictures with a link later. I went to court to pay a traffic ticket, which really pissed me off. I got a fix-it ticket a block away from my house, the officer was just looking for some revenue for the good ol state budget. The ticket was $10 if I fixed the crack (by replacing the windshield which I couldnâ€™t find for a 64 Galaxie very easy), or I could pay $ 110 if I chose not to replace the windshield and the ticket would be cleared up. I tried to pay by phone ($110) with my credit card which didn't work so I had to go in to the court house to do it, and they still didn't let me use my MasterCard (only VISA). Well by that time it turned into a failure to appear and the total amount ended up being $290....  I saw the same cop this morning giving another person a ticket for a crack in the windshield (I assume this because they had a crack in their windshield). I guess that cop is going to get a golden Donut Award for most revenue generated from people not doing serious crimes....   What a total Ass...  If Sacramento would fix there damn roads and not have rocks from potholes all over them there would probably be less windshield tickets and that would be less revenue so lets keep those roads dangerous out there...  -Casey
