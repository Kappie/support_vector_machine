I will consider it a point of pride that we have lots and lots of books as long as I can drum up enough help to carry all the books down the stairs.  Shelves that were once full of things are now bare. The computer is still in its spot, mainly because we'll need it up to the point that we move. At last count, there are maybe 20 boxes already in the house, full of books, pencils, kitchen appliances, dishes, games, baby clothes, and other things. I haven't packed the two typewriters that are on top of the hutch on this desk, and the entire closet is still untouched by the moving effort. The closet may present the greatest challenge to moving, since it's so cavernous, and a lot of what is in there doesn't seem to go well into boxes.  This will be the moment when those who help us move see all the stuff we have, and will decide for themselves whether we have a lot of junk or not. They will think to themselves, "What's the deal with the Wessmans? Where did they get all this stuff?" This won't be idle thoughts, as well, because they'll be lugging it, box by box, down the tenuous iron staircase of the current apartment. "Good thing they are moving to a bigger place--they probably never had everything put away," they'll say to each other.  20 boxes and not even halfway there. Yeah, there's some portion of me that aspires to minimalism, but it so happens that that part of me is easily overpowered by the part of me that thinks having a motorcycle windshield for a motorcycle that I sold almost two years ago is necessary and good. I think I'll muster the energy to donate it to the Deseret Industries thrift store. Does anyone want a motorcycle windshield?  Jules and I are probably going to put the computer and the writing desk in separate spots. I think it will be good, because it's rare that I'm on the computer, but also needing a reading place nearby. So we'll see how that works. I keep thinking about the new place. Will it be warm enough? Cool enough? Will our neighbors be friendly?
