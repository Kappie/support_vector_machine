 I think that iTunes 4.0 looks pretty cool, but considering Apple's dwindling market share I don't think Apple's music store itself will make much of dent. The more interesting thing to watch will be how the other broader market online music services react. However, if Apple releases some form of "iTunes for Windows" with the same type of rights then that would be interesting. Even then we all know competing with MS on the windows platform is pretty near impossible. However, I do hope Apple does something for the "iPod Window users" as this will force MS to come up with something better.
