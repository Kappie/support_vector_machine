This holideezie seazie was crazy and epic indeed.....herez how the caper went down.....  12/23/03:  I start my surf trip down the coast by leaving one day early to attend a company xmas party with JR.  This is his company party...not mine....need to clarify that before I tell you how fucken bad it sucked.  This party was for his team....small group of open GL engineers (math geeks).  Needless to say I was bored out of my fucken skull.  I'm usually a social butterfly, but at this party, I cut my losses, sat in the corner....and tried to kill myself by holding my breath.....that's really hard to do.  This affair lasted for 3-fucken-hours!   12/24/03:  OK...finally escaped from the lamest "party" in the history of the world and I wake up refreshed in a Motel 6 in Santa Barbra.....time to surf yet?  Nope.  JR decides that he needs a surf rack for the hippie bus or else the trip will be a wash....so I spend the morning with him shopping for and installing a rack.  While this is happening...I see some dood trying to steal a jacket from a surf shop.....2 teen age employees running after his ass.  Now I ask this....If i'm gonna steal something...i'm not going to do it from a store full of angry teens who are in great shape....needless to say the kids caught him and got the merch back.  Finally in the afternoon, I get my first surf on at Rancon beech.  A dolphin surfaces about 5 yards away from me....I almost shit myself cause being from NoCal....I think its a fucken shark!  The dood next to me cracks up and tells me to get a grip.....doh!  I get rolled here for the first time in a while.  Paddle into a wave...find myself 10 feet in the air...surf board perls....i go under....and stay under.....have a life flash....feel a rock.....next thing i know....i finally surface...nothing like getting rolled to get you in the mood!   12/25/03:  Merry xmas!  Me n JR get to his brother Charles house in wonderful LA.  Xmas in LA is like Xmas in hell.  These people don't believe in anything!  No lights....no trees....no little creep gnomes making toys for good kids....just a bunch of neat guys.  Now Charles is pretty much one of the coolest doods i've met...really cool....also some manner of Yogi (yoga rock star of sorts).  Spent xmas with him...the excentric neighbor downstaris named Siri Sat Nam....took me days to remember that shit.  He was cool n crazy....when he calls someone and they answer the phone he says...."it is I"....just to give you an idea.   12/26/03:  Head up the caost from LA to Malibu to get some more surf on.  Malibu had one of the best breaks we found.  Had a good time surfing....met some strage chick from bay area.....most depressed person i've ever met....fuck her!  We goto a camp ground....and rough it....(watch something about mary on a laptop...hey....of course we brougt a computer....we're nerds!)   12/27/03:  Back to Santa Barbra for more surfing.  Had a great morning surf.  We hang out in town....watchn at the skate park....2 kids are in a 2 seated bike like contraption....both with joints hanging out of thier mouthes take this thing down a ramp and crash it......funnest shit i saw all day.  They pick up the bike, and ride off before the skate park rangers bust they asses.  We go out.....get drunk.....I flatten JRz tire.....we fight....been too many dayz in the saddle i guess....we decide it is time to head north.   12/28/03:  Despite being hindered by all kinds of bullshit....we finally make it home!  I need to sleep off all the booze!  Day of rest.   12/29/03:  Back in the saddle again....me n Jwimp Daddy Cain head up to the city for an epic man-date.  We get a hotel (they only gave us 1 bed......its a queen....we spoon) and go out and drink like a fucken rock band!   12/30/03:  Back to Campbell....get a buch of dood to rally and we go out to Boswells.....again...get drunk like sailors.  On the walk home from the bar...i decide that it is a good idea to climb to the top of a bus stop.....i fall......i have bruises the size of small children all over my legs....i cant run for a wile.....and my knee is swollen to the size of a fucken mellon...no shit!   12/31/03:  No rest for the wicked....meet up with the  crew in down town sunnyvale....the madness continues!  Again getting wasted and dancing alone (we've discussed this in the past) we bring in 04.  Does the fun stop here?  Fuck no...me n the Dirt Bike Kid hop in his car at 1:00 am and drive to Tahoe!  Hey...why not.   1/1/04 - 1/3/04:  This is like 1 long day with no clear details....alphas or omegas....just blur of drinking....mease monkey would be proud!   So much happened.....and now that its all over......i'm beat up....tired....my neighbor's dog is pregnant and i walk with a limp....epic i tell you!
