       
      I'm declaring today null and void.  I managed to show up at work today and do my job, which consists of sitting in a cubicle and waiting until I can go home.  Society would crumble were it not for my efforts.  By the time I was allowed to leave, I didn't have the energy to go to the gym, cook dinner, read, or write.  I will do nothing constructive tonight in the hopes that my batteries will be recharged for another go tomorrow.  In any case, today never happened.  I'm pushing my next birthday celebration forward 24 hours.
