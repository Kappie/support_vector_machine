There's a certain curiosity towards a game that shows every single entity in the game as a real, living, breathing (maybe), human being. The whole concept is staggering to say the least. So many possibilities. Of course, some Sony executive had to go up and say "Well, we can capitalize on this phenomenon big time!!!" and who wouldn't?!?!   But this. Star Wars. It's Star Wars. They, in their most mystical fashion, can ruin (well, ruin more of what's already ruined) the single greatest licensing opportunity for a game.   Have they? I'm not sure. I never played the game. Suffice it to say, I have been thinking about it (50 bucks + 15 bucks a month). The whole "pay to play" scheme never really works for me though. How can Warcraft III, Starcraft, Counterstrike, and Battlefield 1942 among others are free to play? What's so different? Probably a lot. Probably not so much. It's all about the dollah.  I'm getting Warcraft III and The Frozen Throne expansion this week for a good price. I've decided to give it another chance since I was humiliated by the computer the very first time I played it. I'm not concerned. I'm willing to give it another shot.   Oh look! Another call from a person who doesn't know what they're doing.
