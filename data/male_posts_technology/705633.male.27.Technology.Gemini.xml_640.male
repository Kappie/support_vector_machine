This is the time when half the people in the world are depressed as its a new year, Most of them have promised someone something they will never intend to keep and the rest have spent a fortune on a gym membership that they will only attend to eight times in the next four months. 2004 has some nice things for us. For starters, its a leap year. That means that there is an extra day for all of us to work. but does anyone get an extra days holiday? No? Its just one way for our employers to shaft us! Also, That festive excuse for comercial commitment called christmas is on a Saturday this year. That means that Boxing day is on Sunday. yet another day we should have as holiday is taken from us like a grubby six year old with a nice bogey hanging on his fingertip, ready to taste when aunty has a napkin on rapid approach with said finger on an intercept course! Bitter? Me? naa, just bored at work...  On, and Scott..... Boobies!!!!!
