This is my contribution to the HTML.asp.PHP collage of destruction we call the web.  Bill Gates said the internet was a passing fad and I agreed with him back then like I do right now.  My Blue-WAP 802.11m super-G enabled knifeset  I bought on  urlLink E-bay  is cutting edge but this  urlLink Google  enabled HTML stuff has a limited lifespan in my opinion.  Some good news is that I've decided to invest in a scheme I've had a tip off about. This scheme seems like a guaranteed  winner.  I feel this time I'm going to get lucky - not like all those other times.  I'll still make an effort to update this blog even after I cash in on my imminent  urlLink Nigerian  fortune.  Things I'll be posting include links to sites I find interesting.  Rants on politics, bogus-philosophy and numerous statements of “fact” that are weighted with opinion but not necessarily true and or relevant.  This is my electronic ejection seat for musings and the like.  It's also a darn convenient way to stay in touch with lots of folks with out clogging up your tidy inboxes.
