Too bad these people didn't get to vote in 2000 and we got stuck with a dingleberry for a president!    UPDATE   Above link may be broken for registration that even I won't bother to do.  This decision comes  urlLink at the release of the 47,000 names  that made up the list of voters who may be purged.  Florida will  urlLink restore voting rights to some 2,500  of the 47,000 they intended to deny voting in 2004.  That compared to  urlLink 170,000  some odd voters purged in 2000.
