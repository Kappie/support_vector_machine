I don't work til later tomorrow tho, so I'll go tomorrow to make up for it.    Went to some blog site this morning and he spent the whole blog explaining how Michael Moore made everything up in Fahrenheit 9/11.  Now, it seems to me that this guy should pull his head out of his ass and do a little research.  First of all, Moore has never hidden from the fact that this is purely and op/ed piece.  So of course the facts in it are contexted to his side of the story.  Second of all, this bonehead on the blog goes on to talk about how Bush didn't stay reading to kids for 7 minutes or whatever it is after he got the news, and how Bush didn't welcome in al qaida members to texas and how Bush doesn't have relationships with the Bin Laden family.  Uhhh...dumbfuck...it's all available to you if you look, and everything you contested you're wrong about.    I almost commented to this guy that he's an idiot, but I thought 'Nah...let him think what he thinks.'  It's not my job to go around correcting people, and frankly if this guy is that brainwashed by republican propaganda, all my comments are going to do is piss him off.  So I didn't bother.    Now, I'm not saying that I believe every word Michael Moore says like it's gospel or something...I know he edits things to get his point across.  But I am smart enough to do the research and figure out the wheat from the chaff.  I totally agree with Michael Moore's way of thinking, just not always his defense of his arguments.  Regardless of whether you believe everything Moore tells you or not, George Bush is the biggest threat to world peace since Adolf Hitler.  And that's just commonly available facts telling me this.    Having said all that, I haven't actually seen Fahrenheit yet...I'm gonna wait for the video, cuz why bother paying 25 bux to see a documentary?  So...having not seen the movie who's to say that I have the slightest clue of what I speak? Hehe
