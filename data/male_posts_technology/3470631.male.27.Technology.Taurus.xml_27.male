Well that, and the fact that I didn't get laid yet again.   The North Shore went unexplicably wrong when they decided to use the 15 year old in the storyline - over and above shots of her in her bikini. That and the fact that the lead guy is a choposauraus of the worst kind - I didn't know widow's peak and bald dudes were worthy of being lead men in Hollywood. Guess that will put me in good standing in about 10-15 years (maybe sooner!) s;ladfk  I'm really looking forward to Napoleon Dynamite coming out in theaters in the Boston area this week. Everyone check out the trailer if you have not already. Looks amazing - though Lobron was not overly impressed. He never is.   It's hot as hell out there and the peeps are always disappointing in Norwood Mass. I need to get back into the city ASAP.   I'm thinking of mixing it up on a couple fronts. DEVELOPING.   TTP - thanks for the advance notice of your visit. I'll be away that weekeendsafkj big loss I know.   WHAT UP AMY  Todd Rosenthal had his prom this past weekend - congrats TSR. At my prom, my date sucked another guy's dick. We weren't dating, but isn't that a kick in the nuts regardless?   The fact is, I made alot of wrong decisions in High School. I could've used a big brother to set me straight from the beginning. I'm trying not to make the same mistakes now though -- but at 27 is it too late? What should I be doing every night? Should I be going out? Should I be meeting CHICKS? Should I be working later?   JESUS CHRIST - what's a single 27 year old guy to do? What is the course to success -- am I on it?   Is anyone still reading?
