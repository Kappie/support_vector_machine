       
       Anger --> Hate --> Suffering   I used to like my job. Slowly but surely, I am now starting to despise the very people I help everyday. Add the fact that I am now resuming the position that I had in Asset Management. Creating requisitions for product, request for quotes, emailing purchasing for purchase orders, and scanning, emailing, signing, filing maintenance/software/hardware contracts and/or invoices.  It's official. I hate my job.
