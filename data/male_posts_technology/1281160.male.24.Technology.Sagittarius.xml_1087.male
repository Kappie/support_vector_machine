When you do something for your outer self, most of the times it's all to do with what others will say, what they will think, all possible kind of pretention. Innerself is what you think, what you hear from you, who you are...... Being myself is the time when I can express my innerself without having the fear of being rejected for anything.             Ram, I din't mean the outer look or heart feeling. Rini..Give us more update on what kind of work srini is going to do at onsite? Even I don't know where it's located. Then..Today I stayed in office itself. We are having an audit for CMMI in April. My PL is going onsite this weekend. So we sat all through the night and finished something.
