I understand that these things are out of control and I can see your sentiments because we don't want to live in a bad world, but cheering for one side without reviewing the other is wrong  *ayjayess* we do live in a world where a lot of good is being done, all I'm trying to say is that often the motivation behind a war (like Iraq) was not correct  *ayjayess* furthermore, we are dominated by a super power whether we accept it or not  *Black_Lotus* I believe the U.S. has less than 20 years at being the global super power (that is, unless John Titor is correct), but the UN and other nations should have placed trade and economic sanctions on the U.S  *ayjayess* yes, a system exists that defines rules and an organisation, but do we actually adhere to those rules ?  *ayjayess* or do we adhere to them when we want to  *Black_Lotus* America cannot rule forever and that is what the rest of the world is failing to see. They are in a recession, unemployment is the highest in years, their currency is failing and global opinion of them is plummeting.   *ayjayess* The US produces so much itself, sanctions won't hurt it and even if it does, the US can simply take what they want when they want if it became ugly enough  *Garson007* but the UN and other nations should have placed trade and economic sanctions on the U.S *-- didn’t you mean not...  *Black_Lotus* America does not have the agriculture sector to sustain it's populating (SA and a few others do)  *ayjayess* no, he wants them to place sanctions on the US to prevent them from creating the war on Iraq  *ayjayess* so the US would start to starve if sanctions were imposed, yes, now it makes sense  *Garson007* Black_Lotus: It's called black-marketing, more money for smugglers  *ayjayess* but still, the US can simple take what they want because that situation would cause them to try to survive and they are big enough to do what they want  *ayjayess* the black market ain't large enough to sustain part of a country that size  *Black_Lotus* I am not stupid. I know that with sanctions the US would most likely invade Mexico or something, but even then, would the people of their nation no begin to question their leaders?  *Garson007* Black_Lotus: Civil war, john Titor  *ayjayess* well, I'm sure Hitler was questioned...  *Garson007* But, Hitler fought with spirit behind him, USA citizens are already uneasy  *Black_Lotus* In the times of Hitler there were never the communication advances of today, "Email, fax, telephone, internet" Information cannot be contained anymore  *ayjayess* yeah, liberty and freedom in America may cause the people to impeach their president but still, people want to survive, it is their instinct  *Black_Lotus* Garson007 ---*(Black_Lotus: Civil war, john Titor) was about to say that maybe that is how the civil war might start  (Break… No Debate)  *Garson007* Like I said in my quote post thingy. "People want a leader, people want freedom. Make up your minds!"  *Garson007* They can't have both  *ayjayess* people like to believe they are free
