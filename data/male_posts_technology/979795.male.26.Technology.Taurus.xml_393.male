Especially this Guilian ... ultra long posts man hahaha. Anyway, my mind is quite dead to absorb everything I'm reading on these blogs so I only left minimal messages or comments here and there. At least I've managed to update the format of my blogpage. Now all the links are back. Only thing I'm hoping to be able to do is to include my old enetations link so that I can check the comments with regards to older blogs. Oh well, not a priority lah so I'll see how is it later.  Resumed my 3km run this morning before going to work. Felt great after that but I built up a lot of heat inside and I can feel myself still perspiring even after a shower. One good thing, I noticed I still maintained the stamina. Only big thing I needed to note was maintaining pace throughout the distance I'm running and I should be able to complete it OK. I think at this stage, daily running is necessary for me to get ready in time for AHM 2004. Doesn't sound possible but I may take 1-2 break days depending on my physical readiness, workload, etc.  Aikido at Siglap yesterday saw 2 new adult students - husband and wife actually. Husband was Chinese and wife was ... I dunno, maybe French? I detect an accent somewhere. Took warmups but I seemed to have missed out the wrists exercises. Haiz, felt like blaming others but actually it was my own fault. I was asking Leon what came after this or that exercise. Shoulda trusted my instincts more and just do the warmups in the sequence my brain remembered them. See lah, in the end made everyone miss out on warmups. Anyway, the couple were quite keen to bring their 5 yr old son, goin-onto 6, for the Sun class at Siglap. Good lah, we get additions in both classes this way. Just hope things didn't seem too slow and boring for the couple during their first day of training. Coz I realise a lot of pple actually stop Aikido even before they've started it.  I'm glad Sakai (judoka yudansha) stayed on. He's been with us for about 1 mth or so. He seems to be improving too. Still stiff but you can see him getting better. Paired with him for the duration of the evening. We did TOOOOOONS of shomenuchi ikkyo and nikkyo (omote + ura waza). Most probably because Richard had to give most of his attention to the 2 beginners. Well, that's fine. Most part of the night I shared what I knew to be the 'finer' pts of the technique with Sakai, tips mentioned or overheard.  As when I first started, Sakai tend to miss taking the side step. Pointed out to him we tend to be crashing into each other even before the technique was done. He did manage to pick it up slowly. I think the actual ratio of practice I had to his was only about 1:4. I tend to go along and let him repeat as many times as he wants till he got comfortable with the technique. Next mistake I noted was he almost always grabbed my arm when I used a shomen strike. Pointed out that it was more of a guiding movement. Other things I managed to point out were footwork, positioning, etc. Well, at least he was willing to listen. I only hope I didn't bombard him with too much information last night.  For kokyu-ho (my crappiest), Sakai tend to anticipate what I was going to do. So most often I really was just following his arms instead. I advised him to close his eyes instead and just feel what I'm doing. It helped a bit but not much. His 'stiffness' is most noticeable during kokyu-ho. But there was something really nice towards the end of kokyu ho. He did manage to move a bit more smoothly and lessen the stiffness. Not great, but still good.  At the end of class, managed to speak to the couple. They were asking things about belt colors and all that. Told them the twins (Darryl and Daniel) were more senior than me. They were a bit surprised and the wife mentioned something about seeing me 'teach' the other guy (Sakai). Ar ... I think I might've said too much liao with Sakai that's why it gave them that impression. Anyway, told them that us students aren't qualified to teach, only to share hahaha.  All in all, was a nice evening.  Will be meeting Henry tonight, he's one of the old M113 drivers I was with during our trainee days. Haven't sen him for a good 4-5 yrs in fact. Dunno what we'll be doin, but in the very least we'll be grabbing dinner. Hope to be able to catch a movie too before work piles up so much I can't do so.  Serious man, this holiday is quite a killer. I don't get these much stuff in a normal school term. Haiz, dunno how to finish everything before the given deadlines. Organise organise organise ... and stop procrastinating you fool!
