My mind is in a state of disarray.  I am not myself...not dead...and not for sale.  The big things i can handle...its all the little fucking things that got my nuts chafe.  I need a mental health day...as I question the state of my mental health.  As prokey pig would say...."Lord....Im meloncca....meloncca.....Lord...I'm pretty darn sad"
