I introduced Wendy to my wife Scottee not too long after Wendy and I became close friends. I was hoping that they would hit it off since my Wife was new to the state and certainly could use some friends. She is a stay at home mom and I know how tedious that can be.   We all went out one night and had a great time playing pool and drinking and I became aware that Scottee was certainly attracted to Wendy. Scottee had numerous (9) relationships with women since we had been married so her attraction to a woman certainly didn't come as a shock.   The next day after going out I was having a casual IM conversation with Wendy while at work when she dropped a rather large bomb on me. She mentioned that she had always wanted to experiment with a woman and she found Scottee to be very attractive. Normally this wouldn't come as a major shock since this kind of situation certainly wasn't new to me. Scottee had been turning women's heads for quite some time. In fact, I often wonder if she is giving off major signals that straight, bi, and gay women unconsciously pick up on. The thing that floored me was that Wendy and I had previous conversations about bi women and she had made it very clear that she had never entertained the thought.  So that day I spent relaying messages between Wendy and Scottee that they were both very interested in each other and might want to explore the possibility of being intimate. At the same time, I learned that Wendy was also interested in me, which was nice since it would allow me to participate in the intimacy. I had always found her quite attractive.  Enough for now. I'll also post pictures of Scottee and Wendy.
