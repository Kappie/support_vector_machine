Suffice it to say, we were the first ones in line.  By a long shot.  Man, I felt so nerdy!  OK the movie:   The action sequeneces were breathtaking.  Very well done, well photographed, great special effects.    But in between the action, there was pulling teeth painful times of emotional blah blah blah and spidey crying and the girl crying and the grandma crying and the friend crying aw my gawd - GET OVER IT - and start the action up!    And the girl in the movie (Kirsten Dunst) - oh my gawd - has someone heard of make-up???  She looked horrible the whole movie and was painful to watch.  And oh yeah she was crying too.  I felt the director was trying to be too artsy and too cute with all the background and motivation and blah blah blah.    Another point - when spidey was flying around - it looked very cartoonish - the CGI has gotten really carried away so much so that it is hard to differentiate reality and cartoons and it all looks like cartoons...for example the helicopters in the closing sequence...straight out of toy story or shrek.
