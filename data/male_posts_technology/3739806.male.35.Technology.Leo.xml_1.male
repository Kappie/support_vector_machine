They were very nice a little too nice mostly. I had fun though lots of beautiful fun girls. Helped me put the whole XXXXX situation into perspective. Funny thing is when it ended with XXXXX a few years ago I could not wait to jump into another womans arms, now it seems like no one is good enough. What does that mean? Does that say something about me or about my relationship with XXXXX?  I caught XXXXX in a little white lie. Playing games.... Trying to get me to chase her. *Sigh* is anyone ever going to live up to my standards?   Ha ha here is something funny. The girl that has been emailing me... Turns out some of her friends wrote some of the emails thinking she was going to screw it up with me. Which she did but not because of the emails. I called her up and talked to her. Classic case of someone seeming attractive until you have a real conversation with them. Not because she was stupid. Because she was closed minded. Seemed to have very narrow opinions about life the universe and everything.
