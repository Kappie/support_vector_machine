This time they are trying to limit the shipments of all PCs with Intel processor above the power of pentium 3 outside the US.  They claim that it's too much computing power and it can be used in military purposes.  So what are the outcomes of such legislation?  1 - the bad guys who want to buy those computers get them anyway because they can afford it 2 - US based companies loose market share because someone out there is going to clone the CPUs and sell them to the people who want them.  From CNet's article: http://news.com.com/Defense+bill+could+stifle+computer+trade/2100-7341_3-5253873.html?tag=nefd.lede  Seymore Goodman, professor of International Affairs and Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the author of two policy papers used by the Clinton administration on the issue, stressed the impossibility of restricting computers that no longer require entire rooms to house them. Now smuggling a few more computer chips to expand a cluster is easy, he said.  "If this gets through Congress, it is a regression of mind-boggling proportions," Goodman said. "You cannot control anything that is made by the millions and which you can put in your pocket."
