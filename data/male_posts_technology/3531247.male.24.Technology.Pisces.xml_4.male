Life is put into perspective when you see someone else's destroyed. I Wish I could take my grandmother to visit Japan. She is Japanese, and hasn't been back since the 50's. I know that would rock her world. I spoke with my Mom, and she wasn't feeling well. Worrying about everyone, but herself. If she could quit smoking, go back and finish her degree ( 8 Credits away!). If she could just think about herself for a change. I think my Dad is doing OK. It was his B-day today. 47. I think he's going to run with me in the Marine Corps Marathon. He's got to quit smoking too. Gina, Julie, Rita, Patty, and my Mom (sisters) have not been on good terms since my Grandfather died. He and my grandmother were such a presence that when they died the sisters could not stick together. I worry about my Aunt Mary also. Drugs have gotten the best of her in resent years. I hope she can overcome, I know it's difficult, and understand where she is coming from. Only a few of us are dealt the best cards. I have been so fortunate. I had the best of all my family growing up, and the reason I have been successful is because, everyone in my family gave me every building block that I needed to insure it.
