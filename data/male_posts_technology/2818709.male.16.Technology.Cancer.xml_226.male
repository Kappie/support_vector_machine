Now, since i'm too lazy to retype it, my newspaper article!  Wheeeee! Rant Time: Video Game Violence. By Nick Petschel  Ok, let me start this rant by saying this: I am an avid geek and a gamer. I love technology. I'm the guy that you see at his computer at 2 'o clock in the morning playing Unreal Tournament on his customized pc. I'm the guy that would pass up a date for a LAN party. Yeah. I'm   that   much of a loser. Yet somehow, I've still got a girlfriend and somewhat of a social life. Yep. Good times. Anyways, What really makes me mad, is when stodgy old politicians blame school shootings, murders, rapes, and stabbings on video games, more specifically, first-person shooters. Ok, look, just because the two guys that killed all of those people at columbine played quake, does not mean that all gamers are violence-prone crazies. I'm a relatively sane person, most of the time, but, when I start up a game of Savage, I'm just that, a savage. You can take all of your problems out on "Ghastly_Freak" or "ur_m0m". For me, at least, video games give me a place to vent so that I don't walk around beating people up. Video games don't get mad when you don't lend them a dollar. Video games don't give you an F on a paper you spent 4 hours creating. Video games are there when you need them, and they are easily packed away when you don't. If you get mad at a game, you can turn it off. There's nothing stopping you. Gamers are usually more sane than non-gamers. Non-gamers donâ€™t really have a place to vent except to a friend, which can be offended, or a psychiatrist, which cost major blingage, or to a complete stranger. Most strangers get kind of freaked out when you walk up to them and say "Hi, my name's Nick. I hate my teacher/parents/boss. I want to rip out her/his spine and use it as a golf putter." Instead of doing that, you can turn on your xbox/ps2/gc/pc, double click/slip in your favorite game, and take your wrath out on the nearest object in the game. Just because you enjoy shooting birds with a desert eagle doesn't mean that you will take a shotgun to work and splatter your boss' brains all over the wall. Here are a few people that are gamers, and here is what they have to say:  Kacy Southerland - "Super Mario- The original game rocked, and you can't try to "update" an old school classic."  Will Hodgson - "Tetris is the sport of the gods!"  In conclusion, video games keep the madness off the streets. Censor our games any more, and you'll (essentially) let the crazies out. Don't be dumb. Make the right choice. Save the Lemmings.   (CHRIST that took forever to edit out all of the ' and ")
