So I clicked on the link like right when he sends it to me and signed up.  I am gmailing!  Gmail is Google's new email and they give you 1 GB of mail (yes not a typo!) -  I plan on using it uh...a lot.    My office's air conditioner is not working well and after days and days of calling someone will be here today (supposedly) to fix it or at least look at it.  Let me tell u, in Dallas in summer, no A/C is a serious issue!  A Garage Sale is a distinct possibility this weekend.  Next weekend is booked and the weekend after may be booked also.  Where is this summer going?
