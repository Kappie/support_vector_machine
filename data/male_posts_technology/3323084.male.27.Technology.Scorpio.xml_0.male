Anyway, I keep hearing a friend of mine  urlLink Chris  talking about web standards and how important they are.  I heard him talk about a validator for his code so he could check his site for standards compliance.  So I got curious and decided to check it out.  I went to  urlLink http://validator.w3.org  it's a free Markup Validation Service from W3C.org.  All you have to do is put the URL of your site or get it a path to a file on your pc and it validates the code for compliance with web standards and displays the results.  First, I gave it the URL of this blog.  I was amazed to find that it found eleven errors in the code of this site.  I assumed that since the main underlying code for this blog was created by the pros at blogger.com it would comply with standards completely.  I was wrong, oh well.  Next I checked out the code for the website that I have been creating while learning about web design.  There are four main pages; they all had many errors at first.  But I began fixing problems until I had only a few problems that I had no idea how to fix.  I think they were CSS related but, I only just started reading a book on CSS.  So maybe sometime soon I'll be able to fix it all.  On one page though I was able to fix 100%, the page on Shady Lake.  The validator gave me some code to put on that page, a small emblem that I put at the bottom of the page showing W3C XHTML 1.1 Standards Compliance.  All in all I found it to be pretty neat to validate my code and an eye opener to proper coding.  If youâ€™re into coding your own html I recommend you check it out.  Until next time...
