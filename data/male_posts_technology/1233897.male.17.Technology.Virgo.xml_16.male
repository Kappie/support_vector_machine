Well at the moment I'm doing a major overhaul of my netowork infrastructure (IE: I'm installing a router), and I was forced to remove my blog for the computer I normally host it on... I'm thinking about backing up the databases though, not really sure.... I think I will.  Therefore I should still be able to get it back up and running quite quickly.
