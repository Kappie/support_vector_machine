They're royal and worthy by predetermination, and you have no right to challenge their authority. For they are the incompetent. All hail.  So it's about 6:00, closing time, when this idiot runs across the street towards the store. We groan and hope he doesn't come in, but of course, being an idiot, he does. He looks towards the cell phones, and making our fears come alive, announces his intent to buy one. Steve tells him we close in about 30 seconds, but that doesn't stop the moron from explaining how the last time he came in, we didn't have any free phones, so now he has the right to see what we just got in. So Steve, being the cool guy he is (no sarcasm, Steve's the man), showed the guy what we had and explained them with the best of his ability. Captain Special then proceded to say "I don't want to come in tomorrow and see that you've sold them all. What do I do?". I just rolled my eyes as Steve explained to him the slim probability of us selling two dozen cell phones in the span of one work day, but Dummy wasn't convinced. To shut him up, Steve gave him an info card to fill out to quicken the process of signing up tomorrow, and the guy began to fill it out. Then he paused and said "I'll just fill it out here... unless... you're closing or something...?" Steve said we closed about 5 minutes ago, and after more questioning, Special Boy finally left. You might think that was nothing to write an entire hate blog about, but when you've been working for six hours without eating for seven hours, all you want to do is leave. And you had to have been there to hate this guy. He was one of the people i described at the beginning. We're closed, but oh no, somehow he had a right to be there.  My venting doesn't stop there, and I'll try to keep this brief. By the way, after reading this next story, please comment on how you think I may have been at fault. Anyways, story #2... after eating at the Bayview, I had down time before Whitney got off work, so I decided to go to Quimper Sound. I turned right at the stoplight and saw that all the parallel parking spots by Quimper were full, but there were two ladies getting into their car in the first space, so I pulled up behind them in the Loading Zone to snag their spot when they left. I waited for a couple minutes and finally the started their car. They turned left to turn around, and I pulled in right behind them. I had my window rolled down, and so did the driver of the car, and I heard her talking. She said "Just in such a big hurry... blah blah blah". At the indirect mention of my name, I instinctively looked up and saw she was looking right at me. As she drove away, she yelled "Thanks for nothing!!!"... I just sat there, then I laughed. I have no clue what she was so mad about. The only conclusion I can think of is that me sitting behind them in the Loading Zone pressured her to move out of the space. But was I honking my horn and waving my fist, demanding that she get her ugly car out of the space? No. She was in a 2-hour parking space, and I wouldn't have cared less if she sat there for 3 hours. Quimper was gonna close in like 20 minutes, and if she wouldn't have moved within a few more minutes, I would have moved on to find more parking. I wasn't in that big of a hurry. Nobody held a friggin' gun to her head to give up her spot. She left, I took her spot, case closed. And I had to laugh, because the stupid old lady probably had a crappy day, and for some reason I had made her even more mad, so she had to shout something to vent her anger. And what ingenious phrase did she decide upon? "THANKS FOR NOTHING!!!"... What the CRAP does that have to do with the situation? Whatever. I understand I have no right to judge. Ms. Superior had a right to be randomly ticked off at me, I should've known right from the start. Ugh, superior people. Screw them all. You know what?    I    'm superior, so shut the #!%* up.   "I hate people..." "They're the worst!"
