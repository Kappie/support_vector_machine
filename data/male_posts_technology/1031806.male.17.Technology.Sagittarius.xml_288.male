I remember probably the happiest period of time in my life - the start of my 6th grade year and my all the new things it brought. I was so happy my first day of youth group (well, actually I as several other would be 6th graders had been attending for some time, but this was the first day we met at the then-new building, TVJA, and the first time I was technically part of the group. As time went on, I started developing my little nitch there - my friends (of whom Goody was my best), my role (sound guy)... and everything just fit together so happily. Life was pretty much care free back then, sure I had all the issues at home, in some ways better in many ways worse than now, but I didn't pay attention to them, they were just an annoyance that was gradually, without my seeing it, wearing me down.   Now though, everything's different, the only place I feel like I truly belong anymore is school, and not even so much there anymore... now that I'm like a 1.2 GPA student with a learning disability that seems to get me into trouble a lot. My core group of friends has changed to Cameran, Andrew, Steven, d'Dee (lol), Kristy, and assorted others. I've been through a short lived romantic relationship that has its definite plusses and minuses... I go to school again. (LOL, um yeah, I was home schooled for most of my life) I have a car, the lingering need to get a job, all the cares and worries of a teenager (plus some that hopefully the vast majority of us don't have to face), and I'm just generally having trouble coping with life. I have a rather irrational emotional complex that can change on a dime, but never allow me to show it.   I think really the first thing that needs changing to get my out of this rut of depression that I keep falling back into again is a spirit of thankfulness and trust that God is good and looking out for me even when I can't see it. This is tough however, when at times I'm finding myself doubting the very basis of faith that my hope rests on... Does God really exist? Is this all just something we make up to help us get through life, or is it real? These are questions that I struggle with fairly frequently and I really (no matter what it appears on the outside) don't think I've ever answered myself.  Pray for me will yah' guys? I need it, I really have no idea where my life's going right now and it scares me.
