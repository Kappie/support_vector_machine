Well well well. 1) James decided to cross the road at a non crossing point and we were nearly run down by a motorcyslist 2) while walking over the milliemememen bridge there was this HUGE fork of lightening the next bridge over so we stood to watch then realised we were on a metal bridge so promtly left 3) standing outside St Pauls and it starts to hail reeeeeeeeeeally heavily so all 3 of us squished into a phone box and then there was this huge FLASH and lightening struck St Pauls right next to us 4) on way through croydon James decided to run across the tram track and nearly got us run over  Thats 4 times I nearly died today. *cries*
