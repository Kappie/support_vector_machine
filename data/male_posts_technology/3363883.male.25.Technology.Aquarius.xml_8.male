I've been looking at other blog sties to see how people get started but there are no introductions; no nothing.  People just launch into their life storis.  I thought I'd give a quick review on who I am so the next couple of entries would make a remote bit of sense.  wibble wobble wibble wobble [ala Wayne's World style]  I'm a 25 year old sad little IT man.  Apart from being one of the dilbert look alike freaks, I'm an Australian trying to start up a career in Oxford, England.  I've been here two years now and have settled in somewhat. I come from Adealide in South Australia.  What's known as the "City of Churches".  Says it all really.  Nice place to drive through.  Maybe even bring your kids up.  Not a place to crack your first million by wheeling and dealing.  Still.  It's hard to find anyone nicer than in Adealide either so you take what you can get.  Being australian and in foreign parts, I tend to write large group emails out letting people know about my latest actions.  I've been doing this for a couple of years, and to be totally honest I'm finding it harder to get the motivation to write.  I thought I'd give this a wirl as an alternative.  Almost like an online diary even.  At least, I can remind myself of what's been happening the last couple of days because being pretty scatty sometimes I can forget the basics [breathing, working the legs etc...]  So sit back.  Enjoy the ride and I hope someone finds this little blog spot on the interesting side.
