Interesting day in all, encoutered the Warlingham May Queen, a very sexist man, and an old lady who links singing and bendy toilet brushes. Other than that the day was pretty routine, and I get to learn how to use the till next Saturday! How fun!! Sounds sad, but it all looks quite fun really, swiping credit cards and stuff!  Um. Other than that, I was awake half the night last night because I kept having dreams about the ball, and I was so excited about leaving I hardly slept a wink! Hope I get some more sleep before Friday, otherwise I won't make it to the ball! Anyway, we're having a ridiculoursly early dinner otnight cos Nancy has friends round, so better go! Byeeeeee. BTW, see you 10,.30 tomorrow morning Jackie!
