A guy rapes and murders a 14 year old girl and our judicial system takes years to reach a final decision for such a henious crime and Mr. President jumps in between to put a stay on it. Dhananjay is supposed to be hanged till death and why not ?  Think of the girl who died .. Think of the parents of the girl who are facing the trauma since this incident has happened... Think of the cold - blooded murderer...and then eventually, you would also agree with the  court's decision.. Human right activists are crying over dhananjay's rights to live that he has already served so many years in prison during the trial ? but these fuckin' asshole activists are the people who'll arrive in AC cars, drink coke, make a lot of noise in public and go back in the same AC cars to attend a party in the evening.  why didn't these activists think about the rights to live of that girl , Hetal Parekh.? These activists are a bunch of some high class socialite ladies who have nothing to do btu want to be in news. So sometimes, they think of shifting their pictures from page 3 to page 1. that's all .. nothing much they need from dhananjay's case..   Dhananjay just deserves to be   HANGED TILL DEATH
