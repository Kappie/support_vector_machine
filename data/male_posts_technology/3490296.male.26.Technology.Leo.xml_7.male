Nothing unusual happened but it was really great fun, teasing one another whilst fishing and chatting. Yes, you know this ain't the main course for the blog. :)   Of all my girlfriends, there are two of whom i had deep regrets. One of them is Junie, the gf i had when i was J2 and she was in YJC in the 1st 3 mths. Got to know her thru' my help out to my friend's OG. We broke up because she wanted to go TPJC and it would be diffcult to maintain the relationship. It was absolutely silly because Singapore isn't really big. Her birthday is near and i called her to see if i can catch up with her, also to give her birthday greetings. But, her phone number changed and its another person taking up the call. I realised, i havn't been calling for the past 6 mths because i would be able to realise this problem if i did. Fate ended. *alas.. sigh*  The 2nd one happened 4 years ago, when i was serving my NS and, she was Sec 2 in CHIJ TP. We broke because of the major age differences but i didn't tell her the truth until last year i think. Nevertheless, it is too late. She already has a boyfriend who is very much older than me too... That is not important too, because the important thing is, she loves him. I called her and her number remained the same..   She remembered and recognise my voice. The last time we chatted was more than a year ago. And that time, she also recognised me. My father's funeral, she dropped by after i sent her an SMS. If you are to ask me why i broke up with her since she is so good, my answer would be, i was silly. And of course, its all past. Although i still kept the sweet email we used to send one another during those days because her parents were very strict on her. Yes, it was very sweet but i didn't realise it. I'm always this silly..  As a man grows older, he tend to need more friends who understands him than lovers. Because i have lost my desire and affections towards lovers, *i think i do* i need my old friends and pple who understands me. I'm glad that she still listens to me but i didn't know how much she had changed. But, this time i will know.   Friendship is rare, especially when you gets older.   Hap: What about lovers? DJ : Lovers only appear in fantasy. I don't have my hopes anymore. Hap: What about her? DJ : Mandy? She loves her boyfriend.  Hap: And you don't mind he mistreats her like that? DJ : I can't determine her road. She has her own life. Hap: Don't you love her? DJ : Ya, but she doesn't. Lol. So, i will try to forget her. Hap: Do you think you can? DJ : No... but i will do my best.   ------------------End of Interview--------------------- "P  Love, DJ
