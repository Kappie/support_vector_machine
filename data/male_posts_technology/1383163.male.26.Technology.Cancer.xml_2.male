But before we do that, let's get acquainted with the basic layout of Powerpoint.   Note: I work on Office XP and hence all the lessons/features will relate to the XP version of Powerpoint. There would be some feature mismatches in other versions; however the basic stuff remains the same.  Take a look at  urlLink this ...  I am following a general schema that segregates the various tools, based on categories such as graphic, text etc. I have highlighted them in the picture. I use 1024X768 resolution for my PC screen so that allows me to add more icons on the tabs provided.  So how do you go about getting this layout? Well, for starters, click on the Powerpoint icon in your Start Menu/Programs. You will see a layout not dissimilar to the one I have. Next, you right click on one of the tabs on the top and click on Customize. Then click on FORMAT and drag'n'drop the various icons onto the relevant areas in Powerpoint.  The 'Align and Distribute' icon however can't be found in the FORMAT option (not in XP at least). You can find it under the 'Draw' icon on the bottom left extreme of the page.  I will elaborate on the uses of these icons as we go along.
