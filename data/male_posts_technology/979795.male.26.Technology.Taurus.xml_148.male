How could this possibly have anything to do with Aikido?"  "O-Sensei always said "Aikido wa budo de aru". And what I felt he really meant was, "This is a martial art and if it doesn't work, take up aerobics, take up dance, or take up a gun! But don't call it the Martial Arts. Aikido is a Martial Art."    -- Steven Seagal, 7th dan, Shihan, Shinto priest
