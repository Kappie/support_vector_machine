Last weekend I invited one of my boss and english accent tutor, Sophie for dinner. They wanted to try real indian hot and spicy food. so in the 'enthu' we put more spice than normal....u should have seen the way they were eatin...emptied my whole bunch of tissue rolls...waters from eyes, nose....had nice fun watching them.....Sophie has real passion for Saree and went on to try one of my saree and to my disgust amd Boomi's surprise it perfectly suited her!!! Busy looking for some job opportunities..... Vijay Babu nanga frequenta blog pannalennu ippadi yellam bayam puduthatha.....  bye
