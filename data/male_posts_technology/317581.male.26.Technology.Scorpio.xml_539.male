Maybe they're right, you can only find love once you stop looking.   Maybe they're the people that think I'm a "nice" person, but not the "date"-able type.  About as exciting as a wet sponge? At least I try. I have THAT going for me. I know a lot of people that don't even do that.  My pomade smells good. Peace- T
