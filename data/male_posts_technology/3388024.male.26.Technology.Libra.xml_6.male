Its been through a few upgrades to keep it functional over the years, new video card, more RAM, and a new hard drive recently.  But I guess no matter what you bolt onto a Pinto, it’s still a Pinto. The wife says it’s prone to random issues and something about a sticker stuck in the CD drive.   So I ordered some new parts today from  urlLink Newegg.com .  I used to be loyal to  urlLink compuplus.com  but my friend Brian turned me on to the egg.  I bought the bits for my  urlLink shiny computer of total goodness  from them and I was very happy.  My DVD drive died at one point and it was a synch to get it replaced.  I highly recommend them.  For the geeky out there I went with the AMD 2500+ Barton CPU.  Same one I have.  Pared it with and Abit board and 512mb of PC2700 ram.  This, with the 80gig 7200 rpm drive she has, should make quite an improvement.    I’d have to say the best find was the  urlLink Lite-On CD-RW/DVD+/-RW  drive for under $80.  The reviews for the drive on the site were great and it seems to work with pretty much any format.  I opted to spend the extra $10 for a faster drive, but not the extra $5 for the Retail packaging.  I guess well see how it works, but I must say I’m excited to see how the new DVD writer works with this other  urlLink software  I think I’m gonna pick up also.
