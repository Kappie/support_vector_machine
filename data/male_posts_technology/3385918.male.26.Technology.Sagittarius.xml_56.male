He began to talk to them and asked them to define the word ''tragedy.''  "Well," one girl replied, "If my mommy ran over my dog, Rover, that would be a tragedy!"  The President smiled at the little girl and said, "No, sweetie. That would be an accident! Can anyone give it a try?"  A little boy sitting across the room raised his hand and said, "I know! I know! If our bus driver ran off of a cliff and killed everyone!"  The President shook his head and said, "No son. That would be a great loss! Doesn't anyone know of a good example of a tragedy?"  A small girl raised her hand and said, "Well, Mr. President, if you and Laura were in Air Force One and it was hit by a missile and blown to smithereens, most people would think that that was a tragedy!"  "Very good," he said. "And what was your reason for that answer?"  "Well," she said, "It would not be an accident and it sure would not be a great loss!"
