You can spend a few days searching for a solution but ends up with nothing or worse when you end up with no solutions thanks to Micr0s0ft Product. But with this little bit of touch of luck, you can just solved it within minutes. I really appreciate it.  As usual I am late for work, I always do not want to be late. But seems like the more I do not want to be late the more later i reach my office. Thanks to understanding Boss, which i seem to taken for granted, everything went normal.  Went to Adrian and Jen House to become Shrimp Dumpling Noodle Chef. I need a lower quality pot instead of this thick base pot for tracing the readiness of the noodle. It was a rush day and in fact I did not go for my SAT lessons. I kind of worried as my idiot (pronounce as ee-D-york) lecturer been missing two previous lessons.  By the time I am typing these my head is spinning badly after chatting with my Secondary School friends. Adios I will be back for more!
