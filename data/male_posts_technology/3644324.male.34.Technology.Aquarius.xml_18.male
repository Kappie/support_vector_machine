Mostly I'm just a bit worn out from my long days and thought that today would be a good recuperation day and the place I'm staying is run by a ridiculously nice couple - the man did a little dance when I asked if I could stay a second day (okay the dance was because my staying meant he could put up the "No Vacancy" sign and relax today without worrying about an empty room but I still got a huge kick out of it).   Today I'm taking it easy by walking to Loch Ness and poking around in the Inverness Highland Museum. Then I plan to grab a coffee and sit and write in a coffee shop for four hours. Unfortunately, unlike your experiences in Vancouver,I suspect that there will be nary a single nubile young thing in a bicini to distract me. At best I suspect I'll be bothered by some Italian bitch (strong word but I've run into Italians everywhere on this trip and they have surpassed Americans for being the most annoying peoples on the planet) attempting to walk through me - theyseem to think that everyone else will just get out of their way. (that sounds a lot more bitter than I actually feel - I'm just fascinated by the way they seem to interact with the world - so not Canadian - yet most Italians in Canada are the nicest people - double fascinating - do the nice ones flee Italy in disgust at all the rude idiots - I'll have to investigate when I get home)   That's my entire day plan.   Tomorrow I'm heading to Fort William and if I'm feeling spry I'll climb to the highest point in Britian (along with the 70,000 other folks who do it every year) and then climb something else.   Monday I plan to head back south to Stirling and see the William Wallace monument and bop through Stirling castle.   Tuesday I'm heading back to Glasgow to see if I like it better when not jetlagged and suffering from an anxiety disorder.   Wednesday I'm winging home to the people I love.   I considered having a Frappacino here but I did some math and realized that it would probably be cheaper to fly to Vancouver, order it there, then fly back to Scotland with it than to order it here. How the hell to people live here when a Frap costs $8. It isn't civil. I think that maybe that whole "Emptying the Highlands" by the government and rich land-owner's story is over-sold and the reason all the Scots left is because they heard about cheap frozen coffee in Canada.   Glad to hear that the weather is nice at home. I had to put on the visor a few times here to keep from further burning my face - which also has the added bonus of making me look like a bigger freak. It would appear that I am the only person in the entire country to ever wear one by the looks I've been getting when I have it on. That and the elderly Scottish folk, of which there are many, many, many, are all about 4'9", and can't resist commenting to their friends on my immense size (they do it discreetly though, in booming whispers to their hard-of-hearing companions - audible to anyone within a 30 foot radius).
