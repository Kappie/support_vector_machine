For instance, when a little girl, who has repeated the third grade four times looks up at me with her pudgy doe eyes and says, " this program is boring " or " I don't know how to do this."  And this is in despite of the fact that the directions are right there in front of her crack laced eyes.  I just want to say " Shut up you lazy as retard, I have had shits that were smarter than you.  Now get to work Bertha."  But no, I never can have that pleasure, and that is why I hate working at a school.  If natural selection was the option here, we would be dragging these poor pathetic little pieces of dung out to the street and shooting them.  There are those times that I wish I was the guy in Dead Alive, so that I could walk in one day with a lawnmower and puree their asses.  Baby back ribs anyone.  Okay I jest… besides this would probably be considered low quality beef.  And there are the teachers…. I have this one that for the life of me can't remember my last name…. I believe she has called me every last name in the book…. Yes I have told her my name… I have even interrupted her in the middle of calling my name to tell her it…  Maybe I should carve it into her forehead like henry bowers does to Ben Hanscom in IT…. I mean seriously…  And there is this other teacher, who for some reason always treats me like a child.  This frankly annoys the piss out of me, but she is hot.  And I mean with a capital H… but she is still annoying… I wish I could just smack her around a little and tell her to suck it…. Oh well… I guess in the end, this job is not that bad.  However, it does have its negatives.  Oh well, it could be worse and I could be working at publix.  Well that's it for now. fashizzle
