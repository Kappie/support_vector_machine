I'm working on moving exclusively to Firefox as of right now)    I made the most bomb breakfast this morning. I love scrambles. I love over easy eggs. Why has no one combined the two before? Maybe they have, I don’t know.  Regardless of the novelty, that is exactly what I made this morning  Green onions, mushrooms, hash browns, cheese, and a few eggs offering up their gooey goodness.     “They don’t even have a dining room.”      * * *
