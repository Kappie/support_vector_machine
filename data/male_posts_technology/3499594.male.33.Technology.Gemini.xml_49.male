I received an IM from the hospital stating their all duplicated charges/credits.   I was totally frustrated. So basically it was for nothing and I had now more work to do. Fortunately the interface was still there and I only needed to restart it. But I had to go into each batch (a data file full of 48 ((charges)) and 49 ((credits)) records.    It was not a good morning.   Its now midnight and I cant sleep for nothing. I laid in bed well over an hour, so figured I can blog. I have tomorrow then I am off for awhile. I can't wait.   I went to the chiropractor today. I never been to one. I have an old sport injury in my rt wrist and it's probably carpal tunnel settling in. I picked up a case of bottle water the other day and it hurt like hell. I must have kinked it. I also have a sore spot under my rt shoulder blade, that's been going on for a week. I kept thinking its a pulled muscle, but it just wont go away. The past two days, I've taken loracet and Celebrex to ease the pain.  My wife has gone to him and speaks highly of his practice. So anyway, I went today and he put a electric box to my back shoulder muscles. It's not a tinge unit but something else. Supposedly this continues to work after its turned off. I don't know. I know I cant sleep worth a flip and I can't take a tylenol pm due to being on-call tonight. It sucks.  I also know my back is still sore and he is suppose to adjust me in the morning. I guess we will see. Guess, I will flip the tv in the living room since everyone is asleep and I don't want to wake the wife.
