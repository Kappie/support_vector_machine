Akcron went to assist Konath with the resurrection, while I went to the Bazaar and found Akcron some better equipment for her hands and feet.   I bought Akcron 800 platinum worth of fine quality armor, and arrived back in Dreadlands to accompany them to the giant fort. Konath unfortunately did not have SoW, and Kretais was in trouble, being low on mana, and stuck in the Fort with no Melee assistance. I decided to leave Konath in the dust to make my way into the Fort, there was a lot of angry enemies to dodge, before I made it inside, and even once we arrived, the giants were very angry and in large number, we nearly lost our lives if not for the assistance of Akcron and her healing.   We eventually settled in and I received the necessary buffs to keep my abilities sharp, and my trusty Hammer of Silent Screams awake with healing power. We took out quite a few angry Giants while there, and picked up a Beastlord Jaggur Meister for a short time. Eventually he had to leave, Konath had left to hand in a piece of his epic to someone, so we decided it might be best to head out to Permafrost to help Konath further his pursuit to his epic.   We arrived in Everfrost Peaks, fought off some orcs and pumas. and eventually entered Permafrost. The goblins were unprepared for battle, not that goblins have much in the way of brains to plan a decent defense. We slaughtered them for quite some time, and Akcron, seeing no real need for her talents, gated and camped for the evening. While we camped a ritual site for the wizards of the Goblin horde. Kretais had called for a druid to assist us with tracking and killing the goblins, and eventually we got the frozen heart we were looking for.   After destroying the Goblins, we made our way deeper into Permafrost to assualt the Ice Giants, we killed several before we found one that had the block of permafrost we needed. It was here that I learned that these Goblins and Ice Giants worked for "the ice witch" also known as Lady Vox! Lady Vox is a dragon, and one that I must kill in an attempt to retreive the portion of a book I need to strengthen soulfire once I have completed that item.  We decided tonight was not the night to assualt the Ice Witch, so we heading out via the Druid teleporting us to the Nexus. After the teleport Kretais made camp, and Reiahla left us as well. Konath and I being the sole members of the group left, attempted to find someone willing to spelunk the Dungeons of Norrath, but no one was to be found. So we setup, and made a dash for Dulak, while the buffs Kretais applied still held. we made it quite easily, but the fight to find a safe spot to battle was more difficult.  I imagined it would be easiest to go toward the docks, then across to the warehouses. we fought our way to the docks, and nearly died in doing so, my hammer was helping, and Konath had bandages and was doing a reasonable job of patching me up after battle. eventually I got enough mana to cast my soothing spell, and I began to slowing manuever and soothe our way past the dock workers.  I spotted a Dock guard and began casting my soothe, my soothe did not hold on him, I could tell by his glare from that distance, so me and Konath began backing up quickly, until the guard stopped at his post. I began to attempt to make a group of dock hands soothed, but the guard started walking again! I held my breath as me and Konath slammed against the wooden building behind us, Konath was good at sneaking and so made sure to make use of this skill while we held still against that building, not breathing. It seemed like forever before he began to take off, but he did, and so did the other guard that showed up a bit later.  we safely made our way to the warehouse, I felt as though my sturdy stature could not hold my jumping heart! but we made it, and met up eventually with a cleric, and a few others began to join our group. We fought valiantly, and I grew stronger in doing so, we ended up with many treasures that night, and eventually Konath had to pack it in for the night. I understood, and so we both made camp that night in Dulak.   If ever shall we meet may it be as Brothers, and not as Enemies, Ziggur Rathebringer
