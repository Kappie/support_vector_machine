As I type this, all types of jet (and non-jet) aircraft are flying past my window. I'm going to run to the roof of my building in a second to catch some of it.  A few weeks ago there was an Indy auto race. The sounds of high-rev engines waffling through my window.  And after today, all the tourists will go home and I will have the waterfront to myself for a few weeks before it gets too cold...
