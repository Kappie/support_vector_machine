I'll answer all potential questions in a Q  A.   Q: Why are you going?   A: I'm part of the New York Times Regional Newspaper Group emergency team along the Gulf Coast. If there's a decent Hurricane or equivalent catastrophe, I'm there with fellow team members Diane (reporter) and Scott (photographer). I am the third wheel due to my knowledge of the network system.   Q: What's your job?   A: I'm there to make sure the wireless connections will be supported. I call around to hotels on the Island to see which have the capabilities of keeping our network afloat. Then I book three rooms (one for Diane, one for Scott and I and one for the computers, etc.) and find an electrician that can wire the place if it isn't wired. From there I'm strictly a watchdog. I keep charges in the laptops, communications with the editors at the desk, give them weather updates, check the network, check the net to track the storm and transmit the stories from our location to the group.   Q: What happens if something goes wrong?   A: The only three things that can go wrong are: flooding and pipes busting can take away my plan B (landlines); the hotel collapses (I'll die) and the power goes out (thus I lose my wireless capabilities and we're forced to run our laptops on battery and use the landlines. If the landlines are floodieed we'll have to send from a pay phone, which use old ,old lines that can even stand up in the most violent flooding.   Q: How bad is this Hurricane?   A: Looks like an ambitious Cat 2, which means the winds will hit around 90-100 MPH. That's pretty nice but nowhere near as bad as Hurricanes like  urlLink Gilbert  in 1989 and of course  urlLink Andrew  in 1992, Gilbert was a Cat 4 when it made American landfall and Andrew was a moderate Cat 5. This Hurricane isn't close to that.   Q: Are you scared?   A: Not really, I'm more excited than anything else. I'll be fine.   Q: When kind of supplies do you bring for this sort of trip?   A: Well I use the basic Hurricane emergency guidelines. I should be back tomorrow evening or Saturday morning but I'm still packing for four days in case the roads need a day to be cleared or something. I have about 12 gallons of water, lots of canned foods, first-aid kits, towels, etc. Nothing out of the ordinary for an emergency kit.   Q: If I see you tonight on TCZ what do I do?   A: Say hi. I'm stuck in a room chilled to the bone (for the computers) while Diane and Scott are probably in the hotel lobby drinking and whooping it up with the Weather Channel people. I have a high speed and hotel cable so chances are I'm bored to tears.   Q: Who watches your dogs?   A: I'm pysched I have a new housesitter since my old one got pregnant and married on me. Hopefully the house will be in one piece when I get back and it seems like my dogs love the sitter so that's the least of my worries. If that falls through, I'll take them with me.  I'll have more exciting details later. If I'm on and can give a blow by blow of the Hurricane as it hits, that'll be even better.  Peace!
