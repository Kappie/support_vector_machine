That is good because I get paid overtime and its extra because its a Sunday. Btw Jackie, Pam was asking Lora about you. My day was fine. Right now I am not impressed as I am cold, I burnt my pizza again and I have just been attacked by a huge spider and now I am kinda depressed at James, Jon and Leon because I don't liek people hating me or hating me for no reason. Argh.
