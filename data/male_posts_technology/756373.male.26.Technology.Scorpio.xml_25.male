At first , it was fun, everyone played fairly and empires rose and fell like the tides. But I play it no longer. Recently, a group going by the name of Chaos rose and took up all the top 20 odd slots. And the only explanation would be cheating. By registering numerous 'empires' per person, they could use their bogus empires to send their 'real' empire shipments of weapons, money and food. It's blatant cheating. And nothing is being done about it, because it's hard to prove - merely sign up your 'feeder' empires using a bogus email addy and you can't be touched. Whoever thought up that stupid adage 'Cheaters never prosper' must have been living on cloud fucking 9 or something. This is the REAL world! Cheaters ALWAYS prosper! The wallhack using Counterstrike punk ALWAYS wins, and with the latest OGC hack not much can be done to prove anything. How about a real-life example? Second hand car salesmen. Oh yes, cheaters extroardinaire, filling radiators with oil and using straw to silence knocks. 3 weeks after buying the car , you find out that the thing is a lemon, and you can't do jack shit about it. Hell even big business is in on the cheating game. I've bought a few things from this 'Verimark' company (eventually learning my lesson) , the one with all the infomercials on TV, and 9 out of 10 times the stuff is sheer, utter junk incapable of coming CLOSE to fulfilling all those promises stated on the googlebox. They all come with money back guarantees, but just TRY and send something back to them via the mail... you never hear from them, and if you try and phone them they claim they never received the item or, better yet, they received the item AFTER it's 14-day money-back guarantee expired. Hello? Do these fuckwits honestly expect the postal system to deliver an item to them in less than 14 days?!!?  If I had my way I'd line up all the Promisance cheaters, Counterstrike script kiddies, Warcraft 3 maphackers, used car salesmen, Verimark employees and televangelists, and break each and every fucking one of their kneecaps with a baseball bat. I mean, what the  fuck  is wrong with people?! Cheating is wrong! Ripping off your fellow man is wrong! Didn't your parents teach you ANYTHING?!? Sometimes have so little faith in the human race...
