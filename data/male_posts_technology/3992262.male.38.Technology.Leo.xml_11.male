Enough with the left-wing propaganda, MAKE ME LAUGH!  What I love is the response to a company that decides not to do business with a big Lib like Trudeau gets from other big Lib's.  They shout censorship, like a company ending a contract is keeping Trudeau from saying his opinion.  HEY ALL YOU LIBS!  He's NOT going to JAIL, he's getting FIRED!  There's a distinct difference!  I like the way Rush put it, "You don't have a Constitutional Right to be heard."
