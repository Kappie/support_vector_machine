I say inner body infection - because - to be honest - I have lied to some of you as to where the infection actually was. Partly to hide my own embarrassment - partly to shield your fragile young minds.  I am happy to report - there is now only minor swelling and pain, and I can eat some solid foods again.  Also, my mind (which was the second most affected part of my body) is now fully back to functioning capacity - thus the blog posts should start to pour out of me in the very near future!  I don't have any spectacular adventures to report on from this passed weekend - I did go to theatre sports as a 3rd wheel (always a pleasure when it's with Amn and Heather - heck I could even be her other boyfriend) - we all went out for gelato after the show - I was a gelato virgin - it was damn good... then I went to the fireworks on Saturday - which was awesome - however, I'm sure the walking only worsened my condition... I then followed this up with sleep on Sunday - mixed up with cold sweats and feverish head rushes... thank goodness Monday was a holiday - I spent the day watching movies on PPV and calling Shaw to tell them it wasn't working - and getting some of them for free!  Now I am back on track - still walking a little funny - but I am sure I will be ready to get my tattoo done on Saturday.  I would like to thank all of you for sending me the lovely cards, flowers and balloons. It brightens up my day having them all over my room. :)  I should also mention - to all the ladies out there... oddly enough - the infection has had the most wondrous affect on my manhood - when I get excited it now swells to 14 times it's natural size!
