I'll keep posting the details of the days that we have together, he has a tendency of doing this, since his schedule is so hectic most of the time and he's so occupied, whenever he gets a bunch of days off stretched out for a while(july 4th holiday) he hooks up with us so we can do some serious LAN gaming. it's fun, and it never seems to last long enough. We miss him often when he's gone, and we enjoy every moment that he's in our home. I'll keep you posted as things develop.  Try not to Feed the Stupid People, Phoenix
