An acquaintance who is by no means a friend of ours, we will just call him KB, came into the bar with a tough meathead i kick asses and take names look all over his face. Then I heard a little giggle and a murmur behind me coming from the bartender. giggle giggle...look...haha...his collar.  Thats right my friends, KB was rockin the popped collar.      The popped collar look is making a tragic come back. I dont know if its a geographical thing, a tough guy thing, a fonzie is cool and i am too kinda thing, but this fashion disturbance needs to be halted, maimed, beaten, and thrown in the attic faster than a redheaded stepchild.  Its happening all over the country. Read what one Penn Business School student had to say about it:  Boys with pastel colored polo shirts, collar turned up in that "I'm-trying-to-look-like-I-don't-care-but-it-took-more-time-to-arrange-this-damned-collar-up" way. -- Charlene Ong, Wharton 2006    excerpt from thirtyfourth street magazine, philly  Thats right Charlene, its a travesty. Check out this coked out, washed out actor you might recognize from waynes world, tommy boy, or west wing.       I cant stress enough the need to get rid of this look. Or at least laugh out loud at the people who are trying to revive it when you see them again in a bar. No hitting a guy with glasses? aww horeshit, this guy needs one in the mouth and one in the stomach.          urlLink Funny article  from another college campus  Some words from the opposing viewpoint... urlLink real intelligent   An Entire urlLink  Online Club  devoted to hating on Popped Collars   urlLink A Little History Lesson  from someone a little older, a little more in tune.
