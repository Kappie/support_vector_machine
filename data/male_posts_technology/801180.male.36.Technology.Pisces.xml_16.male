This bothers me more than normal cos its my 35th birthday tomorrow, and I just wanted an easy day in the office!  I've had a number of particularly crap weeks, so I just want a little slack cut - but that just ain't gonna happen....  Oh well, Jo is out with her friends tonight, so its a number of bottles of old speckled hen for me!  The good news is that through some watching of diet, I am now down to 15 stone - I've actually lost 2 stone since Christmas - I'm quite impressed with myself!  Will it last?  I like to think so, but I am not promising anything!!
