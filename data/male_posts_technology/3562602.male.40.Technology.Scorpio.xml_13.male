Nick proved to be very helpful also.  The family room looks great, even though it needs a coat of paint.  Went to bed around 11:00 p.m.  Saturday morning we got up around 9:00 a.m. to start yard work.  Nick and I trimmed the bushes.  We got the bushes trimmed in front of the living room when I decided to try a gas powered hedge trimmer.  Nick called Nickel rental and was told they had one in stock, but when we got there none was available.  Piss ants!  We proceeded over to Abra Autobody to get some stuff that I left in the car they found when repairing the bumper...keys.  Then down 29 bypass to Coweta Equipment rental.  They had one.  We rented it for 4 hours.  It made quick work on the bushes and we were done by 12:45.  We returned the trimmer and stopped at Lowes to get some weed killer and garden gloves.  Then off to the movie theatre.  We saw Spiderman 2.  I saw it for the second time.  I think I feel asleep during part of the movie.  Nick enjoyed the flick.  We had Coke and popcorn as a snack.  This was essentially lunch.    Then back home to pick up the trimmings.  This took a couple more hours.  Nick was a great help today.  We barely spook an ill word to eachother.  It's nice to work with him without arguing all the time.  The little trailer we borrowed from friends kept opening and dumping its contents.  This got to be a real pain.  Tomorrow were going to rig it closed permanently.     I then mowed the front and side lawn.  This takes no time at all on the new zero turn mower.  Nick found himself some dinner while I finished the lawn.  From the front of the house it looks great if I say so myself.  The hedges are trimmed.  The house painters are coming Monday and I wanted to make sure the hedges didn't get in their way.  The hedges got a little butchered, but I think they'll survive.  Had salad and leftover grilled chicken for dinner.  Very tasty.  C called Nick to say good night, but failed to say a single word to me.  I feel very hurt.  I immediately called her back but she wouldn't answer the phone.  So, I left a message that said "You're mean!" and hung up.  Apparently C got the message.  She just called and informed me that she was walking into a store and told Nick that she'd call me later.  I asked Nick and he corroborated her story.  So much for that, C'll call later and we can talk then.  Going to watch TV the rest of the night and go to bed.  Off to church in the morning.  A busy day in the yard with a little movie break.  Till next time...  Kevin
