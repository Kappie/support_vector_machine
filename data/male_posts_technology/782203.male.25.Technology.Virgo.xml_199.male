But honestly I dun think so cos I dun use ICQ at work at all eventhough I could if I wanted to. So I think its more of a lack of a social life rather than an addiction. :(  But going to shoot pool later with 2 ...err...net friends. And I am gonna suck really badly cos I only played pool like once in my life. Why don't they have carrom in those places, I am really good at that, I was my kindergarden champion ok dun play play!
