I remember seeing such aquariums in Discovery Channel and National Geographic.  jax, for the short-bio, it wud be better if someone else writes for others... that way its likely to make more interesting reading...  and here's my   Ponder of the day...    Why is "number" abbreviated as "no"? When there is no "o" in number?
