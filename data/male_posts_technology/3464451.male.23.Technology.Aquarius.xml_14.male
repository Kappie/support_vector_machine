Partied the last two nights.  SWEET, VERY SWEET!!!   I hope everything is going well with you all!   well, my week as a tech manager I guess ended on a good note.   even though we have been really busy and I still haven't been able to catch up with the work that I have, but that's all right. As long as I have all this work to do, I will always have a job right? I have been in a lonesome mood the last couple of days.  I hate being alone and ya know, I don't just want anyone, I want someone!  But I'm really shy so it's really hard for me to meet people!!!   So, I guess I wish sometimes a girl would walk up to me and be like hey, how are you??  and just surprise me and be interested in me ya know?  Her chase me for once!  that would be awesome!  but hey, sometimes we don't get what we want right? well, I am yawning a lot so I better get some sleep for work tomorrow. my boss comes back and I guess he will evaluate my work I guess..... well, take care! ;)
