Working might not be the right word though, I'm actually doing an internship for my master thesis. With some luck I'm graduating from  urlLink Ecole des Mines  in September.   I've only got 2 weeks left, and they fkin dumpt a shitload of work on me today, so I decided to blog. Vengeance with a twist.
