While Sony doesn't "own" the PDA market, they were the most innovative (doing things like adding MP3 capability, colour, external memory storage, etc).  One of the most annoying aspects of Sony's innovations is that they tended to be highly  urlLink propietary .  Examples would be only supporting Memory Stick, poorly documented methods to program their PDAs, etc.  What this tended to do was cause you to  always  turn to Sony for solutions to their products, as they were the only ones providing them.  Who knows?  Maybe this will spurn other manufacturers to pick up the ball.  Sony has been the only real manufacturer innovating on the Palm-based PDA line, and I think it's high time for someone else to step into the ring.  PS: I personally own, and love, my PEG-N760C Clie. It was one of the first to play MP3 files, accepted external storage and also play videos. I'm about ready to move on to a newer unit, and must also admit I'll probably be looking away from Sony for my solution. Sony's gear is just too damn proprietary, often making the premium price one pays for it not really worth it in the long run (What happened to all those nifty memory-stick-based gadgets that were promised years ago?). One thing I definately will insist on, though, is the ability to play MP3 files. Having PDAs serve this dual-purpose just makes sense.
