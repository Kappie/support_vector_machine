Where I used to spend two hours in front of the computer every day reading news off the AP wire and through a subscription to the Wall Street Journal online I now wake up at 05:00 every day in order to give myself an hour to read through The New York Times—in print! I then spend an hour at lunch doing the same with The Wall Street Journal—again in print.   In addition, instead of spending an hour every day playing mindless online games (like “bejeweled” or “alchemy”) I now spend as much time doing the NY Times crossword puzzle. Oh it’s not much less mindless—I cheat shamelessly.   Have I lost my technophilia? I sometimes go days without sitting at my home PC! It was once my best friend.   Perhaps.   It certainly isn’t information overload. The information on the web just isn’t as good or as accessible as it used to be. Try searching for something—Google, MSN, Yahoo, it doesn’t matter; ads are the first thing you see. They’ve skewed the results.   I could just read quality online, though—I still subscribe to WSJ online and the NY Times is free. Well, sort of. Free if you can ignore the flashing banners. At least the print versions have the decency to make the ads visually attractive. And the layout in print lends itself to reading better than online. Too much time staring at the computer all day as it is, my eyes need a break.   I think, in the end, it is about quality. Read Yahoo news and you get up to the minute crap. Everyone repeats the same story on their own sites, exactly as the AP wrote it. Do a search sometime for a string of words from an article, see how many times it shows up exactly as printed. Sure the NY Times has had some egg on its face of late (nothing like the Post though! Way to go Rupert!) but they also have quite a string of wins to their credit. And the right-leaning WSJ? Well, I just skip the editorial pages… at least they aren’t owned by News corp.   The strange thing is that by reading the print news I seem to find stories that no one of my technophile peers has seen or read. And I’ve read all the stories that they do. It’s, by analogy, like bio-diversity. They read their homogenous, wide-spread, manufactured, news and think that they have a good grasp on things. I read my “heirloom” news, old seeds, developed for flavor and resistance, and end up always being immune to the information bugs that wipe them out.   As for crosswords, well, I guess I just like to intimidate people. I’m not really all that smart, I just play like I am. Did I mention that I keep the crossword on my desk all day? That I carry it to meetings? No? hmmmm. Must be slipping….
