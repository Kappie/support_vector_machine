I'm wondering what the future holds  And I'm wondering who, if anyone reads this. I've given the link, but I'm sure it's been long lost and long forgotten. After all, these are just the ramblings of Alex Arsenault.  Not to say this negatively, but it seems people have always thought of me as a lesser form of a human, when in reality, they don't know that I'm quite the opposite.  And when they get a chance to figure that out, they don't.  Because they don't want to know!  :P Don't worry, I'm in a good mood still, I don't give a fuck who reads this  or  what they think. Well... unless it's positive of course. I never get comments :'(
