I have many good stories from that first semester away from home to write down.  Anyway, I ate regularly at the UNR Dining Commons (aka Dysentery Commons) because it was included with the dorm.  Two bad experiences:  There was one lady working there who apparently had plucked her eyebrows off, or else they were burned off in a kitchen accident.  (Why women pluck, I will never know.)  Then as part of her makeup ritual, she painted on new eyebrows with what appeared to be 90W gear oil.  She always seemed to be working around the steamed vegetables, steamed corn, green beans, or peas, where the steamer pan is set into the steel countertop which contains hot, steaming water.  The steamer was in a small side room, and all that steam and humidity made it very warm, and people, including the eyebrow lady, would sweat.  When she started sweating, and the steam hit her face, the painted-on eyebrows started running down her face, looking like stained tears from alien eyes.  The eyebrows ran into her eye and down her cheek.  I don't know if any of the eyebrows made it into the steamed vegetables or not, but I know I skipped steamed vegetables after seeing her working.  Another time, after eating lunch at the DC, I didn't feel so good.  I went back to my room and went to sleep.  I woke up two and a half days later, undressed, with a few concerned friends sitting around.  They told me I was delirious and had a high fever the whole time.  My friends Becky and Tracy had taken off my clothes to help me stay cool from the fever, but I never knew it.  (They never told me if they did anything to me while I was asleep and undressed, but they seemed to enjoy whatever happened.)  They said that they were ready to call for medical help if I had not woke up when I did.  Apparently I had got bad mayonnaise or mold or maybe salmonella from something.  The funny thing is, I don't remember getting up to use the bathroom (outside the room, down the hall) the whole time.  Anyway, be careful of food!
