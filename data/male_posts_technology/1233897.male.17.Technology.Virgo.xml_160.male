My dad wants to keep it in the garage untill we get it cleaned up, but then I hope to move it to the main area in the basement. (There's a slight possibility that it won't fit into the basement door, so we may have to put it on the main floor.) :D  btw, I posted a new song to my blog last post, but forgot to post the lyics *gasp* Soooo, here they are:   Lifehouse - Hanging by a Moment   Desperate for changing Starving for truth Closer where I started Chasing after you  I'm falling even more in love with you Letting go of all I've held onto I'm standing here until you make me move I'm hanging by a moment here with you  Forgetting all I'm lacking Completely and complete I'll take your invitation You take all of me  Now, I'm falling even more in love with you Letting go of all I've held onto I'm standing here until you make me move I'm hanging by a moment here with you  I'm living for the only thing I know I'm running and not quite sure where to go I don't know what I'm diving into Just hanging by a moment here with you  There's nothing left to lose Nothing left to fly There is nothing in the world that can change my mind There is nothing else There is nothing else  Desperate for changing Starving for truth Closer where I started Chasing after you  I'm falling even more in love with you Letting go of all I've held onto I'm standing here until you make me move I'm hanging by a moment here with you  I'm living for the only thing I know I'm running and not quite sure where to go I don't know what I'm diving into Just hanging by a moment here with you  Just hanging by a moment Hanging by a moment Hanging by a moment Hanging by a moment here with you
