Read ahead...a nice piece...  Parvati to Shiva "Pleasure leaves no memory. I mean: during the 25 years of our first embrace, when I had just left my fathers house, I often thought, as though making a long journey: I must remember what happened just now, exactly how this moment was, how we got there and how we left it behind. I was quite determined-and everything was quite clear and sharp, but the way dreams seem clear and sharp while we were dreaming them, we decide to remember them and fasten on every detail-and the idea that we might forget something seems so ridiculous we almost smile, because it is all too real, but then we wake up that thing evaporates along with all the rest. Try to understand: everything that happened is there inside me, just below the flux of my mind. But I cant recall the sequence of it all, I could remember far better the sequence of something unimportant to me: how I dressed one day, what makeup I put on, how I went down into the palace gardens, how I walked along a particular path and how I mounted my dappled horse, my two maids behind me, and how my maids were dressed, and the first words we spoke to each other.  Yet Kama, Desire is also called Smara, Memory. Indeed, its as if its his real name. Or at least that's the name I always use for him. And I saved his life, remember? For days I sat motionless before you, at a respectful distance, immersed in tapas. We didn't know each other then and I was just a girl. You kept your eyes closed all the time. When you opened them, you spoke, without even looking at me: "Whats happening?" you said, "Kama is here." Kama barely managed to get back to his feet-he was behind a bush - and to draw his bow with one of his five flowers, before your eye had shriveled him up. Then you looked at me, as though this was the first time you'd really seen me, and invited me to ask a boon of you. I said: "Now that Kama is dead, then there are no more boons to ask. Without Desire there can be no more emotion. Without emotion, men and women may as well ignore each other." So you granted me this boon, that Kama might go on living, but invisibly. When I was a little girl and used to invoke him, looking at the miniatures I'd painted of you, though I'd never seen you then, all I would say was "Smara, Smara..."   ~Excerpt from the book Ka, by Robert Calasso
