But I only had fruit for breakfast, I'm drinking water. Did chest presses and crunches today, and some back exercises. Not to mention walked and jogged a lil ways. Little steps will help me reach my goal. I'm going to get back into shape. I may never have the perfect body but I will not tolerate being obese anymore. I have several reasons for doing this.  1, To be healthier. My dad died from massive heart failure and the doc told him and me chances are it would happen to me too. 2, How many women could love someone that is a fat slob. I need to feel better about myself to attract someone I guess. If I'm more confidant, it will show.  3, I'm just tired of being fat. Tired of looking soft. I have a good base from when I lifted before. I'm broad with decent shoulders and chest and arms, just need to lose the middle.  I'm sure I could think of other reasons, but thats enough. I've talked with God about it. Asked for his help. I need self control. God is helping me with that.
