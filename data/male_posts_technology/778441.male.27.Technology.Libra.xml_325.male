Which means that it has been around for over 6 months now!! :-)  Let's get straight to the point. The biggest event this week was one of the saddest days in Mumbai's recent history. And it's not surprising that the shockwaves of the Mumbai Bomb Blasts were felt through the Blog world too. As a result, posts related to the blasts and the subsequent opinions merit a separate post altogether.  Yazad  will be hosting a round-up of the posts about the Mumbai bomb blasts, this weekend.  So, on with the Mela...  	  Yazad  notices a  political banner  that uses language one would not expect to see in serious political slogans. I wonder if anyone actually clicked a snap of that banner!  	  Shanti  posts about  an Associated Press news article  that curiously traces the root cause of the Mumbai blasts to the Hindu-Muslim riots in the 1940s, events that led to the partition of India. Clearly, the author of that AP article needs to read a chapter from an elementary school history book to understand that partition caused riots and not the other way round!  	  Niraj  cautions against the recent trend in some midwestern American cities, of accepting  illegal immigration  without the apparent consent of the US federal government.  	  Jivha  unearths a small newsitem that announces a BESCOM decision which is actually  an encroachment on our personal freedom .  	  JK  posts a detailed  book review  of "Fast Food Nation"... a book that he found " very gripping and interesting to listen ".  	 It's  JK  once more, as he is fascinated by a new archaelogical discovery that unravels some more facts about  Ancient India .  	  Smorgasbord  lists some of Mr. Christopher Hitchins' accusations against Mother Teresa in his post titled  Saints and Sinners ... accusations that try to " blazon her carefully crafted image of piety ".  	 Another post by  Jivha  finds a mention in the Mela. Here, he cautions against  revising history  as he wonders why, in the first place, did the Allahabad High Court ask the ASI to carry out excavations at the disputed site in Ayodhya.  	  Sandeep  has a detailed post about the de-merits of urbanization and its effects on the  Rural Indian Economy .  	  Radhika Nair  posts about an encounter with drunks that gets her thinking about how some  Britons feel insecure due to the immigrants .   	  Srijith  posts about the   Urdhva Tiryagbhyam   which is an extremely easy formula in Vedic Mathematics that simplifies all cases of multiplication. It really is amazing!!  	  Parag  has a  post  about earth's close encounter with Mars. He even has a photo on the post.    And that... is a round up of some of the interesting posts that have appeared on the Indian Blogscape in the past few days. I hope you enjoyed going through these wonderful posts.  My thanks to Shanti, JK, Ashwini, Yazad and Parag for sending in nominations for the Mela!! :-)
