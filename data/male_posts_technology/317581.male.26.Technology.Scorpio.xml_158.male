Damn, damn, I really want to watch the daily show from last night, but no one has it:( Soak Kelley, I didn't think you were really mad at me, I just wanted everyone who reads this to think you were:) (oops, now will you really be mad at me?)  Also, I am working this weekend, so if any girls who read this site that I don't know about were planning on showing up at my house sometime saturday or sunday afternoon dressed only in syran wrap, you'll have to wait until evening or do it next saturday. (is that a run on sentence?) hmm...
