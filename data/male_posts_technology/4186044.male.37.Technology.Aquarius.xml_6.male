My apartment complex got hammered. The first entrance is still blocked by an oak tree and there are branches of every type and size littering the entire complex.  The power went out Friday night at 9:30 pm but forunately was back on by Saturday night (in time for the Saturday Iron Chef showing).  Fortunately, none of my friends or family are any worse for the wear, even though there are still power issues throughout Central Florida.   My parents live in Longwood (a few miles from me) and I opted to spend the hurricane there (because, as you know, misery loves company). I wasn't very comfortable, so when the power came back on at 3:30 Saturday morning, I opted to drive home.  That was the scariest road trip ever. I live all of 3 miles away and it's the longest 3 miles I've ever driven. Trees in the roadway, signs all over the place, shredded canopies, you name it.  It sucked. Hopefully that will be the last Central Florida hurricane for another 40 years.  But don't count on it.
