I have a friend out here, I sometimes go to his house and play UT2k4. I live in the country now, so I don't really have neighbors.  I am finally going to receive half of the money my dad has owed me, I think I have enough to pre-order a DS and go to the comic store and get some posters. Hopefully I can get some pics of my room, because it is huge.  Some people want to start an anime club at the comic store, and I need to start a GO club here.  Nothing happens here, so there is nothing to write about.
