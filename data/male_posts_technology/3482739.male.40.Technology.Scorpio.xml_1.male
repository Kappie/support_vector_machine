My typical cover letter goes something like this;  In short, I have 16+ years of paid programming/IT experience in a variety of environments, with a diverse range of applications written including (but not limited to) Image Display ActiveX Control, Database front and back-end applications, Voice, Telephony and Communication software, and various DOS and Windows utilities.  I have over six years of [Visual] C++ and five that include use of MFC. I also have about 2.5 years of ATL and the same or more years of STL.  I have about 4.5 years of Visual Basic programming and 2-3 years of Borland Delphi experience.  I also have some experience in UML Use Case, Sequence and Collaboration diagrams and documentation as well as recent experience with MS SQL Server and Crystal Reports 8 and 9.  I have a long history with PC programming. I taught myself BASIC when DOS  was at version 1.1, and in 1987 I taught myself C. I later got a certificate in C/C++ programming. I have taught myself C# and am actually working on a VSS-like Source Code Control application thats been written in 100% C#.  There is not an environment or language that I have not become quickly proficient and productive in and there is not a job so small that it does not get my 110% dedication.  I would love a chance to talk with you about your company's needs, and where my skill set might fit into those needs.  *** end.  The URL to my resume is: http://mysite.verizon.net/mrbeavis/skfsopht.html Which of course contains a link to the Word version.. which I actually need to update.... ok, thats done.  SO, if that looks interesting to anyone, by all means, shoot me an e-mail and lets talk!   Thanks for watching.  ;D
