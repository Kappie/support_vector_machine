They are : Unit 1 = 27 (merit) Unit 2 = 29 (distinction) Unit 3 = 25 (merit) I am pretty  happy with that but that unit 1 was a bit annoying because i was 1 mark away from getting a distintion !  Overall i think i will get a B maybe if i try harder i can geet an A ! Yippee. Neway thats all i wanted to say LOL Toodles-  Jackie
