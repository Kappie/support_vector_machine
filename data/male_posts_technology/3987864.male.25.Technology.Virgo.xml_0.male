A wonderful woman whom I've loved every day, every minute, every seconds of my life up to today, up to now. Have been experiencing the joy of working out my biceps, triceps  abs. Feel stronger everyday, feel energetic everyday. Life seems to pass by with meanings now at least than the times it used to be in the past...  To the woman I've loved for 5 years 1 month  5 days..... "Honey, I love you, and I always will"
