But we do. we also know that there is land around. And at times we swim out of river ,call it time out, and sit on the land and see the river flow. Try to understand where the river is flowing why the river is flowing.  Aftersometime you dive back and at times try to swim against the flow. At times with the flow. But the important thing to realize is that the log can float. WE have to swim.  There are not rules in life. As bhai says we have been tagged all our life. Our happiness is tagged with the fulfilment of desires. I think it takes almost a life time to realize that happiness and desires are not connected and at times even more.
