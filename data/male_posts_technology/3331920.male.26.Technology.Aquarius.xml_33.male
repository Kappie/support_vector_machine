American Idol and it's Canadian cousin represent the lowest pandering form of entertainment to me.  Granted there are some talented people on these shows.  But do they really need to strut themselves in front of washed up celebrities, and ignorant 'judges'.  The answer is no.  These shows are one giant mind-f#?k with corporate sponsors.  There, rant done.  On a completely unrelated note, i've been playing the latest EA Potter game, Prisoner of Azkaban.  These games never really offer a whole lot, except to fans of the books.  They're usually good fun though.  This one is no exception, i'm just rolling on it tonight.  Thank you cards are marching along, most are thought up, now i just have to 'neatly' write them and mail them off by the end of the week.  Still on target.  I'm out.
