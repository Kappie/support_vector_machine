I found out that Greendale, the Neil Young movie, will be playing there soon. I put it in my calendar to go see it on the 24th since I'll be in Seattle during the other showings. I'll have to get the guys to reschedule practice that day. Anyway, going to the movies at Broadway is fun and I need to do it more often since there are some interesting shows coming up.   I finished cleaning the main floor today and stuff. Ummm, I'm forgetting what else I was gonna say.   NOW PLAYING: Greendale - Neil Young  Crazy Horse
