My son is growing faster than a weed, and is already taller than me, yet, school work and chores might as well be located on Mars.  Take last week, for example.  He and his friend decide to re-decorate his room, by placing post-it notes all over everything... The walls, furniture, light fixtures... everywhere.  That episode was followed up with a carving of the letter A on the back of his hand with his pocket knife.  Then, yesterday, I pick him up from school, where he tells me that he and his girlfriend have broken up.  Here's an exert...  "What happened?" "We broke up." "Why" "I don't know." "How did it happen?" "I don't want to talk about it."  End of conversation.  Then, 30 minutes after we get home, he's on the phone with her.  When he hangs up, he throws his arms up in frustration.  I ask who was that, and he replies, "Katie."   "Are you guys still broke up?" "No... she is so complicated!" "And you...?" "Black and White, Dad."  ????
