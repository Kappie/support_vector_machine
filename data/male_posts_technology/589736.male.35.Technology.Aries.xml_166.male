They also like to hide the oil filter in a place where there no grip. It is amazing how tight the filter gets. I was pounding on it to loosen it to no avail. Finally my I asked my brother for a large grip wrench. He had none. Though he came up with the next best thing. A monkey wrench. At first I did not think this would work do the tight space, but sure enough my older brother's tenacity prevailed and he saved the day and got the oil filter off. Now one might ask why I not just take it to a Jiffy Lube. Well, they screwed me the last time and I feel better about doing it myself. So the lesson I learned to day is to have the correct tools for my car to change the oil. And now I think I will go clean up. Thanks for "listening".
