Tragically, she's infected and/or killed her mother, her father, her pastor, her grandmother, and her brother... And yet, she has survived and is recovering.  Scientists are calling her a "super-spreader". (Which, coincidentally, is what Madonna was called in the 1980's...)  Seriously though, how would you like to be this girl who,  through absolutely no fault of her own , killed so many people or made them seriously ill and yet she  survived. If you're going to cause a nation so much grief and panic, it's almost better to end up dead afterward than to have survived it, don't you think?  I'd like to see this girl interviewed in a couple of years time to hear about how she was able to cope.  Scott
