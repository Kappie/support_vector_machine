Its true that if you have passion for something, you will definitely find time for it. Kudos...carry on.   The discussion is too good that i find myself in a limbo between Bala's view and the rest. Thogh there is not much i could say as everything have been said...  Had it not been for the technology i woudnt even have dreamt about coming to UK let alone living...the only link between me and my loved ones is the blessed phone and the gifted internet. Regarding the working hours, people in western countries goive utmost priority to their personal life, they make it a point not to work during weekends and after 5 pm in the weekdays. But in most cases its the other way round in India. Even if you dont want to you are forced to work longer hours, which means compromising personal life. Problem lies in our work culture.  We may be living in a mechanical world but it doesnt mean that our love for our dear ones is going into the drains. Grinding chutney with stones and washing clothes with my hands will definitely give me pleasure but will my fast paced environment let me have time for these things. The answer will probably be a big ' No '. We perfectly understand that this is not the only way to show your love for someone.  People had been expressing their love before centuries back, when the word ' technology ' sounded alien, and will continue to do so, but with a touch of modernisation as long as they have a genuine love.
