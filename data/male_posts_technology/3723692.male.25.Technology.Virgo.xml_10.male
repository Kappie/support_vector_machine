During the whole waiting process, quite a few opportunities of lesser or no preference pass by and we let them pass. We do not even give a second thought of riding on those opportunities. And so it happens most of the time when our preferred opportunity doesn’t arrive, we are forced to take the non preferred one. But the difference is we end up losing considerable amount of time. The time in which we could have achieved a lot and won a lot. We could have been lot ahead of what we ever imagined to be. So my advice to you is, don’t always end up waiting for chances of your own liking, if u ever get a secondary or tertiary choice always give second thought to it. Check all the parameters and if its worth it go for it, you never know where you end up.    Adios  PS: I could have written it quite well, just am in ------g mood right now so this is all I could do. But I believe you guys are intelligent enough to interpret it on your own.
