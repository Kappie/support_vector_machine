So I guess I qualify for two out of three (and I am NOT attracted to members of the same sex.)  But we are all a little gay.  Some people are just UBER-gay, like Licky Poo-Poo and your bruther Craaig.  But holla' at the beer-funneling through the anus.  I never thought it could be done, but you guys proved me wrong.  I just downloaded the video.  The quality is surprisingly good.    Some people say that when it comes to Blogging, you've either got something to say or you don't.  But if you've got something to say, why the fuck don't you just say it instead of writing it down on some gay-ass blog?  Fuck those people.  Autumn-Leezy Blog forever!!!  We're here and we're queer, and if you can't get used to it...you can go blog yourself, bitch.
