I could use a mechanical pal to chat with, and help clean, and kill intruders.  Not that I ever get any intruders, but if I had a robot, I'd advertise.  (Sign on the front door - "Free Money Inside.  Don't Knock - Just Barge Right In.")  I'd have to make a few home modifications.  Asimov's laws would be simplified as follows:   Grant is not a target.  Unless he's feeling suicidal or needs to be euthanized.  Everybody else can take their chances.   Then of course, I'd have to upgrade the hardware - chainsaws, flame-throwers, machine guns, keg tap, MP3 player, rocket launcher, feather duster, and maybe a built-in doomsday device.  Talk about your killer aps, hee hee hee.  Anyway, when I get the robot, party at my place!  Everyone's invited.  Don't knock - just barge right in.  Call ahead so I'll know to take cover.  Carnage, out
