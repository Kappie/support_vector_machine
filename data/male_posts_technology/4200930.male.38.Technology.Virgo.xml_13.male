Got to bed even later by the time I had finished reading.  Also late last night I was trying the chase-up the contractor for our back garden. It’s so wet lately, ducks could happily live there! Possibly the ideal area for a pond – come to think of it I just need to add more water! Drown, you slimy slugs, drown!!!!!  An easy and most importantly quiet day to day is needed to help, ease me into the day. Will start the day by researching web site counters - why, because I can.  Fingers crossed for the Core Control Radio station draw for a holiday. Wish me luck!
