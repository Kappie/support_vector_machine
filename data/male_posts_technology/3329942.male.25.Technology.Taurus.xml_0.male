This is the liner written on the 1 of the 4 T-Shirts I bought on saturday shopping Spree at Westside (for those who donno Westside - Its a brandname owned by TATA and now a days have sell almost everything made of fabric ;-) )  So what were the other 3 T-Shirts have ;-)    1. I only drink to be Anti-Social 2. Don't Keep the faith, Spread it around. 3. Always be Sincere, whether you serious or not.   I wonder from where this ppl get the liners for T-shirt.  A weekend before, me and vikas were roaming around and had a look at those   FCUK - The french Connection   branded ones at GK ...They were fundoo..LOUD to the extreames... ;-)  Our unamiously favorite one had     Virgins' - Search and Rescue Team    well the weekend was blasted away with 3 movies.  1. Yuva - (Hindi - Young) - Fundoo movie, nothing less was expected out of Maniratnam. 2. Hum Tum - (Hindi - We and You) - Harry meets Sally types; had a good laugh. 3. Along came Polly - Awesome, Never go on scuba diving on yr honeymoon ;-)  there are again a lot coming up and several are still pending  1. Van Helsing 2. The Day after tommorow. 3.
