After browsing through  the Blogger API, the first thought that struck my mind was to create a small tool and there i go, getting the XMLRPC implementation for Delphi and halfway through my search i bump across blogBuddy!   The project seems to be long dead, but what the heck, blogBuddy works! check it out!    its cool! urlLink
