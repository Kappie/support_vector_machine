Viju (the only girl[?] in the trek) celebrated her 22nd birthday on Friday, the first day of the trek. We had plans to celebrate it there but we somehow missed to get the cake as we had planned. But we made it up that week during photo sharing session.  Well...sorry Viju..SCJP...I forgot to mention about your b'day.  :-)
