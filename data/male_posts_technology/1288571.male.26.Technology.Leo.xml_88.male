I turned it on once home and turns out that theres 2 wireless networks close by that aren't protected by a WEP key and are broadcasting their SSID. I'm actually connected to it right now. His SSID was still "Linksys" so I thought "Hey, I bet he hasn't even changed his router login/pass from the defaults either!"  Guess what? No he hasn't.  The unfortunate thing is that he probably doesn't even know that he has a security leak. If I was malicious, I could really wreck his crap. Lucky for him, I'm not. I intend to drop a word doc on one of his lan shares that informs him what he needs to do to protect his network...  .....but not until Sunday evening. ;)
