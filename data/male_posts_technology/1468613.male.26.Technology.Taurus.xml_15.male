But 'WHY?', I hear you ask! Well, I'm sitting in exactly the same spot that I was this time last week with the same perplexed expression on my face trying to figure  urlLink this shit  out and this time you're not going to walk in the door and save me. ARGH!  In other news Kaia and I made  urlLink Jamie Oliver 's yummo Custard Tarts last night and we both have colds so poor James is not only surrounded by estrogen but snotty tissues as well. Heh, bet you don't miss us so much now!  Hope Glasgow is treating you well sweetheart.   Till next time, Caz xxx
