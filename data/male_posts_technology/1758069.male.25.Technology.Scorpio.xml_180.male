(diet coke?  ever suck dick for 25 cents and a piece of cardboard nigga?!?).  what am i saying, crackies don't read.    album du jour:   urlLink   stretch princess        fun with humans   check out their home page and look at the guy on the left (i think his name is james wright).  he has this oh-shit-man-i-just-trashed-my-dad's-beamer-on-prom-night-and-i-forgot-my-name look.  i found it tres drole.
