Loads of big corporations like HSBC and other ones that lent money to Saddam's regime and sold him weapons worth millions, now he's gone they're demanding their money back. Iraq's debt is something like £30 billion and is going up all the time due to interest. HSBC are demaning something like £200 million back from Iraq, which puts like a £12,000 debt on the head of every Iraqi- money they simply don't have and can't get. I thought that was really rude an absolutely ridiculous, but this program was really eye-opening.  Anyway, enough of that, but I am finding politics really interesting now I actually understand about it! Shut up Jo. Go do something useful.
