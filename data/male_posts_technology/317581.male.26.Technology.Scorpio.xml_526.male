So far the main subjects have been, grocery cards, God and natives vs. transplants.  urlLink rants  raves in seattle / tacoma   It's just funny to me, how much of my day that I spend at craigslist, and how sad it is that everyone gets so worked up over these things.   urlLink Best of craigslist  is pretty good!
