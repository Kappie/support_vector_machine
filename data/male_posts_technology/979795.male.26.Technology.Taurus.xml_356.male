She said she's new as well but she seems to handle the kids very well. I sat in for one of her webpage building classes. One thing that struck me was that the students may be cheeky at times but they were obedient. It's either the school has disciplined them really well or it's because they're just girls... I dunno. I was quite blur when I saw some of them already blogging at such a young age (think that class was Pri 6). Goodness ... kids these days. There were some really talkative ones too. But in this school a lot of the students were happy to pounce on the chance to show what they were capable of. Daphne actually picked some of the students to present to the class and they were really hyper about it. After that the last 15min was basically a mini concert where some students decided to sing for the rest of the class. I have to admit I was seriously entertained on my first day there. Can't stop laughing. They even did a dance. It just makes me wonder whether they do these kinda stuff in their spare time (choreographing that is), and somemore all these were all impromtu rather than pre-arranged. OK, it still feels ultra weird to be called Mr Tan and I don't really remember to greet them back when they greet me "Good morning" or something. If it was just passing by the corridor it would've been easier. Today was a bit more boring. First of all I had problem getting access into the labs and had to wait for Daphne to arrive. The whole day was spent testing if their old educational CD-ROMs could run on their newly migrated systems with WinXP installed. Did finish most of it though but still left with some. Should be able to complete on Mon.  Which brings another problem. There's absolutely no way I can leave school and arrive on time at Tanglin CC on Mon evening for the combined training, being a new job and all. If the award ceremony is at the start (which I would assume it to be), I think I'll miss it.  I've gotten confirmation from SPF saying they are not recruiting anymore SO at this time. Well, I'm still disappointed but I think it's for the best now. I can concentrate on working for the next few months and learn something here. The school seems like a really nice place to work in and the Principal, my HOD (Tracey), Daphne and TA (technician) all seem and sound like nice people to be around. There's one thing I do wish for though ... more male toilets in the school. Hahah :P
