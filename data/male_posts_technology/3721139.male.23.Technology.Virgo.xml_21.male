I had a little mid-morning workout, a four hour you're-so-rusty-but-damn-that-felt-good climbing bonanza, I got the sandwich that Coffee Station owed me, I learned Jennie's name from Rebecca and Rebecca's name from Jennie in a smooth not-mad-at-for-forgetting sort of way (they're twins, they work at different places, connect the dots), and then I went and saw Will Farrel's Anchorman.  The movie was funny, I'll give it that.  But I could have done without the George W. Bush cheapshot at the end.  What is this crap? Is July the month of Bush Administration black-eyes-on-the-big-screen?  I almost afraid of watching "I, Robot" for fear of YABB (yet another Bush bashing).  And I wasn't alone, I heard half a dozen people grumbling about it as the credits rolled.  I even had one girl whining at me about it!  Hollywood, fuck off.
