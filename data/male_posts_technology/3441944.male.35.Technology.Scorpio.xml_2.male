Over the past few years there has been a lot of hype and paranoia in the US around the practise of moving "American" (hah) jobs to countries that have lower cost profiles than the US - primiarily in terms of the cost per hour of labour.   This got me thinking...why should I be stuck here in a dreary Anytown, USA office working my butt off for (an admittedly good) salary when I could be working my butt off for (a lower but equivalent in terms of cost of living) salary in an exotic location...like Cancun, Mexico for example.  Well it took a little while to plan. But now I'm here. It's only been a month but no regrets yet. My productivity has soared, I'm full of enthusiasm and energy for my work again.
