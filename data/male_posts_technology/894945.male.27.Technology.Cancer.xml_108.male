I pray for a cloud of cat-shit to rain down those idiots. I have watched about ten minutes in total of this series, and seven minutes of that consisted of a fat bloke reading a copy of Vogue.   That blonde one, Jade I think her name is.. she's about as bright as a set of fairy lights from Woolies.   The only possible way they could claw it back, is if you could call in and administer electric shock therapy by telephone to the housemates. Or they released a set of rabid, starving, pit bulls into the house, on the hour, for the next week. Years of technological advancement in television should not culminate in a blonde airhead insisting that Sherlock Holmes is a real person.
