My son is blogging now (at my suggestion) and he posted the following  urlLink Religion to Me  The very idea that poof and we all began to exist is difficult for me to believe. I believe we are the result of a big bang. I believe we are the result of evolution. But I also believe in the Biblical creation as well. The Bible doesn't go into great detail about how everything was created. It is a pretty loose story as far as details go. And it says God created it all in seven days. How can we expect a higher power who has been around from forever to infinity to have a concept of time. For him to keep up with time would mean it would probably drag on. We do not have the full mental capacity to understand God. In fact often when I try to imagine how it all came to be and try to put some understanding to it my head hurts. The Greeks believed when we die we gain all the knowledge there is to know. When we are born again we lose that knowledge and spend our lives trying to gain it all back. In death we repeat the cycle. I wonder at times if the Greeks were on to something; if our brains contain all the knowledge there is to know but we are simply waiting for the different pieces of information that allow us to unlock that.  I am a logical person. It doesn't mean I am a smart person it just means I claim to have some rhyme or reason to my thought processes. I have to think things out to the Nth degree before I make up my mind. To me there is absolutely no way there isn't a God. I believe sort of like the Deist that God created it all based on rules he determined. These became our scientific laws. Because God made up the boundaries as science progresses forward we will discover these boundaries and because they are consistent through out creation and the universe we can depend on these "laws" to work. Math is a science. What if God is a mathematician? God could have created it all anyway he wanted. So what if he used the Big Bang to create the Universe and then he used evolution to create all animals upon the earth?  Every religion has their own creation story. In many of then there are similarities. Because of this I have theorized that several religions worship the same God in a lot of cases and our religion is shaped by the survival skills and culture that come about from countries forming. The original Bible stories are put together by prophets to teach as well to keep their followers in line. Often these were written from myths that had been passed on by word of mouth before the written word. I believe all of these words were influenced by God. I believe in Heaven and Hell. Nearly every religion has some punishment and reward system. I believe if we live a good life and do good unto others we will go to Heaven. If we do evil and wrong we will go to Hell. And I believe going to church or synagogue re-enforces our beliefs and helps us to continue to do well. Being close to God is a good feeling. We may be God's soap opera, but so what. And with freewill it is up to us to seek him out and not God to see us out.  This is what I believe. I am sure others believe something different.
