By the time we got home though my stomach was a mess...I felt so bad.  The good news is that when I woke up Saturday it felt much better.  Ann had gone to Indy with Elizabeth Friday and they came back with a legit car load of food.  They had a bunch of people over for a get together and it was nice.  Later we went to a Xavier gathering and then to Dana's...all in all it was good.  Sunday my parents came up and brought me this cool new monitor.  It is really nice.  I no longer have to squint.  We also went to see my grandma and then went to LaRossa's for dinner.  I love hanging out with my family.  Everything is just so much funnier when they are around.  Well I am off to Mass for tonight...until then...
