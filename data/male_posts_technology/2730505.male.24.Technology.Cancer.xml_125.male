I don't know if it's such a good idea to join a lot but whatever, we'll give it a shot   urlLink Chicago_Cheap   urlLink Chicago_Club    urlLink Chicago_Party   urlLink ChicagoCubs   urlLink DailyQuotes   urlLink LiteraryQuotes   urlLink LovingGeekLadies   urlLink WeLoveGeeks   I personally like the Cubs community, there's always something happening there.  i do wonder though if the place dies down during the off season.  I have a strange feeling that they don't.  I don't know what to expect from Chicago_Party, there might be a few happenings where a bar might be mentioned as a cool place to hang out or something  I'm more currious about the LovingGeekLadies and WeLoveGeeks communities.  It seems that there are really GEEK girls out there.  I thought that the last girlfriend was an apparition but it looks like they're quite a few of them.  Hopefull there are some in the Chicagoland area.  God forbid I find something out of the fucking state again.  YAY!!!  Looks as if I can keep myself busy for quite a while, hehe.
