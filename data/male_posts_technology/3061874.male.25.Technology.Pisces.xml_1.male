Or will it master both independently?  Google is slowly moving away from a pure search engine company to a services company where its getting more closer to user needs. The most common things that a user does on the internet are Email and Search. Google has got it both.   With an IPO coming forward, it must have huge plans for going forward.   Google does search on around 4.2 billion webpages which might be a fraction of the internet space. Google has very tactfully managed to work on that amount of data. The desktop data space might be quite huge as compared to the internet but can google master to have a small percentage of this space? A user is then no longer worried about losing his data ever. And google manages it efficiently and enables him to find it efficiently whenever he needs it.  Or will the google tools come closer to the desktop? And therefore one will have a number of tools for each of the multiple devices, a user uses. Or in a true ambient intelligence scenario, google can combine data from multiple data sources for an individual and enable it in the way a user wants, no matter wherever he is, which ever device he is using!
