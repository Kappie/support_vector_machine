It may be nothing they do or say, it is just a feeling that pops up when least expected.  I went through the drive-thru at Arctic Circle.  (a low-class fast food joint with ice cream, I wish there was a Dairy Queen in town)  There is one guy at the drive through who has always creeped me out, and he is always there waiting for me, telling me in his smarmy, lewd, perverted voice, "here's your chicken salad, out of a big TEN dollars, your change is 3.53!".  But today as we exchanged food and money, our hands briefly touched in that strangely uncomfortable way, and a subconscious drive-thru speaker sounded in my head, screaming "HE MASTURBATES WITH THAT HAND", then "CHILD MOLESTER".  I was so stunned almost drove off without my food, thankful when the other worker handded it to me.  I cannot describe the disgust and revulsion that came over me in that moment.  He did nothing out of the ordinary, and is probably guilty of nothing other than nerdiness, but I will never get that out of my brain. The salad tasted poisoned, as I thought about it all of lunch.  Did you ever read Stephen King's Dead Zone, where the character gets a psychic flash of people when they touch?  Very creepy.  The other thing that creeps me out is the thought of the skanky ho's that apparently find desparate customers down on 2nd street.    More about this later.
