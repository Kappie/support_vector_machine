His defense is not exactly clarifying ("My Father is working until now, and I myself am working", 5:17).  Specifically, I've wondered whether telling a man to carry his mat around (John 5), or having his disciples pick grain on the Sabbath is legit.  Not sure.    But either way, Jesus gives us a good example of Christian liberty in action, as well as the true meaning of the Sabbath. In chapter five, we find a man who has been lying on the ground, outside of the city for 38 years. He wants to get into the Sheep Pool in order to be healed, but cannot since he is lame. Jesus heals him without the use of the water, and commands him to take up his mat and go free.    The man stands symbolically for the generation of the Jews who continue to wander in the wilderness like the generation of the Exodus. The 38 years remind us of the wilderness wanderings, as well as his position outside of the city. Jesus brings Sabbath to this man by doing what water (standing for the Old Covenant in John) cannot do- give him rest and celebration by bringing him into the City. Jesus is showing us that the Sabbath is fulfilled by being able to enter the city and join the celebration, which He gives to us.    And if Jesus does do it contrary to Old Testament commands, then he uses his freedom from the Law to bless others and give grace. We are not free to ignore the Sabbath to treat it like every other day, but we are free to give grace and rest to others and thus fulfill it.
