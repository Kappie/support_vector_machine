    
       This is my first blog ever.  As I see it, this is a new year, new city (Bangalore, India), new job and great new opportunity to start learning all over again. This represents shift in my world as i start to move away from programming towards interacting with people. More value there defintely, as I firmly believe in the power of like minded people contributing to the same cause.  The start from being an island to being the channel that feeds to the river of knowledge. You'll see more of me now.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.
