I came out as a liberal when I was about thirteen, and my grandfather told me he would rather shoot me in the head right then, than see me become a "communist" (and he wasn't kidding). Kind of reminiscent of the McCarthy era, don't you think? I saw us go to war in Viet Nam and trample the constitution. I saw the civil rights of a whole race of people being challenged because that's the way it's always been. I heard conservatives say it was neccesary to kill students at Kent State University who were exercising their constitutional rights. Well when you are faced with that kind of conservatism, you either fall in line or start questioning what is right. I did the latter. I'm a Dem because I believe firmly in the power of the people to govern themselves through the democratic process. I believe in the power of the human spirit, to become better than what we used to be, to grow, to be alive. If the founding fathers wanted the constitution to be a museum piece with no room for improvement, they wouldn't have made a way for us to amend it,... there would only be one party, the conservative Republicans. Things would be the same as they were over two hundred years ago. We'd still be burning witches, stoning homosexuals, and most of the women in this country would be wearing a large "A" emblasoned on their breast in crimson. For me liberalism is a flame... the flame of freedom that burns in the hand of a woman called Liberty. A flame that calls all people equal. She does not stand in the harbour to protect us from the infidel...but to welcome all those who are oppressed. We must ever go forward,...not back.
