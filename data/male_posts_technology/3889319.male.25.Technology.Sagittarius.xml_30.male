Her tone is different, she seems to choose different words than before. I'm very pessimistic about this. She chose not to replay to my messages last night, and the reason for this was, and i quote: "I went to sleep early last night and didn't have the time today to replay". I called her couple of minutes ago and she was with her family on their way to Canada Center, and i told her that i want to talk, and that i have some questions to ask. She had a cold attitude, nothing i'm used to in her, she said she'll call me back after she gets home, and she wasn't sure that everything is ok! She has something  BAD  to tell.  I'm not a natural suspicious person, but i'm a natural fortune-teller. If i have a feeling for something then i know it for sure. For my sake and for this relationship sake i hope i'm  WRONG .  I cant concentrate on anything right now! I was studying JAVA and was doing well so far, until that phone call.   What drives me crazy is that i'm 100% sure we are going to break up, but what i don't understand is why? I've done nothing wrong, neither did she! Everything seemed to be perfect.. Reality, reliability, trust, mutual respect,.. What the hell happened? Did i miss something?  Funny thing.. I noticed now that this post i all written in the  Past Simple  syntax.   Ohhh God,...
