Turns out my car radiator decided to go bad and was spewing engine coolant all over the place.  So pretty much I had to just keep refilling my car with coolant if I wanted to drive anywhere. *fun fun*  At least my presentation on Cuba went well at class despite lingering headaches all day.  So yesterday 2 of my friends helped me out and drove me to the auto parts store and we got a replacement radiator and they put it in. All I gotta say is I owe those guys big time!.  The f'ing dealership wanted $600 to replace the thing and they were able to do it for $145 (cost of the radiator itself).  I must say knowing people who are car junkies really comes in handy.
