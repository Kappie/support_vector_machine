According to them sinus alergies and infections. Seems the sinus's lie above your upper teeth  and can effect them. Well, it effected this one. Not going into too much detail. Seems that rather than them working on the one, they had to also work on the two beside it, 3 in all. Mind you she is 6. The Dr. said she had strong good teeth, but this one got problems. At first he didnt think it was even abcess (the first dentist referred her to this one stating abcess tooth). He was going to just shrug it off since it did not appear abcess nor tender, ect. Then he decided to go ahead and drill in, that's when he noticed no blood. Evidently this is not a good sign. The news became worse, from a simple dentist exam to a referral, now we are told the tooth was so badly absessed they contemplated on outpatient surgery on it for Friday, fearing they may not have been able to save it. Seems the infection was so bad, the possibilty of an absess to the brain was high. My wife was freaking. She was giving me phone call after phone call as the information poured in during everyin 5 minute interval. On top of this, the visit costed 385 bucks, our payment. Total was 850 bucks but insurance would pay most. They were on the phone with our insurance getting an amount. Man, you talk about sucking. Not only was they in there for 2 hours after one hour waiting, now were told cough up the 385, given we could write a post check.    After all this, comes the silver lining from this storm. 1) The fact that my daughter was under a severe infection we were not even aware of. This caught it while we were home, rather than on our vacation trip next week. 2) Somehow, ( Gotta be God because my wife was actually praying during this with one of the dentist attendant) without my wife asking the Dentist decided to give us a discount, cutting off some of the cost. The 385 went down to 250 due. My wifes dad said he had it and would give it to us, he was at my house during all this, coming over from work and wrote out a check for my wife to deposit it covering our expenses. And get this, this assistant placed it in the computer to always give us this same discount, for all future visits.  So yes, there was indeed a silver lining yesterday and man, was I glad of it. And yes, I did think my God.
