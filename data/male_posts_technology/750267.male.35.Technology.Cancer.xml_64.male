The article said "the prospect of a tech giant like Apple or Microsoft delving into the music business is an affirmation that it is possible to make digital downloading profitable".  Is Apple a "tech giant"? I mean, no offense to all those that love the company's products, but can they be compared side by side with Microsoft? I kind of view Apple as a David, next to the big Microsoft Goliath. I'm sure alot of Apple fans do too. When I think tech giant, companies such as AOL, Sony, Philips, LG, etc..come to mind.   AAPL Sales: $5,742 Mil  Income: $65 Mil  Market Cap: $4,895 Mil    MSFT Sales: $28,365 Mil (+393% more than Apple) Income: $7,829 Mil (+11,944% more than Apple) Market Cap: $264,859 Mil (+5,310% more than Apple)       SNE (Sony) Sales: $57,117 Mil (+894% more than Apple) Income: $70 Mil (+7% more than Apple) Market Cap: $29,820 Mil (+509% more than Apple)  It appears that, on the basis of market cap, Microsoft is 54 times the size of Apple. Sony is 6 times the size. Microsoft being almost a pure software play is almost all profit. Apple, being mostly a hardware play, has very thin margins by comparison. Sure there are other ways to compare the two. But it would all work out the same in the end. Microsoft could purchase all of Apple at current market prices just with one year's profits, and have enough left over to buy every single American man, woman and child dinner at McDonalds including dessert.
