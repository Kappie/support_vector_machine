Ian's birthday was on the 7th and he has been dying to go to a water park for weeks now (I haven't and you only get one guess as to why). Ian also thought that we could use a nice little vacation. We had heard about The Pointe at South Mountain Resort on the Travel channel and from family. It was awesome. We only stayed one night, but it was enough. We went early on the 6th, parked our stuff in the room and hit the Oasis, which is the water park at the resort. It has two big speed slides and one curvey one. There is a lazy river, a wave pool with a section around the corner for water volleyball and basketball, and then there is a little 1.5ft deep pool for the little kids with one of those fountains right next to it. I spent a lot of time with the kids at the little pool the second day giving Ian a chance to go down the big slides, I think he did those about ten times each. The boys are a nice golden brown now, you should see the tan lines! We had lunch the first day and breakfast the second day at The Phantom Horse Grill it was very good. The best was dinner at Aunt Chilada's (pun intended)! There is a little pathway through a huge lawn from the hotel to the restaurant and then there is a little bridge over a canal with a sign that says "The little Rio Grande". Very cute and good food. We had a wonderful time and Ian had a really great birthday. Oh, yeah, there were fountains all over the grounds, ranging in size from monstrously huge to little, so Hunter was in heaven.
