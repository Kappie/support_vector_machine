I was then joking and playing around with people on the table, and promptly lost some more, won alot more, and lost the rest. Oh well. It was only 10/1 NL.   The good thing about tonight is I capped $400 so I am in the green again. It feels good. I had two nice $25NL sessions and a $5/1 NL 1st Place win to do it. I also made $10 at a .50/1 table. I really want to get to $600 and start playing some $1/2. I am making sure I stay within my limits. I think that 300xBB is a good metric and I am not going to play higher tables until I have the money.  The Patriots are kicking the Eagles butts! Ya Baby! It is going to be a good year me thinks.
