 Mother nature is the culprit. That and the trail is not cut correctly in some places so erosion has become a huge problem. This trail scared the bejeezes out of me the first time I rode it. You might recall some other posts I've written about it. The downhills were scary to me then because they were so sandy with tons of roots, so it was hard for me to trust the bike and just let it go. Now, water has eroded the downhill sections so that there are repetitive drops as high as a foot and a half in some sections.
 
 One downhillsection got me pretty good last night. The section in question starts at a relatively steep downward angle and then turns 45 degrees to the right. Immediately after turning there are three drops in a row, averaging about a foot in height. I hit the first two drops okay, but I came off at a weird angle on the third. I hit the ground leaning back and slightly to the left, which immediatelyput me off balance, causing me to fall off the bike to my right. Thanks to the excellent grooming on this particular section, I landed on a particularly hard packed patch of dirt, covered with gravel. Needless to say, my shin, hip, and forearm are a little worse off than they were yesterday at this time.
 
 The bike held up okay. The handlebars only looked like a twisted mess when all was said and done. I untangled the wires from the post and made sure everything was in working order. It took a good few tugs to get the rear break working again (which is essential for this type of trail), but I eventually got everything (including my legs) back into riding shape. You can imagine that I was a little more hessitant on the rest of the downhill sections following this spill.
 
 The only problem I've had with my bike is my toe clip keeps breaking. The toe clip is just a strap that keeps your foot on the pedal. I smashed the reflector that was holding it in place, so now I can pop it out of the bolts that "hold it down" at will practically. I'm thinking about getting clipless pedals now. Don't ask me why they're called clipless, because they're the type that you "clip" in with special shoes and everything. I'm a little hessitant to buy them for two reasons. First, it's going to cost me about $100 for the pedals and the shoes. Second, I'm not so confident about my riding skills that I can trust myself to not wreck all the time. You can imagine what it's like to wreck when you are literally attached to the bike...I don't think it would be much fun.
 
 It's time for another long ride at Rocky Point. I think RP is approximately 21 miles long if you do the whole thing. Last time I did this, my legs almost snapped in half from cramping. I hope to avoid such a fate this time. Until next time, cheers!
