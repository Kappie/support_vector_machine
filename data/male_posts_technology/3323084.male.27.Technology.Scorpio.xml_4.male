I've had my Lycos account for over five years and have been reluctant to totally do away with it because some old freinds from college may still have it.  Anyway, a few months ago the Lycos home page changed, for the worst.  It looks unprofessional, the organization is bad, and now theres an Adult Ad right there on the home page, usually labeled  Adults 18+.   If that weren't enough, popup windows now bomb bard me as soon as the page comes up.  And forget about checking e-mail, I know that the free mail has ads but I think they may have sold my address to the porn industry.  Since the change, every time I click on something while trying to see any legit e-mail multiple popup windows come up, some are even blank.  My friend Chris told me to just get an account with hotmail or yahoo and e-mail everyone the new address I get and be done with it, but it's not that easy, I've lost some addresses, or others are no longer valid anymore.  You can tell that I keep up with my old friends can't you.  I don't know what happened to Lycos but it's not good.  I have recently moved all of my stuff away from Lycos to Hotmail were I'm much happier.  Until next time...
