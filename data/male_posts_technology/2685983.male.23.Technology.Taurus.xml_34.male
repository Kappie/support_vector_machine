Now that that mundane news is out of the way I'm very excited that my girlfriend, Jenn, is driving all the way here from Seattle to visit me today. I went to work half an hour early so I could be out sooner. There was no one here when I got to work so I had to wait around for the door to be unlocked. I have no idea what time Jenn is gonna be here anyway. An unfortunate thing is that the band does have to practice this weekend. I wasn't sure when to schedule it best so right now it's 6:30 today. I hope that works out good for when Jenn gets here somehow.  I have no idea what me and Jenn will do. It's pretty wet and gray and cold out. But we're gonna drink martinis and watch movies. We kept the weekend pretty much open.  Okay I'm sick of writing. Later.
