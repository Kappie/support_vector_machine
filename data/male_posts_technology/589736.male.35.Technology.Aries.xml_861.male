(And yes, JLS, the damn things actually are trucks anyway.) BTW, my cousin drives one - but she bought it after she'd had not one but TWO cars totalled around her in collisions caused by SUVs, after one of which her car had to be sawed in half so that she could be extracted safely. Isn't something wrong here? Why do we have to fight evil polluters with their own oversized weapons?  And hey, aren't you mystified about MBFGW turning into a series? I mean, it's cool that they're all working, given today's economy, but isn't that stretching the idea a little thinly? The commercials make it look idiotic. It's a sitcom, I guess, but really. --And you know, I didn't see the movie, either. Didn't need to. Saw half a preview. Now I've seen the sitcom promos. I'm all set. No more doses of Vardalos, parakalos. Pass the feta instead.
