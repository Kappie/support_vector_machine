I found a place called photobucket, but i still have to move everything.  To look at the screwed pics, right click them and copy the source into your address bar.   ---  In other news, I Pulled out my old sketchbook, with horrible doodles of what i tried to interpret as manga... I ripped all those pages out and started from the other site so it reads right to left. Not because I am trying to imitate the manga feel, but because I am strangely left-handed for small things like a pencil. But I use my right for everything else, and i have learned to use a mouse with the right hand.  I've gotten into drawing before, making a sketchbook out of some computer paper or an empty math spiral. I drew horrible pictures and I even had some how to draw manga books. but just for a hobby i decided to start drawing again. I love creating things and I would like to create things related to what I purchase.  I made websites because I enjoy what sites GIVE to me, I am gonna start drawing because I use pictures drawn by other people.  I got a journal made at my cafepress store. It as the cast of the upcoming webcomic, "farkle" that will be featured on the new version of elads hub.  Well I get to stay home this weekend. Hope I have fun.^_^
