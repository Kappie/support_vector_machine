I started it inspired by NotCuredYet, - I have a lot of the same issues he does - married, sex addicted to the point of not being completely in control at times. Like NotCured, I've never cheated on my wife, but in her mind I cheat nearly continually. Our relationship is okay, but complicated - I'll get into that in later blogs I think.   I understand what my motivation is in writing blogs - at least for me it replaces an unhealthy compulsion, with one that is for the most part harmless. Anyway, when I spend 4 days a week living in hotels and my current project has slowed to the point the I have very little to do, it truly does feel like the devil's workshop. And trust me I've been a pretty diligent worker.  At any rate, I think this may serve as a confessional for me if itservesno other purpose. I encourage anybodyto throw in opinions -a lot of the stuff I'll post is gonna be a lot like the dog post, I'm afraid. The dog thing only scratches the surface of the stuff I need to get out.
