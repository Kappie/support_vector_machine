Got four postcards today...so was very happy about that! But I wont tell Caroline, cos she might get jealous! So anyways, have finished uni for the semester so am now officially in party mode. Although I have scored myself a little job doing marketing/advertising things about 30 hours a week and start tomorrow, so will have to click out of party mode quick smart and go into work mode. Mind you, it really is only going to be four days a week and I will generally start at around 10am and finish at around 4pm, and lunch of course will be fit into that busy schedule somewhere too! Of course, it also happens to be corporate casual, and also located in PRAHRAN! Thank goodness, as everyone knows how much I hate the CBD. Lots of beautiful shops in Prahran, and can pop down to Greville Street, Commercial Road and Chapel Street for lunch so start booking now!!!!!  Great to speak to K yesterday...although I was very drunk....so dont really remember much of it! Sorry if I pushed the engaging time theme, but Gede....oh I tell you later.....  Must run. The beagle needs me!!! (Lol)  All the best for now....And Gede call me sometime!!! Bastards!!!!   James XX  PS. I WANT PRESENTS !!!! LOTS OF THEM!!!!! ;) okay...bye....
