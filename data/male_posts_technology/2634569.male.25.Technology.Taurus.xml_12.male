Push the ashes aside Deal with them later I need a new stick NOW They were never really that important anyway They're just the remains of my life and what matters is now and not then, right?  Sweet, there's the box Yes, a nice long-lasting stick will do this time All set It's time to Let it burn Now all I need is a  Shit, I'm outta matches And what the fuck's with all these ashes...
