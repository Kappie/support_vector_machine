As of today her creatinine levels have returned to almost normal levels, she currently has 50% kidney function and does not need dialysis.  At this point I am ecstatic and I am hoping for a full recovery.   I feel bad for anyone who has to endure dialysis.  Imagine three times a week, having to go sit in a chair, unable to movie for five hours while every drop of blood in you is removed, filtered, and reinserted into your body.  That to me…would suck……!
