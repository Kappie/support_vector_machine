She will be receiving the updates made in the blog to her mailbox. Let us who all will subscribe.   BTW, members of the blog need not subscribe, unless you want to recieve a mail everytime someone posts a message.  Welcome Kavi, try to post as often as you could. Any queries, ask your infy senior Kicha. Convey my regards to Sweet.  Bye for now,
