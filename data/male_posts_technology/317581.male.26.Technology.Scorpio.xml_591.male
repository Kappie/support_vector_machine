I think I was going to mention about how I found this website:   urlLink Being friends   And how it has a fairly easy (step by step) from going from lover to friend. So I was thinking of trying to follow those hints...  There was also this website:   urlLink Love handles   Which has to do with strengthening the love handles. So I was thinking of trying out that as well. I think it's interesting that both articles are mostly talking to women. Is it that I'm so feminine or that I have my sensitive male side thing going on. (metrosexual? Am I a crab person?)  Anyway, I'm running at 7 am tomorrow, I need to sleep.  Peace- T
