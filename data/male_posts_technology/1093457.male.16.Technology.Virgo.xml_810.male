Anyway, she was quite cool and I ended up on duty with her at break time, guarding the main hall from little kiddies trying to vandalise anythign and everything. Turns out she doesn't like anyone else in our tutor group either, so I tink it's a safe bet that i'll be spending a lot of time with her in tutor activities. After lunch I had a geography lesson which was a bit boring but also quite bizarre- the teacher sat us down and explained the usual boring stuff, then said "here's the book cupboard, here's some paper, do something with it" and we were all kind like, 'uh???!' but then she said she wanted us to write notes around the subject of coast lines, ready for our field work trip which is like 4 weeks time! argh! That's then going to be our coursework which has to be done by 5th Novemeber, so it's all getting quite scary already! I also made a sort of buddy in geography called Amy, we shared the books around and helped each other out by swapping notes! how sad am I? I'm jsut desperate to make friends I guess! Anywho, last thing I had french and that was quite funny actually,the teacher I had today is like Mrs Mawer (Jackie will know!), but and english version and slightly less barmy. That was ok! According to Chloe and Garfunkel (? Who knows what his real name is, but Chloe called him Garfunkel) I have a good set of teachers, which includes the head of sixth form and the deputy head, both of which are quite cool. i've also been pursuaded to audition for the school production on Monday night....... CABARET! One MOnday night we all have to go along for 2 hours where we will be taught for a song and dance routine, and then we'll  havbe to go back on Wednesday and actually do the audition to a panel of, um, teachers I guess! Nayway should be a laugh and the 6th form always get heavily involved (so I am assured by various upper 6th and school council members), so what the hell? I'm going along with Chloe and her friends, so should be a laugh if that;s all. Looking forward to tomorrow, Chloe has promised to bring me in her Placebo albums for me to borrow..............
