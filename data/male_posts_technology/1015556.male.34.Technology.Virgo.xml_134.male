We are taking about 30 middle and high schoolers to a nursing home in Columbia and throwing a Valentines Day/Beach party. We are going to have some games, snacks, crafts, etc.  Probably the biggest thing you could pray for is that we are able to communicate the meaning of true love to some of the people that live there. Some specific things that we have planned include: - an activity where residents tell us their 'true love' story. We will have a computer and print out their story on some LLUUUV paper.  A perfect lead in to have someone share their definition of true love. - some students will be leading a time of worship. - one student (Leslie) will be doing a Gospel presentation.  I'm excited, I think its going to be a lot of fun as well as be pretty strategic both in the lives of these students and the people we come in to contact with. Thanks!  Yours, tony
