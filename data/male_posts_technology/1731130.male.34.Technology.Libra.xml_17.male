Unfortunately back in those days, buing an upgrade meant selling your existing computer so I no longer have access to my old gear (except my old TRS-80 Pocket Computer). Well, those days are back through the wonders of  emulation .  A couple of months ago I stumble across MESS. MESS is an emulator par excellance. While you can get software to turn your $3,000 PC (today's prices) into a $200 (1981 prices) dinosaur, the beauty of MESS is that it emulates over 320 different systems.   My personal favourites include: Commodore Vic20 and C64, Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Apple I and Apple IIe, Macintosh+ and Apple Lisa, Tandy TRS-80, MicroBee, Texas Instruments IT-99 and Sony PlayStation. I remember them all!  So, if you're pining for a simpler time, get hold of MESS and re-live your IT childhood. I found it most inspiring.  Link:  www.mess.org
