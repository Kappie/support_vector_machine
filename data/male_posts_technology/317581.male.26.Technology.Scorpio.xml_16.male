So, we can't really tell if we're real or not, Suppose we're a computer program, God know's we're running simulations of our earth on some super computer right now. It has these scripts(people) and they come together and make a blank script, then they add there parts to the new script(babies) then these scripts grow and learn and question, then commune with other scripts. The program runs, the scripts don't know any different, they're all living in their world. Perhaps there used to be users that interacted with the program(the greek gods?) Perhaps the last user to interact with our particular program(They have lots going of course) was Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Suppose there's other users that decided to stay in the program but just be watchers that jump in occasionally(angels and demons if you will). It's an idea.   But the point is, we can never know. It's kinda what the matrix was getting at, but I don't think that we exist outside the computer. God could be the programmer. I don't know, and Cahlen doesn't either. But the thing is Cahlen will talk about it, and I just keep it on the inside and ponder it while driving places.   Dejah, I do want to congratulate you on speaking your mind:) I hope you know Cahlen and I laugh at half the shit he says on here. In case you were wondering, Cahlen and I are still on speaking terms.
