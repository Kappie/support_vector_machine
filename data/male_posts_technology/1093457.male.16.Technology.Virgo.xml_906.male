I haven't done or said anything to annoy them and thats the truth, I have torn it all apart trying to see what I did which has made them hate me but I haven't done anything. Whatever the problem is its theirs and I can't be bothered with them anymore if they are going to be silly. As I said, I am not that upset with it because I have you guys and you are what is important. Tom, glad its all working out for you! Yay! Max, Jo - BLOG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOL.
