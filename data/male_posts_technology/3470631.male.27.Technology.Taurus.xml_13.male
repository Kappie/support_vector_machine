Sorry Tait - but your sister Jessie has entered the Pantheon of hotness. Amazingadsf. Risky D called it the greatest Ass of all time. Now I wouldn't go that far, but she was amazing. The LP has had a collective eye on her since 86 - and has watched her progress from the Minor Leagues to the Bigs. I think she might know she's hot, which is a minus - but seeing as I'll probably never talk to her in my life - so be it.   Saturday night also saw the reunion of Tommy D, Ian, Tait and Risky D. Good times were had by all. Risky D's drive-by comments in the cab at 2 am were hilarious. Needless to say I'm exhausted but that didn't stop me from enjoying a Lobster dinner last night for Father's day - Thanks Pops!  Back to Jessie Larsonasdf sorry. Brad's girlfriend was not shabby either. The Larson family is peaking!! No wonder they didn't want us hanging out with Tait - we've been bringing him down for years!   Closed another deal today for 86 large. Making my yearly total just over 320K. Good times - at this rate I should double my quota - if not triple. Always be closing! A sale is made on every call! 3RIP
