So here is the new, un-improved intro. Welcome to fifteenminutes.What can you expect? I guess the usual - random ramblings by someone with an average intellect and too much spare time surfing the net during office hours. A regular fucking Siegried and Roy extravaganza. Or something. If anything said here offends, or does not meet your political/moral/religious/whatever the fuck viewpoint, remember these words. I Dont Give A Fuck. I Charge For It. peace, out. -kHayne
