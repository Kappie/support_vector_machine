I'm certainly not here for the free beer--cuz there never is any. and i don't venture to think i'd be here for the peace and quiet, cuz you guys are all more trouble than 6 sets of mini-tornado twins.... i guess that just leaves the skankiness of the hot tub sessions... but i haven't been in on one of those in a while so i almost forgot. anyway, what's my friggin point?  oh yeah, as usual i don't have one. well graaaaaaaand.  i loved everyone's refelction pictures! and of course i thought of a great one today. day late and a dollar short? how's about a week past due and a zero shy of the target? that's me.  i hope you all had a fabulous monday. remind me to post again soon--this was fun. well, it was slightly better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick, at least.
