Yea, sure I'd done it before in Singapore under Ah Hee Sensei, but I think I really wanted to learn something from my first Sensei as well.  We were talking to John about it just before Sensei arrived at the dojo. He was surprised (well, actually Sensei was as well) that I had never done it before. He said the last time they did it was pretty recently. Must've been the time when I was back in Singapore. Anyway there was a request and Sensei said it was fine if we wanted to do it that night.  Class started with some kokyu-ho variations. Some I've done, some I've not. She mentioned my ukemi was better than when I started out again. Guess if I didn't bruise myself (surprisingly), I must've learnt something about ukemi the past few months after all. But there is still the part about giving in ukemi that I really really really really need to work on. I'm always afraid to go charging (commit) in as an uke. Think, it's still the fear of being thrown and falling hard against some1's good technique. But I also realised one thing, that if I don't commit properly, I can get injured easily because I probably won't be able to react in a relaxed manner wen taking ukemi. I really ned to work on this issue and resolve this contradiction within me soon. I feel it's a major obstacle in my training right now, and I'm sure I can easily piss of the nage sometimes by not helping them learn the technique. O yea, I also tend to have pretty messed up breathing during  ukemi. That explains how breathless I get. Talking to Begh (housemate), she pointed out to me that in gymnastics (she was on the Singapore's National team, y'see), it was the same thing. That you keep practising and practising to perfect it. They sometimes spend years perfecting a small part which lasts only a few seconds during a sequence of movement. WOW is all I can say, but the link to Aikido is there.  Halfway through class, we switched to bokken. Sensei wanted me to put on the tsuba for my bokken (well since everyone was waiting for me, I'd thought I'd just ask if I really had to put it on). But when I was in Singapore, I was the only one using the tsuba. Haha ironic. Anyway in Singapore, I suspect the tsuba comes separately at an extra cost, so most people never would buy it. Sensei first taught us how we should position the bokken. When seated, the end of the handle of the bokken extends just a few inches above the knees. It is placed on the right side, with the blade ('sharp') edge facing ourselves instead of the person on our right.  You hold the bokken in right stance all the time. Right hand is on the top of the handle, just below the tsuba, and left hand at the bottom. For both hands, the grip is relaxed. You have to grip it in such a way that the back of our hands are both facing us and that the tips of both thumbs is usually away from our view. I've read somewhere that the grip is mainly on the last 3 fingers for each hand instead of the index fingers and thumbs. These two fingers seem to be just a guide of sorts. We are not supposed to hold the bokken like we would hold a machete. When holding the bokken in stance, the end of the handle should be approximately just 1 fist away from our center, with the blade being horizontal. The shoulders, elbows and wrists should be relaxed instead of being locked and stiff.  We started with some basic cuts/shomen strikes first. When raising the bokken, use the wrists a little first to initiate the movement, then just raise the whole arms. Be careful not to raise/lock the shoulders. Blade is raised to behind (and probably just above) our heads. The raising motion also aims to be in such a way as to protect our own shomen with our hands just above our foreheads. When striking, we were told to concentrate just on the last 6 inches of the blade edge and be relaxed. It should bring us back into the starting stance, meaning relaxed posture, unlocked joints, 1 fist away from center, horizontal blade, grip with back facing us and tip of thumbs fairly hidden.  After a few cuts we proceeded on to learn 2 variations of an 8-directional exercise. We had to bear in mind our posture constantly.    First Exercise : We will be facing North, South, West, East, South East, North West, North East, South West  1. North  We were told to raise and cut down. While cutting down, we took a step forwards with the front (right) foot.  1a.  On finishing, Bring the sword up to protect our heads. This is different from the previous raising action we did initially. I'm not sure how I'm suppose to put it into words, so I beg your pardon if the way I'm describing it sounds kinda confusing or silly. This time, the raising motion is done by kind of twisting and raising the hands to our left. Of course hands are still above our forehead. The tip of the blade is now facing the 'imaginary' person opposite us, edge of the blade is facing skywards.  2. South  Now we turn around to our left side 180 degrees, and cut down. You'll find yourself standing with left foot in front and right foot behind. (But hands still same as original - hands will never change position here.)  2a.  Bring sword up by twisting hands right and up at the same time to our forehead. Tip of edge faces our opponent.  3. West  Now we move our back foot to our front (but don't pass the front foot), and while we cut, just slide to the right by 90 degrees.  3a.  Raise the bokken by twisting the hands left and up to our forehead again, blade tip facing our front again.  4. East  Turn 180 degrees left to face behind and cut down again. You might realise we have just finshed North, South, West, East directions.  4a.  Raise the sword as we originally did, both hands to our forehead, blade tip pointing behind the head now  5. South East  When cutting, move back foot to face right by 45 degrees.  5a.  Raise hands left and up such that blade tip faces our front.  6. North West  Turn left by 180 degrees and cut as well.  6b.  Raise hands right and up with blade tip facing front.  7.North East  Move back foot 90 degrees to right and cut at same time.  7b.  Raise hands left and up keeping blade tip facing front.  8. South West  Turn 180 degrees left and cutting down.   Second Exercise : We will be facing North, South, East, West, South West, North East, North West, South East Please note that the second exercise is similar. Difference is that because the first step has changed it also alters the side in which you will be turning. But the angles will be the same. So are the raising and cutting movements.  1. North  We were told to raise and cut down. While cutting down, we took a step forwards with the back (left) foot.  1a.  On finishing, Bring the sword up to protect our heads by twisting and raising the hands to our right. Tip of the blade is now facing the front.  2. South  Now we turn 180 degrees right side, and cut down. You'll find yourself standing with right foot in front and left foot behind.  2a.  Bring sword up by twisting hands left and up at the same time to our forehead. Tip of blade pointed front.  3. East  Now we move our back foot to our front (but don't pass the front foot), and while we cut, just slide 90 degrees to the left.  3a.  Raise the bokken by twisting the hands right and up to our forehead again, blade tip facing our front again.  4. West  Turn 180 degrees right to face behind and cut down again. You might realise we have just finshed North, South, West, East directions.  4a.  Raise the sword as we originally did, both hands to our forehead, blade tip pointing behind the head now  5. South West  When cutting, move back foot to left by 45 degrees.  5a.  Raise hands right and up such that blade tip faces our front.  6. North East  Turn right by 180 degrees and cut as well.  6b.  Raise hands left and up with blade tip facing front.  7.North West  Move back foot 90 degrees to left and cut at same time.  7b.  Raise hands right and up keeping blade tip facing front.  8. South East  Turn 180 degrees right and cutting down.  You can repeat the exercises by turning back to North direction again. Throughout we really need to keep posture, and sword grip and position in mind.  Interesting huh. Damn cool man. Can't wait to learn more. It's a pity there won't be class next Tues as Sensei will be away for awhile. Wednesday's class will be taken by someone else (Paul, I think).
