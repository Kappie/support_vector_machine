Interesting reading. Very strategic and intelligent.   There are a plethora of other columns on his site, on such varied topics as prototypes to production runs, and what he thinks of the direction Apple is going now. (predictably, he's a System 9 fan, who has had a hard time accepting OSX.)  As a commentator, Tog is too focused to be really general, but he has a kind of useful concentration on usability, information density, and human/machine interface. He's an Interaction Architect, and not much else. But he does it well, so bookmark him for when you're thinking of GUI design, or your poor customers.
