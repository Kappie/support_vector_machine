Went to Tassie and picked up the Evo on 10/07, which was a bit of fun I guess. It hasn't been without its dramas though.      1. Windscreen wasn't sealed properly.      2. Mitsubishi screwed up registering the VIN so it couldn't be registered on the Monday, and had to remain undriven for another 24 hours.      3. Car got broken into at Shaney's place on the night of the 12th - my iPAQ, GPS and bag with a whole bunch stuff were stolen.      4. Window didn't get repaired until the 15th.      5. Windscreen didn't get fixed until yesterday.      Still I think the car is almost everything I dreamed of. The only thing I want to do is extract just a leetle bit more power out of it (new ECU) and that should be fine...           Anyway tomorrow is 6(!) weeks since I met Shaney, and things have been going pretty darn well (hence the silence here I guess).      Definately in luuurrrve :)      I guess there's a bit more to say about it than that, but I'll do that some other time.. gotta ponder how to put it into words I guess. oH and there's a whole bunch of shanny g stories as well :)      .out
