Had to wait for the main person for last night's exercise. (Note: Exercise here means the activity that needed to be done last night; and not those exercise where you have to get into darn tight leotards, although if I wanted to, I could have gone to the office wearing leotards.. but then again, the guards might actually arrest me... heheheh....) Anyway, the exercise last night was to complete the shadow image we created that evening. It took a couple of minutes, all in all, it took us roughly 40-50 minutes, this plus the discussion, the scribbling down notes, and the 'what was that again' from us who wasn't as good as the main guy.  After that, I went straight to 7-11 to get some snacks for my parents and for the birthday celebration today. I'll talk about that a bit later on. Anyway, bought two bars of Cadbury chocolates. Bought the type without nuts or raisins or whatever else they put in chocolates nowadays. I love the plain type. Fantastic. Seriously. Breaking a piece, putting it in your mouth, savouring the taste, letting the chocolate melt on your tongue, then playing around with it in your mouth, getting the taste of it all over the insides of your mouth. Then licking it clean. Fantastic....  As I was saying earlier, today in the office, we had this big birthday celebration. This party was for everyone whose birthdays are from January till June. And I was one of them. We got mugs that says "Selamat Hari Lahir", and "PTM" on one side, and my name on the other side. It's nice. I really like the mug. Thanks guys. Although I know none of my office mates reads my blog, except for one person. Thanks, this one person. Heheheh...  Am currently reading "Last Man Standing" by David Baldacci. Darn good book. Darn right it is. My uncle passed me the book through my cousin, who was suppose to read it, then pass it to me. But then she said she couldn't go on reading the book because she found it boring. Well, not to me! I can't put the book down. It's so action packed and interesting. Haven't finish reading it, though. Am taking my time with it, so I can enjoy it more. And am also currently reading Michael Moore's "Stupid White Men". It's funny, but I sort of stopped reading it the moment I got Mr Baldacci's book.
