You tend to loose more in the first two weeks than in the remaining. This is a good thing. I don't think loosing 5 pounds a week would be very healthy, and I mean the renal failure type of unhealthy. But it's dang motivating nonetheless.  Here's what went right this week: - My wife is going to do the  urlLink Weekend to End Breast Cancer  walk in Vancouver at the end of august so she's been doing training walk. She had a 24k scheduled for Canada Day, so I joined in. Though sore, it felt good, and I'm sure a 3 1/2 hour walk has to burn a calorie or two! - I was vigilant about my food journal. Keeping track of what I eat really shows me what I did and didn't need. - I usually drink a good deal of water, but I drank twice what I usually do. Probably 64-80 fl. oz. a day.  What went wrong: Canada day/4th of July means visitors and barbecues. We had one with a friend on Friday, and I'd planned for it. I knew I'd go a bit over my target for the day, but since we were buying the food we could control it as well. We didn't want to serve "diet" food to our friend, but we didn't need to go crazy either. So that was fine. However, we had another friend visit the next day, and originally we though we'd go out for dinner. However, friend set #3 invited us all over for yet another BBQ. Oh oh, these two friends aren't exactly svelte. And, to top it off, due to a large breakfast, I'd skipped lunch, and dinner was late. So, ugh, I gorged on their appetizers. Chips, dips, cheese, crackers. I couldn't even keep track. Well, so my journaling was vigilant EXCEPT for Saturday evening.  I was really worried that my food orgy would blow the week and I wouldn't post a loss. Well, I didn't need to worry obviously. I think I was good enough for the rest of the week that I still lost that mysterious water. Next week we don't have any functions planed other than a private dinner and movie, so I can order something sensible and skip the buttered popcorn.  I promise to post some pictures soon. It's too late to do it now, I'd wake up our visitors since the computer is next to their room and it's way past my bedtime!
