It seems that people are often upset by something they are passionate about and can influence others to become passionate about it as well. I have some empathy, but I think that when it comes to ideas that don't really affect me, I can't really become passionate about it. I think I am an apathetic person living in an apethetic society.  I want to feel, to hunger, to thirst, to become enraged, to boil over.   I made it to Oregon and I even remembered to blog :) Tim
