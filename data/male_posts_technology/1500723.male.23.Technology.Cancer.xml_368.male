       
       Convince your enemy that he will gain very little by attacking you. This will diminish his anthusiasm.  Even if you are very strong, never be ashamed to feign weakness; this will make your enemy act imprudently and attack too soon.  In war, the key to victory is the ability to surprise one's opponent.            The Art of War  (Sun Tzu)
