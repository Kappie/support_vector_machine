Haiz, and wat a mess it was. Anyway, William was damn happy about the off. You could tell that he worked a little faster than normal. I think Neo and I only wanted to clear up what we could before we left. I was seriously pondering if I should stay on instead of leaving. Leaving camp in the middle of a day when there's no transport provided is a serious burden on my transport cost (in fact I think I forgot to scan my card when I alighted the bus home... argh!! $2.40 gone.). Decided to go for the off because the 2 guys were pretty tired from lastnight's function and they really wanted the rest. If I was the only one who stayed on, it seems a wee bit like I was spoiling market for them. Anyway, William did lompang us all out to the MRT.  I dunno, I can tell some people weren't very happy about us getting the off when they didn't. I had a serious talk about how the young NSFs feel about things like off. I seriously can't stand the way some of them think. Granted some of them are practically 20-ish kids but I seriously dun remember being so particular about whether I get to take off or not. Even lasttime, I rarely asked for any and I'd just accepted those that did came my way. The only time I asked for off was when I couldn't cover enough days with my leave so that I can depart Singapore for my Uni's induction programme in UK. I think it's normal to be given off by someone else, but a direct superior, due to dept work commitments, is unable to release his men for the off they had been given. What's wrong with that? As the SAF always say, off is a privilege, not an entitlement.  And I can't stand the selfish attitude some people have in NS. We had to shift some tables back to our bunks this morning. Some would only shift what was rightfully suppose to be in their bunks and leave the rest of the stuff untouched. Some went on to lie on their beds to rest while others cleared up the other stuff. Some would be so scared of doing things one way that they'd do everything by the book and it can really seriously piss people off as well. Flexibility in a lot of matters is necessary. Without a bit of EQ when it comes to doing stuff, it's easy to offend someone. And in this world, it's always good to be on good terms with people and just practice a little Aiki-attitude. Do others a little favour because you dunno when you'll need help from others someday.  My unit has a seen a lot of improvements compared to when I was around. Vice versa, there's a horrible and ugly side which I saw a lot of this morning in the unit. Espirit de corp is not a quality that has been cultivated into my unit. I miss the old days when life was simple and all you needed to do was do things together. Eat, suffer, play, enjoy together. The army teaches us a lot of stuff. Maintaining the right attitude, being an example for your peers to follow - work harder than others if it's an area of your forte to influence others to work as hard, help when you can, be cordial to people, even more so to others not in your unit, and especially so where a co-operative effort may be needed someday. Start everything nicely but end them even nicer. Don't keep thinking of what posible rewards you will receive because it will only blind you from putting in 100% to finish the job at hand.  A lot of nasty attitude and examples were experience this morning in a short span of just 4hrs. Detailing all of them out will take too much effort and pointless. These are matters I hope to foget when I go to bed. But if people with the right attitude appear a lot more, they do provide a more positive atmosphere for me to work in. These are the only things and people I want to remember when I leave.
