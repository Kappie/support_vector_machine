Night Shyamalan" I knew that it was a hoax.  And now the entertainment "press" are boo-hoo-ing that they were made to look silly because they weren't in on the joke.  Cry me an f-ing river!  The suits are falling all over themselves with apologies because nobody knows what to do with actual creativity.  I don't know if this is sad or just plain stupid.
