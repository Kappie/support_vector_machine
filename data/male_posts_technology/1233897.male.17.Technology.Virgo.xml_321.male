I don't know really what it was... No, I take that back, I know exactly what it was... Standing there singing, sitting there listening to the message, I couldn't quite keep my attention on what was happening around me. Mind wandering, thoughts drifting, faded memories coming back again to haunt my mind: I'm starting to think I really don't have a place anymore... Everything at church seems so vague, so foreign now, everything at school seems like wishful memories or weeping past, everything at home seems well, horrible. Everywhere I turn I'm reminded of something I'm trying to let go of, was trying to let go of. Then I begin to retrace my steps and realize that I shouldn't be trying to let go of it at all... Or should I? It's been almost eight months now and I still can't figure it out.  What's best for her?  What's best for me?  ...  God, why can't I just tell her how much I'm in love with her?  *cries himself to sleep*
