The Allies raid the camp where the ceremony is taking place, but not before a demon - Hellboy - has already been conjured. Joining the Allied forces, Hellboy eventually grows to adulthood, serving the cause of good rather than evil.  Yes, that is the plan for tonight... Two hours in the company of a red monster from hell... To me, that is a very nice way to spend a Thursday evening. And if the movie is as good as the reviews say, well then we are definitely in for a treat.   Have you ever tried to book a trip somewhere for the weekend, on Wednesday morning? No? Try it! Spontaneity is a wonderful thing and adds tons of excitement to dull, grey, rainy everyday life. It doesn't have to be anything other than just a little visit with friends you don't see very often, just to get out of the city and away from normality.  Life can be pretty good if you give it a chance...
