Had lunch with homeless people in two parks in DC.  Saw three other church groups give away food but not engage the people.  Our students noticed. Over 20 significant conversations over lunch. Some students gave away all of their food and didn't eat. Worked in the Capital Area Food Bank for three hours in the distribution warehouse. Packed over 600 food packs. Students most impacted by exposure to the homeless and engaging them in conversation over lunch. Some also impacted by being hungry while working and relating that to being without food for an extended period of time.
