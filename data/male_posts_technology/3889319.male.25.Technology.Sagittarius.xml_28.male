I never thought i would have such a fun happy day. I was surprised to talk to Mauricio today.. It has been a while since we last met or talked. We talked for some time on the MSN and it was so damn good, He saw me after 3 years on my camera, but he didn't have a camera, so he went out and bought one. We talked about all the things we used to do when we were together in Spain.. Shooting frogs, killing turtles, peeking at the nannies... The best days of my life were probably in Spain and the UK. I went to Spain 3 times maybe and twice to the UK and it was fun with Mauricio.  I was glad that he is doing well, getting married next year. Carol has an 8 days old baby girl. The business is going well, and they are all seems to be ok since my uncle passed away. I had the chance to see his mom Mary, she is an amazing strong woman, his fiance and a client :D.  I was surprised to know that Mauri is managing the business and doing so well with it. I never thought he would make such a success in his life.. He is smart, but he was a big trouble for his mom and dad, lazy, bad in school.. I'm happy for him.  This is touching.. I love them all and i miss them all so much. Hope i'll be able to meet them soon.
