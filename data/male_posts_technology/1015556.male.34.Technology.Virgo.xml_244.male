Check out their missions page  urlLink here .  I like the whole consortium idea - "loose confederation of churches whose goal is to send new missionaries from our churches overseas as quickly and expeditiously as possible." That's a great idea. Three churches that I know in this consortium: Black Rock - Kevin Butterfield - who was the youth pastor, is a high school friend of D.  The first time I met Kevin was at SEMP in 2000 when he did a concert of prayer.  I had only heard the name before, I had no idea who he really was. Trinity - D's family's home church.  And  urlLink Len Evans  who is a part of YPNation. Valley Community - I heard the missions pastor speak last Fall about short term trips at an ACMC conference.  He is money.
