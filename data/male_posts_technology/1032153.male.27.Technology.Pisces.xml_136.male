As leader, you tend to have to deal with things that others might not know, that can just make you really wonder what God is doing. I feel so upset sometimes for the spiritual state of some of the young people. I really hurt inside for them. And it seems that even though I cry out to God for them, that he doesn't answer in the way that would seem best to me. But I am not God, and God knows best. I just wish that not one of them would depart from the path that leads to life, that all would be saved.
