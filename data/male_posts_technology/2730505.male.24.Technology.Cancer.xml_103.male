Actually I just wanted to stay in EL for another day!  But nope, I live in the real world and work in the real world so I had to do what I had to do.  At work, it was just a little to hectic for me to enjoy myself at work.  I don't know if I was being rude to a lot of people but I know I was being indifferent and not showing much emotion.  Eh oh well, they'll just deal I guess.  My dad called sunday night to see how to fix the monitor.  It was not working.  I don't exactly know what could have happened but I suggested to unplug it from the computer and try it on their laptops.  I'm not sure if they did that but it looks like they didn't.  My mom then called Monday night to see if I wanted to come over for some shabu shabu.  See, the way we do it is we boil the water and all the stuff in it already and have the raw ingedients ready on the side.  by the time I got there last night, it was already made.  They made it the day before so I think it still counts as shabu shabu.  I got there and looked at the computer.  Unplugged the power cable and plugged it back in.  It worked!  so I proceeded to do laundry at my parents house and eat dinenr there.  Before I had dinner I went to the mall to see if they have the shoes that I want for cheap.  they did, but it was still the same price.  I also perused the "From Chicago, With Love" store for any touristy goodies that are worth getting but I guess getting people you don't know little gifts might freak them out.  Whatever I guess. Went home and had dinner.  It was good.  shabu shabu, rice and philipino style pork chops and salad.  yeah.  It was a good dinner.  I put some aside for lunch today and I can't wait to eat it!  3 more hours and I can go eat!  I also watched one my shows.  So besides Star Trek (the new one with Scott Bacula, formerly of Quantum Leap), Star Gate and Smallville.  I also try to follow the stupid drama One Tree Hill.  yeah.  I know I am a sap.  Whatever.  I don't judge people with what they watch so whatever.  anyways.  I did that and it hit a little close to hime because it dealt with pregnancy and having a kid way too early.  I got somewhat bothered by it all, I wasn't balling or anything, I was just thinking of what could be if other paths were taken.  It really is no use to think like that because it already happened but sometimes you just can't help it.  After that I finished my laundry and went home.  Called the girlfriend and talked for a while.  She was tired and stressed from all the studying that she has to do for her last three weeks of school for this year.  I tried to alleviate her stress by talking about other things that isn't school.  Like a little break.  I don't know if it worked but I gave it a shot.  Called her again later in the night to talk to her about a problem that seems to keep coming back.  It's going to be okay.  Things will get and be better baby.  after that I couldn't sleep for a little bit so I made some nachos and cracked open a miller lite and watched the late edition of sports center.  I fell asleep after a little while of that.  Woke up and went to work and here I am.  Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead and philipino pork chops for lunch.  It was also recently brought to my attention that Worms3d came out so I will look at the local blockbuster for a copy to rent.  Wish me luck!
