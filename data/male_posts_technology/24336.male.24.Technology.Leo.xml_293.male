Since Solaris 8 does not support my GeForce video card, my resolution topped off at 640x480 in glorious black and white. Pathetically, Solaris doesn't support any of the video cards I have in my Box 'O Random Hardware.    The BORH is actually much lighter than usual since I offloaded 4 modems, 2 sound cards, 4 hard drives and 1 floppy drive on my grandfather.  I just hope I have enough hardware to build a spare computer...  Anyway,  urlLink eBay  might be the source for Solaris solace, since I could get a supported vid card for like $20.
