I've discovered that when I don't get a good dose of music during my day, I simply don't function as well.  As such, I've been using a little program called  urlLink NetRadio  to listen to a  urlLink ShoutCast -based radio station called  urlLink Club 977 .  They play 80's music.  Now to get to the point of all this rambling.  Club 977 frequently plays a one-hit-wonder song by Peter Schilling called "Major Tom".  After being re-introduced to this little ditty, I recalled how much I like it.  It has a very haunting melody, and a really nice beat.  One of my co-workers told me yesterday he considered it "creepy".  I found this odd, but then again, I have never really listened to the lyrics (I'm more of a "music" guy, not a "lyrics" guy), so today I looked 'em up.  Now I had already known of another "Major Tom" from a David Bowie hit from the 70's, but had no idea these two tunes were actually somewhat "related".  So I found this web site, which gives a nice write-up on the song and it's tie to Bowie's tune.  Pretty interesting stuff.
