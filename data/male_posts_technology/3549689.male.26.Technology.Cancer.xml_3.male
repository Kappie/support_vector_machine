Blogger doesn't support Trackbacks yet, and if it is important to you, you might want to try jroller or other more advanced blogging sites, but if you're not fussy (like me, currently) this is a neat workaround. There are others like  urlLink Wizbang's Standalone Trackback Form  but that one didn't work for me.
