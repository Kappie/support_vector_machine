I anxiously awaited my invitation to join and finally it arrived.  The thing I notice first and I assume everyone does is the 1000 MBs of storage capacity.  This and the clean look is what sets Google apart from the rest of Web Based email.  In my opinion the most important thing about GMail is not the 1000 MBs of storage, but the clean look to it.  Opening GMail, Yahoo, and Hotmail side by side, GMail is the only one not plagued with tons of banner ads.   In the near future GMail will start with the Google Adwords, but AdWords in general are much less annoying than banners, popups, and popunders.  They allow me to focus more on the content than the ads, but at the same time AdWords are more relevant than the normal banner ad which means sometimes even I click on them to read their content.  In summary GMail is the Ferrari of web mail services.  Itâ€™s clean, fast, reliable, and good looking.  The only thing I see lacking is the inability to use POP3 email which is why GMail could never be my primary email service.
