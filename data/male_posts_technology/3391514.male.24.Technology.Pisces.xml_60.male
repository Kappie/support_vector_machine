I was most impressed... it had a good plot, to which the special effect were actually secondary, the acting was reasonable and the script believable.  8.5 / 10, and better than the first.   Heroland  v1.1 was finished this afternoon, and I got a friend of mine to test it.  As expected, there are problems.  Powers are too expensive and weak, and Super Stats are far too good for their cost... I intend to make some tweaks for whenever I get a new test going.  The oft-delayed RPG got a second run in as many weeks... it was alright but nothing exciting.  I'm having difficulty adjusting to my character, and it all seems a bit slow.  I wonder if the second group got to do more?  The game involves time travel, and presently, the disappearance of an entire city.  Given the groups inherent paranoia (spilling over from the previous game), I suggested that we may be the ones responsible - saving the city... from us?  I managed to get a short game on  UFO: Aftermath , and met the feared "Alien Rocket Launcher" and even more feared "Microslug Accelerator".  Basically, they're advanced alien weapons that blow the hell out of your troops.  The tech boys are hard at work developing new and more deadly versions though.  And mind control works!  Speaking of mind control,  UFO  is going much better, and my psionic task force is becoming one to be feared.  Floaters, Reapers, Snakemen and Mutons fall to my mind powers easily!  The best event was the "Mexican standoff" between three Sectoids.
