The steel guitar joins in on this verse (the second), and it really gets me when it picks up the melody in the chorus along with the vocal.  It's very understated and surprisingly unlike the standard steel guitar solo.  Almost makes you forget the blatant Darwinism in the first verse.    And another thing... I'm really glad "Pennsylvania" has the same number of syllables as "West Virginia" so I can sing more appropriately and from the heart.
