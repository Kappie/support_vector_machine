It turns out that I am the unluckiest person alive, I actually won the first tournament in my young career, then lost it because I'm a fucking pussy that can't say no....they made me play fucking 5-Card-Draw, the all-time worst game ever, I FUCKING HATE THAT GAME! And of course, do to more bullshit and crap, and human feces, I lost. And then, in another poker tournament after all that shit, I lost again due to bullshit, (ie. me losing to the only hand that can beat me, it seems as that happens ALL THE FUCKING TIME!!!) I don't even know why I play poker anymore, it just causes me to be pissed off at stupid shit like this.   For those of you who don't know, the 2nd worst feeling in the world for me, is losing, losing anything at all, wether it be a simple poker hand, or a baseball game or something. I FUCKING HATE IT. and nobody seems to get it. When I lose, I get annoyed/mad/pissed/whatever. NO SHIT! I'm not gonna sit there a loser saying something like "oh well hes a much better player than me, and deserves the money more than I do." Bullshit. Does anybody ever watch Phil Helmuth play, err, lose rather? He's a much worse sore loser, than me.  I did find out however, that I can read people really well. I can usually tell people what they have by the way they act and how they bet and all that. 4/5 times when somebody bets, I can tell what they have, and be right about it. But, I don't trust what I think and I end up calling anyway, because I have the top two pair, and theres a small chance that they could be bluffing. Like today, I was playing against my Mom and Popham. Nearly everytime I had the 2nd best hand (which seemed like every damn time) I said out loud what they had that kicked my ass, and was right. And a couple of months ago when we were playing, I called Glen's pocket pairs nearly every time, and when Schiffman played the one time, I said out loud that hes bluffing, but I didn't trust myself, and folded...I would've fucking won. And a couple weeks after that, Jason bet like $4 on some crap, and he was kind of nervously tapping his foot on the ground, and I said out loud that hes bluffing to everyone, 3 people besides hime were still in...nobody called...and I was right, again. I just don't know what the fucks wrong with me, and why the fuck I even play poker anymore. It just is starting to seem like a big ass waste of time and money. Even though I consider myself better than a lot of the people out there, and even though I'm only 16....
