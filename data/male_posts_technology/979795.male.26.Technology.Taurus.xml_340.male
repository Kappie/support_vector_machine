New sofa came today as well. I was quite irritated with the delivery people. Original arrangement was that they will remove our old set for $20 when the new set comes. I told them it was arranged in advance and even written on the order slip in black and white. The delivery people were still insisting that they can't do it. What peeved me off a little was their response came pretty much when they heard that they were going to be paid $20 (only). I got the impression they'll probably do it for more money instead (I've always thought such things usually got done at a rate of $50). Finally, easiest response was we didn't want to accept the new sofa and would like to cancel the order. Now they had to call their office and ask. There was a lot of arguing and finger pointing, though not in a really nasty way. More like them saying aloud "Customer won't listen to me, you go and talk to him yourself." etc over the phone. I was getting pretty irritated as well. In the end we said, we'll accept only whenever they are ready to take over our old sofa. Way I see it, several thing made me pretty mad with them. One, they delayed delivery beyond the original delivery date. Two, the taking over of the old sofa was arranged when my mom placed the order and it was written in black and white. Three, the way the delivery people reacted when they heard of the $20 was seriously negative like a "Impossible!" or a "No way!". Four, when we talked to the manager of the store, he actually had the audacity to say something like he has no control over the delivery people. If he has no control then who does? Oh please. We're not not unreasonable people here either. We can see their truck is too full to take our old sofa set. Their suggestion was for us to leave the old set in the carpark first and they'll be back tomorrow. But we have no guarantee they will return to collect the old one after we accept the new set now. My dad's back isn't good and there's no way I can shift it out alone either. Plus our estate management do not allow such things to be done. And there's absolutely no space to leave it outside the house as there are more than one household in the estate who own more than one car. It was simply ridiculous. If they'd only just come back later when they're truck has space, I don't see why we can't work it out. But the driver just kept saying it's too late lah, cannot lah, etc etc. Idiot! Ironic thing was that, after one hour they called back saying they now have space to takeover our sofa and handover our new set. DUUUH!!! Anyway, I'm just glad that episode is over. I think I've already done my part. Despite paying them $20, I still helped them carry the sofa out as well. Maybe I should've kept $10 for myself instead. God knows, I needed the cash anyway... My father was quite insistent that we let them carry all the sofas but that would've been impossible, mean and physically impossible anyway.  Begh (UK housemate) SMSed me about grabbing some coffee tonight. Was supposed to go, but the whole episode above delayed my dinner and I didn't eat till like 8-ish. Had to cancel the appointment.  Anyway spent most of today finishing up my book 'Black Hawk Down' and going through my Java ePrep modules online. I think I can finish the unit I'm on by this weekend and quite possibly start on the second unit. In total I've 3 units to complete and another course on Computer Security. Hohum... too much time to spare at home anyway. Just started reading Lord of the Rings and realised it's not exactly an easy read. The book I got had small prints and that didn't really help. I'll probably take a long time to finish this book. Worse, I promised a friend to finish another book she had recommended. I just might KIV LoTR first.  When lifting the heavy sofa today, I was careful not to make my back any worse than it seemed to feel. Fact was, it seemed to be recovering fine this past week. If nothing goes wrong tomorrow, I'm probably going down to Siglap for training and to pay my mat fees as well. Owed it too long already. Talk about owing, I also need Sensei to sign my grading book and pass him the grading CDs ;P. Lucky I've packed all this in my bag already. Hope Gary's degenerative brain syndrome won't affect me haha.
