I've also started to leave my main laptop (dell) at the office so I'm writing this on a spare compaq/fedora lappy.  Have to say say the dell is set up so well at the moment, I can code away and everything is set just the way I like it. Even though I don't use Dreamweaver visual stuff I still prefer it to the other IDE's I've seen. I've tried Zend and gPHP etc but I've used Dreamweaver since day dot so it's like switching from photoshop to gimp, it's just not going to happen!  I've also been working alot more in Fedora Core 2, I have to say it it a nice distro and I can see how people are saying that linux is ready for the desktop esp using FC2 for a while. I have to say though for some reason I prefer Debian to Fedora for no logical reason except i'm a debian fan boy :)  Hmm I considering going in the office and doing some work there but there is a copy of tony hawk pro skater 3 sitting on my desk that may attack me and force me to play it. Maybe it's safer to stay at home :)
