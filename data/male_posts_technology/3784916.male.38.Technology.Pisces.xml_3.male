I'm now working for this behemoth of a company and I need an outlet for my extroverted nature.  That is NOT to say that my family and friends aren't wonderful outlets for that, but there is nobody to speak with about the line between professional and personal activities.  This is the start of an interesting adventure.  As with many things in my life, I'm not sure that it will continue.  We can only hope.  I don't even care if anybody reads these things.  I simply need an outlet.  I'm toying with the notion of starting a book.  If I don't do that, my kids will hopefully be able to read this and understand some of the things that I go through.  I'm going to start with a couple of basis precepts: 1. I love my family, most important thing -- I'll write about them often. 2. Holy phrase -- variety is the spice of life 3. Work is important, but a means to an end. 4. Close friends are as important as family. 5. I'm sporadic and impatient, but always interesting.  I hope you enjoy reading these daily or intra-day posts to the blog.  I hope I'll enjoy writing them.
