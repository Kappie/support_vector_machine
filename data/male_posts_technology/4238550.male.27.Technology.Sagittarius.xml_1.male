After a long time Liverpool has won game from coming back from 1-0 down. was suppose to meetup with Alvin, too lazy to club... Ragu was out in VIP2 enjoying his B'day...boy..hes 28 for godsake! met up with my pool kakis and game was good! dis time my placings were more or less perfect! Ruthi online... was upset and shocked that after removing her tumor from ovaries, she culd not conceive anymore... shes the first gal i gotta know thru the net.. been 4 yrs... A young mexican lawyer...  the news is sad... at a young age...i culd sense her bitterness... Pray that god will have a better path for her...  sunday was as usual..went to temple... stayed n meditate longer then usual.... felt more disturbed i suppose... we can only appreciate things after they are gone. kept myself preparing for tomorrow's grand launch of the SFA project... boi..its gonna be a tiring day... have not attended to jerry's  PC yet..  oh ya...
