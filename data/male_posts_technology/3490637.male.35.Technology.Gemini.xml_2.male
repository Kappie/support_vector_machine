Work horsed up that trail like beat down donkey, two kids attached the whole way up and down, pounding my knees, straps digging my shoulders, sweat working my crotch into a four-alarm fire.  The water, everywhere. In the stream. On the high pass, on the cedars bows. And on the trail. Rolling across the rocks, past the roots. On my shoes; over my ankles. Wet feet.  My children attached to me--the youngest, Samantha is only eight weeks. She slept most of the way, periodically waking, cooing and falling back asleep. Madison, three, talked to me all day, asking me questions, followed by the staccato, "Why?". Curious, naive and so impressionable, she wanted to climb a tree with a ladder she believed her Uncle Freddie was hauling to the top of this eight mile endeavor. But still, not a person in sight, until we started to meet the returnees from the trip.  An east coast family working their way slowly back down after a graduation celebration at the University of Washington. A gay man wit his two girlfriends, who were lost, "We're turning around". An overweight man with a buck knife tied to his hip--vintage Nike nylon shorts stuck to his buldged frame like a wet sheet of visqueen against a ballon.  The weather held, but started to rain as we meandered back to the trail. Of course, this is the wild reality, you are dependent upon yourself, in a wilderness as rugged and remote as any in the world. Yet 80 short miles away is a populace of two plus million, teaming across four lane highways, living off shipments from ocean liners arriving from the remote ports in Asia. I had dream last night about this. Living in the moment....
