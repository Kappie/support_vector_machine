I had heard this film was incredibly bias but I was surprised at the restraint that was actually used. Sure Bush and his pals cop it, but David Letterman has probably showed Bush to be more of an idiot and incompetant than Moore has managed to. I did enjoy the film and it was good to see almost absolute majority new footage of Iraq war. The images of the civillian and army casualties was pretty horrific but the interviews with the teenage officers was even more shocking. I thought it was a bit too broad of a subject and I would of been more interested if the whole movie would have been of Bush, he intrigues me. The stunts Moore pulled weren't very elaborate and didn't really prove much but the interviews and research were insightful. Not as good as Bowling For Columbine and seemed a little rushed but I guess he was trying to put it out in time for the election. Story: 3/5    Production: 4/5    Film: 7/10
