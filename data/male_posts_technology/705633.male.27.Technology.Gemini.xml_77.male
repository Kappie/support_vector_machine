They have changed the DJ in there now, (so long Neville.. don't let the door hit your ass on the way out, hahaha) and it's a OK blend of commercial dance/trance.  We had our normal jug each, and a blonde/brunette tag team was soon sniffing Custard. We had the presence of mind to buy a disposable camera, so expect pictures very soon. Then we headed over to Traders and had a flat liner each. Flat liners have achieved legendary status with us. A shot glass, half tequila, half sambucca and about 10 drops of Tabasco sauce. John nailed his and pelted it across the dance floor to the bogs, me and Custard chasing him with the camera to catch the infamous "Mallet pavement pizza", which never happened. Maybe he's learning some self-control in his old age?  So then we went into Follies for a bit, the music was OK but it got too packed as normal so we split for GAP at about half one. That's about as much as I can remember, except deciding to leave Custard's house because John has a snore that could cut through bank vaults.  Highlight of the evening - John running full pelt into a Euro bin, assisted by Custard. (Pictures to follow..)  Who says you can’t have a sophisticated night out in St Helier ?
