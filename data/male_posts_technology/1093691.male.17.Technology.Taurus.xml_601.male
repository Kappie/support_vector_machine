Alpa has had a baby called Shey, and was covering for Tatuna today so she could take her kids out for the day (btw Tatuna is Tina's real name, I can see why she shortens it to Tina instead of Tuna). We got a lot of work done, and had a laugh at Alpa who couldn't remember a thing after 3 months off and swore quite a lot!!! Anyways! Tom has just accepted to do my job while i#'m on holiday, which proably means he'll get to meet Kinnou and Kishan, although kishan won't speak to anyone anyway, kinnou just throws herslef at random strangers!  Anywho, yes. hot day,. Lovelly. Got a headache. Marvellous. Fun. Mystery tour 14th September. Yay. Whaey. Must go. Alcohol. bye
