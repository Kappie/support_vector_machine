Once a month, planned in advance, we are all out in town in our Sunday best. 2) New shirts. No, really.  3) People stop being slack and commit to a least a small post once a week, maybe with a picture of a breast or something thrown in so we get hits. 4) We recruit. I propose Damien as he wasn't a big wussy had his tequila shot like a good boy. 5) Er.. still thinking about 5.  So Return of the King has officially opened. I just hope it's better than the steaming pile of dog-poo that was the Matrix Revolutions.  I don't want to ruin anything but I heard that Gandalf is caught giving head to Samwise Jamjar and that the evil firey eye thing is actually Frodo's own vindaloo ring-piece because he's asleep in his hobbit hole after eating too many curried eggs. Also Agent Smith disowns Liv Tyler because she hooked up with Arawhore, who secretly fancies Legoman. But Legoman is already in love with Gimley because he's really good at plating hair. (That whole paragraph was bollocks, purely to wind up Baity who is probably going to end up with a tattoo of Tolkien across his forehead.)   Did you ever stop and wonder...... (sent to me from Grist) Who was the first person to look at a cow and say, "I think I'll squeeze these pink dangly things here, and drink whatever comes out?" Who was the first person to say, "See that chicken there... I'm going to eat the next thing that comes out of it's bum." Why do toasters always have a setting so high that burns the toast to a horrible crisp, which no decent human being would eat? Why is there a light in the fridge and not in the freezer? Why do people point to their wrist when asking for the time, but don't point to their bum when they ask where the bathroom is? Why does  the  Gynae leave the room when you get undressed if they are going to look RIGHT up there anyway? If corn oil is made from corn, and vegetable oil is made from vegetables, then what is baby oil made from? Why does  the Alphabet song and Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star have the same tune? Stop singing and read on . . . . . .. . . . . Did you ever notice that when you blow in a dog's face, he gets pissed off with you, but when you take him on a car ride, he sticks his head out the window?
