This summer I will hit 22 and it is about time to start saving for my retirement.  With the little research I have been doing so far, there have been two main points driven into me:  Diversify your portfolio.  Have a 6-12 month cushion in liquid assets in case of emergency  Most households have less than a years worth of income in  total  wealth.  ( urlLink Actual values :  Income:  $42,148.  Wealth:  $40,200.)  How scary is that?
