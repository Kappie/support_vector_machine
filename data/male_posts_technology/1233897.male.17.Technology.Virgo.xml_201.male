For instance, if you wanted to browse www.yahoo.com in ... color ... (lol), you'd take the  http://www.malfunction.org/fulifier/nph-fulify.cgi?URL=  and add  yahoo.com  to form  http://www.malfunction.org/fulifier/nph-fulify.cgi?URL=yahoo.com   This seems to work for all html-based websites exept for a few notible ones (like  http://www.malfunction.org/fulifier/nph-fulify.cgi?URL=google.com ) that happen to have a different default language than http://www.malfunction.org/ 's and display the page in German among other things.
