They were going to leave after school, but they decided to leave at noon to try and make it through the pass before they were snowed in.   Attendance has been down since Monday on account of random illnesses. In Calc today, we had three people. (lol) I love that class even though I currently suck at it. I've been thinking that I need to be tutored in order to get out of the rut that I'm in in that class, but the more I contemplate it, I realize that I just need to take it more seriously. If I spent half the time on hw for it that I did on this computer... dang.  Btw, I'm going to try to start posting more regularly now: every day, and prolly will start using this for more of a personal itinerary blog and journal than a diary. Most of my old posts were me pouring my heart out and everything, but I've got way too many people checking this thing now to be safe using it for that LOL  'Ne wayz, Ben's coming over in a few, so I need to go give my room some attention. Adios~
