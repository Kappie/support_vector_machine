Karissa picked “Home on the Range”.  The movie was funny and Karissa even laughed when the audience laughed at stuff.  She is developing a sense of humor and hearing her laugh and stuff was good.  Grandma promised her macaroni and cheese for dinner so she was eager to get home.    I had to go to the store and Karissa did not want to go.  I asked her if she wanted to and she said no she was watching a care bear movie with grandma.  I started to leave to go to the store and Karissa asked me if I was coming back.  I said yes I was coming home and she said whose home?  “My home in WA or my home in TX?”  I did my best to assure her I was coming back to Grandma’s and she seemed worried but eventually let me go.  While Grandma was making mac and cheese, home made, Karissa and I played with the neighbor’s son Adam.  He has grown a lot since I saw him.  Karissa really likes Adam they ran around the yard her chasing him.  They had a really good time.    Seems like bedtime is a real issue for Karissa lately.  I am not sure why but she does not want to brush her teeth.  She won’t go to bed without someone there.  I had her going to bed without someone in the room and now she is back to needing someone.
