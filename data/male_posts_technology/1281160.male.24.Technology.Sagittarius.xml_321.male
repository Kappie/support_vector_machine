Hey, Sindhu, where are your photos? How did your b'day go? Hope you are not too busy to fill us in with the details...  Rini, I am collecting a few links related to CSS. I'll post them today. Go through them. The colour in the Group page seems not that nice.   Also could you ask those who have not yet responded to my reqauest for acknowledgement to reply asap.
