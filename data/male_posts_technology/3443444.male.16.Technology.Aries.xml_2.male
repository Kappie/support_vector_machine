I can't wait till tomorrow though, an actual poker tourny at Mitchell's house. should be quite the turn-out methinks.  Really, the only other thing going on is certian issues within the HP SIC....but thats strictly on a need-to-know basis only....and yes, I'm serious :D  I'm saddened due to the fact that my first post on my new blog got absolutly NO comments at all. I even sent out an e-mail to a lot of people telling them about it  ;_;    Well, I've got to do some homework.  Thats all I have to say about that.
