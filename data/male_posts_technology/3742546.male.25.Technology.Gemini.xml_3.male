Joe came over after dinner and we went to guitar center for some strings.  I have some pretty good news about the job hunt.  I actually got a call back a couple of days ago from the temp agency.  I have to go in for a group interview.  It's a governmental surveying job.  They're going to pay me what I'm asking for, but the job sounds kind of mind-numbing.  It'll be temporary through November though so I don't have to suffer indefinitely.  Hopefully it's not as boring as it sounds.  Until then, I'm going to keep sending out the resumes and working on my Settlers of Catan clone.      urlLink      urlLink      urlLink
