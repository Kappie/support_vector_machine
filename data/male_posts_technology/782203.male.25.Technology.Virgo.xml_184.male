Been thinking of the stuff that I am going to buy with my 1st paycheck.  CDs : 1. The Last Broadcast by Doves 2. Audioslave by Audioslave 3. Riot Act by Pearl Jam  Other Stuff: 1. Digital Camera (cheapo one ard 300 bucks ) 2. Those 3 in 1 printer/scanner/fax thingys. (400 bucks?)  3. Clothes for work 4. Guitar Lessons at Yamaha every weekend.  5. A Car 6. Powerpuff T-shirt and couple more shoes  Hmm probably not gonna have enuff to buy everything there (think i might have to postpone the car ) but we will see how. Show me the money EDB !!
