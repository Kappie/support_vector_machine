Pretty much the same as years before, but different people, and I am less involved than I used to be becuase I don't do the 4-H thing any more.  The fair board was able to book a carnival this year, which is pretty fun, except for a couple angry carnies that yelled at my friends and I for trying to get our money's worth at those stupid coin drop, pusher, prizes drop games.  Heh then going home trying to get out of the parking lot, I was just sitting in my parked car minding my own business when out of the blue, a telephone pole come flying through the lot and nearly takes off my side-view mirror.  Well...maybe it didn't happen exactly like that, but seriously, that chainsaw artist guy aught to teach to stupid poles a lesson ...
