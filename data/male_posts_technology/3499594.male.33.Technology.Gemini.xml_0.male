'The Patriot' to see the deep resevoir of honor and dignity, and see the comarade in the movie 'We were soldiers' with awe.   Yesterday during church the theme of course was Memorial Day and the willing soldiers sacrifices so that others may live in peace. But the true story of Love was that of God giving his only begotten son as a ransom for our sin. To give ones life is to give ultimate love. Of course many know the story of Christ's willingness to die for our sins, but I do not think many actually understand why or truly appreciate the depth. In the book of John we learn that Christ is the only means to God and that path is truly narrow. This fact alone is the sole difference of Christianity compared to any other religion on earth. The fact we as mere mortals cannot equate or work our way through those pearly gates, yet God Himself created a means for us to live eternally with Him.   The fact if you were caught in a crime and stood before a Judge, would you expect the judge to actually let you go without punishment? If the judge had, he would not be a fair judge. God is not only fair but he is pure. He could not let a sinner go unpunish any more than any fair judge. We know in James if you broken just one of the laws, your as guilty as breaking all of the laws. That alone should make us shudder. Especially considering the fact everyone has broken at least one of the laws, most likely all of them. So upon the day of judgment will you bear your sins upon yourself and suffer eternal punishment for them, or would you rather have a representive take the stripes for you? Christ has already paid that penalty upon the cross. All we have to do is ask for him to take our burden and sins asking Him to take control of our lives and He will. Simple really, but so hard for so many. Check it out in the bible.   So today I acknowledge all of those fallen soldiers willing to shed their lives and blood to make this Nation great. But I more so acknowledge the blood shed by Christ to make this world so so miniscule compared to the wonders of life eternal with Him.
