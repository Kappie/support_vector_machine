So I have been at the job for a year.  In December of 03, I signed on a yr lease for an apartment.  I also bought a car while working there.  I found out about this on January 8th of 2004.  I was not happy one bit.  It completely put a damper on my life.  Work sucked from that time on.  But we had more fun on the job than we did b4 we found out the closing.  All we had to do was stick it out and do a good job and not get fired.  If you got fired, you lost your severance bonus.  So January, February pass by and its now March.  Earthlink gave me a severance of about 1,900 and I was like awesome.  I got the check in the mail and was not pleased. I got only 1,200 of that.  700 of it went to taxes.  I could have really used that money.  Oh well.  Now its may and I have been living on unemployment for a few weeks.  I enjoy being unemployed but then again I hate it.  I need a job to pay the bills.  I am still looking and pursuing some leads.  I am looking into getting A+ certified.  So we shall see.
