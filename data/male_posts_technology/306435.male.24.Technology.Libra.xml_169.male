After weeks of price checking, I watched it arrive at my door through the handy dandy UPS web page.  Now my house is as wireless as it gets.  In fact, I am writing this on my couch as I watch Leo and the gang on The Screen Savers.   My second hockey game is tonight.  Hopefully the team can pull it together and get back to .500!!!
