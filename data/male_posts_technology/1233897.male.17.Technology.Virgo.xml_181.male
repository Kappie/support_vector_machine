Man, I've been running non-stop all week doing various things (most if not all of them fun), but have been getting very little sleep and am starting to lag behind on things that I had previously set as priorities.  On Wednesday night, our Senior Pastor was out of town, so  urlLink Pastor Bill Ritchie  from  urlLink Crossroads Community Church  came and gave a wonderful message. Man, that guy is funny. :) Probably one of the funniest this he did was call TBN the 'big hair channel'. (I'll post an audio clip of that later...) :-D He's really hard to record though; quite animated - constantly walking around the stage.  Chatting on Youthfire yesterday morning was interesting... Everyone was talking about butts from the time that I got on till a couple hours later... specifically Chelsea gawking about a pic of Phil's butt that Sam took... umm... yeah... next subject.  Youth group last night was cool, the majority of the Junior High was (is still) on an all-week campout, so it was just the 40-or-so of us Senior Highers. Everything was really impromptu. Steven and I randomly got up and led worship with Andrew (who played the guitar) then Ryan finished a series on a book title The Case For Christ. Was a pretty good book to read and study through. I'd recommend it to anyone.  Later after youth group was finished - about 9, I called Laurie again and talked to her for around ten minutes. It's kinda funny; I was running all over the place trying to help set up sound stuff for some people (Steven, Matt, Jeremy, Adam and Kelly) while talking to her. She had limited time to talk, so I handed her over to Steven after about ten minutes then they talked for... four or five minutes then he gave her back to me and we said goodbye. Haha, it was nice talking to her for more than 40 seconds this time. :)  Great "All-American" country song:    Keith Urban - Where The Blacktop Ends lyrics    Gonna kick off my shoes And run in bare feet Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends And feed my soul where the blacktop ends  I'm lookin' down the barrel of Friday night Ridin' on a river of freeway lights Goodbye city I'm country bound 'Til Monday rolls around  Gonna kick off my shoes And run in bare feet Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends And feed my soul where the blacktop ends  Workin' in the grind is an uphill road Punchin' that clock and carryin' that load I bust it all week and then I'm free The weekend belongs to me  Gonna kick off my shoes And run in bare feet Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends And feed my soul where the blacktop ends  Give me some fresh air give me that farm Give me some time with you in my arms Far away from the hustle and the pressure and the noise  Gonna kick off my shoes And run in bare feet Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends And feed my soul, you betcha  Gonna kick off my shoes And run in bare feet Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends And feed my soul where the blacktop ends  Where the blacktop ends Where the blacktop ends Where the blacktop ends
