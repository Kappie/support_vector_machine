Here is my 2 cents on the issue:  In the last City of Toronto election (last month), I filled out the traditional paper ballot where you "fill-in" a line next to the candidate you select. But what I really liked about their technique is that you, the voter, had to run it through a scanner before you were allowed to leave. If the machine couldn't read your vote... well, I don't know what they would do but I assume they would give you a new ballot and destroy the old one. Basically, there will never be spoiled ballots. Of course, the machine didn't tell the operator who the vote was for. And if an election was close in a particular riding, the ballots can still be hand counted.  When the election was over, we had the official results in less than 30 minutes. For a city of 3 million people, not too bad.
