     
      You head out from the hotel, a small knot of celestials out to do good (or evil) as their natures demand.  You make your way quickly over to River and down the way to where 1024 would be.  As you get closer, you can see a large and somewhat sinister looking power plant lurking darkly on an embankment over the river.  Power lines run out of the plant in all directions like a steel spiderweb.  As the city starts to peter out you reach a gated area with a sign.  The gate hangs open, and the sign reads "Electrimass, 1024 River Street".  A rusted sign on the fence reads "Keep Out, No Tresspass."  A gravel drive winds up toward the plant building, lined on either side by tall trees and bushes in a very wild state.  It's just before dawn.
