I will focus on what I saw and on what I heard about the show.   Okay, from what I can figure out, the first segment of the night was HHH gloating about his actions last week. Back to basics, I see. *sign*   The only good part of this was that Eric Bischoff comes out and announces a 60 minute Iron Man Match with Benoit vs. HHH next RAW. Cool !!! That is something I am sure not to miss. What? Is Smackdown pulling a PPV this Sunday? Why such a high profile match? Anyway, I won't complain. Bring it on, baby !!!   Another thing I liked was reading that William Regal ran down, stick up for Eugene, and fought his way to the ring until (*sign*) he was arrest by security. If I had a nickel for every superstar that was arrested this was in the WWE...   Same shit, different program.   Okay, here is where I came in to watch the program (yes, HHH talking for a 1/2 was the start of the program... when will the WWE learn). First match of the night was Grenier vs. Tajiri. Good match. At least it was entertaining. I am a big fan of Tajiri and it's great seeing him back.   Next up was Chris Jericho's Highlight Reel. Who were the guest? The 10  finalists from the Diva Search. Fuck !!! I don't want to see this shit. If I want half naked women, I'll turn to the internet, thank you very much!!! This is most definitely a failed experiment for the WWE. Proof of this was the reaction of the crowd. They didn't give a fuck. This is so stupid. This segment sucks. Jericho tells them to trash Eric's office to find an "immunity envelope". The girls destroy the office. What's the point? Then Jericho slips out, leaving the girls to face an enrages Eric Bischoff. Yep, Eric bitched, screamed and threatened the girls. I am sure the WWE thinks that we watch wrestling to watch men be mean to women. Here, something like that would have gotten Eric beaten up. Try screaming crap at ten Latino women. Hell, you'll be lucky if you survive with your testicles intact.   Anyway, bad and extremely, pointless segment that did shit for everyone involved. Question, wouldn't tricking women to do vandalism, then slipping out to avoid capture so you can leave the women to face the wrath constitute an act of extreme evil? Yep, Jericho is such a good guy !!! The thing is that Jericho escapes without heat because people are too busy hating the diva contestants. Erm... Is that what you wanted, WWE?   Next we have Tyson Tomko vs. Hurricane. Hurricane needs to get a new agent. At least now Stacy is with him, but is this really going to help him? I saw, send him to Smackdown and have him wrestler Chavo Guerrero or Rey Mysterio. Maybe he can even turn heel. Super hero becomes super villain. That would be great. Oh, and Tomko wins. Like there was any doubt.   Tomko and Trish beat up on the Hurricane, but in comes the new Rosie (as in new gimmick) for a rescue. Apparently, judging by his new costume, he is no longer the Super-hero-in-training (SHIT), but a full fledged super hero. Riiiiiiiiight...   Lets more on...   Batista vs. Chris Benoit.   Interesting match with Batista actually dominating Benoit. Huh? What?   Hey, it's Batista's home town. Feel the love. People are actually digging Batista. Also, he has improved. I think that if the WWE plays it's cards right, we could have another Brock Lesnar. Even thought what made Brock was having Paul Heyman as a manager. Damn, he's good.   Anyway, watch Batista continues to improve each week. Don't know how this helps Benoit, but at least next week he will be in the Ironman Match with HHH which I am eager to see.   From here on, I was no longer able to watch the program. So, from what I hear...   Next, it was Kane vs. Chris Jericho. Of course, Eric made this match to get even with what he made the Divas do to his office. Sounded like a crappy match. These two don't mix well in the ring. Bad feud. Hey, what happend to Lita and her baby???   The main event was Edge vs. Randy Orton for the IC title. These guys are clicking in the ring. I am looking forward to their SummerSlam rematch. Sounds like this match was pretty good. This is very positive. I like both these guys (obviously, Edge more than Orton, but Orton is relatively new compared to Edge).   It's funny how much the Evolution stable has helped Orton and Batista. Both these guys have improved because of it. Also, because they realized that even if a push was handed to you on a silver plate, you still had to work to keep it.   Show sounded pretty good, except for the 1/2 of HHH talking and the 1/2 devoted to the stupid Diva Search Contest.   Wait? Does that mean that we got a show that was one hour of shit and then one hour of good to mediocre wrestling? Sorry, I detract what I said about the show being good. Damn!   I wasn't going to put a rating up, but given the fact that more than 1/2 the show was crap, I believe this would get a D- in my book.   Well, that's that. See ya next Tuesday.     urlLink Sailor Ecchi
