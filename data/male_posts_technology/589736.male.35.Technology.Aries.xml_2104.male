The wind  	carries it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it about  	violently, or, without warning, sending it soaring skyward,  	then letting it float gracefully down to the ground...  					  LESTER (V.O.) 			I guess I could be pretty pissed  			of f about what happened to me...  			but it's hard to stay mad, when  			there's so much beauty in the  			world. Sometimes I feel like I'm  			seeing it all at once, and it's too  			much, my heart fills up like a  			balloon that's about to burst...  	EXT. SKY - DAY  	LESTER continues to FLY above the clouds, LAUGHING.  					  LESTER (V.O.) 			And then I remember to relax, and  			stop trying to hold on to it, and  			then it flows through me like rain  			and I can't feel anything but  			gratitude for every single moment  			of my stupid little life...  	He's SOARING higher and higher...  					  LESTER (V.O.) (cont'd) 			You have no idea what I'm talking  			about, I'm sure... but don't  			worry...  	And He SOARS out OF sight.  					  LESTER (V.O.) (cont'd) 			You will someday.  	FADE to BLACK.
