Has too many flaws to keep it from being really, really good, but the actors and the sympathetic lead characters manages to make up for it most of the time. Especially the female lead,  urlLink Ha-Neul Kim , with her ordinary yet still extremely appealing cute looks. She was also in  urlLink Don't Believe Her  (another 3.5 Korean romantic comedy) that I saw about a month ago. Apparently she was also in  urlLink Ditto  (3.5 Korean romantic drama) that I saw about two months ago, but I don't remember her in that one, pun intended. Don't get it? Follow the link and see the alternative english title... Quality humor at it's best... ehh... well maybe not :-). -->
