It's an RSSfeed reader with an interface very much like Outlook 2003. Hey, nothing special there right? RSS Readers are all over the place these days. (SharpReader, NewsGator, RSS Bandit...) Sauce Reader has a sharp and easy to use UI.   But you can also  post to your weblogs  from within the tool. Like I am doing right nowto my Blogger blog. Like I was able to do  at my other (dasBlog) blog .   It's  integrated with MSN Messenger  too, although I'm not into that so I haven't tried it.   This is a professional quality software product, and it's free. Unbelievable.
