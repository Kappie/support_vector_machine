The scariest part - it seems to indicate that mismanagement of state-acquired farms for the purpose of redistribution, is nothing new.  "The half-farm Westfalen (next to Uhlenhorst) was bought nine years ago and demonstrates how taxpayers' money and investment capital are wasted.  The Government bought this farm of approximately one thousand hectares with seventeen thousand citrus trees for N$ 1.67 million since the previous owner annually harvested between 40,000 and 46,000 bags of 5kg oranges each.  Mismanagement by now has 1 000 trees surviving."  Scary.  Props to Clem.
