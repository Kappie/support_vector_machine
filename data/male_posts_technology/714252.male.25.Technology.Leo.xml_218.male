Happy random boner day to one and all, I am trying to keep a count of how many times I get a boner today for some reason.. Not quite sure why.. So far I am up to 4 (I know, I'm pretty disapointed so far myself.. Maybe I'm thinking about it too much)   Also looking forward to Salsa today :) I wants to gets my dance on :)   Gordon is back in the country! Wh0ot! Missed you big guy..   Ehm.. Grass is Green.   OK, Sorry, random thoughts spewing from my mind onto the keyboard, not very focused, good mood making strange blogs etc.   Stopping now,   Really I am.   STOP.   hehehe
