I have been working on a special project for a group that I once tried to get a job for. I didn't realize until now that the job is so much more fun than what I am currently doing right now. I mean, come on, fixing problems over the phone and going to user's desks isn't the idea of fun. Users are a weird animal. Some of them possess no patience whatsoever. Not that I expect them to anyways. The real question is, would I be that way to other technicians if they came over to my desk? A rather hard question to answer.   In a complete change of topic, I recently (and I mean about three weeks ago) had one a most entertaining realization. I was thinking about high school (don't know why), and it dawned on me that I had many friends that were girls. I was always polite and nice to the opposite side of the sex, no matter what their race, creed, religion, etc. but it was not until recently that I realized that most of those girls were very physical in the ways they would communicate with me. Some would hug me just to say "Good Morning!" or some would touch my arm as I made an ass of myself (which I frequently did, both purposely and accidently, in high school) for their amusement. Now, if I were to take you back to my mindset back in high school, I could only tell you two things I was majorly interested in and completely enamored with. Videogames and computers. That's all. Nothing else.   The sudden realization came when I thought "wow, some of those girls were pretty good looking..." and BAM! It hit me like a side of salty lemonade across a bloody open cut: THEY WERE INTERESTED IN ME!!!  If you looked at me now (or at least knew me now), you'd be laughing, but I must admit I, at the VERY least, looked clean back then. THAT was a rarity as most boys my age back then did not shower nor knew the meaning of the word "soap." Neanderthals....  Then I realized something else. If I knew then, what I know now about girls...suffice it to say, I would've been a different person than I am now. I DO NOT regret this...AT ALL. Most high school relationships are immature at best and end worse than they began....but just thinking about it is really mind-boggling.   It's like you find that part in a videogame where you choose two paths. One can take you to an entirely different ending and another can make your main character someone no one likes at all, thereby leading you to an ending where your main characters dies in some fashion.   I have to repeat myself though (for the sake of Liz-Ann, who will read this). I DO NOT REGRET THIS INACTION AT ALL. It's fascinating to think about it, but I do not wish to go back to that period in my life and take advantage of all of their advances.   Nope, I already have the right one for me. I'm perfectly content and truthfully, I would have it no other way :)
