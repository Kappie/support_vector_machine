Big deal, cept' my wife and daughter would freak.  I couldn't find him, although I did walk around the house a couple times looking for him.  Dumb cat.  Anyway I went to bed and woke up in the middle of the night (for no reason).  I got up and went to the door and the cat was waiting to get in.  Thank god.  everything is good so far...  We finally got our home equity loan financing worked out.  My wife is out of town and the brilliant people at Wells Fargo seem to think I cannot use a Power of Attorney to get the papers signed.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.  We'll sign them Monday when we're together.  Thank god that's done.  I'm working on my Mom's medicaid papers.  Apparently Fairfax county lost the originals I sent them.  So now if have to redo all the work.  Of course, I didn't make a copy so I'm screwed regarding the original documents I sent them.    I'm having difficulty getting my car repaired after an accident on May 21.  Can't get ahold of the insurance company responsible for fixing my vehicle.  Another saga in my life.  I can't wait to go to the beach, get drunk and build sand castles next week.  Tonight I played golf with my neighbor David and had a great time.  It's nice to be with friends.  I played not well in the beginning.  On my second shot I hit a car driving near the fairway.  Oooops!  I then proceeded to squander my game until Number 9 where I hit a 200+ drive and then hit the green on my second shot.  I lipped the put from about 20 and tapped in for par.  That's what keeps you coming back.  It's warm in the house...Remember I turned off the AC.  Sweat, sweat, sweat!!!  I had a big salad and a tuna sandwich for dinner.  Not too bad health wise.  I could have skipped the bread though.  That no carb thing is for the birds.  I've gotta clean the house before I go to the beach.  So much for tonight.  See ya tomorrow.
