I'm getting old and soft and it bothers me I can't be more active and do the things I used to do. I've noticed an increase of about 10-15 pounds in the past 2-1/2 years and it's not becasue I'm eating more. Others say I look good with the added weight because I was too thin before. That's all I have to say about any of that...at least for now.
