Pheedo reports that by integrating online advertising into an RSS feed, a new online advertising technique, it has achieved measurably better results than e-mail for its client.   The online campaign for a free IT evaluation was conducted through specialist publication InfoWorld, which could offer direct access to IT professionals.   Pheedo said the six-week effort outperformed the best click through rate in email by over 26% as compared to the industry average of 8.7% CTR reported in DoubleClickâ€™s Q4 2003 Email Trend Report. Furthermore, they were able to lower the effective CPM by three times of that over email, saving its client thousands of dollars.   Writing this, I thought about Google AdSense - did someone one integrate Google Adsense in RSS feeds? The answer is YES. Enough smart people around. But its against google license policy and therefore has been put off.  urlLink [Mehack]   And now yet, another activity -  urlLink BlogAds . Some items from BlogAds FAQ   What are Blogads? Glad you asked that. Blogads are classified ads that appear in blogs and other independent web sites. Each "strip" of Blogads is managed by an independent publisher who sets prices and decides which ads appear.  Thank you. Who gets the cash from Blogads? In traditional media, writers and editors earn less than 20% of total revenues, and 80% of revenues go to newsprint, ink, new computers for the ad reps, parking spots, printing presses, lemonade for the publisher's kids... you get the picture. The coin gets flipped with Blogads: 80% goes to the writer, with 20% paying for technology   Will we see publishers now publishing 10 items in every feed which contain nothing but ads? RSS atleast has a big plus that one can remove it quite easily from his reader. So publishers have to be extra careful that they don't publish feeds which cause a nuisance. What will it be for users? Only time will tell, how mainstream this activity becomes. Right now it looks to be going strong!
