She'd been in the hospital since New Year's and seemed like she was getting "better" but took a turn for the worse the other day. I said "better" because the infection had caused her kidney's to shut down, among doing other damage, so even if she had recovered, her life would have been dramatically different from that point forward.  It was her decision to agree to exploratory surgery in an attempt to help her late Tuesday night. The doctor's said it was very possible nothing could be done and that she wouldn't recover from it, but she agreed anyway. She was a strong woman and too proud to let the infection defeat her so she took her chances. I'm sad but happy for her because ultimately, its better for her this way. My grandmother would have been the first to say that, and the whole family agrees.  However, all she originally went in for was foot surgery, so what I don't get is why do bad things happen to good people?  Visitation is today and her funeral is this Saturday.  I'm going to miss her.
