Although it is REALLY long. Anyway, that Andy guy could really sum things up. I have been thinking about my Poker playing lately. I think I am being a little hard on myself. I mean lets get real. I have been playing for about two months. Of course I have an inflated opinion of myself.   As I nursed my $50 up to $500 I thought "I cannot lose", "I am the best poker player of my generation". Ha! What it really says is I am a young poker player. Sometimes I am on my game, sometimes not so much. I am prone to making mistakes, and even one big mistake can kill you in a ring game or tourney.   It is nice to get back to earth. I hope to keep improving my game. I hope to get used to variance. Everyone gets it. Just because I did not see much of it on my rise (ha!), does not mean I am not going to have off times. So anyway, I need to keep playing, and keep trying to manage my money correctly.  One bad thing about internet Poker is it feeds my personality way to much. I was always that nerd kid, playing games in his dark basement for hour-upon-hour, Doom, Quake, Half Life, Warcraft! I would spend hours playing these games, literaly until my hand cramped up and I had to stop. Not sure what void I am trying to fill here, but that is another Blog. I think online poker has the same draw as video games. The money does not seem real. Need to play until I beat the game. Just a thought. It is kind of funny how Poker really makes you think about yourself, and the inner workings of people in general. Dr Freud signing off.
