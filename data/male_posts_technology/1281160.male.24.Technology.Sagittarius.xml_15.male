It was a pleasant weekend... what else could be a trip to home... couldn't see any of our friends there... but called on almost whoever is possible to be called...  R Sindhu asked to convey her very BIG wishes to rini and also added that she's angry for not receiving mails for quite sometime...   Others whoever I called asked me to convey my regards to everyone here... I talked to jax also over phone...   Apart from calling on people I slept, slept and saw TV ... so thatï¿½s about my calm weekend. My April's quota of visit home might be in mid-April...   Kicha
