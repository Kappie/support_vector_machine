I had a sense of impending doom that is always hard to shake. Since I'm a little paranoid and I tend to overanayize things. I just hope this feeling of dread in the back of my head goes away soon otherwise it will really start to get on my nerves. In other news I did really well this semseter, and I am going to start the job hunt on monday anew.
