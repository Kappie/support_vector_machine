I played one of the  Storm of Chaos  events at my local gaming store and after worrying about the Bretonnian charge, which promptly wiped out a vast quantity of my army.  My Chaos Knights joined in the fray and fear overwelmed the enemies as they ran before my advance.  When they did hit my knights, they kinda.... bounced off.  My nasty hell cannon made all his archers run off the board, but then ate it's crew.... went very slowly and couldn't get anywhere.  My first victory!!! Mwahahahaha!  It came down to the scenario victory points and i won.     Anywho, back to work, no more play...
