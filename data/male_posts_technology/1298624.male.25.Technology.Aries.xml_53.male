I must apologize though since this hasn't been updated in such a long time. Now, without further ado, let my rant materialize and rue upon the world chaos unchallenged and mitigate sorrow amongst ALL upon its wake!!! (not even Star Wars can get more epic than that).   I'm amazed at the vast knowledge of theatre my parents have acquired. As a reference to threatre, I am referring to the movies. Dare I say that they know more so of the subject than I do...and that's saying a lot (and also coming off quite condescending, but nevertheless true). They watch more movies now than ever before. It's not a bad thing of course. I enjoy a good movie every once and awhile, but I find there are more interesting things to do when in front of any sort of screen (such as what I am doing right now).   I'm not a big fan of TV. I usually never watch it unless I have nothing to do (which is someting that rarely ever happens). I find that I enjoy TV just when I'm about to go to sleep. My mind is hinging itself among the last vestiges of coherent thought, so I figure most of the crap of TV wouldn't affect me as I slowly vegetate and settle my mind in for the primal (carnal, or not) urge to fall deep into the slumber that my body requires. Disconnecting my mind from reality is a very hard thing to do. It's almost like you have to fool your mind into thinking that it needs sleep, so you coerce it with an apparent lack of cognitive realization of what's going on around you (i.e. closing your eyes) and attempt to figure out what those purple/green spots are and why they float around (which I have figured out after much research).  Specifically, when you close your eyes, I'm not saying this is for everyone, but you either see a purple/green spot floating around your otherwise pitch black vision or red/yellow spots doing the same thing. It's amazing because if you look hard enough, you'll start to see that the purple/geen (or red/yellow spots) start to show a fluid moving downward in the background. It almost looks like a cascading waterfall in pitch black darkness. This falling fluid, of course, is what keeps your eyes moist during operation...but the combination of that with the backside of your eyelid causes these wonderous colors to appear. It's almost as if you combine soap with something in the air to make a rainbow (I have yet to remember how that happens actually, at least I know there isn't a pot of gold on the other side).   I seem to remember wanting to rant about something else, but now I don't remember what. I guess I should end this with the fact that not everything in your life can be planned. Somethings just jump out at you and bite you in the ass.
