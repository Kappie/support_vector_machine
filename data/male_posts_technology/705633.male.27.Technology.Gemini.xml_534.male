Can I add that these have to be the worse five questions I have ever been asked! They are even worse than the age old problem causing question "Elephant impression? I'd like to see that?"  1) How would you finish this phrase "I have never been so embarassed as the time when......."? Umm, Like, Urgh? How often have I been embarrassed? Possibly when my stepdad walked in on me when my girlfriend was sitting on my lap… us both butt naked, doing the dirty, bouncing up and down, sitting on the end of my brothers bed, facing the door!  2) If you could have any job in the world what would it be? Porn star interviewer. I would test female porn stars on there... Acting Abilities?   3) What do you like best about each guy on toaster files? They are all my good friends, which mean a lot. But a single point for each person is noted Toaster – wicked sense of humour, really appeals to me in its apparent complexity. Baity – so easily wound up. Custard – Oh how I don’t know anyone else who could be more of a tart when they put their mind to it. Psycho Alex – He is not one but many. He doesn’t have so much as mood swings but like Worzle Gummage, he has a different body for different attitudes. Danger and Dougal. Well… They know me and I know them. Longer than anyone else in the TF. Besides we used to shower together. Captain Kirk – I don’t really know Kirk that well… but he can drink and everyone else likes him, so he’s cool by me.   4) If you could have anyone as your lover who would it be? A female version of me. Only I would be as dirty, kinky and adventurous as myself. I would be able to chat to myself afterwards and I would know instinctively how to please me. Oh and I would have perfect breasts!  5) What is your absolute favorite meal of all time? To refrain from sex and keep to food (as if I could draw a distinction). Something cooked by someone else. Risotto, Gristy stile. Anything by Nanny Ogg. (bananna surprise!) I would like to try Spoo but I don’t think many people would understand.
