She struggled for so long to make sure Whitney had the proper education and safety of our city, she would hate to lose all of that now.  Her Mobile Home is demolished. Water pipes burst and everything is ruined.  Kitchen is gone, Living Room is gone. 90% of Dianna's clothes gone. Whitney's bed and dresser gone. They have salvaged what they could - but have to start over.  I don't know what they will do with the Mobile Home as it is.  Meanwhile we need to replace some of the necessary things.  Whitneys computer [someone gave it to her] was destroyed.  The fund at Community Plus Savings is still active if anyone wants to donate. We have obtained legal council [donated] for Dianna just in case the park wants to get nasty with her. Dianna is making a list of everything that was destroyed and we will post it here when we receive it.  Please help out our fellow residents! Additional info  urlLink Click Here
