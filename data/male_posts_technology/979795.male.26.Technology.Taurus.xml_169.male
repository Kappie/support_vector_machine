I enjoyed the experience of going on a tour with Daniel and Justin. Most often they took the lead on the planning, suggested places of interests, etc.  Learned a little something planning and budgeting my finances. I had to ensure that I bring MORE THAN ENOUGH money whenever I'm on a trip.  Safety was essential. Especially safety with respects to your own luggage was not to be taken for granted. Regardless of how   suagu   it'd make us look, there's simply no compromise because as tourists, we stand out too easily.  Hope someday, I can go on another trip like this with the guys.
