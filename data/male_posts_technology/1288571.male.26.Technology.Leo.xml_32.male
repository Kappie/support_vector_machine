Anyways, the place where I work opened up a new office about 8 months ago about 10 minutes from head office (by car).  Anyways during that time, there's been a ton of car thefts, and 2 of them most recently.. get a load of this part of the notice everyone was sent..  "There have been two recent incidents of auto theft at the 50 Westmount Place parking lot. Waterloo Regional Police say our Waterloo office locations aren't problem areas for theft and "very few things go missing from this area"  uh.. they "aren't problem areas for theft" eh? then how come so many cars have been broken into in the past 8 months?  I think they're full of shit personally.
