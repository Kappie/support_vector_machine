We did lots of loafing, guitar playing, fishing (worm and fake worm drowning), hot tubbing, Password playing, beer and coffee drinking, grilling, red-meat and ice cream eating, swimming, exploring, and arson.     We did some boating, told jokes about boating, and about people who own boats. We made our somewhat annual trip to the drive-in, which is always fun.  Spiderman 2  was a hit.   White Chicks  was, well,  White Chicks .   Gock and I tried to burn down the cabin and surrounding area with our hillbilly pyrotechnics. Thanks go to Gock and Melanie for braving  "One Armed Willie's"  to purchase the implements of destruction.    The cabin was  outstanding . Thanks to Koala for securing it; we hope to have it again next year. It was borderline luxurious: The hot tub was a big hit, the amenities were unbelievable, and there was lots of land to roam around on.
