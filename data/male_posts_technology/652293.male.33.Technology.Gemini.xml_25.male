An ADN  urlLink article  on how G-Murkowski wants to take hundreds of millions per year from the fund to pay for the things the State of Alaska should be able to pay for anyway.  It's called a budget.  You live within your means.  Why is it that when people don't pay their bills, collection agencies get on your ass?  But when the government doesn't pay it's bills, it gets to keep running anyway.  I wish I could do that.  Just keep spending even though I don't have any money.
