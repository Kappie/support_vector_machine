I paused in my hobbling toward the door in hopes that she would win her imagined argument and vacate. No such luck, in fact the dispute became more animated as the seemingly irrational, yet also phantasmal, Isabella joined the fray. After a few minutes of enduring this altercation I got fed up and attempted to step around her and out the door. Bad move. I suddenly became the embodiment of the aforementioned Dimitri and she began swearing and swinging her gargantuan purse at me. I was taken aback by this gratuitous display of insanity and tried to lurch out the door and out of range of her surprisingly feisty onslaught. Sadly due to my left leg  lameness I wasn't able to outdistance her and she continued to rain blow after blow into my head and neck.       There is very little that is more humiliating for a 6'6" 230lb man then getting his ass walloped by a 94 year old, 94 pound, wizened old woman. Especially so when it happens at the corner of 4th and Vine in Vancouver in the presence of at least thirty of the beautiful women that Kits is famous for.      When I finally managed to elude this tiny hellcat from the land of Crazy she began spitting and yelled a curse at me. Something along the lines of "Curse you Dimitri, I curse you. May a dark cloud of crapulence follow you everywhere!!" I considered myself lucky to escape even with my pride so completely demolished.       Then I headed back to the Ultimate field to discover that, miraculously, Swarm was leading 5-1. I sat down to watch the inevitable first victory of the Division 1 Swarm. But somehow a dark cloud of crapulence descended and we went on to lose 10-6. Then we continued on to the second game and somehow a darker cloud of crapulence descended and decided to drop water upon our heads, and further, caused our fair-weather-only team to lose the second game as well.       So, I apologize. I should never have brought my curse down upon Swarm's fair head. Great effort! Everyone played spectacularly but, as mentioned, the curse doomed you to lose. I apologize again. I have to go now as all the plants in our home appear to have spontaneously died and begun decomposing pungently, drawing all the neighbourhood rodents.       Score Peon Out.
