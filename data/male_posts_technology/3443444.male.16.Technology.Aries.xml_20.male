So, she's buying front row wrestling tickets for my brother, so she decided to get me an object of my choice. I chose a nice ass MP3 player, after some quick research, I chose the iRiver iHP-120 20GB MP3 player:   It has a 20 GB hard drive, which is about 10 times the amount of music I actually have, but luckily, since iRiver doesn't suck, it can be used as an external hard drive, a voice recorder, and it has the ability to record from any outside source. So I found it to be quite a useful device. Since I only have under 2 gigs of songs, I decided to go prowl some message boards asking for reccomendations to fill my new, expensive toy. Well, on one board, known as LUE which is notorious for its bad behavior all over the GameFAQ's message boards, I had 29 people in 5 minutes telling me how iPods are better than my iRiver in every way possible, which sadly, it is not. I even had one person tell me that all iRivers suck and iPods are so much better, and threw in the fact that hes  not  a fanboy, because he owns a   Dell DJ!   Now, I must say that Dell DJ's suck a rather significant amount of ass, and no, this isn't coming from a potential future HP employee, its coming from somebody who knows a little something about technology.  If one of my faithful readers wouldn't mind too much, please, either make a comment, or e-mail me sending me a nice big list of some good songs that you know of. It'd be greatly appreciated.
