Its from my trip back hom last week to be present at the funeral for my aunt. urlLink Anymoo photos :: r317 :: Holland Hopping   She had passed away during a terrible hiking accident in the southn of spain. They were going to make a 1.5 hr hike up to a mountain hut in good weather, but then the weather turned for the worse and they got lost. some 10 hours later the group minus 2 reached the hut. They had to leave my aunt behind on the mountain side where she passed away due to hypothermia.  So anyway..  my mom arranged for me to be able to go to the funeral where I got to carry the coffin. All in all the ceremony was very good and quite emotional. Afterwards everyone went to a cafe for some coffee and cake and some other drinks.  Since there was a  urlLink Jazz festival  in Enkhuizen, we decided to hang out for a while and listen to some fine jazz music before heading back. The music was good and the beer was cold. All enjoyed with some nice rays of sunshine and a side of "patat met".  Eventually we made our way back to the train station and ride the train back to Hoorn.
