So Kerry donned a funny looking suit so he could do some stuff with NASA... so what? Where do I sign up? I've always wanted to wear funny looking suits for NASA. Not that the Kerry campaign is any less guilty of this tactic. I hate it all around. I don't care that Jenna Bush stuck her tounge out at the reporters or that Dubya fell off his bike again. Why is this important enough to make front page news on a major news outlet? I wonder why they don't attack each other where it really matters: the issues. Oh yeah, that's right, there's absolutely no difference between Bush policy and Kerry policy. Argh! I can't believe what this election year has boiled down to. If Bush wasn't such an evil bastard, I wouldn't even vote.
