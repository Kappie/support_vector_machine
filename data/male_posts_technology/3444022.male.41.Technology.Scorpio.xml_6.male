Now she's not complaining (although she isn't doing much there either).  After sitting on the potty for about 5 minutes, with the reading materials provided by Mom (against Dad's better judgement) - Rita got up, strolled to the living room and... successfully emptied her bladder on the carpet.  Yesterday Rita managed to successfully put the basketball through the hoop, before she would only touch it under the hoop.  Now she's a full fledged basketball star!
