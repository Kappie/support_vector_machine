The new forum  urlLink is set up  I didn't like proboards and the new one looks MUCH friendlier. I don't want to move all 1400 posts, I dont have any energy and I did not sleep well last night. I have to crash by 11 usually but I end up staring at my ceiling for 3 hours... I am exhausted when I wake up and I have a whole 10 minutes to get ready.  Then I get tired after lunch because of some retarded history project or someone being an ass.  Elad's Hub ver 2.1 is coming up. I still have to finalize it and buy my domain.  I hopefully will own eladnet.com and run my webcomic, adventures, and all my awesome-ness thru there.  For some reason I am real anxious to move, I want to get away and be alone for a while. I am constantly working on something and I just want to relax and work on my site for all you folks. Html is like a zen garden and Tyler above all is the perfect place to use that zen garden.  pWnD is helping me out with the forum, we got 9 members to sign up from the last forum and have 100 posts the first day. Charles is getting all bitchy because he thought all the old post were gone, but you can still  urlLink view  them.  My cool site of the day-  urlLink The ShyGuy kingdom  So many sprites my face is going to fall off.
