Will blog about her someday.)      Attended TIME classes this morning after a gap of a week. Seems, the classes were held everyday this week. I have never missed 2 classes in a row before. Neway, nuthing much happened during my absence.       Was lazy this morning after the class. Never in the mood to start to office. A good discussion on Indian Cricket is happening among Arvind, Sri and Me. We used to have many such discussions when in College. We used to commute in the now gone sub urban trains daily. It was fun. I still remember a debate in the class on "Shud culture be preserved ?" It was one hot debate betwenn Sri and Arvind and we really enjoyed. Sri do u remember ???      Just realised that it is 1 PM and time for lunch. Planning to do some meaningful work in the post lunch session.      Got my hands on a copy of "Katradhum Petradhum" by Sujatha. Planning to finish that this weekend along with "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest".
