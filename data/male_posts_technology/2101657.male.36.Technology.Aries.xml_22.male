Here's the write-up on the back of the boxed set out now on DVD:  "Five hundred years in the future there's a whole new frontier, and the crew of the Firely-class spaceship  Serenity  is eager to stake a claim on the action. They'll take any job, legal or illegal, to keep fuel in the tanks and food on the table. But things get a bit more complicated after tthey take on a passenger wanted by the new totalitarian Alliance regime. Now they find themselves on the run, desperate to steer clear of Alliance ships and the flesh-eatting Reavers who live on the fringes of space."  Some of the ways they did things on this show REALLY made me wonder why Star Trek:Enterprise can't be more like this show?  You had a cast of 9 characters, who almost always interacted together for every episode they aired.  Mal is the Captain, Zoe is the XO, Wash (Zoe's hubby) is the pilot, Jayne the mentally-off musle of the group, Simon (doctor), and his sister River (hunted both by the Alliance), Kailee the ships mechanic, Book, a preacher (who has a much hinted at past that he was a high member of the Alliance), and Inara, who is a licensed Companion (space age high class call girl).  This show gelled from the get-go.  They just mesh perfectly and it's a joy to watch if you like SCI-FI.  They most high tech thing about the time period is they have space travel, advanced medical technology, but for weapson, hand-held anyway, they are stuck with projectile weapons (bulllets). It has a high "old west" feel to it.  The intro song is pretty catchy too, and is actually written by Joss Whedon the creater of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer".  On the 4th dvd they include his playing/singing of it to the studio to give them an idea of what he thought it should be like.  They left it intack, but spiced up the tempo.   The set is going for $39.99. If your a fan on the show, thats very reasonable, as you get the entire series on 1 set of DVDs.  Sounds like the sales of the set are doing very well, so if we get lucky, maybe the studio will bring the show back due to sales.  There is also rumor going around that Firefly is already making the transistion to the BIG screen already. If that's the case and is true, I can't wait to see Serenity flying across the screen.
