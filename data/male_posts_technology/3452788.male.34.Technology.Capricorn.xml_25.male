She was with a group of people, some paying attention to the game, others just blabbing and drinking.  I cannot fucking stand people like her who just blah, blah, blah simply for the sake of hearing her own idiotic voice.  The more she drank, the louder she got, flopping on me a few times, almost spilling her beer on me and my kids, yelling at people walking by (hey, I looove you, call me), and oh yeah, once in a while said Go Crabs.  The dumb bitch probably does not know a fucking thing about baseball, she was just there to drink cheap beer.  The only thing worse than "cool" people are "cool" people who interfere with my enjoyment of a ball game.
