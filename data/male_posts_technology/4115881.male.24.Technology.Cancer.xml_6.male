I'm sure one day Bret will read this and laugh, but I just got word that he is taking the job that Russell left when he up and moved to Qatar to work at A's branch campus there.  Bret will start working here on August 25th, which will be a very good day now.  I think that's all I need to write today.  Adios, Eric
