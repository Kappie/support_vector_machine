 -The Boondock Saints   I spent Father's Day on the beach in Harrison Hot Springs with Lydia  Ash (my wife and son).  We were on the quiet side of the beach, but there were 30 or so other people nearby.  While we were enjoying the sunshine and eating some fries, Lydia says "That guy over there is drowning!".  I looked out onto the lake and saw nothing out of the ordinary. "I am sure everything is fine", I replied. I thought to myself that someone else would have already jumped in to save anyone in trouble.  It turns out I was wrong.  Lydia pointed him out to me a second or two later.  There was a guy out in the lake splashing frantically and disappearing under the water for 10 seconds.  I ran down to the water and swam out to him.  He grabbed on to my back and I helped him get to safety.  He coughed out a bit of water, said "thanks", and was on his way.  Then I sat back down with my family.  After I had a minute to gather my thoughts, I looked around the beach.  There were many people that were close enough to him to have heard him yell help and go out to him.  A lot of people sat there while he was drowning and just watched him.  From what Lydia saw, all of the people at the beach were perfectly willing to let the guy drown right in front of them.  I don't know where that kind of attitude comes from, but it is a very sad demonstration of the state of the world.  I sure hope that the day Lydia or Ash is in trouble and I am not there, someone will be there to help them.
