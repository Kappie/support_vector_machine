My dad will be getting back today from Reading, Pennsylvania. He works there every other week. We'll all be heading out for an eight day cruise in the southern carribean. We'll leave out of San Juan and go to many wonderfully relaxing places. I'm pretty excited as we'll be on the biggest cruise ship in the world right now. The Adventure of the seas is the flagship of the Royal Carribean line. I'll be out for nine days so I won't update here for awhile. The main thing I'll miss is my job as a 3D Modeller for a modification of Command and Conquer: Generals Zero Hour. The site that hosts it is www.cncgeneralsworld.com and they are a great fansite. I'm staff there and I'm also the lead modeller for the All-Stars mod. It's alot of fun and I enjoy modelling and talking with all of these great guys. Unfortunately there can be some stupid stuff in the main public forums so I stick to the staff forums where there's no profanity etc. Because I'm the only modeller they have, me leaving for a week is a big deal. I'll miss it for awhile. Well, I'm off to enjoy my day and go get some breakfast. I'll see about possibly putting in a blog or two while on my cruise. Later!
