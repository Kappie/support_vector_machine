That feeling is never good it gets me into a lot of trouble. I have a math test coming up that is going to take a lot of prep and while I've started doing this prep I don't know if I can motivate myself enough to actually do enough work. I'm very tired I just can't seem to get into anything lately, and I have a lot more anger now then I usually do. I need to take stock of my self get better control over myself unfortunatly I don't seem to have the time.
