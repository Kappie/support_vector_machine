Wow!  There're actually lots of things which I haven't discovered in the room next to mine. Lots and lots of barcode scanners, optical fibre network devices, SCSI adapters, primitive notebooks, etc etc. The list goes on and on. Nobody's going to use 'em except me... if I want to.  So, I took a few SCSI cards + a hard disk to begin with. This is enough to keep me entertained for a week, before I move on to a new game with the treasures.  Pity. They just bury the treasure. Lucky. I am the one who went there digging them out. :)  What a lucky day.
