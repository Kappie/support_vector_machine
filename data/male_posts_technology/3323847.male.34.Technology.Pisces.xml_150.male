To put it in a nutshell, it seems TiVo owners will soon be able to transfer their saved shows to their computers (or others over the internet).  I've been clamoring for this feature since I first started filling up the drive space on my TiVo.  My current solution?  Use the TV card in my PC to record the shows I want to save, then archiving them to DVD.  Only then do I delete the show from my TiVo.  If I could transfer the saved show from the TiVo to my PC over my home network, my production time (to create a DVD) would be cut by a very large margin, and I'd have more free space (on average) on my TiVo.  Anyway, all the whining by the content owners just strengthens my belief in the fact that nothing will ever make them happy.  If these people don't get with the program and start working on some compromises, they will eventually discover that their iron-clad grasp of their content wasn't nearly as iron-clad as they had thought.
