"I went to the check in desk and asked for information.. " said 25 year-old James. "They said they had to cancel the flight because they Isle of Man had vanished"  A Manx airlines pilot had discovered the disappearance of the 227 square mile landmass on his return flight. He then called over the intercom to the passengers that they would be diverted to Dublin instead, and free drinks were served by the stewardesses, in a reportedly 'carnival like atmosphere'.  There was no wide spread panic at the airport, with only two members of the public requesting information. "Isn't there where they hold the TT?" commented one man. "Bugger.. I guess it'll be Le Mans this year instead."  The theft of the island and population of 76,300 has been reported to the authorities, who replied "Yeah.. we heard something about that. If you seen any sheep or branches of Pickwicks being held ransom, then please let us know."   Before:    After:
