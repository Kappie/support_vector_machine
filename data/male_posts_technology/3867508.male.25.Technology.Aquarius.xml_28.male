Specifically on the point of claiming that John Edwards was Kerry's second choice for VP after John McCain.  First of all the mainstream press just JUMPED on this story and spread it around like near death bees fiercely polinating 10 acres of flowers!  Even though the Kerry camp rebutted the story saying he never asked McCain to be his VP, hardly a mention of this from the mainstream media.  Now let me insert a short story from the alternet.org website, which by the way is a good place to get non-mainstream news.   urlLink www.alternet.org/election04/2004/07/002151.html   The basic gist of the story is that while the Bush team immediately, and I do mean  IMMEDIATELY  put out the story that John McCain was Kerry's first choice, and by the way released a new ad with John McCain giving Bush a nice glowing introduction for a speech Bush was about to make, the story goes that Bush's first choice for VP in 2000 was not Cheney, but actually John McCain!  Now whether this could ever be proven is a whole other issue, BUT there is as much evidence, if not more for this Cheney as second choice as there is for Edwards as second choice.  Ok I was going to stop with the politics, but here is another issue that got me fired up.  And its in the mainstream press (insert a smiley face with mouth wide open and eyes all big).  urlLink www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/07/08/bush.naacp.ap/index.html   Bush declines an invitation to speak at the NAACP annual convention.  Ok maybe that is understandable, he is busy right now with this whole campaign thing, but wait.  Here is a direct quote from the article.   "NAACP spokesman John White said Wednesday that Bush has declined invitations in each year of his presidency -- becoming the first president since Herbert Hoover not to attend an NAACP convention."  Now that should speak volumes enough, I think.  But WAIT!  Here is a quote from whitehouse spokesman Jim Morrell.   "White House spokesman Jim Morrell said Wednesday that the president has spoken about "equal opportunity and equal rights for all Americans" in many public places"  Holy sh**!  Is it just me or does that sound very condescending?  He has spoken about this whole "equal rights thing" before in other places, what's the big deal?  Anyway ok I am done for now.  I am here at work, just another day of sitting here in front of this computer!  I'll have more to say later maybe.
