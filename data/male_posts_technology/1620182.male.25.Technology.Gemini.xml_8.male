 We're looking at less than twelve hours before I  urlLink leave  for the sin city (not to be confused with  urlLink Vice City ), a land of harsh neon lights,  urlLink extreme (dry) heat , and fabulously overdone  urlLink luxory .  You'd think I'd be excited about my first trip to Las Vegas, but I'm not.  Why?  Mostly because I know that this is just a change in venue for my toil.  I almost envy my teammates who get to stay behind and "support" our efforts at the conference.
 
 On the other hand, I  will  be in Vegas after all.  And despite the fact that I'll probably have to work a few 14 hour days, I have a feeling that my friends and I will somehow find a way to squeeze some  urlLink gaming  into our schedules.  AND,  urlLink the conference  will be over on Thursday, which just happens to be the day after Rachael arrives.  PLUS, there is a light at the end of the tunnel with the product itself: we somehow talked the QA engineers into letting us release a beta version to a few clients.  So it looks like the conference truly will be the hump we've all been waiting to get over.
 
 " Vegas baby, Vegas. " -- Trent
