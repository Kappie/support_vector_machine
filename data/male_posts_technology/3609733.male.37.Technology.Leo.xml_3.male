Awesome!  He is such an accomplished racer.  I wish the Toronto media would notice him and give him the air time he deserves.  Maybe he likes it that way, he can go out in public and no one knows who he is.  A second in class at LeMans after all that trouble is amazing.  I'd like to see him win a Cup race to add to his trophy case.
