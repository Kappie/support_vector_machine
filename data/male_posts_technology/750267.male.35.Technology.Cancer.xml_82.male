Today, the pizza took 44 minutes. So I told the pizza driver, "Hey, sorry guy, but you're late." Needless to say, he was very disappointed. "But I was stuck in the snow. I had to get people to help get my car going again." I think he was hoping that I wouldn't notice and just pay, like 50% of people probably do when their pizza is late.  So my question is, do drivers have to pay for late pizzas? Was I taking $15 out of this guy's pocket? I'm slightly regretting my decision to enforce their guarantee. But then the cynic in me thinks, maybe he was just running late and his "stuck in the snow" story is just a lie he came up with. Maybe he  knew  he was late, and this was the best story he could come up with. I don't feel that bad, and my pizza is a bit cold actually.
