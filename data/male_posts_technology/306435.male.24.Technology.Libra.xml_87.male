It is some of the lamest stuff you have ever seen.  Anyway, I have had a pretty wonderful time this weekend.  I went to the Reds game Friday night and Tom, Justin and I worked our way down to the blue section just in time to see the Reds cut a 8-1 lead to 8-7 before letting us down.  It was really cold too, so cheering helped warm us up.  Tom and Justin blame the loss on an Amazon looking dude who changed cheering positions towards the end of the inning.  Ann was on retreat all weekend.  actually she lead the Approach retreat this weekend.  this is the same retreat I went on two years ago.  She had been practicing her speach over and over again, and from what I have been told she did a wonderful job.  Megan halverson helped lead the retreat too.  That made me pull out my Grace and the Cgravel Road CD.  I really like the cd.  I don't know what I like more...the songs or knowing the people who sing them.  Okay that is about all I have for ya....I am workign the late shift so I might post  from work a couple of times this week.  Lata...
