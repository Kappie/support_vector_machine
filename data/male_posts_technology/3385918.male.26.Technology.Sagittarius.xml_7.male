No escape, darkness falls and I sick into despair.  Dead to the world, let me live. Dreaming, sleeping, gasping… No air in these lungs would only say that which I can only scream out.    Let me be, let me be. Let me die, drop from your grasp, even for a moment. Let me not feel, let me not cry,  Let me just hate, and brood.  I will sink away, no worries.   Just forget that the rain of blood, like tears, flow from my eyes. Like a river of pain inside me.  Your cause, your victory. So I ask, and I ask this of the world…  Let me be, let me be. Let me die, drop from your grasp, even for a moment. Let me not feel, let me not cry,  Let me just hate, and brood.  I will sink away, no worries.    And so my words become nothing, But I am still here, fading. Wish I could disappear, reappear… Someplace else, live, love… Be one and know no one, except he who has what I look for… Acceptance, the key master to my loneliness.
