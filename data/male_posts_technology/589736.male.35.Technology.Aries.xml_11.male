Players may come and go, but I will be writing and running some sort of game as long as people want to participate in such.  # posted by Harmony : 10/15/2003 03:31:00 PM   so does that mean rtg will last until 2005?  # posted by hotcocoa : 10/15/2003 02:56:13 PM   At my current pace, I will graduate in either Dec '05 or May '06. Sure takes a long time to earn 48 credits.  # posted by Harmony : 10/15/2003 11:46:41 AM
