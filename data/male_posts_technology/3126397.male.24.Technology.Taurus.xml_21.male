I have very little doubt that this movie rocks. 8:24pm - Nearly 2.5 hours of my life later, and has my estimate of  urlLink Blues Brothers  changed?  Not drastically.  I was a bit nervous when  urlLink Pricess Leia  started shooting at them with a rocket launcher, but they took it in stride, so I figured, why shouldn't I?  This movie is certainly packed with big names, good music, and plenty of old-school car chase action.  It is like Grand Theft Auto - Vice City, when you have 5 stars and things are getting REALLY serious except it is in Chicago.  Staying cool and being able to sleep through a night long car chase with 40 cops on one's tail seems to be the ticket however. I NEED to find "Boots, black.  Belt, black.  One black suit jacket.  One pair of black suit pants.  One hat, black.  One pair of sunglasses.  Twenty three dollars and seven cents."
