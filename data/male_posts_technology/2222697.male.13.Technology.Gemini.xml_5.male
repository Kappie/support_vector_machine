Now I dont know what to do. I have decided to go with that $$$841 computer from ABLE ELECTRONICS. Its a better deal and i get more flexibility with it.  And im glad i found out that the dell i was going to get had a graphics card BUILT IN TO THE MOTHER BOARD! And thats not good. I have almost beat dbz budokai with my spare time. My movie and site are building themselves to perfection and all they need is patience. And you can be freakishly excited that the video will be released by this friday i will update you then and i will give you a link. From, Anime Geek
