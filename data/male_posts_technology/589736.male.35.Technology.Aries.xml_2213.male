According to this book, which supposedly got its info from the producer or director (sorry, I never can keep who does what, but that is a different topic),  Decker is replicant in both the released version and the original version.  Where the hell did that come from?  I have seen the movie at least a half dozen times, but have never thought that.  Am I just way out in la-la land? [avoid the temptation on that one Mir  ;) ]  Did I miss something?
