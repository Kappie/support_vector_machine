Sometimes I wonder what the point of everything is and if going to college and getting good grades really will matter in the long run. Well, I don't know whether that kind of stuff is important or not. But I do know that despite all the dumb things we do to make ourselves feel like we're doing something special- getting a job, going to school, etc- there are moments in between that make it all worth it. Yesterday I was sitting on a rock on the shore at Friday harbor labs watching the boats go in and out... watching the waves and the sunlight as it glittered and sparkled across the tremulous blue. There was the wind, the sun, the rock, and myself. In that moment, the only thing that mattered was that I was there. And all the work that I've done to get to that spot made it all worth it.
