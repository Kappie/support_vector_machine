But can't say why ....Alright actually I blogged about it just now but then realised its not cool to bitch abt someone when i know they are reading it so took it off.   A stupid mynah took a dump on my shirt today during lunchtime ...out of a 100 people it had to choose me. I never win anything in lucky draws but when it comes to this kinda stuff totally different story.  Too tired to blog further, going to bed ...oh Jenna won Survivor, I think she has to be the most undeserving winner ever, Rob totally deserved it imo.
