BTW, I have not enabled comments on many of my recent posts. What is your opinion, should they be enabled or disabled? I would like to enable them, provided they are used. No use in enabling comments and no comments are present.  Rajesh had come home last evening. Vijay had called. Watched a lot of movies, (reviews soon) and books (reviews  urlLink here ). Other than that the last week has been spent deleting hundreds of virii infected mails. Still deleting them... That's why I could not mail/reply to anyone.  On the work front, a coupe of days absence has precipitated a lot of pending tasks. I am striving hard to complete them  asap .  Rini, the colors were nice, but the best thing I liked was the use of asterisks in the title. It was fabulous. Hope to see a lot more posts in the future on flowers. BTW, any snaps of your garden available.  Manny, the link you gave didn't work. Send it to my postmark id. Any luck with FrameMaker tutorials???
