"you're not blogging enough... boo hoo... whine whine..."  well excuuuuuuuuuuuuse me!  maybe some people aren't working hard enough... huh!?!?  so anyway... there's not much to talk about.  work is a bitch, my sister leaves for china tomorrow morning for 5 weeks, mom and dad are coming down tonight to take her to the airport and say good bye, and i'm looking at buying a house.  so there... my life.  and now i've blogged, you may put away your kleenex.
