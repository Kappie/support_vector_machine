Fedor Emelianenko vs. Kevin Randleman   While conventional wisdom is that Fedor will win this one, I am going to go with my gut and say Randleman. If Randleman keeps listening to Mark Coleman, and brings the same game he brought to Cro-Cop, he will be unstoppable. Of course, the key word is if.   Anotonio Nogueira vs. Heath Herring   I think Nogueira will win this one by decision, just like he did the last time he fought Heath Herring. Nogueira has been on a role, having lost just one match in the last 4 years. Herring has been doing well as of late too, winning his last 4 matches, but he hasn't had to fight the same level of opponents as Nogueira, and more importantly, he just doesn't have what it takes to win this match up.   Paulo Cesar Silva vs. Naoya Ogawa   I expect Ogawa to pick up the victory, but it won't be as easy as some of his past fights. Giant Silva is one big dude, a knockout is out of the question, so Ogawa will have to pick up a submission, or just tough it out until a decision.   Semmy Schilt vs. Sergei Kharitonov   After seeing Sergei mop the floor with Ninja, I think this one is a no-brainer. Sergei, by knockout.   Kazushi Sakuraba vs. Antonio Schembri   I don't expect Sakuraba to lose to Schembri a second time. I expect him to fight a cautious fight, and win by decision.   Quinton Jackson vs. Ricardo Arona   My inital thoughts were Arona, because Jackson hasn't had a match in 6 months. I still think that Arona will win, but not for the reason stated above. I just looked up Arona's stats, and Arona hasn't had a match in 18 months, so in that regard, Jackson has an advantage. I think the two are pretty evenly matched in skill, Jackson's win over Chuck Lidell was a huge win for him. So why do I still choose Arona? I believe the victor will be the person who wants the win more, and from what I am hearing, Jackson isn't very interested in fighting anymore.   Hidehiko Yoshida vs. Mark Hunt   If this goes to the ground, Yoshida should win by submission, if it stays on the feet, Mark Hunt should get the knockout. I don't see this match going to a decision. My instincts tell me to go with Yoshida.
