I JUST got it down to 1 hr 5 minutes a few minutes ago. You cannot imagine the elation and pride I felt when I achieved that; it's times like these that make me remember why I love my job so much. I am gonna call myself the compilation king from now on.   Oh and something only a computer geek will understand : I used vi so much the last 2 days that when I was typing out my report for the compilation results I actually tried to use "x" to delete words. Hahaha.  How funny is that ?  OK I NEED TO GET A LIFE.
