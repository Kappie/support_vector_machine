He spins around as you enter.  "Hax, we need to talk...."  Hax is obviously nervous.  "Oh, hey, boss, um, I ws gonna call....um, listen, I've got news here."  Jean is unimpressed.  "Oh, you do, do you?"  Hax nods.  "Yeah, yeah, I do.  Y'see this?"  He indicates a machine on the bench.  You recognize it from teh video and the dumpster.  He's taken it and rebuilt it.  "It's a total load of crap.  Never could, never would do anything but hold a paper down in a strong wind..."
