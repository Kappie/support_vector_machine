I ended up in one of the state local channels, which concentrates on kids.....they telecast kids shows  try to teach them something evrytime......yesterday, they were telecasting a documentary with the topic "Education in other countries"....for the rest of the post, just imagine the reels u used to watch in theatres before the actual movie being played......         First came a poor Japenese kid (10 yrs).....wakes up in the morning, has their kind of breakfast (inbetween he talks to the camera, which is being translated for us)Japan seems to be very clean, his outfits are really good, his classroom is very tidy, he comes back home  relaxes himself in a bath tub(remember he's poor).....Then a poor girl from Benin was shown (same 10 yrs).....has two sisters  two brothers(she too talks the same way to the camera, describing their life style).....her mother lost her job when the last baby was born......she's wearing torn out clothes, her bros were with shorts.......If the kids go to school their mom will get a stypend of $15/month  a packet of food everyday.....her class room is just a small hut, with 60 other kids in her class....they are asked to practise writing alphabets  numbers on the walls.....In the evning, they cook somehting, thta looks like porridge  everybody has that for dinner.....then came an poor Indian girl, named Neeraj.....from a village in Rajasthan......she did'nt know her age correctly.....she's going for school only for the past one yr....that too, night school, where only girls learn....she's already engaged to a guy,  will get married in another 5 to 6 yrs.....the whole morning, she works in her in-law's home.....evening she goes to school....but the guys, they go to the morning school.....her granny says education is a waste for her grand daughter.....only life'll teach her.....they cook in mud stoves (three stones on three corners, firewood in between)the place around is not tidy at all......they have roti for dinner( which was told as dry bread here)...... then came a Rumanian kid, then a brazilian kid  one another kid from south Africa.......        Finally their conclusion was, the kids from Japan  Rumania....their education is safe it seems,  hence thier lives too,....but for kids form the other developing nations, their education is not so promising, it seems.....So, when a kid here, watches this show, u know how he picturasizes India in his mind. I was really wondering.....are Kids like Neeraj, the majority in India....Shld this how, India be picturarised?.....I do agree that, there are kids who can'y afford to go to school in India.....but to give a true picture of India  Indian kids(any country for that matter), they shld have taken a kid from a middle class family (Which is the majority of our country)....ennavo oru inam puriyaadha kovam.....is my anger worthy enough????guys, need ur inputs on this.......
