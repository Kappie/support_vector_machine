Incase you have been living under a fucking tree for the last few days, read  urlLink this .  I don't know if I am ready to watch the video.  Frankly I don't know if I will ever be ready to watch a 'real' execution.    Sure I've seen shit in movies where people's heads get cut off or limbs shopped off.  Sure there's  urlLink Rotten.com  and there are a few disturbing images there, no videos though.  An analogy that I want to use would be the accident analogy.  Traffic backed up and you see a wreck in the distance.  Slowly you come closer to the accident scene and you get more and more intrigued with the whole thing.  You don't want to look but you can't help -but- look.  It could be bloody, it could be messy but you're still curious enough to keep your eye on the road and glance at the general direction hoping to catch a glimpse of something.  Except this time (with the Berg Video) you know what is going to happen.  His head was cut off, actually it was sawed off with a hack saw.  A dull, rusty hacksaw.  I don't consider myself a squeamish person but this might be too much for me.  I want to see it but I don't think I will ever be prepared to see it.  Is that sick or just humanity's morbid curiosity with death.  I don't have a link for the video but I heard on the radio that on  urlLink Mancow.com  there's a video somewhere.  The site might be a little overwhelemed right about now because of other people's curiousity with it so if you can't see it and really want to see it, I would suggest sometime late in the evening or over the weekend.
