When you cannot easily express it though you can inwardly understand it, if you are not fretful I will not guide you.  When I explain one angle to you, if you do not answer the other three using your brain I will not repeat my lesson."   -- Yoshita Furukawa, the Analects of Confucius excerpted in Roots of the Japanese Mind Â© 1968 Tokyo, Japan
