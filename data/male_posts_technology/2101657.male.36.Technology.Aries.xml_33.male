I put down states that I have physically been in, I didn't include states that I've flown over.  Missing from the map though, I see I forgot Mississippi and Arkansaw (or is that Alabama?)  lol   We used to do alot of traveling when I was growing up, during our summer vacation.  Have drove to Florida twice, went to South Dakota, with a brief foray into Wyoming to visit the Tetons and Devils Tower (no mashed potatoe jokes please).    The only reason I've been to the west coast, was when I went as part of the National Guard. The one time I went to Camp Hunter Ligget(sp), we flew into VanDenberg AFB, and bused to the base.   The other time we flew from Waterloo, Iowa, to Las Vegas (didnt get to have any fun) and then were hauled in charter buses for 4hrs out into the Mohave Desert to NTC, also known as the National Training Center.  That was a fun time! Really! It was!  Very kewl way to see the desert.  Well, I'm off to shovel snow, it looks like we're finally going to get some snow! woohoo!! so naturally what happens? My snowblower is out of gas (how ironic!)  Time to shovel!  And always remember, play it safe and be careful!
