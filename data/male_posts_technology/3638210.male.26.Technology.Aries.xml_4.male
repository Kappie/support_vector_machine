I used to know a goodly amount of html, but that was for the two weeks I had to write a web page for my Advanced Programming class in college.  The page got an 'A', but the knowledge got the boot.  Making room for such vital information as the distance of Earth from the sun and lyrics to songs I am ashamed to mention.  Anyway, so it looks like my initial entry worked just fine.  Not that this is brain surgery, but sometimes it's a nice feeling when something (technology to be specific) works the way it should.  Perhaps it is my recent dealing with a particularly irritating piece of tech-ery that makes something as simple as a web page successfully updating seem like the discovery of fire.  The culprit is DirecTV.  I have (or had) them as my satellite service provider.  The system was installed last year, though they had to drill a hole or three through my walls--rather than patching through the existing cable--to get things to work.  Well, things have been mostly fine, with the exception of a garbled signal when it rains... or looks like it may rain... or when I say the word "rain"...  But anyway, the past few weeks have been exceptionally bad regardless of weather conditions.  It was as if scrambled porn and a turn table with Tourette's had a love child on every single channel.  Anyway, so I made a service call and the guy says, "Yeah, this should never have been installed here.  Your trees in the backyard are directly in the dish's line of sight."  Yeah, a little irritating.  Well, he suggested that I could raise the dish, but I would need to check with my Home Owner's Association.  Fine.  That makes sense.  Oh, and I have to buy and cut a special fencing pipe myself.  Less fine.  Less sense.  But I'm still amiable.  So I do all of the above and reschedule a service call.  The man calls at the beginning of when he's supposed to be there asking if I had permission and the equipment.  "Yes, that is what I was told to do and why you're scheduled to come out."  Then he claims that "they've" got him all over the place today so he might not make it.  Well, sorry, but am I not one of those places?  He had from 1pm to 5pm and I had plans at 7.  So 5:30, still not there and I call to tell him forget it.  I call DirecTV and see if they can make an appointment on Sunday which they can't because that's special and handled locally and blah blah... things I understand, but am too irritated to care about.  Then on top of that, he mentions that the comment on the work request says I needed to have permission to raise the dish "in writing" from the HOA.  What!?  More hoops to jump through.  More irritation.  The customer service guy tries to say how bad he's got it because he has to open the window in his apartment on cloudy days.  I try to care, but fail to.  I spent the rest of the day pondering if it was worth it.  And then the answer came to me.  As I was flipping through the 99.9% garbled junk, one channel comes in clearly.  It was running the movie " urlLink From Justin To Kelly ".  Fortunately the sound was muted, but even in closed caption it made me a little sick to my stomach.  This is when I realized that things just weren't going to work out between me and DirecTV.  I called, got my service disconnected as of midnight that night, and the next day in the mail got a promo to "Ditch The Dish" and get $400 from  urlLink Comcast  cable, which is what my neighborhood is prewired for.  So... life sucks for a short period of time, then things change to make it even--if not slightly better.  I suppose that "crappy satellite reception" runs low on the list of the world's problems, but there you have it.
