Feeling better than earlier today, I was ready to pass out on the side of the road at one point. Anyway, besides the point ain't it?  So I dropped my shag off this morning, man, she looks cuter this morning than she did last night! Naturally, there seemed to be a number of inexplicable love bites on her soft sexy neck! Rowr!!   Oh, she is a mom, she has a 18 month old baba... She is still married, but in the process of getting a divorce ;-) Her and her husband have been seperated for the past 2 and a half months.   God damn arseholes like that make me sick! He used to beat her!!! I mean, seriously... if you had to see this woman, with such a sunny disposition... beautiful smile... and a myriad of other attributes which make it quite impossible to have any thoughts of raising a hand to her beautiful face in anger, you would know what I'm saying. And thats not the only abuse she suffered at the hands of this bloody prick... Emotional abuse also played a large role in her being stuck in the relationship for so long.  I think there should be a special place in hell reserved for woman beaters and rapists. They don't deserve anything as nice as an eternal pit of fire, soul burning for an eternity... agonizing, excruciating pain. Nothing that nice should await guys like that. I wish I could dream of a more sadistic and cruel way to punish them for an eternity... I leave that to the universe though...  Bastards!
