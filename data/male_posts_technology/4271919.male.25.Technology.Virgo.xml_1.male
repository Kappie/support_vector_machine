Not so long ago I ridiculed my friends that latched on to this, what I considered, fad. However, I have to say that I'm quite flexible when it comes to ideas (OK, OK, I'm a flake, I admit it) so here I am. Please note that since I'm still perma-lazy that my musings and speculations will probably be RARE by any real "blogger" standard. I will never be able to approach the prolific output of  urlLink Showalter's Politics  or the jibber-jabber of  urlLink Dockgoose  but might be more on par with the meditations of  urlLink Kriegsmarine , perhaps even surpassing the output of  urlLink Kriegsmarine . In fact I might be more active on other people's postings than my own. Also note that I will not limit my talk to any certain subject. Although I might opt to be more political here, I will also present you with irrelevant snippets of speculation on everything. OK, I'm already getting bored with writing this so I'm going to cut it short here. Not sure when I'll update again but it will definitely be sometime this week. Ciao, kids
