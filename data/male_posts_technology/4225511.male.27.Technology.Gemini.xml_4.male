Very informative read here:  urlLink Twin Scroll Turbo   Now when it comes to Twin Turbo, there seems to be two different versions: Sequential Twin Turbo, and the regular Twin Turbo. Twin turbo is simply fitting 2 turbo chargers under the hood; while the Sequential Twin Turbo means having two different turbos under the hood, having 1 cover for the other's shrotcomings.  Here's a short quote: "he Supra's engine has a 0.5-litre swept capacity advantage and it also relies on just one of its sequential twin-turbos to give a massive whack of boost (and therefore torque) at low rpm and load. The second turbo then comes on to maintain torque in mid-to-high rpm and load ranges. Put simply, this two-stage turbo system gives a tremendous dollop of torque everywhere in the rev range.  The Soarer - most unfortunately - doesn't have a sequential turbo set-up. The gasses exiting its 1JZ-GTE head are constantly divided into two simultaneously operating turbos; this means boost response and low-rpm torque are both a fair way behind the sequentially-turbo'd RZ Supra."  and that's not it... there are quite a few other turbo variations such as twin entry turbo which has 2 divorced turbo inlets.  I think I've had enough of this for the day...
