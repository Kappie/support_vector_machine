Went pretty smooth, was easy actually! just don't ask me to do a A3 page with 12.1 inch margins, or anything stupid like that!  (in other words I used an A4 template) ;)  Now for the two last parts; making a SMS XSL template and creating the XHTML design... Shouldn't be more than, oh, 15 hours of work or there abouts! :)
