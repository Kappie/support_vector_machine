Need for Speed: Underground... u can really taste the garden-grown goodness. i hope the southern public has a need for speed - 'cuz i got a need for their money! i'm actually impressed by the $50 video editing software i bought for the gig - it gives the illusion of professional quality... ha! after getting down and dirty, this ride really only took about 3 or 4 hours to edit. most of the "work" involved hours of racing through the streets of ____ City over and over again to capture the most   Action-Packed!   footage i could collect. In the end, i'm fairly pleased - with it being my first ride - and will be able to build upon my experience and software upgrades to pop out some unique masterpieces of video game adaptation. Now to spend the next week programming the bitch...
