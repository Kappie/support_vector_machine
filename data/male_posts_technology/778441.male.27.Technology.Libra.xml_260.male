The colorized photograph shows Earth from 86 million miles away as a small blue dot orbited by its even smaller moon.  Strange!! No one ever asked me to "Say Cheese!!"  Just go and have a look at the snaps  urlLink here . And then you'll realize what once prompted Carl Sagan to write...  "Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives,"
