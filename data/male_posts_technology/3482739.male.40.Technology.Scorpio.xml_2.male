She's got the wettest sounding cough you'd ever want to hear and he is saying its all cuz her tummy is all fooked up. I think she's allergic to LA. Heaven knows she was sick MUCH less often in Seattle. It could of course be the stress of her job, which she loves (for the most part).  But of course "just cause you love your job doesn't always mean no stress" as a friend said.
