I was in a local computer store the other day, and they had a small Apple Mac display over in the corner. It's one of these "store within a store" concepts.  First of all, I took a look at a couple of PowerBooks. These are strange looking machines, as their LCD's are the wide-screen version. I go weak in the knees over large plasma television displays, but for some reason the wide laptop displays threw me off. It would take some getting used to I guess. The quality of the displays were gorgeous, however. I don't know if the Mac can display more colors than a typical Windows box, but these PowerBooks were certainly configured with some vibrant desktop wallpaper. The colors really stood out.  I saw some iBooks, and they really looked cheap. White plastic? Ugh. I guess if you're carrying an iBook around you stand out in a crowd, whereas all Windows laptops look alike. But still, didn't find much about the iBooks I liked visually.  Finally, I checked out the G5 display. Again, huge wide screen cinema display. The one button mouse felt odd in my hand, like I was missing a valuable shortcut. I am so used to right-clicking to bring up a popup menu I can't imagine a UI without one.   And here's the big relevation for me. I looked at the Mac OS X interface, and I was lost. The desktop was completely clear, only a finder at the bottom and a menu along the top. I didn't know where to click at first. It was almost like entering an empty room. "What now?"  I finally clicked the little IE icon on the finder bar. Cool animation. The IE icon, instead of acting like a Windows button, bounced up and down for a second like a rubber ball. Someone spent a lot of time getting icons to do that. IE opened, and immediately gave me an error message because there was no Internet connection. But the error box was the prettiest thing I had ever seen. The OK button was pulsating, like a liquid orb of some sort. I didn't want to click it, I wanted to watch it pulsate for a little while. Someone spent a lot of time making that button pulsate.  Finally, I went to close IE. The upper minimize, maximize, close titlebar buttons each had their own color. When you moved the mouse over them, they animated. Wow. It reminded me that the Windows titlebar buttons have not changed in more than 10 years since Windows 3.1.  And all this, made me think ... the Mac is not the right computer for me. It's a work of art. Every thing about it has been thoroughly designed, with a great attention to detail. The box it ships in, the outer case of the computer itself, the monitor, every icon, every button and every pixel. The guy selling the computer is dressed in black. People that own Macs tend to love them like a member of their family.  It's a work of art, and art is meant to be watched, not used. I need a work tool. I need to get things done, and I don't care if the cardboard box it came in is brown. I don't care if the computer case is grey. I don't need a wide-screen (movie-theater style) monitor. My buttons do not have to pulsate or animate or anything. That's why the Mac will never gain wide acceptance. They have not sold people on the concept of a computer as a fashion accessory. "Think different", they say? "Just do it", I say.
