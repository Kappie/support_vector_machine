I saw it at the cinema, and have owned it for about a year on DVD, but never got round to watching it.  I was surprised at how much CG technology has progressed in the few years since its release.  Or maybe money is a factor...   The Bourne Identity  comes next methinks... just in time for its sequel which is due out soon.  Now  that  is something I've got round to watching.
