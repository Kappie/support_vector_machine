I think I've started something that might be difficult to finish.  I guess "Boz" is the hose, "Dvl" is the diving board.  And...umm...the light there in the rose bed?  That's "Hard Artist" because it's metal and therefore hard.  Off camera, there are 2 inflatable water wings floating around - "Zann" and "Mike".  There's a snorkle that will hereby be known as "Zoot".  When I look in the water, I call my reflection "Marci" since she's my doppleganger.  Damn...what else is there?  I've bit off more than I could chew.  Well, there's an empty beer bottle that I'll have to name "Gooseneck" since there's no tequila.  And "The Bored Housewife" is what I shall call the barbecue grill (but not out loud in front of the house owners).  And "Jonnie" is, of course, me. I need to go buy beer.
