In other news I'm really sick of the whole Reagan funeral/carnival I mean this guy did so much illegal crap and he is responsible for the whole neo-conservative movement. This guy shouldn't be honored he should have died in prison. In other news  urlLink here  is a cool link to an article on nano assemblers.
