True equality between the races and the sexes (and any other group that is currently "distinguished")would ultimately ruin this country and potentially the world. PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT. Not only are white people different from black people and latinos and asians, but EVERY white person is different from EVERY OTHER white person. The same for blacks, latinos, asians, etc.    The notion of equality is a noble idea, but is not practical at all. Everyone is unique. I am a near genius when it comes to writing a software program (not to pat myself on the back or anything), but I don't know shit about cars, other than how to change the oil. If you told me that my muffler flange needed to be replaced I would believe you, because I do not have the knowledge to know any better.    The mechanic down the street may not know jack about computers, but would know that there is NO SUCH THING as a muffler flange. It is obvious that we are very different. We probably would even have very different social lives and tendencies. Now, what right would I have in demanding that I receive the same treatment from employers seeking to hire a mechanic? What if I were black looking into hiring into a government mechanic shop with 7 white mechanics?    The very mention of the word "black" seemingly has everyone's panties in a bunch, as if I cannot make a distinction between a black man and a white man (just ask Rush Limbaugh and ESPN). Same holds true for any sort of distinction. The next time you tell a story, instead of using a man or a woman, throw in the race (heck, even the mention of "woman" will sometimes get you into trouble in certain circumstances). Next time you listen to the radio, listen to some of the hoops they have to jump through. We're not supposed to make a distinction any more.    People outcried at the questioning of Arab members of the community in post 9/11 America. They called it racial profiling. I call it good police work. If the prime suspect(s) of a crime fit a certain race or sex, why would you question anyone outside their category? If a suspect is estimated at 6'3" tall, would you call it "tall people" profiling if the police questioned only people over 6 foot tall?    This de-identification of our country has already taken place in our commercial products. Everyday items that began as brand names have, through convenience, become the product household words. The biggest one that pops into my head is Jell-O. Jell-O is a BRAND NAME, not the product. The product is "gelatin." There is no such thing as Meijer Brand Jell-O (Meijer is a regional grocery/everything else store in the midwest). Same for Kleenex. Puffs does not make Kleenex, they make "facial tissue." Many other brands have become household words including aspirin, cellophane, nylon, thermos, and escalator. EACH of those started as a trademark, but through public use has become the generic name.    The same public use of those terms, will be the same public LACK of use of distinguishing terms (black, white, asian, male, female) that will ultimately deter these types of distinctions. Try and describe the person who robbed your store without uttering any of the following words: white, black, asian, african, american, italian, latino, mexican, male, female, etc. That is what the powers that be would have you do. THAT would be true equality - making NO distinction.    Before I get lambasted, I will state that I am all for TREATING people with the same respect and dignity that I would like in return. You can TREAT people as equal, but they will never truly BE equal.
