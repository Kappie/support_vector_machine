It kicked ass and was a vast improvement on the first one.  I don't think it is the greatest super hero movie of all time, that honor goes to  Unbreakable  or  Superman II . Toby's Peter Parker was a bit more of a gloomy gus than he ever was in the comics.  Kirsten Dunst looked either horrid or beautiful depending on the scene.  Albert Molina ruled as Doctor Octopus and lots of cool stuff was set up for the next film with Harry Osborn and Dr. Curt Connors.
