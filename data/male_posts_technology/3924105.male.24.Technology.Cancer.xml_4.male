So maybe that answer will come in time, and I'll find that this is a waste. But the truth is, I know precisely what I'd write about. Whether or not anybody wants to read it is a different story entirely.  On a lighter note, I am now the Systems Administrator for a little startup company called Oregon3D (www.oregon3d.com). Thus far it's a great job, and I have a great deal to learn. There's something simply exciting about being tossed a list of techie projects and given free reign to do as you please, so long as you produce results. That's my kind of environment.  At any rate, SuSE calls, and I must answer...
