I went to Golden Gardens and walked around. I went to a dog park and watched the dogs play. I saw a movie, Supersize Me. I ate some pho and some Mr. Lee's Asian Restaurant. I went to Alki Beach and walked to boardwalk. I took multiple photos. I talked to Jay about a short film entitled "rejected".  My friend left for Hawaii today. She is going to see her sister and was going for the birth of her neice which happened a month early, yesterday. I think that would be frustrating.  Well, I'm sure she'll have fun and now I have to work again.  Lost in my sea of uncertainty- Tim
