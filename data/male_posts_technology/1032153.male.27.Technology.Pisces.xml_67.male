Now let us imagine that the fault lay with both people, and the nice police man came and wrote up a report in Italian, and translated it into English, which I sign (assuming the same is said in Italian.) The version of the incident that I sign says since the fault lies with both of us, I will only need to pay $100 and the man who banged into me will pay me $100  and will take his car to the panel-beaters. The Italian version says I must pay $100 and the Italian man must pay me $100 and I must bring the other mans car to the panel-beaters. Since I signed the English version I have different expectations to the Italian man who signed the Italian one. The document cannot be made a legal document, since neither party was aware at the time of signing the true obligations he was expected to fulfill.  In a similar way we have a problem with the treaty.  Now I come to a more important point. How long does this 'legal' treaty last for? Is it a treaty that lasts forever? And if so what kind of special powers does it have? Does it use them for good or for awesome? no but seriously guys, what other treaty lasts forever?  Let's investigate:- 1) Versailles, Treaty of, peace treaty signed at the end of World War I between Germany and the Allies. It was negotiated during the Paris Peace Conference held in Versailles beginning January 18, 1919. .....By the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was required to abolish compulsory military service; to reduce its army to 100,000; to demilitarize all the territory on the left bank of the Rhine River and also that on the right bank to a depth of 50 km (31 mi); to stop all importation, exportation, and nearly all production of war material; to limit its navy to 24 ships, with no submarines, the naval personnel not to exceed 15,000; and to abandon all military and naval aviation by October 1, 1919. Germany also agreed to permit the trial of former emperor William II by an international court on the charge of "a supreme offense against international morality."  2) Locarno, Treaties of, series of seven agreements designed to promote the security of western Europe at the end of World War I (1914-1918). The treaties were signed by representatives from Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Britain, Italy, and Poland in Locarno, Switzerland, on October 16, 1925, and signed in London, England, on December 1, 1925. The first of the Locarno treaties guaranteed the common boundaries of France, Germany, and Belgium. The Rhineland, an area covering parts of Belgium, France, and Germany, was established as a neutral zone. The British and Italians were involved in the guarantee, but they did not have any new military obligations to ensure the implementation of the treaties. Although France signed security treaties with Poland and Czechoslovakia, the treaties did not offer the same frontier recognition to the countries on Germany's eastern borders. There were, however, agreements providing for the arbitration of disputes between Germany and its Belgian, French, Czechoslovak, and Polish neighbors. The treaties were to operate within the framework of the League of Nations, which Germany joined in 1926.  3) Charles the Bold (1433-1477), last duke of Burgundy, the son of Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, and Isabella of Portugal, born in Dijon. In 1452 he became count of Charolais. When King Louis XI of France forced Philip to cede some towns on the Somme River, Charles formed the League of the Public Weal, an alliance of noblemen. League forces threatened Paris and defeated the king at MontlhÃ©ry, near Paris, in 1465. The result was the Treaty of Conflans, by which the towns on the Somme were restored and the counties of Boulogne, Guines, and Ponthieu were granted to Charles.  4) The Treaty of Frankfurt, signed on May 10, 1871, ended the war between France and Germany. The treaty provided that the French province of Alsace (excepting Belfort) and part of Lorraine, including Metz, were to be ceded to the German Empire, and that France was to pay a war indemnity of 5 billion gold francs ($1 billion), submitting to occupation by German troops until the amount was rendered in full. This heavy obligation was discharged in September 1873, and during the same month, after an occupation of almost three years, France was at last freed of German soldiers.  Just a few examples here. Note how in each case the treaty is formed in a certain situation. Now that this situation is no longer applicable, the treaties are irrelevant. (Check for example the standing army of less than 100,000 for Germany).  A treaty may be terminated by reliance on the principle rebus sic stantibus ("things remaining that way"), that is, when the state of affairs assumed by the signatory parties (when they signed the treaty, and therefore the real basis of the treaty), no longer exists, and a substantial change in conditions has taken place. Is this not the case?!   (Information courtesy of Encarta 2000)    urlLink Allan's  brush with Racism   Check this out, i was really angry when this happened.
