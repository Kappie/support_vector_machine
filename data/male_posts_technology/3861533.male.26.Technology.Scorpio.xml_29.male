On paper this should be a great movie considering the actors who are in it:  urlLink Matt Damon ,  urlLink Franka Potente ,  urlLink Brian Cox ,  urlLink Julia Stiles  and  urlLink Joan Allen . But it's not - it's just ok, partly because all the aforementioned actors except Damon are underused. They are so because the action scenes take up a large segment of the movie. Too large, in my view. I could have done with less action and more story and character development. Still, the quality is raised in the ending 5 minutes (where, incidentally  urlLink Oksana Akinshina  from  urlLink Lilja 4-ever  shows up). -->
