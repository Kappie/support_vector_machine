I have my run in the morning, but my friend Cliff (see running buddy) is moving to Lake Samamish(sp?) plateau. That means my current running buddy (see best friend) will be 45 minutes away on a good commute day :(  I am trying to get C# under my belt like no tomorrow. I have gotten my program to a point where I can download a webpage and extract all the img file locations and links. Next I need to work on erraticating duplicate links and links to other websites. Then I need to download each new webpage and rinse lather and repeat. It's really fun to problem solve and get this all figured out, but I'm scared that it won't be enough to land me a job :(  Anyway,I'm exhausted and horny and lonely, so I'm going to sleep. To all those out there celebrating the 4th. Happy independence day and I'll see you on the 5th.  Peace- T
