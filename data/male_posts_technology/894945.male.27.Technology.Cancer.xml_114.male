Although to be honest i guess is its a shame in a way that France and Argentina have gone out as both are great footballing nations. Except this time round the majority of the French players were too old and too slow, and as for the Argies they just assumed they were gonna steam role the competition (what with being most peoples fav/tip to win as well) but they forgot one simple rule...... THIS IS THE WORLD CUP YOU PRATS!!!! THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN EASY GAME. These are the best footballing countries in the world and no one comes just to make up the numbers so you cant expect just to whip everyone.   HAHA what makes it even sweeter tho is the comments made my an Argentinian player before the game against Sweden.... he said that they would beat sweden and then hammer England when they played them in the later rounds....... yeah on a playstation game maybe.
