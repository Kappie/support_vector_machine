So we do indeed have enough resources.  What I am going to discuss here is how to make the most of the experience of building your own guitar. when I say building, I of course dont mean that you cut the tree, forge the hardware, wind the pickups and build it from scratch, there are loads of companies who supply the necessary parts. The first example I can give is  urlLink warmoth  which is a company based in washington-USA; they specialize in building superior guitar parts, and they carry most of the hardware such as bridges, frets, pickups etc.  If we were to make our own guitar, the first step would probably be to make a feasibility research. Lets say the project guitar is a fender stratocaster type guitar, with fancy features. First lets see how much it costs to go buy the guitar from a store which carries the features we would want; lets see, I would like a locking tremolo, nice machine heads, jumbo frets, a rosewood fingerboard, an ash body, preferably one piece (which would produce a thick, rich sound because it is one piece and does not have any glue holding any parts together) nice electronics ( a shielded pickguard, which will help reduce the 60hz hum that is likely to emerge) quality pickups (lets say a humbucker for the bridge and two single coils for the mid and neck positions) a nice finish, and of course expert craftmanship, hand built if possible.  If you were to order this guitar from fender themselves, they would probably redirect you to their custom shop; lets see one guitar that I found which was listed for $2479 but was being sold for $1735 at  urlLink music123.com ; the specs are: alder, 3 pieces glued together; Vintage Style 2-Point Synchronized Tremolo with Stamped Solid Steel Saddles and Milled Solid Steel Block; rosewood fingerboard, maple neck, Machine Heads: Nickel/Chrome, Sperzel Trim-LokÂ® Staggered Tuning Machines; 22 frets, a gold anodized aluminum pickguard, cobalt blue transparent finish, gloss on neck, hot noisless bridge pickup and vintage noiseless pickups on the neck and middle positions. You can see the guitar itself  urlLink here .  Now lets try to build the same quailty, if not better guitar by using only warmoth, which by the way is not one of the cheapest companies on the market, you can probably get a better deal on parts if you do some  urlLink research  here goes the parts and prices body: one piece swamp ash with a contoured heel (which lets you have a better grip of the higher frets on the neck) and a transparent blue gloss: $405 neck: maple with rosewood fingerboard, double expanding truss rod, fender strat headstock, clear gloss finishing: $192 bridge: Gotoh Wilkinson Tremolo; chrome; $89, includes everything necessary to mount it. tuning pegs :Schaller Mini Locking Tuners; chrome : $48 for the full set.  input jack: chrome strat plate, Planet Waves gold plated stereo jack with multiple contact points; $16 set of knobs (volume-tone-tone): standard strat, white; $6 humbucker mounting rig: chrome: $7.50 plate (for the joint where the neck joins the body): chrome $4.50 pots: 1 500k for volume, one 250k for the mid-neck tone and one push and pull for the bridge which lets us do coil splitting, totals up to: $17 screws of all kinds: pickup, pickguard, bridge, tremolo etc: $10, all chrome. schaller locking strap holders: $12 chrome LSR roller nut (which has little iron balls which let the string slide when bended) $40 chrome. set of string retainers with the chrome bar; $10 5 way switch for the pickups: $12 copper shielding tape; about $5 for the whole pickguard wiring: $5.95 standard white pickuard, drilled for our choice of pickups, bridge and switches-knobs $20 Now this all totals up to $905 ; plus I will add another $100 just in case; what does that total? $1005; lets buy a case for the guitar for another $100; thats $1100 to round up.  Now the last thing we need to add is the pickups; you can buy good pickups from companies like seymour duncan for about $50-$60 each; or buy custom wound, boutique ones which could be more expensive or cheaper than widely commercial pickups from manufacturers like  urlLink lindy fralin ,  urlLink bill lawrence  etc. lets say we buy a set of seymour duncan, an alnico 2 humbucker for the bridge and two single coil vintage's for the neck and mid positions (and a reminder, these arent the best set you can buy for the price, you can get a full set from bill lawrence for about $130-but it will take about a month and a half for them to reach you) and that totals to something like $200 and the final subtotal would be $1300; now we have all the parts and we need to get them assembled; now you can do this yourself, if you have the patience and/or experience etc; but what I would suggest is to get help from a luthier, or a guitar technician, i.e. someone who has done work similar to this. Lets assume we pay the luthier a good $200 for an afternoons work (since there is no finishind, glueing etc. its only putting the parts together and turning some screws) and that totals up to $1500 doesnt it, now thats still about $300 cheaper than the custom shop fender, plus it is way way better in terms of build material, sound and personality; first of all I would name my guitar emrahcaster (lame yes, but its my guitar, I can name it anything I like can't I?) the drawbacks of building your own guitar could be the time being involved, the research you have to do, labor, waiting for parts to be produced which can take up to a couple of months in some cases, and the possibility that you don't like the end product (which would basicly be the fault of the wrong selection of parts and/or builders, not yours entirely) but in my opinion it definitely is worth taking the risk and imagine that the outcome is a beauty, I guess I would be as proud as I could be.
