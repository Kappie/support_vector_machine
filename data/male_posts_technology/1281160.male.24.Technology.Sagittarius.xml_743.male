So if anybody go to some historic temple, can u please take a snap of them and send me a copy too? I can bear the amount in printing, developing and couriering by sending u an M.O.  And ganesh, i need this help from u, yes, if u happen to go to Tarasuram, do visit Airateswarar temple. its a very beautiful one belonging to 12th century and its the same temple which i had mentioned in one of our earlier blog. Do get me snap of the Gajasamhara murthy and other idols if possible. Actually there is a museum in which they have got the photograph of such idols. If u could take a snap of it and send me i would M.O u the amount it costs. Since i dint carry a camera, i couldnot catch them. But i need them. so do it when u are free..... please!  Hei guys, u know what, i have cut my hair, yes, its no more longer as it was when i was doing M.S. so those who meet me next time, dont wonder at my new outlook!  bye for now Ranjini
