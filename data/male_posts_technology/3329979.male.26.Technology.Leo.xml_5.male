Then i realised : I'm only human, not Spider-Man :p  And so, my weekend began at 8:30 Friday nite when i left the office only to remember that i've left my access card in the office ! Dang ! A frantic search revealed Ms Sharon G in the vicinity of KLCC and i borrowed her access cards to retrieve mine. Thank you so much girl, u rock !  Sat turned out to be a pretty dull day as i spent most of it zzz. Hehe, the bakuteh at Klang didn't materialise which enabled me to sleep past my lunch time ;). Late afternoon brought some uncs and aunts over to my new place to visit my mum. Evening i was pretty for a nite out as i won a pair of tickets to the Heineken Green Room Music Festival at Bkt Kiara. Hey, they even threw in a complimentary can of beer. How cool is that ? Asha Gill was the MC for the evening; looking cool as ever. Caught a glimpse of her little tattoo on her left ankle. Haa ! Bet you guys didn't know that eh ? :p  Sunday was even more of a bore as i prepared some office work and napped in between. So, to make things a little interesting, i made some to-do-list for the next coming 12 months :  MY TO-DO-LIST : 1) To own a digital camera by Christmas 2004. 2) To own a DVD-ROM by August 2004. 3) To visit a foreign country (planning South America, hombres) by July 2005. 4) To be prepared for June 30th, 2005. 5) To update me blog on a more REGULAR basis (daily if possible :p)   Well, i'm outta here .... Happy reading :D  Savvy ;)
