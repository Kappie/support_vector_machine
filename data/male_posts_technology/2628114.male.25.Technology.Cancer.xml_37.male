Update for 4/23/04 I got to do a 30 minute run tonight in Franklin just before I watched our poor company softball team lose again.  I learned a couple things about Franklin and running in Franklin.  Apparently people in Franklin don't take too kindly to outsiders and runners, of which I was both.  With that said, there seemed to be no end to an odd stream rednecks in Mustangs yelling such pithy, original sayings as, "Run faster boy!" "Wanna lift, your going awful slow?" "Run Forest Run!" and the obligatory "Woohoo!" (yelled by redneck girls as they drove by).  These statements, combined with knee soreness that has escalated in my mind to "concerning, gave me a lesser view of two groups of people:  1) People from Franklin.  2) People in Mustangs.  (Sorry if anyone on this list fits into those categories, but you can blame the white trash that was yelling out their windows at me on Friday)  All in all, the run was good.  I monitored my knee pain/soreness throughout the run.  It didn't get worse but didn't get much better.  Most of Franklin was flat, but there is one hill and I took a random turn down a road to end up running up the worst part of it.  I say worst part, but the stairclimber training helped me to kick that hill's butt!
