Ion Sancho, supervisor of elections for Leon County, admits with shame that the state's felon purge in 2000 resulted in more than 50,000 legal voters being disenfranchised. The state elections division identified 47,000 more suspected felons, a list disproportionately heavy with blacks, and asked that local election supervisors purge them. The Bush people refused to make the list public, but were ordered to do so by a judge. Only then was it discovered that the list excluded felons who are Hispanic. In Florida Hispanics tend to vote Republican. This dandy error was 'absolutely unintentional,' the Bush people said - while abandoning the then indefensible list. Miami Herald columnist Jim Defede wrote that Hood - an 'amazing incompetent or the leader of a frightening conspiracy' - must resign. "
