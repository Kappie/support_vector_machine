First off, gummy bears... or gummy worms, or anything in the dysfunctional gummy family. I used to love them until I was about 13 or 14. Then the magic just stopped for me. It had less to do with gummy products being considered juvenile and more to do with the idea of putting one in my mouth made me nauseas. Even though I've gone through another taste bud "cycle" since then, the thought of gummy bears still makes me want to gag a skosh.  On the upside, a few months after I turned 20 I remember making the shocking discovery that I liked--nay--loved onions. I mean ridiculously and borderline inappropriately loved onions. Something that deep you think I would have been aware of before then.  Anyway, so I'm sold on the idea that one's personal tastes can change every so often and I exercise that belief by trying foods I know I don't like once in a while. The good news is, if I still hate them, I don't have to try again for another six or seven years. I'm holding out for the day where I suddenly love tuna or develop an isatiable urge to eat Easter Peeps.
