Abt the movie well it steals from the Ring and What Lies Beneath and there are like 2 scenes that scared me thats about it. And also the director keeps showing flashbacks to the past in the movie , but there is no indication they are flashbacks and i got confused sometimes whether i was watching a scene from the present or the past. Highly NOT recommended!
