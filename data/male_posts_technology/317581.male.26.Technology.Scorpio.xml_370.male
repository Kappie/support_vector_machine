Amorah got married, I got to dance with D at the wedding, Cory didn't get the job yet, I had an interview with another MS group, I finished "choke", I watched Blade 2, twice, and tonight I watched the Lord of the Rings again:) This time with the Two Towers Preview on the end:)  The LOTR:FOTR DVD info was released...  urlLink here   It's almost easter time, and I need to figure out what's going on. I think I might be going with Kevin, but he may have already left, dunno. I guess I'll find out in the morning.  The Two Towers looks INCREDIBLE. I am mostly looking forward to the riders of Rohan, as well as the Ents. Man oh man, I can hardly wait...
