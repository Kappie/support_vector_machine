While I can't personally fault Tenet for the intelligence failures in our country before and since 9/11/01, I do, however, hold him ultimately responsible.  It's his team (the CIA) that's done a fairly piss-poor job in intelligence gathering, and it is (and was) his responsibility to keep his house in order.  Maybe he could have fixed all the problems that weigh down his agency, maybe not.  I applaud him for stepping down, though, as this will hopefully become the catalyst which will spark the changes that need to be made at the CIA.  I want my dirty, greasy, slimy, questionably ethical agency back doing the things they  used  to do so well (before the cloud of political correctness started pissing on their offices).  Face it, people, dealing in the intelligence biz is a dirty, but necessary, business.  If they aren't getting dirty, they aren't doing their job.  I always had difficulty understanding how people can forgive the garbage man for smelling like garbage, but taking the CIA to task for doing  their  jobs.  In any event, I wish the man the best and sincerely hope we, the US of A, don't spend all our time trying to villify him.  Let's fix our problems and move on.
