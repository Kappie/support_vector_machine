Especially those damn 13 year old girls that have their own blog....Heres an entry from that exact demographic, from a girl that goes by "Sweet Princess", typical, isn't it?   wee going out later for father's day dinner..yipee...had a baddy stomachache..damn it..dunno wat i ate..(-_-)" hmm..tml i swear i am going to poa classes..skipped 3 lesson liao..cannot b like tis animore..hmm better not oversleep again..  haiz i decided to forgive phyllis..i must be like my heavenly father..learn to forgive n forget..love my enemies..hmm mayb tis is e best solution..tink positively..b a better gaL!! hmm..tis few days got chat wif phyllis..hmm happy..n glad..>  haiz gotta clear my table one of tis days..got so many junk CHINESE paper..c until headache!! k gtg now bb :P   Now please, tell me with a straight face, that the italicized text that you just read, didn't hurt your eyes/head, and that it wasn't the biggest peice of crap that you have ever laid eyes on. As far as I can gather, in that chicks fucked up mind, "tml" means "tomorrow"  and "wif" does indeed mean "with". I have no idea what the holy hell "poa" means, or "liao", although I think it may be Hawaiian. And it took me well over 3 minutes to decifer that "haiz" equals "hey's" which still isn't even a word. How sad is it when some dumb chick fucks up a word,  THAT ISN'T EVEN A REAL WORD!!  It's devestating to my remaining hope for humans.  This next part, is what this damn "Sweet Princess" wrote about herself in the About section of her blog:   My name is kelLY..everyone call mi kel..haha i like to play piano..surf net..daydreamz..act bitchy...eat lolipop (yummy)!! blahz blah as e list goes on..Eh..currently studying in marsiling sec (berri wu lu sch) haiz.. Results arrg!! HoRRIBLE Juz wanna Say Life suX..tt aLl   Simply amazing. And if anybody out there can figure out what exactly  currently studying in marsiling sec (berri wu lu sch) haiz..  means, I will pay you. I think I got the first three words, but after that the damn bitch kinda trails off into a language that looks like German. And with that, I concluded that this girl, as with most girls that spell "with" like a fucking 3 year old, is a  NAZI!!  Yes, you heard me right, the same goes for Hilary Duff, that god damn goose-stepping whore. I actually have proof that Hilary Duff is a Nazi, and that proof is in the following link.   urlLink http://subliminal.ytmnd.com/   hAvE i SaId ThAt AlTeRnAtInG cApS pIsS mE oFf?/!1  Kudos to Kevin Rose, and Sarah Lane, Hosts for the show The Screen Savers, as their blogs, kick ass and follow every rule in the book for making a blog the proper way.  I could keep this up, and go on a "Maddox-esque" rant about how people suck, but I'll leave that for later. Something I may do in the future, is make a collection of the crappiest blogs and/or websites, and post all the links on here for y'all to enjoy, and laugh at. Expect that to come in my next entry.  I have a small homework assignment for anyone out there who read this blog entry. If you've only read this sentance, please, take 10 seconds and e-mail me at  urlLink LeeDeaton@gmail.com . I just wanna get a feel for who my audience is for these.   Update:  I've discovered why young girls type the way they do! If you would notice, the word "wif" is said by 3 year olds who can't talk right, or by kids who don't have front teeth. And "tink" (supposed to be "think") is also said by either 3 year olds, or kids with no front teeth. And since you can't type wrong because you have no front teeth, I've come down to the conclusion that the majority of girls who type like "Sweet Princess" up there, are mentally 3 years old.   Another Update:  I can't possibly put into words the shittyness of this girls blog. You have to see this abomination for yourself.    urlLink http://gnettelovesgreentea.blogspot.com/
