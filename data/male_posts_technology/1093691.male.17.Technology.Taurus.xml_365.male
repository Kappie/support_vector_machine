What if this friend pushes away all the time, won't let anyone in? What if she won't speak to you, won't tell you anything, yet you thought you were her trusted best friend, just as you trusted her? What if she's changed so much you just don't know who she is, you don't understand her? But what do you do if you think this could turn out very badly for her? As in she might do something very stupid, but you can't talk to her, nor her family about it?   What do you do??????
