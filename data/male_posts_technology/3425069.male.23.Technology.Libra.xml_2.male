(disclaimer: this is not to indicate that the Liberal hold on Canada is in any way related to the grip of terror that the 9/11 terrorists held over the U.S, but instead to applaud the call to action of those brave heroes ~ if you thought this, then really, what is wrong with you ?!?)  More large signs go up tomorrow morning at 7 am for a copy of hours. After a 17 hour day today, that's pretty brutal, but that's life on the campaign trail. Good thing tomorrow is a Sunday, and therefore should mean a bit of a respite.  As the last little bit for today, I just have to say that there are some real sharp people working on the Gatten campaign. It should be quite a ride...
