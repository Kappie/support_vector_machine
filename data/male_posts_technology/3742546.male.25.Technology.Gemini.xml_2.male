Today I went to my sister's house to start her website for her.  I didn't get much done with it although I was there most of the day.  I had some struggles with globat's interface.  They don't support shell access and you I couldn't connect with an FTP client.  So, I had to use their integrated upload interface.  That gave me some troubles for a while.  But now I have a better understanding of how to get around.  The site itself is very crude right now.  I have to rearrange some things.  As for now, I'm going to work on some background images.
