To wit:  Donald Rumsfeld (via his official biography at www.whitehouse.gov):  Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Illinois in 1962, at the age of 30, and was re-elected in 1964, 1966, and 1968.   Mr. Rumsfeld resigned from Congress in 1969 during his fourth term to serve in the Nixon Administration as:   Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity, Assistant to the President, and a member of the President's Cabinet (1969-1970); and, as Counsellor to the President, Director of the Economic Stabilization Program, and a member of the President's Cabinet (1971-1972).   In 1973, he left Washington, DC, to serve as U.S. Ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Brussels, Belgium (1973-1974).   In August 1974, he was called back to Washington, DC, to serve in the Ford Administration successively as:   Chairman of the transition to the Presidency of Gerald R. Ford (1974);  Chief of Staff of the White House and a member of the President's Cabinet (1974-1975); and, as  The 13th U.S. Secretary of Defense, the youngest in the country's history (1975-1977).    Dick Cheney (via his official biography at www.whitehouse.gov):  His career in public service began in 1969 when he joined the Nixon Administration, serving in a number of positions at the Cost of Living Council, at the Office of Economic Opportunity, and within the White House.   When Gerald Ford assumed the Presidency in August 1974, Mr. Cheney served on the transition team and later as Deputy Assistant to the President. In November 1975, he was named Assistant to the President and White House Chief of Staff, a position he held throughout the remainder of the Ford Administration.   After he returned to his home state of Wyoming in 1977, Mr. Cheney was elected to serve as the state's sole Congressman in the U.S. House of Representatives. He was re-elected five times and elected by his colleagues to serve as Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee from 1981 to 1987. He was elected Chairman of the House Republican Conference in 1987 and elected House Minority Whip in 1988. During his tenure in the House, Mr. Cheney earned a reputation as a man of knowledge, character, and accessibility.    Richard Perle (via his AEI biography at www.aei.org:  Previously he served as Chairman of the Defense Policy Board (2001-2003);  Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy (1981-87); and served on the US Senate Staff (1969-1980).  [BTW--Perle's a registered Democrat, by his own admission].   Paul Wolfowitz (via his official biography at www.defenselink.mil):  Dr. Wolfowitz's previous government service included:   Two years as head of the State Department's Policy Planning Staff (1981-82); an earlier Pentagon tour as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Regional Programs (1977-80), where he helped create the force that later became the United States Central Command and initiated the Maritime Pre-positioning Ships, the backbone of the initial U.S. deployment twelve years later in Operation Desert Shield;  four years (1973-77) in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, working on the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and a number of nuclear nonproliferation issues; and a year as a Management Intern at the Bureau of the Budget (1966-67).  Dr. Wolfowitz taught previously at Yale (1970-73) and Johns Hopkins (1981).    Spin, I hope you aren't turning into one of those nutty conspiracy liberals (like those who write for The Nation, Maureen Dowd, or the prime quality champs at DemocraticUnderground.com).    Last I checked, the Democrats in 2000 bemoaned the fact that George W. Bush "wasn't qualified to be President."  So he surrounds himself with qualified people (elected members of Congress, administration officials, academics), and now the Democrats bemoan his being surrounded by qualified people.    Where is the Donkey's bipartisanship and pragmatism that they, today, so miss in their old punching bag, Ronald Reagan?  R.I.P. Ronald Reagan
