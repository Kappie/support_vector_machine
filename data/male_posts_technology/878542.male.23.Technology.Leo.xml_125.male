ANYTHING GOES!)      Until    the N.R.A.      ...    Reminded the populace about those pesky term limits.      And adding insult to injury    You no longer have creative control of your cameo on South Park... this is not good.      But now, after all that, you are    making a meagre living as a political satirist.      (How did you conquer?)     urlLink  Try "The World Is MINE!" MEME to find out!              Created with  urlLink   quill18  's  urlLink  MemeGen 2.0  !       Not a bad bit of prognostication. I've thought many time of starting an Unlimited Class of various sports, as I think it would be very interesting to see the absolute top performance possible, given every possible advantage. Kasparov and co. Vs. Ten networked Deep Fritz 3Ds! no rules battlebots! Steroidal Football(yeah, like it isn't already).   it would be interesting. the deaths would probably mount pretty quickly, but they did sign release forms. I mean, I can't be held responsible for what they do. Also, I imagine the police would enjoy arresting people who abused illegal methods to perfomance enhance within the United States quite a bit.  So be aware, it's not without problems.
