Many great preformances by many rookies but the two players that stood out were Jon Ryan who scored 23 of the 29 points the Blue scored. With a punting average of 53.5 yards on  8 punts including two thundering booms of 81 yards and 72 yards.  After missing his first field goal attempt from 35 yards he then went on to kicked field goals from 25, 27, 36, 44, 37 and 31 yards.     The second was Travis Ortega who had one interception and two fumble recoveries.  As for the quarterback situation  all qb's that played had an alright night Kevin Glenn had a shaky start having trouble getting into the groove but ended his day 5-14 with 61 yards , Brian Stallworth completed 4 of 9 for 56 yards  but the one that stood out the most was rookie quarterback Tom Denison who threw for four of six for 46 yards.  But even tho it is only the first pre-season and first game of the year the bombers offence still had some trouble scoring points.  With 9 turnovers they only scored one touchdown a one yard plunger by Chris Cvetkovich.    The Offence has alittle work to do in order to score when it counts but is coming along nicely.  The Defence has picked up exactly where it left off(before the playoffs) last year execpt this time around with  younger players.    After tonight at 11 pm (bomber time) the roster must be cut down to 50 players so look back tonight for a full report on who has been cut.  The next Bomber game is  June 10 at CanadInn Stadium against the B.C Lions kick off at 7:30 pm.  On an un-related note... R.I.P Ronald Reagan  Who passed away yesterday at the age of 93.    Ronald Reagan 1911-2004
