By the way, I'm quite impressed with MSN's audio conversation capabilities - apart from the inevitable lag, but I guess that's because I'm on dial-up as opposed to broadband.  So yes, I've talked to an ex-classmate in London and an old friend in Brunei in the space of 24 hours for basically nothing, which isn't too shabby. It's cooler today as well, which is a good start for the week!
