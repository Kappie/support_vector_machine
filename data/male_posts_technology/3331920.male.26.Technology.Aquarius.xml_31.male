And while i won't be wearing cloak or taped glasses, i'm pretty pumped.  It's been getting great reviews and all, but even if it wasn't i'm sure i'll love it.  Work was interesting today, got a new monitor and found out we're buying a farking warehouse-load of software on monday. Today was the first sunny day in a while, feels finally like summer's on the way.  Point Pleasant Park opened in Halifax today, and the Prime Minister wannabe Paul Martin was here to kick it off.  He also has stated that he's going to appeal to the immigration minister about that poor woman who has claimed sanctuary in the Halifax church.  I haven't really been following this case, but it's pretty intense, she's lived in there for over a year now, and was recently turned down by immigration Canada. We'll see what Martin can do, seeing as how there's an election and all, i'm sure he's feeling generous.  Enough rambling, bring on Harry Potter!  I'm out.
