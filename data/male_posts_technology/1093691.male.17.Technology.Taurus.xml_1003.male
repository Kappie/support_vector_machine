Yesterday luckily it wasn't busy at all and didn't have to open the front till too much. I got to put out the pic'a'mix yesterday with Charlene and Lora which was hilariously funny. You have no idea how much fun it is. LOL.  Today I'm on entertainment all day as Caroline is off on holiday. Should be ok.  Tomorrow I have to run into Croydon to get fabric for textiles and then I have to leave because mother is getting my Birthday things. Yayness. Wednesday I'm going to see Peter Pan with Ritchie. I will do something for my birthday with everyone but prob once we are back at college on an evening I know everyone is free. Took a trip last night up to the infamous addington estate. That is not an area you want to park the car in trust me...keep it moving. LOL. Dad was showing me some of the houses there. One of the houses is decorated with lights and whatnot. But tha front is covered, the back is covered, the side is covered and the roof is covered. And its soooo tacky!!! Have fun today!
