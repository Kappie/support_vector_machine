Visiting Tulum was one of the high-lights of my vacation in Mexico in February 2003. When we visited Tulum, it was toward the end of a hot afternoon.  The breeze off the Carribean was refreshing and we went for a swim in the small cove to cool off. The ocean side of Tulum is all a cliff except for the small cove which is a white-sand beach.  This configuration enabled the Mayans to repulse Cortez when he came along on his raiding mission.
