I had gone to the doctor not knowing or understanding why I felt sick all the time.  The doctor ran many tests and then he told me that I was to be a "MOMMY".  In fact, I am to be your mommy.  As soon as I left the doctor, I called your daddy.  Though very surprised, we are both very happy with your arrival into our lives.  However, it did not really seem real until we were able to see you for the first time.  The doctor had a difficult time keeping up with you, as you moved a lot.  At one point during the ultrasound, you even waved to us.  One of your first pictures shows you smiling.  Then about 5 weeks later, we got to see you again and hear your heartbeat.  That was absolutely incredible.  We even watched you turn over and look at us.  That is when we discovered that you were a boy.  I hope you don't mind, but we have decided to decorate your bedroom with puppy dogs.  My wish is that you will grow to be an avid animal lover.   It was shortly after that ultrasound that I was able to feel you move for the first time.  Your father and I were at a movie. Van Helsing.  Towards the end of the movie, I felt something move in my tummy.  I even turned to your dad and told him.  Then, I began to feel you more and more.  It seemed as though little bubbles or the last few kernals of a microwave popcorn bag were popping in me.  There was one time during the Queen's show at the Renaissance Faire (when I was suppose to be serious) that you began moving and it tickled me.  I couldn't help but smile.  I hope you grow to appreciate the small, the large and all the wonderful things in between in life.  I know that with you, I will learn so very much and will do my best to teach you all I know.  I love you Tristan.
