Once upon a time in a place called Madurai there was a campus where people used to study. (atleast... that was what they were supposed to do) ... And there were two little people called Hem and Haw... er... jax and kicha... who were soo proactive that they wanted to do a project that emobodies the future... And so their hunt began... In the meantime, they  understood the significance of XML standards and chose the XML-Signature as their project... or rather, an implementation of XML-Signature using C#...   it was with great difficulty and hard work that they completed the project...   after all, searching in google ain't that easy... ;-))
