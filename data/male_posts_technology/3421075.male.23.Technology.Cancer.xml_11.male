It is listed as originating from the Guardian but I'm sure I've also heard it on a BBC Radio 4 programme - Puzzle Corner I think.  A 14 digit number is to be constructed in the following way.   It starts with the digit 4 and ends with the digit 3.   It contains two 7's, separated by 7 digits, two 6's, separated by 6 digits, etc.  What is the number??
