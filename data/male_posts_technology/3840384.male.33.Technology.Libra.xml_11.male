Tammy is over ten years old and Chelsea is almost ten. They have been around since before I moved to Seattle. Feeling philsophical, and I realized that one day they will be gone. What the hell will I do then?  I have "Life in General" playing, and the song "Change" is resonating with me. The approximate lyrics, below....    House of wonder, house of pain Looking out for all the things that I have tried to rearrange Boiling water, burning sun Holding onto memories of everything that I've ever done  Change is coming and change is good,  It's done everything that I ever wished it would But it keeps me awake at night.  Worn-out shoe soles, hurting pride,  Making sense of all the places that I've been on the inside Hands are hurting, waking nights Now I wonder why I ever wanted to start this fight  Change is coming and change is good It's done everything that I've ever understood But it stands so tall, it walks so strong, It's taking over me Change is coming and change is good It's done everything that I ever wished it would But it keeps me awake at night.  And red-orange leaves fall into love Watching as the wind fills the wings of my very own turtledove  Change is coming and change is good It's done everything that I ever wished it would But it stands so tall, it walks so strong It's taking over me Change is coming and change is good It's done everything that I ever wished it would But it keeps me awake at night. Yes it keeps me awake at night.   So why does it seem like the right song right now? Well, I guess change is coming, though not sure yet from where. I'll have to try and figure that out. Its not exactly feeling depressed but certainly its reflective...  In the meantime, its a relaxing day off. The groceries were delivered and there are plenty of non-work items to keep me busy. What else could someone ask for?
