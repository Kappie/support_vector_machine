I've just signed up to  urlLink BraveNet  as they do polls with added image goodness. With any luck you should see the results in the sidebar.  I was going to put the poll directly in the post but Blogger doesn't seem to allow Javascript in main posts anymore. Shizzle.   EDIT:  It seems that even though it complains about the Javascript in the post it still allows it. Yay!  This poll is now closed - results  urlLink here .
