I am sitting on the floor, fingers on lappie, listening to "Ai Yi Ge Ren Hao Nan - William So" and i typed (upon recent encounters)  - "........Classic case of wrong timing or should I just submit to my fate?"  In life, things don't just operate like clockwork.  In certain point in time, one would have to make a decision. Decision-making involves implication in later stages which is yet to be delineated. In this point in time in my life, i would say the year of 2004 is really full of suprises. Surprises i expected, surprises i least expected and surprises that aren't surprises.  To a certain extent, i do believe that Heaven is fair. What justifies me in saying that? Humans have short/long comings. So one can be good in something, but somehow at some other arena, it stand seconds.  After 2.5years overseas, besides the paper i've gotten, there are so many valuable lessons that i've learnt. Lessons which can't be learnt in lecs/tutes. That's lessons in life. There is no training doctrine for it. Everyone's encounter is different, thus different TSR. No one can never say "Hey. how come your life and my life is so similar one har?"  Crap!  When approaching a Y-junction, its inevitable that a decision has to be made. One can't possibly revert back to the original settings when he/she made the wrong decision. Life Archictecture doesn't work in that manner. You live the decision u've made and make the best out of it, build on the fact that u do not know what lies ahead.  Life may seem simple, but it would be worthwhile if u inject some challenges in it.. Hmmm this thought just came in.  Till date, this bloke has sent out 30+ job applications. Dejected? no. Dis-heartened? No. I shall hold on. 95% of the jobs requires the Vitamin E, which i am lacking. "..bla bla.. u r too highly qualified,but we are looking for pple with more working experience". If all jobs requires job experience,  THEN WHO THE #$%^*#$% going to give Fresh Graduate  a chance????!!!   Singapore's getting too stagnant. It's time to jump-ship!  Today's sunday. going to wash 3051 later.  Hai... i miss my best friend in Melbourne.  Laterz, Unilodge on Flinders
