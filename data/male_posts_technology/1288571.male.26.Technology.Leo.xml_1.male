I picked it up for $50 - what a steal!  Exact same mouse as the mx700 except its not wireless.. big whoopty fucking doo!  This mouse is quality.  I am now happy.  On another note, I'm even MORE happy because I picked up Zelda for Gamecube today!!! I haven't had much time to play it but suffice it to say that it ownz me, you and your mom.  I'll be having a serious go at it tonite.  In the meantime, back to the grindstone...
