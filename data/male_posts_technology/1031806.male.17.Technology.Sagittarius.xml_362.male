Friday... I got to the last day of school at the beginning of the LAST PERIOD... I had set my phone (my suto-alarmclock) on vibrate the night before for my sister's 8th grade grduation, so when it went off to wake me up, it well... vibrated. My parents apparenly didn't see the wisdom in actually venturing into my room untill close to noon, but rather, repeatedly called my phone, which again, was on vibrate. When I got to school, I handed in a project and took a test, neither of which were for the class that I had that period... and spent the rest of the time walking around school with my video camera.  Later that night was Faith's Senior Graduation. As is my custom, I videotaped that in its entirety as well. I'm thinking about encoding it in divx and pushing it out onto Kazaa via my neighbor's connection... Might eventually get around to it, might not too...  Anyway, after the graduation, I went home, spent time doing... something, dunno what but in any event I spent quite a while doing it... packed up my computer and finally arrived at the first of 8 or so graduation parties I would be attending from then till Sunday night (Jon-Mark's) at around midnight. Yeah, that was great fun :) Many hours of watching random videos and tv shows, all off my computer, through the night. Mel was funny, every little while she thought she was leaving... in a little while, but eventually she just ended up staying the entire night with us.  I went back to my house, or at least I think I went back to my house... not really sure... whatever, in any event, Jon-Mark, Darren and I went to several more grad parties on Sat, ending up at Eric Zoucha's that night... I had had no sleep for over 30 hours by this time and had been driving them around most of the day while they slept (lol) So it's completely understandable that I fell into a coma-like sleep on Eric's chair... and could not be wakened by any means whatsoever... well, understandable when you know that other time that I've fallen asleep like that, I've been shot with bb guns at point-blank and not waken up.  Anyway, they got a ride home with their dad, and I woke up past midnight at Eric's... I should have just stayed there, but I went back home. Many of us met up again at parties later Sunday, but I missed the one at their church that I wanted to go to.  That pretty much raps up the graduation weekend... on to more events of the week in further posts.
