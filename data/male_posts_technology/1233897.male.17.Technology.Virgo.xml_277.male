It was a parody of the parable of the talents, everyone was supposed to invest the ten dollars in whatever way they could think of and then turn in the proceeds in three weeks (last week). All the money gained on top of the $17,000 would go to help AIDs victims in Africa. People were very creative, ideas carried out ranged from selling flowers on freeway onramps to opening a sushi bar at school to making collector's mailboxes out of model trains. As of the final count yesterday, they had received $39,395 back, and there's much more coming in. I'm thinking that I might start attending BCC on a regular basis; I'll pray about it and see where God leads...  Oh, btw, this church is by no means small... they can fit more people on their  stage  than Calvary has ever had in their entire auditorium... (LOL)
