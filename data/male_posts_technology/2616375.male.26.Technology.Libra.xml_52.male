Logically, there should be a way to access any newsgroup given NNTP is an standard and a very old protocol (giving enough time for implementation by various vendors). A little digging and here are the results of the same:  Lotus Notes 5 has support for accessing newsgroups. Earlier versions of Lotus seems to have only support for newsgroups hosted on Domino servers..   I found information at  urlLink The only information that you really have to enter is a friendly account name, which you determine for your own use, plus the server name (msnews.microsoft.com) and a protocol -- in this case, NNTP. Then, you save the account document and Notes adds a bookmark to your client. With Notes R5, the former Notes workspace is replaced by bookmarks, which provide a much faster way for getting to and managing information on desktops and the Internet. Once you click on your new NNTP bookmark, you can select from a list of newsgroups published by the server administrator, and you're on!  urlLink
