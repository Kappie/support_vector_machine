 I picked up some "Veggie" brand soy cheddar substitute and ate it with Ritz crackers.  The mozzerella is much better than the cheddar.  I had probably more crackers than I should have, and I'm getting the usual response to eating; bloating and belching. 

  Update:  I've been snacking on Sweedish Fish candy for a few minutes, on top of the crackers and cheese.  Ofcourse its a bad idea, but I don't much care tonight.  I'm just upset about having to leave class early again this evening.  The bloating and belching is continuing, with a low level of nausea.

 Bowel movement at 10:45 pm.  Small and broke apart easily.  Slightly greasy.  My gut feels a little better after moving that, but as usual there is always a hollow feeling afterwards, and it seems like my intestines rush to catch up.
