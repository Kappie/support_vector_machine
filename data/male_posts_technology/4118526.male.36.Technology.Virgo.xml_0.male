We have two gargoyles here that love to do the power play thing and kiss up and horn in and steal everyone else's glory so that they seem as if they walk on water and the rest, well, we are all just garbage.  It is a shame.  I prefer to be low key and just do my job behind the scenes.  Remember me on pay day and at evaluation time.  I used to have management dreams but it seems one has to sell pieces of their very soul to be in management at times.  Is there no such thing as ethical and management in the same breath?  I supposed there is.  I know some managers for whom I have a great deal of respect.  There there are the bone headed ones who make decisions with out really giving it any thought.  So much has changed here.  I miss the family atmosphere.  I miss the team effort.  I have survived many management changes and with some exceptions I have been here longer than most managers.  So I will probably survive this one as well.
