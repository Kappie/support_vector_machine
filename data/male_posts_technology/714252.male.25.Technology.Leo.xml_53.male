To Quote Jonny talking to Karl "You didn't complain last night!") I think we all know what that means :)  The guys are just getting up while I get to bed (and might I say Karl is wearing rather "funky" leopard skin underwear.. GWAN, you know you want to picture it ;P)  Anyway, last night I was in Salsa quite happy to be doing intermediate and finaly feeling like I might actually be getting the hang of it when I get bumped up to bloody advanced.. GOD-DAMNIT! I have to say it was kinda fun but really REALLY bad..  Then on to the POD to see Bubs, Richie and the Americans.. And then it happened.. The official sign of the end of the world.. The true sign that the end is near.. Richie. Got. Some. Must say though, the four horsemen are decent enough chaps once you get chatting to them.. Deaths a bastard when it comes to a hand of poker though. The little fuck has no eyes so bluffing comes easy..  Anywho, I also had a very nice night.. Julie has to be the STRANGEST most STUBORN American ever to be put on gods green earth.. We were in the POD and she got stuck because POD needs ID with credit cards and she had none on her, so I lent her the difference and told her to give it back to me Monday.. She freaked out a little bit and decided that she HAD to give me back the money tonight or she would have it hanging over her all weekend. Not only that but she insisted on coming out to me to give it to me.. (The MONEY Bubbles, The MONEY)  Interlude, Jonny talking to Karl; get the fuck out of the fucking way you fucking fuck.. the hotest couple in town have just left together for work.. So sweet...  Anywho, back to the main event. So Julie heads home from the POD and then her and Pete (Nice guy, refused to let her walk on her own) head out here, but being the Yanks they are they take the most FUCKED UP SKANKY ASS LOST ROUTE imaginable.. They actually ended walking back into town from Donnybrook to get to my flat and didn't realised how far wrong they had gone wrong... I wander down to meet Julie on the way and Pete has disappeared by the time I get there (Told you, Nice guy) He phoned me before heading off to make sure I met up with her and knew where she was.   Anyway, Me and Julie come back to my place and come into the sitting room to see Karl lying in a way that looks like he is humping the blanket.. I also think he MAY have been hanging out.. Either that or it was a long pubic hair.. god only knows..  Spend a while here relaxing (No.. I didn't "Bone the Bitch" Bubbles) and then we realise she is late for getting to her bus for the airport..Mad dash to get her home and to the bus and I still amn't sure if she made it or not... Ah well.. Shit happens.. (Especially when you know Bubbles.. Strange that)  K, It is 7:40AM and I STILL haven't been to bed.. Bubbles, please leave phoning me till after 3 if you can you sick demented twisted fuck (see I even complimented you)  Wow.. Long blog for a change..  Oh yeah, one other thing.. Turns out I am being sent to the wilds of Cork for a Salsa thing! /me is being trusted to hand out flyers in Cork at a salsa festival.. I feel so wanted..  K.. Sleep Must go to now..  echo off cls :top Echo "Zzzzzzzzzzz" Goto top  Wow, now I KNOW I am tired.. Geekdome awaits!  K you can all fuck off now, I need some sleep and you need to go do your own fucking blogs bitches...  And you all have small cocks (except the girls who would probably be happy just to see a small cock..)  Hmmm maybe that last comment was too much to soon, we hardly know each other.. Ah fuck it  Go away
