You'd think Microsoft, the richest corporation in the world, could afford some decent production values. This show, about VB, has a laugh track.  In  urlLink this episode , there is a VB rapper, singing about VB.NET and web services. I've died and gone to hell. "Because I'm object-oriented and I'm on the net!" Ugh.
