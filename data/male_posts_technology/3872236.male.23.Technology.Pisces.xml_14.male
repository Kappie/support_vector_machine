I'am listening a mix of Paul Oakenfold, I don't know the name of the album but it's very calming.  Tomorrow, it's my mother's birthday, the photo album is nearly finished.  I'm in holydays until the 13th september. I still have a month to do nothing, it's pleasant.  I will brush my teeth, see you later...
