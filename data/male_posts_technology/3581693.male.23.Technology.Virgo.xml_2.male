Well it's quite simple really - back in December of 2000 when she came into my posession - I wanted to call her the Silver Bullet.  Well that name was already taken by J. Salon's Toyota Minivan - so I had to come up with something else.  So I got to thinkin'... hmmmmmm ...   The Silver Bullet...  The Silver Bullet Band  Bob Segar and the Silver Bullet Band  Simply shortened to ... Bob.  And there you have it - her name is Bob.
