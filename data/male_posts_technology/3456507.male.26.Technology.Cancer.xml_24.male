Intel Desktop Control Center enables you to perform stress tests to verify system stability and to conduct performance testing to measure the impact of system configuration changes. The easy-to-read system gauges provide feedback so you can observe the effects of various system modifications in real-time.  This easy-to-use console dynamically displays temperatures, speed, and usage percentages, allowing you to verify system stability and check performance gains without rebooting into the BIOS. And once you have tuned the system to your liking, the settings can be stored as presets so you can quicly shift gears between "quiet operation" and "gaming mode".    http://fileforum.betanews.com/detail/1067420648/1  Thanks, Team SomeBuddies.com
