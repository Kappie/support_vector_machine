President George W Bush's administration said the deficit, which is 50 percent bigger than that projected just five months ago, had been exacerbated by a weak economy, the Iraq war and a $350 billion tax cut package.   The U.S. annual deficit is now $1,350 for each man, woman and child in the United States. That's how much money the government has to borrow each year just to run its day-to-day business.  The U.S.  urlLink federal debt  is now $6,735,127,561,642.54. Holy crap - that's a lot of commas. That's $19,243 for each man, woman and child.
