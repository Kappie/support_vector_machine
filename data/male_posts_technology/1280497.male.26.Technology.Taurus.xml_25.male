The article is about the media phenomenon known as "trendspotting", where a reporter finds what he/she thinks is a trend, and then goes out to find more facts that confirm the existence of this trend.  I like the way the article analyzes the culture, and I like the fact that the reporter is doing his own "trendspotting" article by writing about trendspotting. How circular.
