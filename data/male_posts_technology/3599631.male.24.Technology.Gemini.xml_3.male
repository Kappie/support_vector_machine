I was born in the year of the Monkey and am a Gemini (at least, according to my  urlLink Blogger profile ). I live in western Massachusetts, which is located in the northeastern United States, which is located in the western hemisphere, which is located on the third planet from the sun, which is somewhere in a vast amount of void and matter known as the universe. You may have heard of it, you may not. I make no claims of knowing my audience.  I work with computers. I'm an IT administrator for a small business in Connecticut (somewhat south of that whole Massachusetts thing). My day to day involves managing several different servers of various operating systems. Going down the line, I have two running Windows 2000 Server, two running Mac OS X Server, one running Linux, and one running FreeBSD. I like to consider myself an equal opportunity OS employer. However, I honestly don't like Windows. I'd say I don't like Microsoft at all, but I have an Xbox and I have to admit it's a pretty good gaming system.  My true passion is for the Macintosh. While I would never have said such as recently as four years ago, in September of 2001 I bought my first Mac and I haven't looked back. I sometimes joke that Macs never existed before OS X, but I know that's not true. For example, I have an original Macintosh that has been hollowed out for use as a fish tank. There aren't any fish in it, mind you, because I can't seem to keep anything besides myself alive. I fear for my children, wherever they might be. Just kidding, I don't have any offspring. I think many people are thankful for that.  No, switching to the Mac was probably the smartest thing I've ever done. If I hadn't, I wouldn't have my current job, I wouldn't have written any  urlLink articles  for  urlLink O'Reilly , and I wouldn't be typing this on a beautiful 17" Apple Studio Display. I think I've taken the whole Mac thing to an extreme though. I've become quite a hypocrite, but also quite an evangelist. I love to be proved wrong and for every bad thing I've said about Apple in the past, I'm sure I've said at least two good things about the Mac maker. And I have plenty more good things to say about Apple, the Mac, and other technology stuff, so stay tuned.
