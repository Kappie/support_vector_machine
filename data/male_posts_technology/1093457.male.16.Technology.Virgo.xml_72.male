I had a crap day today and can't be bothered to moan about it right now.  I made someone happy today. That is something I am trying to do each day. I will be sending a video to a girl in Brazil. She can't get programs which Ryan Merriemn is in there so I am recording Taken for her so she can watch it. Shes now really happy. And these are some of the reasons why I wish to go to Antartica on a cruise:  urlLink 001   urlLink 002   urlLink 003   urlLink 004   urlLink 005   urlLink 006   urlLink 007
