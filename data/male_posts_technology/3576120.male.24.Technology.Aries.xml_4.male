The movie is a brilliant collaboration of filmmaking that captures the imagination of your everyday comic book fan boy and transports him off to that fantastic childhood world of neverland. (Not the Michael Jackson one which should really be called molest land)  From the opening get go of the movie, the crowd took what would be a big excited inhale of air and never thought about releasing it until the multiple orgasmic climatic ending was over.  (Imagine that as a tagline: This movie is one Multiple orgasmic joyride to the very end.  HA! )  I can honestly say that I enjoyed every last minute of it and I was simply a jittering mess when the whole things was said and done.  The filmmakers did a masterful job in expanding on the first film with supped up special effects and a concrete script that could leave any comic book writer jealous.  I have to give two thumbs up to Sam Raimi, who over the course of the movie flexed his superior directing muscle with elaborate fight scenes and very versatile scenes of emotion that brings the viewer ever so closer to the heart of the characters.  Sammy (as I like to call him) also introduced a small portion of himself to the mainstream audience with his well-known Evil Dead esque film style, with a scene that left the everyday Jo schomo trimbling at bay.  (We will just say that Doc Ock with a Chainsaw was quite possibly the most horrific but enjoyable scene of all.)  Tobey Magiure was fantastic with his pectoral muscles of steel….. uggghhhhh! Wait… he was just super… forget that pectoral thing.  Kirsten Dunst showed a nice versatile range of acting while at the same time fulfilling every fan boy's imagination of MJ, and leaving them with a wonderful creamy sensation of fun in there pants.  Yes, this movie was all that and a bag of chips on top.  Webslinging fun at immense proportions that lefts the viewer to a level of readiness for a sequel.  The most impressive element of this movie, was the fluid nature in which the camera was able to capture the scene of action.  The flow was seamless as well as inventive in a nature that allowed the viewer to feel as though they were actually reading a Spiderman comic (a.k.a. graphic novel for those who wish to call it that) I give this movie four and three quarter stars our of five.  So after the movie was over and I finished vibrating from excitement like a giant sized motorized dildo, I proceeded over to Wal-Mart with a few friends.  Oh how I feel sorry for them, because I was blabbering on like a little girl in an ice cream shop.  Spiderman this and Spiderman that.  And on this journey of a drunken ecstasy high of adrenaline, I proceed to by the Spiderman 2 video game, which is out now for the PS2. (See that little advertisement…. I will be expecting a residual check anytime now…. Or at least a free product… I mean come on…) Anyway, if the movie is anywhere near as exciting an fun as the movie was, I will never have to masturbate again.  Ahhhhhh… the joy….  Meanwhile at work: I have discovered that there is this extremely disgusting thing that little girls like to call hair gel.  Yes this stuff is sick and just be glad you have never had the pleasure of picking up a pair of headphones that has this shit all over it.  I mean come on, this stuff gets everywhere, I have once encountered a puddle of it on the back of a chair and yes, it looks like someone jizzed all over the top of the chair.  It's gross as hell.  I bet you that if I were to throw a match in the vicinity of one of these girls that they would probably burst into flames..  Could you imagine, one little girl running around screaming with fire on the top of her head, while ambers from the fire set other girls hair on fire?  It would be like a mini bond fire…. I could bring some Oscar Myers wieners to make.  (I like my human barbecued)  Seriously though, I don't know how they will make it through the July fourth weekend.  (Officer Sanchez, we have a group of children on fire, please respond)  Anyway, the other thing I have learned about working at a school is that sometimes when a teacher (who you don't like) goes on holiday, and is gone for a few days, it is really easy to hope and pray that someone has popped a cap in her ass.  This is mean to say, but I really wish there was a duck tape law in which, if a teacher is being a mega bi'otch, that you can duck tape her sorry ass up and dump her off the nearest bridge.  Could you imagine?  Literally I have to admit that when this teacher talks, I just want to vomit acid into her face like I was an alien.  (Think about that scene in stand by me when everyone is vomiting on each other.)  A Niagara level of vomiting fun.  Okay, I'm sorry, I just went too far….. Or did I?… huh….. At this moment I will take a moment to spout my disclaimer.  This journal is an expression of free speech.  It is also a depiction of my thoughts and emotions at the time I am venting.  It is a no hold bars affair and if my profanity or opinions offend you, then get the fuck out.  Now that is said and done….. I am really not a bad person….  I just want a place where my thoughts are not censored by society.  Sometimes the emotions I depict are just for a moment and I use them for comedic value.  So if you are reading this, that how this journal at all times should be taken…. Oh well.. That it for now… Take it easy until next time….
