Well, maybe not anymore--but there was, until  urlLink Facing Windows  found it. I'm not going to say any more because it's one of the film's little secrets, the central mystery. The Reich connection is slowly hinted at, nudged into your consciousness. At times I thought I had a leg up on the movie, like I'd won the battle of wits. And that's true, to a point. It's really great work, giving you this info early enough on that it sits there at the back of your mind, stewing enough that it almost seems familiar. Then, just when you're comfortable with it, in comes the obligatory twist. It's not shocking the way The Crying Game is shocking, it's more of a tragic, drawn-out moment. The results are, well, kick ass.   You may have guessed, I thought the movie was brilliantly written. The story is content to draw you along at it's own pace, gradually revealing the mysteries of four lives that become entangled when an unhappily married couple stops to help a senile old man who can't remember anything about himself. One of the few screenplays in a long time that has made me absolutely sick with envy.  And it's Italian, so be prepared to read.
