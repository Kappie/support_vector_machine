Others never really caught my eye enough to watch them.  There was one episode of Matlock, however, that I recorded when I was 18, because my girlfriend at the time was in the background in a bikini!  Remember Michele Basye all you Lee Davis Alumni?  It was filmed at Va. Beach on a day that her family happened to be there.  Ahh memories... Anyway, feelin any better Angie?
