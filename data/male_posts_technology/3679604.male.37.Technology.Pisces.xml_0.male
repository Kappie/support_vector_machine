Alhamdo lillah (Thank the Lord), we have had great rain in Dallas past month or so and it feels so good compared to many of the hot summer days we normally have here.  It makes my air conditioning in my office work a lot better :)  And many days it rains part of the day and becomes sunny rest of the day to reveal a very moderate temperature for the rest of the day, like yesterday.  Went jogging in evening and it was like in the mid 70s my gawd it was great!    But we may pay for it in August!!!  Oh well, I'll take it when I can get it!  No tubing yet, no vacation yet, nothing happening on that front...just normal stuff happening....-Mustafa
