It reeks of machonism without any reason what so ever (i.e. the people here just WANT to bleed, sweat and die for their country), has a foul sense of what's decent bedtiems (getting up at six in the morning and going to bed at elleven), and finally it is boring.  We did get our AG3's handed out yesterday, so I'm running around with a bad ass gun. Not really cool. What IS interesting is the mechanic principles in the trigger section as well as the composites used to make it. Pertty nifty to study and take apart. I can just about demantle it in forty seconds now and I really couldn't care less. I mean, WTF????????????  All the kids learn what a bullet looks like, what gunpowder is, safekeeping of the gun, etc. Pretty boring as my dad brought me up with a rather good sense of proper weapon care and handling. What was funny though was when Andre forgot to lock his locker. I took his AG3 and put it into mine to teach him a lesson and get him to never forget locking his locker. Man, I got so scared. His whole face went winter--white-pale when he realized and he stood there frozen a good ten seconds before he stormed of to the troop chief. Fortunatly I did get hold of him and told him about the prank We all had a really good laugh and still, five hours later, he's still shaking. HAHAHAHA.  That's it for now. MidnightHacker, hate you. I'll still give you a phone somtime.  ciao boys, svenni
