I remarked to him that blogs (especially community blogs, which I wish I could make this one open for everyone to post) are a bit like MUSHing, MUDing and the like.  Confined (usually) to a topic.  A sense of belonging.  Text-driven (I realize there are photo blogs out there).  So I got to thinking about my MUSHing days (10 years ago!) on PernMUSH, Belior Rising, the toocool, yet doomed  urlLink Desert Wings MUSH  (hey it was 1996!).  I still have some TinyMUSH code on my computer.  Don't have my random poetry generator though.  Tres sad.  Anyway.  No point really.  I am just starting to get reaquainted with the Internet on a social level.  And surprise, surprise...  everything is different, yet the same.  So welcome to the world of multi-user shared hallucinations!  Or what Oscar Wilde might have termed, Bunburying.  Cause while this is me typing, the online me is a little bit different than the RL me.  @set me=@whee!
