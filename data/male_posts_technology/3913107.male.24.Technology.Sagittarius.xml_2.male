Whenever i see anyone who is of able age and is (probably) poor ,I feel ashamed of myself ! Now here i mean ,There are so many people who are deprived of good food ,Clothes, brands,car,and all such luxury item. When I see a boy working in a hotel or a garage ,and me a the  luxurious  end - I feel  WHY am I the chosen one  ! This question is really haunting me and i cant neglect it too . Earlier when i was ignorant,I used to go for karma philosophy. May be his bad karmas are reflecting in the state he is in right now.But No.This is utter ignorance. I am satisfying my self with answers which are meant to satisfy me. Tell me - why is the empathy of mine haunting me. I feel like doing something for them... At the same time I turn out to be very selfish.I see around and am happy wih my parents/friends .I dont want to loose them ! Even if the garage boy or waiter asks me to do so... Actyually i am lost...
