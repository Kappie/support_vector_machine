There is a section of carpet in my room which STRONGLY smells of cheese, its awful. So, I went downstairs and under the sink was this Febreeze stuff (u must of heard of it on TV), so I thought I would give it a try. I sprayed it on, and the smell has gone all round the house. I now have a headache because of the strong Febreeze smell. I HAVE TO SLEEP WITH IT TONIGHT, ITS RIGHT BY MY BED :@ I would need Nic in bed with me to take my mind off it :D  Talking of Nic...   :D  P.S: That first picture of nic is the desktop background on my laptop :D
