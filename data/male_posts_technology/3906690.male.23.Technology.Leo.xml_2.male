We watched a video on all potential hazards H2S has to offer. Afterwards we trained as if we were in an environment which the SCBA was needed. We all had to use proper steps.  Otherwise, the H2S would get into our system and do what it does best, KILL. The maximum a person can take in(H2S) before he/she falls dead is at 600 ppm's. Anything below could still cause death, but at 600 ppm's you fall dead in your tracks. Around here, the maximum ppm's is 10 ppm's. We have to evacuate our work area when our monitors read/beep at 10 ppm's. Even at this level you can lose your sense of smell, etc. Anyhow I passed all given tests on Friday morning, oh and the required SCBA test as well.  For the past couple of days, we had to do clean up work. We were supposed to do a fiber glass line, but that went to another crew. So the crew I was in did more clean up work, mostly back-hoe work. I guess what happened is Elkhorn shut down their facilities. When they did this, all natural gas produced on Ratherford leases(ExxonMobil) had no where else to go except back into where they came from along with newly produced gas. This pressurized Batteries and satellites. Through this, all incoming chemicals/fluids produced from a pumping unit have no where else to send their fluids, so fluids in these batteries/satellites pressure to their maximum capacity. When this happens, flowlines rupture, seals and gaskets expand and tear, overflow tanks and fractanks overflow, and so on. Lots of pressure, thousands of lbs of pressure. I believe the maximum rating within most facilities out here are set at 10,000 lbs per square inch, according to Quadco's pressure testing.  Anywho, I worked four hours today, Saturday. I was watching "Starsky and Hutch" and the "Birdman" came around, "Do you wanna put in some hours?" I said "sure." We were at Battery 19 for those four or so hours. Sort of kicking back, and cleaning the separators. *L* Cleaning these separators suck, mainly because we have to harness up. Whenever we work above 6 feet off the ground, it's required we wear harnesses. So that was pretty much it, clean up oil stain on the separators and shut in VRUs, ventilator release units’, valves.  Hmm...my sickness has been getting better by the day, as I am writing this entry I'm feeling great, well aside from a few *coughs* here and there. About a month or so I caught pneumonia, and it was sickening. I was told that this sickness can be easily obtained again once you have had it, especially if one is exposed to the cold for a period of time. I'm not sure how this could have been, because it's hot as hell out here. I'm thinking it’s maybe the constant sweating on the job, along with cool breezes every now and then...and maybe a mixture of H2S. I've been working at Area 4 for the past couple days, and that's H2S central, well partially.  I don't know? It seems my throat has been...jacked lately. I think It's something more than a common cold, or pneumonia or whatever. I'm thinking it's something more "hardcore," I don't want to say...but every time I come into contact with smoke or like for instant a small amount of H2S out in the field my oxygen intake feels limited. My throat starts itching and whatnot. I try to cough whatever it is that's making this itch, most of the time it's nothing, then I start with the coughing again. It's weird. Hopefully it goes away soon...  ...It's dark once again. Last night, or rather early this morning I had a Nightwalker experience. Nightwalker meaning...uhh, skinwalker and such. Yea, it was freaky. Honestly, I'm somewhat scared of what tonight will bring me. Last time I had an experience like this was...2 years ago or so. That time I actually saw a dark figure standing over me, mumbling jibberish I couldn't understand. Yup...*shrugs* all I can say is.."Can’t ya'll fuck with someone else?" I wrote this piece after my last experience with these...creatures...persons...whatever they were at that moment. It goes like this...  *SKINWALKER* Creature of the darkness living to kill dwelling on the innocent brainwashing the mind claiming what you think is yours all the envy inside you haunting human targets using the prayer of hatred out for blood loyal to evil so hypnotic no one knowing what a killer looks like im caged in a rage take one take two brainwashed into burning blood bleeding for days living to die dying to live inside my soul I wont back down cant get you off my mind slowly rotting away the difference so close to me these streaks of blood the beast of modern death whats on your mind you got me to hell and back ive been im trapped in a dream flying in this blue delusion blue light turning red in the end your dead to us all I now awake Copyright  2004 SJohnson
