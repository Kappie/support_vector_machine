Been working on a major customer for a few days and it has been driving me MAD trying to get the site closed.. Still have a few pieces to do but everything that is left is on their side now..  On site tomorrow and then I think I might see if I can organise a long weekend sometime soon.. (although I may just wait till the end of July.. I have my yearly week off for my Birthday then! 28/07 if anyone happens to be reading and caring at the same time ;P)  I think I have done all the tweaking I am going to do on the main site (for now) and I have to say I am really pleased with the way it turned out.. doesn't integrate the best with the blogs, but tbh I think I may just write my own blog engine if the site warrants it.. I don't think it will tho and this does fine for me :)  If you haven't seen Jonnys tribute page (created by a long time fan of my flatmate Jonny) then go to The .Bar main site and check out the links section.. FUNNEH!  K, going to bed now.. need sleep.. up in 5.30 hours.. must be mad.. actually, know I am mad, I am sitting here wibbling on at 2.02AM when I could be in bed sleeping already...  Stop typing Michael  DISCONNECT  It's only da Interweb.. Let it go.. GO TO BED...  heh.. Mad? Me?
