Opera has made an entry into the mobile server market by releasing "Opera Mobile Accelerator", a proxy based server solution that optimizes the data transfer and content for the mobile phones.   After having redefined the mobile Internet experience on handsets with innovations like Small-Screen Rendering, Content Magic and Tags, Opera Software today introduced the latest tool for empowering users to get the most out of their handsets: Opera Mobile Accelerator, a new proxy-based solution that increases rendering speed on mobile devices up to 250%. Opera Mobile Accelerator also reduces the amount of transferred data traffic - thereby drastically reducing users' telecom bill.  Opera Mobile Accelerator entails that all requested Internet traffic passes through an Opera server, where the Web pages are compressed, stripping out all unnecessary elements before they are downloaded to the handset.  "For Opera, extreme speed has always been treated as essential for a good Internet experience," says Jon S. von Tetzchner, CEO, Opera Software. "Opera Mobile Accelerator is an optional service that further improves the browsing experience on handsets, reduces strain on operators' stretched data networks, while also saving users money on their monthly bills."  Operators that want to offer subscribers fast and cheap Web browsing, while simultaneously reducing the impact of Web browsing on their data network, can license the Mobile Accelerator directly from Opera   Another interesting part of their business model is, they are selling it directly to consumers on a subscription fees model. The other players in this market sell platform directly to carriers.       * 3 months subscription. Price: EUR 12     * 6 months subscription. Price: EUR 20     * 12 months subscription.
