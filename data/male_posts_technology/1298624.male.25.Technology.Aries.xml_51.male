It ranks up there with Cowboy Bebop and Macross as far as series go. Usually you will see a grouping of colors that the animators will use when producing their masterpieces, but in Escaflowne...you see every possible color in existence. It's never one color scheme that prevalent within the whole series, but a myriad of colors that keeps you interested (the story is excellent as well). The only thing that gets me is the "wide-eyed" look of the characters. Of course, this is characteristic of most anime characters, I think it was a bit over done for Escaflowne. Other than that, the series is excellent and ties in to one of the most interesting mysteries in the known world, the lost city of Atlantis.  You would expect an IBM T40 would be pretty easy to make, considering IBM is a huge corporation with manufacturing facilities of their own. I don't blame IBM for taking such a long time do produce my specific configuration. I know they have a huge back order to fill what with CEOs and executives alike purchasing these quality laptops for their own use. So it doesn't bother me so much to say that I can wait for a quality laptop to be built for my use. I'm just a consumer and customer, not a CEO or high profile executive. I can wait...or can I? Everyday that has past by, I've been wondering when I would get it. The ETA for everybody who has ordered this specially configured laptop is 8/14/03. At least, that's when my supplier will receive the stock from IBM, there is still a matter of shipping the item to me which could take another week or so. I hate backordered items. I hate waiting. Do I have patience? I'd like to think so, but only for certain people, things, events. An IBM Thinkpad T40 is something I do not have patience to wait for!  So I pass this really hard part in Star Wars: KOTOR. Pretty much had to sneak up on a ton of enemies and plant mines. I thought it was a pretty nasty setup when we started fighting. Everybody blew up in front of me when they ran over the mines. I'm thinking I have to do that for the infiltration mission I'm currently doing. Sneak in, plant mines, throw a grenade to mix it up and watch the fun. I'm not a jedi yet though...the only character in my game that has a lightsaber (and a dark force affiliated lightsaber at that) is Bastila. There has to be another way to infiltrate that whole Sith base without causing so much of a ruckus.  Warcraft III. There is one scenario map that has thoroughly pissed me off. You can only die once before respawning, you can only save once (apparently), and there is no way to go back in once you are dead. It sucks when you had a character that pretty much kicked ass but lose her to some stupid tank part of the map where you lose ALL your HP and abilities that would eradicate the enemies in there. Oh well. We'll keep trying to beat that map.
