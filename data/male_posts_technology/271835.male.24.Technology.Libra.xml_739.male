Before the money ran out they did manage to build 7 miles of tunnel. This dwarfs our previous tunnel trips to the  urlLink Byker Cully  (approx 2/3 of a mile) and the Victoria tunnel which had less than a mile of the tunnel you could explore. In lieu of a link to the long awaited (delayed due to technical reasons - again!) Victoria tunnel report you will have to make do with the background info  urlLink here .   via  urlLink boingboing
