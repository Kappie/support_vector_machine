So he's been literally BOUNCING off the walls. He can't be quite for two seconds and made the biggest scene in Meijers. He's back talked me and defied everything I've told him. I've lost track of all the punishments I've given out. From what I can remember, he's grounded thru Sunday. No bicycle, no cd player, no gameboy or xbox and no one will be coming over to play and he's not going anywhere. I called his doctor yesterday to ask her for a refill on his meds. I went and pickedit up today and rushed it up to the pharmacist who said, "Oh ready in 20 minutes". Thank GOD. Only 20 more minutes of this craziness .... I can do this. 20 minutes later, I rushed back up to the pharmacy to pick up the presciption only for them to say "We called the doctor to make sure we could give him the generic and they said sure HOWEVER the prescription is written for tomorrow and she wouldn't ok it for today". WHAT THE F***!?!?!?!?!?! Does she KNOW the day I've had?? Does she not UNDERSTAND what a parent goes through??? OMFG.  All of this on top of the stupid Dodge dealership was supposed to install our dvd player in our car this morning. I called them at 830 this morning to make sure we were still on to bring the car in. Well, no, apparently the guy didn't write the appointment down in the books. SO, no one knew what was going on. They were also supposed to give us an extra key and a driver's manual. The guy said he was going to have to order the dvd player to match our interior and no one could tell me anything about it. So, Dave (the guy I spoke to on the phone), said he'd call me riiiight back and let me know what was going on (remember this is 830) Two hours later and 3 phone calls back to them, he told me to call back at 2 and speak to Jamie (great another Jamie problem to deal with). I told Dave that I was not happy and that we've never had anything go smooth with any of the Thomas Dealerships (Kia or Dodge) and that it was always a huge hassle. I told him that he'd better be glad I called up there before I came, because had I come up there and had to sit with 3 kids, they would have had a VERY unhappy female on their hands---poor guy had no idea what to say... Anyway, yeah, so 2 o'clock rolls on and I call the dealership. I had about a 5 minute run around with the girl who answers saying that Jamie would just end up transferring me back to her anyway, so I mine as well talk to her. I told her he'd best not do that and I'd like to speak to him NOW, please. So she finally got him on the phone and he said, "Oh yeah, you were supposed to come in" I told him what went on that morning and he said, "Well we dont do that work here, we send it down the street". I asked him why he didn't tell me that and why did he say that they'd have to order it? He never gave me a direct answer but played it off like it was me who was the idiot for not going in. *deep breathes* SOOOoooo, we will be trying this again on Thursday.  Ok, I must go now and pick up my husband from the train station so he can enjoy this terrible mood that I am in. God, I feel sorry for him, bless his heart:(
