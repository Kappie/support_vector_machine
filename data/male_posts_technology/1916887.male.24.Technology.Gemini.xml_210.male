Taking center stage in our final report are Google, a video history of bulletin board systems, a healthy dose of 'lessons not learned' by our federal bureaucracy, anarchy, and the threat of physical violence." - This is a great article by someone who was actually in attendance of both events.  Unfortunately, I was unable to attend Defcon due to family situation (kid) and financial restraints.  There's always next year!
