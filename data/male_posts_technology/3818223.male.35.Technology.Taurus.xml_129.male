The narrative is interspersed with a lot of technical explanations, although not long enough to slow the tension of the story. Techno-geeks will probably find a way to pick the story apart (you know who you are - fingers stained orange by Cheetohs, chugging a Mountain Dew, and arguing online for the fourth straight hour why Captain Kirk's safe combination couldn't be 3 - 17 - 39), but for the rest of us, the science seems believable. Crichton did his usual mountain of research, and he is on familiar grounds. - 4 out of 5 stars.
