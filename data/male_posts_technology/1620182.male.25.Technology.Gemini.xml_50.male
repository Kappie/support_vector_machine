Yeah, it comes in handy when you need to wake up, shower, shave, dress, and get to work all in 15 minutes.  Yes, it's nice to be rid of the rush hour traffic.  Andy I like that there are only two stop signs and a stop light between here and there.  But there are down sides to it all.  For one, I'm now capable of arriving at work with my hair still wet from my shower.  Plus, if I pull one of those 15 minutes from bed to desk maneuvers I'm going to be grumpy as sin.  You would be too if you had to deal with your coworkers slightly past dreaming of some far away place or the girl you've always wanted.  Think about it.
