And why do the 76ers need Williamson? They've got  urlLink Glenn Robinson  (listed as SF), they've got  urlLink Kedrick Brown ,  urlLink Kyle Korver , and they just drafted  urlLink Andre Iguodala . I'm looking at their roster and I can't really figure it out.   Fantasy  Impact   (Corliss)   urlLink Corliss  will probably be getting about the same playing time in Philadelphia as he did with the Pistons. He should be playing behind Glenn Robinson at the SF spot.  He'll probably be good for 8-12 points and 3-4 rebounds. His 50% field-goal shooting is attractive.  In fact, "We like that he has a high field-goal percentage," Sixers general manager Billy King said at yesterday's press conference in the Lexus room of the Wachovia Center. He did go on to support my doubts by saying "Nothing is going to be easy in training camp this season. Guys are going to be fighting and competing for starting spots, which is a good thing. With a young player like Andre [Iguodala] and other athletic guys like Brian [Skinner], Samuel [Dalembert] and Kedrick [Brown], I think we have a great mix of talent." I think by "athletic guys" he meant "small forwards." And by "fighting for starting spots" he meant "we have too many of them."   Fantasy   Impact  (Coleman)   urlLink Samuel Dalembert  is going to see a lot of time at center now that Coleman is gone. He had 8, 8, and 2 blocks a game last year. He's a sleeping giant about to awaken.  Count it.   As for Coleman, he'll be backing up the Wallaces in Detroit, along with Elden Campell and Antionio McDyess. I can't see him getting much more time than he had in Philadelphia, and as unimpressive as his numbers were there, I can't recommend him as anything more than a 6 and 6 if you're lucky. Combine that with his FG and Ft percentages and it's not looking good.
