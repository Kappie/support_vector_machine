Customer: "I watched this movie the other day..." Me: "...ok." Customer: "It was called 'Naughty Night Nurses'. There was this extremely beautiful woman who..." (Rest of the customer's comments omitted in order to keep this site family-friendly :P ) Me: "..." Me: "..." Me: "...so what's the percentage on that disk check?"  This one was doubly bizarre. First, he spins off insanely abruptly from the current topic. Second, the fact that he felt it was a good idea to discuss his favorite porn movies with me in the first place. This customer gets a good old fashioned "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot???".  This next one wasn't quite as bad:  Customer(female): "Has anyone ever told you, you have a really sexy voice?" Me: "Not really, but thanks." Customer: "Have you ever considered..." (whisper): "...phone sex?" Me: "Uh...no. As flattering as that is, we won't be going there."  I try to imagine what would possess a person to say things like this to a total stranger, but I can't wrap my brain around it.  We won't get into the crazy e-mail addresses people provide me as part of their contact information (One example: a KKK address. Seriously).  What ever happened to shame and embarrassment? Are these just examples of exhibitionism? Cries for attention?  My guess, just the general insanity that seems to be overly abundant among tech support customers.
