It took her a second or two to realize that she was sitting at a light that had turned green and there were no vehicles in front of her.  She awkwardly moved her foot quickly from the brake to the gas, causing her vehicle to lurch through the intersection.  God, her head hurt so much.  It took all she had just to get out of the house this morning, practically putting on her blouse as she walked out of the door.  Thank God that Brad had to leave the house for work before she had to get up, she hated how he looked at her after a long night in the bar.  She certainly hoped she wasn’t late again, hasn’t she’d been late a couple of times this week already?  At the next light she glanced in the mirror and didn’t like what she saw.  When did she get so old?  She promised herself last night that she was going to have just a couple of drinks and hang with Jessica, a familiar sight at the local watering hole.  And then, one thing led to another, and after running up a $70 bar tab it was last call.  She did deserve her time to relax because, God knows, the last five years of her life have been a struggle, with every time she turned around there was another crisis to deal with.  Brad just couldn’t seem to hold a job – something always seemed to happen and it was never his fault, or so he said, so there were many periods the past few years she had to work in her family’s deli at night just to make ends meet.  Her mother’s long illness and welcome death was an emotionally draining experience, and then after months of feeling exhausted finally going to the doctor’s and finding out that she had lupus.  How much was a person supposed to deal with?  It used to only be the Friday afternoon happy hours, it was such a treat to go out with her work friends for a couple of drinks after the long work week, not having to go home to the tension and pressure of Brad and his difficulties, not having to see their home, once the basis for all their dreams but now looking worn and tatty from benign neglect.  Everything at home was so hard, but everything out was so easy.  Everyone was everyone’s best friend, and she found she felt relaxed and comfortable with herself for the first time in years.  For the first time in what seemed like forever, she was enjoying herself.  But the happy hours turned to “happy” nights, and then to “happy” weekends, and now she was going out during the week.  She tried to go home, but after dinner she always began to feel restless and frustrated, and looked for excuses to leave the house.  Brad never said anything when she said she was “popping out to the store” as he sat in his chair glued to the television watching some crap on the WB.  She felt so relieved walking out the front door.  She loved the smell of the bar, the bright neon advertisements drawing her in, and the always friendly bartenders a welcome sight from the drudgery of home.  How could she stay home when this was out there?  She quickly applied some makeup at the next light trying to make herself look presentable.  It was hard with her head feeling so fuzzy.  Tonight, she would stay home, or if she went out, she would only have a couple.  She was so tired of dealing with this in the morning.
