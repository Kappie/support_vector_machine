I thought I had found something yesterday, but ran out of time trying to configure it and couldn't find the link again.  What a maroon.  I'll continue looking.  This isn't a perfect solution, because it only tells you that the site is updated, and not exactly where, but it beats randomly checking with regularity and frantically searching the site for any updates.  With any luck, the notification will include the name of the post, and whether the change is a new post, or a comment to an existing post.  I'll let you know if I find anything, and make it available.
