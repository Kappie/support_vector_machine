On Wednesday when I was working from home, the entries just came out by themselves I didn't even need to put much thought into it. But yesterday after I came back from work, I was really struggling to type words out, I had something I wanted to blog about but it in the end it got so frustrating I just gave up. Maybe I should just stick to blogging on my off days.
