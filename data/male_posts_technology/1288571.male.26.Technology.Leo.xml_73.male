It's been well over a month since I cancelled and switched to Bell Sympatico High-Speed (DSL). At any rate, yay, I can update my blog. haha  I've long since got a new computer case - the Antec Sonata. It's extremely quiet. So quiet, in fact, that I can't hear it sitting right next to it. Awesome eh?  Almost Christmas too! Yay. 1 more week of work next week then 2 weeks off for vacation!  Anyways, head on over to the  urlLink forum  and have some fun.
