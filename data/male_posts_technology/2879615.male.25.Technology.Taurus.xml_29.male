For now, holla at this man, who is actually a field biologist studying the female vaginal area of indigineous guatemalan females. It so happens that I know him personally, but declined his request for me to continue his work exlaining that i need to focus on my studies.     im watchin licky smokin white smoke off a spoon with a straw. and now hes layin back relazin and enjoying it. the crack is bubblin on the spoon and we are having a good time. no crack for me today, at least until it gets passed to me.  sincerly, keyser soze. crackheads call me glue.
