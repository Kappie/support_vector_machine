No man would resist having their second look at a charming lady. Perhaps, some would approach and attempt to befriend her. Some would probably rape her mentally. Some, would be like me, smile and walk away.   Why walk away?  Some things, are better to leave it where it started, that is beauty.   When i look at an ancient vase, i could be reading a tall tale of how it was created, survived centuries of environment rampage, but not yield a single damage. My perception of the vase, "no matter how great it seems to be, it is only a vase."  Zen mediation took place in my mind. I have begin to investigate reality to where it comes from. If you are to ask a physicist what is reality, he probably tell you its electromagnetic waves, gravity and 2 others.   In other words, the things we see, the wine we drink, the food we ate, the woman we loved, are just that 4 elements. We have all been fooled, by our senses. We have been confined in our mind, in the world we first created in order to shelter ourselves.   If i close my eyes, i see nothing.. because there is no light reflecting the beings, causing images and objectifications to take place in my brain that is recepting the information.   Wisdom.. is to see through the point of suffering and end it. Compassion, is to help others to obtain wisdom.  Just like the Matrix.. the two colored pills.  I would also take the stance of NEO.  DJ Evolution has begun. Are you excited?
