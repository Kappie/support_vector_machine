It would be easier to choose an album, like Blondie's Parallel Lines, maybe.  That sounds more pop than, say, Costello's This Year's Model.  But to be honest, the stuff from that time period is really before my time -- I experienced more through childhood osmosis than conscious choice.  If I had to choose something from my own nascent maturity, it would be something from 79-82, after New Wave changed slightly.  From there, I'd choose Gary Numan's "Cars" or perhaps Berlin's "The Metro."  Both of those lean more towards synth pop than Parallel Lines, but it's when I started to become aware of pop music, so it's a sound that has a stronger emotional appeal.
