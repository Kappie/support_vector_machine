The General Accounting Office report, presented at a congressional hearing into the scandal-plagued program, determined that 80 percent of U.N. records had not been turned over.   The world body claims it transferred all information it had - including 3,059 contracts worth about $6.2 billion for delivery of food and other civilian goods to the post-Saddam governing body, the Coalition Provisional Authority.   But the GAO report also found that a database the U.N. transferred to the authority was "unreliable because it contained mathematical and currency errors in calculation of contract costs," the report found.   The GAO findings, which were aired at a hearing of the House International Relations Committee, raise new questions about corruption and mismanagement in the biggest-ever U.N. aid program - and what has been called the biggest financial scandal in history. An earlier GAO report said Saddam ripped off over $10 billion.   Committee Chairman Henry Hyde said the report raised serious concerns - and could have "a potential impact on the reputation and credibility of the United Nations."     Well. It's about time this story saw some exposure in some major media. So far the UN's evident ineptitude and corruption has thus far fallen on deaf ears. How this can be a non-issue to so many around the world just blows my mind. Conspiracy theorists and leftists who would jump at any chance to sling mud at the vaporous Bush-Cheny-Halliburton 'scam' (so far proving to be nothing but baseless rumourmongering), choose to instead hum and ha about the Oil-for-food fiasco. Not only was there sufficient documented evidence, now that evidence has 'dissappeared'? Good grief.  Where's the so-called objectivity, huh?
