To my understanding whoever puts up his views about God and spirituality puts God on one side and alms on the other side of a balance scale. Investing for God is poles apart from providing alms. A devotee who spends crores in God can also be helping poor and the vice versa. Why is that we always advocate that “instead of spending Rs.5 for God I would spend Rs.2 for a poor or the disabled”. Why not do both? Why is that we have either of two and not both of two?   Hence I hope the point to be mulled over is whether decorating God with costly ornaments is necessary or not? To your surprise I would reply “yes that seems necessary”. To elucidate, normally God’s and Goddess are perceived as another ‘human’ super power and not as super power alone(why is that people don’t call Murugan as Mr.Murugan or add ‘inga’ at the tail) it is clear that   They observe Gods as living being  They assume themselves to be acquaintance for God.  Hope u would abide…  So what?   It is as simple as buying a necklace to your mom or a bangle to your wife. People want to give the best for the best and they are happy doing it. Why do we quarrel? .  To conclude ‘people are not offering ornaments thinking that they are doing good thing, it is not understood as an alternative to alms’. There is selfishness alone. It is like sharing your profit with your partner. He is offering a minor share to God because he thinks it is God who gave him that and not because he wanted to do something good.   To add few more points(forgive those who have faith). I would rather compare believers of God as Piggy backers. Yes people have two reasons to pray God   1.Thanks to good things  2. Rescue from bad things.    To my belief he himself is the cause for both. People say I get peace when I pray God. Of course when you shed your responsibility to some other person, you get peace of mind. So when I believe that it is because of me and I am the one to face it and set it right, so when I believe , my success is due to me; then why should I thank God who has done nothing.   I have the courage to confront issues. I am responsible for what has occurred to me. Only people who don’t accept this will accept God and that is what I call it as piggy backing. Ranjini advocated that spirituality has awarded this society with good things. Please tell me one at the least.. The sense of God has made man irresponsible. The first thing we do when something goes wrong is to find a person to blame or to find a reason to say ‘I am not the cause’.   Except mother nature I wouldn’t accept anything can be a cause other than us. Don’t argue now with a valid point ’aren’t you piggy backing on nature’ certainly no. I am talking about floods, sunlight..etc Please do not also argue that nature is created by God..etc   I am interested in asking you why do we need GOD? Rather than asking you is there a God?
