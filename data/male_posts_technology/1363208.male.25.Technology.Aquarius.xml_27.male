Unlucky me tho, got some reading error near the end of the movie. I bought two other stories, in VCD form. One is just okay, despite poor picture quality, I still can watch the movie. A new movie. A pirated VCD. What to expect? Of course poor quality pictures. The other VCD was supposedly a Thai movie but it doesn't seem to work. Dammit!  A housemate's a little bit confused, I guess. It looks like I ain't myself buying movies. Just not like me. Not like the usual me. I don't complain. It's just once in a blue moon. So, sometimes we have to walk out of the shell too, right?
