The reason for this has been the cricket World Cup that was going on for over a month. I've been busy watching, eating, drinking, sleeping and  urlLink blogging  cricket.  In addition to  urlLink blogging  about the World Cup, I was also running a  urlLink contest  on my  urlLink world cup site . With my friend Abhijeet giving invaluable help all along, both of us managed to keep the blog and the contest running up-to-date throughout the duration of the World Cup. 33 teams took part in the contest. Now that the world cup is over... here are the  urlLink final standings . Congratulations to  Dipali  for winning the contest!! She managed to pip Faizan at the post by the slimmest of margins. And as Abhijeet  urlLink explains , it was just a matter of one ball in the final match and it would've been Faizan who won the contest.  Well anyways, I think I'll be much more regular with my blogging on thi blog from now on. And I have lot to blog about. The war is a constant source of material which prompts a reaction, one way or the other.  Stick around folks... we're just getting started!! :-)
