He is quite an interesting character and since I saw that old photo again I have been thinking of things he used to say and do. I f you have seen this man let me know. I think Deano hasn't seen him for like a year or something so I am intrigued as to where he is and what he is up to.   "Remember in 1982 when they solved the mystery of the Loch Ness monster?"
