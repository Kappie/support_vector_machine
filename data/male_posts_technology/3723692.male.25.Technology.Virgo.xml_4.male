Its basically a sachet of lemon juice and it tastes simply great, very much like fresh lime water. So here you go get ready for the ride of making a great limopani slush.  Note: This will make 2 to 3 glasses.   5 cups ice cube , crush it so that you save the blades of the mixture and yourself from wraith of your mom.  1.5 cup water.   3 sachet of limopani .  6 tea spoons sugar  or as you desire.  Place everything in the blender/mixture. Blend until smooth. Pour into glasses and have time of your life ;).  Have fun and do try Adios
