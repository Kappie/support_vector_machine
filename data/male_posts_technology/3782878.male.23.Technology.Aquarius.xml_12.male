I met another ally in the Call of Honour, a High Elf Wizard, another useful tool, I find wizards are quite handy when taking on larger hunts. But today I found my true power, I have mastered what the elder Necromancers refer to as fear-kiting  The art is intense as a lot of things have to go correctly, and the only reason I had failed it before was my inexperience with casting my spells, my spells kept fizzling out and soon I'd be out of mana, and out of life. The technique involved casting darkness upon my prey, and then as it's coming for me I send my skeletal minion to attack, while my minion is heading towards it I immediately cast my fear spell on it to send it running away, after my fear lands I poison the monster and then suck it's life into my own if I am weak. The slowed monster can't possibly escape my minion, and the poison whittles the monster down into nothingness while my minion kills it. I have also found that if I commit to the dark pact, and let me life force be drained for benefit of my mana, that I can perform this kiting much longer than I could without it.  I used this method while the others were too low on mana to do anything constructive, and when they were ready, the wizard would hit the quarry with his powerful fire spell, and my pet would keep the prey away from us. I could then poison it while the shaman slowed it.   Before we left for the evening the Wizard wanted to test his Area of Effect spells. so I pulled 2 giant scorpions upon us, both of them higher in strength than I, and the wizard then held them in place, and hit them both with fire, while I hit both with my darkness and poison. my pet dispatched one easily, and the other went down almost as fast.  I have learned my power and that I do not depend on anyone to survive, however, the more useful allies I have on my side, the larger enemies will be that much easier to feast upon.  Love is a weakness, it must be shown behind closed doors, Qaz
