I have the same driving instructur as Tom and Paul, the lovly Alison. I had 2 hrs or 2X 50 mins, i did loads, i can already do gears 1, 2 and 3, all the stearing business, i drove round cones, i stopped, did skid control, (as part of the stopping procedure) Also something exciting happened!!! the hook from a glider came falling to the ground towards our car! On Alisons say so, we quickly moved away from the landing site!!!! could have been a problem. anyway, it was great and i am happy, on monday we go drive in sandersted!!! at 11, so i advise you tell your parents to keep off the road between 11 and 12 on monday.  Apart from driving it is my birthday, or will be in 2 hrs and 20 mins, i got my pressies this evening, some cloths and driving stuff, main present being the driving lessons. I also got some money from distant relatives etc etc etc. Urm, tommrow i am going out for a meal with wayne, and both our girlfriends, so that will be nice.    SUNDAY BOWLING AMF 2 O'CLOCK  All of you lot are invited, and all your partners, (or potential partners, or whoever!) its kinda for my birthday but i am leaving it fairly open and everyone pays for themselves. Tell other people and stuff. Right i think i better go do some work and stuff. See you all soon, Hope you all well, Good luck with all the exams and stuff, Dave
