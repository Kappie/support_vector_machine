Sleep is a limiting resource, but I rarely treat it as such.   Loren is a good guy, who has many doubts, but a few blinding moments of clarity. It's really worth any amount of trouble to be near people who can see through the intervening layers to the artistry of others, and the situations we find ourselves in.   Seeing what is, and what was meant to be accurately is a very great resource, Loren, you should learn to value it, and yourself more highly.
