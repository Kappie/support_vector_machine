But you can't just go prancing around town with your collar up every day, you have to do it correctly.Here are some easy to follow guidlines for popping your collar.  1). Pop the collar only on a two or three button polo...button down shirts just don't work, as much as you might want them to. Other pieces of attire can be substituted from time to time, such as the fleece, but can only be ruled on ina case by case basis, so pop at your own discretion, or those of a brother with better fashion sense than you. Multiple polos worn in layers must have both collars popped at all times.  2). Popping the collar causes you to look cool, but do NOTact as if you think you are cool- you will be trying too hard.Act as if you frat on a daily basis.   3). Do not pop the collar at any event in which you don't know at least 5-10 people.You run the risk of being ostracized, and must have multiple other fratties to back you up, in style or physically.  4). When popping the collar, do not button the top button. Thisproduces the look of a dog halo, and is very unapealing.  5). When popping the collar, you must walk around with a completely lost look on your face, as if you are really hammered, even when you're not. This is frat.
