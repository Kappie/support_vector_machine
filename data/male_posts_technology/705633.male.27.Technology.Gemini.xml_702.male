The film stars  urlLink Jim Carrey  and  urlLink Kate Winslet  as a couple who individually both end up visiting Laguna Inc, a company that specialises in memory erasure to wipe each other from their mind (something I'm sure we've all wished possible at least once).  The plot unravels in it's own special Kaufman/Tarantino style while managing to keep a blanket of romance wrapped around our two main stars.  Supporting cast includes  urlLink Kirsten Dunst  looking damned tasty in a little shirt and knickers and a whining  urlLink Elija 'Frodo' Wood  as part of Laguna's tech crew.  Overall I really enjoyed this film, the acting and cinematography were superb and the story was well told with a strong visual style... be aware that it is at times a little confusing however pay attention and you'll be suitably rewarded by the end.  It certainly isn't for everyone, a lacklustre 7 people made it in to the start of our screening and four of those got up and left before it finished leaving just the two of us and an odd looking guy to stare at the credit wondering how much we missed first time round.  Highly recommended,  [)
