I have failed at getting either  urlLink Samba  or  urlLink netatalk  to work on the unix box.  Both will compile, but both have serious problems when launched.  There was even difficulty sharing between the Windows ME and Windows 2000 boxes!  I forgot that I disabled Guest access on the W2K machine, and that prevented the WinME machine from connecting.  Grr
