Today's showcase is explaining the co-worker RV. RV is one of the guys I work with. He is from Equador! (I swear that the people of our help desk are selected at random) He likes to talk on the phone in Spanish. In fact, I am pretty sure he likes it better than talking in English. He makes a pot of coffee every morning by freshly grinding the beans with care in his small bean grinder. Then he shovels it in the coffee pot and tries to strain some water through, even though the coffee is so strong it would knock you out if you weren't used to it. After he gets done with that I steal a cup and mix in some coffee with my cream and sugar. I think if I took more than one cup of coffee, then my heart would explode from the caffeine intake.  He likes to ask other people their opinion on the problems that he has to solve. I am not sure if he is just someone who doesn't know or if he is needing a second opinion. He has done some forgetful things in the past so I don't know. He is in his upper 40s and still likes to look at the boobs at work. I like to look at boobs at work too but I have been avoiding it to keep from getting into trouble. All the guys here in my office love "the boobies" (and "the booty"), and I say "the boobies" instead of just boobs because I would like to stress the importance of finding the good kind of boobies that would justify a title (damn like... those are the boobies to end all boobies... or maybe that is just something I find funny). The quest is just as important as the goal in this case. There have been manly mags passed around showcasing a variety of Godly ass shots as well.  I seem to be getting off track (it's that boob talk I guess). RV also likes to use the term "little boys room". Now I am not hating on this term or anything, I just think it is kind of funny to hear a 40 something guy say it. I guess this is what having kids does to a person. Finally, he is a shorter Equadorian  urlLink Bob Vila ! He loves to do work on his "new" old house. He is remodeling the whole place (it seems like) from top to bottom. He has certification to wire his shiznit and work on home improvement. Right now he is doing the downstairs bathroom. It was funny looking the way it was before. Every week he brings in his new pictures on the progress of his house (the crown molding, the new closet, the tiling on the floor, the new kitchen cabinets, etc...). We make jokes about bringing him around to our own places and having him fix up some stuff. All in all RV is a nice guy. So what if jokes are made about him eating tacos and watching out for immigration officials? It's ok because he's cool and they are just jokes. And he tells some about watermelon and fried chicken too (although that is directed at CB in particular, our resident black pi-mp hehehe) it is all in the name of good fun.
