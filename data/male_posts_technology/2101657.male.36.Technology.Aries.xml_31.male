You have to add 2.5oz of 2cycle oil to 1gal of gas for this little monster.  Well, I went out, started up the car, cleared off the snow, went down to my local Big A   and paid $10 for a 2.5gal gas can, and 1 quart of oil.    I made it easy on myself and just put in 5oz of oil into the gas can while I was still in the store. Made sense, I was nice and warm and it easy with it on the counter.  I figured that would work out great anyway, as when I then went to the gas station and put in 2gal of gas, it mixed it up nicely for me.  Get home, fill that bad boy up, take it out front, and then, pull my brains out to get it to start. It didnt like being cold either.     Finally got it going, and then proceeded to do the snow around our old blue beater mobile. Took care of that really fast, and I was beginning to think I might like this.  So I went past our neighbors drive way, to where I had parked our nice car yesterday, and started to clean that out.  When I left, so did our neighbor upstairs, and I beat her back, so I put our car in the clean spot in front of the house.  Z*lda and the boys were leaving shortly for a swimming party anyway.  So I proceeded to just do a 30ft stretch behind a burried in car.  I even helped by clearning the street almost up to her bumper.  It was VERY hot work though. I even did some of the street, connecting to the neighbors driveway, as I figure if it was clean, it would make it easier for us to park in front of our house.   I then went and did the side walk where I got snow on it from the street. Then for the heck of it, I even did the little sidewalk that goes between the two houses to the south of us.  I figure, it's helping out w/o being asked, and lots of neighbor kids cut through on that sidewalk on their way home from school.     Just like the BoyScout motto says "Do a good turn daily".
