       
      I just got home today and my beta fish, called "Dragon" died. Kelly's fish, called "Flower" died just a few days ago. Now there are no fish in our family anymore. You might say, "Oh it's only a fish," but it wasn't. I had another fish about a year ago, named "Ralf," but it was a plain-old white goldfish who lived only two weeks. I bought "Flower" and "Dragon" at the end of September or in October. These are the longest-living fish I have ever had. From October-January for a little tiny fish is a long time. Well, they are gone now, forever.
