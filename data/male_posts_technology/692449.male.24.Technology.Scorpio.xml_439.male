In particular, the State Department has disregarded "the recommendation of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom -- an independent body created by the IRFA  -- to list Saudi Arabia as a country of 'particular concern for religious freedom .'…The State Department also turned a blind eye to its own findings on Pakistan, Eritrea and Turkmenistan and failed to list them as countries of 'particular concern.'" Legum concludes: "For all the White House's talk about religious freedom and its open appeal to religious constituencies in the election campaign, Bush's record in this area is stunning for its lack of interest, consistency and results."           THE ARMY'S 300-PAGE WHITEWASH:  The most disgraceful attempt to date to deflect blame was a 300-page "investigation" released in July by the Army's inspector general. Astoundingly, the report found no "systemic" problems with the treatment of detainees by the military. The inspector general reached that conclusion "even though there were  94 documented cases of prisoner abuse ...even though only four prisons of the 16 they visited had copies of the Geneva Conventions...even though the military police were improperly involved in interrogations; even though young people plucked from civilian life were sent to guard prisoners...with no training." The so-called investigation "did not dig into the abuse cases, but merely listed them." The report also "made no attempt to find out who had authorized threatening prisoners with dogs and sexually humiliating hooded men." The inspector general was satisfied with merely reviewing the official Army field manual and noting those techniques in the manual.         WITHHOLDING RED CROSS REPORTS FROM SENATE INVESTIGATORS:  For months, the Pentagon  refused to share Red Cross reports  documenting the conditions in American military prisons. In July, they finally agreed to show the reports "briefly to senators and a few members of the Armed Services Committee staff after the senators' personal aides were ushered out." The reports were then brought back to the Pentagon.
