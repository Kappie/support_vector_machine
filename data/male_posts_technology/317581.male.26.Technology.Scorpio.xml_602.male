The goal of a contractor is to become a real employee (goal #1). Everything we do is a hope to someday attain the reliable check of a full time employee. At least that is the way it is for at least 95% of us.  Every 9 - 12 months I am forced to take a 100-day non-paid leave. This can put the hurt on, as most of the time this happens from November - February. One goal many of us have is to be able to contract again after this 100-day break (goal #2). If no employer is willing to rehire you, then you will have a pain in the ass trying to get back in.  Key points to maintain while you ARE a contractor. 1) ALWAYS be available for overtime - this is key, especially when you have low finances, missing 1 OT session could mean your slot is no longer available for a few weeks. (also, OT is considered a perk that may not last much longer, if you are given the opportunity you should seize it, as full-time employees don't get time and a half)  2) Don't hound about become a full time employee - first impress your boss by ALWAYS being available for OT, then be ready to answer off hand remarks about future job positions  3) Know how to be a hard worker (This is key because you're trying to shine above the rest of your cohorts, some of which the full times have pet names for, i.e. Crazy legs)  4) Know how to get shit done (When your boss comes and asks you to do something, the first time you may ask questions, after that you should KNOW how to do it. If given a task by your boss, you should complete your tasks and have a short 1 - 2 sentence response with your results. Having written results in an email can also be a great way for your boss to know the info, without you having to interrupt his work day)  5) If your boss enters the room, be the first person to ask if they need any help. They will begin to look to you as a person that can get shit done. This will help in both goal #1 and goal #2.   That's really about all you can do while you're a contractor. If you impress your boss enough, he may decide you are a valuable asset which should be hired full-time, but it takes a LOT of work to get to this point.   Hang in there and you may make it. But usually people will either not be hired back (black listed) or get "real" jobs elsewhere.  That's about all I have to say about that. It's interesting to think about the parallels that appear in my life to this particular segment. Peace- Tim
