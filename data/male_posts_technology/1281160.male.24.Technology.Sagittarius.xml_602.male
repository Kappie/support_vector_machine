What we lacked (I Certainly see  feel in my job career) is v r not aware of the exact things going on in the business world while v r doing our studies..... V had a wonderfull opportunity for spending 1 month of First year vacation in a company.... But most of us didnt used it properly.... But I am not frustrated with my current job (my first job) coz we should accept whatever we get and tune overself towards what we can provide in this job; side by side sharpenning our saw (i.e, core competancy, or ur life aim whatever you put) than to get sulk over the issues arrising out of the current job....  What I have mentioned above is for tuning yourself for a long term career..... I go with Vijay's suggestion for an immediate get thru for a job after studies....  To succeed in life.... The same thing "THINK WIN - u r sure to win" Thinking any one can do...  But u should feel u r winning.... crossing a pebble over the expeditition towards Everest is also a situation where u have won....  Believe u can do with full cofidence not even a nanocm less that that... then u have achieved.  yeah, rest personally....  Cheers Ram
