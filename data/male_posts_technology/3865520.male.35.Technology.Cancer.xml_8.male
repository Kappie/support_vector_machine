I figure a BLOG is a good way to keep track of tidbits I learn as I venture into the new worlds of project management and data warehousing.  Here's how the new gig lined up for me:  For the past two years, I was a tech lead on an Oracle 11i project. If you're not familiar, Oracle 11i is the latest version of the eBusiness suite from Oracle (the data base company). My team's role was to collect all of the various configurations that we needed and to manage the loading of those configurations (and track changes...maintain several instances of the data for development, testing, production, etc). So that was a huge project ($80M+ )and the project was a big success. My team was a cross-functional one so I really got to see all the different parts of the business.  So as that project wrapped...at least the critical phases wrapped...I started looking for something new. I think my management team wanted to keep me engaged at some level, and they knew I had an interest in business processes. So I've taken on a new role as an IT Project Manager and have been assigned a project that really has yet to be defined (I'll be working with the business to understand what their initiatives are and what data they will need). The project team I am part of is called Issue-to-Resolution Strategic Information Systems or I2R SIS. Issue-to-Resolution is the business process that handles post-sales support for Cisco equipment (this of it as traditional tech support with a lot of bells and whistles).  Anyway, the new gig has me reading lots of books on data warehousing ("The Data Warehouse Toolkit"- Kimball, Ross and "Mastering Data Warehouse Design: Relational and Dimensional Techniques"- Imhoff, Geiger, Galemmo and "Oracle DBA Guide to Data Warehousing and Star Schemas"-Scalzo). I'm also boning up on the associated technologies (Oracle Warehouse Builder, Oracle Designer, Business Objects). Then there are also the "project management" skills (ok, so I've been leading projects and doing project management for years, but now that my title has changed it was requested that I formalize my training)- I'm enrolled in several course offered by ESI and will probably work towards an associate level certification...just to have the lambskin (LOL).  So this is my work life right now. Not terribly attractive, but it pays the bills. I'm hoping to leverage my PM position and the touchpoints I'll have with the business into the next gig: maybe a role within the business. I have a goal of getting into the management area, but without an MBA that might be tricky at Cisco these days. Promotions nearly impossible to come by and pretty much every manager or senior project manager I know was groomed outside of Cisco, then hired into the senior PM or Manager roles. So it seems to me that corporate America isn't all that different from my Army days: you have to move on to move up!
