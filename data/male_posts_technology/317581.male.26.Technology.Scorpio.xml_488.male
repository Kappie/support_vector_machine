I don't know why I became so needy at the end and I would like to think that I've grown.   It seems right now that I will always love you, but I'm sure that is changing right now, even as I write this.   I am not looking to get back into a relationship right now, but I am looking for some new people to hang out with.   I hope that we can remain friends after this, but I know right now that I don't want to be without you, so that is what I must do.  Peace, Tim
