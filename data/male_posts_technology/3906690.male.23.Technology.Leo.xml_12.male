No, my former boss from two years ago or so asked if I could work for him again because he was short handed. He owns JR Construction, which contracts with oil and natural gas giants such as Chevron Texaco Inc., ExxonMobil, Elk Horn Operating Company, US Oil  Gas, Harken Southwest Corp. (also known as Rim Southwest), Giant Industries Inc., and Tricore. There are also other smaller companies, privately owned. It’s hard to believe all these companies fit into this tiny area. Well not so tiny, it's pretty much spread out, ExxonMobil and Chevron Texaco having the most leases, acreage-wise. US Oil  Gas also has a huge lease, but they’re located in the canyon area. Harken...hmm, they have smaller leases south of where I live, scattered. They also have leases down in Arizona. Elk Horn is based northwest of here, right along the mesa. Giant Industries is located in the town of Montezuma Creek. Not sure where Tricore is located. Private owned companies have leases way out in the middle of nowhere, places hard to get to. Places where not a lot of oil and gas are produced, 10-20 barrels a day, compared to 10,000 barrels or so produced daily by ExxonMobil, and Chevron Texaco.   When I started with JR Construction, I was a roustabout, an inexperienced laborer. I worked my way to an operator, then started my training as a field technician, also known as a "pumper." Somewhere between being an operator and my training as a field technician I also went through training at the Gas Plant. The Gas Plant is located in Aneth, UT...a property of ExxonMobil, not Aneth but the Gas Plant. That place is very wicked. It’s like a tiny city way out in the desert that looks like Gotham City. At night it's like something from a zombie flick *L*...as cool as that sounds, that place is very dangerous. If a glitch were to happen, *BOOM*...left with a huge crater. The Gas Plant is the Central station. This is where all oil, gas, and water go for the separation process. Out in the field there's smaller separators and whatnot at locations called Satellites, Batteries, Areas, and Sections, but the Gas Plant is where all the action takes place. After the entire separation process each fluid flow in their own destined flowline and out of the area into New Mexico. Oh I forgot to mention, during my time with JR Construction I mainly worked with ExxonMobil. I have gone out to work with these other companies mentioned, but ExxonMobil is the one I stuck with.   Anyhow, I'm not sure what I'll be doing when I get hired on again. I already talked with my former boss (soon to be boss again), and mentioned to him that I will be going back to school at the end of August, and he was like "oh yea, that’s cool, it's going to work out." So I will be working for a month and a half, I just need to check in. That was my plan for this morning, but yesterday evening I went to Durango to pick up my hard hat, Steel-toed boots, and my work clothes. I left Durango about midnight, and got back here at around 2:00 this morning. I didn't go to sleep until 3:00 or so. I set my alarm for 5:45, I woke up at 8:00, my aunt called then and I looked at the clock and I was like DAMN. Then I fell asleep again...phone again, :D it was Ana, she was on her break. I talked to her for a couple of minutes. Afterwards I sat around strumming my guitar. I need to re-string my guitar :P.   On a good note, I will be still doing self-contract work, only on weekends though. Mostly landscape work. It pays well, just because I set my own wage :P
