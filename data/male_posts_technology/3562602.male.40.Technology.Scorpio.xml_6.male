I "mostly" finished my AIX script at work today.  It's really silly but I think it's an accomplishment.  I had two Chicago dogs for lunch at Saucy Dog.  It's been awhile since I have a good dog.  I like working here so far.  Just keeping my cool and learning.  Went to meeting for daughters soccer team.  She made the "A" team.  It's going to be expensive but worth it.  She really enjoys it.    Didn't get home till almost 8 and had a late supper and went to bed.  I thought I could get to painting the kitchen cabinets but haven't had time.  The house is a mess and smells like cat.  I gotta do something.
