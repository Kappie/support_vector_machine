I had to run a script last night that took bloody forever, so I didn't get into bed till after 1 a.m. So I watched mostly the news, seeing what the Demo's had to say in 'why should I vote for Kerry'.   Now most that are getting to know me would say that I am already biased, but polls show  most of the U.S. have already made their decision anyway as well. So in my view what did the cheerleaders have to say? Actually I agree that Bill Clinton was the most articulate, clear speaker for the night. I also agree what they say in regards to 'agree or disagree with Clintons politics, he's a great speaker'. But, through all the chanting, cheerleading, ect. I never heard a 'why should I vote for Kerry.'  I know, this DNC was not to do a "Bush bashing" but a 'why should I vote for Kerry'. I thought Clinton did the best attempt in what makes Demo's and Repub's different in worldviews. ( interesting he actually used the term worldviews ). But I never heard what Kerry would do diferently or what he would do now too help/raise America back on  it's feet. But I have to make a notation that they are not using the name "Bush" for bashing but they are definitely slicing/dicing the 'current adminastration and republicans'.  Now yesterday during work here at PA Corporate, I had a small discussion with a couple of guys. During conversation another individual approached and basically asked me, 'do you think they (the democrats, ect) are voting agains Bush due to hatred or the fact he is doing such a terrible job.' I promptly looked him in the eye and said 'easily, hatred'. Of course he retorted that the Iraq war was all a lie, dah dah dah.  It wasn't hard to see he was a 'left wing liberal'. I am not going into the discussion but I will say, he left mumbling. One of the guys ( in the original conversation ) came to my cubicle and actually said 'that was great' and he had prior  discussions with the liberal guy and he just didn't know as much as I did on debating.  My point? It's all in the facts people, even though I never would be able to have that liberal left make a turn on his view or positiion, by my discussion with him, others listening in see's the facts and learn from it. Let's face it, there are many out with their minds already made up, but others can still be educated.   So what I say is, show me the facts. What has Kerry voted on during his term? I am pasting some interesting views of Kerry on the bottom of this post.  Today, I am on support and will be giving a little training class on VPS. ( Virtual Print Station ) Basically I probably will not get anything else done. I did manage to get some things done yesterday at work that made me feel like I accomplished some of my projects but we will see for today.  On the way to the hotel yesterday, stopping at TGIF's to grab for supper, I tried the taste of 'Samuel Adams' beer. The lady at the bar, let me try the taste. I wasn't impressed. The only beer I have ever tried and continue to like is Corona.  Tonight, Michael Moore will be on Bill O'rielly. I will definitely be watching that one.   -------------- Interesting thing of Kerry's view. 	  In John Kerry's Own Words:  On Thursday, Senator John Kerry sat down for an interview with ABC News reporter Peter Jennings.  Below is a portion of that interview.  Peter Jennings: "You told an Iowa newspaper recently that life begins at conception. What makes you think that?"  Sen. Kerry: "My personal belief about what happens in the fertilization process is a human being is first formed and created, and that's when life begins. Something begins to happen. There's a transformation. There's an evolution. Within weeks, you look and see the development of it, but that's not a person yet, and it's certainly not what somebody, in my judgment, ought to have the government of the United States intervening in.  Roe v. Wade has made it very clear what our standard is with respect to viability, what our standard is with respect to rights. I believe in the right to choose, not the government choosing, but an individual, and I defend that."  Jennings: "Could you explain again to me what do you mean when you say 'life begins at conception'?"  Kerry: "Well, that's what the Supreme Court has established is a test of viability as to whether or not you're permitted to terminate a pregnancy, and I support that. That is my test. And I, you know, you have all kinds of different evolutions of life, as we know, and very different beliefs about birth, the process of the development of a fetus. That's the standard that's been established in Roe v. Wade. And I adhere to that standard."  Jennings: "If you believe that life begins at conception, is even a first-trimester abortion not murder?"  Kerry: "No, because it's not the form of life that takes personhood in the terms that we have judged it to be in the past. It's the beginning of life. Does life begin? Yes, it begins.  Is it at the point where I would say that you apply those penalties? The answer is, no, and I believe in choice. I believe in the right to choose, and the government should not involve itself in that choice, beyond where it has in the context of Roe v. Wade."  John Kerry's Own Actions:  Kerry Has Voted At Least Six Times Against Banning Partial-Birth Abortion.   Kerry Has Voted At Least 25 Times In Favor Of Using Taxpayer Dollars To Pay For Abortions In United States.  Kerry Voted Against Unborn Victims of Violence Act - "Laci and Connor Peterson's Law"  Nonpartisan National Journal Scored Kerry's Votes Most Liberal In Senate For 2003. Kerry scored a Senate-high 97% liberal rating for 2003, beating out Sens. Barbara Boxer (91), Hillary Clinton (89), Ted Kennedy (88), and Tom Daschle (80). (National Journal Website, "How They Measured Up," http://nationaljournal.com, 2/27/04)  John Kerry says he believes that life begins at conception, yet does not have the conviction to protect life, and instead promotes abortion -- even up until the moment a child takes their first breath!
