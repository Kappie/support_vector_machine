At lease I know how to use the delete key though.. /me looks sideways at bubbles)  Anywho.. Nothing spectacular has really happened since my last splurge of consciousness to this damn blog.  I went over to a friend of Helenas last night and we all watched the Fight Club DVD (Helena hadn't seen it before) and then went home.. Very exciting I know..  Am looking forward to salsa tonight tho, especially since I missed the academy on sunday..  Have also organised to go to my Dads for the weekend, going down on Friday (Yes Bubbles, you can stop sniggering now.. I said "going down") and coming up in time for the Academy on Sunday. That should make for an interesting Blog because Helena is coming down with me (Coming down is probably a better way to phrase it with bubs in the room) and has yet to meet the mayhem that is my father dearest. Also my first time down since I heard that Claire is pregnant (for those that haven't seen the earlier episodes, Claire is my Dad's Girlfriend and explaining the rest will just take too long.. You can read it again  urlLink here . Go have a quick looksie if you are bothered\bored.  Anywho.. Introductions to my mad father and a weekend in cork should make mondays blog a must read event ;)  K, going to go back to being pissed off at my job for a while :-/  Go away now
