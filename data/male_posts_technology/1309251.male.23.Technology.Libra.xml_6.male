Last time I followed orders the messages in the Outlook Express of the manager was deleted and even the back-up was not taken. This time ,it is about the SQL server.I got a mail in my Outlook Express that I have to apply some .bat files and import the Master table.The mail came in the morning and I applied in the evening.I got a SQL server error.I called the administrator in Delhi and told him,that ,I got an attachment and upon application it shows an error.  He bounces back saying that I should have consulted him before doing anything.This happened on 27th May.On 28th the printer stopped talking prints ,I called the printer vendor.He came and diagnosed that ,the printer motor is not working.It seems one of the sales co-ordinators had sent a mail to the zonal co-ordinator and this fellow has mailed the same problem to Banglore head office.This co-ordinator in New Delhi called up immediately ,as soon ,I was issued a notification about the printer. The new tecnology has made my life difficult .He asked me whether the problem is to be locked  by me or by CMS computers.I said ,I had to take the real step.   On 27 th ,I got a chance to see my old colleague,Debjeet Bhattacharya.He was before a chubby faced and fat guy.I had reduced my weight after joining this company.But,this Debu had a large tummy,he had to hold his stomach whenever he had to make any changes in his postures.This is all because of the food from GECIS,Gurgaon.Everyday ,all of the CMS guys catch a bus to their sites,and it takes nearly 2 hours everyday for each us to just reach their destination.Debu has the most convenient of conveyance ,provided by GE.GE provide lunch and conveyance to their employees and support groups.  The life of an outsourced administrator is the worst thing that could happen to a person.I want to change my job profile from the Network/hardware guy to a software development guy.I had a call from my manager ,he says,since,I have a saturday off,I can come and attend the calls for CMS.He says ,there is shortage of field engineers.I have to go to CMS tommorrow.Its tough man.I hope ,I didn 't make a mistake.I should have done this SISL interview better.
