The plane flight was pleasant.  Flew a morning flight into Ft. Lauderdale.  I slept through the vast vast majority of it.  Descent was through storm clouds, and quite a bit of turbulence.Landed, then took a shuttle bus to the Thrifty car rental.  Got our convertible -- a red Chrysler Sebring.  Pretty nice I must say.  Too bad I can't drive it :(.  Humourous anecdote on the shuttle bus.  Apparently United is going with the name "Ted" for some of its flights.  The flight stewards kept commenting "thanks for riding on Ted"... haha... So on the shuttle bus KA and I started joking... "I sure enjoyed my ride on Ted"/"but, my ride on Ted was a little bumpy"/ "yea especially when we were going down".  We were having a great time, like the 12 year olds we really are,  when some women said "there are lots of children on this bus"... blah blah.. I responded saying that she needed to chill with the puritanism.   She responded that she wasn't some kind of conservative, but she didn't think sex should be discussed like it was "nothing".  I responded that we were talking about our flight and that she should get her mind out of the gutter.  hahhahahahaha  Tried to find the beach after we landed, but were given poor directions.  We drove pretty dang far before turning around.  Stopped in Hollywood and got food at a cuban restaurant.  Very tasty!  Sangria was fabulous!  Mmm... fried steak!... Then had desert at a small russian place.  Chocoloate mousse was to die for.  Regardless detours didn't bother me much, as I simply enjoyed looking at the buildings.   Around here they are really neat looking and different.  I think they are Art-Deco.  Love all of the pastels, shades of purple orange and yellow.  Very cool, very interesting.  Everything is so so green!  I thought Virginia was green.   City of Ft. Lauderdale is clean, nice and so close to the ocean, its great.  Ate dinner at Dan Marino's Bar and Grill.  Had some pretty decent drinks, and a very good salad.  A bit expensive, but I'm not worried!  I'm on vacation!  Started our drinking there, and continued at a few bars in downtown Ft. Lauderdale.  Got pretty drunk on tanqueray and tonics.  Cut myself off at some point.  KA was really stressing about meeting women and trying to get laid.  He was being pretty annoying.  I understand that he wants to meet ladies, and have no problem with him doing so.  The issue comes when he blames AD and I for not "helping" him.  I certainly don't mind talking to girls at bars, but its not my most pressing issue -- I mainly just want to hang out with friends, then have a few drinks.   I feel like he is being selfish, and I hope he relaxes a little bit.  Another day, weather looks better.  Think we are going for a run soon.  Maybe we can get out some of his KA's pent up sexual frustration :).  Miss CW.
