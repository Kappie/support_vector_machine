I'm not sure why, but in the dream it was a meeting in a house, and this small paper lunch sack represented a solution to the problem at hand.  Everyone there was very condescending, like I was powerless or not relevant to the action, and I had no skills or ability to give.  I was concentrating on the bag, like an irrational thought that if I could move the bag it would show everyone that I was powerful, that I could solve this problem.  I glared at the hateful bag and (in the dream still) sent a mental 'shove' to escape the inertia of normal physical laws of physics - AND THE BAG LIFTED!  Just for a second, and everyone saw it.  But at the same time, (in the dream) I dropped into semi-conscious trance, a seizure almost, but consciously aware (between sleep and awake) that I am shaking my way back to the bedroom, (struggling to escape the seizure) in my bed finally but still stuck in place, almost like my soul being pulled out of my body against my will.  The dream/seizure finally ends, I am fully awake, heart pounding, mentally checking myself to see what is normal and what's not.  Maybe only 5-10 seconds in awake-time, but it seemed like two minutes since lifting the bag.  I remember having a real, tangible feeling that I actually lifted the object through telekenetic force.  Maybe the strangest dream in many years.  I have not even tried to analyze it, it was just bizarre!
