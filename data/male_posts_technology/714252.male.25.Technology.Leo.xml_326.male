The truth of the matter is that some people aren't worth the hastle they cause and as such they can push people to do things that they don't want to do. With that in mind I will strengthen my resolve and post a clarification of my earlier posts.  Anyone has a problem with that they can write me a letter.  (Yes I have checked since, Texts are not admisable in court and are not accepted as official\legal documentation)  One more thing, I had a problem with someone and I wrote it on my blogs. I did not contact anyone closely related to that person. I didn't advertise the fact I had a problem. I just wrote it in my web diary.  Someone rang my co-worker and then went on to ring my Girl-Friend. In the greater scheme of things they left messages on the phones of people that affect my life directly and voiced their opinions on me. Libel Damage wise I am apparently winning the case right there. (Did I mention I was checking up on these issues myself..)  So said, I'm not a small minded bitter person and I have no intention so far of pursuing these matters. However, my Girlfriend is out of bounds as far as I am concerned and if anyone (Present or future) uses my girlfriend to try and get to me I won't accept it and I will not just let it go.  Enough said
