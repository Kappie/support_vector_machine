Pablo was one of Columbia's (if not the) most powerful drug kingpin back in the 90s. This book provided me food for thought on several issues. It gave me an overview of how drugs can seriously hurt another country, both economically and socially. It was estimated that even around or after Pablo's death, the US population would still spend a whooping $30.8 billion on cocaine alone. We must never ever allow such a situation to come to pass in Singapore. It is good that we have a stiff death sentence (though I don't think that human rights activist would agree).  The book also showed the extent of US involvement (covert and overt). The Bush administration had viewed the illegal import of cocaine from Columbia to be important enough to re-interpret certain laws and regulations to make it NOT illegal for US forces to pursue a foreign national. Besides providing training, equipment, intelligence, money, etc, special units such as Delta Force were sent in as well under the pretext of training law enforcement agencies and to act as support aid to the Columbian government. Rumours of Delta Force involvement in raids were never verified.  Columbia's government do not have enough support from its own people. People are only concerned about their own well-being. When illegal bombings and assasinations started taking its toll on the civilian population, they were quick to show their displeasure. This is a huge question mark for me with regards to Singapore. I'd like to believe that our own people will be able to hold out and not give in to such pressure, but knowing how selfish human beings can get...  During the period of the hunt, rival drug cartels (enemies of Pablo) would make deals with the local government. Even the US quietly turned a blind eye, knowing that intelligence they provided would sometimes be used by some of these people to carry out attacks on Pablo and his associates. They adopted a 'as-long-as-I-didn't-see-it-even-though-I-know-about-it' attitude. I can understand that how sometimes it may be necessary to make deals with evil to destroy an even greater evil. But as history would prove it, what happens is that in the process of making deals with criminals, they create an even more horrible monster in the process. Sometimes the phrase "the ends Justify the Means" isn't necessarily Right, but it sure was effective. In this case, it was a shortcut for the US and Columbians to bring down Pablo Escobar. This however, corrupted the cause. Originally intended to be minimise the amount of drugs smugggled into the US, it soon became a simple hunt for just one man (with only indirect links to the drug issue).  Sometimes guidelines and laws aren't just words in the Constitution of a country. They provide a basic moral code for which the government (and its people) should operate. It's also important to maintain integrity and keep focused on the main issue at hand.   Conclusion?  I once felt very strongly that the ends justify the means. To maintain a level of integrity in handling matters may seem foolish, slow and impractical but that compared to selling/losing your own soul is a small price to pay.
