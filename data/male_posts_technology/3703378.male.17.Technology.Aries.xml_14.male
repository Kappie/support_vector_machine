I went through depression HELL for about 8 months, but now I am back to my coooool bad self! ^_^ Over the weekend I moved my dad out into his apartment, which is in Hampton, and did some heavy lifting with the furniture. My brother helped too, but I feel kinda sad since we did everything on Father's Day. On Father's Day, which was Sunday, I went to the movies with my dad, bro, and Chris...we saw Dodgeball with Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn...and it was HILARIOUS! Go see it if you can...anyway...My mom dropped me off at work today, and I'm just chillin til I get my next cluster of work (I'm a hard worker..HUA!) Umm...Before my mom dropped me off, she menchined that she bought a Mitsubishi 3000GT! I need to contact Chris, because this car is very well going to be mine...I must see if I can rice it out or do anything to it to really make it something else...perhaps add a turbo, sound system, body kit, and a faster engine!...We'll see what happens...buuuut...My dad was planning on giving me the Honda, however, it works for him...I don't know whats happening! Welp..bai bai you'all!
