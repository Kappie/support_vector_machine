Bullshit  They don’t think of themselves as strong believers, but they allow the possibility—they say that we all must. Yet they lean towards theism. That is itself a belief without knowledge. They don’t *know* that there is a God. Indeed, no one can offer any externally verifiable proof, yet they all still believe. So why can’t I believe that there is no God? If their belief does not rely on any proof why must  mine?   And there‘s the rub. They invented the God, they made up the rules. Like a child’s game they change the rules whenever things don’t go their way. Look at the argument carefully and you find that for them, belief is a result of some external force, some spiritual entity graces them with faith, with belief. How can one have belief without the external entity? To them, one cannot. But when you start to peel away their argument you see that it is circular: belief is required in order to have belief. God must exist in order to give us belief in God.   Strip out their catch-22 and we are left with belief as a hope that what we want to be true is or will be, in fact, true. Anyone can believe anything, it is how we survive the uncertainty of the future. We don't know if we will die on our way home from work tonight, we drive because we believe that we will not. I don't do good things because I believe that God will reward me, I do them because there is no God and if we don't take care of each other then no one will.  There is no God. I know it.
