They removed one yesterday and don't know if it'd malignant yet, but they think it is so she'll most likely be stuck in chemotherapy. I'm so glad that she's close to Sherrie (my Youth Leader's wife), as Sherrie went through cancer earlier in her life too. Please be praying for her and her family in this hard time.
