Or are my eyes just showing me a glimpse of the flame we once shared A flame long extinguished in your soul, but burning strong in mine  You’ve found new love I guess it’s time for me to do the same But before I go Thank you For everything Thank you for me And most of all, Thank you for this lesson  I know I’ll be seeing you again Only now through different eyes You have nothing more to offer me So consider this last Thank You- Goodbye.
