Usually I dread these gatherings because I just don't feel safe letting people past the outer defenses (hence the army of plastic cats - see my profile).  It is also hard for me to make trivial small talk, because it seems so trite and meaningless and silly.  So I end up mentally isolating myself from everyone else around me, internally retreating into a safe little cocoon where I can still be myself.  I can be totally, utterly alone in a room full of acquaintences, or even friends.    I remember my friends threw a suprise party for me when I turned 21, but even then I can remember feeling very alone for a few minutes.  Even though I was being shown by people that they liked and cared for me, I could not fully accept their feelings, as if at any moment they would all turn around and say "we made it all up, we don't really like you", the pig's blood would drop on me (image from  Carrie ), etc.  Someone sensed I was drifting away, and they came to me and physically/emotionally pulled me back into the present moment where they I did not have to be alone.  That has happened several times, and then other times I would desparately wish someone, whether a friend, or a "crush", would read my mind and come rescue me (because I would not tell them), but they never did.    Illogical line of reasoning # 325:    I feel like I have to constantly test others' love for me, and that if I don't constantly hear them telling me or feel the love, I start to question it.  If they do tell me or show me they love me, I start to question their sincerity or motives or intelligence.  I want love, but when I get it, I feel unworthy, so I must test their love, then when I get the answer that I want, I don't believe it.  If for some reason the other person doesn't respond the way I think they should, that confirms that they don't really love me.     I see how illogical this line of reasoning is.  If i can just learn to accept others' love, freely given, because they feel I deserve it, that should make me accept myself and like myself a little more.  I just cannot get past this fear of people being disingenuous, or betrayal, or someone's lack of ability to love me.  Hows that for a fear, kids?  I am afriad that someone doesn't love me because they are so messed up they may not have the capacity to love me, therefore I am not worthy of anyone's love.  Without realizing it, I accidentally/subconsciously wrote "fear of being left alone".  Is that all it is, just a fear that something will happen to everyone around me, and I will be left alone to cope (or not), whether by death, divorce, don't like/love me, or catastrophe, or ___?  I often tell myself I want to be alone, but deep down I really don't.  Deep down I want to be able to let people like or love me, to be able to accept and reflect those feelings, and to feel safe in letting people see a little bit of my emotional self.  How can I get over this fear?  I don't know...
