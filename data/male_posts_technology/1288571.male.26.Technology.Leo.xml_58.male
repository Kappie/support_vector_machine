They've announced pricing structures but I'll save me tons of typing by giving you  urlLink this URL . It breaks it all down for you but here it is in a nutshell. Beta members get a flat fee of $30. This includes a lifetime membership to There and all the premium services. If you're NOT a beta member, you have to pay $30 for an activation fee, and $10 a month. This doesn't include the premium services.  What does this mean for you?  If you  urlLink sign up now  and use me as a referral (Northstar), you don't have to wait in line to get approved to enter the current beta. Since you'll be moved up to the front of the line, you'll be able to take advantage of this amazing beta offer! Yes I get something out of it for referring you (Therebucks, the in game currency) BUT you get by far the better deal. No monthly fees. No extra fees for premium services. $30 USD. Period.  So if you wanted to sign up to try it out, do it now. What do you have to lose? It's free currently, and there'll be no waiting line to get accepted if you put in my name (Northstar) as a referral.  If you like it, take advantage of this amazing deal for beta testers!  Oh, I almost forgot  urlLink the magic picture.   Cya!
