Now I have committed my ideas to paper, staked out the areas, and know the features I am going to install. The place will be pretty 'raw' the rest of this year but the construction will be in place and ready for next year to be started on time.   I am adding a small pond for effect and for the wildlife. The herb garden will be distinct from the vegetable garden. The back bed of the vegetable garden (4'x40') will be set up for cutting flowers. Despite the mission of Frog Pond to be "native" in its plantings, a little fancy flowers make the place look nice!   New animals and birds were seen this week. Cedar wax-wings and killdeer are new to my sightings here. The hummingbirds are in full action at the feeder and the bird boxes are fledging nests. Summer is upon us at Frog Pond!   The first tomatoes are set on the vines in the garden and the beans are blossomed. The pumpkin vines are growing well and all in all things seem to be doing fine. A little rain this week would be nice.
