Not because of any unhappy stuff in fact they got one of the most wonderful bosses i ever come across in my life time. Really nice people I mean it.   But because of better opportunities out there, I have to think for my own future as well. Yes my company is going relive with a couple of factors coming in together. It is a matter of factors that come together at the correct timing resulted in me leaving my current company. If I miss this opportunity, I might have to wait for some more time and I will grab it tightly else I will regret over it again. I missed a couple and I do not want to miss it again.  This is kind of stress for me as I can no longer be so extravagant on my spending because everything do matters now. Also a time to build my discipline and control. Let's wish me all the best to my future endeavour!   It's not about how many times you fell, it's about how you able to climb back everytime you fell. ---  The Unknown
