I just found it while clearly out some old text files on  my Palm. It sounds a really good game, I think it's still going, so maybe  a few of us should give it a try?          ---          Volumes have already been written about real life,  the most accessible and most widely accepted massively multiplayer online  role-playing game to date. Featuring believable characters, plenty of lasting  appeal, and a lot of challenge and variety, real life is absolutely  recommendable to those who've grown weary of all the cookie-cutter games that  have tried to emulate its popularity--or to just about anyone, really.    Real life is densely populated and features a wide variety of  places to explore and activities to engage in.         Real life isn't above reproach. In one of the  stranger design decisions in the game, for some reason you have no choice in  determining your character's initial starting location, appearance, or gender,  which are chosen for you seemingly at random. However, over the course of your  character's life, you have tremendous opportunity to customize and define a  truly unique appearance for yourself--not only can you fine-tune your hairstyle  and hair color, but you can also purchase and wear a seemingly infinite variety  of clothing and influence your body type using various in-game mechanisms. For  example, if your character exercises frequently, you will appear fit and  muscular. You may also choose from a huge variety of tattoos and body piercings,  and later you can even pay for cosmetic surgery, though this is expensive and  there's a small chance that the operation will backfire. At any rate, real life  offers a truly remarkable amount of variety in determining your character's  outward appearance, and this depth isn't only skin deep. The only problem is  you're relegated to playing as a human character, though the game does randomly  choose one of several different races for you (which have little bearing on  gameplay and mostly just affect appearances and your standing with certain  factions).         The gameplay itself is extremely open-ended, though  it's structured in such a way that you'll have a fairly clear path to follow  when you're just starting out. Real life features a great system whereby newbie  players will automatically be guided along through the early levels by one or  more "parent" characters who elect to take newbie characters under their wing.  This is a great system, as these older, more-experienced characters reap their  own benefits from doing a good job of guiding the newbie character along. The  system does have some problems, though--sometimes you'll encounter "griefer"  parents who shirk their responsibilities or, even worse, seem content to harass  newbie players. Such a situation could, in theory, irreparably damage your  experience in real life. Fortunately, chances of this are relatively slim, as a  harsh punitive system is in place to prevent the vast majority of players from  experiencing or engaging in this sort of behavior.   Starting out in  real life can admittedly be boring, but the experience becomes much more  interesting and open-ended once you get past the learning curve.         Typically, a character will learn of the numerous  viable career paths available by undergoing schooling. This can be a long and  tedious process, equivalent to the sort of "level treadmill" monotony that  characterizes almost all MMORPGs. Nevertheless, many players do manage to enjoy  themselves in this phase, especially if they band together--real life definitely  rewards players who join groups, though soloing is certainly an option as well.  At any rate, through the schooling process, as you engage in various activities,  you eventually settle on a career path, and this is when you can start making a  good amount of money and really taking matters into your own hands.          There are a few known exploits for making money,  but generally the game's financial system is well balanced, complex, and  rewarding for those who put forth proportionally more effort. You can use money  to acquire new and better clothing, your own custom housing (a tremendous  variety of options are available here as well), and new means of transportation  ranging from bicycles to automobiles and beyond, and you can even employ other  players and some non-player characters to do your bidding. Most notably, certain  actions in real life are necessary and yet require a considerable amount of  expertise to perform, or are simply boring. Additionally, even if you do have  expertise in a field, that doesn't mean you can perform a given task for  yourself--in this way, real life encourages and even forces player interaction,  so those who prefer to go solo might find themselves in a bind at times. For  example, even if your character specializes in dentistry, that doesn't mean you  can perform a root-canal operation on yourself. Fortunately, dentistry is one of  many lucrative professions in real life, and its practitioners can easily afford  to pay for the various required maintenance tasks, freeing up their own free  time for more-interesting activities.         One issue with real life is that it gives you very  little specific feedback on character advancement. To give a couple of examples,  a highly proficient player might receive a sudden pay raise or might become a  champion boxer, but there's no clear way to tell exactly how smart or how strong  you really are. Cleverly, there are in-game ways of at least getting a sense of  these and other key attributes. You may attempt to lift weights to roughly  determine how your strength compares with that of other characters. Various  tests are available to gauge your overall intellect and expertise and knowledge  in a variety of fields, though annoyingly, you need to pay a considerable fee to  take some of these--and if you fail, often you aren't allowed to retake the exam  for a while, or sometimes at all.   Players can learn to operate a  variety of different vehicles, and they can choose from a great variety of  professions.         The game's player-run economy and well-balanced  career system are extremely well done, but similar to what's found in other  games. On the other hand, a particularly innovative aspect of real life is the  way it forces you to gain certification to use certain objects. This feels much  less contrived than the level caps or class restrictions found in other games  (there are no "levels" or "experience points" per se in real life), and it also  prevents players who "twink" money from their parents from automatically getting  access to all the best facilities and equipment--though it's certainly true that  players of good parentage have an inherent and arguably unfair advantage.  Nevertheless, it's standard practice to have to qualify for certain professions,  to engage in certain activities, to use certain equipment, and so forth. This  system is quite modular. For example, even if you've become certified to drive a  motorcycle, that doesn't automatically qualify you to drive an automobile.          This example is evidence of some of the amazing  depth offered by real life--there are so many different options and viable  decisions for a character to make that it's just about impossible for any one  character to see everything and visit all the colorful and sometimes dangerous  locations. Unlike in other MMORPGs, combat actually isn't a major factor for  most players in real life, though players are bound to engage in a few  skirmishes early in their lives. Interestingly, though, real life does offer an  amazingly intricate combat system, featuring complex hand-to-hand and ranged  combat options that a character may learn and even specialize in.         Combat-oriented characters lead exciting but  sometimes short lives in real life.         That being the case, you'd think more players would  be drawn to combat in real life, and in some territories, they are. However, the  PVE (player vs. environment) aspect of real life is relatively unpopular, and  the PVP (player vs. player) portion, while interesting, is far too risky for  most of the population. That's on account of the game's very strict death  penalty and punitive system--you may freely attempt to harm or kill any other  player at any time, but you will then likely be heavily punished by the game's  player-run authorities. The punitive system has loopholes and other problems,  allowing certain players to elude punishment and continue to engage in various  player-killing activities. But for the most part, real life does a good enough  job of making the punishment fit the crime, as it were, so in most regions  there's a relative sense of order.         Player death is a serious issue in real life, and  cause for continued debate among players, who often direct unanswerable  questions on the subject to the game's developers, who are apparently (and  understandably) so busy that they generally keep silent. In short, players who  die--at the hands of other players, by the occasional environmental hazard, or  when their account expires--are essentially removed from the gameworld and  apparently cannot return at all. This further discourages players from engaging  in PVP combat, but it does help real life's rapidly growing player population  from getting too out of hand (though eventually there will be a need for  additional servers).         Player groups can achieve incredible success in  ways you wouldn't expect, and that helps keep real life fresh and interesting.          Real life looks incredible, to say the least. To be  sure, certain areas appear drab and colorless, even unpleasantly so. But some of  the outdoor environments and even some of the player-made urban settings are  truly a sight to behold, and various environmental and weather effects only add  to the charm. The character models, meanwhile, are as impressive and detailed as  they are varied. Some are incredibly striking and beautiful, while others appear  hideously ugly--it's great that you can more or less decide for yourself on  which side of the spectrum you wish to be. Real life also features some of the  most believable ambient effects and footstep sounds to date, and it offers an  incredible variety of music for good measure. In one of the game's best touches,  players can actually compose, conduct, and perform their own music, and this is  viable either for solo players or for groups. Especially skilled musicians go on  to become some of the wealthiest and most popular characters around. The music  career path is more complex and challenging than you'd expect, and it's another  one of real life's really impressive and well-implemented features. One of the  coolest experiences in the game is in traveling to different regions and  listening to how different the music sounds for that territory. For that matter,  architecture and even player languages differ depending on region.    Real life can occasionally feel like a chore. Some players  legitimately dislike it, despite having attempted and even excelled at numerous  career paths. Others externalize their frustrations by harming other players or,  in some cases, even harming themselves. These players do have access to various  support forums, and often end up whiling away the time by engaging in various  available minigames or other competitive activities. Socializing is always an  option, and as with other online RPGs, real life is certainly at its most  rewarding when you manage to find and consort with other like-minded companions.  At any rate, it's hard to fault the game for lack of content or viable  activities, and even when certain players try to subvert the system or harm  others, it still makes for some exciting and spontaneous events for other  players who happen to be in the area or just hear of the event. Beyond that,  real life can indeed be very time-consuming, and some of the less exciting  moments, such as when your character is tired or injured, can be annoyingly so.          It's also true that real life is constantly being  refined. Some players argue that many of the numerous changes constantly being  made are for the worse--for example, players running once-profitable tobacco  companies, as well as the players who are addicted to using popular tobacco  products, often complain that the tobacco business is being "nerfed" for no good  reason. But either way, it's good to know that players are able to actively  improve certain features that require finer tuning. This keeps the developers  free to focus on bigger issues.         Ultimately, if you take a step back and look at the  big picture, you'll see that real life is an impressive and exciting experience,  despite its occasional and sometimes noticeable problems. It says a lot for real  life that, even with these issues, it's still very highly recommendable. Simply  put, those missing out on real life are doing just that.
