However, I had a couple of thing happen today which I really am now questioning.      Karissa (while we were playing in the pool) said to me I want to give you a kiss daddy.  So I let her and she tried to French Kiss me!  I asked her what she was doing and she said trying to kiss like mommy!  I had to explain to her why she should not be kissing daddy or other people that way which is hard to explain to a 4 YO. For that matter I should not have to explain it!    Karissa went upstairs today and was upstairs reading her books.  I went downstairs to clean the kitchen and she came down and said "daddy I went potty and got poopy on my underpants because I did not wipe good".  I said OK go in the potty so we can finish.  Well when I got in there she acted like the world was going to end.  "Sorry daddy I didn't mean to!  I am really sorry!  Don't be mad at me!  I told her she did not need to be sorry and it was OK it was an accident.     Normally this would not bother me but yesterday when we were at Stacee and Rob's she could not find the potty and ended up peeing in her pants on the floor downstairs.  Again not a major issue but she acted the same way almost the same verbage.  Again I told her it was OK she did not know where the potty was and I would just wash her clothes and clean up the mess.  Then last week she did the same while she was here with Rick.  She had gone potty in her pants.  She did the same kind of routine with him.  He just told her that is why they call them accidents right?  She thought that was funny and all was well.  You know   SFW   even said in her deposition that she feels she should have custody of Karissa because she has had parenting classes and and understands children.  I will admit I have made mistakes as a parent.  I don't know a person who has not but I have had parenting classes as well. In fact   SFW   and I took a couple of them together.  But to see the look of fear on Karissa's face because of the bathroom thing and the french kiss thing really pisses me off and concerns me.  For someone who understands children Karissa sure seems scared when accidents happen.     SFW   says Karissa is happy and well adjusted and for the most part I would agree but to see these things coming out lead me to believe not all is great for Karissa.  And the system is against me isn't that some shit!
