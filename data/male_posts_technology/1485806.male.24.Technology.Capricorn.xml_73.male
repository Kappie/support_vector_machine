I have just recently read ChristFreek urlLink    's blog and have stumbled on this site which have a list of really funny phrases in Aramaic which is the language of Jesus 's time.  Most of these phrases directly are the feedbacks received when watching Passion Of Christ movie  urlLink      The title meant this: Brilliant! I can't wait for the sequel (second coming)  Some of the comedic feedbacks which are incidentally translated into Aramaic to relate with the movie's language and theme. For those who have watched Passion of Christ, will be able to relate with it and yeah hope it tickles your heart. heheheh  Some of the brilliant ones are as follows  Baseem, ellaa saabar naa d-etstebeeth yateer b-Lebeh d-Gabaaraa!  Not bad, but I think I preferred Braveheart  Aykaa beyt tadkeetha? Zaadeq lee d-asheeg eeday men perdey devshaanaayey haaleyn!  Where is the loo? I need to wash my hands of this popcorn.   Demketh! Udamaa lemath mtaynan b-tash'eetha d-khashey?  I fell asleep! What station of the cross are we up to?   Ktaabaa taab hwaa  meneyh.  It's not as good as the book  Puuee men Preeshey, puuee!  Boo, Pharisees! Boo!   D-tetbuun deyn men yameen u-men semaal, la hwaat deel l-metal, ellaa l-ayleyn da-mtaybaa. To sit at my right or my left is not for me to grant; it is for those to whom it has already been assigned  Eeth lee 'ayney, ellaa layt lee d-ekhzey la-kteebaataa takhtaayaataa. Neqruuv leh?  I have eyes but I cannot see the subtitles. Can we sit closer?   Laa, haw Shem'uun Qooreenaayaa eethaw! Ezdar!  No, that's Simon of Cyrene! Pay attention!   Waay! Haw 'aalmeenaayaa hwaa!  Well, that was eternal  In case there someone out there accuses the movie as Anti Semitism, here is one feedback that will revert it all.  Enaa mqatreg naa l-Ruumaayey. I blame the Romans  Een, Yuudaayaa naa, ellaa b-haw yawmaa laa hweeth ba-mdeetaa.  Yes, I'm Jewish, but I wasn't there that day    We kept some of the best for the last which deserves our best awards to these feedbacks.  Etheeth l-khubeh 'almeenaayaa d-Maaran Yeshu Msheekhaa, ella faasheth metool Moneeqaa Belluushee!  I came for the everlasting love of our Lord Jesus Christ, but I stayed for Monica Bellucci.   Ayleyn enuun Oorqey? Which ones are the Orcs?   Lebba deel daaleq, ellaa teezaa deel daamek. My heart is on fire, but my bum is asleep.   Note: that all this is in the name of fun and pokes fun at the movie and not at the message of the movie or the characters..
