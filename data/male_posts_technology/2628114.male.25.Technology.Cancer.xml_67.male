What a wonderful day to sit by the pool or sit anywhere and not run.  Since I had to run, I decided to try my hand at some trail running.  I got to experience Ault Park for the first time ever and I was very impressed with the amount of trails and sidetrails and get-horribly-lost trails there were in that little expanse of woods.  I set out and found the same railroad tracks about 14 times while I ran in circles and dodged some huge snake that scared the bejesus out of me and up and down hills in the process.  I would have to rate Ault Park trails a step behind Red River Gorge trails in difficulty, but not that far behind at all!  The hills and extreme terrain of some of the sidetrails of Ault Park were just as difficult as RRG.  I made it to the top of Ault Park with the cool overlook thing and pretty gardens and had a nice, little, romantic moment with the flowers or something but kept right on running and sweating.  I had to stop to walk a significant amount due to the heat, hills, and for water at the top and I probably ran under 6 miles but I certainly accomplished a lot to run as far as I did today.  For a final thought today, a song that made me laugh on the way home due to its wonderful application to my run today. Round, round, round we go.  Training starts next week, Tuesday to be exact.  Wheee!  18 weeks until the NYC marathon!  Have a great 4th of July weekend!
