They held this truth so dear that they were willing to suffer torture and death rather than renounce it.   This startling message so electrified their ministry that their testimony "turned the world upside down" (Acts 17:6). It is still true today: The Holy Spirit honors the witness of those who proclaim the resurrected Jesus.
