Jennifer Anniston - She'll always be Rachel to me.   4.  Christine Taylor - Dodgeball moved her up onto the list.   5.  Kelly Ripa - Hot, smart, and funny?  Sign me up.      Fallen off:   Courtney Cox - The number one for an untold number of years, displaced at last.  Although she is currently holding the top spot on the Over 40 Top 5.   Jessica Alba - As hot as the come, but I heard her talk.  Wow....   Jennifer Love Hewitt - Just delightful, she is still hanging around in the Top 10
