They also make great demands on his time - even if he succeeds in analyzing his time and in controlling whatever can be controlled.  Effective executives know what they expect to get out of a meeting, a report or a presentation and what the purpose of the occassion is or should be. They ask themselves: "Why are we having this meeting? Do we want a decision, do we want to inform, or do we want to make clear to ourselves what we should be doing?" They insist that the purpose be thought through and spelled out before a meeting is called, a report asked for, or a presentation organized. They insist that the meeting serve the contribution to which they have committed themselves.      The effective man always states at the outset of a meeting the specific purpose and contribution     it is to achieve. He makes sure that the meeting addresses itself to this purpose. He does not     allow a meeting called to inform to degenerate into a 'bull session' in which everyone has bright     ideas. But a meeting called by him to stimulate thinking and ideas also does not become simply a     presentation on the part of one of the members, but is run to challenge and stimulate everybody     in the room. He always, at the end of his meetings, goes back to the opening statement and     relates the final conclusions to the original intent.  There are other rules for making a meeting productive (for instance, the obvious but disregarded rule that one can either direct a meeting and listen for the important things being said, or one can take part and talk; one cannot do both) But the cardinal rule is to focus it from the start on contribution."
