So I had my company xmas party last night....it was at the Agenda (place where the young and pretty people hang out...not me) which is this kinda night clubby thing....anyway....the people I work with have come to expect me to get into fine form at these types of events.....given that i have a people pleasing mentality.....i didn't let them down!  I arrived by taxi....with 4 other drunk ass foolz.  Our cabby was the coolest dood...too many people for the seat belts...we all had booze in us and with us and he let us have full control of the radio!!!!!  This man is truly a pirate after my own heart.  So the xmas party feels like it lasted about 5 minutes.........we get there.....and the next thing i know...all my co workers had bugged out and it was my drunk ass dancin on the empty dance floor (this happens often).  After the gig, I meet up with a few peeps at the my apartment...few bowls later, we decide that 12:00 on a school night is no time to quit....cause quittinz for pussies!  That said...we were off to my local watering hole.  We close the place down haven gotten even more drunk....by now....i could sell my piss as Jack Daniels.  I must of had a "cute night" because one chick gave me her card (would never call her but it feelz good to be hit on for sure) and another chick had me back to her car for a biznowl with her brother (who i had to assure that I didn't want into his sister's pants....which is a true statement.......he was drunk n volitole).  By now its 2 am....i'm alll kinds of fucked up....walkn home....a buddy i'm hanging with tackles my ass....on my back.....both legs get folded under me...all you hear is a big crunch...both knees....fucked!  Of course....i lay an ass whooping....but i wasn't able to stand for a few minutes.....  So after some more bowlz and some madden.....its 3:30 on a thursday....and its time for bed.  I'm so sore today....kness so fucked up...feel like an old man.....head is spinning.....i'm sure my company's stock will go up today on account of my productivity alone!  ;o)
