Niether did I know that I 've a poet dormant in me Nor did I know that there is a loverboy within me longing always to find his missing rib !  I'll sum it allwith following verses,    Thought About You...  All day long,I thought about you.        Even when I tried not to think about you,    I thought about you.        When I closed my eyes,    I thought about you.        When I opened my eyes,    I thought about you.        When I thought about the beauty of the season,    I thought about you.        When I thought about the warmth of the upcoming holidays,    I thought about you.        When I heard a love song on the radio,    I thought about you.        When I checked my email,    I thought about you.        Even when I said goodnight to the stars,    I thought about you.        And when I slipped beneath the softness of my blanket    and gave in to the bliss of sweet dreams,    I thought about you.          I just can't stop thinking aboutU !      I need to repeat a famous Quote of mine -     "Love is a Painful Bliss"
