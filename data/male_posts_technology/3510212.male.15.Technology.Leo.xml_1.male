My first day at the new job went pretty well; I went on a service call with an older employee, then helped repair an old 90MHz doorstop when we got back from that.  My neighbor also got an ancient PC, his was only 75MHz. I tried to get it to work, but it needs a windows reinstall, and it won't boot from a CD, and when it boots from a disk, the monitor goes blank after POST.  Anyway...  The next day went pretty well too. I stayed in the shop, and worked on quite a few. I reinstalled windows 2000 on a laptop, got the printer to work on the same 90MHz PC, and started to reinstall 98 on another PC.  Right now, I'm about to go for a bike ride, then I'll go into work.
