Well, thats how they've always been cooled! But have you heard of a water-cooled PSU??  Apparently one guy has hit upon this brilliant  (though it remains to be seen how safe!)  idea of colling the PSU in your PCs using plain old water! He even provides an illustrated step-by-step guide on how to go about doing that! You can click  urlLink here  to check out the ste-by-step guide.  But... but... but!... make it a point to read the  warning  and the  disclaimer  to literally avoid a  urlLink Digital Explosion ! :-)  [via  urlLink Slashdot ]
