Not a major update I guess, but as I have yet to look around for something good to write about I figured I might as well do something.  To start with, as a few of you may know, I have started back at college. I'm on my second week of a six week, three credit class. To my surprise I actually like being back in school. Well this class currently has me working on one essay and a longer-term essay. The essay is a process essay discussing the Rational Unified Process (RUP). Basically, this is a general process by which software is planned and designed.  The research project is an argumentive paper discussing the problems with the DMCA such as how it prevents researchers, programmers along with many others from reverse engineering, circumventing security and/or finding holes in software and reporting or publishing papers on such research if they do decide to do it anyway. Several people have so far served cease and decist orders, arrested, charged and extridited under the broad blanket statements of the DMCA.  I'm also making some progress on a program I am working on in my free time (like I have any). I've been getting a lot of it reorganized here and there and some new parts written. I'm about to get to the point where I need to start working on the printing interface for it.  Well, that's about all I got for now. I'll probably post more later on when I get a chance.    -intX    stab stab stab!
