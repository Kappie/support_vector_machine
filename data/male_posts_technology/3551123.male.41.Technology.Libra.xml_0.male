It was another one of those mornings, why couldn’t that bitch just shut up?  He reflexively reached to his top left pocket for his smokes which was about the only pleasure he had left in life, and then realized for the third time in the ten minutes he had been careening down the highway that he smoked his last one in the kitchen, thrusting it in the air to accentuate his point, he had to get his point across, because God knows if he didn’t beat it into her head she wouldn’t understand a damn thing.  Why did he have to do everything?  And, as usual, she just stood there, head bent in submission as if he was going to hit her, he never had so why did she do that, but sometimes he got close, so close, so those times he usually punched something else, although since the last time he broke his hand he was trying really hard not to do that anymore.  But today he did put his cigarette out in the middle of the kitchen with that godforsaken tablecloth that cost him $100 of his hard earned money.  What the hell was that woman thinking?  A honk brought him back to the present, temporarily out of his rage.  The honk appeared again, more insistent this time, and he realized that the light had changed to green and he didn’t notice.  With an explicative, he punched the gas as the horn went even again.  “You do NOT want to mess with ME today!”, he yelled towards the rear at the green Japmobile he saw through the rear window as his vehicle lurched through the stoplight as it was turning yellow.  A slight smile crossed his lips.  “That’s what you get for honking at me”, he thought, but the smile quickly changed to a frown as he saw his nemesis glide nonchalantly through the red light.  “You’re an idiot”,. he yelled again into the rear mirror this time, noticing in his peripheral vision that everyone ahead of him had stopped, and if he didn’t react real soon, he was going to take a number of them out.  In a panic, he overreacted and slammed on the brakes much harder than necessary which caused his tires to lock and cause a real ruckus and all of his stuff in the front seat to fly onto the floorboard.  “S_________!”, he yelled as he instinctively reached out to catch something before it was all scattered in the vehicle.  “S_________, s__________, s_________”, leaning over and realizing that due to the size of his vehicle and the size of his paunch there was no way he was not going to be able to reach anything until he stopped, and he was not stopping before he got to work.  He leaned his head back, closed his eyes, and took a deep long breath.  When was it going to end?  “Hey mister!”  As he tried to remember how many breaths his relaxation tapes at home told him to take to calm down, he heard it again.  “Hey you, fat boy!”  He slowly opened his eyes as he let out a long breath, and began to scan from right to left as much of his surroundings as he could from his high perch.  As he finally looked out of his left window, he saw the same green Japmobile immediately to his left, and he saw a very scrawny and very young red head with a white freckled face looking up at him from the passenger side of the green car.  “What did you learn to drive, you fat asshole?”  He did not immediately reply, the situation was too surreal for his brain to register right away.  Was she really talking to him?  “Yeah, I was talking to you, you porker.  What the hell is your problem.”  her small mouth with very red lipstick said.  And then it hit him, a sudden burning sensation encompassed his brain like a flash fire, and almost involuntarily he ripped his seatbelt off his generous girth and opened the door to get out.  The girls head immediately popped back into the green car, and frantically began to crank the window up.  He had lost control, and there was nothing he could do now but finish what he had started.  As he stepped down, he felt a pop in the left side of his head, and then he felt himself falling like he stepped on a sheet of thin wet ice.  He never felt himself hit the pavement.
