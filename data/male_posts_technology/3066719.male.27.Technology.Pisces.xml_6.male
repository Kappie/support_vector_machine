       
       Intimations of Immortality       Ye that through your hearts to-day      Feel the gladness of the May!   What though the radiance which was once so bright     Be now for ever taken from my sight,   Though nothing can bring back the hour     Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;   We will grieve not, rather find     Strength in what remains behind   (William Wordsworth)
