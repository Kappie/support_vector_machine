We (Noel and Richard- my cousins, Andy and James and Helen) got into poole on thursday night and drove to Bournemoth where we got pissed and stayed in a guest house, however I think it was a bit of a strange guest house as they provided piss sheets in the adults beds as well as the childrens!!! Thanks to these piss sheets we got a fairly unrestful night as we were bathing in our own sweat! (not very nice).  So on Friday we drove to the event at Santa Pod, a raceway built on an old American airbase from WW2. That evening we headed out on the Muscle Car Tour, where all the American Muscle Cars drive 'en mass' through Poddington, a very cool sight. The only downer of the day was that it had rained from 6am the previous day until about 5pm now!  Saturday saw the event kick off the drag racing, and believe me...standing next the the cars as they roar down a quarter mile straight, engines kicking out 1500bhp and more!!  I knew pretty much nothing about cars when I went, but I have learnt a great deal and it has awoken a new appreciation for muscle cars that I never thought possible.  Saturday night we all chilled out in the beer tent and watched the live band, the lead singer of which has a car that would make the 'Minden Place Massive' shit their pants!!  Sunday saw a dryer day and the burnout competition...YAY!  Also on Sunday we saw the third run of 'Fireforce'- the jet car. This beast can do a quarter of a mile in around 7 seconds, thats moving man!!! However, on it's third run, as they were priming the system on the starter grid, their fuel lines burst, sending fuel all over the place which was a bit unnerving hehe!  The event ended on Sunday night and Richard, Andy, James and I drove back to Bournemoth, the rest had headed home the day before due to work. When we got there we headed out on the piss and had an indian dinner, which I have to admit, broke me!!!  On Monday we had to catch the boat home at 4pm, so we did the I-max theatre (a 3d glasses cinema) which was cool. We also went on the 'Bournemoth Eye', this being a 450ft high helium balloon which permanently soars in the air, only it get winched down to let people on. This seemed like a total waste of time as we waited an hour and a half just to get on.....but it was SOOOOO worht it!  This thing is meant to operate safely in wind speeds up to 30 knots...however, when we got to the top (just the four of us) the balloon guy said to hold on as the wind speed was up to 34 knots!! At this point the balloon was bobbing around nicely hahaha! We spent ten hair raising minute up there (video to come hopefully) and then we came down and raced to our boat ahlf an hour later in Poole.  All in all a great trip, that I will be going on again next year! Oh and I have started a new photo album in the photo room...containing some of the pictures I took when I was there... more to come thought!  Baity signing off........  P.S. I would just like to say Lyndz su...........no wait rules lol!
