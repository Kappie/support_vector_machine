I say live for the moment. Get crazy. Fornicate in the streets and dance like everyone's watching. Love like you've been hurt all the time and don't give a shit anymore. Anything to escape a mundane day to day existence. If you're doing something that's embarassing and your feeling nuts, then you're going to be smiling about it later.   Ok, that's enough bollocks for one post..  I was sent this ages ago and just found it again...  urlLink Pooh Bear goes ape shit!
