It is run my Mark Overly who started Kaladi Coffee in  urlLink Anchorage, Alaska  and now runs Kaladi Coffee in  urlLink Denver, Colorado .  Absolutely the best coffee I have tasted (in America) ever.  And I have tatsed a lot.   urlLink CoffeeGeek  also has a lot of information.  Reviews on machines, both commercial and retail.  Try the  urlLink Tamper Shootout  because who doesn't need a good tamp?
