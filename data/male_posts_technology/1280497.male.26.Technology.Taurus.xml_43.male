But then, Elliott Smith came to my rescue. Not the actual guy, for reasons already blogged about, but the music of the man, on my jukebox. I am now officially using a retro MP3 player, if you can imagine such a thing. It's called a  urlLink Personal Jukebox , and I bought it about 2 1/2 years ago from a good friend of mine, Aaron.   It was super cool then, with a nice battery that lasted a long time, a whole ripping/storing/buttkicking system thing you could install on your computer and connect to your PJB (that's P J B, mind you, as in "not Peanut Butter and Jelly") to get the music from the CD to your MP3 bonanza, and most importantly and coolly, a 4.8 gigabyte hard drive that was, if you'll remember the first MP3 players, about a bazillion times larger in terms of capacity than all those rinky-dink Rio players.  Anyway, I now get laughs and snickers when I bust it out at work, like I'm toting around an eight track player, but I'm telling you, the thing works! And I've got to level with you, I don't live in NYC, where it's  de rigeur  to be on the ol' subway and have some amount of time when it would be really nice to have a playing device that's smaller than a deck of cards. Here in Provo, I'm alright with the bigger, less aesthetic style. Granted, when I do put it into my pocket it looks like I'm carrying a shoebox with a cord coming out of it, but I'm alright. The music still plays.   Well, I should mention that it plays but it doesn't write to the hard drive anymore, which means I'm stuck with the same stuff I've had on there for a year now. Luckily, it's got Elliott Smith.  And now we've come full circle, haven't we? I put on the headphones so that I didn't have to contend with the prospect of waking poor Julie up (she's "Poor Julie" tonight because she was sick all day and didn't have the energy to do homework when nightfall came), and started out with the intention of shuffling through a set on the jukebox I called "Acousticky Softy Stuff", which starts with Elliott's "Roman Candle", but has a number of different artists on it, including Bob Dylan, James Taylor, Nick Drake, Dwight Yoakum (thanks, James), John Mayer, Badly Drawn Boy, and others (enough namedropping for you for one day? Me too. But I'm sincere.)   "Roman Candle" is Elliott's first album, recorded on a four track in some person's basement in 1993. Holy Cow! He recorded  THAT  in 1993?! Anyway, so I listened to the first song, and I quickly realized I wanted to hear not the other artists, but the next song from the album, and the next, and the next. So I pulled the jukebox out of shuffle mode (that makes it sound as though there's some sort of lever system to change the settings. Please do imagine that there are such systems, because that makes it all the more retro-cool, which is what I'm going for now with this machine), and I've been inside Elliott's world for almost two hours now. The track playing in my ears right now is "Cupid's Trick" from "Either/Or", his third LP.   I feel strangely vulnerable right now, though, looking at the computer screen and listening to the music. An intruder could easily sneak up on me and bludgeon me. Let's pretend, for a moment, that he is able to recognize the iron-grate steps up the back end of the house to our attic apartment as something other than a fire escape, and that he can get around the deadbolt safely engaged on the front door. But once he (or she! I'm not assuming that every intruder is a man.) gets in, I'm as open to attack as a Wal Mart SuperCenter is open to, uh, the discriminating shopper?    Anyway, I thought I heard (and maybe even saw! I was open to all possible sensory input at the moment. Smell? Taste?) a person in the room. It scared the bejabbers out of me, though. The new glasses I have didn't help me much, I reckon, since every slight twitch of the head brings with it a kaleidoscope of light reflection. Everything's moving in Glassesworld.  Ok, you're wondering when this is going to end. Um, pretty soon.  But Elliott Smith helped me into a serious, serious groove, and before I knew it, I was done creating an outline and writing the introduction. What, no ten pages, you ask? Well, I heard from a reliable source that the T.A. only expected that much from us, and that my professor should have announced it. That's good enough for me, and although I had motivation and perhaps even gumption enough to write the ten pages if I hadn't received a call from the aforementioned reliable source, once I got the call, it was a foregone conclusion that I wasn't going to get close to the ten pages.   Guess what? Ten pages, double-spaced, is just nothing. Nothing at all. I bet I'm going on ten pages in this post alone! Okay, but you get what I mean. It's not that many words. Of course, if my professor is reading this, she's probably rubbing two red pens together to get them warmed up for the correction-fest that will commence upon my turning in the paper when it's due sometime in December.  Night is a digression from the day, and I think the same relationship is paralleled by my writing in the day and my writing in the night. I love the feeling of my hands just making words come onto the screen, and the brain not wasting any time worrying whether something is making sense or is the right thing to say for the given moment. When the time for preparation has passed, as it basically had for the outline and introduction to get written, it's a real blessing to be able to just open that box and watch the goblins fly out.  I've failed to mention that the film I'm doing the paper on is extremely interesting. It's called "Day of the Full Moon" (in Russian: Den' Polnoluniya), and it's worth seeing. Even if you can't find a film with subtitles, you would probably still like it.  It's sleepytime now.
