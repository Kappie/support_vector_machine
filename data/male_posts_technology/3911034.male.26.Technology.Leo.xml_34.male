The pleasantness was dashed when two girls walked in 5 minutes into the film and decided to whisper throughout the whole film, urrrghh! After the film finished they left and one declared "That is the worst film i have ever seen!". Nice to know they were watching whilst whispering. Well i enjoyed it, nice english film about illegal immigrants working shit jobs and looking out for each other whilst getting involved in the underground human kidney trade. Audrey was treated a bit rough in it though. :( Story: 4/5    Production: 3/5   Film:7/10
