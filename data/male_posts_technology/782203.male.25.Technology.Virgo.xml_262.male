I told them it was probably crowbars and drillers, u know so that they could force the driver cabin open and take over the train controls if the train driver goes berserk and tries to derail the train. But my colleague said it probably contains guns and weapons in case of a hijack on the train...heh some people are so silly aren't they ...guns ....!  Ok just wanna state for the record that Charlene is probably the only gal who really understands me, babe if i was a gal I would have your baby; but I guess you have to settle for robbing me of my virginity when u get back to Singapore.
