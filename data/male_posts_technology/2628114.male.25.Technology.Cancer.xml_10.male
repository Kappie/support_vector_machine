I felt phenomenally better than I did Monday, I temperature was perfect for the amount of clothes I wore, and there are no little old ladies lying in the street somewhere because of me.  I ran a 40 today with two 1-minute pickups in the middle.  The course was deceptively hilly which left me breathless a couple times, but it is such a change from the hilly treachery of Eden Park.  I even saw deer today on my run.  My body felt great throughout the run and the only thing I would note is a little tenderness, which I still feel know, in my shins.  I will do my best to rest everything today in preparation for my shorter, but much faster, 20 tomorrow.
