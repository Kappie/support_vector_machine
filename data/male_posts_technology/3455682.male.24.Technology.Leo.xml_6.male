This will have attained its word only when it reaches most of the masses, people out there who are yet to see the light of the day, who may believe a computer to be a god becuse it does most of the things. Its not a surprise to find such a kind of tribe existing out there because still they are living in darkness either deprived or are unable to access what we all get to. This is a first step towards a revolution. I am a part of it. Let us get into the jungle and start our journey rather than sitting on a mountain and look at the jungle from behind. Roar like a lion, jump like a monkey, creep like a snake, hop like a kangaroo, fly like an eagle, swim like a dolphin, walk like an elephant, hide like a chamaleon, fight like an hound, sleep like a bear, ....   Welcome to the Online Jungle.   Thanks Google for providing us, citizens of the world with all the necessary basic supply. I'm coming!  A. T. Raghu Nandan
