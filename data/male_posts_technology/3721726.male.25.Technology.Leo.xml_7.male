Myostatin is responsible for limiting muscle growth.  The only previous cases were where researches at Johns Hopkins had initiated the same behavior in mice, nicknaming them "Mighty Mice."  The kid's 4 now, but can hold up two six and a half pound weights (one in each hand) with his arms extended parallel to the ground.  Neato skeeto!  Can you imagine what stuff like this would do to the professional sports world if it could be replicated via drugs or treatments?  Stolen from  urlLink Slashdot   Another  urlLink link , this one from  urlLink Scientific America , on gene doping.
