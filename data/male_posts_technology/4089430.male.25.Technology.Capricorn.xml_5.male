It's a little lopsided maybe, but we set our own goals and we've agreed to them. "Taking over the world" in this case implies developing an operating system that will replace Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc. That's right. Welcome to the next, next level. I have created a blog with the my new OS as the SRD ( urlLink acronym developed by mymo ). You may  urlLink follow the thought process  that goes into the development of such an OS if you dare.
