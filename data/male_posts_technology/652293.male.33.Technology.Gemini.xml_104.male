And that doesn't include the confirmation screens and error messages.  But there won't be any errors...:)  Gah.  Got to love meta-data.  Wow.  I have nothing to do.  I have a new project, but the first meeting isn't until Thursday.  I need another 2-3 projects!  Think I'll spend the rest of the day editing my articles for issue 5 of the  urlLink mag .  So, feel free to buy me a  urlLink Boont , or better yet, one of  urlLink these .  Woohoo!
