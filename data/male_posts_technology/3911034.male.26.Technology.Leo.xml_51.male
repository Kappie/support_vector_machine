The overall appearance of the film was pretty spectacular. The effects were very top notch especially the external scenes on the various planet surfaces with there different atmospheres. The space ships were done very realistically with heat distorting the surroundings. Vin Diesel was his normal robot self. The story was a bit slow at first but then started rolling along nicely but sort of stopped suddenly and left issues unresolved. I could of done with another half hour to be fully satisfied. More disappointing was the similarities to other films like Dune, The Mummy, Pitch Black and The Matrix. Story: 2/5   Production: 4/5   Film: 6/10
