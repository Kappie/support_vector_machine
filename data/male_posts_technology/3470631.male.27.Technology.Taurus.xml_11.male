More dials= More Reps. Reppy Manual!  That said, my target list has consisted of my age or younger - well that rule is no longer. I'm now cold-calling into the 30-something club. Successful, single, biologically HITTING on all cylinders. It's a can't lose strategy. Got a couple leads in the hopper - will let you all know how it turns out. When I say a couple, I really mean one. alsdk;fj   Just remember this - in sales, all prospects lie. Whether they do it on purpose or not, don't believe a word they say. A sale is made on every call! Either you sell her why she should be with you, or she sells you on why you make her sick. If she asks you for a brochure -- it's a put-off! She'll throw it away! I'm confusing myself now with this metaphor-- but if all else fails: get them drunk?   Tight is right - there is no doubt. Tighter gets harder above 25- also no doubt. The sales cycle is considerably shorter though when you're over 30. SO I"M TOLD. HEY! Not that I know what I'm talking about-- but give me 2 weeks --that's all I'm asking.   Look at the smile on my face! EAR TO EAR BABY!   Single women everywhere just faxed over their congratulations - it said welcome to the club! We're players now boys...SALUT!
