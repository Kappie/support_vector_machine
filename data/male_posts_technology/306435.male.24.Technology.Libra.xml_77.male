Things have been slow around here while everyone is gone.  I had a baseball meeting on Saturday that was very disappointing.  The fact that there was a meeting was great. My manager General (yep that is his first name) was very enthusiastic.  He seemed very excited.  I just wish someone other than myself had shown up.  I feel like I helped make so many deciddions that i should get an assistant coach title.  I feel I know more about the game than him, just fom the talk, but we will see.  It may be I am just confident in what I know from being around the game for so long.  Anyway, no one else showed up for themeeting so hopefully we can get a team together to spend the $1000 that was donated by sponsors (who don't even want to have the team named after them can you believe it?).  Sunday I had dinner with Kristin Wiley (check the cast of characters), here sister Jill, and Jill's HS friend. It was fun. It was nice to see people.  Kristin is always great because we have the exact same since of humor...(Hi, I am Dr. Scholl I will be your Dentist today...that was for you Kristin).  Monday I chilled by myself and Tuesday I hung out with Tom.  we went to the minor league wrestling sho here in Cincinnati.  It was fun.  Then we came back to the apartment and had pizza.  Justin came home two days early and pretty much threw his stuff around ta aprtment which stunk to high heaven.  Sometimes I think he cannot smell himself.  Anyway he was not really in a good mood.    I plan to hang out Kristin again tomorrow.  We are going to eat dinner and watcha movie(s).  Sloppy Trish has also been invited over.  I hope she comes.  I hope Ann gets home soon (wink wink - I know she is reading this, but I am not doing this for bonus points, I swear).  I miss her greatly and cannot wait for her to get back.  I am glad she is having a good time in all her world traveling....  so I will try to keep updated...hopefully a schedule will come soon for baseball...
