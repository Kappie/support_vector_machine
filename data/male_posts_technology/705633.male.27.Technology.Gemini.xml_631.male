Capoeira with Custard and Baity is a great laugh, plus it's having the desired affect and i'm getting slimmer and more flexible.* If you're in the dark about Capoeira, it's a Brazilian/African martial art that a cross between fighting and dancing. To watch it, there's a group of people in a circle singing and clapping, which two people are in the middle fighting. It looks a lot like break dancing, you're upside down a lot and it's more of a game than a full-on fight. I played with our Mestre, Corrine, last night.. damn she's fast. Kicks coming from strange angles and lots of flips and stuff to confuse and impress onlookers.  I almost had to get my Neo on and open up a can of whup-ass, but i'll need a couple more lessons first.  I also resolved to try one of those detox kits from Boots, which I bought in December. You knock back a pill and a vial of "pleasant tasting liquid" with water, which is supposed to help rid your body of nasty toxins. I got a 5 day kit, and by good does it suck. I started it Monday and by the evening i've had a monster headache which just hasn't gone away. You're not supposed to have alcohol or caffeine, which I remember halfway through a 'special' coffee this evening, so I've thrown in the towel and returned to my lovely toxin-fuelled self. The orange goop you put in the water, is.. fucking gross. The taste can best be described as a two-year-old orange that's been marinated in bleach for a fortnight. I have decided that maybe I need caffeine to survive, without that it's like putting water in your fuel tank and trying to rag the tits of it. So the detox kit is in the bin and a cool can of Carling has emerged from the fridge.  Phew.   * Which reminds me of a classic Tommy Cooper line. Guy goes to a gym and says he wants to be able to do the splits. The instructor says.. "Hmm. How flexible are you? The guy says.. "I can't make Tuesdays."
