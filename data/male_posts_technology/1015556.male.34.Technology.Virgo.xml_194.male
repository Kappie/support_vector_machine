He was seriously the real deal.   urlLink This  talks about their short term mission trips.  I like: - each trip is designed to work and serve along a Wheaton missionary, at their invitation. (So on the adult side, you've got to have a pretty large base to start with) - both general and specialty trips. - applications and interviews required, and required preparation sessions. Good stuff.
