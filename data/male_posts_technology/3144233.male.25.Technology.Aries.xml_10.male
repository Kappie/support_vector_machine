Day one went very well especially considering having to wake and pack in the freezing dark, we covered a good twenty miles. The main difficulty was the rocky terrain which covered that 5KM under Ennerdale lake. It was more irritating than difficult but slowed us down a little.  Good luck at the end of the day though when we managed to find a barn with a working stove and an experienced hiker to give us some advice about our route for day 2 (thanks Robin). We were all the more grateful for this when we heard the winds howling outside during the night but we knew there would be more in store for day 2...  Speak soon - Ed, Jim, Joel, Leo and Ben.
