I wasn't happy about Englands football game.  I know no one is a big footie fan, but if you saw the game you will understand!  We were beating France, the competition favourites, and they scored two goals in less than a minute to win it!  bastards :(  Still, Im thinking of organising a get together somewhere, somehow.  So after nine gruelling hours of sainbury's, 3 on trolleys in this blooming heat I'm rather sweaty so I am now off to take a bath!!! see you all soon :)  Andy
