I get a IM from my cousin saying that his wife stepped in dog pee this morning. So? I know its my responcablity to clean it up and I grateful accept that. Its one of the things you have to do with a dog. I love my dog dearly too. But it doesn't mean that its some thing that has to be brought up at work.   I am seriously thinking about applying for the job down in Huntington again. I love my cousin and really do like his wife(even with the strange passive aggressiveness she has) I really need to live with some one else. There is too many expectations with very little communication about what people think they are in that place. Plus I would love to live by my self or with some friends again since I can not seem to separate my life style from theirs. Oh well I think I just need to work a little harder at it.
