In the morning, it was raining moderately. The road was wet and when i am reaching the office, the rain had stopped. I saw the green man from far and thought i could rush for it so i ran moderately to the junction. Not expecting any accident to take place, i sprain my ankle badly before causing my entire body to spring ahead like superman, exposing half of my body on the road. Due to the abrasion resulted from the superman activity, i made a couple of holes on my pants, wet half of my body and hurt my kneel cap. To make things worse, my laptop crashed onto me. The entire weight (mine+laptop) cause a big swell on my ankle and other parts of my body like my waist and shoulders.  I had to make an emergency call to the office to inform them of the accident, went home and change before i go to my chinese sinseh and had my painful session.    The session lasted half an hour or so and it allow me to walk slightly better and easier. Previously, i was virtually limping my way into the cab, asked my mother to come down and help me with my laptop.    My colleagues were great, they were understanding enough to help me whenever possible so that it would make my movement in the office easier. You know, even smallest things like such are not easily available in the office. I knew it coz' i had tasted very mean behaviours in my experience of work. I learnt that we shouldn't take many things for granted and a lot of things in the society are not "expected to be".    In the evening, Mandy told me her bf called from Australia and i got her meanings.. It was an emotional drawback for me, but i really appreciate that honesty. This message knocks me into sense that i can do countless of things, even the sweetest behaviour, will not be able to vie against one phone call from Australia. It even occurs to me that, even if she does have a slight change of mind towards me, i might lose her if he decides to buy her a bouquet of flowers, apologise for totally ignoring her for the past 1 year/s and wanted her to go back.  Ya, i know.. thats pathetic.. You havn't see this... the only thing she could ever say to me is, "I'm sorry. I really wish i could reciprocate..." Thats the current statistic of the situation... "SORRY". Thats the word i often hear and thats the only thing she would say when it comes to opening up of our hearts.  You bet it.. i'm totally, truthfully and sincerely heartbroken with a large amount of undescripable disillusions..    We are so much alike in thinkings.. She is very persistent and hopelessly clinging onto a relationship, where her bf takes her as a holiday gf, the kind that he wants, he comes.. he don't want, he disappear.  Like me, despite so many sorries and so many pathetic situations, i persisted and hopelessly trying to create hopes in the process. Having to write so much, i bet you already guessed my decision.. I will and shall persists even if at the end of the day, it really happened that her bf comes along with a bouquet of flowers, asking for her hand.. I shall blame nobody, and will face all consequences of my own heartache. This blog shall serves as a reminder of my clause and decision. I had already lost 1 girl who got married.. whats another? *LOL*    No, i'm not a loser because losers give up after they realise they can't have it. I don't give up and fight until my last breath.
