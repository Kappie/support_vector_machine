The first result is  this  site.  i.e.   urlLink ..::Supersam Blogs::.. !! ... ummm... did you really expect anything less?! ;-)  Then, if you  urlLink Google  on  urlLink Supersam , this site comes up as the second search result!! ...  Great!!... *LOL*   Tried  urlLink Googlism ?! ... Well, it apparently tells you what  urlLink Google  thinks about you. To check it out, go to  urlLink www.googlism.com  and type in your name  (or your friend's name, or even names of your mom, dad, sister, brother or the name of your dog if you like!)  and hit the  Googlism!  button and have a few laughs!
