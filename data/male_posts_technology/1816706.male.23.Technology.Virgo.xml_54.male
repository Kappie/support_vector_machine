They stayed with me the entire time and I took som vacation time off work to hang out with them.  Actually got to do a lot of great stuff.  Hiked a lot, Maunawili Falls, and Stairway to Heaven, and Diamond Head.  I didn't finish Stairway cause the heights were a bit much, but Jamie and Heather did and I was mad impressed with that.  Kayaked to the Mokes (some islands off the Windward Side).  Had a guided tour at the Dole Plantation (this was the low point), went parasailing, went to a Luau, went snorkeling, surfing, and hanging at the beach, ate some good food, and had some good drink.  A really great time.  It was great to see some people from Texas and have some fun, and while everyone is thinking 3 girls for 2 weeks would be a mess, we actually had a lot of fun.  Do you like boats?
