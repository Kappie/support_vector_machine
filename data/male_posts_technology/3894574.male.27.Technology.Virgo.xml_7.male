My wife takes such good care of me. She picked up a couple kinds of snacks today while grocery shopping and I probably ate half a bag of this cheddar cheese snack mix while I played ESPN 2K5 this evening. That was fun. We had a little bit of a tiff but then we talked about it for an hour or so along with a bunch of other stuff. My Son pooped twice since I got home. The second time, he and I went through our little pre-bedtime ritual. I change his diaper, then he asks for "Pink Yotion". We do his back, front, arms, legs, and feet. Yes I tickle those feet every time and he loves it. Finally we put his Jammies on and he runs off to play. Now (obviously) I'm blogging, and Mommy went to bed. Hopefully tomorrow will be a relaxing day. Sunday we're going to Red Lobster again, this time with other family members to celebrate our anniversary. Maybe someone will try that  urlLink Lobster Mac  Cheese.
