I have 20 plus years of sins to eradicate and sometimes I think I am kidding myself. It's been only three weeks since I started seeing a trainer (oh if only I could be saying that same sentence and ending it with the word "socially") so I realize any changes that may possibly be occuring are hidden under inches of blubber. I say this not to continue to beat myself up but because tonight I had a minor victory. Mind you, the operative word is minor, but I still consider the following a victoy.  Over the past three weeks Jose has attempted to get me to do crunches. Not the garden variety mind you, I am able to do those; but rather a special type of crunch I have never heard of, nor has anyone I have inquired has quite understood as well. While lying on the mat, he hasme raise my legs vertically. As I take the formof a human equivelant of a right angle I am to do crunches. In the past I can barely get my legs up; I think mostly because he has me do these crunches at the end of the workout, when all my energy has been depleted. I don't like failing, particularly in front of someone elseand more than thatI don't ever want to let Jose down. I grant you that last part makes no sense, what difference should it make if I let Jose down, he is being paid to move my carcass. But as much as he has my respect, I so desperately need and cravehis respect and support; I am reduced to a puppy dog to his Alpha Male. So tonight after the standard crunches he told me to raise my legs. I closed my eyes andraised my legs, hoping I still had the strength to fulfill his request.To my surprise when I opened them they were, more or less, in the proper form. I was only able to do 10, all the while grunting and panting; but dammit, I did them.
