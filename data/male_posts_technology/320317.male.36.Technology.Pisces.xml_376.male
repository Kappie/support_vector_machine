By design, I mean much more than interior decoration: I mean developing architectural blueprints that account for everything from navigation to transactions, from workflow to customer communication processes."

 It's all about design before you build. This is obvious with construction of a building, but not with applications. I think it's common sense, but many traditional developers believe we can always figure out the "User Interface" later.
