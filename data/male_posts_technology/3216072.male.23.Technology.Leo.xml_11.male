It took me, as it always does, an hour to make the 15 mile hike down the highway to my office. I grabbed my parking place in the back of the lot, and walked the normal five minutes to the nine story building. All the while giving a polite nod to fellow co-workers that I have never met and really don't care too.  "Damn" I said under my breath when I realized I had forgotten my security badge in the car as I got to the elevator. I guess one of the guys that works on my floor realized why I had said this, and said "Don't you hate it when that happens?". "Yea man I'll see ya up there in ten." I replied as I started the trek back out to the car. Man, I have to do this at least twice if not three times a month. So I lit a cigarette when I got out of the building, nodded to a lady running into the building trying to get to her desk on time. That was something I stopped trying to do years ago.  As I walked back into the lobby of the building I noticed there was a commotion going on over by the elevators. When I got there I asked what was going on. Apparently one of the elevators cable broke and fell a couple floors before the brakes stopped it. No one was hurt but they were all a little shook up. I couldn't help but to think that I was lucky to not be on that elevator, because it was the one I was going to get on.  The work day was pretty much routine after that and at lunch I decided I would go out instead of eating my lunch that I had brought from home. Walking to the elevator I was stopped by my boos who just wanted to make small talk. Which intern made me miss the elevator, the one that didn't break. So I pushed the little down button and waited for it to come back. Luckily I was able to get on by myself. I hate that awkward silence between two passengers on an elevator.  A feeling came over that I didn't like at the eighth floor, and that is when it happened. All the power was lost and the elevator stopped between the the seventh and eighth floor. "Great just my luck!" I said to no one. So I sat there waiting for the emergency lights to come on, but after a couple of minutes I decided that I would have no such luck. Reaching for my lighter I could only hear the creaking of the elevator in a hollow shaft. Then snap and I heard a loud noise and what sounded to be the other elevator falling. Aloud crash shook the whole building, and the elevator I was in shook even more violently. What is going on I thought to myself in disbelief reaching for the hand rail to brace my self.   With my lighter in hand I looked for the emergency phone. Picking it up I heard the dial tone and then the phone started ringing. It must have rang thirty times with no answer, so hoping that maybe someone had noticed that this elevator had gotten stuck I yelled out. I kept yelling not so much frantic, but more like annoyed. After 5 minutes I decided I would stop with the yelling and just waited it out. Someone was bound to check this damned moving room I was trapped in.   "Christ, its been an hour and still nothing." I was thinking out loud. I went back to my lighter and decided I needed a cigarette. I mean you keep me locked up in here for this long making me miss my lunch with no word. It was the least that I deserved. I figured they must have shut this one down and forgot to look to see if anyone was in here in all the confusion that the other one falling must have brought on. Yet still time crept by.  A pack of gum and 6 cigarettes later, I decided that this was getting ridiculous. So I grabbed the lighter and went looking for that latch you always see them use in the movies. Click! "Ahh, there it is" I said out loud my voice a little horse from not really using it for the past couple of hours. As I claimed up to the top of the car I could see the top half of the eighth floor door. As I got up to it I decided to knock on it, hoping to get someone's attention. No luck! Man what in the world is going on I had to wonder.  After trying to pry the doors open and failing miserably. I remembered that sometimes they had a latch or some type of mechanism to open these doors from the shaft. I finally found what I was looking for just as I was about to give up. It was towards the top and looked like just a little wire, but it got the job done and I stepped out onto the eighth floor. Man what a horrible experience I was thinking to my self as I started looking around for someone. Knowing I couldn't get access to the main part of the eighth floor only the bathrooms I decided to take the stairs back up to nine.  As I walked onto the floor and into the main room I noticed something odd about it all. There was no one there! "What the fuck?" I heard myself say as I walked around looking for any sign of life. Guess this is the reason no one found me. They must have evacuated due to one of the elevators falling, I started to think. So I figured it best that I do the same. As I started down the stairwell I noticed I didn't see and of the doors that led out to the offices on any of the floors. They were just not there! So I darted back up to nine and it was gone as well. "No way!" I said loud enough for it to echo down the stair well. I couldn't help but think did someone slip me something or am I loosing my mind.  At the bottom of the stairs on the lobby floor the door was there. Just the thought of that seemed so perplexing and silly. When I looked back to make sure I wasn't just imagining it all, the stairs were gone! "Ok I really am loosing it!" I said looking at an empty shaft that runs all the way to the top of the building. Now I was in a panic! I ran out into the lobby through the main doors and into what I can only describe and the most beautiful forest I had ever laid eyes one. I could barely breath for the air being so clean and sweet. Slowly the thoughts of what I had just experienced drifted from my mind as if it had never happened.  I looked back to see the building and only saw trees with the clearest stream that anyone had ever laid eyes on winding through them. Suddenly I didn't know why I was looking for a building or what one was for that matter. What was happening I would never know. For all thoughts off that past, that I now hadn't lived, left me. I was in a new world that was known to me only as home. It was an ancient place before civilization. I was one of the greatest hunters my tribe had ever produced. And I was on a trip with my weapon in hand, determined to kill.
