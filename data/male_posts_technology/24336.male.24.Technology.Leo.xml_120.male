     

      In the midst of a vast wilderness, far off, standing all alone, is a high mountain. You are sitting on open ground on top of the mountain, looking off into the distance in all directions. There are no boundaries. As you sit, you fill the world.  Relaxing and releasing body and mind, You abide in the Buddha-realm.
