At least I have a constant means of email though. Kinda like getting junk mail in the actual postal mail. It makes you feel almost alive, or at least that some junk mail list cares that you still exist.   Anyhowie... yes good old slow weekends. I got to work yesterday, then I just kinda vegged the rest of the weekend. I did change some of my room around, and hook up the neighbor-piss-off-anator (aka the home theater subwoofer, at least I turned it way down).   I need to win a million dollars. Or 100,000. That'd be nice too.
