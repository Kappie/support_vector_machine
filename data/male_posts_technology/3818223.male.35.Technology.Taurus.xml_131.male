Which leads me to:  Review -  urlLink The Wild World of Batwoman  The is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen for every reason.  Even the MST3K guys couldn't do much with it.  Fortunately, it also contained an old educational short about the effects of cheating.  - 0 out of 5 stars for the movie; 1.5 out of 5 stars if you count the Cheating short and the MST3K bots.
