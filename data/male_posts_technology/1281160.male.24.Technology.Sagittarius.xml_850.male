It is your place.   1) How many posts should appear in the home page? 2) In the existing format, what do you feel is missing?  3) What more can be added to the blog? 4) Do you think that any part of the blog is not al used by you / it just takes up space? 5) In the existing design, what parts do you actually find useful? 6) Any more of your suggestions are welcome in case I missed out anything  Please take time to think about it and reply.
