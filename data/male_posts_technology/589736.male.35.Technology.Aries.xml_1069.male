I think you are the only here that meets those requirements.  Given that 1) I am a corporate slave using MS products or products that only seem to run on PCs (AutoCAD and it's associated engineering software) and 2) That an easier to use download system is not incentive enough for me to change my home systems, I guess I will make do with my rickety old PCs.  Oh, if only Apple had not been so stubborn about closed architecture 20 years ago.  Bill Gates would not be obscenely rich and computers would be more stable.
