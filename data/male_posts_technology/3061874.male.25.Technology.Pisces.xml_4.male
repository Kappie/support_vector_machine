"Think about how the Web has changed your life in the last 10 years. Now, try to extrapolate 10 years forward and you should feel dizzy. We're still in day one of developing and innovating in search. There's still a lot of exciting discoveries to be made," Manber said in a keynote address at this year's World Wide Web (W3C) conference here.  "It's not about speed or size anymore. It's all about quality. It's about delivering the tools that allow relevancy. It's good to make searching faster and faster because that part is well understood. The quality part is not understood and that's the challenge we face today," he added.    Another  urlLink article  on internetnews.com mentions about projects at microsoft.   With the cost of data storage dropping to levels in which a terabyte of space will cost no more than $1,000, Rashid said the time will come when deleting data will be a thing of the past.  "There won't be reason for anyone to throw away any data," Rashid said. "We'll get to the stage where, for $1,000, you will be able to store more than a trillion bytes...More than enough space to store every conversation you have ever had, from the time you are born to the time you die."   With world becoming distributed and data lying not just on PC or web but mobile phones, future networked devices (networked iPod,..) and no delete button - the search wouldn't just imply searching web resources, but searching personal data quick, from any device and with quality results.
