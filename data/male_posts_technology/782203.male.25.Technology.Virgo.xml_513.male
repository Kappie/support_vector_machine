Well the course sounds like it would be less strenerous than the one I was supposed to go - that one went by a codename that sounded like it was going to be a pretty painful affair. Hopefully this new course is mainly classroom stuff. But then again who knows maybe 'military intelligence' could include stuff like sniffing the grass on the battlefield to estimate how long it's been since the enemy left? That would be a pretty cool skill to have too. But yeah I guess I will probably find out what's it all about when I go for it.
