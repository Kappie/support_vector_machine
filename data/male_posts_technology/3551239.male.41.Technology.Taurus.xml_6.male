I feel terrible that she is having to endure this with me, but she has reassured me several times that she would much rather be with me in this awful place, than me being here by myself. All of this mess because of that crazy woman who has now taken a notionto killing anyone who says the wrong thing to her.Where will she draw the line?  I found out today fromFBOCA that one of the young ladies who worked with Ideltech was found by her husband. I can't imagine what she must've done to gather the wicked witch's attention, but apparently she did. Who else could've done something like they described? I try not to think about what she has in store for me, but I suppose that I can bear this room a little longer knowing that shewill not get to have her way with me. I shudder to think of my dear Virginia having to find...ahh, no, I won't even utter it here.  Getting down to business, I'm still working on getting back to those who expect things of me and I do hope that they haven't lost faith in me. I have an idea that may get me back to our boards within 24 hours. That is, if these oafs will go along with it. I think I can convince them, but if not, I may still find a way around them. Idohope they are continuing without me for the moment. They know where the site is and they have good ideas as to how to continue our work. There is one thing I want to let them know (I hope they are reading this)...When I got here, on the door was that same creepy picture we had been discussing, and just above it was that name. I have to believe those are the two pieces of information that we need. Can we take it another step farther?
