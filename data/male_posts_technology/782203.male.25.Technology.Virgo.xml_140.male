After that went to his grandma's house where we had some pretty delicious mee hoon curry dish, satay which I and sam barbecued, some kind of pork bun which i think is an acquired taste, prawn salad and fish soup. Came back to watch the Pool-Boro match which was boring as hell (Liverpool are like the most boring team ever) and then brought my dog for a walk cos he needed to relieve himself, sigh should have toilet trained him when he was younger.  I got some weird reactions from some of my friends after they read my previous entry. Frankly I am really afraid of whether there is anything seriously wrong with me (i mean there must be something wrong otherwise they wouldn't ask me to come back) and whether this will cause me to lose the job. But the reactions of some of my friends ..anyway I will know everything by Monday.
