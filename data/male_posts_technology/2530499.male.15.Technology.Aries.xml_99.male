It won't turn into a shameless webcompany. NO SHAMELESS PLUGS! Anyway...expect Beej to have a new and  improved  PTH. Which, is aptly URL'd pth2.blogspot.com and is much cooler than PTH. Because no one ever wanted a site from PTH.  Oh, and another thing...During MY hiatus, JQ and ROZ stole my (tm)'d  "Because..." line....which was usually a fucking LINUX reference, so fuck windows....wait... (looks at his SOHO network) Damn windows.  -beej
