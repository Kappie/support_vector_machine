This test only has one question, but it's a very important one. Please don't answer it without giving it some serious thought. By giving an honest answer you will be able to test where you stand morally.   The test features an unlikely, completely fictional situation, where you will have to make a decision one way or the other. Remember that your answer needs to be honest, yet spontaneous.   Please scroll down slowly and consider each line - this is important for the test to work accurately.   You're in Florida...In Miami, to be exact... There is great chaos going on around you, caused by a hurricane and severe floods ....... There are huge masses of water everywhere.... You are a CNN photographer and you are in the middle of this great disaster. The situation is nearly hopeless.   You're trying to shoot very impressive photos.  There are houses and people floating around you, disappearing into the water. Nature is showing all its destructive power and is ripping everything away with it.   Suddenly you see a man in the water, he is fighting for his life, trying not to be taken away by the masses of water and mud. You move closer. Somehow the man looks familiar.   Suddenly you know who it is - it's George W. Bush!  At the same time you notice that the raging waters are about to take him away...forever. You have two options. You can save him or you can take the best photo of your life. So you can save the life of George W. Bush, or you can shoot a Pulitzer prize winning photo. A unique photo displaying the death of one of the world's most powerful men.   And here's the question: (Please give an honest answer)  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Would you select colour film, or go with the simplicity of classic black and white?
