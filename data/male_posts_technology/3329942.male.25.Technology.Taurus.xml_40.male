It was around midnight, that I woke up, donno why ? I even cannot remember whether I was having a  dream or a nightmare , when I woke. So I went to the roof,  lit the 2nd last cig  (There are always few cigs at secret places hidden at home ;-)), and sat resting my back onto the wall.  I rose my head  started oogling a distant star.   Thought machine (TM)   invoked itself.  "What the heck Are you doing ?", "Its middle of the night, don't You have anything to ponder upon",    I said,  "Don't feel like !!"   TM said,  "You have one of the finest collection of books in yr wardrobe, Several of them are unfinished, Why don't you finish anyone of it ?"   I said,  "How much will it matter, If I finish one more, I know what the author must have talked about in the climax"   TM continued,  "You can call sbdy and talk to him or her, at least don't sit idle, its not like you"   I was now furious,  "Will you ever let me sit in peace ?"   TM was not bothered,  "You have gone insane, Think dear !! Think about future, Think about fetching new Job, think about the gal to whom u winked today, think about being the Howard..."   Disgusted I felt and thus interrupted,  "Go to hell, and take all these worries with you only. Lemme sit here and Stare at the empty space and leave me alone"    TM smiled, there was mockery and sarcasm, but no joy.   I ignored him now and sat and sat there....  staring   ...finishing the cig and kindled another and continued staring....   Then there was NO TM, NO THOUGHT, NO WILL, NO DESIRE, NO GF, NO FRIEND, NO PL, NO VP, NO TESTLAB, NO MBA, NO BANGY, NO BOMBAY, NO US, NO EUROPE, NO FRENCH, NO JARGON, NO LINGO, NO GOD, NO LADY LUCK, NO YOU  NO ME.   Now  there is only SPACE and EYES staring at it.
