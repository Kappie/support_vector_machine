I then went to the tag office to get a new license plate for C's new van.  I then went to the post office to mail the tags and my son's music for HS band.  I then went to Abra Auto Body for an estimate to fix my car.  I scheduled repair to start Tuesday, June 29.  I then went down to Coweta Custom Carpentry to look at some sheds for the back yard.  I immediately picked one out but was put on hold due to permits.  Apparently I need a permit to get the shed installed.  Shit!  Then I went to Circuit City to buy a new computer to fix the broken one.  Got a cheap HP Celeron computer.  I think a power thing wacked my computer.  Saturday morning I got up early cause the mulch was getting delivered.  I then started to move some dirt and weeds out of C's garden.  Tough work.  The mulch never showed before I had to leave.  I cleared about 4 square feet Saturday morning.  I then proceeded to wash cars for the HS band fees.  I worked for 4 hours and made a whopping $14 bucks.  Not sure it was worth it now.  Decided I could get a movie at Blockbuster instead of going to the movies.  I rented Timeline and Matrix.  What a waste of human effort.  Sunday, got up, showered, shaved, dressed and off to church only to leave early because of a biggotted homo speech by the assistant to the minister.   Left church, went home and worked on the garden the rest of the day.  I cleared quite a bit of weeds, and the it started to rain and rain and rain.  I thought I could work through it, but thought better of it.  It only lasted about 15 minutes and then I went back to work.  I wanted to get the bare dirt covered before the weeds had a chance to get back growing.  I covered it with about 4-5 inches of mulch.  Mowed the front lawn.  Looks like crap due to the excess of grass.  Then showered, Long Horn T-bone for dinner.  I saw Shrek 2 last night.  I liked the ending.  Funny how donkey has some kids now with dragon.  Went to bed and back to work today.  Got a call from Piedmont painting today to estimate painting the house.  The garage door should be fixed now.  TG!  That's all I got.  Kevin
