I thought for sure the Internet would be full of bloggers talking about the event. Nice Microsoft swag. T-shirt. Tons of CDs - 60-day trials, beta, etc. Oh, and I learned a bit about VS .NET and met a few people. Mobile .NET has to be the big Microsoft thing this year -- all the conference speakers were raving about it.
