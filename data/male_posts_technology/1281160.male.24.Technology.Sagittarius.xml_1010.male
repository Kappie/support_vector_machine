Yeah sure, I have to install a news aggregator in my system for segregating web articles... will contact you soon regarding that, slightly busy nowdays.  I think, u were regularly visiting "my  urlLink Thoughts " page, and got fed up with out any updates and ultimately found out a tool for automatic request for viewing modified webpages...  Cheers
