The previous one worked very well and if all you want is a simple visitor count I can't recommend  urlLink Tagboard's  highly enough.  Our new counter though has a few more features. For starters it keeps a permanent record of the high water mark ie the maximum number of people on a site at once. In addition to that with a bit of cookie magic you can see  who  is online if they setup the their WIP Name. This script is by  urlLink Bloglog  - however the instructions are in Dutch so you will need to run them through Babelfish or something. Or be born in Holland.    via  urlLink Attu Sees All  as this is where I saw it implemented.
