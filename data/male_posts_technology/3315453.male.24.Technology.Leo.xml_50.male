Our  urlLink apartment  that we are in now was very nice to let us out of our lease to get the new apartment.  We had just signed a new lease about a week ago and I did not think that they would let us out of it.  Anyway now we have to pack and move out by the 20th before me and Becca both leave for our trips.  It will be tough, especially since we are going down to  urlLink Vancouver  to help with the house every weekend, but I think we can do it.  The new apartment that we will be moving into is on the first floor, comes with all utilities paid, free satellite (Although I think that might be a distraction), free Ethernet and phone service.  The only problem is that there is no  urlLink washer and dryer  in the apartment, but there is one onsite.  Anyway that is our fun for the next few weeks, and once again we are on our way down to  urlLink Vancouver  after I get off  urlLink work  tomorrow at about 10:00pm.  Wish us luck!  And I hope you like all the links ;)
