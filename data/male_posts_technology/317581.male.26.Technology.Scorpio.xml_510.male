(It happened 1 time, it could happen again) Props to Racheal for finding it:)  My life has been changing and staying the same all together. My Piano lessons are going great. I am proving to be a record breaking student. Everything except my project piece is coming along. The project piece should be done by next week. So that's cool.  I'm still torn by my love for my ex girlfriend and wanting to move on. Maybe this is one of those growing pains they were talking about. Maybe this is throwing yourself at something so you don't have to deal with the emotional side of things? Maybe this is I have extra money now, so I should buy myself something nice that will help make me feel something?  Well, thus ends another uplifting post to the blog... Peace-
