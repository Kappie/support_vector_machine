Of course, anyone who knows me in real life might guess who I am.  For those people, you are wrong, I'm the  other  one.  To anyone else... I am an unemployed ex-student (with a degree in Computing) living in the frozen north of England.  My exciting hobbies include computer games, films, roleplaying, summoning the effort to look for a job and dreading an eye operation later in the year.  Hopefully my hobbies have now been expanded to include "writing a blog".  Damn, this all sounds depressing.  Enjoy life!  Its great!
