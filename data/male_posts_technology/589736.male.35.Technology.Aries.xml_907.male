     
      Another question, and I'm only trying to understand:  So we're essentially at a party (the world) where not all the people (nations) are dancing (joining our economic vision), so we're turning up the music louder and louder (cramming our economic solution down their throats) until either all people (nations) are dancing (just like us) or they are whimpering in the corner (forgotten [central Africa]) or under our direct command (colonized [Iraq] by our forces)?
