This route tends to be 1+ hour longer, but I think it's worth it to not have to sit in the Beltway parking lot.  
 
 I spent the weekend down in Bedford this weekend.  Sorry Adrian, but it was a family weekend -- I'll be sure to drop in next time I'm down there.  Susan graduated from  urlLink UVA  on Sunday.  Despite the ubiquitous red fences marking construction and renovation, Charlottesville remains as enchanting as ever. 
 
 I really miss college.  I wouldn't say that I missed it last year or even three months ago, but I miss it now.  I think it's because my job has transformed into a glorified e-mail answering / forwarding service.  All I do is try to keep the project moving, addressing problems with kludgey solutions that will get the product out the door.  There is definitely no creativity in my job at this point of the project, so I can't help but think about how things would be different if I went back to school.  I'll entertain those thoughts later, though.
 
 I haven't had a chance to ride my mountain bike since last Wednesday.  I rode Stillwell again.  This time I think it was a draw, which brings my record to 0-2-1.  She didn't throw me over the handlebars, but the climbs got me a couple of times.  One day I will overcome the sheer terror I feel on the downhills and the complete exhaustion I experience going back up.  You have to wonder why I do this.
 
 It's back to Las Vegas for another seven days of company conference fun starting this Thursday.  I'll give them one thing: this thing gets better organized every year, which in turn translates to less 16 hour days for me.  Nonetheless, I am not looking forward to this year's trip.  I do get to celebrate my birthday out there, though.  I will turn the ripe age of 25 (the perfect number -- not in the  urlLink mathematical sense , but still perfect to me) on Tuesday, May 25, 2004.  One quarter of a century.   urlLink E-mail  me for my address in case you want to send me a birthday present (money is always accepted).
