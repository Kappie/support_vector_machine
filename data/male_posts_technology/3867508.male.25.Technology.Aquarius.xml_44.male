Bush  Well Ron Reagan might be a strange source for an article titled as above, but he really makes a stunning case of why georgie shrub should be kicked out on his ass this November.  It really is a great read, I encourage you all to read the entire article.  You know I really can't believe that anyone would want to vote for the shrub again.  Seriously, I don't even know why Republicans would want to vote for this man again.  He really has made disastrous choices in his 4 years at the helm.  His administration has been the most secretive administration I have ever heard of in this fine country's recent history.    He makes a mockery of environmental protection, of environmental treaties.  His administration would rather lie first and ask questions never.  The hope I think is that enough people will swallow the tale that they spin and hope that if the truth comes out, it comes out quietly and enough people DON'T hear about it.  I think Ron Reagan mentions some specific examples of this administrations little lies.  But the big lie is that this administration deserves four more years at the helm of the greatest country in the world.  In November take this country back!
