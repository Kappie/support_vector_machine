Installing Windows XP Pro went smooth, or as smooth as a Windows XP installation can go.  The good news!, I have the rest of the night off to do whatever the hell I feel like, which will probably be nothing, but o well.  I made $60, which should last me the next few dayz, or at least I do that big computer job next monday for someone out in Bearspaw.  On the not so bad side of the day, my next door neighbours got a new puppy (well, they've had him for 3 months now), but he is a cutie, and now my dog has a new playmate too.    urlLink       Well, if I don't post anymore for the rest of the nite, nite all!
