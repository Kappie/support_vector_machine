It seemed that everything was working against me to today as my body felt sluggish, my legs felt like concrete, along with just being tired.  Within the first mile of the run, my body felt like garbage, I swallowed a bug that left me with a hairball hack feeling the rest of the run, and I almost got hit by a car (granted I was jaywalking something fierce but that car was travelling WAY TOO FAST!).  My legs were able to carry my body just over 4 miles in about 40 minutes.  I also seemed to find the dirtiest, smelliest neighborhood in all of Cincinnati.  This didn't help any.  I would compare the cleanliness to that of a street in Hamilton(!) and the smell to that of a garbage dump.  It was whatever neighborhood is directly northeast of Walnut Hills, East Hill or O'Bryonville or something.  I often had to hold my breath through the noxious smells of the street while dodging garbage strewn everywhere.  I was happy to finally come out on Madison Road in O'Bryonville.  I'm not sure why I thought it would be a good idea, but I then decided to go down Torrence and back up Taft.  When I wasn't sucking on car fumes on Torrence, the downhill was okay, but peril loomed as I began up Taft.  The hills up Taft were shear treachery and forced me to stop and walk once and drag myself up the rest of the way after that.  I was happy to get home but even so tired that even stretching in the end was a chore.  Runs like today are not fun but knowing my end goal I can still understand why I do them.  Here's hoping tomorrow is a new, better day!  No final thought for the day, I need to go drink a gallon of Listerine or something to get this insect taste out of my mouth.  Have a better day than I did a run!
