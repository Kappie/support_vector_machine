It seems as though she has paranoia of some kind as indicated by the post-it note on the inside of her front door that says "Gotcha!" She also claims that someone referred to as "they" enter her apartment and "do a number" in the toilet, causing it to back up. In addition to that, her furnace supposedly "spits out particles all over the place" It got so  bad  she went and stayed in a hotel last night. So I went over and turned the water back on to her toilet, that she had shut off, so it would flush. Then I replaced her furnace filter, which didn't need replaced. This was the second time I had looked at the furnace "problem". The first time, she was showing me areas where the "particles" were on the carpet. There was nothing wrong with anything! Nothing on the carpet, No smell, No nothin'! Then she asked me to help her put on her bracelet. I did, and she asked me to help her with her necklace. I did. That was soooo uncomfortable! I immediately went back and told my manager that I was never going in that apartment alone again. So today while I was in that apartment alone again, the lady started pointing out the granules that "they" had left inside the back of her toilet, and as I was trying to leave she said, "There's that stuff that comes out of the windows when I leave" "That's why I wear my coat" "I don't suppose there's anything you can do about that is there?" I said, "I'm not sure" she said, " I didn't think so". Man she weirds me out.
