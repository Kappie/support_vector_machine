I was shopping with the wife and kids at Babys R Us when we overheard the rantings of an extremely large young woman with her equally large husband or brother, standing next to their biggie sized mother on one of those electric carts made for fat people. After my initial wave of disgust, I strolled past them with my 11-month old daughter (she has a twin brother who was with her mother, both equally offended by the enormity of the situation!)and talked quietly about finding the insulated sippie cups we were searching for.   I later felt guilty for having been so judgemental. Here I am, spouting off about what it is to be a Christian and looking down my nose at people. My wife is even more spiritual than I, and she too was guilty. I never said I wasn't human, and neither did God. It was one of those instances where I realized I do have faults, and have a very difficult time getting past them   These people were rednecks and fat. They had been given the opportunity to waste their days away in front of Oprah with a box of Cheezits, Ho-ho's, bologna sandwiches, Chips-Ahoy, Double Stuffed Oreos, and chocolate milk. Because they now have the ability to mobilize people who don't care to walk anymore, fat people have no incentive to get moving. Especially those with little self esteem or desire to do anything but laze around, eat, have children, and live off of welfare.   I was on a mission trip to Wheeling, West Virginia a few years ago and actually heard people talking this way! This is their life! They don't even consider college a remote possibility! Their focus is on having more children to increase their welfare checks. And we as Americans encourage the attitude by providing new ways to be lazy. It is a tragedy for the American way of life, and I believe contributes to imminent downfall of our decadent society. The divide between the classes is growing, and with it goes the understanding.
