It rained a little over the weekend and was overcast enough to make being outside in the day bearable. My body is healed up from the marathon and ready to jump into some other activity, be it biking or swimming, or maybe everything. I wish I read faster, so ten minutes spent with War and Peace was worth more than just ten pages. They are good pages, though, and Tolstoy knows how to make you feel like you're part of the times he lived in when you read his words. Man I wish I was a writer with a book that critics could love and hate.
