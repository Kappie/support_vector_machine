Several times i've come across things that i've been before... "better hold onto this. Might be worth something". Don't kid yourself like I did. Launch it. It's so liberating. I've put two big plastic bags of old clothes into the Sally Army's bin at Rue Des Pres tonight. If you see any poor people running around with a t-shirt saying "SPRING BREAK MEXICO 2003, WHAT GOES ON IN CANCUN STAYS IN CANCUN" then you know where they got it.  In search of cheap equipment for the new gaff, I found myself at a car boot sale on Sunday. It was an interesting experience. I can't remember the last time i've bought something (not including the Daily Star) for under a pound. There was a very scary woman that was directing the traffic around outside. It was rather surreal as she was holding a plate of brownies at the same time. Every now and then she would storm into the hall where people were quietly pondering the purchase of a scalextric set or something, and bellow "GREEN VAUXHALL NOVA. REGISTRATION J55142. IF YOU DON'T MOVE IT NOW IT'S GOING TO GET TTTTTTTTTTOWED AWAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!!!" she was bright signal red when she screamed. I thought her head was going to explode, like in that movie  Scanners .   Make sure you take  urlLink The Geek Test , a measure of your computing, roleplaying, and cult movie status. I scored total geek, which is less that I thought.
