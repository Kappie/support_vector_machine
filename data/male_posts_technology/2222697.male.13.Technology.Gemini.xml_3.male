Its amazing how confusing picking out parts for computers can be.  here's a list of the stuff so far::::: a case with neon lights that has no name, AMD Athlon XP cpu, CORSAR 256mb DDR RAM, K7N2 Delta Motherboard, Radeon 9000 graphics card, Inspire T2900 speakers (good deal), BTC 9001A RF Wireless keyboard and mouse, BTC dual digital storage combo (cd writer, dvd rom, and supports 7 memory cards), And finally 50 cd-r's from sony. The end.
