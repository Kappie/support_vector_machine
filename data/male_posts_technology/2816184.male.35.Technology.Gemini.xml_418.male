I haven't seen those flashing lights in a dog's age, so where the heck is it coming from now? Well, wherever it's from it can just scoot right back there.  Had a very nice weekend.  Valantines day spent with the wife and child.  I went the macho route and bought her underwear.  It actually went over far better than I ever expected.  I even got credit for paying a fortune, when I really didn't!  She didn't buy me anything, but I got my present back in service....  ;-)  Even my dad was out for V's with my step-mom!  Now that's something...getting him out of the house!  Work sucks, but that't to be expected, I think.  I have the best fun playing an In Nomine RPG with my best friend (in the whole wide word), rather than doing work.  Then again, it's not that onerous here.  Okay, that's enough for now...back to work and psuedo-work while waiting to see if my head'll explode....
