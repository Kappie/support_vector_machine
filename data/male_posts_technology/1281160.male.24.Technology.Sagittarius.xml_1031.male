It has got no direct correlation with God or divinity, but only that the meditater could use his new-found bliss for any good things that he may ascertain to take up... and in his views "good things" may encompass spirituality...   The reason why meditation finds links to Godliness is more because the "teachers" of meditation find no other better way to attract people to this amazing art... after all, in the name of God, people are even ready to do things non-sensical to the common sense... this stems from the homegrown "fear" of God... and the attitude of bargain -  get me passed in the exam and I would break 108 coconuts  (as though God asked for it)...  Often, meditation also finds links with religiousness rather than spirituality... and these days the former takes root at the expense of the latter... A reason for the Srirangam tragedy (where 40 people, mostly women and children, were burnt in a marriage hall) was given that  "the temple failed to perform a vital ritual and such a tragedy was always on the cards" ... Rubbish..!! Would the "holy" person dare utter this line if he was a victim's kin...!! He would rather be better off trying to help the victims if he can or else keep his mouth shut...!!!! Another classic example of spirituality lost in splendour is the ISKCON temple in Bangalore... that seems to be growing into a market place rather than a spiritual avenue...  The contemporary "teachers" of meditation are no different... they use this "fear" of God to inculcate this practice... except a few organizations, quite a few are more interested in the business of teaching meditation rather than the service of helping people find peace...
