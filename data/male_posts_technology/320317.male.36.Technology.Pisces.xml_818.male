The Gnome and KDE desktop environments are themeable, and have plenty of themes available. However, like with Firefox, it’s the default theme that matters to me, and to the majority of people using the software." 

 Do they ever. What is ironic to me is the tools a designer would use to help enhance the UI of Linux would no doubt come from a competing platform.
