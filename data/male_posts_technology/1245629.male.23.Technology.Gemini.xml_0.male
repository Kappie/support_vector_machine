It went back to a system worse than what he already had on his desk. Of course, he was just a kid and didn't know better (although if he had paid better attention in class he should have), but producing a system that was fundamentally different from the base he started with seems pretty good proof that it was a redesign....."   Guessed right?   Andrew Tanenbaum on Linus Torvalds.  More at the article on his homepage: http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/brown/
