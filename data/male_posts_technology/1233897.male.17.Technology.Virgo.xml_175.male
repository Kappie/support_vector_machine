I promised Laurie that I'd post something tonight (well, this morning now...) but I also just promised Gwen that I would get to bed very soon, and you know how it is with girls - just can't turn them down (well.... for most things). So, I shall be brief.  Several of my computers are up and running including my main (soon to be sub-main) Windows box, which I am currently on.  I successfully reformatted it and installed the new OS, but dling all the new drivers and patches... well that's still taking some time. I just took then case apart again today to replace the old drab green and yellow LEDS with red and blue Super-brights. Man, what a difference... those things are powerful!  I talked to Laurie on IRC earlier today for the first time in... hmm almost a week.  We agreed that I would call her at 8 my time, 9 her's, tonight but, I FORGOT MY PHONE when I went to church!!! *grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr* to all things regrading my memory (lol).  I'm going to the beach tomorrow, kinda against my wishes... I had thought that the trip was planned for next week, but got canceled because of VBS... oh well.   I called Gwen around 10:30 tonight and got her dad. He told me that she would call me back shortly, so I waited for... well it turned out to be 45 minutes... not untill she called me back, but untill I started thinking and realized that my phone was back in the car again!!! (after I had gotten it out of the house, after I  had forgotten it when I wanted to call Laurie... lol). I went out and checked, and sure enough, she left a voicemail 25 minutes earlier. I called her back and evidently woke up her dad, but she said it didn't matter so whatever. At one point we were talking about the terrible amount of sleep I get and she kept trying to think of ways to get me to go to bed earlier. (lol) She wanted to talk to my mom, so I gave the phone to her and they conspired (I could hear the entire conversation, and contributed to it) to set a bedtime for me and how on earth to enfoce it. My mom suggested tying me to my bed every night for several weeks untill it became habit to get to bed that early, but I thought clorephorm (spelling?) would work better. (LOL) Eventually my mom gave the phone back to me, and Gwen and I continued talking, with my mom randomly grabing the phone from me now and then and interjecting comments like, "Well, we used to tell him when he was younger that 'If he weren't so cute, he'd be in a whole lotta' trouble by now'" (HAHAHAHA) My mom's great. Gwen was laughing about that for a while. 'Ne way, I did tell her I'd get to bed soon, so I should stop talking about us talking about me getting to bed soon, and get to bed soon :)   Sleep well, my beloved ones. Sleep well.
