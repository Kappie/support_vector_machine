Too bad it ends this coming Sun. I'll probably drop in to eat 1 or 2 more sausages before then.  Also saw Lord of the Rings, the Two Towers today. Hmmm... it was alright but I really expected better. I'm not saying it's any worse than the 1st, but I just somehow felt it was a big anti-climax. I expected better war scenes. But it was still a good show.  Also noticed recently I've been buying books. Muz be some influence by my housemates. But it's good. I dun regret the books I bought, they are worthwhile either in content, or price, or both. Either way, I'm glad I'm starting to get back into my leisure reading again.  OK betta get back to work. Heheh, but think I'll sneak a chapter from my new book first.
