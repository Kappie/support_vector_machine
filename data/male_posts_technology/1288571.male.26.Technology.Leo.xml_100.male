Been busy playing some new games I bought:  urlLink Sacred  and  urlLink Battlefield 1942 . I know BF1942 is an older game but I've just really discovered it and finally see what all the noise was about. Sacred is a new game, much like Diablo 2, only better.   Tomorrow is my birthday, making me 26.Age doesn't really bother me but now I'm officially closer to 30 than 20. Scary..
