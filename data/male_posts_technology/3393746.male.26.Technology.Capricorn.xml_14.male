LA Lakers lost...thats made me philosophical, they didnt loose because of they played badly but they were outplayed by a better team...Detroit Pistons...Pistons dont have stars but they have hard working individuals...who work together really well...if Billups was unable to take shots then Hamilton was there, and if they both were lying low then Rasheed came up to take charge...and Ben the effervacent Wallace...he was every where...its a triumph of team, hardwork and leadership over stars and luck...  question may arise wats it got to do with leadership...but thats the point. Sport teams always represent real life scenario in a ways and forms one cannot any where and are able to show us how to break free of them. In case of Detroit, they were the underdogs, but coach Larry Brown was able to instill a level of confidence in them, make them believe that they can do it. Offcourse make them feel secure where they were and make them realise why they were there.   Irfan Pathan made a statement about Ganguly today, "he made me feel so secure". This security so very important that make people go lot of distance once they get it. Our india cricket team performance is attribute a lot to Ganguly cause of the confidence he could instill in all the young guys. But is security and confidence the only reasons for success?  Not necessary, but yes they are definitely one of the key ingredients....but how does that relate to my day to day work. Thats where the team comes in, every one in a team has aspirations, goals and insecurities. A managers job would be understand them and try to strike a balance between what the individuals are and wat the team requires, but as a leader you have to go one step ahead and provide the vision and goal to the team. The goal shouldnt be handed but understood and appreciated by one and all. If the leader is able to rise above being a manager and accept his responsibilities then he would be able to lead the team to great hieghts like never before. Each individual would able to meet his aspirations along with meeting the teams goals.   Striking that balance is hard, but achieving it will bring utmost success.
