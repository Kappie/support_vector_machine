Photos are online,  urlLink check them out .  We were back on sunday and I spent yesterday trying to clean up some of the clutter in the garage. In other news, we might have finally resolved the situation with the monitor at home. If all goes well, we should have a new 19" monitor soon. Nothing much else to post right now, later!
