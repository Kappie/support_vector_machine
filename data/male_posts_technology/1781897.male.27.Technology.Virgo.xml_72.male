Celebrate every day and recognize the beauty its everything I wish I could be.  Just the same stars in everybody's sky stop and take a look and it will blow your mind.  Stand still, breathe, absorbing everything and wonder what the night will bring.  Celebrate every day and recognize the beauty. Its everything I wish I could be.  Lay down the negatives and don't cloud up the picture. Its everything I wish I could see.  And don't forget me, when I'm around no more. Please don't regret me, just promise me you'll live every day and recognize the beauty.  Its everything I wish you could see!  Oh, so long, so long, I'm wishing you well.
