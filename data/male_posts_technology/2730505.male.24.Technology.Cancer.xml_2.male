This will be interesting since I haven't seen their network/IT infrastructure or have done this sort of extensive work before.  I guess I also want to do a good job so that they pay me well and then refer me to their other doctor/non doctor buddies to upgrade their current IT infrastructure / SOHO network and expand from there.  While tonight I see myself doing some laundry while playing KOTOR.  I think I am almost done with the first time of playing the game.  I suppose I shouldn't go out tonight since I will have to be up somewhat early tomorrow and be all professional and such.  Sounds like another boring Friday for Gonzo.  No pain, No gain.
