To round it off,  Rifts  wa cancelled as 2/3 of the players would rather watch the football, relegating me to playing  UFO: Aftermath .  It has been a depressing day.  Not to mention starting to read  Armor  at last.  My initial thoughts:  (1) Compared with  The Forever War  and  Starship Troopers , Armor is written in a very frantic style at an almost breakneck pace.  While it might suit some people, it only serves to annoy me.  I prefer a more relaxed pace, that allows me to absorb the information I'm reading, not having it all thrown in my face at once. (2) The chapters are either insanely long or there aren't any chapters.  I skipped ahead 50 pages to see if there was one (I prefer reading by chapters) and found no evidence of such. (3) The page formatting is annoying, as the left page appears to disappear into the spine of the book, making it tricky for me to read.  It appears I have the 1984 printing, and I'm wondering if it has been reprinted at all?  The story itself is adequate... perhaps my expectations are too high or I'm simply coming down from the high of The Forever War.  At least I have 3 out of 4 replies for my  PBeM , and I completed  Starcraft  again today, after two and a half hours of struggle against the Overmind.  I dropped a nuke on the bastard, and four others next to its Hives... lots of fun.  This is my first 'legitimate' completion of the game... when I first got it, as I was close to the end, I bought  Brood War  (Starcraft's expansion) and wanted to play it.  I got more than a little frustrated with Protoss Mission 9 (" Shadow Hunters ") so I... err... skipped it, and completed Mission 10 (the last one, which was actually easier by comparison).  Since then, I've gone back and completed the game properly, including not skipping Protoss Mission 9.  I think I'll give Brood War another go... although the final few Zerg missions are nigh-on impossible...  Either that or its back to  Homeworld: Cataclysm .
