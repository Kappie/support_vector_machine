I'm practically obliged to, since I get a half day holiday to go.    My favorite part was definitely the parade.  Although people will complain about how many fire trucks there were, or schools of little twirler-girls, or that it happened to be three and a half hours long, no one is ever in a bad mood while it's going on.  The best was either the "Rollerettes" (the souped-up twirlers on roller skates with accompanying First-Aid van) or the tractors.  Yes, I'm a sucker for a big red Super-M.    The Fair itself was great too.  There's more good food than you could ever eat in a single week (or afford).  Concerts (although I didn't go to any, Clay Aiken's not my type), rides and games too.  I really enjoyed the exhibits- pictures and produce and floral arrangements and every barnyard animal.  But I think the best is that for one week out of the year, everyone is gathered in merry-making and rejoicing, even thanking the Lord for what He has done in the last year and that we all come back for another ride on the Ferris Wheel.  It's probably the closest thing we have to a Christian Festival, where the lemonade and cheesesteaks overflow.
