Things worked out after all, but my absentmindedness is getting out of hand. I'll have to start considering ways to organise my life properly. **NOTE: This is version two of this post. The first was in the wrong language. Q.E.D.**  I'm expecting southbound visitors in the morning, the day after that I'm supposed to participate in a wedding, as best man. At the same time, my computer's chosen to make my life even less peaceful, but fortunately some alternative drivers was available. They're not quite as good, but for the moment I'm satisfied with them working at all.  I rented a suit for the wedding, it was picked up today and is black and quite neat. I'll probably have to borrow a tie from dad, as I have none of my own...or maybe I do have one. We'll see.  But, anywho, that's it from me for today. B'bye.
