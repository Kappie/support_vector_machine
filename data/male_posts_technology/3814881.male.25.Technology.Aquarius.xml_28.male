Since I was alone (I've learned that I should only try this on my own, since some people consider recreation at my intensity a little less than restful), I hiked from the top of the mountain to the river, and fished my way back up.  Took four hours, but I caught thirty-five trout, and managed to catch my limit of nice fat brookies.  The nicest is posted below.    And on the way out, I saw my elk again.  He's an 11x11, just a gorgeous creature.  And I saw a bobcat and an eight-point whitetail.  Is it fall yet?      urlLink       urlLink
