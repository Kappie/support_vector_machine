I just remember my failed attempts to right a TCP/IP stack (not using php though :)..)during my college third year hols because of the lack of specs on the ethernet driver we were using. It was throwing us some arbit shit of packets of packets to us...  And I also remember the brawl with one of my fren regarding this TCP/IP project...  It was my dream project that time never got accomplished but i did manage to write a packet analyser for all the three layers..  ( Ethernet 802.3, IP, TCP , UDP ).. using which we planned to hack/hijack the connections that were going to a nearby machine used by our class gals :D...  The problem with me even now is that I take some things very close to my heart (more importantly without any reasons), even though many of my frens think that they are not deserved to be given such an importance...
