Sure is, and this one is even tougher to resolve than TCA.  As readers of this Blog know, Vinterus Technologies has resolved the TCA issue using a product known as Wine Rescue.  (scheduled to be release in 2004).    Ladybug taint is much worse in many ways.  The asian ladybugs arrived in North America in 2001, and brought with them solutions for soybean growers and massive headaches for winemakers.  The asian ladybugs were introduced to destroy "naturally" the tiny soybean aphids that were destroying soybean crops in US and Canada.  Once they eat all the aphids, they are still hungry so they go after the pests in the vineyards.  The problem here, is that they stay on the vines until harvest, and when ladybugs are frightened they secret an obnoxiously bitter liquid containing pyrazine.  Pyrazine has an odor/flavor all of its own, but many liken it to cooked spinach or rancid peanuts. (neither too appetizing).  It seems that starting in 2001 ladybugs and their secretions where harvested in Canada and US along with grapes, and caused an uproar with the growing Ontario wine region. Many top flight wines were rendered undrinkable due to this taint.  The problem with pyrazine though, is that it is a chemical very unlike TCA in that it cannot be removed either in the winery or using Wine Rescue.  The problem is that pyrazine is very water soluble, and thus not a good candidate for removal using Wine Rescue.    This brings us to the concept of MOG, which many of you may know or not know.  MOG refers to "Material Other than Grape" that comes along with the grape at harvest.  When these "other materials", including ladybugs and their secretions, are crushed and fermented along with the grape, anything can happen. Please note:  bugs normally don't taste good and they do...er poop!  Generally speaking, MOG is not a problem as concentrations are low and imperceptable in the wine. The real issue is when MOG is substantial, like the ladybug taint.  This goes to the theory of unintended consequences.  The greens among us would rather use biological systems rather than pesticides to control pests, include soybean aphids.  Thousands of cases of wine, destroyed due to this unintended consequence of introducing these ladybugs rather than use totally acceptably safe pesticides (approved by both US and Canadian Environmental Authorities).   While I don't want to fill my fine Riedel crystal with pesticide, I think that judicious use would be the prudent course.  The ladybug was the first of many pests introduced to control others, what's next?    Next time, the alchemy of fermentation!
