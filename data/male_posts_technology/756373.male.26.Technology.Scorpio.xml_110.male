I swear I could see Bush smirking at the fat french toadies stupidity as he mumbled it.  "Over the past 10 days, Bush has attempted to link the overthrow of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein with the struggle to defeat Nazism in World War II. He even quoted from Supreme Allied Commander Dwight Eisenhower’s message to U.S., British and Canadian troops on the eve of D-Day during a commencement address last week at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  In their news conference yesterday in Paris, Chirac flatly rejected that comparison.  'History does not repeat itself,' he said. 'It is very difficult to compare historical situations that differ, because history is not repetitive.'"  History does not  repeat itself ? Is he  serious ? That's just about the stupidest thing I've heard uttered from the mouth of a politician  ever .
