I would like to say that aside from his smelly odor and occasional idiotic interjections, Nick Rice isn't a bad kid, but he just gets a bad rap from other kids who are looking for somebody to pick on.  People need to lay off of Nick and find someone else to pick on, someone else who really sucks at life like.....ehh, better not finish this thought.  So after lifting I was just kinda sleepily driving down Commercial on my way home, and on the edge of the street, right in front of First State Bank was a golden retriever.  The retriever was going crazy makin babies with this black mutt right there in plain view of all the cars.  Completely inappropriate :P  You know your life is getting boring when you start talking about dogs...nevermind. Anyway I went home and took a 4 or so hour nap on this really comfortable recliner in the living room, so now I'm feelin quite rested :D
