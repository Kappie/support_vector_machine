I  just fail to see why I should be obliged to  send traffic his way simply because he's one of a rare breed (Southern African blogger) when there's just too much of a personal vendetta/crusade against myself emanating there, with ad-hominem after ad-hominem being launched by himself and his sycophants.  On a side note, perhaps it's a good sign, indicative of a healthy divide/debate (although to fodder  co, debate seems to be defined as primarily taking shots at your opponents' characters... so maybe not  that  healthy) on the relevant issues, instead of everyone unquestioningly believing only one set of 'truths'. Perhaps Southern Africa is maturing to the point where we question things, and try and make up our own minds instead of just 'going with the flow' and, to put forth an example, voting ANC/Swapo/whatever simply 'because everyone else is'.  That's the  first  beartrap Africa has to squirrel it's way out of. Herd mentality.
