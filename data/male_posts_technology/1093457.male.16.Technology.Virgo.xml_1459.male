This blog is an online diary not for articles etc.. unless you feel them important enough to mention when writing about you day and things. Tom no one is attacking you, everyone is just stressed and whatnot at the moment so I think we all need to relax a bit. David you need to relax. If people need to blog I'll write they need to as I usually do. But at the moment if people don't blog its fine, exams, good reason. So calm down, just blog when you want so long as you blog regulary. And please, little bitchiness. Its onvious you two clash a bit. Just calm...
