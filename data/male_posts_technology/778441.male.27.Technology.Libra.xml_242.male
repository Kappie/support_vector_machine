Like Fellowship, the first date is the release of the DVD, and the November date is the release of the special edition (with rumored extra 48 minutes of footage).  Another good link is provided by theonering.net and has some more info about the actual footage.  [link via  urlLink Slashdot ] This news is like sweet music for all LoTR fans! And the icing on the cake is the fact that the final part of the LoTR trilogy,  urlLink The Return of the King  is slated for worldwide release less than a month after the Special Edition DVD of The Two Towers comes out,  i.e.  on 17th December 2003. So, mark down that date on your calendars too! :-)
