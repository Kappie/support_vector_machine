I've had two emails to yahoo addresses sent from my Hotmail account come back "This message has been delayed", and it's really getting on my nerves.  Other than that... lets see here.  Oh, last night at the fair was fun! I left work at my normal time and went out to Katy's and we just hung around until other people came (Katie was there too)... then we all hung around for a while longer and finally went to the fair. Marjen came so some of us (the ones who didn't want to ride rides) went to meet her while the rest of the people went to do their thing. Umm... then we went to Burgerville and got some food and then we hung out for more time at the fair. I dunno, the fair is cool n' all but gets old fast. I like the tractors though, I could play on the tractors for like hours...  After the fair we all went back to Katy's house and watched Signs in the dark. It wasn't really too creepy, and I discovered I can make the clicking sound the aliens make (it freaks Katy out).  I got home around 1:30am yet still managed to wake up for work this morning... somehow.  I was going to go to a party tonight but I think I will skip it so I'm better able to plan for the weekend... yeah. I could probably get it so my mom would let Sarah come over, but I'm gonna see about going out there and then I'll do the stuff and maybe she can come over next weekend... it'd be cool if we could keep her overnight and bring her to Church again on Sunday too.  Yeah... I'm like killer tired.        On an occaision of this kind it becomes more than a moral duty to speak one's mind. It becomes a pleasure. - Oscar Wilde, from The Importance of Being Earnest
