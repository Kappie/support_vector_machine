Atthe time, I was playing basketball as a freshman in high school and a few of the senior players christened me with the nickname, loosely translated to mean 'a slow, tall, thin,uncoorindated white kid'. Which, as it turned out, was an accurate enough description that the alias stayed with me to some extent throughout high school (eventually shortened to just Obie by some) , into years where there were no Kansas City Kings, and nobody even remembered where the nickname came from anymore.
