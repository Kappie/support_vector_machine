Sir Kicks told me that we need to talk. Suddenly, he told Sir Joey to go out of the server room for a while. It was very indifferent. I immediately catch his drift; I know it has something to do with my employment status.  I was right. It was my last day working with them.  As I read the memo my brain cells stopped working for a minute or two. I wanted to shed a single tear but I know it'll only make me feel less. I talked with my boss, faced him bravely enough to accept it. He said his sorry although there's no need for him to say so. I know he was defending me from the very start that all those false accusation are being thrown over me. All of them (the team) have been very supportive. I caught myself between the words "thank you" and "I'm sorry". Thank you for giving me the chance working with such professionals, I'm sorry if I have failed meeting his expectations. I don't know how I will tell it to him.   He told me to seek legal advice and talk with my accusers regarding that false accusation to clear my name. I thought of it at first but then I realized a day after that it was too late and I won't need it anymore. Case closed. Besides, talking with "Ricky" is like kissing a dog's ass; I won't care to kiss a dog's ass just to retain my job. It'll definitely lessen my morale. I can stand up for what I know is right and I can defend myself without any legal advises. Legalities and technicalities of the law are only for people with fear of losing. Their lost of confidence to a certain issue tends them to seek higher knowledge. I don't need higher knowledge to save myself. As long as I did not do anything wrong I don't care what other people would think of me. It's just that some people are unfair enough. They have been very subjective and judgmental about the matter. Maybe fear must have also conquered them the first time I wrote my correspondence. They never gave me the chance to speak out, they never let me faced my accusers, they never showed any benefit of the doubt and then I'll received this memo that they have found me guilty?  Hence it was really an  "ouch"  to be stabbed from behind but what hurt me most is that the fact that I have learned to treat the MIS team as a second family. The bonding was so strong. I love my job. I have been very dedicated to it through all those months kahit I have this  "tardi-sickness" , from thinking about tomorrow's tasks before going to sleep to carrying and doing my job at home. I don't even had time going online talking with my underground friends or those personal ones. I knew it's not only me who will going to earn pogi points once I finish my tasks but the whole team. The reason why I always put the word "TEAM" in every task I do. For me, dedication is not counted by long hours of work. It is measured by a person's willingness to perform tasks with accuracy against all the intellectual and physical challenges he might encounter.   All of them are team players. It was really an unforgettable experienced working with such good people.  I smiled, surrendered my I.D, we went out of the server room and I started packing my stuffs. I even forgot my digicam's USB cable. Sir Joey was asking me what we have talked. He has this bad intuition. I told him it was  "confidential" , good news and a bad news. He said  "tangina kinakabahan ako ah"  :) I pretend to be completely oblivious about it.  We went to chicharitos and had some drink although we're quite incomplete. After that, Sir Dan, Sir Joey, Jonathan and me took a cab while Judith, Jen, Oliver and Sir Kim joined Roman in his toy car. We went to Bay Walk. Jonathan was advising me how to make a move on Tin-Tin, I just can't tell him that moment it'll be the last time I'll be able to see that girl :)   After consuming few beers we walked and went to that acoustic place in Malate. That was the last hop. After in which Sir Joey reminded me about what we have talked a while ago. I don't want to speak up but because it'll be my last time I said my farewell.   Surely God has better plans regarding this. I dunno what'll happen next. Either I'll be working with the same job in the next few months or continue studying.  For now, I'm a total bum.  Hayyy... It's already 2:30 in the morning. I need to get myself some sleep. Gonna finish watching Smallville cd's tomorrow.
