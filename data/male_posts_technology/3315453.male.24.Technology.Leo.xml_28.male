Also I am looking for another part time job.    Becca is also not going to school over the summer because she wants to go to China, through her school, this summer for about 3 weeks.  So she had to choose between school or China because her financial aid would only cover one.  She is still not sure if she will be able to go, but we are trying our best to scrap together money because this would be a great experience for her.  In the mean time she is looking for a summer job to help pay for it.  As far as grades go here is what Becca received, she did very well: Chinese - 3.9 History of Modern Ethics - 3.7 Ethics - 4.0  By the way the Ethics class was a 400 level class and she got the best grade in the class.  I am very proud of her.  As for me, I won't get my grades until next week.
