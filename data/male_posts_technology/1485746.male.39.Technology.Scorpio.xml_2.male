You see, I have a friend who just recently picked up XBL and CS.  He is not into racing, so I rejoined my Crimson Skies experience so that I can give him a proper pasting when we meet online.  It's not easy.  On "hard" difficulty, I got snagged fairly early on in the game.  For sake of breaking the frustration barrier, I started a new game on "moderate" difficulty and went through several missions fairly quickly.  I anticipate more soon, now that I am catching up on my movie backlog.
