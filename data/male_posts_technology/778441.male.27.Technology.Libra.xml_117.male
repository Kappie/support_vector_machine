Are we a nation of ethically corrupt masses? ... Or are we just a nation of people tired to cut through the bureaucratic red-tape? ... so tired, that we prefer to pay bribes rather than suffer inordinate delays in whatever we try to do?  We all make noises that we should decrease corruption and stop paying bribes. But do we pay any heed to our own voices? Is this our motto...  What we need is either less corruption, or more chance to participate in it.   And, honestly, how many times did you have to pay bribes during the last one year?
