It looks like the Salsa Jet might become something they do every two months which would be EXCELLENT if they pull it off (And Josh hasn't barred me...)  Anywho, back to work for the moment.. If possible I will try and write a full blog later (Yes, I do know I left out all the Juicy details.. Go Suck a lemon)
