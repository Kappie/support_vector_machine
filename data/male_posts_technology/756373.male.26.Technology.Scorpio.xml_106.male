Slowly. Very slowly. World opinion  will  change to view the Coalition's defiance of the UN in invading Iraq and finishing what they started over a decade ago, as a good thing. For all the huff and bluster today, future generations will see what we have witnessed this past year as a justice being done, of good prevailing and evil being overcome. Of that, I'm certain. Come June 30, with Iraq in Iraq's hands and little left to cause division among the Allies - instead a common goal uniting them once more (this time the eradication of Islamic Terrorism instead of Nazism and Communism), the day will be marked as the day Islamic fundamentalist terrorism was defeated idealogically. Despite the militias, despite the beheadings, despite the  urlLink failed attempts at using hostages and ransoms  to bully those terrorism deemed 'weak', Iraq will be free. Spain will be remembered for the cowards who abandoned the oppressed Iraqi people this time. And no amount of self-destructive whining from the left can stop it.
