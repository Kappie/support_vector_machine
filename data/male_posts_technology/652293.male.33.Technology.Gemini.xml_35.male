I am always looking for articles from the masses.  You.  Specifically.  Topics range from issue to issue, but as you might suspect it revolves around usability.  Let  urlLink me  know if you are interested in writing about any studies, work, success stories, horror stories, etc.  Oh, and !happy v-day.
