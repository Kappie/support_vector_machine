Well I am fairly certain that if I pick up that phone again (looking at old phone) it'll be dead, and I don't have the Dr. Adara's cell number -never asked Zara for it - and my guess is that he wouldn't answer anyway - even if I did have it.  So..... let's see what happens - pick up old phone and place it to my ear....
