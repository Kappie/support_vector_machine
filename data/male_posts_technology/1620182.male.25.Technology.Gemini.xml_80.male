 The weather has been very Seattle-esque lately here on the island.  For almost a week its been cool with lots of rain and fog.  I was on my way out to the garage at work when the car next to mine caught my eye last night.  It had two bumper stickers on it.  The one that caught my eye said 1800 in big letters with JPA next to it.  I thought, that's odd.  Then I looked across to the other sticker which said "U-Heights."  Wow.  I guess all of the UVA grads here are work-aholics.  I'm glad I'm not the only one.
