Rounding the bend in Buccleauch Park, right after the apartments I could feel the wind blasting into my face and it felt like my whole body was frozen through. I think I'll do really well in Push-ups and situps tomorrow on the diagnostic, however, as I almost floated through those events (admittedly I was only doing the 60 percent minimum) All in all I'm feeling pretty good about the performance, though I have to admit that it was one of the hardest things that I've ever done/managed to accomplish.
