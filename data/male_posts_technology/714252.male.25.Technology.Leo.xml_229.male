Ash has finaly blogged again and that's about it really..  Birthday plans are a bit fupped.. Have to change from Sin to somewhere else (at the moment Capitol is looking most likely because I can't be bothered going very far from RiRa..)  Might blog more later.. Might not.. What you gonna do about it eh?
