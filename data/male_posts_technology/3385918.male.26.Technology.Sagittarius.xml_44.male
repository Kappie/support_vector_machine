Had some probs yesterday)   Pretty good stuff, actually. But I wouldn't expect nothing less since on Sunday we have a Bad Blood, a RAW PPV. This show had to deliver and I think it did, with a few minor complaints.  Show started off with a number one contenders match between Lita and Gail Kim. The winner would go off and fight with Victoria for the Woman's championship. Pretty well paced match with some awesome submition moves by the very sexy and flexible Gail Kim. Lita was ok...  What's my gripe for this match? Lita won. WTF???? Haven't we seen weeks and weeks of development story between Victoria and Kim (actually, just Kim beating up people and Victoria silly dancing)? What happened here? Does the WWE have little faith in Gail Kim? She's hot. She is doing very well. Both Gail Kim and Victoria have the potential to put women wrestling on the map. What gives?  Victoria VS Lita for Bad Blood. Doesn't feel right. Heck, it turns out not to be right cause we later find out that the women's match at Bad Blood with be a four way match. WTF? What brought this on? This is the reason why the women's' matches are shit. They have no credibility.   Now, for Bad Blood we have Victoria VS Lita VS Gail Kim VS Trish  Another gripe. We were being feed two different storylines about women wrestlers that were not wrestling. These were the Trish - Christian - Tomko - Jericho and the Lita - Kain - Matt Hardy angle. One of the angles was working pretty well, the other (*cough* *cough* Lita *cough*) wasn't. So, now, without any explanation, they are combined and thrown together with the Victoria - Gail feud (which wasn't any better). This suck.   Next we had Batista VS Shelton Benjamin, which was pretty good. I taught Batista looked pretty good and powerful here. Had a lot of personality.  Funny how Batista, who was nothing less than a joke in the ring a year ago, has improved dramatically. This guy is starting to show a lot of potential. Not to mention that he looks very powerful. Having Shelton Benjamin as your opponent and being part of the Evolution stable hasn't hurt either.  The crowd was into the match. Shelton Benjamin looses the match when Randy Orton intervenes. An Evolution beat down follows, thereby setting up the Randy Orton VS Shelton Benjamin match at Bad Blood. Very good stuff (even taught the beat downs are getting really old).  Next Chris Jericho def. A-Train in a surprisingly interesting exchange. I had forgotten A - TRain was traded to RAW. I always forget to watch HEAT, so I hadn't seen the guy wrestler for RAW yet. Interesting how there was a pretty big stretch of time when we were forced to endure an elephant size push for this guy at Smackdown. Same push was given to Big Show, who took the opportunity and ran with it, making him a credible main event wrestler. A - Train didn't. Now he is jobbing on RAW.   On a side note, this Smackdown main event push was given to Hardcore Holly on his return with disastrous results. It is currently being given to Bradshaw which may or may not work. While Bradshaw is generating a lot of heat, it's not bringing in the numbers. And, sadly, it's making Eddie Guerrero look bad. And, boy, is Eddie trying really hard to make things work. It's not his fault the numbers are down. A year ago, Smackdown was the show to see. Now, it's become a sad joke.  Eddie Guerrero hasn't been the same since his match with Bradshaw at Judgement Day. All that bleeding really did a number on him. It's odd cause Eddie Guerrero has been a top class wrestler since returning a while back to the WWE. He worked hard, wrestled great and won every bit of the title push he has. Currently, he seems to be loosing focus. He has to get his head straight.   Apparently, Eddie got into an incident with the crowd of a show in Germany (the same place where a day earlier Bradshaw unwisely did some Nazi gestures to get some heat from the local crowd). This isn't the first time Eddie has gotten into problems with the crowd. I believe this is the third time since returning. He got into a fight because some dumb fan pored beer on him. Recently I heard that he fought with a fan because he threw something at one of his daughter's during a show. Oh, there was also that time where another dumb fuck entered the ring during a ladder match. That was live on RAW. Funny shit. Eddie took a swing at him. I believe it connected too. With Germany, this would be four times that he has gotten into a situation with the crowd. Granted, the first three times weren't really his fault. Even taught, one would stress that if he got mad at someone, he should try something different. Not just jump on the person and beat the crap out of him. If the WWE lets him do it several times, he'll just keep doing it and, eventually, it will ruin this fantastic wrestlers opportunities.  When Eddie Guerrero and Benoir won their respective brand's main title, it was taught that Eddie, and not Benoir, could have the potential to hold the title and the crowds interest till at least the end of the year. Also, Eddie didn't have to work with HHH. Now, the tables have turned. Benoir has been a big success in his title run. He is also giving an 100% and is putting on some good wrestling matches. Proof of this is that on Bad Blood he has two, not one, two matches! (A little more about that later)  I will say this, even with Benoir's successful run, the WWE might give us a curve ball and have Benoir loose his title at Bad Blood to Kain, so they can continue to feud until HHH is ready to step in and take his title back (even taught I think that HHH already proved what he set out to do; which is probably the reason that he is currently putting over up and coming talent like Shelton Benjamin).   I believe that Eddie Guerrero's reign as champion is  almost over. The sad part is that there is currently no worthy wrestler in Smackdown can make a credible champion beyond Mr. Guerrero. Angle has an injury and won't be wrestling much. Bradshaw... Please !!! Big Show is out too. Hardcore Holly is a joke. Booker T has had his credibility shot to pieces too many times. All the other worthy champions are in RAW... oh, God... No... The Undertaker... Nooooooooooo !!!  WWE... One person can save Smackdown. RVD !!! RVD !!! RVD !!! Give this guy a chance at a run for the title... Watch your ratings rise (bring on those ECW chants !!!).  Anyway, I digress. Back to RAW. Next match is...   A Handicap Match where La Resistance takes on Chris Benoir. La Resistance wins by disqualification when Edge gets involved. Benoir looked pretty bad in this match. Like if he was holding back. Guess the WWE taught that it would look bad if Benoir folded La Resistance by himself. Would hurt the teams credibility, which was pretty up after the win at Montreal. A win for the frenchies, even if it was a DQ, is a good idea, but why make Benoir seem so week.   Eric Bischoff comes out and announces that because of Edge's interference, we get La Resistance VS Benoir  Edge at Bad Blood. Yes, Benoir will have to fight twice at that PPV. If it was the Undertaker, I'd vomit. But Benoir is okay. Angle fought three times at one of the King of the Ring (The first two matches sucked, but the third against Shane McMahon was a really surprise; probably one of the best matches in WWE history due to the type of damage these two took).  Eric them makes another handicap match.  Kane  La Resistance VS Benoir  Edge to start... NOW !!! I actually love when the WWE does shit like that. Anyway, good match, but Benoir is made to look very week and, if that wasn't enough, they are starting to hint at a Benoir VS Edge match, maybe for the Summer Slam PPV. Not bad, but we've seen this crap before (*cough* *cough* Angle  Benoir *cough*).  I believe that around this part of the program, Bischoff announced that  Chris Jericho will battle the "Problem Solver," Tyson Tomko, at Bad Blood. This could be a good match.  He also announced the fatal four way women's match... Doh!  We have a segment with Kain confronting Lita. Kain tells her that he was responsible for given her a shot at the title (damn, and here I taught that the stupid WWE writers where the guilty ones). Lita tells Kain that he has said "it" was over and Kain responds that he lied. When they say "It", I believe they are referring to this stupid story line.   Expect either Lita (Grrr!) or Kain (Yuck!) or both (Bleh!) to win a title at Bad Blood.   Oh, and Uncle Eric also made a match with Jonathan Coachman going against Eugene at Bad Blood. Funny how Jonathan Coachman has an undefeated PPV record.   When Bischoff's assistant, Johnny Nitro, acted overly arrogant, Bischoff forced Nitro to take on Eugene with Nitro's job on the line. Now, this is very pointless. And, please, how many times have we seen this?   Anyway, Eugene pinned Nitro, so I guess he's fired.   Funny match, taught. The crowd really liked Eugene and, boy, does this wrestler know how to play the crowd! The other wrestlers should take note.  Last match of the night was Shawn Michaels VS Randy Orton. Great match. These two work pretty well with each other. Ended in a DQ. Boo !!! Anyway, they had to do this to set up the Shawn Michaels VS HHH in a Hell in the Cell Match at Bad Blood. I have a feeling that these two are gonna make it a very memorable and bloody match.  Great show. Good build up to Bad Blood. I'd say a B+ show (almost an A-). Good job! The show is back on track and this Bad Blood PPV sounds like a keeper.   I will be posting tomorrow my thoughts on the Bad Blood card. See you then. (^_^)   urlLink Sailor Ecchi
