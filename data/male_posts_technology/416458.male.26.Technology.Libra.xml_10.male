Listening to the above, been a long time since I listener to the chart, got some work experience 16 year old presenting it now, or something.  Just me in the office all weekend, going stir-crazy, but Craig is about to drag me out for a quick drink to give me a break. Anyway, things are going quite well. I just tried to call the boss, let him know about the minor success I just had, but I got nothin'! Feeling a distinct lack of support from the company, which might not be totally unfair as it is me that's late on deivering, but it's not all my fault.  Ah well, guess I'll post more later.
