I am referring to  urlLink this thread  on Prophecy. The one about the whole skinny women and eating disorders thing. It wasn't long before terms like 'misogynist' and 'male chavinist' were being thrown around carelessly like confetti at a wedding. I stated in that thread that the thoughtless use of a term like 'misogynist' is akin to labelling someone a racist for merely stating the obvious - that most crimes around the world are committed by black people. Now, I am far from a racist - racism in any form sickens me to my stomach, but the plain  fact  is that, statistically, black people are more likely to engage a criminal lifestyle than any other race. I have no concrete ideas as to why - I can only surmise that perhaps it's because , in South Africa, such a large percentage of them live in squalid conditions and have little alternatives to crime in order to secure the money needed to survive. However, this does not explain why the majority of crimes in, for example, America - the land of the free and equal opportunity - are committed by African-Americans. Who happen to be a minority there. It's curious. But I digress. There comes a point in an argument where you just don't get a kick out of it anymore. Quoting facts and figures and statistics, arguing with logic and reason, helps  zilch  if the other party refuses to dance to the same beat. It illustrates another huge difference between the sexes - a man knows when to give up, he knows when he's beaten, he knows when he's  wrong . But as any guy who's had an argument with a girlfriend/wife/sister/etc can attest to, women are  never  wrong. They have this remarkarble knack of twisting an argument around to make  you  look like the one with the problem. The female version of the verbal rope-a-dope. And like dopes we always fall for the trap. We guys can never, ever win an argument with a woman if we try and win it on their terms. They'll always get the last word, they'll always make it look like the fact that they are fucked in the head is somehow our fault. You know the drill. "It's men's fault that we starve ourselves because it's men that pressure us to look like this because men like skinny women". Newsflash. Go take a look through Playboy and Penthouse before assuming that what men want are the ridiculously thin models in Cosmo mag. Guys don't like women who are too thin, or too fat, and I think the most important thing in a good looking woman is a pretty face. You'll certainly NEVER find an anorexic in a men's mag. I'll tell you one thing, working in an office with two other women is really enlightening. The shit they talk about... Anyway, enough of this battle of the sexes thing. It's a fight that's been fought for generations, with no clearly discernable winner, and no obvious, forseeable winner (if there can even be one) for some time to come. I wash my hands of the whole thing. --- In other news : It's funny how some computer games - often the ones you love the most - can incite emotions like rage and anger and fear and jubilation in a person. I am referring to multiplayer Warcraft 3 here. I happen to be one of those un-competitive gamers out there, I try not to take it all too seriously, I certainly don't spend every waking hour away from work practicing. When Counterstrike was the order-of-the-day, I would play it on weekends only. CS never really got me hot and bothered. If I was winning, I was winning, If I was losing, so what. It's been the same with most FPS games - Quake3, UT, and so on. I never really felt the desire to be good at them. I never took them seriously. They were just games. But Warcraft 3 is another story. I find myself  wanting  to play, to practice, every night, whether it be versus a PC AI or against other players on Battle.Net. When I win, I feel good about myself. When I lose, I feel like the greatest failure on the planet, and that feeling incites me to perhaps try again and do better. Being in a clan like  urlLink Chickenhead , a clan where 'l337ness' is not required, perhaps even discouraged, helps remind me that despite winning a goodly portion of games, I am no better than anyone else. Losing to some seriously skilled players is very humbling as well. However, being the usual 'whipping boy' in FPS's, the taste of victory in an Warcraft3 is especially compelling, a feeling I've never really known. It's a feeling one could get used to, but should'nt. I can imagine myself turning into one of those 'l337' players who look down on and sneer at the none-too-skilled usual players. It's a scary thought. I never want to become part of that class of gamer, but at least now I understand  why  they exist.  This weekends diary looked something like this. -Friday night, play some Battle.net. Win a few games. Notice ego swelling. -Saturday. LAN. Win every Warcraft3 game. On the way home Saturday night realise I may have, in the heat of the moment, said a number of stupid things to people I regard as friends. Feelings of regret surface. -Sunday. Sleep late. Play some Magic the Gathering. See my ass. Ego deflates. Watch Black Knight. Terrible, terrible movie, waste of 20 bucks, wish I could go back in time and kick myself for choosing to watch that. Should have watched Spiderman again. Go home, play some Tribes2 online but PC freezes up twice thanks to new graphics card. Quit in disgust. Watch Cast Away. Excellent movie, I realise afterwards that sometimes life is just about the luck of the draw - just keep going, something might go right someday. Sleep, go to work, write this load of trash, work for 10 minutes, wonder what to do for the rest of the day. Realise I am lucky to have a job where I can sit around on my ass bored out of my skull for most of the day.  peace, out.
