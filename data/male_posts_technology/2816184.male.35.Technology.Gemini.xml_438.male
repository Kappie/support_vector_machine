Dragonfly: Illusion - Transcendence   The dragonfly, creature of the winds, represents the tricking of the senses and change. Its iridescent wings are reminiscent of magical times and, thus, let us realize that there is only seeming reality in this world.  The dragonfly teaches that nothing is quite the way it seems, and that is therefore necessary not to allow our senses to be tricked. Furthermore, the dragonfly conveys messages from elementary beings and plant spirits.   If you wish to make changes, call to the energy of the dragonfly.
