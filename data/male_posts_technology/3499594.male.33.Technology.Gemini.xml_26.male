It was a good stop and let us stretch our legs. The Chapel was immaculate. Not very big but the paintings were unbelievably beautifull. It was definitely off the beaten path but it was a nice place.   We also were on the look out for cops. Can't help it, driving for so long on these kind of trip. I rarely seen one, unless he had some poor slob over on the road. We passed one poor soul and noticed his buddy was also ahead on the side of the road waiting for him. The truck then later on down the road zoomed passed us, evidently not learning his lesson. "Nuts" My wife noticed it was the same truck that was just getting a ticket then I noticed his bumper sticker and understood why. The poor soul was an idiot and crazy driver. The bumper sticker? " Vote for Kerry "  We stayed over at a hotel while we checked some of the stores there. The kids was able to play in the pool for a little bit that night. I visited the 'Bass Pro Shop'. I haven't fished nor hunted in years but we were told we had to check it out. It was really cool. They had everything imaginable in there. All forms of stuffed animals mounted, including a large bear you could take a picture with. A stream literally ran through the store with live fish, ducks ect. Nothing like I expected. The place was HUGE. We had to hit  a Target and ate at Ruby Tuesday's since we don't have that restruant around our place.  The next morning we hit the road early and drove on into St. Louis. It's the first time any of my family been here, so were all psyched. I had to come through the airport on the way to Pennsylvania a couple of times , but that doesnt count. We found the hotel and were meeting some friends here as well. They drove in from up north so were looking forward to it. I personally just enjoy being away from work and house.  We plan to see the arch tomorrow and go up into it. We have a pretty good view of the arch from our 5th floor and the hotel is nice. I will try to post a pic or two of it. I plan to take alot of digital pics as I have a 64 mg card and my PC. So I can continue to  download and clean my card througout these days of vacation. Its 9:17 p.m. and the wife and kids are already out. The kids played hard and wore us out. heh heh
