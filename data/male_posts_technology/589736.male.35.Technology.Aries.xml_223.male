     
      Now working by night as Wardrobe Supervisor for Jean Genet's play "Elle," in English-language debut, adapted by  starring Alan Cumming, as the Pope, on roller skates. Also starring Stephen Spinella (2x Tony Award winner for "Angels in America," Drama Desk  Outer Critics Circle awards for "James Joyce's The Dead"), Chad L. Coleman (a VCU alumn!), and Anson Mount (who was just in the Britney Spears movie...). They're all nice, regular guys. Only runs until July 31st. Met Faye Dunaway opening night! I love New York....
