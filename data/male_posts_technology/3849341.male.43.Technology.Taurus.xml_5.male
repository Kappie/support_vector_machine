As I press forward to know god in a deeper manner in this journey called life, I feel as if I been heading up hill doing somersaults over and over again. The Journey uphill is my journey to know an infinite god, who is unknowable, and to do this without limit. Somersaults are the painful but needful life lessons that the lord has allowed me to experience in my walk towards him. I have had to many somersaults to list or share them all. I will say that all though usually painful, I have walked (uphill mind you) away a better person, less dysfunctional than before, and more like Christ. You see, unfortunately I didn't start this journey as a spiritual giant(more like a spiritual mouse), but as a teen who barely survived an extremely dysfunctional upbringing.      So, my last Somersault, very recent I might add, was painful but needed. I have always been one to affirm, speak words of life to friends. What I have had difficulty in doing ever is confronting a friend with correction , or setting proper boundaries with people. I have allowed the fear of loosing a friend allow me to keep my mouth shut when I should open it. In the end, it was like a self repeating prophecy over and over again. I kept my mouth shut in fear and in the end I would still either damage or loose a friendship by not speaking up. Not meaning to, I allowed some of my closest relationships to digress to a sometimes spoken truism "familiarity breeds contempt". To speak truth, when needed, set proper boundaries, along with speaking words of life will go a long way to disproving the truism " familiarity breeds contempt". To sum it up in one word, "Balance". But it is a tricky thing to balance yourself as your walking up hill doing somersaults :)
