I do that all the time, but this isn't about me, it's about you, right? Right? Yeah, thought so.  I think I'm supposed to be writing about my day, but my day sucked a pickle, so that seems no fun! I've already told you my moving traumas, and I have  no  intention of telling anyone about my  sex  love life....in all of its infititesimal (only spelled right) entirety. I cant tell you about my birthday (ten days! Woot!) So, I suppose I may vent my frustrations on you in another way. If you'll grant me permission, I'd like to step out of this little JaQ bubble that I live in and be a bratty, whiny, shallow teenage girl, okie? Okie.   Damn it, damn it, damn it!! There were fifty people there, and I was not in the continental United States! Rosalie was there! 'Tato Legs was there! Infuego was there! Kevin was there! Ashton was there! Let me restate this one last time... EVERYONE WAS THERE, BUT ME!  *Remembers to breathe* I hate the world for making me miss it, but that's really all right. I'm over it. Yes. Yes I am.   There. I feel better now. Thanks for listening. Now that I've completely run out of things to say, I really ought to be going. Goodnight, pip pip and German sex to each and every one of you. Have a nice evening. Ta. Stop staring at me.   ...Dirty stalker...*Glares*
