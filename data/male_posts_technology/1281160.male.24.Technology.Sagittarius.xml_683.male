     
      My terminal is still not working... and I'm still to be released from the project, so not able to spend time with the support people to get my system going... Y'day, I had one of the most frustrating days at work.. got bugged up with the project's PL... just felt for a few moments like bursting out at him... restrained myself... just praying that I get the hell out of this project soon... hopefully, I might get released by the end of next week.. but nothing has been confirmed yet.. hoping for the best...
