My 9 year old has a Little League game tonight at 7:30.  He has to be there at 6:30 to warm up (throw to warm his arm and bat to get his timing).  My wife also works, so one of us has to get home in time to get him there by 6:30. Not too tough usually, but it can be hectic at times.  My mom is in the hospital right now, and I will go by and visit for a few minutes before heading home. If I leave at 5pm, I should be home by 6pm, get a few bites to eat and off to the ballpark.  I really enjoy the games, so I don't mind the hectic pace in the spring.  One thing that does bother me is trying to divide time between my 9 year old's baseball games and my 5 year old's teeball games.  Teeball is boring!  But I have to support my 5 year old.  So far, there have not been any real conflicts.  We also have an 11 month old (birthday on the 13th), that is a live wire. She's daddy's girl. :)  Enough for now.  More ramblings later.
