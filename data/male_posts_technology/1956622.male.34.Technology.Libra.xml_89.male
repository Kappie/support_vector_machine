In fact she started in on me early.  I said Hello and she then started crying and I knew she was faking but I played it up good like oh my what are you crying for and stuff like that.   She yells into the phone.  "I AM JOKING YOU!" and starts to giggle.  So our phone call went on like that at one point I was pretending I was ordering from McDonalds and she says are you ordering food?  So I said no I am joking you!  She laughed and thought that was pretty funny.    At one point she put the phone down and when she came back she says ow daddy that was not nice and I said what and she said you bonked me on the head and I said I did not.  I said who do you think you are little bunny foo foo and she then played that she was little bunny foo foo and I could not talk to Karissa cause she was bonked on the head.  It was a silly conversation but good.    There were a couple of things that bothered me.  When we first started talking I asked her if she did anything fun today and she put the phone down and I did not hear anything except mommy he wants to know....   She then picked up the phone and said we went swimmming.  Well later in the conversation the same type of thing happened.  I think   SFW   has Karissa clearing what she can and cannot talk about with me.    I mean I will go to almost anything length to get incriminating information that will make   SFW   look bad but I will not involve my 4 year old daughter as a filter to do it.  Maybe I am reading that wrong but it still pisses me off if she is doing that
