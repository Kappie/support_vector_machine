The Ark of the Covenant, the chest the Hebrews used to carry around the Ten Commandments in...the original stone tablets that Moses brought down out of Mt. Heron and smashed, if you believe in that sort of thing...The Hebrews took the broken pieces and put them in the Ark. When they settled in Canaan, they put the Ark in a place called the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem, where it stayed for many years, until, all of a sudden, whoosh, it was gone.  (Gone?  Where?)  Nobody knows where.  Brody: However, an Egyptian pharaoh Shishak invaded the city of Jerusalem around about 980 BC and he may have taken the Ark back to the city of Tanis and hidden it in a secret chamber called the Well of Souls... However, about a year after the pharaoh had returned to Egypt, the city of Tanis was consumed by the desert in a sandstorm which lasted a whole year, wiped clean by the wrath of God....
