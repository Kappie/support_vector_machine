It was a great bilateral exercise.  Our RSM seemed to have scored some major points with Division. The performances and various other arrangements turned out exceptionally well. The food was nice too. There was a superb video clip which was made by my unit. There were more than a few requests for copies of the video. Even I feel like asking if I can keep a copy. But I didn't get to leave camp until about 10+pm.  Tomorrow, however, is gonna be a major cleaning up process. Think that's going to take a brigade effort.
