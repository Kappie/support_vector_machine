I rebooted, and just after I put in my password and hit enter, the hard drive made a nice loud ka-chunk noise and the system froze again. I hit reset, and boom, bye bye registry. I spent a few hrs working on it to try to get it going again. no luck.  Thursday night after class, I started reloading it, and had it pretty much done by the time I crawled off to bed around 12:40.  Was using the PC after work Friday, around 5:30..KA-CHUNK it goes again, and this time when I reboot, I get drive failure warnings.  Great....just dandy....and I hadn't made a ghost image of what I had done yet, as a backup.  So I started searching pricewatch.com for HD's. I thought something in the 120gig range would be nice. I found a Maxtor 120gig 7200 RPM hard drive, with 8megs of cache on it, for $87. I called up our local Staples, to see if they would still match the internet, plus shipping/sales tax. Nope, they stopped doing that.  So, I hop onto another PC and order it on-line, as I can limp along for the week on a 4gig drive that I had sitting around. The drive will ship monday and take 6-8 business days to get here.  I can't wait, as the hd I have in now is only a UDMA 2, not a 5 like the 40 was.  I want my speed back! But...I can wait, it'll be worth the wait.
