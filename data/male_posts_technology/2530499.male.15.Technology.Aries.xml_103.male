I mean, it's not all that hard, all those  faggot live journal users  competiting blog systems have comments, and everyone seems to do it, SO COMMENT THE FUCK UP, SLUTWHORES!  Just watched Broken Lizard's Club Dread. Funny fucking movie. Also, commented in some random chick's blog. Much coolness.  I stole this: Some people just don't get it  In my last entry, one commenter wrote that it's no big deal that random ID checks may be put in place in Boston. After all, what's the harm in showing ID to a friendly policeman who's only looking to protect us from the evildoers lurking about. We should worry about the "bigger stuff." But he misses the point. This IS the "bigger stuff". A nation doesn't become fascist or totalitarian overnight. It's a gradual process that is often welcomed by the country's population. "It can't happen here," they say. Well folks, it can and is happening here. And you of all people should understand what I'm talking about. To quote Ben Franklin, "Those who would sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither liberty nor security."   Stolen from:  urlLink This Is Not The Way Home , a great blog that you all should read, right now.
