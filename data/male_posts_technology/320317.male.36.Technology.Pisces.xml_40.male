Built on the MapPoint .NET Platform, MSN MapPoint expands Microsoft’s suite of popular mapping software and represents the beginning of MapPoint technology’s migration to Microsoft® .NET Web Services."   I heard on CNet radio that Microsoft really took a long look on how people really used map sites. Then again, they say that about every new product. However, the interesting thing is they designed the site by watching people's behavior, and how they were actually using the maps during and after printing them out... its all about users behaviors.
