This primarily because the people that tell me about the other browsers remind me of the Mac dorks that beat the Apple drum, or the Linux snobs.  Aaaaanywho, I started using Mozilla Firefox and I'm loving it.  It doesn't cost anything, and is *very* easy to download and set up (it can automagically inherit all of your Internet Explorer settings, for example).  There are a lot of cool things in it, like a built in pop-up blocker, but you can discover those on your own.  The reason that I'm bothering to tell you this is that I stumbled upon a feature that I haven't seen documented anywhere, and it's an excellent solution to the problem of knowing when this page is updated.  In Firefox, you can choose the properties of any of your Bookmarks (Favorites) to include a visual and/or auditory notification whenever that page is updated, with an option to automatically open that page.  I know for sure that I got a notification when King of Fools added her last post, and I think, but am not sure, that there is notification when someone adds a comment.  If anyone is interested, download from  urlLink here , where you can get a lot of information on the product as well.
