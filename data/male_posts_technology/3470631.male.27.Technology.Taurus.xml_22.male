The launching pad for the huge careers of Amanda Peet, Ivan Sergei, Jaime Pressly and that chick that was in What Women Want.   Am I a chick?  CHRIST  also -   Who's the Boss My Two Dads (where'd that chick go to after Step by Step?)  Perfect Strangers  Basically any show from TGIF - and God knows, I was home every Friday night during this time -- but hey maybe you were out sneaking beers and menthols in the Broomstone parking lot or getting date raped at the Red Roof Inn? I was busy watching Urkle try to win the girl, and busy watching Cory Matthews learn some very valuable lessons. Cherished time...
