This currently contains Web Links (also space for blogs..though not enabled yet).   The left sidebar now includes links from Amazon. I had worked on this to provide a rotating banner which will display best selling books, music and DVDs. (Though will add more categories to this latter).  And lastly the bottom of page has a "Donation" button for those who would want to contribute to my cause. (I had lot many things planned for this site and will share as and when i progress on this. I would love to have this blog content rich.)
