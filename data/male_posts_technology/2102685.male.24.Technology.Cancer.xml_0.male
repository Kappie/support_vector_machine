In the future I might upgrade from ASP to ASP.net, but for now I don't really have time to get into it all... Exams coming up really fast so, I'm just trying to hold on really!   Gotta start working on GDI+ and VB.NET as well tonite, I'll need it for my Advanced .Net exam... puh! Ah well, till next time!  Cheers!
