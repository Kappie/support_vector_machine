So I wrote this down, we read it together, and talked about it a little, then she kept the paper to read again if she wants.  I hope it helps her understand.     Nikki,    I wanted to tell you why I am sad or mad so much.  I am sick right now.  It is called depression.  I have had this disease since I was 8 or 9 years old.  I won’t die, or need to go to a hospital because of this disease.  Instead of making my body sick, it takes over my brain, my thoughts and feelings.  I call it “the beast”.  It is like I have two people in my body - the real me, and the beast.    The beast is in control of me a lot.  The beast makes me think and do mean things.  It makes me want to hurt myself and be alone.  It makes me want to run away sometimes.  It makes me not want love from anyone.    You did not do anything to cause me to be sick.  Please, please do not blame yourself.  You are not the cause of my hurt.  Remember I told you about the mean old woman who hurt me and my Mom?  This is all her fault.    The real “me” is the Dad that you like to talk to, and play games with.  The real me is in control when I am happy, laughing, and patient.  The real me loves you very much and wants you to grow up into a strong happy person.      I try every day to fight the beast inside my brain.  Sometimes I win, but often I lose.  I am trying very hard, I am seeing a doctor, I am taking medicine, and I am reading lots of books to learn how to fight the beast.    You can help me fight the beast.  You can help me by being kind and showing love.  You can help me by having respect for me and Mom, and listening when we tell you to do things.  You can help me by choosing to brush teeth and get ready for bed without being slow or ignoring me.  You can help by not fighting with Daniel.  I don’t need you to be sad for me, because that will not help me or you.      It always makes me feel better when you sit with me to talk about stuff, or to ask questions, or to just give hugs.    I know you are a good person, and I know you do not hate me, even when you get mad and say that.  Please always remember that I love you no matter what, and I will try very hard to control the beast.  I don’t want to do anything to make you sad.
