She got the same job description she got last year! And I got the job of a photographer  documentation ... I LOVE MY JOB!!! LOL :) That will be at the end of May.    Bon, I don't know kun ara na kamo ni ... pero ang church bala namon looking for pastors to train, so if ur interested I could ask the in-charged to send ur father an invitation. Maayo gid ni nga training cos after mo train sa clinic you can train sa own church nyo. Check na lang their site. :) And congrats (again for nth time already)! haha :) Love ur pictures, esp. ang yearbook! LOL :D Edmar, you're next! When's the exact date of your thesis defense? :) I really hope good ang result ng test tomorrow .... :)   I actually celebrated Graduation with the La Sallians tonight, because nag-eat kami sang Graduation buffet sa L'Fisher, pero wala kami ya graduate! haha :D Well, daw sending off na lang kay Mommy Ruth, the missionary staying with us, me American granny (hehe), cos she's leaving for the States na on Friday. :( Coming back on ... October, November or December ... depending kun san-o daw ma-finish ang war. She said she doesn't want to be a bait for terrorists sa amon family. Awww... but I got that info from her e-mails, ako daan ang encoder sang mga emails nya to her family. hehe   Gemsy, where are you? I miss your entries na gid! :) Ey, I bought new books sa PCBS this morning, I got " urlLink When God Writes Your Love Story " ... do u have this na, hmm... kung wala, pahulam ko gid dayon sa imo after I finish! hehe :)   So guys, where do you all plan to have your vacation this summer? :) Anyway, God bless you all. And have a good night! Jesus loves you! :) And yes, HAPPY 53rd CHURCH ANNIVERSARY TO BACOLOD TRINITY CHRISTIAN CHURCH! :) Praise the Lord for 53 years of His faithfulness and unending grace! :)
