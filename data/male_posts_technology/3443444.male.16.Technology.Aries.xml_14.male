More news is that the Original Trilogy will be out on DVD for the first time ever, in September, appearantly with some MORE edits, and added scenes and all that Lucas-y stuff. My god, I can't wait. Just a warning, if you see some Star Wars references in my blog for the next year and a half, its not my fault....        Anyhow, to all of my faithful readers that I'm unaware of, I haven't died, I've just been too lazy to update my blog, and have taken quite a bit of flak from Tyler, and a couple others because of it. Tyler, the bastard, just wouldn't leave me alone, calling me disgusting names because of my lack of work on this blog, I don't quite understand why he was so mean about it :(      Well, at 2:46 AM, I have nothing better to do, so I decided that I might as well....that, and the fact that Tyler had made several threats on my life if I didn't update it. but luckily, hes in Washington at a basketball camp, so I didn't have to worry about this until he gets back, which is soon.       The past week or two has been rather uneventful, although mine and Tyler's Mom has formed an evil allience to completely wipe out our poker extravaganzas. Appearantly, they think that me and Tyler are addicted to poker and think we should only play 2 times a month. And my Mom has incorperated the rule that I can't ride in anybody's car who hasn't had their license more than 6 months, and since I don't have my license, and usually my Mom is at work, my Dad is god knows where, and my brother has a girlfriend, somebody else is usually my only mode of transportation, unless I walk, but poker night is across town, so thats a negative on that. I must say that it is very stupid, and they just don't realize that playing poker is fun, and its something that I like to do, and it gets me out of the house, and away from this here computer, which happpens to be something that my Mom always complains about....    Well, thats all for now, I might have more to come later, most likely tomorrow, so keep and eye out....as much as that will hurt.
