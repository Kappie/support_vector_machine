I had to throw out some books and documents that i don't use any more and found my high school Diary the one we used to call  "ZIKHRONOT"  and some photos we took back then. It brought up some very nice and funny memories, my high school days was so fun, funny, cheerful days. I started reading the book and it cracked me up. Most of my class mate girls are now married, except for 3 or 4. Some lives in Nazareth and some went to the USA, Canada or the UK. I miss them all. They all started there essay with the following line: " To the dearest of all Nizoo the cute.. It is 2 am, 3 am... I love you... I'll miss you". Here are some of what i read and liked.  There was Soheir Awwad, a dear friend and a smart one also, who i used to copy my home work from here, specially the French lessons(god, I hate French). :) this is funny, we used to site together, open the French book and since it was hard for me to spell or pronounce the words correctly she used to read the article for me and i would write the words in Arabic in their exact pronunciation. She remind me of Miss Tmam. She called me the pain in the ass kid who had a little bit of manners, very smart and close to be a genius but a lazy one (she got that right) LOL, So sweet but a fool also (no fucking way). She wrote:"  i'll miss you a lot, who will copy the home works from me? Who will steal my pens? Who will trip us in the yard? Who will always say : I know this, I know that, I know?"  Saeed Awad. A weirdo! One of my best friends back then, we know meet occasionally.  He wrote me 2 lines!!   Amal Ghttas. She was smart and dear to me also. I liked these lines: "...By the way, i wish i had an older brother like you, sweet, cute and smart. I'll never find someone like you in the future. Who will call me home and play games on the phone and burp? Who will eat my lunch and steal my chocolates?..." "...This is an opportunity for me to wish you a Queen because you are real King and you deserve one. And live happily with her because she will with you."  Shadya Sroor. She wrote me 4 full pages, front and back!! "Do you remember the pens you used to steal from us???" why did they have to mention this? Sorry, I guess ;). I met Shadya a couple of months ago. She works in a beach in Tibirias with her sister and brother-in-law. I used to work their as a waiter. We shared some memories together. We associated in our last 2 years in high school and became very good friends. She wrote about the morning routine ".. The principal on the microphone... Move it, Yalla move it,.. Not again! Please god no... Make him someone else than Nizar Dirawi! You are late! Again! See you in my office..." She wrote some memories from the school trip to Taba.. It was a  Hell On Earth  for our teachers. LOL. I'll never forget it this one. Dancing in the Lobby, Singing duet with Saeed our song (we were the band that day), swimming together at night. I'll call her today, i miss her.  Shirin Danial and Wafaa Awad wrote me 5 pages, front and back. Me and Shirin used to fight a lot but we were also very close and she wrote a lot about it. She was very Hooooot. Wafaa once told me when we were at Maria's "I hate you", well.. me too. They wrote mainly silly stuff, and i couldn't read them, their hand write is sooo bad!!  Areen Rsheed. Never been close or friends. "... I'll remember you for your funny jokes.... The hilarious plays you wrote with Roni, and brought up in the class..."  Reem Abu Rajab wrote about the S.A.T (psychometric) course. I used to make fun of the trainers. I was much better than them.  One Bitch wanted my picture, naked, so she could remember me!!  Many many wrote in my book, I can't keep on writing here a brief of their essays. There was the unforgettable Mary Mazzawi we know each other ever since i remember myself, Raneen, Rozan and Joumana Nseer, Maria Mazzawi, Raneen Njar and many more. They are all my friends, more like brothers and sisters. I miss them all.
