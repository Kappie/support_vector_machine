Eh... the thing is... at the end of his speech, there was a time left for open question.  As a habit, my fellow Taiwan co-workers were all reluctant to ask anything ere forced by.  I had a couple rather good question in mind... but for some reason, I had not the courage to spit them out...  I can probably think of 10 execuses to that, but still, execuses are ... only execuses, they won't change the outcome.  It's not that I want to show off or anything, but somehow I feel regretful and uneasy for not have the guts to stand up.  Just... stand up...
