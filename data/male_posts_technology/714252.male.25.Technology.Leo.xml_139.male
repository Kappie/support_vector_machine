Not going to give a blow by blow of the weekend and week so far, just the highlights  Had a Great pissup after my last day of work, was great fun when I got to Rí-Rá because I hadn't been there in ages and a mate I hadn't seen in even longer was "on the decks" so I basically got to hear whatever I wanted all night.. Suddenly it became a hip-hop night! Woohoo!  Then I recovered nicely on Sat morning and had lunch with my GF and my mother dearest and a trip to see XXX. (It does EXACTLY what it says on the tin so I was a happy camper.. I also got to see the trailer for Twin Towers (The LOTR version) and the next bond movie.. I was Very happy at that point so the movie really was a bonus) After that it was home, change back into town to meet Karl for a drink or two before the others got in (we congratulated ourselves on our new found freedom!). Shelly and Tasha turned up next (Rarrrrr) closely followed by Bubbs and eventually all the others (read bubbles blog for a list, I'm lazy)  Me and bubbs did our funkay thing and had a good laugh, got to touch gordon boobies briefly (I am trying to cut down now, i swear!)  Don't REALLY remember a lot after 4 Dame to be honest (I do know what the stick is about though.. Wouldn't shelly like to know ;P)  Sunday was good, was one of the few that forced themselves to make the first class in the pouring rain (mostly because I was supposed to talk to Josh about some web-site stuff and then he never turns up! GAH!) but had an ok class anyway.  Monday was first day of work.. I was kinda flakey to be honest (probably stil recovering frmo Sat) but we got a LOT done. Tuesday was Audition and movies day.. Everyone else will have a little rant about it anyway so I am going to just say HEHEHE it was FUN! Then lastnight at salsa I got over my not dancing thing... Maybe the whiskey helped a little but it was still good damnit!  K, off to do some more "work"
