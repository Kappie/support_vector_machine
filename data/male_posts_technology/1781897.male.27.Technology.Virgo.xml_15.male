These are the days from which greatness can arise, and yes my friends....in the UK, the time of the super hero, is nigh!   urlLink This guy  happens to be a true-blue, brass-balled, spandex-lovin, monster garage watchin, beer drinkin dood with a big fucken Angle-Grinder (for those who don't watch monster garage, that is a saw that cuts through metal).  Any way, despite bad teeth and shitty weather, this guy would make livin in London.....tolerable!  I want a cape too!
