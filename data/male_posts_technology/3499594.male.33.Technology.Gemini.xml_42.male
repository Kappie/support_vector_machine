The next thing I know it's 4:30. I turned everything off and finally tried to sleep.  I was awaken this morning with the housekeeper trying to come through the door. Fortunately, it was locked on the inside. I got up, showered, ate and called my beloved  wife to check on her. She had 3 dogs, 2 kids sleep with her last night. So no rest for the wicked or insane.    100 days till election? The only thing on the news is the big party at the Democratic Convention happening in Boston and the missing Hacking woman. I think I have a resolution for both accounts. I say we acquire our suspects, crank them up with truth serum in a public forum ( this would allow all to see and keep questions to the topic ) and start out with the questioning. This would keep cost down and we would get to the bottom of the real deal.  Now for the politicians, we get both candidates in the same forum, crank them up and ask them the important questions. Each candidate would be able to answer honestly and soundly. Being the skeptic in me, I realize this is not full proof, due to those extremist finding means to reduce the effect of the truth serum, but we can work out that bug.  Also yesterday, I was speaking with a lady at the Fort Smith airport. She was returning to New York. I don't know how the conversation ended up on smokes (no I don't smoke) but she said a pack of cigerattes cost 6.50 to 7 bucks per pack. I responded "Are you serious?" Talk about mindboggling. I don't know how much a pack is in my area, 3.50 - 4 ? But, it is tremendously less here than in NY. I asked her how many did she buy to take back. She bought 4 cartons. Seems for about 60 bucks a carton up there runs around 22 here. Great Scott, I would have someone just mail them to me. My mind couldn't help thinking that would be a good little black market. Think  about it, goto an indian smoke shop for non-tax smokes and mail them to someone up there. It would still be cheaper for them. So anyone in NY or another state reading this can contact me to work out the details.   I gotta do some work, but I don't want too.
