I was just in his wedding, and had the opportunity to spend some time with him.  Actually have a bit of a funny story.  The groom's men and groom are getting ready for the wedding.  Now, when you're gettin ready to put on a tux...even if you're not usually Mr. Style...you expect that you'll look pretty good.  So, we're getting all dicked up...and as i'm puttin on my tux...i'm thinking...shit....have i gained like 50 lbs in the last month or something?????  This fucken tux wouldn't fit a 12 year old.  The sleeves came half way down my arm, and the pants were so short...you could see half way up my calf!  Barry and Peterson are laughing at me because i look like a total tool!  When i try to get the shoes on....they're size 9!  Now, I wear size 14...therez now friggen way i'm getting into those shoes!  So, I'm stressin out...wanting to not goto the wedding...and not be up in front of a crowd in a tux made for a kid.  Barry gets to thinking and realizes that his dad wears size 9.  Maybe they switch tuxes!!!  We get to the country club where the transaction (wedding) is supposed to go down.  I'm wearing my dope ass tiny tux as I wait for Barry's dad to get there with what I hoped would be mine.  When Barry's dad got there...he did in fact have my tux (whew..i'll be in the wedding after all) and we proceed to the nearest men's room.  So there i'm standing with Barry's dad...we're both in black sox and boxer shorts shooting the shit while we switch tuxes...was totally funny...fancy place with 2 naked doods hanging out by the shoe polisher in the men's room.  This was the first time I had a chance to hang out with Harry Brinkerhof Doyle III one on one.  We spoke about life...watching his kids grow up and the like.  He expressed how excited he was to see Barry get hitched, and how proud he was of him.  He was a cool guy, and now more than ever, i cherish the opportunity to stand naked and shoot the shit with him.  Life is so fragile...sometimes...when you think of how fragile and temporary it is...you almost fear reaching out and living it.
