 I admit I was thoroughly confused about XSL, XSLT, XPath, CSS, XHTML, and XML when it first came out. What is really important to understand is XSL (same as XSLT) takes XML and "Transforms" it into the user interface XHTML (HTML). That's it basically, so don't try to over analyze all the acronyms.
