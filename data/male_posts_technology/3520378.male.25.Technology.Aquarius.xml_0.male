It was a night that included a very fast and efficient waitress (strangley hot as well).  It continued with equal parts of vodka and tonic in massive quantities.  Drunken conversations about politics, college, the future, and............hmmm, probably other stuff that was highly emotional and without much intelligence.  Good times!  Meandered home at about 430 after stops at the Dark Horse and Seiwerts.  Saturday night got Sushi and a slew of other expensive Japanese quisine at some place on Southport, then onto Irish Oak's with Fugazy and Dibona.  A nice chill evening overall.  Gosh, this weekend was more or less uneventful.  No dumb stories, no crazy stories, just your run of the mill weekend nights.  Oh well, they can't all be trips to the moon.
