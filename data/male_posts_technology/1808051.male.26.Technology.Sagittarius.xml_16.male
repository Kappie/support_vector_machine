It is always dumb stuff to "My screen says non-system disk error, what do I do?" "Uh, dumb ass eject the floppy and hit any key to continue, that will be $39.99, Thank you for calling. DOne At Home!"  And the other great thing about to day is that it rained and flooded C.S,but isn't it great when it rains you can just sleep 'til 1:30 and have no worries in the world.  Oh even better news Wendy got a job back on Capital Hill so she will be back making no money, but doing something that she really likes. I have never been happier for her.  Well enough for now time to do laundry and finish the big clean.  -smipf
