Either it will make you mad at what they are implying, or it will make you mad that our 'discipleship' in the American church ends when it comes to money.  In either case, it is compelling evidence. If giving in American churches went up to 10%, there would be an additional $86B for missions.  Note what the chart says that number can do around the world.    In regards to our summer missions stuff: 2 trips raising support total needed = $9450 total to date = $4201 # of weeks spent raising support so far = 4 I'm not writing this to boast at all, mostly I'm just trying to get it straight in my head.  But I also think that when people hear about the need, not just financially, and they see the opportunity to partner with our mission efforts, money is just a detail.
