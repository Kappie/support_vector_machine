"I'm very concerned that, in our desire for security and our enthusiasm for pursuing supposedly terrorists, that sometimes we might be on the verge of giving up the freedoms which we're trying to protect."   [ urlLink Source ]  Hm, ya think?  I thought the people we elected were supposed to think about more than just today.  Like how decisions made today will effect "tomorrow."  Silly me.
