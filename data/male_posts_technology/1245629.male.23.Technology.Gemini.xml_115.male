When Earth is ruled by master-machines... when robots are more human than humankind.    urlLink Dr.Susan Calvin .

Three Laws of Robotics      A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
