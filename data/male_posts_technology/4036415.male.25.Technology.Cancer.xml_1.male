Then like an epidemic, one by one I see my friends 'enlightened' to join this bloggers' community. I can't help feeling puzzled - what in the name of Satan is thismystical power that draws everybody in? It's not as if we might eventually gain something out ofscribbling a few purposeless words, is it? The thing that surprises me most is - those friends who join this community actually stay in the community. Blogs after blogs they post, throwing my initial impression of a temporary hype thingy straight into the recycle bin on my desktop.   Well, perhaps it's time for me to fall victim to this new age religion. If you can't fight them, join them. After all, that's the best way to understand what's in it. So fellow blogvirus-infected dudes, prepare your armor! Draw your sword! Raise your shield! For I am charging at your direction.  (LOTR??)   I know it is hard to imagine someone as dull as myself to publish a blog site. To tell you the truth I suspect this may well be the last blog that I ever post. Meantime, while I am trapped in my workplace, glued to my pathetic little semi-comfortable chair  (When the h*** am I going to get that nice leatherish-looking director chair in that glossy room around the corner?) , feeling extremely bored,  (by bored, i refer to my refusal to do the work that I am supposed to do, maybe that's why I am out here instead of being in that glossy room)  maybe this is the only less boring thing for me to do.   What a lovely Monday evening ...
