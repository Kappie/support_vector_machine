Cassini has also seen 'a striking glow emanating day and night from the planet's largest moon, Titan.' A moon that shines with unborrowed light!"    "CNN is running  urlLink a story  about how ours might be a unique solar system. Of the 100+ systems currently known to contain planets, all contain seemingly only gas giants. However, this may be a case of  urlLink current technology and techniques  being unable to detect planets similar to Earth."   There are also   urlLink BBC  and  urlLink Space.com  stories.
