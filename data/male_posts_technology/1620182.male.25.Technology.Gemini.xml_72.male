Is it better to try to do your best at all times, or is there benefit to letting someone else succeed and then reap their rewards?   urlLink Nonzero  talks about east versus west in the  urlLink industrial revolution .  Why didn't the industrial revolution start in the China instead of England and France?  Euro-centrist theory says that Europe was either better suited for the revolution due to proximity to resources (not really) or it was lucky (almost).  Interestingly, history shows us that China came very, very close to an industrial revolution.  Much earlier than Europe, in fact.  But they never made the leap into industrialization.  Why?  
 
 At the time, China was the place to be.  Europe was in second place.  China was developing technologies and their economy was booming (by their standards).  This naturally drew attention to them -- bad attention in the way of barbarian hordes who rampaged through the country, eventually subjugating them.  After 100 years of barbarian rule, the Chinese broke free, thus starting the Ming dynasty.
 
 During the Ming dynasty, things changed for China.  They still had an imposing economy, but they changed their policies.  With barbarian rule fresh in their minds and still under threat of invasion, the Chinese stopped sea-born exploration.  They severely clamped down on free trade with foreign countries, banning many foreign goods.  Essentially, they developed a very isolationist policy -- investments in  urlLink the Great Wall  being a prime symbol.  The result?  The lack of free trade and internalized policy stagnated Chinese progress.  England and France developed the steam engine, and the rest is history.  
 
 But what can we learn from this?  First, it sucks to be the leader.  Whether you're a rich businessman, a sports team, or the world's most powerful nation, people, organizations, and countries are going to be gunning for you.  You are the number one target.  How do you stay on top?   urlLink Speak softly and carry a big stick , but don't isolate yourself.  Instinctively, people try to prevent the sniping from tearing them down.  Isolationism leads to the decay of idealism.  And if you can't take the heat, then maybe there's something to be said for second place.  Maybe.
