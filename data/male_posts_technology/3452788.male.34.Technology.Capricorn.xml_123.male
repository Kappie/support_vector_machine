The Media force-feeds us tragedies of rich white people across the country as if the problems of the elite in their gated communities somehow relate to the rest of us who live or work or die in an imperfect, unmanicured, chaotic world.  In the past year, the TV networks have tripped over themselves and each other to see who could most dramatically portray the terrible stories of the upper crust: the kidnapping of a girl from a rich Mormon family living in Utah, or the divorce of 2 rich white people in Miami, or the custody battle over traumatized children resulting from an affair between rich white people in Manhattan.  Granted, the Laci Peterson case in Modesto does not involve rich people, but they sure are white.  I am willing to bet there have been several suspicious deaths of black or Hispanic victims in the Modesto area in the 18 months since that story appeared.   Why is it that the harsh realities of the lower middle class of varied ethnicity who work one or more jobs every day do not get the same media attention?  For every “high-profile” case that makes it on Dateline or Court TV or 20-20 or all the other shows, there are dozens of similar cases with equally terrible crimes, equally devastated families, and similar legal issues.  Are the crime victims of Oakland and Modesto and Eureka and a thousand other cities and towns not as important as the victims of the Hamptons or Aspen or Beverly Hills?  Does the skin color of the deceased make a murder more or less mysterious or appalling or final?  Is the perpetrator more or less guilty based on the number of zeros on the victims paycheck?  I blame The Media, which seems every day closer to becoming a group of public relations firms, intent on keeping their bosses/clients/supporters in the news every day, no matter what.  The rich corporations and rich individuals who own The Media need to look in the mirror and see their own kind.  The TV becomes that mirror, showing a homogeneous, white and green reflection that is the opposite of the diversity in culture and financial status that accurately reflects our country.  The only time that the media is truly interested in the hardships of minorities or the poor is when they are celebrities (OJ Simpson, who transcended race because of his athletic prowess, comes to mind) or when it directly affects those in power (visible homeless populations are unattractive to a city making a bid for the Olympics, for example).  The network news shows are the worst, but it happens in every media outlet from Peoria to Portland to New York City.  The media took a break from rich people during the aftermath of the 9-11 attacks; that coverage was somewhat sensitive the first few days but quickly degenerated into a race to see which network could find the most heart-wrenching and tragic and ironic story.  In addition, there are people in the media who look for stories that affect families and neighborhoods and communities where normal people live.  In those instances, the resolution of the story and the effect, positive or negative, is just as important as the crime itself.  In particular, I think the America’s Most Wanted show is honestly about solving crimes and bringing justice to all people, no matter what their socioeconomic background.  This is not a blind rant against every white person with lots of money.  I would like to be in that same position some day, and it is not for me to judge how a person earned (or was handed) their wealth.  If I am fortunate enough to earn stacks of money, I hope that I do not suddenly think that my problems outweigh those of my neighbors.  In addition, I certainly do not mean to suggest that the victims of violence or disaster deserve their fate or do not deserve any sympathy.  Death and fear and greed and hate and Mother Nature are still truly and painfully colorblind.  This diatribe is pointed more toward the idea that some persons are more important than others, their hardships are more significant, or their losses any more painful because of their circumstances of wealth or race.  Everybody deserves to have safe homes, safe children, well-built schools, adequate protection from the scourge of drugs.  Everybody deserves to feel like something positive can come from hardship or tragedy.  But please do not feed me the idea that the problems of the upper crust are a fair representation of the problems facing the rest of us.    Am I wrong?  Am I too critical?  Let me know what you think.
