I still have to put in the main drain, shouldnt be but few hours for that early in the am. then its cement time. if i get all the cement in tomorrow, I will install the liner sunday and start filling with water.  that looks doubtful, as i still have some electrical to run. Might have to put the liner in next saturday. probably will plan on that but we will see. I have plenty to do even with liner out so wont rush things.
