I'm running out of people I know who are aware of what Gmail is and actually want an account.  So... I figure I'll put them up here as a bonus to anyone who reads my blog. The first 5 people to reply in the comments section to this post will get the invite.  PS. I receive email notification when a comment is submitted so please be patient because I'll be sending the invite along as soon as I can.
