It has some pretty big flaws but it's okay and I'm surprised by how many people are on it. Loren's even on it.  It would make more sense for me to have my blog there because more people can see it and are more likely to comment but I like this thing damn it and I'm sticking to it.  view my myspace profile  urlLink http://profiles.myspace.com/users/5841707    recent listening: Neko Case - Blacklisted Pinback - Blue Screen Life The Decemberists - Her Majesty...
