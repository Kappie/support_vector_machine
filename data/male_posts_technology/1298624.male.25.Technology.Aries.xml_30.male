The only bad thing is I won't see you, Edgar :( BUT, I will be back by 4pm so maybe you can have dinner with the family :) Can you eat my dad's famous Ravioli? Doesn't that sounds good?   The day off....Hmmm.... Not that I will be relaxing. I have to take Meryl to SB to her new apartment and schlepp some of her belongings. I hope the weather is nice there. I am sure it will be better than here. It is so hot, muggy and humid.
