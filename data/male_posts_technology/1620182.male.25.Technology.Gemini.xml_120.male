 Next month, I will aptly gaze upon a photo of the  urlLink Shenandoah National Park .  I say it is apt because on August 2, 2004, Herndon, VA will become my new home office.  I'm moving to VA!  And not just for the weekend!  I think I'll still be traveling between VA and NY a lot, but it will be by plane from now on.  Soon I will have broadband service at home, I'll be able to reduce rate I'm putting miles on my car, and I'll be able to visit my parents more than twice a year.  This is exciting...
