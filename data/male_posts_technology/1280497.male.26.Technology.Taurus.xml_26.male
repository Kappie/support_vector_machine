Instead of the nice bed, the nice eyes closed, the nice Julie right next to me, I have Radiohead (not a bad thing, by any means), a microwave chimichanga, and a mostly-empty (now) can of Coke. Tough trade.  Certain things set me into a mode where I feel like writing, and one of them is to read other peoples' blogs. It's not as though I find all of them inspiring, but I guess the knowlege that there are thousands, perhaps millions, of people writing their thoughts down, making connections, bragging about their summer jobs--makes me want to put my laziness on the shelf and start plunking away on the ol' keyboard. There are no excuses left for me when there are about 1 billion blogs written by every type of person imaginable.  But spending the next hour and a half in this computer chair, wishing I could be home, isn't how I originally envisioned this night. I really didn't envision anything about this night. I block out this time most nights for our good friend Mr. Sleep. But gosh, why is it that I have to be dead tired, back up against a wall time-wise, before I'll sit down and write a little? I just hope I can be a writer, and that it won't mean that I'm always tired, always wishing I was doing something else, and eating terrible microwave food and gut-disintegrating sodas!   It's funny to mention this blog to people. It's just me, and so it's not as though there can be any other motive for telling someone than that you want them to read what you have to say. It's odd. I mean, I would never email this type of stuff to other people, but I'll tell folks to check out my deep, inner thoughts on this site.  I have to go to another paragraph so that I won't keep talking about blogging. Meta blogging, that's not what I'm trying to do here. Writing is an interesting thing (here I go on a meta-writing binge--someone help me) because one can write about writing. I guess you can talk about talking, but what else can have that circular quality? You can't firefight about firefighting, can you? Cook about cooking? Run about running? Eat about eating? You can read about reading. There's one. I'll stop now, while I've only half-lost your attention.  So Grandma Bergeson's funeral is tomorrow. She is Mom's mom, the grandmother whom I never really knew that well, who shopped at the discount stores, who sent us two dollar bills for Christmas and clothes with the thrift shop sale price tag still attached. She's the grandma who taught me about U.S. Savings bonds by sending one on our birthdays, who made tapes for Mom and Dad telling about the latest weather in Portland, Oregon.   She was a person who seems to have been shaped by the times in which she lived. She and Grandpa lived through the depression, and so she was always saving money, making sure she wouldn't go broke. And they didn't, but even up until the end of her life, when she was in the assisted-care place here in Utah, she showed signs of that still being a concern. She wasn't thinking completely clearly, but I thought it was telling that she mentioned that her "boyfriend" in the care center was a millionaire. He probably wasn't anything of the sort, and he died shortly thereafter anyway, but the point is, some part of her was still saying "You are in danger of losing it all!" even up to the very end of her life. I don't know if that's bad, or if it's good, or what. I just know that it's a different approach from the way 99% of America lives---without saving a penny for a rainy day, or even worse, going into huge amounts of debt to buy things that they shouldn't.
