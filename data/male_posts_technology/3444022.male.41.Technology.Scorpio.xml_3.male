Later on the playground she grabbed my sunglasses and said 'ochki' - which was the first time I heard it.  She's repeating a lot of words now, although most of them are either semi-right sounding or completely different (for example star is still referred to as 'tash' and diamond as 'dash').  The big news of the day was that we picked a kindergarten for Rita and she'll be starting in a week, a week after her 22 months birthday.  It's a necessary step, since with Ben coming onboard - we just won't be able to manage effectively otherwise, but I feel sad to let her go and not see her when I come downstairs any time.  When we stopped by the place yesterday, she even played a little bit with the kids, without any problems, danced to the music that was playing, quickly becoming one of the kids, which was great to see, considering nightmarish kindergarten experience I had when I was little.  I hope she'll adjust quickly and like it there... I sincerely hope she does.
