 I had a small slice of meatloaf.  It isnt too spicy, but maybe more than what I usually eat.  It was only one slice so I thought it might be ok, and so far it is.  I'm drinking water in gulps with the meatloaf (almost a requirement) so there is mild belching. 

 The real reason for the post is that I've had two waves of pain in my stomach.  Pretty mild, and it has been only the two.  Still, I wanted to write it down. 

 I'm still hungry.  That walk did me good I think.  I'm going to eat more, but I'm going to try to wait a little bit.  On the other hand, I don't want to eat to close to training tonight. 

 Update: I just ate a pear, all at once, and I already know it was a bad idea.  The gurgling is hitting fast, low in the abdomen, and the belching is already here. The pear seemed a little acidic so I wonder if that is the cause.
