See kids...this is what eating crap food does for you...makes u stupid and uncreative.  Maybe a bowl of branflakes will help...  I often wonder how some people get their jobs.  You get these guys in the sales world who's only method of selling stuff is to dump the price below cost...seems like a pretty sad way to do business to me.  I mean...I guess if you can look in the mirror and be ok with yourself having no skillz at all in your job, well then good on you.  Me, I need to feel good about what I do.  Damn integrity... life would be a heck of a lot easier if I just didn't give a shit; if people could be like tools to me and I could use them for my ends and not worry two squirts about whether or not their interests are being looked after as well.    Then there are the people who do fuck all except write a good report and make a good presentation to the boss.  I get these reps all the time who don't know shit, rarely show up, and never tell me anything to help me sell their product.  Now I was a rep for a long time, and a damn good one at that.  I never kissed the bosses ass or played the politics game, but my customers loved me and learned from me and developed huge loyalty to the product I sold.  And it got me laid off.  The guy who took over my position has never been seen by my former customers... go figure.  Nice to know that slackery will get you everywhere.  Having said all that, in the end of it all I know that I will come out ahead of these tools, if not financially at least when the balance sheet is measured at the end of it all.  Which may be sooner rather than later with Nikita Bush and Adolf Rumsfeld in charge of the US of A.  But that's a whole 'nother blogg...
