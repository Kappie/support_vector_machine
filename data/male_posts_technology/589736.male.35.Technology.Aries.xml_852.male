I am very surprised at your list of movies Johnathan.  From discussing movies with over the past couple of years, my previous post is what I thought I knew of your movie preferences.  Obviously I was just a *little* off in my understanding.  There is only one movie on the list that I have not seen (Purple Rain) and only one I don't care for (The Karate Kid - he makes Luke Skywalker seem like a mature adult).  I guess we have more similar taste than I realized.  My apologies.  Angie - Boys are gross.
