Yes I am now a part of US based  HTC Global Services Inc.  in its Global Development Centre, here in MEPZ, Chennai. Joined today as a Technical Communicator...  There is a long and interesting story in my past one month's life. Yes! It was a situation when my company (Vannet Techloggix) went bankrupt and one fine morning I (not only for me but to all my colleagues too) got a notice from my company that the operations are going to be closed by Feb 15th...  I was left stranded and till feb 13th I did not have any other options at hand. But on 15th morning.... I submitted my papers and got the relieving order and in the same evening I got the offer letter from HTC.  Yep!!!!! I did not believe it at the first place, but its true...ha ha...somewhere I should have done some good at some time in my life...and finally everything was sorted out and I joined HTC after all joining formalities have been completed...   I am now in my induction program and will be kicked off with the project in another couple of days. Thats it.  And one more news. Hope some of you might be knowing that Sandil is here in chennai. Now he is working as the Distribution Manager at Grandix Pharmaceuticals and has rented a house near CMBT. We are used to meet once in two days atleast and we enjoy riding the roads of chennai...  And I am also expecting one more good news, which I know but waiting for that person to tell u all and take that pleasure himself...everything well and good. And yes...This is why I was not able to participate in the blog for the past couple of weeks as I was preoccupied with hell a lot of things...  Ok then, bye bye and take care friends. Mahendran Jayavel.  Note: Jax can you give a call to me at this number: 044-55384745. Its urgent and make the call without fail tomorrow after 9'o clock in the night tomorrow. I have a message for u.
