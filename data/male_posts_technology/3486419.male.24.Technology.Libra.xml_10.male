SO retro, that i almost dance "Square Room" and with complimentary hand signs. Oh huh oh oh.. square roooom...." and then i will sing,   "Oh my love, it’s you and that I dream of   Oh my love, since that day   Somewhere in my heart I’m always   Dancing with you in the summer rain"  But after that i will get evicted, even before i can get my ass planted and whip out my student card. So i decided to ass myself down quietly.Paper wasn't that bad. Hope can score well. Went to eat dinner with Cynthia before heading back. Counted: 17 days to go before my academic life ends.  I do have to apologies for my bad contents, coz its exam season, so not much inspirations, coz i m mugging all the while. I promise more juicy contents after exams lah. Muahahuahuahua.  Ok. got to get backt to MSN.
