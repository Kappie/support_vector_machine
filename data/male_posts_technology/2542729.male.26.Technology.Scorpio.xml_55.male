We laughed, we joked. She was here and we were happy! We were having fun! Apparently defying the odds seeing as tho she stayed here over night. It all felt so real and so meant to be! Was it meant to be? Why couldn't it all just be beautiful and then there would be life? Two persons swimming thru the intangibles of a life flawed, together. Two persons dealing with the stain of loss while holding out waiting on a change to come. Two persons rebelling against a system of pagan economics, dealing with and dealing blows to. And so as not to confuse, I speak of her who was once regarded so highly, whose name resounded throughout the heavens and illuminated an army of dark hearts. I speak of her to whose destiny mine was so inclusively linked...  I also speak of she of whom nothing could have been farther from the truth, whose resolve rested on the shoulders of a man that never stood a chance of giving her what she really needed, but kept trying. Relying on a blind faith in an intuition that spoke words clear as daylight. This thing that I divorced, and didn't look back upon, it has come to me in a dream. Perhaps it was meant to be closure...a lasting vision to quell the bitter taste of a bitter breakup. All I know for certain is,  I had a dream
