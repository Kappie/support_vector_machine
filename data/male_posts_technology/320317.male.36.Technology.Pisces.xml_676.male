Instead of devoting two-thirds of the site to a dizzying, animated ad, Macromedia should follow the examples of  urlLink The New York Times ,  urlLink Lands' End  and  urlLink United Airlines . Their home pages use no-nonsense, multicolumn layouts that immediately dish up key content and function. By showing off the flashier features of Flash instead of using the technology to deliver value, Macromedia plays into the hand of its critics."

 Looks like all the people who dislike bad uses of Flash design are coming out the woodwork ever since Macromedia released their   urlLink new "Flash heavy" site . Like the " urlLink Flash: 99% Bad " article before it from usability guru Jakob Nielsen, this has to be upsetting to the "Flash-is-the-answer-to-everything" community. From their point of view, they probably can't understand how a boring black and white design (NY Times) could possibly be more useful than the new Flash intensive Macromedia.com. All they typically tend to care about is how does a site look, rather than how useful it is to the user.
