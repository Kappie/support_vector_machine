I bought an iBook a few years ago, in 2001, because they were cheap and Unix, and was pretty happy with it - so much so that I bought another at the start of this year. It's been part of move away from the geeky function-over-form towards the whole experience thing. I bought an iPod recently, too, and like that, too.  However, I haven't been a cordial-drinker. I don't stay up late at nights to watch Steve Jobs' keynotes, and don't buy the latest product as soon as they come out.  In fact, the first keynote I've watched any of was just yesterday, from WWDC, and that only just to get a better idea of the scale of a 30" LCD monitor. And, I have to say, I was pretty bloody impressed. There were, I guess, 7 things:    big new LCD screens: I thought the old apple LCDs were beautiful, but beyond my price range. The new ones are the still beyond my price range, but bigger and more beautiful.   spotlight, meta-driven local searching: Some MS blogs have been talking about this in WinFS, and Jobs' demo was sure impressive, and looked like something I could actually use.   RSS integration into Safari: Not a big deal, really, I don't think, but nice.   core image/core video libraries: This is some impressive stuff, and I would have thought would make Photoshop Mac's life at once easier and more difficult.   dashboard, (aka konfabulator): Cute, not sure how useful.   visual scripting (Automater): Again, cute, but not sure how useful.   iChat multi-point, new codec: This is some serious eye candy. If any of my family in Australia had a mac, I'd probably give a try. Don't know what the bandwidth requirements are like, though.    Some of the really impressive stuff, for me, is in the core image, dashboard, and iChat stuff, and the way they use on-board graphics functions to just make stuff look cool. Once upon a time I would have written it off as just eye-candy, but more and more I'm of the opinion that quality of user interaction is at least as important as underlying architectural elegance. Although I say "cute, unsure how useful" a lot, I said the same thing about expos√©, and now find it pretty useful.
