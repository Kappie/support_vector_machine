I am going to keep this here prime piece of cyberspace delight more in the form of a bulletin board less the thumbtacks and annoying holes that they leave behind.  I'll primarily post articles, quotes, lyrics and other things unsaid by me that both tickle my fancy and better yet pertain to the life I see around me. That’s what I did last night with the Civil War piece. I also have a sinful fetish for all those completely baseless quizzes that seem to populate the web faster than rabbits in a cage and I equally I like daily memes so I'll probably do a number of each.   Entries directly related to me personally will be rare if at all so if you're looking for a voyeur or confessor please pass on. Anyone remaining I invite to take Shel’s advice and stay with me awhile.
