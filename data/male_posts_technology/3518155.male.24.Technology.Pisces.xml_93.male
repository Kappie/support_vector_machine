Now, I did not intend to purchase a  combo  product when I stepped into the store. I was, instead, planning on acquiring a regular inkjet printer, the  urlLink Canon i560 . Scanners were to be evaluated, not bought. However, one-phone-call-to-Apu later, I found myself busy testing a line of multi-function printers (He insisted that they are a safe buy, especially the HP variety; and provided happy customer testimonials).  The evaluation process was simple; Rachel had brought along with her a test sheet of paper on which she had scribbled a few color pencil sketches (the point of the scanner is so we can digitize the little cartoons she produces on occasion). Since none of the printers were hooked up to an actual PC, we simply used the copier function to produce color copies of the test sketch, and thus test the scanner at the same time.   Canon machines produced crap, strangely enough, and were out of contention immediately. The HP 2175 did a reasonable job reproducing the sketch. The  urlLink Epson Stylus CX5400  generated a very crisp copy. Rachel figured that the printers could be tweaked to print finer copies, and so we redid the settings on all printers. And this time, the HP printer performed the best. A quick check on cartridge prices, and the winner was clear.  I'm still wondering about how long before one of the  functions  in this multi-function wonder breaks down, bringing down the rest of it with it. We'll wait and see.  First, I need to get a frigging USB connection cable. These b*stards at HP left it out of the package for some mysterious reason (is listed as an  optional accessory , which it most certainly is NOT). Makes me wonder why they even bothered to provide cartridges.
