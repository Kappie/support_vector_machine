The only person left outside was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flowerbed outside number four.  Thus starts  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , by J.K. Rowling, the fifth in the bestselling series of Harry Potter Novels.  I just pre-ordered my copy at  urlLink Fabmall .  yayyyy !!
