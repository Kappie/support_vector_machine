Well, their just going to have to wait, or leave a VM.  Finished hearing Edwards speech. I figured he would be articulate being a lawyer. I found it interesting his 'hey, were not being hate-mongers, but you just wait to hear the attacks on us'. Gee, must had missed all the retorts from the liberal Senator's. He must had missed out on all those attacks this year, and the many conversations of no more bush bashing in this DNC. He sounds clueless to me. I also noted he said basically word by word, "we will hunt down AlQueda and kill them" as Bush had been promising from  9-11 till present, and he has been doing so throughout. Basically, I heard him saying we will be one america not a racial america. Not that the black americans are far better off during this adminstration than any in the past. But that's just the facts.   I may seem bias, but I have to say. I dont like all that Bush is doing, but the main question that should be on everyones mind is, which candidate would be best to serve us during this war. Personally, I think it will be Bush. I will say again. The ideology of trying to bring in our so-called allies back to our way of thinking, helping us, ect. just doesn't jive. Trust me people, the fence is being dismantled and side-straddling is no long an option. Everyone needs to make a choice and those like France, Germany, ect. has already made their choice of not being our allies.
