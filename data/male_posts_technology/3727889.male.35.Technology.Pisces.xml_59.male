I was reading the Texas Holdem book listed in my book section by Brad Daugherty and Tom McEnvoy, and read the part about short stack. I really like anything Tom McEnvoy writes. He has a simple way of explaining things that is good for starting out. I have usually tried to "Stay in the game" when I become short stack. The book suggests this is incorrect play. The adjustment it says I should make is if I am in critical stack position if I am going to bet, I should just go all in. Here is a portion of the chart:   Round       Move In Stack 1           50 2           100 3           150 4           250 5           500 6           750   I could go on. The only point I am making here is that when you have that few chips and the blinds are a decent size you MUST risk it all to have a chance to win it all. I played 5 tourneys today to test this. I placed in 4 of 5. Two of these I would have been blinded out or made little money if I did not go all in with a good yet move in stack left. I doubled and tripled up in a tourney this way from a $450 stack at 5th level with six people left! I ended up in second place. Not bad. Normally I would have made small bets and maybe made a little money. So all of NL tourney guys out there be prepared to GO .. ALL .. IN!
