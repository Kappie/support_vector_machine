It is like saying guys that are attracted to extremely obese women are morally wrong and we should make a constitutional amendment against such practice.  "Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth a nation that will not all the procreation of fat people."  My whole family would be screwed.  Or rather we wouldn't be screwed.  Depending on how you look at it.
