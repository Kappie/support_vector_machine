       
      One of my projects that I forgot to mention was genealogy.  I have been working on my family history on and off for about 15 years.  I haven't done anything with it for about 5 years now, which is why it slipped my mind.  But, I may catch the bug again.  Or I may get a call from some distant cousin that I didn't know I had.  So I will add this to my list of works.  Now, getting back to those Egyptians...
