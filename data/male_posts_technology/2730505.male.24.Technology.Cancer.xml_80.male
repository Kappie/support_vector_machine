I wanted to go visit the Art Institute and I wanted to take Meghan with because I thought that she would enjoy it more than I did.  I was wrong.  She did enjoy the museum thoroughly, she wants to come back but I think it had a bigger impact on me.  I've been to the Louve (Paris, France) but didn't really spent a lot of time there and it was with family.  This time, granted it was a smaller museum compared to the Louve, it was with Meghan.  It was a different experience.  It was a lot of fun she was able to show me and educate me about art and the artists and the styles of art from realism, to surrealism to impressionism, modern, post-modern, abstract and there is so much more.  I definitely want to go back and spend an entire day just walking around, lounging, soaking everything in.  Taking pictures and writing down how I feel about the piece.  I can't wait to go back.  I somehow feel a sense of balance now with my new found interest in the arts and culture to counteract my "party boy" persona.  It seems that I have forgotten about that aspect of my life for a little while now and it's good to sit back and read a book for a change instead of just playing video games.  I still enjoy playing video games, sports games and fighting games and watching mindless TV to just feel dumb for a few hours but sometimes the need to learn or exercise the brain be it in the form of music or reading is more enjoyable that just being lazy.  I think it's time to seriously put some time and effort into learning to play the guitar, it's going to be painful for the roomies but I'll try not to disturb the roomies.  Sorry for not putting up something that is for discussion, I'll see what I can do about that in the future.  For now, people can suffer reading this crap.
