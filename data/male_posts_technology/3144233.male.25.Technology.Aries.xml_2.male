It stayed pretty cold all day and we got through another hilly part of the trek which again was tough going. We were unwelcomed at this little caf√© in the hills by a tutting woman.  We knew today was going to be a long trip with an extended section into the night. It was hard enough to navigate in darkness but we had thick mist to deal with as well. Joel navigated us through pretty well though and we got to a pub in the middle of nowhere for some food.   We had yet another stage to the walk to get to where we are staying. Odd place but nice enough.  We plan to finish tomorrow evening after another night walk and thirty miles.   See you all soon.
