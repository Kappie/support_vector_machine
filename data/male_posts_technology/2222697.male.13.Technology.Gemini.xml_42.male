There we're more preps there and i found out again that it is impossible to get a girlfriend.  After the party was over harrison called his parents inside and i walked around. Pages dad walked in and got pissed at me. Either being rich means you have no decent man-hood or you are just a sob. The rest was fun i guess. Tired i am.....good night.
