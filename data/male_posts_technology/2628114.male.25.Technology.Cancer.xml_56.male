The RCGC (Running Club of Greater Cincinnati) hosted the event and fun was had by all.  I ran surprisingly and almost unbelievably fast based on my time.  For the 5 mile course, my time said 36:50 which puts me at 7:12 minute miles on average.  I may have been going fast, but it certainly didn't feel like that fast.  Who knows?  I felt great and instituted a new stretching technique where I only stretch after my run.  I let my body warmup and stretch out on the run with some incredibly minor stretches before then do a full stretch routine afterward.  What resulted was feeling good on the run and tremendous afterward.  My knee pain is all but gone and I am excited to get back on a regular running schedule.  Bring on NYC if I get in or Columbus if I don't!    One thing to note, some runners (okay, a lot of runners) are on crack.  We finished between 9:30a.m. and 10:30a.m. yesterday to return to a cookout which included hamburgers, chips, pretzels, and other good after run snacks including chocalate covered cicadas and jalapeno cicada poppers.  On top of all that, there was a stinking KEG of beer!  There are times when I am not even up that early in the morning, let alone have a desire to drink.  But hey, according to one of the runners, "You have to get your carbs somehow!"  Right, give me some pasta and wheat bread anytime.  The burger was weird enough to eat at that time.
