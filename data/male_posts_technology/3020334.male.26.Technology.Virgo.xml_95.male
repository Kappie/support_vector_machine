Bluejacking   An intruder sends messages to your bluetooth device without your authorization.   Bluesnarfing  An intruder obtains data in your device silently via bluetooth without your authorization and attention.    Luckily I do not own bluetooth-enabled phone/device right now, therefore there is little impact on me. =)  References   urlLink Bluetooth phones at risk from 'snarfing' (ZDNet UK)   urlLink 'Bluejacking' hits the mainstream (ZDNet UK)
