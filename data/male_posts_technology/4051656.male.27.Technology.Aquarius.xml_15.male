People like  urlLink Gamespy  and  urlLink The All-Seeing Eye  have been offering this type of service for the PC since online gaming first evolved.  urlLink Playstation  has been offering a free online game service since the PS2 came out, and  urlLink Sega  trailblazed the market with their free dial-up game service SegaNet.   I have to hand it to Microsoft though; they have the best console on the market, and Xbox live is as convenient and smooth as you could possibly want. It's no secret that Microsoft is out to make a buck, but why does it have to be such a big number? $70 per year is a ripoff.   Trolling around one of my gaming forums, I found out about something called  urlLink XBConnect  and  urlLink XLink Kai . These are both "tunneling" services, which allow you to play system-link enabled games online for free. What they do is fool your Xbox into thinking that it is connected to a Local Area Network (LAN) so that you can play with others using the service. Pretty cool.   I'm at work right now, so obviously I can't test them out. I'm gonna give them a try tonight with Full Spectrum Warrior. I'll let you know what I think and whether or not the services are viable.
