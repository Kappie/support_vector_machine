Well, felt embarassed to the core when my mentor ringed me and thanked me for his son, I'm not great, he is a greater human coz he is architecting lives of umpteen number of students daily, atleast 300 in a day,  How many days had I disturbed him in his sleep and asked for clarifying my doubt, how any times had he given me directions to take up my life, God give him long life to architect much more students.  He is a Sincere and honest teacher, he never even got a penny from me for all this, he is a kind hearted soul, God let him not face hardship.  I remember a dialoguefrom a recent Telugu trash movie but the verses r really true,  a millionaire hardly helps in creating / making another millionaire ( except for blood relationship ) but an educated person can create / make 1000 other educated persons , who else it can be other than teachers .    "Matha, Pitah, Guru, Deivam "   - old saying    how true it is ?   Parents  play a major role in one's life by providing proper education and comfort along with love filled care.   Teacher  - tutors, guides, moulds the life of the student    God  - always guides the path chosen by him for any individual.  what I wud 've been had I not had these persons in my life , sure God is always there for the needy but will I ever be able to knwo about hte living Gods- Parents and teachers - Dunno.  Whatever I'm today is due to them and whatever I'll be will always be due to them.  Max - talks abt senti but these are the essence of life which makes life spicy.     A Valentine Ode to My Parents    V = You are the Very best in all the world to me.     A = All the times you helped through good and bad times -- and still are.     L = Love for me, you have biven unconditionally, all my 25 years on God's earth.  Love you both without any questions. Your love for me and you makes my love for you and others blossom like a new flower in a garden, on a summer's day.    E = Everything you touch and do makes life worthwhile, to live, makes me a better person, because of you.     N = Nobody could ever replace my perfect parents, God sent on earth especially for me.     T = Two fine teachers who taught me that love is the most important part of my life.   You taught me to walk, tie my shoes, read and have self respect, pray the way I still can. Everyday you taught something new, and taught me to love my enemies, and my neighbors, as myself. Nobody can ever take that away from me. You gave me so much from teaching, that no school teacher has ever done.    I = I love you so much, you are important to me. I will try my best to take care of you.     N = Nicest parents ever. I've got the best parents in the world.     E = Everything you gave up, so I could have the things I needed.   Even though you needed things, you put us first. Our home was meek and cozy, but it was home, and still is, whether I live in it or not. I can still feel you here with me. I close my eyes, and see, smell and hear the five of us. You are my everything always and forever.   My loving mind and heart for you both, gave my mind to write this, with God at my side.  Love, your Son    Ode to Great Teachers    A grain of truth becomes the bread of life,  the hidden mist in your sage words.   "What is the difference between butterflies and flies?  between birds  bugs? between discourse and discord?"  And something about freedom, something about what is not.   How quickly what you say becomes important.  How important what you say becomes to me  butterflies, freedom  discourse.   More important is that I now know the difference  between art  artifice  between candor  candidate  between stealth  stealing.   This knowing is my garb, Something the mist of your words helped fashion.  Cover  spear, lion's mane, coil and recoil.   Each grain from that truth, from that loaf of bread you offered  combs through sands, pebbles  stone,  winces  denounces the feeble vision, so plentiful.  Teaches instead of quiet wisdom  good spirits  the simple happy song   Teach us yet, why is it so rare?  - Ur student     ODE TO GOD - Max'll upload sometime in near future
