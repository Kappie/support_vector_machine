Found a copy of the BT performance at Two Tribes this year. Daimo will like it I'm sure, as we were there and he's always asking if I've got any new mixes from this year. Anyway, not much else on. Not even sure why I'm posting, but you get that on the big jobs. :) Last night was a good night, just down at PAs with Joe and Danny, whileCathy, Steph and 'Tinewere off handbag shopping. Then they joined us later and we all had Parma's* and Pots and a Perve (* Joe having the Vegetarian Foccacia since he's a stinking vego)  So we all got pretty pissed and took a taxi home, just another good night out talking crap and laughing ourselves silly. :)
