It claimed Iran allowed eight al-Qaida future airplane hijackers to pass through Iran from Afghanistan between seven and 11 months prior to the attacks on America."  Here are some excerpts from the report:   "In late 1991 or 1992, discussions in Sudan between al Qaida and Iranian operatives led to an informal agreement to cooperate in providing support if only training actions carried out primarily against Israel and the United states long afterward, senior al Qaida operatives and trainers traveled to Iran to receive training in explosives."   "Our knowledge of the international travels of the al Qaida operatives selected for the 9/11 operation remains fragmentary. But we now have evi=dense suggesting that 8 to 10 of the 14 Saudi “muscle”operatives traveled into or out of Iran between October 2000 and February 2001.121."   There are many more that point to the cooperation of al-Qaida and Iran. Now to throw fuel on the fire, get a load of this from the NY Times:   "Iran has broken the U.N. nuclear watchdog's seals on centrifuge equipment and resumed building the devices, which are key to making nuclear weapons, in a show of defiance against international efforts to monitor its program, diplomats said Tuesday."   Now the magic question is are we going to do anything about it? More appropriately is Bush going to do anything about it. Is he going toride the fear of terrorism and gamble that people won't want to switch presidents if there is another possible threat or even put off the elections? I don't think Bush will be able to pull anything off this close to election and would more than likely have to go through "proper channels" this time such as brining it to the UN and making the case Iran is breaking the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. I'm surethe US Jewish population and Israel will start putting pressure ontheir buddy Bush since Iran is a regime that denies Israel's right to exist. Does anyone think they can convince the UN to do anything? This will be the next hot spot to watch out for I'm sure.
