I had never heard of that title, so I assumed it was nothing special.  According to IMDB , the movie is directed by Ron Howard (wow) and stars Russell Crowe andRenee Zellweger. Russell Crowe is an idiot, but I wouldn't mind bumping into Renee Zellweger...   By the way, the scene I saw being filmed had dozens of old 1930's style cars. At first I thought it was some type of auto show, but all the cars were basically identical, so I wondered "who would want to pay to see 50 identical cars"?   I bet those cars aren't worth very much, because there more than likely just golf carts that have an old "Model T" looking body over them.
