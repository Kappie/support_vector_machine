Those damn aliens.  They're everywhere!  Just when you think you got ride of them, one of them shows up.    Now I can hear it...soon people around the office are going to start complaining that things are disappearing.  Things are being misplaced. Things have been chewed or biten. Erasers, lead pencils, pens, paper clips, lunch pails and tucked away snack foods have vanished without a trace.  Well I know what's happening...the root cause of all of this distress.  It's those damn aliens!  They ate my volks too!
