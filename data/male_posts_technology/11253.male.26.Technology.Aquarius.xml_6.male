It was from the days when I was living with my Dad after uni and working for Pilks. It was a month or two before I went to work in the USA which would have made a much more interesting blog had I done it.  Tomorrow I'm off to London for my induction meeting at my new company. I'm so relieved to leave NCorp that I haven't really given the new place much thought. I'm sure it will be great, I was really into the new place 3 months ago when I got the job but  urlLink the pangalactic bellwether in miserable notice periods  has kind of taken the sparkle off it a bit.  At least the train ride down will give me time to write to manda - haven't been in touch since the wedding - bad pen pal!
