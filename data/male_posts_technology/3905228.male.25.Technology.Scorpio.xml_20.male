Am I going to strike a  Balance or what am I going to do ?                  Well , I'll be  as truthful I can be and I still will be as eluding as I've to  be.                  Last two weeks ,  I'm not me . There used to be a time I thought can't a the days be Saturday  and Sunday and was cursing why were 5 other days in the week spoiling my  mood.                   But that is a  part of history.       I now hate weekends. May be I'm having a hangover,  pondering over the past without moving ahead with  reality.                  I don't want to  be obselete. That will what I'll become if I continue in the same way. I've  planned my next two weeks and it is Jampacked. I'm fine with it. I know if I  could handle it during next two weeks, I can do that  anytime.                  For all those  who r wondering on what I'm blabbering about, All I need to tell U is I'm having  Nightmares.                  I know the cause  , I know the Solution but I can't implement it and I'm in a helpless  position.                  All I need is  little patience which I'm finding it hard to have.                  I never rush  things though I'm aggressive but I've 6 more months to spend.                    I know it is  only 6 months for many of u but believe me I'm the guy with mindset of enjoy ur  stay in this life by living every moment but still I find it  tough.                  I'm not afraid  of pain or trauma I undergo.                  I don't want  anyone sympathyising with me , I just want to say it pains.                    people  sayBraveness is holding ur emotions.                  But upto my  limited knowlege and experience , I say Braveness is knowing u r weak and  expressing it whenit hurts / pains , Brave r those who accept their  weakness , at the same time confront them and living ahead with  them, That is what Braveness is.                  I'm now in the  process of becoming Brave and I know I'm brave  !
