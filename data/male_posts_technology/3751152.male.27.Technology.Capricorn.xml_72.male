It was in Loughborough which is a nice enough town in the East Midlands - about an hour and a half by train from London. So it was an early start on Tuesday having to leave the house at 7am, not nice especially since I'm never normally out of bed til 8.30! The conference was about Computer Aided Assessment - so getting students to do self-assessment and exams using a selection of online tests using objective question types (like multiple choice). Anyways, the conference papers were ok - some were great, others not so. The best bit for me was the evening's entertainment - a casino!  We were all given 4000 (fake - boo!) pounds to play with - apart from those of us who managed to convince the guy giving out the money that there really WERE two additional people sitting at our table ;) So I had 6000 pounds worth of fake money (boo!) in my pocket and headed to the poker table first, exchanging only 2000 to begin with. Started off ok, won a few hands - didn't win all that much but managed to get up to about 3500. Moved onto another table where they had wheel of fortune and managed to win another couple of thousand on that. So feeling lucky I moved over to the roulette table.   I bet cautiously at first, betting on odd, black and the occasional number or group of numbers, and I started winning. I'd managed to get up to about 18,000 (ooh and a bottle of champagne for having number 22 come up!) when I felt a bit tired and decided to try and lose all my money before retiring to bed. So I placed a few chips worth 5000 on various numbers round the board. Monster had texted me earlier and said to remember lucky black 3 - so out of loyalty I placed one on number 3 - it hadn't won me anything earlier in the evening, but what the heck I wasn't after winning. So the ball goes round and round and drops....into number 3! 175,000 (fake) pounds was mine! Highest win of the night....bugger, now I had to get rid of all that lot ;) Eventually managed to lose it all - it's amazing how quickly you can go from winner to loser, and toddled off to bed.  I'm hoping that lady luck will be looking out for me this saturday on the lottery superdraw :)
