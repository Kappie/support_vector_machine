What I have issue with particularly :  "But to suggest that the idiots promoting the theory that she had kidnapped herself to spite her parents or for the money were all left-leaners is surely just plain ignorance?"  I'm pretty sure all of those proposing this theory on the forums I used to base my conclusion on, are well-known leftists.  "To suggest that only evil people commit crimes and that nobody is forced into crime – well that smacks of more ignorance."  I don't buy that. To resort to crime in a difficult situation, is weak. Even evil. For as many people who, in bad situations, turn to crime, there are as many, if not more, who choose to find work, or embrace religion, or something along those lines. Adopting crime as a way out makes you a bad person, period. There is always a choice no matter how hard things may seem. Choosing the path of crime, therefore, means choosing the path of evil.  I'll concede some points, such as the generalisation that the Left denies that evil people exist. Sure. But like I stated in my comment, the propensity for 'moderate' leftists to buy cheap tabloid conspiracy trash unquestioningly leads me to believe that the Left majority chooses to rely on emotion over logic, and chooses the comfort of pointing blame at the victims instead of the perpetrators. Yes, I've conversed with some lefties capable of more rational thought, who question the conspiracy theories that their peers lap up, but from my personal experiece they comprise the minority of that particular political segment.  No doubt this will draw flak, but I remain convinced that the ratio of nuts to moderates is far higher within the left-wing, than the right.
