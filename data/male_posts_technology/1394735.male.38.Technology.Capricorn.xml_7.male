The following dialog can be heard:  [Voices On Television] Really I did. Oh, yeah, well, how come...you don't have your yellow card with you? Well, I... I...must've left it back in Nam on the base. Yeah, they all say that."Left it back in Nam on the base."  Uh-huh. Let me show you what we do to people...who left it back in Nam on the base. Oh, no! Please let go of me! Where are you taking me? You gotta be punished for not carrying...your shot record on you. It's a fate far worse than death. [Voices Become Indistinct]  Two questions:  What movie or TV show is this dialog from?  Why is it in the Transporter movie?  Things don't usually make it onto movie soundtracks by accident.  Anyone know if there is some inside story here?
