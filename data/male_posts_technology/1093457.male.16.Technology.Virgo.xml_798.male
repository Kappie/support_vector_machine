Hey ho. Um yes. Well school is ok actually, I have a group of people I could call 'friends', probably more associates, but hey, I got to start somwhere. I'm still getting the 'oh let's all talk to the new girl and try to drag her into our clan' which isn't too bad, as everywhere I go people talk to me and yell hi across the corridors and stuff, which makes me feel liked so all's good atm.
