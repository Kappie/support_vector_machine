ESPN NFL2K5 = $20  Going to buy it during lunch.  Holla Holla.  I really don't care if Madden is going to be out in 3 weeks, shit, two games for $70 it's all good!  Black Arrow is out in two weeks and I heard that it's only going to be $40.  Going to pre-order that shit today too at Game Crazy.  Got the bonus for the quarter so I got some loot to throw around.  Gotta renew my XBOX Live subscription.  Not sure what my gamertag will be.  I kinda want a new one but at the same time to keep it simple, I'll just renew the damn thing, fuck it.  I just can't wait for HALO 2.  Might even pre order another one and sell it or some shit.  Nothing planned for the weekend.  Might go hit up a bar tonight since I really can't do shit tomorrow.  Dinner sounds good as hell already.  Going to make some hotdogs and fries...or just make some prok chips.  Had some hot wings last night, good stuff.  I really don't have much to update on today, just really busy at work.
