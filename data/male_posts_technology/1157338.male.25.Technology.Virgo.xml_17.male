I'm certainly in a better mood now, still haven't gotten much sleep, but that's OK, it's a holiday weekend! so here's how things have been lately -  did my first deployment to our public webserver, until now I've mainly worked up internal apps for us, you know, stuff to help us manage our business more effectively. It helps the company to better streamline their workflow. In a slightly more common tongue - my apps have helped us get our work done quicker and easier.  However, I've finally gotten to put something out to our members only website - in other words, for subscribers only, but still, people other than employees are getting to see some of my work.   Have put out 2 things - 1) a new menu written in Javascript instead of the hairy VBScript one we had that included 12 asp files on every page just to generate the menu (decrease load time substantially I'd say) - and 2)  a new mapping page that is totally frickin awesome - and has consumed my worklife every day for about 3 weeks now, with only occasional breaks to maintain other stuff.  its' neato , you go to the menu, pick out a client, one of their farms, and one of their fields (from a pop up javascript dialog box, with data generated on the fly) - and then tell it to "go" - it then calls a webservice that takes in those inputs, goes and finds all the data we have related to that field - each set of data called a theme - each theme has a legend and a map associated with it - and each field has from 1 - 40 themes.  so my webservice takes the field, finds all the data, and DYNAMICALLY CREATES LEGENDS AND MAPS from it.  frickin cool stuff.  it's not just grabbing predefined images, but actually creating them.  I'm creating all the images as PNG's, and that way I can have a variable amount of transparency/opacity for each map image - meaning that when you stack all the differnent theme maps up together, you can actually see through them to the others.  As if that wasnt' enough - I also call another webservice from my webservice, to download aerial imagery and topographical maps from  urlLink  TerraServer  which I then scale, trim, and place behind my maps - so you can see that your Ph levels are low, becuase that field has a high spot, or because it runs next to the road and gets a lot of crap dripped down on it when it rains.  The web page also lets you dynamically drag and drop the legends in order to change the way the maps stack - in real time with no posting back to the webserver. - oh, you also choose to turn the themes on and off on the fly as well - you could have all 30 turned on, or nothing, just click a checkbox next to the theme name. I'm quite proud :D  the Game dev is going well - the MIA developers have still not shown much oomph. Got one guy kinda back. Hasn't done much but complain so far, so we'll see how much good he does.  Still, even with that kind of setback, we're still kicking ass. CEO decided to slip the date a week.  I think we coulda done it, but I'm glad to get to enjoy my holiday weekend.  I think I finished the last major coding section of it tonight - we decided to add it in so that we could include all the skills for each class, and not just a demo-tagged subset. So our users will probably be able to transfer their saves to the new game without much problem, which is a goal I think we should shoot for.  Now that the codebase is done, we can focus on scripting hte plot events. - guess I get to learn python, cause that's what we're using there.  I fixed about 8 scripts earlier, just by reading through some ones we had that I knew worked, doesn't seem horrible, but I'd have to have to create them from scratch, as I'm still pretty lost on it.  I've chatted enough for now, time to get back to work.  Phil.
