Not physically, no, an idea, or rahter, a path...  I don't know where it came from. I've wanted to be a programmer since I was 8 years old; i've been programming since I was 8 years old... but... While thinking about what I like to do, the aspects of my Job I enjoy, what I like to do while programming... I think I was _made_ to sell cars.  My brother Rob went through 4 years of Electrical Engineering at Queens University, and he now works at Ottawa Hydro; sure, he does random electrical engineering things, but want to know what the favourite part of his job is? Organizing meetings, networking with people, organzing and assigning people to do stuff; and he's good at it. enough so, thats pretty much what he does now... Thats what he would be doing as a car salesmen.  I really like working with computers, but all the mystery and appeal of working with them is gone; coding seems dry to me... but at my Job at the independant, i'm constantly talking to people; people who come through my cash usually come through again. I know a university professer, a women who owns her own construction company, a women who wants me to tutor her son programming... all these people who know me; even though I'm just a cashier at a grocery store.  I think I would really enjoy being a car salesmen. I think its what i'm built to do. And on top of that, the pay would be amazing, and I'd get tons of time off to persue other intrests [such as programming].  I scheduled a guidence appointment, and i'm going to talk to my dad about it, but yeah... nuts.
