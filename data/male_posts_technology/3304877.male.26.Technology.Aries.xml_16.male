'. you can navigate so much more quickly this way then with the mouse.  i do have a couple beefs that i hope will be ironed out. first, i can't seem to be able to set signatures. i could be missing some setting here or something but i can't seem to find a way to specify a signature. second, i don't like the fact that everyone i send an email to become a contact. for example, i changed the email associated with my  urlLink aim  account and this involved replying to a confirmation email from  urlLink aol . that reply-to address was added as a contact that i had to explicitly delete. maybe there's an option to control this but i couldn't find it. finally, and most importantly, it doesn't seem to work right in  urlLink safari . this is paramount to me since my  urlLink ibook  is my primary email/surfing box at home and at work.   i think that if these rinkles get worked out,  urlLink gmail  will be a total replacement for me.
