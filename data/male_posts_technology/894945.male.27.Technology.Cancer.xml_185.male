However this has now been spoiled by Custard who decided to hit me round the head several times with a beer bottle last night, splitting my ear open and causing me to loose several pines of blood.    “Custard you’re a CUNT”  Toaster thankfully was there to save the day and tried to drag me off to the toilets before to many people noticed.  We decided to call it a night after that and I stumbled back to my brother, Dougal’s flat to sleep on his couch.  Even with all that excitement we still had a really good night.  Toaster and I also bumped into our favourite toasterette, Chrissie.  I’m happy to inform the world that Chrissie in still not wearing any underwear and has been given the privilege of a toaster nickname of “Commando”.  For those of you read and don’t know who Chrissie is,  urlLink click here .  She is the one, second from the right being hugged by Toaster.  Chrissie you’re a Star!!!!
