Abide with me (fast falls the eventide) 3. Rock of Ages cleft for me (let me hide myself....) 4. The battle belongs to the Lord. 5. Lift high the (your?) cross. 6. Man of sorrows. 7. Take my life, and let it be. 8. Make me a captive Lord. 9. God moves in mysterious ways. 10. O God our help in ages past..  Maybe you guys (and girls) have some more suggestions....?
