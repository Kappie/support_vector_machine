 Boy have I got a headache.  I spent a few hours this morning driving down 27th street looking at used cars.  Most of the big dealerships on the strip there have cars that are out of my price range for the 2 years I expect this next car to be mine, but it was worth a try.  Anyway, the sun is beating down today and all that driving around and squinting at the sticker prices has given me a headache. 

 I had a bologna sandwich when I got home and played with the dog for a little bit.  My stomach seems to be doing well today, not too much issue with the sandwich.
