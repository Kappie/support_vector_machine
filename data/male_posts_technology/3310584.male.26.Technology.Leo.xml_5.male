Category: Windows 98/ME/2000/XP  Create Your Own Toolbars  You can make the Windows taskbar more useful by adding toolbars to it. Right-click on the taskbar and select Toolbars to see choices for several built-in toolbars, including Address, Desktop, and Quick Launch.  But perhaps the most interesting option is New Toolbar, which lets you create a toolbar to get fast access to any folder, file, or URL.  Among other uses, creating a personal toolbar can be helpful for immediate access to a particular group of files--if you're working on a long-term project, for example, and want one-click access to all the files or subfolders in the project directory.
