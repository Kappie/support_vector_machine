Come to think of it, if you're single, female, cute, intelligent why don't you  urlLink e-mail me  as well?  A nice, relaxing sunny day in the back garden... I came in and made a drink, flipping across the channels and Big Brother was on. For ten minutes the camera showed Jade, sitting down in the garden, covered by a quilt, with a not-so-bright expression on her face. It occured to me that perhaps 25 thousand people were sitting at home, covered in a quilt, watching Jade doing the exact same thing. God bless technology.
