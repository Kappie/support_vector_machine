Alright folks, not a lot of time, but a thought to ponder... If you set your goals lower then yourself, are you a success? If you tell yourself, "I'm going to trip on my own damn feet..." and you do, then are you not a successful failure?  Now that I've completely confused you, heres the one link for now...   urlLink The only place I know of that has some great stuff. Games, News, shopping...you got it all, I guess.
