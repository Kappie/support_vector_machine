With all the  urlLink brouhahaover the name  of  urlLink Lopamudra Ghatak , I decided to dig around a bit for some more  dirt  information on her. So I hopped on to our friendly neighbourhood search engine and  urlLink searched for 'Lopamudra Ghatak' . Weeding out the results pointing or referring to Economic Times, the first search result ( without any reference to the 'salmon pink coloured dishrag' ) was  urlLink this one , pointing to a message board on  urlLink Rediff.com . The said message board wason the article by Sucheta Dalal, urlLink Selling news or buying silence , which exposed the evil TOI-Medianet nexus, last year.    Here's what Miss ( or Mrs., as the case may be )Ghatak had to say on Sucheta Dalal's exposé...     Dear Sucheta,     As a journalist working with a computer publication, I thought that your article was in good stead. It is time that such stories hit the front page of national dailies, rather then being pushed to some obscure column item in page 5.  The reader expects certain level of honest and ethical reporting of incidents -- an objective view of situations, reported truthfully. That's what journalism is technically supposed to be as I was taught at my mass comm institute(IIMC, new delhi). but its quite distressing to see such prostitution of news and dishing out trash in the name of reportage.  And who cares whether Salman Khan beats up Aishwarya black and blue or pounds at her door consistently for 3 hours in the wee hours of the morning. there are numerous women in the country who get abused , at hoem, in the work place or in public. Do they ever make it to the front page of any daily?  Its high time that the readers are stopped being taken for granted and fed nonsense news, day after day.      [emphasis mine]      What can I say?!! ... I leave you, gentle readers, to ponder over her statements, while I burst out laughing!!    *ROTFL*
