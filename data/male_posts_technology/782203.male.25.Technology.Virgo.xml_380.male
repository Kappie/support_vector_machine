Well it's not exactly true, there's this beautiful and really amazing thing that I see almost everyday but it doesn't really count. Was also trying to find beauty in my work to make it less tedious but that didn't happen either; I guess beauty isn't EVERYWHERE. ;)   Was listening to A Perfect Circle's Thirteenth Step the whole day while doing my work. I am so in love with the album. It's incredibly mellow (read: very soft) but hell the music is just so beautiful. Go check it out.   Not having a great day today. Can't wait to go back.
