The house owner owns the complete building and given all flats on rent. On that morning around 7.45, I was sleeping in my bed, another rommie was having shower in the bathroom and the 3rd one went on terrace to do some pooja.   The 3rd roomie daily moves out like this for 10 mins, and on that day someone just swiped our room within those 10 mins and imagine what we have lost.   I have lost my Titan Watch worth 1200/- and Wallet having 1400/- Cash and All other Cards and info. My another rommie has lost his mobile worth 6500/- and wallet having 1400/- Cash. Nobody came to know about this untill it was time to move to office.   This was really bad as we all were in house when this theft happened. Nobody could imagine that we will face such a situation. House door was open for just 5-10 mins and its gone....   It was a good lesson for us but a costly one. In future we will be very careful about such things. On that eve only we installed a night latch on our door... hee hee hee doesn't it sounds like "we are applying locks on stable after hourses ran away"... but we have to do it either now or later.   Well, just a request to you all to be careful about such small things which may lead to a serious problem in life.   Shrenik.
