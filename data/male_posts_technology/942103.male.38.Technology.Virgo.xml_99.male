There's much more granularity with LJ than there is with Blogger and that's what really appeals to me.  I mean, I don't mind sharing with people; that's what I started the silly thing for in the first place.  But sometimes issues crop up in my life that I'm not ready to tell the world in general about but maybe my local group of friends should know.  Blogger just doesn't easily allow for that.  The thing that keeps me here is the very lengthy history of blog that I've created already.  I was looking for some sort of conversion utility but that doesn't seem to exist.  So I choose now between: 1) Sticking with Blogger and dealing with the lack of granularity for posts.  2) Converting posts already made over by hand, one at a time, into LJ.  3) Just leaving Blogger here with a pointer to my new LJ home.  Choice #2 seems like the only reasonable long-term answer at this point.  Choice #1 is probably the least likely unless Blogger announces some amazing new changes.  When they were bought out by the Google behemoth I thought this might occur.  It has not.  The third choice is really not feasible because Blogger deletes blogs which haven't been updated in some predetermined time period.  And I don't want that.  So, for now, I will continue to research.  But in the long term, look for my new home over on LJ, which has existed for some time already but only has  urlLink one entry .    Comments are welcome.
