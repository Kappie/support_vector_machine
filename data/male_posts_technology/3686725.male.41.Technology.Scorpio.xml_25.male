We've got to set up a couple of accounts, one for emergency reserves and one to fund an offset each month for the additional payment we'll be making.  And a few more bills to handle personally.  and we should be left with about $8K to play with.  And that's not including the single house payment we get to skip that we would normally be making this month.  We know the things we'd like to do but we've got to sit down and map it out--priorities vs available funds--but for now we can celebrate knowing that for once in over a decade and a half we do not have any major financial worries.  We will be able to pay bills (on time! and and in full!) and still buy groceries at the end of the month.  And all the while our credit will be mending as time passes.    Naturally, the wife and I figured we earned the right to go out and celebrate.  We chose one of our standards: Macaroni Grill.  It was unusually crowded for a Tuesday night, no doubt owing to the end of the school year for many folks, but we were seated reletively soon.  The food was good, the wine passable and the celebration relaxing.    As it often does, the conversation turned to the church and this time on confession.  I mentioned that the Jews believe that you must first confess and apologize to the one you've wronged before you can confess to God.       [section redacted]   Or maybe I'm just in denial and this will come back to bite me (and us) later.  But as I see it, if there's nothing to be done about a situation, there's little point in worrying about it.  What matters now is what is going on now.  And right now things are good and look like they are going to get better.
