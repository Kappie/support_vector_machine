This was in a shopping center parking lot. Now it's true that many shopping centers have bad speed bumps: speed bumps which would stop large tanks in their tracks until the brave men and women of the Corps of Engineers came forward and applied a pound of C-4 so the tanks and the convoy could get through and defeat the enemy. But this shopping center has reasonable speed bumps, which can be taken at 5-7 mph with only minor discomfort, even by my passengers with bad backs.  The security golf-carts don't even slow down for these bumps.    This Cadillac Escalade was slowing to sub-walking speed, possibly even sub-crawling speed. As nobody was actually crawling around the parking lot this would be hard to judge, but slow pedestrians were passing this Escalade as it slooooowed dooooown to go ooooover the buuuuump.    I dunno. Those Cadillacs have a lot of electronics. Maybe the guy was testing his altimeter.
