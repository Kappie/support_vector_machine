I'm not a republican, so I don't know why I got this piece of mail.  Oh, and if I want to go to the dinner, I just have to make a donation of $150 or more.  That food must be really good!  I wonder if they'll foot the bill for the airfare.    I'm thinking of buying Robert Reich's new book,  urlLink Reason: Why Liberals Will Win the Battle for America , to get better educated about how the republicans are duping the American voters.  The majority of American's are non-voters who generally have liberal values:  belief in separation of church and state, that taxation and wealth should be more equally distributed, and everyone should have fair access and fair opportunity.  It's funny, whenever I talk to Christians, they believe that the majority of Americans believe in a Christian God -- they may even believe that this majority includes practicing Christians -- people who attend church on a regular basis.  Personally, I think most American celebrate Jewish or Christian holidays, because that's how they were raised, and they consider themselves Christian (or Catholic) or Jewish, but they don't truly believe or they don't truly practice.  It's scary to me that Bush says he talks to God, and gets direction from God.  First off that's a little crazy, maybe it appeals to some fanatical religious people.  But mostly, it's a bit scary, that he feels he's doing what morally right and what God wants him to do.  He also talks about the military like it's his own personal army.  I'm going to send more troops to Iraq ... I'm going to send more troops to Afghanistan.  Even the Pope is against the war, but Bush seems to ignore that.  The Pope's view doesn't gibe with Bush's so Bush ignores the Pope.  Not that I put a lot of value in the pope.  It's scary that we pre-emptively attacked Iraq, and that some democrats approved giving Bush the power to declare war.  Why is congress giving up it's powers?  If Bush is president for another 4 years, the American life as we know it will completely cease to exist (it's already on the way out with things like the PATRIOT act).  Speaking of the PATRIOT act, I think it's quite clever (maybe conniving is a better word) for them to create an acronym spelling PATRIOT, when the act really has nothing to do with patriotism.  It's really about giving up individual freedoms and more government control.  And it's scary that Bush has pushed for massive tax cuts for the rich, while pushing more responsibilities onto the states.  Now the states can't handle the new financial responsibilities, and they have to make cuts in other programs -- number of teachers, teacher pay, school programs, state government workers, countless other things that I'm not aware of.  I don't know if Kerry will be any better.  But I'm definitely in the "anybody but bush" camp.  Personally, I like Kucinich (who opposed the war with Iraq), and I'd consider voting for an independent, if I thought they realistically had a chance to win in this two party system -- either someone from the Green party or the Libertarian party.
