Not only that but if there are like 6 terrorists on the plane they can easily take the plane, the air marshals wud be shot and killed possibly with their own guns! Are these air marshals gonna be wearing uniforms? Or are they just gonna look like normal passingers? Nicki you saying about  maybe only on transatlantic flights? Whats that gonna do? the terrorists will be more likely to pick on local flights as they did on the 9/11 attack. Most of the planes brought down were local ones!  No onto more pressing matters... The cinema tmor? You sed meet at 12.15? The film actually starts then though!
