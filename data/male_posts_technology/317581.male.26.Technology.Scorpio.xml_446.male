Unfortunately Jewel's book of music is a little too advanced for me right now. So I have Bach, minuet in G that I'm practicing for my piece right now.  Tonight I'm going to costco to find a new piano with weighted keys. Hopefully it won't be too expensive. Well, I need to get back to Xenocide.  Check ya later-
