If you are in a therapist’s office, it takes a great leap of faith to simply wait.  There are lots of possible negative outcomes here.  What if no one ever comes??  Maybe they evacuated, maybe they all fainted from carbon monoxide, maybe they all died of the superflu, maybe there is someone holding them at gunpoint, maybe they just don’t want to help YOU.  Maybe they will all come and tell you how messed up you really are, forget the touchy-feely crap, we have a special jacket for you, come see these men in white coats...  Maybe someone looking for you just left, and now you have missed your appointment and will be billed, but in reality you were there waiting the whole time, inventing horrifying possibilities why no one ever came to help you.  Something for me to think about in the waiting room.
