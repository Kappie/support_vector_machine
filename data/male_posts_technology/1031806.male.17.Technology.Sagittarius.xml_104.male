Think I’m being double minded? Well, you’re right, I am. That’s cause I still haven’t really come to terms with myself in conjunction with the whole issue yet.  Point in question: Gwen and I.  Late last year she started hanging around me more, and I, being of the masculine gender (i.e. dumb, adj. Conspicuously unintelligent; see stupid), failed to take notice of it for a while.  When it finally clicked *duhum.. I tink purty gurl likez mee*, I started spending more time around her too. We eventually started doing random stuff together outside of school (movies, having lunch together, bringing her to my youth group several times…) and some people started arbitrarily labeling us as dating, though I didn’t think we were and I think (hope… wonder… whatever) that she didn’t either.  Winter Banquet (see my archives – January 18th) was fun, and we both had a good time. Her dad wanted to meet me first before I took her, so I had lunch at her house back in December, and he and I talked for a while.  I thought it was cool that he cared enough about her to do that, and I started to get to know him (he’s a nice guy), but the general feeling I was getting from Gwen was that she was embarrassed about the whole thing.  (Haha – I probably would be too, in her shoes).  We continued doing random things together into February, though in the last month or so we’ve been starting to get a little distant. She’s constantly to busy to come to youth group, and we haven’t done anything together by ourselves at all except a U.S. History project that we worked on together. (She taught me how to sew! *yay!* Well, sorta – I’m terrible at it *lol*)   I’ve also noticed that I’ve been acting kinda weird with the whole situation too – the most predominant instance that I can think of right now, was back on March 16th, at Melissa’s house.  We had just turned on a movie, and I was one of the first people to sit down.  I was just expecting, by default, that Gwen would want to sit beside me, but instead, she went over to another part of the room and sat beside Butters, who had been acting overtly flirtatious the entire night (I later found out that he was on some type of pain medication, and didn’t even remember the majority of that night.). It may have been the fact that I was depressed to begin with, or it may have be the fact that I noticed Butters holding her hand for a while (or both), but whatever the reason, I just decided it was easier to not worry about it. So I just spaced out for a while, in fact, the only parts that I remember from that point until the end of the movie were several times when Gwen was trying playfully to get Butters not to watch the screen during some supposedly bad parts. (I wouldn’t know whether they were actually bad or not – I wasn’t exactly coherent.) Anyway, a while after the movie was done, Gwen came over and asked if I was okay, and rubbed my back for a second. I replied “yes” (lie) so she wouldn’t worry about it. She didn’t, and I forced myself to cheer up and actually did have a good time for the rest of the party.   In the car on the way home Adrie (her parents were taking both me and Gwen home) asked us if we were officially going out yet, or what the nature of our relationship was. We all talked for a little while, and arrived at the conclusion that we were not dating, but that we (Gwen and I) should talk more about the subject later. We did on im the next Tuesday:  Me: hey I've been thinking a lot over the past couple days about that   rather brief conversation we had in Adrie's car the other day... Me: and I was wondering something Me: how do you see our relationship in terms of what you would want it to be?  i.e. do you like it the way it is right now? Me: sorry, that was kinda out of the blue... Gwen: right now it may be best to get to know each other as friends rather than go into an unstable relationship at this time.  Me: o good Me: I was hoping you were thinking along those lines Me: that's exactly how I have been feeling Gwen: thought so  What was the point of all this?  Well, in our last period class today, she randomly said she needed to talk to me tonight.  I though that probably didn’t mean something good, and was correct.  At 7:17, she called my cell, and we had around a five minute conversation. She made reference to the conversation above and asked if that meant I was okay with her dating another guy. I told her that there should be no true reason why I couldn’t adjust to it over time, but that I would be rather disheartened at first. She asked why, and I answered because I had hoped that we were heading for a closer relationship in the near future. We sorta ended on that note, her saying that she’d let me get back to my homework, and me saying that I’d see her tomorrow.    Now re-read the first two paragraphs of this post and you’ll see kinda what I mean…  Listening to: Saliva – Always (ironically the song that Andy and I kept listening to, to and from a field trip to Oregon City this morning) Feeling:  umm… lol, read the lyrics - listen to the song - whatever   urlLink  Saliva - Always     I hear... a voice say "Don't be so blind"...  it's telling me all these things...  that you would probably hide...  am I... your one and only desire...  am I the reason you breathe...  or am I the reason you cry...    Always... always... always... always... always... always... always...  I just can't live without you...    I love you...  I hate you...  I can't get around you...  I breathe you...  I taste you...  I can't live without you...  I just can't take any more...  this life of solitude...  I guess that i'm out the door...  and now i'm done with you...    I feel... like you don't want me around...  I guess i'll pack all my things...  I guess i'll see you around...  Its all... been bottled up until now...  as I walk out your door...  all I hear is the sound...    Always... always... always... always... always... always... always...  I just can't live without you...    I love you...  I hate you...  I can't get around you...  I breathe you...  I taste you...  I can't live without you...  I just can't take any more...  this life of solitude...  I guess that i'm out the door...  and now i'm done with you...    I love you...  I hate you...  I can't live without you...    I left my head around your heart...  Why would you TEAR MY WORLD APART?...    Always... always... always... always...    I see... the blood all over your hands...  does it make you feel... more like a man...  was it all... just a part of your plan...  the pistol's shakin' in my hands...  and all I hear is the sound...    I love you...  I hate you...  I can't get around you...  I breathe you...  I taste you...  I can't live without you...  I just can't take any more...  this life of solitude...  I guess that i'm out the door...  and now i'm done with you...    I love you...  I hate you...  I can't live without you...    I love you...  I hate you...  I can't live without you...  I just can't take any more... this life of solitude...  I pick myself off the floor...  and now i'm done with you...  Always... Always...  Always...   The night is still young - I have much to do.
