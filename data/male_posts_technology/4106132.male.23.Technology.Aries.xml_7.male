I'm getting really fed up with the way my life is going at the minute - it's just the same boring routine:    Get up  Got to work which I hate - though lunchtimes with the lads are good craic  Come home  go to sleep for a few hours  Get up  sit on computer talking to friends - which is great, I love talking to mates, but I hate using my computer.  Go to bed   ...until the next day when it all starts all over again.  So, tonights exciting events.....have dinner, tidy my room  probably talk to mates on messenger......great fun, eh?  I just wish something exciting would happen in my life every now and again - apart from the usual problems which keep creeping up on me.  I'm getting pretty jealous of some of my mates  how well things are going for them, while everything seems to go pear-shaped for me.  I am really happy for them, I just wish things could go right for me too.
