It was laughable, and by that I mean I seriously laughed through the last fifteen minutes of it. It started off okay and everything, but suddenly got exponentially cheesier.  Cheesy Moment #1: Van Helsing fights Mr. Hyde. Why it was cheesy: Mr. Hyde looked like some Special Effects guy sat a monkey at a computer, ran photoshop, and let the monkey come up with a really crappy animation. It was bad. It looked like a really shitty 3-D cartoon character.  Cheesy Moment #2: The Horses pulling Van Helsing's carriage jump a 100-foot crevice. Why it was cheesy: Take a guess, Sherlock. I wanted to just smack myself for spending $7.50 on this piece of garbage. Horses won't even jump hurdles unless you whip them sufficiently and threaten to take them to the glue factory, so they're sure as hell not going to jump a 100 FOOT RAVINE. Unless I was mistaken and they were actually a band of WILD PEGASUSES. Hey, Frankenstein, Igor, Mr. Hyde, Dracula, Werewolves, little vampire babies, why not PEGASUSES?  Cheesy Moment #3: Dracula's Children Emerge! Well, well, apparently Dracula had some damn potent sperm because he had approximately A BILLION KIDS. You would have sworn the dude was Puerto Rican. I bet the County Welfare Dep. of Transylvania is buyin' their blood. Why it was Cheesy: Um, Dracula's babies? No matter how you look at that, it's cheesy. Dracula isn't supposed to have babies, especially not ones who look like a bunch of bats with Down Syndrome.  Cheesy Moment #4: Frankenstein makes a friend. Why it was cheesy: This is where I started to belly-laugh. Kate Beckensale is fighting the last of Dracula's brides when Frankstein bursts through the window to her rescue. He urges the young Gypsy woman to leave and rescue Van Helsing, as he pummels the vampire chick. On her way out, though, she pauses, turns to Frankenstein, and utters a "Thanks." The look on Frankenstein's face made me want to piss my pants. He totally cried a single tear. At that point my companions eeked out an "Awwww!" and then I thought maybe if I hit them in the face hard enough, they'd cry a single tear too. They actually cried more than one, though.  Cheesy Moment #5: Gypsy girl dies! Why it was Cheesy: Earlier in the film she mentions how much she'd like to see the sea, so it's only appropriate for her to be buried there. As she's being cremated, this really cheesy chime sound plays. And I totally was like, "That's the sound of her spirit floating to heaven!" and people were like, "SSSH, THIS IS THE SAD PART." Then, Van Helsing looks up into the sky only to her face materialize out of the Cumulous Transylvanian clouds and she reunites with her diseased family in the sky. How poignant.  Cheesy Moment #6: Frankenstein rows off into the sunset. Why it was cheesy: Okay, so at the end of the movie, when Van Helsing is burying Gypsy girl and drooling over her face in the sky, Frankenstein's monster (though he's referred, inaccurately, as Frankenstein throughout the entire movie) sets sail on this little shitty hand-built raft, and floats into the sunset. Where you going, pal? Monster Island? You're a freak of nature, so it's not like you can just stop anywhere and be like, "Hey, I'd like to become a citizen...I can speak Spanish, and I know the Anthem." That was seriously the most retarded part in the movie. How's he going to get there? It's the fucking ocean, there's no signs that are like, "Yo, this way to land!" I guess his strategy was to just float. God, that was stupid.  Also, I've come to the conclusion that Dracula is Muslim for three very valid reasons. 1. His Aversion to crosses. Like Muslims, Dracula is repelled by the sight of a crucifix, and upon touching one, will burst into flames. 2. His abundance of wives. In this movie he had three, but, according to Islamic law, he's allowed to have two more. He can perhaps barter goats to acquire the other two. 3. His tendency to only feed at night. Many Muslims forgo the practice of Rhamadan, a traditional fasting that forbids its followers to eat during the day. Sound familiar? I think so.
