I never do these things, expecting anything in return.. I mean if I did then I'd be doing them for the wrong reasons, but i cant help feeling like I'm being taken for granted if I'm doing as many nice little things as I can think of, to make someone elses life a little more filled with smiles, a little brighter.. a little... better in some way, and the most I get back in return is a thankyou. I guess what I'm saying is, that even tho I dont expect it, it would be nice, and make me feel a whole lot better about doing nice things for people, if occassionally some of them, would reciprocate, and do something really thoughtful and nice for me. This is the sort of thing, that when it builds up and you dont talk about it can end, or at least put a lot of stress on a relationship, and I'm not about to lay the blame fully on the other person here.. but rather, I do accept that a large part of this feeling stems from what we all do, which is expect other people , on some level, to respond, react, and interact with us, in the same way and on the same level as we do, to them. This is unreasonable, as we're all different people, but at the same time it's human nature. Hmm. Conundrum. Any thoughts? am I a selfish prick? I had someone, a dear friend, complain about feeling the same way, to me, and I did what I could to try and cheer this friend up, and ironically, it wasnt appreciated :D I guess maybe it's harder to see what others do for us, all the time, if we become complacent, or used to them being there, doing it.. I'm saying we take people for granted. On a lighter note... I headed off to buy a motherboard for the next computer trickle-down effect, the one I really wanted was an 18g pro version 2 (ooOOoer fancy sounding huh?) but budget didnt quite stretch that far, and I decided the 18g version 1 would have to do, so off I went to friendly computer store, where I attempted to haggle the price of $204 down to something a little less 'in a town with only one computer store'ish.. a bit closer to the online/auckland pricing. Mumbling under my breath about ripoff artists, I begrudgingly left with motherboard box under my arm, having talked her down a whopping $4 :/ I guess I'm not quite the charming negotiator that I thought I was - ahh well. Mike and I stopped briefly a little way down the road, to realise the dizzy bitch had bagged an 18GProII instead of the version 1 I'd paid for! bwahaha! Now this, is quite cool, I get what I ideally wanted, other than world peace, and got it for exactly the price I could afford.. saving something close to a hundred bucks. Brilliant. Also bought some trackpants for the gym.. I'm used to shopping in Farmers, where one department goes from xxl -> 6xl, but today I grabbed a pair of xl trackpants, and headed off. They fit. They fit possibly a smidgen closer than I'm used to, but they're comfortable, and dont illustrate the curves of my frank'n'beans, so they'll do nicely. $20. Excellent. I didnt cave in and get the token 'rotorua' hoodie this time, but I'm sure it wont be long till I do. I spent what little change I had left on a couple of Pork steaks for dinner, because ol' smokey eyed up the pork at the supermarket the other night, but I think declined due to cost.. he loves pork.. so I thought it might put a smile on his dial. Pork steaks, bacon cabonara, and butterbeans.. he's in quite the jovial mood. Excellent. And on that note, I'm gunna go watch some celebs bash each others brains out, in the name of charity. Neet neet folks!
