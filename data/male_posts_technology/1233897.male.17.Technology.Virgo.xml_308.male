My parents changed the locks on my room and the office so I can't use a computer or do anything else normal. They're gone right now and I have no idea what else they have in store for me...  I'll prolly not be posting for a while outside of school, so, as KT says, tootles.  Oh, btw Mandy, if you're reading this, I'm sorry. I wasn't even thinking about prom and all that when all this happened... This was all just too spur-of-the-moment. I probably killed our plans about going, and again, I'm really sorry.
