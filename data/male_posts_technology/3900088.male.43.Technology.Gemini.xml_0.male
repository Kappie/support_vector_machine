He's got senile dementia, its got to the stage where the ppl at the oap-home cant look after him anymore, so he's being moved to a home dedicated to his condition. I havnt seen Dad in 6 years, i wish i had, thats the problem with emigrating to the other side of the world its a lot harder when somthing happens to family back home. I'm in two minds wheather i should go an see him, Pete said thats it would be a shock to see him now, or should I just remember him as he was.
