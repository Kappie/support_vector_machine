They have this huge section describing the  urlLink foreign variations  of the TV program around the world.  No, I'm not a fan of the show . I was reading up on it because of the scandal known as  urlLink The Charles Ingram Affair .  Anyway, I found the description of the Russian version of the show particularly funny:   In Russia, the show is called Kto hochet stat' millionerom? (Who wants to be a Millionaire?). Here, the 'Ask the Audience' lifeline isn't one that the contestant would often use because the audience often gives wrong answers intentionally to trick the contestants. The biggest prize here is 1,000,000 Russian Rubles.
