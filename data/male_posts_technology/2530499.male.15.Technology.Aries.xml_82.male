It was just two posts ago that I believe I spied a "because"...and then oh look!!! On this very New Post Sheet...an automatic italicized Because.... And before that it said...BEEJ CONTROLS YOU!! USE RED HAT!!! and thus I have reached the conclusion that BEEJ uses red hat, which I have reached the conclusion allows admins to put whatever they *insert obscenity* feel like.   Aye, JDIS!!!!   Pshaw.   "Because LINUX USERS SUCK!!!!! :D:D:D"
