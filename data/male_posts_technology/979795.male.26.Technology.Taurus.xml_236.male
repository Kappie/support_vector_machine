I look at my stance in Aikido, I feel like I'm preparing myself for an attack either this way or that. For instance, when I'm in right posture, I'm basically expecting an attack to come at me a certain way. And when it doesn't, I get all mixed up and everything just goes out the window. I suppose the form probably refers to something more metaphysical and mental.  I noticed Steven Seagal has a stance in which he stoops down a bit and relaxes both his hands. In some scenes, he has his hands fluttering all over the place so quickly I can't even catch what he was doing. I guess, that would include a distracting element to someone who's attacking you.  I for one would love to learnt how to achieve his style of iriminage. Bam bam ... and nage would be on the ground already.
