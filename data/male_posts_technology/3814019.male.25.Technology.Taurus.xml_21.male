The aforementioned Mister Willis is renowned throughout the lands for his uncanny ability to produce a truly random word (thankfully I have never asked him to think of a password). So, having spent the weekend void of motivation I called upon his mighty services to send forth a word, any word, that could trigger an eruption of creative lava that would pour down on my Pompeii-esque screen of emptiness and err, well it would kill it surely, I mean have you ever seen lava rip through a town? Hold on, I am straying here. Sorry.  And what was the word he shot at me without a seconds thought? "joviality". I had to mentally dust off the section of my brain that stored that word and still I doubted its meaning. I resorted to dictionary.com just to make sure, and all my fears came true... I have to write about being cheerful and happy. goddammit its just not fair.   Being happy is for other people, it makes me inwardly happy to see  other  people happy, I can be inwardly cheerful when I see something that amuses me but I draw the line at holding a gun to my body and forcing it to follow suit. You see, my body and my mind go way back, They haven't seen eye to eye for some time. The mind is forever willing but the body, alas, is unable. I gave up trying to persuade it otherwise, it has its own agenda and seldom bothers to include my mind in its plans. So next time you see me walking down the street visibly slouched and looking like I had the winning lottery numbers but had inadvertently wiped my arse with the ticket, then forgive me, I am really quite jovial.
