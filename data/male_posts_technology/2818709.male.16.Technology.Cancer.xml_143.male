For you non-knowing people, i suggested that we hang miss swagerty's knight from the ceiling, and leadership class did it. Cause i wouldnt have the chance to. Yah. Word to your mothers. There will be more pranks today, but i dont think any will top that. herm...what to do? I WANT to do something to stephens. He deserves it. But what? What could we do...  Here's MY ideas:  1. Get conatser to "fire" him on the basis of sexual harassment to otis chodosh. 2. Hang all of the lab stools to the ceiling. I have NO idea how we could accomplish this, because we dont have enough rope/time to do it. 3. Kill him. It wouldnt be funny, but it would be good. 4. Turn all of the tables upside-down. 5. Dont go to class. 6. Steal his chair.  ? Someone say something ?  Other pranks:  1. Dont come back after lunch. 2. Get the security guards to arrest the entire student body...they wouldnt do it, though. They hate us. 3. at 2:00,  everyone freeze. Just stop moving. Don't say a word, dont move a muscle. 4. Everyone go to the wrong class, and act emotionally hurt if they tell you to leave.
