I will be moving to San Antonio a couple of weeks before that where my fianc√©e, Rosie Bidana works for Pape-Dawson Engineering firm.  Right now there is not much going on in my life, except for the wedding and work, but I am looking forward to getting married and living with this truly incredible woman.  I am working on customizing a 1966 Volkswagen Beetle.  I will have pictures of the before and after once I get it finished.
