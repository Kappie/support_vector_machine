I feel this unseen thumb pinning me down with logic and security, keeping me from going out, taking the unsaid dare.  I wanna say  'FUCK IT'  and  'FUCK YOU' ......any path clearing method that will spark and enliven. There are no strings holding me back except said security.  But summer is here, in the city that lives and breathes this season.  How can anyone think of leaving at this time?  Hell, I know me, I'll pocket this until the turning of the leaves, and hope to gain the understanding that is necessary to make a leap.
