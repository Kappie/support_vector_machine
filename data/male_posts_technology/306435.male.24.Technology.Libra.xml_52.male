That is a fun plave and they had really great snacks.  Then wew went up to Dana's and got there just in time because it soon got packed.  Saturday, I finally got my Ohio Drivers liscense.  It was fun taking the written test.  I was in between two 16 year olds and they were freaking out with every question.  I hadn't studied at all, but I know my skills from the SAT's came in very handy.  I think they should teach SAT taking skills freshman year in high school so everyone has a better chance at passing the driving test...  The lines were long and boring, just like on television, which is weird because I had never had that problem in Jefferson County offices.  Saturday night we watched the football game next at Ann's next door neighbor's house.  They had a mixology chart and were all about making mixed drinks for everyone.    Today, Ann and I went to a multi-faith Church Service downtown.  It was pretty cool.  I felt like I was in the churc scene in Blues Brothers and expected full out dancing and flips, but alas there were none.  OH AND GET THIS...No PPV at BW3'S tonight...WHAT UP WIT THAT?  Evidently there was a contractual problem with WWF, Direct TV or BW3's...I didn't stay long enough to find out, the wings are good enough to watch free wrestling to, but not to stay and watch pre football shows.  That is all I have for now...
