The 8pm class is starting to look better with 20+ people playing most weeks and the quality of the players being very high. I finally managed to break into a sweat tonight when I played with 3 of the other regulars (a grand total of 8 tonight).  That 8pm class looks a lot better; ... but I reckon I need to upgrade my racket ;-)
