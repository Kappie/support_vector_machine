Otis came over for a while...we went and flew kites...he picked up on it a LOT faster than chris. By the end of the run, he knew what he was doin! He was crashing and recovering at the end...very nice. Then we rode to super cao nguyen, and otis discovered the goodness of passion fruit green tea. Mmmm. 140 grams of sugar a bottle. tasty.
