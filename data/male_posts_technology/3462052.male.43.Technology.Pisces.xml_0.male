Groups came and went and I guess still do to this day. The games and releases have changed, but I think pre-internet it was much more exciting. Novell and the SBA were routinely trying to get on our bulletin boards. Was always fun keeping them at bay.  The Social Engineers from Europe always trading software for hours on some poor shlepps calling card. Dialing up to all the boards to trade.    The group wars between INC and THG. They were always a pisser. INC courier would be uploading the files to The P.I.T.S and The Slavelord would be hacking out the nfo file to say THG released it and we'd be upping the same file to all our boards with THG stomped on it just to bust chops. Fabulous Furlough would clean up their cracks anyway, which 1/2 the time didn't work.     I had a ball!  Pie
