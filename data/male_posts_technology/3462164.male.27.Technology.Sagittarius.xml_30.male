They will keep resorting to more primitive means of warfare unless something is done. I've been thinking about this for a long time, and I have an idea. Let's send them videos of our own. Instead of beheading them however, let's feed them pig! Wrap them up in pig skin, shove pork chops down their throats, etc. Everytime our troops kill these savages in a firefight, perhaps they can cover the bodies with pig. Perhaps their friends will think twice before shooting at us, because if they die, their 72 virgins won't be waiting for them on the other side. Their last thoughts as they die should be of despair, knowing that they won't meet their god.
