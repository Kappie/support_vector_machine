I think it's very safe to say everyone had a good time.  The evening ended a little sadly though - which is unfortunate.  I believe his name was brad - he made the mistake of waving his hands around and taking out a light bulb. All that was left was the aluminum screw bit - don't really know what happened to the rest of the bulb.  Anyway - I had been having pretty good luck at fixing things even though I was drunk - a real technical guru. My CD had fallen off the tray inside the player and was blocking the tray from closing. I took the mother apart and fixed it - right on - I rule!  So I thought I'd apply the same technical wizardry to the light fixture. Having done the same thing with many a Christmas light socket - I thought it would be a breeze. Surprisingly all the tools were quite easy to find in Julie's garage.  So I busted out the needle nose pliers - we were working away at this thing - I say we because there was 3 of us... Kyle, Justin and I... we were doing pretty good - getting the thing out in 1 mm pieces.   Now it's my turn again - only I'm slightly blind (need to eat more carrots) - so I start ripping away at the aluminum part of the socket - big mistake - see it all looked the same to me... now the thing is totally destroyed.  We (Justin) cut off the socket - and left the wires hanging there. In theory it should be really easy to fix.  All things aside - Julie, if it costs more than $34.10 to fix let me know.  Now all we have to do is hunt down big handed Brad...  Funeral services for the light socket will be held at PMSS - with the reception to follow at the Barney this Thursday...
