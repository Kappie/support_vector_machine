Here goes:  Only In Dreams - Weezer  From what  I  can see, our gereration is a generation fo dreamers. Basically, everyone claims that they have something that they dont. I.E. - "My uncle works for the CIA."  "I got a 35 on the ACT". I, for one, am tired of the damn lies. Be yourself. Don't pretend that you are something that you are not. I hear a constant stream of BS flowing from people's mouths wherever I go. - The one exception to this, is Dani. I'm not going to go get mushy, cause that would be kinda off topic, but, she doesnt bs me all the time. I admire that SO much it's not even funny. Back to the rant - I am an honest person as much as I possibly can be, whenever I can be. I'm not saying that I'm a saint, cause everyone fucks up somewhere along the line, but at least I try. My life has NOT been all that great...but it hasn't been all that bad. Just...average. Out of 46 people in our grade, I'm ranked 26th as far as grades go. Average. On my PSAT (Doesnt matter, but ok...) I got a 46 in math, a 51 in writing, and a 48 in writing skills. Average. I'm fscking DYING to find something that I'm good at. I'm (contrary to popular belief) NOT that good at video games. I'm NEVER the best person at a game...and I use strategy guides cause i'm a perfectionist. Sides, being good at video games isnt exactly appealing in the job market of today. I'm going to do something. Something that sets me apart from the swarm. Another thing that pisses me off. When people complain about grades 90% and up. STFU. It's an A. They dont give a damn about your number grade on your transcript, they just write down the letter.  So, if you could, I'd like to know what i'm good at.  E-mail me...I would tell you to put it in my tagboard...but I forgot where the code was to put one in.  Thank you,  Nick. (not frankie)
