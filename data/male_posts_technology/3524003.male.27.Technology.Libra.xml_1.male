Dreaded to go to work now..thinking about the user's problem is enough to make my spirits real low...Nothing much happen during the work hours, still cant resolve the user's problem...Went for classes after work, but it ended early, so I guess it wasnt that bad. Besides, my BRO came and fetch me... He's going to parkway to play pool, so I went with him. Just then, I thought of my dear,and asked her if she wants a ride back home. She said okie, so I dropped my BRO and drove to novena to pick her up.Once I picked her up, I had the most fun and enjoyable car ride with her.. Think I'm really missing her alot...Went to Bedok for makan,and send her home. Went to Parkway, played a few rounds of pool and went home...Long day for me....
