All eleven players infact more than eleven (left nehra)...    Regarding yesterday match. The sachin's catch was the turning Point I guess... What a catch man... WoW..... Even sachin was enthralled with his efforts... Inzi was in such a great form that his bat in his hand looks like a spoon giving all the balls the direction he would like....   Any way it was a good effort from the team and our maharaja ganguly was also very happy.. Hope they do win the test series ;)
