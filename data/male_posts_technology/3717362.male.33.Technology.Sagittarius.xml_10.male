Willie Williams pled "no contest" to charges stemming from a recruiting trip to UF.  The result is one year's probation.  Except, he was already on probation (and has to see a judge about how this matter might have violated that)!  This is the guy that has a police record of some 10 arrests!  And the 'Canes are apparently fine with this.  Just shows you that most of the time we work hard to earn the reputations we get!
