I watched American Idol last night.  It's not so much that I like to watch American Idol as I don't have a washer/dryer in my apartment.  Therefore I must use my friend's washer/dryer, which comes with an evening with said friend who happens to be obsessed with the show.  It's a small price to pay to not have to use a public facility.  In fact, this friend is so obsessed with AI that he is participating in a pool to see who can pick the order in which the contestants are dismissed.  It's sick, I know.
 
 Anyway, American Idol is not the cause of my bad mood.  The coffee is.  Knowing that coffee has caffein, and being perfectly lucid to the fact that caffein hinders my ability to fall asleep, I chose to consume a cup of joe and paid the price.  What was the price?  Negative three hours of sleep and one groggy afternoon.   "It looks like someone's got a case of the Wednesdays."
