I thought Xbox had full screen AA, so I'm confused as to why the jaggies are so bad.  It's especially bad when selecting your car before the race, but its all throughout the game.  Very fun though regardless. I hear the Xbox Live multiplayer mode is where its at for this game, but I don't see how it'd make the game that much different.
