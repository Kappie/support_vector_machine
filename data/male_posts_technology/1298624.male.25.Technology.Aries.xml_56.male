It's as if you remember that it was another Rose Parade, another cold night where you had to put on two pairs of socks so your feet don't get frostbite. 2003 (while we're still in it) came and went like the wind that blew a horrid life into the flames that torched Simi Valley. Now, after thinking about the blur of a life past this year, December creeps up on us. The end of a year that knew no length at all.   Of course, this is all hooked on to the fact that maybe we were all so busy, we could not stop to just...stop. Stop our lives to see what's around us and appreciate those things for what they are. To look at the person beside you and know that...time can stop for just an instant and when coupled with the ability to recognize this halt in time...I think this is where you find beauty in almost everything around you (except the blantantly obvious choices: death, destruction, famine, you know, those things). The air that you breathe, the sky that becomes blue after months of smog, the wind that lets itself known by whispering between trees. I wonder if other people ever think of this. I wonder if the people whom I see on my daily commute to work ever think about the beauty of the world around them.   But, oh well. Mostly everyone is so preoccupied with their own lives to notice the things around them. I know I sometimes am so absorbed with what I'm doing that I completely zone out of what's going on around me and focus on a certain thing (usually videogames). The question is "Why?" I don't know why.   On another note, you'd think that from a population of 3500 employees at my company, YOU'D THINK that the majority of them would be smart enough to remember a password. Sure you can go on vacation and isolate nearly everything from your mind, but jesus christ, a password?! Almost everyone in the company called on Monday (after the Thanksgiving weekend) to recreate their network, mainframe, siebel, NICE, ADRMVR, 3r/AWD, whatever passwords! I mean, it's not that hard to remember something like that right? Do you become so used to your job that you remember nothing else?! Why is it so hard to remember something that suppose to GET YOU IN TO WORK! I wish we could tell these people that it'll cost 5 dollars off their paycheck (and into mine) for whoever FORGETS and/or LOCKS OUT their user account. Hah! Let's see how many calls the helpdesk gets NOW! I bet our call volume would go from lots to almost nothing! Why...How....I just can't believe it! I would really be happy if they instituted this policy of paying to reset a password. They should do it with EVERY password-protected system accessed by people everywhere. "Oooooh forgot your password, that's too bad, 5 bucks from your paycheck and you get a new one specified by ME!!!!" hahahaha!   Oh, and lawyers seriously do not know ANYTHING about computers. It's as if they spent their whole lives learning how to argue that they can't type one single word. In fact, they argue with me all the time about what they supposedly did to "fix" their problem. Now I know why lawyers are so hated.
