I'd also like to wonder where everybody disappeared to on friday night(?) suddenly it was 1.30am and everybody had vanished - again: Custard, Baity and myself were the last um guys standing: not like certain other people who have confessed being vomitous on friday night or saturday morning!  So have I proved myself 'male' enough to be accepted?! I have blatantly proved that I can drink as much as the rest of you, and don't suffer from the 'cinderella' syndrome which afflicts some of you...  I await the replies with eagerness..
