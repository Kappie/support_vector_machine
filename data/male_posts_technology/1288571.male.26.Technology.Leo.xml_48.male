I just wanted to say a quick thanks to everyone who's joined the forum so far, and props to those of you who post and make it enjoyable and fun for everyone else.  If you haven't joined yet, now's the time!  You can either click the forum link up above, or just click  urlLink right here .  Thanks guys! (and gals ;)
