It was 2:30 in the morning, Vince and I were wide awake, bored and thought of nothing better to do but to seek for herbal mood enhancers. Mind you, I really don’t do this often. Just wanted to get that out in the open before anything else. Anyways, we step outside his house just to face the cold gust of mid-June summer. (Why is it so friggin’ cold still? You call this summer, goddamnit!?) We light the baby up and each take a slow drag. We laughed mindlessly, spat profusely, and talked hysterical non-sense. As we sat there and did our shit, we encountered a strange bunch. (Maybe not too strange, just a tad bit)   1) Huff, puff and away  Some old man, walked up to us and said “D’ya haaave ay sheegarit” in an incoherent slur. In translation, it meant “Do you have a cigarette?” which is a simple question in itself. At that moment, I actually thought he was speaking some Japanese dialect. To this we just shook our heads and kept our mouths shut. Mystery man in dire need of a smoke left never getting his yosi . It was only when he walked away that we noticed his slight limp.   2) All in the army  Next, was this Chinese (?) middle-aged woman walking “military style” with arms and legs straight, raised to the heavens. Ok I’m exaggerating about the ‘heavens’ bit, but really, you could almost hear the ‘left, right, left’ chanting in the background. How can a person be so uptight and rigid, when you think you're not being watched? (Well technically we were watching her, but it was done discretely) Anyways, who are we to presume what kind of stuff she's got in her head. It just looked fuckin’ weird.   3) Melons, I swear    Another random man passed by, this time with a more bizarre-looking walk then the other. If you could see the picture, he looked like he was walking with melons in his hands. He just happened to grip it in the oddest way. This low-tech graphic doesn’t even capture the strangeness of this man’s posing.  Now that I’ve written all these down, it actually doesn’t seem as funny as it did before. When you’re stoned, even the most mundane things become hysterically amusing. But this was nothing compared to the events that were to follow.  Once we were done, I jumped off whatever I was sitting on to get my feet back on the ground. A miscalculation led me to a clumsy fall, as I thought I was jumping at least 3 ft. high when in reality it was more like a foot or less. Dumbo me… After that display of stupidity, I slid my toes in my slip-ons and was ready to go, when suddenly, felt the most yucky, slimy substance in my shoe. I yelled, punched, kicked Vince and accused him of spitting in my shoe. Then I hopped on one foot and quickly made my way to the room to get that mysterious gunk of my foot. As I threw the shoe off, a slug flew out and landed on the floor. How horrible!! In the next second, I dashed to the bathroom, opened the faucet and was desperate to erase that slimy feel off my foot.  As Vince recalls that moment, he said I had turned into a woman in rampage. I was throwing stuff at him, intensely pressing on the shampoo bottle and scrubbing my foot sooo hard. When we got back to the couch, that snot-like slug still had the will power to move 3 inches from where it landed. Man, that stuff was  DISGUSTING!!  The word 'gross' doesn’t even come close to what I experienced in that few seconds. 2 weeks has passed, but I can still remember the texture of it through my socks.   HATE HATE HATE SLUGS!!
