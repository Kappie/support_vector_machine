Law...I also ADORE St. Elsewhere, which I think they show on Bravo.  I love Matlock, but I can't really deal with Diagnosis Murder...it just tips the cheesy scales too much for me.  I also love Remington Steele and Scarecrow  Mrs. King...Bruce Boxleitner (sp?) + Pierce Brosnan = a double dose of hot!  And of course Columbo rocks.  How can you not love a man who annoys his suspects into confessing?  I also really loved that cheesy mountie show, Due South, when they were rerunning it on TNT.    I'm sure there's more, but I can't think of any right now.  Jesus, I watch way too much television.
