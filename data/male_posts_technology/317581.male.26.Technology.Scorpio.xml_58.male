God weeps, for the hell we make and the hell we live, This silence overwhelms me, coming from my soul, A cry, dear God, can you hear me?  The servant that cannot live without you, I feel so alone, will you not comfort me, like you did so long ago?  GOD!!! I'm here, what is it that you want from me? All the bullshit I see, this can't be what was intended....  can you hear my silent screams, though they never come?
