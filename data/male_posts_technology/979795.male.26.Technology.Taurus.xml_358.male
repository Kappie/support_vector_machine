Got kinda sick of retrying and trying to remember my comments then.  Found a job at last. Multimedia Educator with an elearning development company called  urlLink AskNLearn . It was all pretty rushed because everything was confirmed last minute. I'll be attached to Katong CHIJ Primary as a content developer for the teachers there. I'm to update and put up elearning content for the teachers according to the curriculum they tell me I think. Anyway the Principal and teacher in charge wants to meet me on Tues 8am first. Pay's 1.6k for 1st 6mths probation and there'll be an increment later (how much exactly will depends liao). Think the school also rushing now coz Feb has started and they're still not done yet. Haiz ... a lot of clashes. Actually arranged for the Salvation Army to come my place collect stuff the same morning, now I have to rearrange. I'm hoping I'll get some time off to prepare myself for the job and settle my own stuff first. But I think that's going to prove difficult. My impression is that they needs things done urgently so I may at most have 1-2 days of training with the company first and then I'll need to go to the school liao.  Yesterday was my first mob briefing as a reservist. Spent the whole morning in camp listening to stuff I had already heard when I was still serving NS. A lot of things about teh stupid reservists around me sometimes. Some of them bring their 'civilian' mentality into NS and I absolutely hate that. They say things like "I will complain, must complain, etc". I got really irritated hearing things like that. Obviously after ORD these are the ones who have forgotten what it was like during their NS. Once you are back for NS matters whether you don the uniform or not, you better jolly well behave like a damn soldier and not a civilian. Suspect these are the chow geng kias during their NSF days. Some of the new/young reservists also feel that after ORD, they are considered 'king' lah, 'untouchable' lah by SAF or something. Dead wrong, they obviously haven't seen many DB cases for reservists so far. I've personally seen a group of reservists being handcuffed together in a string just awaiting the MPs to come pick them up. Worse case is for no reason/some stupid excuse on their part, they now need to disrupt their professional and personal lives, get their heads shaved, and enter DB to serve their sentence. In fact, the MPs were nice enough to give a certain 'discount/offer' that if we had 10 or more who needed to be sent to DB, they'll provide the manpower and vehicle to come and pick up the prisoners themselves. I really never see the point why reservists sometimes do all the knitty gritty things to avoid their liability, if they had just finished things in the first place ... Anyway, after the brief I had a nice talk with my RSM and he was willing to act as my character reference (though he just knew me for 4 mths).  After the mob brief I was supposed to meet Lynette and then we'd drop by to visit Daniel. Suay thing was my timing got kinda messed up and she spent a long time waiting for me. Got scolded by her over the phone which was quite well-deserved. Anyway I did a lot of walking and when I got to Daniel's they became quite sympathetic because I was wet with perspire. Had to take 2 cans of green tea and a huge bottle of plain water to cool down. If it was anyone else, I'd be so embarassed visiting someone's place so wet with perspire. But with Daniel, aiya ... hahaha, Anyway his gf, Charlotte, was there as well. We all had a good chat and departed after about an hour a half. Almost had to meetup with my NS friends to get a housewarming gift for one of our kakis the next day. Was really glad it was cancelled because I felt really really really tired today. Felt like knocking out when I got home but dinner was to be served soon, so I pretty much made myself stay awake, finished dinner, called the company to settle some details before I could finally went to bed. Woke up damn early today and realised it was Feb now.  New Yr and CNY has been over for awhile now and it only made me realised I did waste some time in the past 31 days or more. I'm glad I had finally gotten some backlot moving, things like clearing stuff for the Salvation Army to pickup and volunteering with the SPCA. Some other things I'd really like to do is visit my NP lecturer, Agus, before I start work soon. Some disappointment I felt is that I didn't get into SPF. Even worse I've heard of news saying that they might have closed applications for Senior Officers for the whole year. I'm thinking I won't give up yet, but I'll still keep my options open for now. When I spoke to my RSM, he had mentioned that even the SAF have their vacancies filled up pretty tightly now. Seems like they now have a pool of people enough to last the next 3-4 years. Just imagine, if the SAF can afford to be choosy with their applicants, it'd be worse for the other uniformed service isn't it? I'll try to check up on CNB side as well though.  Weather seems great this mornin and it's still early to avoid the traffic. Think I'll go for a run now. Time to resume marathon training liao. Just another thing I had put off since CNY coz of the wet weather then.
