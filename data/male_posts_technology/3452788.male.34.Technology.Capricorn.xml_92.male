It was nice to have other people in the house for simple fact that it distracts Anne from sitting and thinking about the other night (OK, she has Big Brother also) so I can ruminate in mental isolation.  Still have thoughts of self-inflicted pain, but more emotional rather than physical.  After reading W. Styron's short book on his depression, I keep thinking about where he says he improved dramatically in a hospital just because he was in a structured environment where the only demands placed on him were to feel better.  Sounds great, if I had a boatload of money and could afford to take off work and have no demands, I would have done it long ago.  If was considering suicide (I'm not), I can see the need for supervision, but unless I win the lottery, that will be a luxury I cannot afford.
