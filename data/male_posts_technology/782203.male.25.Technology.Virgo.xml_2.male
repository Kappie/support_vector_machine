There was a time not too long ago when i couldnt wait to see or talk to her, i thought abt her all the time. Now all she seems to do is put me down , tell me how irritating i am or how sick she is of me .....I wish i never met her ....But anyway she is out of my life for good now , and vice versa. Only thing i have left of her is the book she lend me, its gonna be a painful reminder of what i went thro with her everytime i look at it.
