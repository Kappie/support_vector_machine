Do you truly feel  no  remorse?  Do you ever feel guilty for what you've done? For what you're doing? Can you really push through that blindly, not caring that so many know who you are?  When you read this, are you reading because you  care ?  Are you reading this because you want to know if you still have sway? Pull? Power?  Sadly mistaken. Mind games have not been played on anyone's part but yours.  Believe what you want, and force others' hands, not mine.  For this force is stronger than you will  ever  be.  EVER.    These are not riddles. These are statements. Riddles ask questions, and there are none to be asked but 'Why do you do this?'    For a second I wish the tide Would swallow every inch of this city As you gasp for air tonight  I'd scream this song Right in your face if you were here  And I won't Miss a beat 'Cause I never Never have before   Strong arms will turn weak Those eyes will fade; they already are. Dulling into gray, into darkness Giving in to what thrives  You feed carelessly Ever wonder If you've met a wall You can't break through?  That you can't knock down? Ever wonder if there is a mind that does not waver? That this individual can  fight ? Ever wonder if you'd encounter a battle that you can't win? A battle that uses no physical might?   You ruin the best.
