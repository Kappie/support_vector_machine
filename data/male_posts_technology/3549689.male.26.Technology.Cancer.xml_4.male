There are sites where you can sign up for a lucky draw to get invites. Online communities are full of people requesting, begging and pleading for a GMail account invite. And there's a whole lot of noise all over the place about GMail, and tools for GMail. I even saw a site put up by this guy who wanted to test how long it takes to fill up his 1GB GMail account. It took him  urlLink a little over a month .   With overflowing webmail accounts limited to as little as 2MB, one does like the idea of having a 1GB webmail account which won't expire when you change service providers, leave school, or leave your company. Aso, now that 7MB mail of my friend's wedding photographs won't choke up my mailbox.  But, as I keep trying to explain to people, a 1 GB mailbox is the least of the reasons to go for a GMail account (Specially with the likes of Rediff and Yahoo increasing their mail account size limits). The features that Gmail provides, makes it almost as user friendly as your desktop email client. Yahoo, Rediff and Hotmail don't even come close.  Of course, a lot of the fuss about GMail stems from the fact that thought free, it is not available to everyone right now, and having an account puts you in some kind of elite group.  I got my GMail account invite from a friend without trying too hard, but a lot of people are looking for an account to be able to choose their favourite email address.  billgates@gmail.com  was among the first to go. An email address with just your first name (like rajesh@gmail.com) is among the more popular reasons to get an account early. I wonder why anyone would want to do that, though. I think people with just their first name in their email address are simply asking for mail that was intended for someone else. Inspite of having a hotmail email account that is made up of both my first and last name, I keep getting mails meant for other Rajesh Advani's. There's one in Boston, one in Dallas, one in Canada, one in Ivory Coast, one in New Jersey, and lord knows how many more. People keep congratulating me on my newborn child. Considering that I'm not married yet, that is probably not very good news... I now prefer email addresses that no one else is likely to want. Keeps my mailbox cleaner.  For those wanting to know how good GMail is, I think the answer is that it's pretty good. It's still in Beta though, and so it needs some tweaks, but overall it's better to open a GMail account than one with the standard email providers. And those of you hunting for invites, I'm sorry but I have none. :)
