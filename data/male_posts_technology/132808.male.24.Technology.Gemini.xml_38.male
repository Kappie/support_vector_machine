I got my Tax Return today, and am planning on getting a membership to Wellness Institute.  Someone should join with me.  We can get to building some of that extra sexiness for the Summer months.  Wes, I'll even pick you up after I'm done work from your new home.  Yes, I'm fully aware of what you're saying right now Shane: "How much sexier can you get than Winnipeg's Sexiest Man?  How sexy do you want me to be?"  Trust me, you can never be too sexy.  Unless you're Right Said Fred.  Big-time congrats goes to the Sayas boys!!  Congrats on the new basement.  Sleeps 2k4, cause when it's on motherfucker... then it's on!  My jacket?  What about the fact we went from going INTO a building, to being outdoors?  Hilarious...  These are the words to live by - "Good, better, best: Never let it rest, until your good becomes better, and your better best."  Wow, I think my testicles walked out on me after that one.
