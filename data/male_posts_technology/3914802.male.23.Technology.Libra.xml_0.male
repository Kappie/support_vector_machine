I really like anime (as well as pretty much any cartoons, although there are always exceptions) and  urlLink Otakon  is the anime convention in my area.So far it isn't going well, the pants I am having made for my costume are too small (yes, a costume, *sigh* I have been a geek and a dork for ages though). This is what happens when you get custom tailored pants and they don't have them ready until the day you are going! I am going dressed as  urlLink Great Teacher Onizuka  which is currently a favorite of mine.He is a funny but inspirational teacher who used to be a motorcycle gang leader. He is 22 and still a virgin (although I am 23 and not a virgin, I think I might forget how to have sex soon tho! it has been a year and a half!) and wanted to teach high school girls and hit on them but ends up teaching middle schoolers. Anyways, he kicks ass. He has this one tattoo on his arm in some pics (which just says "greatteacher Onizuka" in Japanese) which I have been having some trouble to write on my arm. I figure a pen then some marker oughta work! It is hard to write on one of your arms though... especially in Japanese. The fake earrings I got for my costume are hard to put on as well and I might just use some Elmer's glue to put em on ;-P getting them off will be another story though. I already had my hair cut and dyed to look like his.. man, it seems like I am going all out for this! At least my hair is the right color. I came to the conclusion with one discussion with my friend, K (who is my roommate as well), that if you are going to dress up then you might as well go all the way. Thinking outside the box makes me realize that it is silly to dress up this much for a weekend convention, but it is kind of fun to do. I have so much to do today! I must buy beer for tonight because I am staying at a friend's place in Baltimore. My friends J and E live not too far away from the inner harbor where the convention is. I have to pick up my friend T who is travelling with me to the convention, and had his license revoked for too many points (dumbass). At least he gets it back on the 16th! I guess some of his points are coming off. God damn, I hope I can stay awake, this waking up at 5:30 shit is killer on Fridays. Guess Red Bull is in order for later ;-P
