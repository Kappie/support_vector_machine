My friends screw me up, my enemies love me and at the end of the day i rather give a gun to the enemy than a friend. Trust me never trust a friend to show up when he says he will. And when he has your hard drive and your DVD drive then never trust when he says hw will get them to you.  Remember life means more: Friends are not people who get you your hard drives and DVD drives it is like a ton of weight that is un----necessary. Do your own and collect it if you want.
