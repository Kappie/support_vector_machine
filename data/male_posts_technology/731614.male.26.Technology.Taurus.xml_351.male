Boz said that Bridgette Bardot was the subject of the Beatles song Norwegian Wood. That may be a rumor (there are several) but the one I heard was that it was written about Natalie Wood whom he met on a chance encounter while in Oslo Norway in late 1964.  Don Larsen of the  New York Yankees  pitched a perfect game in game 5 of the  1956 World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers .  I had the quote "we dont need no stinkin badges" as coming from the movie   Magnificent 7   Roger McGuinn's full real name was  James Joseph Mcguinn .  I didn't elaborate as much as Boz did on Dino's death, I merely had  Plane crash air guard   And admittedly, I had  the Monkees  down as the author of the Grand Ennui and not specifically Mike Nesmith.  I actually did a term paper on  Pete Gray  while I was in junior high school (that's middle school for you youngsters). I knew that he only had one arm.  I knew that Ronnie Reagan was the first president to live after being elected in a year that eneded with zero because I remember being disappointed that he broke the chain. (I know, it's harsh, but it is true.) Also, another cool fact about Ronald Wilson Reagan... The letters in each of his names has 6 letters. Thus, 666.  Most answers were relatively easy to find on the internet and the few that I didn't know I was able to get from  urlLink Hawspipe  quite quickly. Not only do I use him as my attorney, I also go to him with my tough questions.  So... Perhaps my comment about having all correct answers was a little overblown, but I did have them right according to my sources. And really now... Do you think that I would actualy lie to you?  Ha! Take that Boz!
