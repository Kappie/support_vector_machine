And how is it they kill in this method? Either way this song is such a cool jazzy song. I bought the Traffic Greatest Hits album and this song wasn't on it. The CD had room. Why not include it? Later a new Greatest Hits was released and it was on there. The song runs about 14 minutes. A long song. How many long songs are there worth listening to?  My list of long songs worth listening too: The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys by Traffic (about 14 minutes) Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin (about 14 minutes) Freebird (the live version) by Lynard Skynard (about 14 minutes) In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida by Iron Butterfly (just over 17 minutes) Thick as a Brick by Jethro Tull (about 40 minutes {both sides of the album LP}) Paradise by the Dashboard Light by Meat Loaf (about 10 minutes) Baba O'Riley by The Who (about 10 minutes if you can find that version) The End by the Doors (about 8 minutes)  I am sure there are more but that's all that come to mind right now.
