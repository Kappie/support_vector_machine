We may then be able to sort out our hospitals or provide more funding for police and things. Or with some of that money give it to the warn torn countries to help their people directly rather than sending them all here. They annoy me, I walk around Croydon and I feel uneasy. Partly because of the hoddlums around but partly because of them. I know they've come to start a new life etc... I know their countries may be war torn etc... but there are other ways of helping them. Soon Britian won't be Britain anymore.  Send them all to France. Let the French deal with them. They are a big enough country. That or at least make it a lot and I mean ALOT harder for them to get into this country.
