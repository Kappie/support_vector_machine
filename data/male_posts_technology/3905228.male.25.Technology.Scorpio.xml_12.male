"Y do God put one to face hardship"  Then one day I got a spark when I visited the Jewellery workshop of my Dad's friend.Actually hapened to watch the transformation of gold to ornament/ Jewellery.  Even the gold u get in the first case is actually the end product due to fine tuning of various extraction process and even after that gold is subjected to Fire to make it more tensile and durable.  More the fire test, purer the Gold   I got the message, Human might be gold but in the living process he might have some impurities added to him / creaped on him due to his nature or by his surroundings , hence he needs to face the hardship to make gethimself pure, it is the purification process for human.  Now I know why I shud face the hardship coz I know whatever state I'm and whatever i'm , only the purest form of me can survive this process.  I'm will not be worried about the hardship I face, I'm happy about the degree to which I'm getting pure.  Now my heart is light, I feel a burden has moved out of me, I know y I shud face this pain and I know purest of me 'll survive this pain.  It is the pain to make me pure, "No Pain No gain!"  "Y didn't this strike me in the evening"- How come I've completly forgotten this.   Thank you God, Thanks For reminding me about this and making me realise that U r there always for me
