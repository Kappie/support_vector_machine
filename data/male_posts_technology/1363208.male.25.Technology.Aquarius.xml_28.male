At the same time, I almost have no time to think of what to write here. There're times where I just log in, as if I were about to write something but in the end there's no output at all.  Life's been fair.  Yesterday, I worked like a cow; from 9am up till 10pm.  That's lecturing alone. Not counting the meeting that I had after that.  My first thought was :  tired   I was tired untill I knew inside the new LSA class I was teaching last nite, there were four OSS users (Linux/FreeBSD). That rejuvenated me.    I went to KL last Saturday. Wanna know my comment?  STRESSFULL!  Hopefully I won't be living in KL later on. Imagine, just to take a U-turn, I had to travel for miles!
