However it is not nice refreshing cool air. It is warm stagnant air. Our AC is broken. So I called the landlord. I told her my AC thinks it’s a heater and needs moral support and perhaps a psychologist. She told me that she will call SOS again. So I wait and wait. I wait for an hour. Where are my SOS guys, my large staff of people that are just waiting to serve my every need and whim. Where are the people who show up before I even know I have a problem? No where. I call them. They tell me that perhaps they can fix it by next week. They don’t seem to sure of themselves. I ask them why? Perhaps they need moral support, I will defiantly give them moral support to fix my identity challenged AC. They say that some things need to come together. Like what? What kind of an answer is that? ‘Some things need to come together.’ Do they need head? Who do I have to blow to get my AC fixed?  Last night was the worst. I enjoy playing EQ. It’s my lifetime goal to play EQ for an entire night, from kid asleep to kid up time. Oh yeah, that’s my life. Last night however it was 90 in my house and 70 outside. I couldn’t hack it. Perhaps I wasn’t strong enough or maybe my biological needs of fresh air and cool breezes out weighed the health and welfare of my group. I felt bad yet when I went outside for a smoke and felt the sweat that was rolling down my chest and in between my boobs freeze in the cool night breeze and I actually shivered. EQ didn’t have a thing to sitting on the deck outside reveling with nature.  Akcron -- Ziggur! Wait for Backup!!
