Of course in that case quite a bit happened that day, its just that he did not know about it just yet. Did that make him a clueless ruler? Of course not! I mean, he was a man of his time and he certainly found out as soon as technology allowed. It was obviously no fault of his own that he did not know that Cornwallis had surrendered.  But he was nevertheless quite a clueless man. I mean, he did not pay attention to what was going on in areas he nominally controlled. The fact that the Revoluntionary War even had to happen indicates that. And its not like England lost everything. Though there are times I look at our little band of "slave owners who wanted to be free" and realize that the beginning gives flavor to the situation that never really gets lost from the preparation. So maybe clueless George gets a last laugh for all the craziness that was eventually inspired....  Sometimes I wonder about the company for which I work. Theroyaltyseems to me (who is fairly close to the bottom of the pile) to be kind of out of touch with the situation, buying themselves bread and circuses. And maybe I am wrong here (the disadvantage of being near the bottom!) though I do not think I am. But in the meantime I will keep hearing about everything that happened today was important, assume thats what is going in their diaries, and wonder if they know what has been happening lately?  As for me, nothing important happened today. :-)
