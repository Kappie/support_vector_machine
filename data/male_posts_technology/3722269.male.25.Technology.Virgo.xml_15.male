PC crap is long past its use by date. We live in a world where we cant call jobless bums and bludgers, bums and bludgers, fags arent fags, homos or dykes, cripples are now 'differently abled' and stupid people arent 'morons' anymore they're some other righteous crap. Fuck it. Ima stick to calling things as I see them. What pisses me off is people that are against one form of prejudice or segregation while blatantly contradicting their point of view on another.. it's fine if you wanna be all high and mighty and say that all people should be created equal, but it wont change the fact that people -arent- all created equal. They never will be either, give or take genome cloning.. but thats a different matter alltogether, right, back to my point.. If you want to treat people indifferently because of 'race' then you also have to be prepared to treat people indifferently regardless of their varying levels of comprehension or intelligence because it'd be just as bad not to, right? Now we also cant treat people differently because of religion, sexual preference , body odour, social habbits (or lack thereof), sexual fetishes, personal hygeine, anything.. absolutely anything.. this ideal politically correct world, would have as all walking around treating everybody the same, regardless of EVERYTHING. It's not possible. if we were being completely politically correct, we'd not treat wheelchair dudes differently to able-legged normal people, so out go the ramps - you can haul your scrawny wasted away carcass up those fricken stairs and act like the rest of us, mr differently abled! or is the solution, that the rest of us should all get wheel chairs, and meet him on his level that way?  Rah. The whole thing makes me angry. I'm wildly intollerant, and unjustly so, I unnecessarily persecute people for being stupid. I admit it. For some reason I think people are more in control of not being a doofus, than they are to say.. not be cripple. I'm ok with my fault. I wont treat a guy in a wheelchair any differently to a guy standing, I might be wrong in doing that, but I figure, its either that or spend my life wrapping everyone in cotton wool. This isnt the deep meaningful rant I was indending on writing, but its at least a vent.. I'll write a more reasoned thought out version later, if I get around to it, for now, I'll cook dinner. Gnight.
