Not recommended.  So we got through the nurses ball unscathed, me with my napalm throat, Custard with his gammy ankle from attempting to exit Le Follies via the roof, and Captain Kirk with his ever present cybershot camera of doom.   I know I am getting old when I start reading through the JEP and getting angry. Like the front cover last night, I think it was Frank Walker and Terry somebody.. giving it "Bright Future for Jersey".. er.. hello? Is this island still called Jersey? This would be the island that is going through a major employment drop and companies are throwing staff out like Michael Jackson with babies off hotel balconies.  States of Jersey, wake the hell up! Almost NOBODY I know my age wants to stay on this craggy island wannabe for the rest of their lives.  They can't afford a house, they can't find a decent job and they are tired of the government wasting money on bullshit projects that do nothing but rip-off the local people.  *cough* sorry about that, you know I go a bit political every now and then.  I think I am due for another one of my pills.  G'night kids.
