It's one of those movies you can see time and time again and not get tired of it. Too many darn commercials on TBS though.  I bought a digital camera on Friday - maybe the smallest digital camera I've ever seen. 1.5 inches by 2.5 inches. It's called the "SmartCam Mini V". I don't know who makes it - I searched the Internet for "SmartCam mini" and came up with  urlLink only 4 matches . So it's one of these nondescript Taiwanese manufacturers. But it's a hell of small camera. So far so good. I've taken a few dozen pictures with it over the weekend, and it's pretty good for the size and price. Not exactly film-quality -- maximum 640x480 resolution. But it fits in my jeans pocket without noticing.  We have a Chinese mall up here, just North of Toronto. Man, you can buy anything there. One store sells both clothes, and dried noodles. I am not joking - clothes and noodles in the same store. Of course, some stores are devoted to Hello Kitty merchandise. I don't get that, but to each their own I suppose. A few weeks ago I bought a tiny remote control race car there - 1 inch by 2 inches, that's how small it is. This place sells some cool stuff - cheap. It reminds me of  urlLink Stanley Market  in Hong Kong. Kudos to  urlLink Pacific Mall  - that place rocks.
