I didn't do it, instead I spent two days in school catching up on textiles work and it is looking pretty good.  I now also hate Ken Livingston. Always have really. This whole thing about 4 by 4s. There is no problem with owning one. They are lot more comfortable than some cars and yea so they are big?? So what?? They don't actually take up more space its only because they are taller. Its actually handy haveing a jeep here as there are some roads around here they actaully help getting around on. Everyone has the right to choose. Banning them are going to create so many problems. I know about the stats saying about if you get hit by a 4 by 4 you are so and so more likely to be killed because they are higher but in that case people should just be more careful. The majority of jeep owners are older people who have been driving before and so know how to handle the roads senseibly. Ugh that man annoys me so much.
