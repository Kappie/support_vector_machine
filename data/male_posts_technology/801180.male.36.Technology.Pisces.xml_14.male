Well this weekend never really took off, because Jo was ill on Friday night so we had to stay in rather than go out as planned for my birthday.  Fortunately she was feeling better on Saturday, so as the weather was good, a weekend of jobs in the garden was started.  Unfortunately along the way I managed to reverse into a neighbours friends car - not much damage was done to their car, just a crease in the front wing, and no damage to the Freelander - cos its tough like that!  It still means that an insurance claim is likely to be made though, which is a pain in the proverbial, as the insurance is just about due for renewal - sods law!  Well we managed to get quite a few jobs done, made a new concrete path at the front of the house, and nearly filled the hole created by me taking up the patio the other week.    Even better this afternoon we went to a nice pub, that was also child friendly -  urlLink Half Moon, Windlesham .
