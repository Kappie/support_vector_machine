Poi pa gid! hehe :) Now I have combat attack for SARS! hehe  Edmar: Gani man, you're gonna learn how to sing when you're doing it for God. :) You should hear Gemma's singing  career  story... hehe ... kun pano sha ka-reach sang high-flying falsettos nya ala Charlotte Church! haha (Pati Gem, galing kay tuod man gid, CC always come to mind when I hear you! :)) Oh, you had piano lessons gle? Cool! :) Ako man gani before, pero feeling ko di man ko gifted sa music! hehe Congratulations again sa imo and sa shoti mo yesterday sa baptismal nyo! I'm very happy for the both of you gid. :) I forgot to ask you, when's the exact date of your treatment gale? Naka-schedule na? :) And Neil's right, that could really give you time for reflection. God bless gid. :)  Neil: Techie? Define "techie" please. hehe I'm not either, long way to go pa ko da ya! hehe Mauna na ko da ya lakat sa 3, sila pa sa 5th! hehe Kun tani may pa-istar ka sila Neil dugay na kami ara da! hehe Oh yeah, grabe gle busy sa school ka noh? Pero I know you can do it Neil! Kaw pa, I've always believed in you. (Wow! Compliment #1, lista sa notepad! haha *joke*) Cge lang pag kayod sa Phil. Lit., that's one of my fave subjects here galing kay inyo ya in Filipino gid. hehe  Ahh, we can't promise you anything Neil. Pero I know God is working gid sa youth ta subong! I can see changes, miski jutay lang. :)   Hmm.. not necessarily sa blog, but writing in general. Ok, how was I sure nga ma full-time ko? I asked God for a confirmation. Many weeks before sa THE EDGE nga camp, I was really praying hard about it that I coud hear God speak to me. Perhaps you could recall, if you were watching closely sa amon ni Isis and Gigi, and not to forget, Gemma, sa likod pag consecration night... Pagtawag sang Lifetime Dedication, I didn't have any drive to move forward. Isis started to cry when I told her, "Full-time na gid ni ya... " I actually joined her pero I came back to my senses and realized I shouldn't be swept away with my emotions (I actually laughed nga amo to gin ubra ko kay nadala ko sa iya hibi`... haha) so I stood  straight in front of Ptr. Dave sa likod nayon, when he was calling na for Full-time dedication.   I could remember that I asked to hear "GO" ... because a few weeks prior to that sa discipleship namon  nga prayer, ang verse nga " Go  and make discipleships of all nations ... " (Matt 28:19) came to mind. So during that time sa dedication, I was struggling to go forward and backward again, as though ... ambot, indescribable! hehe Basta, I knew at that moment I was called gid, I heard "Go, go, go, go ... " in my head. And when I went to the front, I felt peace, peace that passes all understanding, it's like, you just know when you know. hehe  Remember ko gd ara ka to sa una naga-smile-smile while playing the guitar! haha  And yes, I had doubts before that, that's why I asked for confirmation. And also days after that, those questions bala, "Basi ako lang to ya ..." Galing kay we know how the devil likes to feed us with lies. And when we know the truth, it sets us free! :) Now, I'm excited about sa BSOP na conference because I know I will be learning a lot gid didto and once again clarify kun Full-time or Part-time: Which Are Thou? hehe Pray for me pls. Hmm.. how about you Neil? :)  Also don't worry about it, na realize ko nga amo ka gd na ya gale, most endearing trait (hehe) and I learned to accept it. :) Apology accepted, and I'm also sorry for ignoring you sometimes cos d ko pa na chindihan before eh. Although sometimes you can be REALLY IRRITATING! haha I'm looking forward to have lagaws with you guys too! hehe Gusto actually nila Rosan  Co. kadto sa Enchanted, ambot lang kun may time pa na  ... basta lagaw mo gd kami Neil ha! :) Problema lang nila is pano transpo pakadto sa Pasay (building ni  Achi  B) from UECP, then mag go home na, Pasay to Pier -- dilemma! Sigh. That is kun ma stay sila kay  Achi  B, pero may gin offer man to kanday  Khuey Amah Hong Giap So  na bata, sa may Greenhills daw, pero d pa sure cos 4 lang maka-sleep sa bed and others will be in the sala na daw. hehe 7 sila tanan mag-stay for lagaw, +1 = 8 (that's me! hehe)   Wow, grabe, SUPER LABA na gid ni ya. Sorry fellow Ramdom Ramblers, I'm sort of making this my own blog na! hehe God bless your week y'all! :D
