Earlier I was worried about hearing the news of Sonia (Gandhi), the Italian Born Indian Citizen heading to the premiership. Me being an INDIAN Citizen (INDIAN Born) I was reluctant to accept her as Prime Minister. Now I appreciate her stand for stepping down to accept the post.   It was known to everybody that Manmohan Singh, the former Finance Minister and author of the post-1991 economic reforms and, admittedly the cleanest man in Indian politics. WE believe that Our country will be safe in Dr. Manmohan Singh's hands."   Hope INDIA will continue shining and grow in economy and Information Technology.
