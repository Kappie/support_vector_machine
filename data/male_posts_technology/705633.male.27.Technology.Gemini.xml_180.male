Sorry all but I am a bit annoyed with the French. More so than normally, My digital camera got knicked from the Hautlieu 50 anniversary meal held at the Hotel de France by a bastard European waiter who walked off with it after clearing up the napkins at our table. I suppose the 500+ people helped hide his larcenous tendencies and I literally only left it there for 30 seconds!  oh well, Scratch one Digital camera. Silly Grockle, cant even sell it on easily with a broken display screen, no cable to connect it to a PC (not even a standard size) and no software.  Serves the bastard right for stealing from me!
