I had a dream last night that I forgot to write a paper for one my history classes and I wasn't going to be able to graduate. But then I woke up and realized I'd graduated like 2 years ago:) Whew.  Also, kevin and john and I are looking for a place to live and Jebe is back in town so all these things are going on. It's actually a great time to be alive:)  Catch you on the flip side- T
