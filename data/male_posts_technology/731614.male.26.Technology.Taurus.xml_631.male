Residents of Plumstead's North Branch development need not worry about the yellow-brown water that may be coming out of their faucets. It may not look pretty, but it is not harmful, a township official said.   Since receiving a couple of calls last week from North Branch residents about the color of the water, the township installed a filtering system, the effects of which should have been seen this past weekend, according to interim township manager Dave Nyman.   Meanwhile, residents could continue to drink the water and bathe and wash clothes in it, Nyman said.   The wells in North Branch, which supply the public water system, typically have high iron levels. The levels are not unhealthful, Nyman said, but they can cause water to discolor.   "There's nothing that's harmful. We're looking to make it prettier," he explained.    For our public service project this week, I think we should help the people of the North Branch development by telling them what that stuff is that is coming out of their pipes.  I shall start.  People of North Branch, that substance coming out of your pipes is: 1. the rinse water left after Belle bathes her monkey...... 2 .condensation from Boz's breath after he has been drinking Jack Daniels.... 3. the water Jonnie wrings out of his swim suit after a dip in the pool.... 4. ......
