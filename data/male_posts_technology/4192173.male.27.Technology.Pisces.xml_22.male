This morning, via IM, Jamie and I review and discuss. We're on the same page, which is good. Because of the time difference, Jared will respond later. Almost there. Meanwhile, Jason's father in law, Russ, who is an excellent songwriter and a dynamic guitar player, came in to Cracknation to play over a Chemlab song called "Force Quit". He laid down a KILLER guitar solo that takes the song up to a new level. Russ comes from that Lennon/McCartney school of songwriting and guitar playing and he understands the ins and outs of a song. The stuff he plays swerves through this song like a bird. Well done and kudos to Jason for bringing Russ in.  A rough version of www.hypefactor.com is back up and running. I have some new designs for it that should hopefully go up soon as well. Brandt should be appearing on here soon to give more perspective to all things Hype.  I refuse to discuss my utter dislike for THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN. Anna Poontang is responsible, though I would have seen the movie eventually. I'm dying to see PIRATES. Hopefully I won't be disappointed.  Back to the mixes and then a mogpac reunion..at a retirement home. ;-)  F
