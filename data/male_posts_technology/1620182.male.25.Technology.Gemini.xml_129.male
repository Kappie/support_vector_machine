I met Ken at his swank apartment in McLean and we headed in to a bar called Blue Martini in Georgetown. The plan was to meet up with Mike C, Christy, Chris, and Kuang, who, being who they are, were over an hour late.
 
 This place was just recently written up in the  urlLink Post  as being a kind of lounge where a young, hip crowd sip on martinis and listen to pounding electronica. I found the description to be largely accurate, but the crowd was a bit strange.
 
 The place was small, with a few low lying tables scattered throughout. Ken and I grabbed one despite the bogus sign marking it as reserved. The din of the electronica made conversation next to impossible, but we struggled through it. My voice is suffering for it this morning, though.
 
 Mike C and the gang eventually made their appearance. I'm not trying to get on their case for being late as they had a much more logistically complicated journey than I. I just think it's funny that you can pretty much bank on this group running anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour late.
 
 Mike was standard Mike, uttering his usual "you are the man" type philosophy to Chris after downing a few blue star martinis. I can't say marriage has changed him that much as he and Ken spent a good portion of the night studying a nearby "latin woman" (as he liked to call her) shake her barely covered rear.
 
 So upon getting Mike completely trashed, we headed over to Johnny Rockets to get some burgers and allow Mike to completely berrate Chris for "not getting laid by the latin woman." This type of conversation lead me to wonder if Christy will ever let Mike go out with his fraternity friends again. We'll see.
