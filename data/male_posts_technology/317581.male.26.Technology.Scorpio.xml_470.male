I need to tear a little bit. I need to live. I need to breathe. I need to move on. I need to not obsess. I need to let go. I need to go away. I need to cry. I need to hold out. I need to not rebound. I need to sleep. I need to interact. I need to read. I need to engross myself. I need to find passion. I need to be cool. I need to be strong. I need to not cry. I need to be me. I need to grow. I need to be me. I need to find me. I need to not sigh.  Torn-
