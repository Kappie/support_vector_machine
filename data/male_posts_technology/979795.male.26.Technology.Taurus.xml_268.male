Has anyone seen the NUS Aikido website? It looks really good now. Much much better than before, and definitely way better than even their associations homepage.  Talking about new websites, the SPF has a totally new and kewl look too. Was checking out the recruitment page when I saw the new look. They even have a link for the STAR (Special Tactics and Rescue) Team. My only beef with them is that it takes longer to download now. First of all it requires plugins like Macromedia. After that it takes time to download and travel in between links (ie. Loading xx% etc).  OK talking about the SPF reminds me of my NS. I got my official notice to resume service on 18th Aug. Just occured to me that I'm not exactly sure how to travel there and the time I'm suppose to report. Think I'll need to call CPC for the unit no for all the details.
