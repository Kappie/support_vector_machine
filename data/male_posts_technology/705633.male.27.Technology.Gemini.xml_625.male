Snow here has been fantastic - managed a twisted ankle on day one and a major stackage involving flipping over today in front of lots of people today (got cheers from the people around me).  My younger sister also gave birth while I was away!  Little Holly was 8lbs 15oz and my sis refused all drugs and gas to later quip that women make a big deal about childbirth.   Have come to the conclusion that Pas De La Casa consists entirely of bars, clubs, ski shops, restuaurants and shops that sell giant car stereo's.  I'm no economist but that hardly seems sustainable.  Have drunk far too much although still not much compared to some of my brothers in arms here.  One of them managed to get kicked out of a club last night after an incident involving a bottle of water and an attractive local girl :-D  Right thats about as much as I can type on this damned French keyboard with half the letters in the wrong place.
