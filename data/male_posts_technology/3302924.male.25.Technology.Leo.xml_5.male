Recently installed this Mozilla offering on my PC and found it a very good option beside MS IE. Yes I mean it. I have made it my default browser too and use IE only for sites which are still very MS centric in their design. It seems to me that IE has long back stopped evolving (Check out what  Joel  has to say on this -  How Microsoft Lost the API War ) and options like Firefox can provide with many nice to use features for easy-browsing.  Some of the features that I like about Firefox: > Tabbed Browsing: So you can view multiple pages/sites in a single window. Thats cool! > Popup Blocking: Now this would be bit of anonyance to lots of Advertisers. > Themes, Themes and more Themes: You got that. > Google Search: So if you been using Google Toolbar, don't worry they have for FireFox too.  Cons: - I have found this to crash a couple of time, but even my earlier IE used to crash quite often.       - I am having some problem with my drop-down menu. Not able to get the position correct. But also havn't spend much time to check that out yet.  Do comment on your experience with FireFox. I would really like to hear from you.
