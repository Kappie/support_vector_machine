Here is a snippet I never heard of before, which I thought was quite interesting:  Brazil is considered the leading success story in the developing world's battle against HIV. Brazil offered comprehensive HIV prevention plans from the start of the epidemic and, ignoring the protests of patented AIDS drugmakers, began distributing copied versions to HIV-infected patients in 1996. In Brazil's own analysis, the payoff has been: 90,000 deaths averted; a sevenfold reduction in AIDS hospitalizations; and savings of $2.2 billion.  The whole article, which is about the potential of India to turn into an Africa, is  urlLink here .   UPDATED: A  urlLink link  about World Relief at the AIDS conference.
