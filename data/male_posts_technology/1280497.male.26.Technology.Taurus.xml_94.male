Stanley is great, arching his back and getting mad during the day, but sleeping pretty well at night. He makes eye contact and coos. He smiles and seems to enjoy contact with us. I feel like the King of Spain whenever we have a little cooing conversation, regardless of how silly I undoubtedly look when I'm leaning over him, making cheesy smiley faces at him and emitting falsetto chirps.
