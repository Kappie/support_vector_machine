The Wall Center practically glows in this fantastic indigo blue when the light hits it correctly, and it makes a brilliant contrast to the lighter blue in the sky.  A jet's passing has left some fluffy white contrails, parallel lines floating in an east/west direction from the airport towards the mountains.  As I walk through the West End, there are still some cherry blossoms left; stragglers who have resisted the urge to fall to the ground below to become food for the incredibly green grass.  The heritage houses along Bute street stand at attention, various colors trying to stick out from the pack.  Yellow, green, blue, white, natural wood grain...they are like pageant contestants, all wearing the white sash of a low picket fence, strutting their stuff for me.  Some have had enhancements; tall flowers, the fragrance somewhat sweet against the smell of the grass.  The road itself stands out in stark contrast; a black band thru a sea of color, it's honor guard of spruce, fir, cherry and nut trees standing at attention, swords raised.  As I reach the hill above Robson street, the various less organic colors and sounds there start to show.  The orange of steamrollers' awning, the blue London Drugs sign with the dark green Earl's roof.  A boom car goes by, some silly little ricer thing...12000 dollars of bright red honda with 14000 dollars of ground effects and muffler, the subwoofer working hard as this small person overcompensates.  The crowds are relatively light this time of day, but I decide to just cross robson anyways, heading down towards Coal Harbour.  As I near Georgia, the blue green pastel of the Hotel Vancouver's multi turreted copper roof comes into view.  The gargoyls all salute me as I walk past, wishing they could un-entrench themselves from their guard posts.  The roar of Georgia's traffic, across the street I see that one old apartment building standing out like a rebel amongst all the monster condo hi-rises.  One piece of organic brown and rust, this little 5 floor building defies all the black and blue glass of the expensive condo's around it, daring them to try and move him.    Beyond, as the hill moves down, I see coal harbor.  The esso boat gas station guarding the harbor against invaders.  A float plane takes off, roaring past the end of the park to fly over Lions Gate bridge, astounding the drivers with how close it seems to the suspension wires.  I cross Hastings and decide to turn left, walk towards the park and back up denman.  The condo's here are a different sort than the ones on georgia...less spartan, more green comes out here.  Not just the greenish tint to the glass, but the large lawn area's and the greenery on the tiers of some buildings.  To my right, I pass the little harbour with the big boats; quarter million dollar and up yachts of the ultra rich mixed with the small pleasure craft or the somewhat less rich.  The Coal Harbor community center pops up like a periscope; the round roof just slightly above the ground level from this side of it. Some kids on BMX bikes are working on their skillz, curb hopping and wheely-ing away.  The cannon sits sheltered in it's cage, a monster waiting for it's time to shine at 9 o'clock.  The Vancouver Rowing Club building is its usual bustle of activity; some event seems to be happening on the deck and if I was going that way I may try and crash and munch on a barbequed burger.  But I'm not.  I reach the start of Stanley Park and turn left again, through the tunnel under Georgia St.  Roller bladers whizz by, some skilled, some looking dangerously precarious.  Up the hill past Lost Lagoon, the fountain is off right now.  The geese are about, though, and that white bird way over there might be one of the swans.  Of course, it might also be a seagull...it's hard to tell from this distance and he's cleaning his wings so his neck isn't up.  It's always a treat to see the swans; their graceful lines and movement a nice change from the gawkiness of the geese.  I stay on the path for a bit so I don't have to worry about crunching on goose shit, then decide to head out of the forest up to denman street.   I leave the shade of the trees, the smell of the fir needles, the crunch of the red gravel path for the smoothness and fragrant air of the west of denman area.  The nicer part of the west end, I tend to think of this area as low-rises and medium rises guarded by tons of flora.  The building managers around here must all be gardeners, because flowers are king in this neighbourhood.  The holly branches abound, the bigger flowers stand at attention.  A few bees buzz around, and one can hear the birds singing softly here.  I reach Denman streets bustle; on a hot day like today denman is busier than robson.  I walk towards second beach and the other entrance to Stanley Park, and the crowds get bigger.  The Bread Garden patio is packed, as is Death By Chocolate's.  The Denman Place Mall seems to be a hub of action right now, people running into Shopper's Drug Mart to pick up sunscreen and an icy drink.  The bikini store has a few people inside, and I ponder how busy that store can actually get.  Do people actually go to the beach very often without a bathing suit and then decide they need one?    The water on English Bay is a slightly different color than that of Coal Harbour.  A tinge lighter, with more whitecaps as it's less sheltered.  There are a surprising number of freighters parked out there today, and a surprisingly small number of sailboats.  The freighters seem to be at attention, the cranes all pointing the same way and in the same stance.  Most of them are riding high, so they are probably waiting for approval to go into the port and load up with stuff to take back to Japan, Hong Kong, San Francisco.  The few sailboats out strut their plumage like mating peacocks, flitting around looking for the best wind.  In the distance I see a kite surfer (I gotta try that some day) jumping waves along spanish banks.  Burrard Bridge stands majestic, it's yellowed sides and rounded girders a classy piece of engineering history.  I've always found burrard bridge to be sexier than Lion's Gate because it looks so classic.  Plus it's a heck of a lot easier to get across.  Back up Davie St, towards my house, the uphill climb begins.  The crowds down this far are all heading somewhere; some to the beach, some home like me, some just down here to do their shopping at the safeway or the LD.  The macaroni grill sits serenely, this magnificent stone building with it's fantastic lawn seating.  A few couples are having a romantic lunch on the lawn, I'm sure the building is pretty busy inside as well.  I turn down Nicola st and go up one block there, then walk the final two blocks home up that street.  I pass the movie star rental place and glance at the windows, wondering if i'll see any famous people today.  No...it almost looks empty actually.  Often when people are filming in town they will rent a suite in that building; perhaps no one is filming right now.  Or their filming and at work right now, which is very probable.  I go through the back door to my complex, check the mail and head home, another nice walk on another nice day in my city.
