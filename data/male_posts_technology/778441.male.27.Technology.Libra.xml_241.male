He said that if such weapons were found on Syrian soil: "I'm quite sure we would have to respond to that". [link via  urlLink Metafilter ] Mr. Richard Perle, I think you and your idiot pretzel-fearing boss could do better by using all your resources to try and find any proof of those WMDs in Iraq first. Warheads with  traces  of nerve agent don't count if you are trying to justify invasion of a country.  So, before you talk about  doing an Iraq  on Syria, first attend to the business that you've left unfinished in the last year or so...  viz.  finiding Osama, finding WMDs in Iraq, etc.  And if anyone thinks this is an anti-American view... think again! This is just an anti-idiotarian view!
