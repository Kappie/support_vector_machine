You take the daughter of a convicted mafia kingpin (and her family) and give them a reality show. Let's reward crime, yippie!  I'll start by stating the obvious.  urlLink John Gotti  is not someone anyone should admire. He was your basic lawless thug, with a touch of ambition and humongous ego. He started as a mob enforcer, which means he threatened people, beat people up and sometimes killed them. He committed violent crimes for a living. He rose through the mafia ranks by murdering his bosses. He died in prison.  (Incidentally, one of Victoria Gotti's brothers was also arrested for racketeering and is now facing a murder charge. Two of her uncles and one cousin are convicted mobsters. Her husband also has some racketeering and tax evasion charges pending. So it's safe to say she was surrounded by crime growing up.)  Even so, let's not smear the good name of Victoria Gotti with her family's crimes. As far as I know, she has was not involved in the mafia and has not broken the law in her life. She seems to want to distance herself from that life. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt on that.  Her kids appear to be both brats and thugs, which is a rare combination. They need their mother to cut their steaks for them, but at the same time have no problem cursing her out when she says "no" to something. They don't listen to her, and they don't respect her. A lot of fighting goes on, things in the house get knocked over, and the ocassional karate kick into a door. In short, I hate her kids. Seeing them in their life of apparent luxury (and being grateful for none of it) disgusts me. Jack Osborne is ten times more respectful to his parents than these brats, and I used to think he and his sister were pretty bad.  As for Victoria Gotti herself? First we should remember that she executive produces the show. She is the one who voice-overs the sappy narrative. This show is from the first-person perspective - her perspective. There's nothing objective here. The magic of post-production editing can cut the really bad parts out. This is not a documentary.  She starts off by saying people have certain preconceptions about her because of her name. For someone trying to  distance themselves  from the mafia, she sure  acts  like she's in the mafia. She offers a limo driver, jokingly I suppose, $1,000 to dump her blind date in a ditch somewhere. She takes offense to the suggestion that she could not be a good mafia hitman. She spends a lot of time berating a poor construction worker. Of course, he might have been trying to rip her off with his work estimate, and he did put his foot in his mouth in response to a comment she made, but once she got her teeth in him she took a certain amount of pleasure terrorizing the poor guy. He was shaking in his boots (or more likely peeing in his pants) at having offended a well-connected Gotti kid, and she didn't let him off easily.  I'll give her some credit. She has an interesting personality and character that it might (I said might) be worthwhile to explore. She seems driven - what makes her tick? Are we going to see different sides of her? She doesn't seem happy, why is that? Given how the Gotti name is associated with crime, is she doing anything to actively combat that? Is she trying to keep her sons away from that life? There are a bunch of possible storylines here. Only time will tell if any of those things get explored, or if we get the same crap served to us in the first episode.  In short, I don't “get” the appeal of this show. I suppose this would be the reality-tv version of The Sopranos. But watching Victoria Gotti and her brat children makes me sad. I keep waiting for something interesting to happen. But, nothing interesting ever does.   Other reality shows that follow a family or group around have things interesting insights to share with the viewers - The Osbornes, Newlyweds, Making The Band 2, etc. Each gives the viewer some insight into the life of celebrities in various stages of their careers. Ozzy Osborne is an iconic rocker who is now an old man (he can't work the TV remote, how cute?). Jessica Simpson is a young spoiled pop princess, trying to make it as an adult singer (don't offer her buffalo wings, because she doesn't eat buffalo). Da Band shows us how young artists go from nothing to something in a short period of time, and the challenges in handling that (what do you mean I have to work hard to become famous?).   What does Growing Up Gotti show us? She's not actually a mobster, so it's not like this is a real life The Sopranos or Godfather. Noone is going to get whacked. She's a minor celebrity at best (NY newspaper gossip columnist), so it's not a behind the scenes look at fame. There's not much mention of money, so it's not a look at the lifestyles of the rich and famous. What new and interesting insights am I to get here?   The show seems to talk a lot about how difficult it is to be a single mother. Well, that may be interesting to some, but not to me. Plus, I hate her kids, so she hasn't really done a good job of that. For the type of show that it is, a look at the daily drugery of life, they could have picked many more interesting subjects. Donald Trump would be interesting. Mark Cuban. Any kinda-famous actor -- Drew Carey or Ellen Degeneres for instance.  Critics have said this show is a one-trick pony. I suspect that it is. A convinced John Gotti's daughter to do a TV show. And all the king's horses and all the king's men, couldn't make it interesting.
