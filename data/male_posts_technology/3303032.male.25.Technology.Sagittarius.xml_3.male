People who run at the first sign of trouble, but love talking about their own issues.  People who like to point out the glaringly obvious, and call themselves insightful when they, like a drunk crawling through his own piss and shit, manage to string together a sentence between their uncontrollable manic urges and drippingly pathetic self-loathing worldview.  Listen, grow a pair, and get your life together.  Get a job, put the fork down, and learn how to be a fucking man.  Things will go much easier for you when you take responsibility for your actions, ownership for your current situation, and charge of your future.    And the thing I love the most is when people ask "You're not talking about me, are you?"    Here's a news flash, if you have to ask that question, then odds are I AM talking about you.  Of COURSE I'm talking about you.    Last thing on this departure that I hear all the time.  "I'm just dealing with too much to think about that right now."  Guess what?  EVERYONE has shit they're dealing with.  You can define Life as:  Life:     Shit you're dealing with.  Everyone on earth has had it rough (with the exception of President Dubya and his fucking elitist retarded capitalist scumfucks in Washington).  Your uniqueness does not come from the hardships you've had to deal with in your life.  Your uniqueness comes from how you get over it, from fighting through it.  If you're so in love with your hardships that they define who you are, then your balls are nothing more than a pair of atrophied raisins that are no more good to you than your appendix.
