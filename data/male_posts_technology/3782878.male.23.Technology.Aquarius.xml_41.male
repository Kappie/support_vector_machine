I'll edit this post later and give you more info on my weekend.    -edit-  My buddy didn't show up this weekend, dunno what happened to him, will have to call him up and ask him someday, oh well, things like this happen. And sometimes they disappoint me. This weekend was pretty rough, Friday I spent from the time Sammycaine got up, till around 9pm taking care of the toddler. That much time alone with him can be a little challenging, now compound that with a lack of cigarettes till around 6pm, and you have a recipe for a crappy day. The second day I had to get up to take Sammy's brothers home, at 8:30 am, after spending till 5am playing. 3 hours of sleep, luckily I overslept my alarm, got up at 9:30 instead, so 4 hours of sleep, lil better, drove the brothers home, came back home, and kid was crying and fiance was asleep.  I felt awake, I tend to whenever I get up, I just can't get back to sleep once I've gotten dressed and have met the morning. I have to wait forever before I can even think about taking a nap. Anyway so I stay up, take care of the kid until the fiance wakes, SammyCaine wakes around 2ish, says she feels sick, and went back to bed. I took care of the kid until around 5:30 when Sammy needed to pick up her brothers for babysitting duty. They arrived, I got rushed around the house doing this and that, while I wanted to just chill.  Things started to pick up Saturday after the brothers came over. We took off and went to Taco Bell before we went to a movie. I ordered their new 1/2 lb combo burrito(which I will tell you for a fact, was not 1/2 lb!) a beef grilled stuft burrito(now that's 1/2 lb or more!) and a cheesy gordita crunch(nirvana of cheese to me) and a large Dr Pepper. What do I wind up with? 2 of my items, and I'm missing my fave one, the Cheesy Gordita Crunch, they didn't even ring it up, we checked the receipt, the dude operating the register was a complete idiot, and you could tell when I told him my order, and he waffled it twice and didn't repeat it back to me the last time. Maybe he was new, but new people should be forced to work a night shift before being put on rush periods to ensure they know what they are doing before they handle the tough times of the day. Ah well, I digress.  Now my day was still being crappy, missing my fave item in my bell bag, and then I go to take a swig of the Dr Pepper while driving. SPLASHDOWN! the lid was not Firmly affixed to the cup, and thus, I end up with a Dr Pepper Shower, Ice cold refreshment this was not. more like frosty hands of death while I'm driving. I can't help but laugh at that last part though looking back on it. I dunno just seeing people getting the suprise of their life by being splashed with water when they're not looking always made me at least giggle. but at that time it was pretty crummy, Thanks Taco Bell Stooge! missing parts of my order and not putting the cup lids on correctly! you're fired. Okay I feel better.  Then we saw the movie, Spiderman 2, which I will review in a seperate post. Turned my day around, just snuggling with SammyCaine in the movie(Spiderman is her fave superhero, mine is Punisher) just made my life more complete. we drove away from the show later, and I was no longer as grumpy as I had been the whole day. I didn't care that my buddy didn't even call. I didn't care that I had the kid for 2 days straight. We went to the park after, for a lil while, walked around it looking at artwork. then went home, played more Everquest, and went to bed. so it got better, and everything turned out all right.  Try not to feel the stupid people Phoenix
