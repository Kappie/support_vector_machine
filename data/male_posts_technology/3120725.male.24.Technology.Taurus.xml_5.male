Working really sucks, I believe in an Anthropology class I was told, and don't quote me on this, that during the "Hunter and Gather" days of our collective human history people worked an average of 20 hours a week.  Now for all you math majors out there thats half the time we spend working in the present day with our wonderful modern and time saving conveniences.   Don't get any ideas I am no Unibomber(not sure on the spelling), I don't hate technology, it actually pays my bills, but there are times I would like to live in a friggin' cave.
