The project itself was mostly successful. I wasn't able to complete everything I set out (for reasons beyond my control), which was somewhat disappointing. But given that, they seemed to be pleased with the quantity and quality of my work.   So, now, I get to stay involved with the project (which I am happy about), but I don't have to worry about writing a huge report at the end (which makes me even happier).  Now, I can really concentrate on classes, and having a more normal schedule again.
