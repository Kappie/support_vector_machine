The graduate committee for the CS department at my graduate school has agreed that I should get my Masters, against the desires of my former advisor.  I'm glad that it's finally going to get resolved at all, but the fact that it's falling in my favor is highly reassuring.  Sadly, I still have a lot to do before I even think of going back for a PhD, let alone getting it...   But we'll see how it goes.  That may be up the road a little bit, too.
