So I started reading everything, and it was pretty crazy, just seeing what I was thinking/going through back then, and how much I've changed (some for the good, some for the bad). It's pretty cool to have this sort of record of thoughts from back then. I'm glad I saved everything.   On the job front, it's oh so encouraging to see about 15 whole new jobs posted this weekend. Wow... yeah, we're not in a recession or anything right now. riiiighhhtt.
