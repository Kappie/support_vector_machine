And for the most part, the quality is too poor to even warrant looking at them.     But just recently I came across a new website with fan films -  urlLink Batman Fan Films . This site has top notch movies connected to it - some of which are darned close to being studio quality. I think it's worth checking out.     Especially good are the latest two entries:   Grayson  and  World's Finest .  GREAT stuff.
