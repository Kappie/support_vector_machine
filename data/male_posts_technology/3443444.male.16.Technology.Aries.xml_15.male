And because we're Americans, we like to watch stuff that blows up, or thats shiny. So every year, on July 4th, we go down to the bay/lake/whatever type of body of water there's avaliable to pollute, and we go and shoot a bunch of stuff into the sky that just happen to blow up, and are shiny all at the same time. And because I had nothing better to do, I did the same thing as most of the American's today, and went and watched the fireworks (which is crap, because fireworks were invented in China!). Every year (except last year) me and my family go down to the same spot on Highway 101 to watch the fireworks, its a damn fine spot if I must say. This year was no different, me and two friends, Tyler and Jason, walked down from Tyler's house to our famous spot, which was quite the adventurous hike since we encountered Braxton and Kelton along the journey, I hoped to play poker since Tyler brought his brand new chips down there in hopes to find time to play a few games of poker while we waited. But that didn't happen, as we walked (fell, really) down to the beach. And then because we were bored down there, we threw rocks into a little creek down there. And when it got to be a little later, we ventured out into the bay, which, since the tide was out, was filled with sand, and we found a big ass log out there which we were planning on sitting on and watching the fireworks. Until these 3 girls and one guy came walking from somewhere and also came to sit on OUR log! So, they sat down, and made small talk, (this is were it gets exciting!) offered us a couple of beers, and since they were cold, cuddled up close to us, and started kissing our necks and whispering to us....or man, it was like a dream come true...they left their drunk, nearly passed out friend on the other side of the log. It was almost perfect how there were three girls, all good looking who wanted to talk to us, and make out with us, and three of us there (Me, Jason, and Tyler). After a short while, they got a little bit closer to us and starting trying to make out with us, and grope us, and with us being guys, we didn't object to this. After another short while, Jason, with his damn red hair won over ALL THREE girls, and we think that they're all pregnant now....  Ok, so I lied..... Most of what I just said didn't really happen, but it sure does make it more interesting than the real story!   The REAL Story  We really were sitting out on a log in the middle of a bay, and 3 girls and a drunk guy really did come sit on our log, and they did make small talk and offer us beers, but after a short while, they were REALLY annoying, so we left to go out to a big ass rock....about halfway to the rock, Tyler discovered that we just left 3, very drunk college girls, and we made a horrifying strategical error. Because all of what I said before, very possibly could have happened....although highly doubtful....  And Tomorrow, Tyler is organizing a special 4th of July poker tournament! Complete with brand new poker chips bought and cared for by Tyler himself! I had the pleasure of seeing these chips, and oh man, they are nice! So if any of my faithful readers out there know somebody that plays poker, or is interested in learning, please, send me an e-mail. If you forget, thats  urlLink leedeaton@gmail.com .
