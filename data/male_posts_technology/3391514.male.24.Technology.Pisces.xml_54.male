The reason?  I went to see  Thunderbirds .  It wasn't particularly bad, but obviously not up to the calibre of the likes of  The Day After Tomorrow ,  Shrek 2  or  Spiderman 2 .  The CG was reasonable, the plot acceptable if a little hackneyed, the acting unnoticeable.  The main thing that ruined it was the annoying child sitting behind me asking his parents every two seconds what was going on.  I suppose that's the drawback of going to see what is essentially a kids film.  Also went back to  Fallout 2 .  I'm a bit worried about the plot.. it seems to be getting progressively more and more worrying / depressing.  Plus it crashed on me at least twice, and these were game killing crashes.   That  RPG is running tomorrow... I do hope it picks up.
