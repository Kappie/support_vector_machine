While perfection makes perfect, it also might hinder the slow process by dulling my interest after a while.   Because of this:    I will keep the beginning of the process mostly for myself. I'll allow others to comment on what I do, but I will be the entire crew for the time being. I will not start involving other people before I know I want to finish this.  The outline of the story and the game mechanics will be done early, but not too elaborated. I don't want to be entirely alone on this part.  The game engine and making the basic stuff work has the highest priority at the beginning.  When the engine is in place and I've written down how I want this game to work, I can start involving other people and other talents. Primary getting the concept art together, then continuing with involving people eager to make a good game.   As most of the work will be in the interface, the graphics and the sounds/music, I need to involve other people with various talents. Voice actors, modellers, mappers, graphical artist, musicians and writers. I got some names in mind, but I'll leave it for now.  But if you already now know you'll be interested in helping me at a later stage, feel free to tell me!
