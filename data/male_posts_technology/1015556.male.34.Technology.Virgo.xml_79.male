In any case, since it was one of the top albums of 2003, I bought it.  I wanted to buy it used, but D and I bought some other stuff from Amazon and got free shipping.  I'm listening to it now, as I do more reading of Eldredge (the girlies are in bed...)  Eldredge speaks a lot of seeing our lives as epic, and this album really fits the part.  The music is so wide and expansive, listening to it convinces me that I'm integral to the battle, that the hour is desperate, that there is a war going on.  It's interesting isn't it.   The other thing that comes to mind about it is that its kind of a dark record when you first listen to it.  But the words are so heavy.  Our culture is looking for spiritual answers...  Enough that the album sold 3.4M copies...   i tried to kill the pain but only brought more i lay dying and i'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal i'm dying praying bleeding and screaming am i too lost to be saved am i too lost?  my God my tourniquet return to me salvation my God my tourniquet return to me salvation  do you remember me lost for so long will you be on the other side or will you forget me i'm dying praying bleeding and screaming am i too lost to be saved am i too lost?
