In summary: The natural behavior of vole (a kind of rat) is to mate different female all the time.  After a change of gene... the mutated vole becomes faithful... only 1 girl for life.  It's interesting to know that only 5% of mammel has 1 single mate for life.  If human genes can be altared the same way, is it a good... or a bad thing?  Sounds like a good idea to me...
