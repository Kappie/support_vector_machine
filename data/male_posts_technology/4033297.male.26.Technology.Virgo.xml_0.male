Developers' superiorbest,    Nokia'ssmoke the rest.        Although theywork,    Sanyo's have their quirk.        Cheap and loosely fit,    Motorola's are nothing but sh!*.

Slap your face and go home,    It's not worth it over a stupid little phone.        ~ A little late night poetry by Edward An dazed from a lack of sleep.
