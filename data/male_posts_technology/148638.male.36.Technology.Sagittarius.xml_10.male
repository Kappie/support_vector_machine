Being a good admin, I know that the best "point release" upgrade is a full backup-format-reinstall, especially the change-packed releases of MacOS X. Not to mention it's a good excuse to "spring clean" what can quickly become a data-crufty hard drive.  I did the first one this morning - an eMac user with a reasonably capable machine and a fairly vanilla install. All told, from walking into the user's office to walking out, it took about 3 1/2 hours - which included explaining things to a student employee who I'm bringing up to speed on things Macintosh.  The biggest boon was  urlLink Target Disk Mode . No, that isn't when you're in the department-store shopping zone. Long story short, TDM allows a Mac to act like an external hard drive. Take one Mac, hold down the "T" key, and (re)boot. After a bit, a blue screen with a yellow firewire logo will show. You now have a Mac-shaped external firewire hard drive. Use a firewire cable to plug it into another Mac, and it'll mount on the desktop.  Made it easy as pie to made a quick-and-dirty disk image backup of the eMac's drive, as I'd brought along my PowerBook with 25GB of free space. Later, when re-installing the user's apps, I reversed the process (making my PowerBook the TDM Mac) and downloaded disk images of installers for apps like AppleWorks and Office v.X.  TDM is one of those things that drops jaws when you show it in use to another tech geek who regularly has to move gigabytes of data from one computer to another. Certainly easier than the common PC method of removing the HD and installing it as a Slave IDE drive on the second PC.
