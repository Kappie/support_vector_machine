I find the most recent update to the list quite funny (keep in mind, I haven't read the rest of the blog):   "Part XII  I want a big geek.  I don't necessarily mean a computer geek, although those are fun, and it's amusing to think that saying something like, "but I couldn't, because the file extension was .php! hahaha!" is a turnon.  But I like smart guys, I like men who have a clear interest in something, and I really, really like people who have passions - in other words, geeks.  Particularly ones who babble on like crazy about the thing they're into, and then realize they're doing it, laugh about it, and then maybe accidentally do it some more, realize it again, and then talk about something else. Awfully cute."   Links to the rest of the list (I find it quite entertaining):  urlLink Part I  |  urlLink Part II  |  urlLink Part III  |  urlLink Part IV  |  urlLink Part V  |  urlLink Part VIish  |  urlLink Part VII  |  urlLink Part VIII  |  urlLink Part IX  |  urlLink Part X  |  urlLink Part XI   Yes, this lady puts a lot of thought into all of these... hehe
