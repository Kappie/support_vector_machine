One example is of last nite I had dreamt what it would be like to have not had my parents around, another dream I had was of my mother checking my wallet to see if there was any money inside there and my last dream was that I had to pay a scary visit to the dentist. All these dreams I found very peculiar since my parents have been getting themselves into a lot of trouble lately, my mother constantly checks my wallet and my room to find any money or anything incriminating, and that same night I fell asleep forgetting to brush my teeth.     They say our dreams have a superior intelligence in them: a wisdom and cleverness that guides us. They convey to us illuminating insights. They warn us about danger. They predict future events. They hint at the deeper meaning of life. Dreams steer us to an adapted, wise attitude toward life. I have had my fair share of interesting dreams but I cant wait until the ultimate deep sleep to find out what really happens when the brain is no longer spoon fed oxygen from the heart. Is there really a spiritual greater power who plotted us here on the earth? Or do we just stop thinking and are no longer active in the physical world? All these questions and more answered in the next episode of "My Life".     **Ok, well enough of that. I'm going to the gym and I'm going to go walk around Granville island now since I got my unlimited monthly skytrain pass on me. Bye, and sweet dreams!**
