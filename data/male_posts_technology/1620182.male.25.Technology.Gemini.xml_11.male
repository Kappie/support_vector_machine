 Ah, the blissfulness of my old stomping grounds -- the  urlLink University of Virginia .  My how things have changed in the two years since we parted ways.  The grounds (that's campus for those of you who are not  urlLink Wahoo afficianados ) is mostly covered with horrendously ugly red walls, each hiding some sort of new University construction project.  I arrived about three hours prior to game time in hopes of soaking up the pre-game culture for the very first time as an alumnus.
 
 A stroll from the University Hall parking lot to the corner via Lambeth, Beta Bridge, and the Collonades revealed two University icons on their way out the door.  The new basketball arena has broken ground, with the construction project occupying an entire half of the U-Hall parking lots -- bummer for the first years (freshmen).  Also on its way out is the Lambeth scamper...no longer will the students have to play  urlLink frogger  while crossing Emmet street to get to their cars; a walkway over the road is under construction.
 
 Passing down Rugby road and into the Corner area we were reminded of being an undergraduate at UVA.  Dressing up for football games is a popular tradition, and the students were looking fantastic.   urlLink Mincer's  was packed.  We fought our way through the crowd and picked out some t-shirts.  Mine is bright orange with Virginia written across the chest in Navy letters.  We concluded our Corner tour with a pizza from  urlLink Mellow Mushroom  and some ponchos from the Student Bookstore (a wise purchase).
 
 From the corner we walked to the football stadium.  The Rotunda, the Lawn, the Ampitheater, and finally the  urlLink Engineering school ...Mr. Jefferson's finest all passed before Scott Stadium loomed large in our view.  A finer collegiate stadium I have not encountered, though I am obviously biased.  We entered through a gate that did not require swiping a student  ID for the first time ever, and after collecting our thunder sticks, we settled in, four rows from the top of the stadium, for the time of our lives.
 
 Four quarters, 27 points, several electrifying plays, one rainy spot, and one injured " urlLink heisman candidate " later, we departed the stadium happy fans (despite the injury), and headed for the Theta Tau house.  Thanks to a record number of people at the game, traffic wasn't moving, so we decided to head to Buddist Biker for a drink or two.  We walked to the car in the pouring rain, and if that wasn't fun enough, we got within a block of the car before we realized that our keys were still at the house.  So we trudged back to the house (in the rain).  Thankfully, one of my fellow Theta Tau alum was willing to give us a ride back to the car.  We left Charlottesville around 12:30a and managed to be in bed by 2:15a.  Ahhhhh....
