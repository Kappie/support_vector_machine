Interesting to watch the twists and turns of life, just a few months ago we were lads and now of all, we r men and women...   I got a first-hand feel of what it feels to be a responsible "man" and an indication of sorts of how things are going to be in a few years from now.   Long Live Life ...!!!!  Expecting call from Kavi. She might be here by now and into the training hall. Just learnt that their training is going to be in UNIX to start with...   yeah jax, may be u can again send the link to the groups and may be they can have a look at what has been going on and people who are online for a reasonable part of the day can be welcome to be part of us.  Kicha
