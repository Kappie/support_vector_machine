I spent the weekend in Oyster Bay, New York. Hometown of Teddy Roosevelt and some of the richest people in the Northeast. People I met had the following names: Bostwick, CW, O'Donnell, Mouse, Motty, just to name a few. My friend's place was right on Oyster Bay and also had a pool overlooking the Bay. Amazing. Both nights were capped off by a nice glass of Jack on the rocks. That's my new closer. Really caps the night off in style - and in case you weren't already about to pass out, it finishes the job well.   I don't bang enough chicks.   Last night, I saw Dodgeball with Coosi. Horrible, Horrible movie. Never let Vince Vaughn try to carry a movie because he can't -- great side character, horrible lead. Stiller continues his streak of playing the same exact character. His wife does look the best I've seen her since the days of Hey Dude. That said, I can't wait for Anchorman - the Legend of Ron Burgundy. Looks hilarious. Also saw the trailer for The Village - which looks fantastic.   Back to not banging enough chicks. I simply don't. Some people do. Some people don't. I don't. Why not? I'm not a bad looking guy...I'm not Brad Pitt, but I'm not Brad Stapleton either. So what gives? I don't try hard enough? I think I don't make enough moneyadfs;. That's neither here nor there. I think I need a name change as well - Matt Werner just ain't cuttin it anymore. I should either start going by MJ and eating at more steakhouses, or make up something poetic like McFarlane.   Huge series for the Sox tonight. If they don't take 2 out of 3, the race for the AL East is over in June. Thanks Theo!
