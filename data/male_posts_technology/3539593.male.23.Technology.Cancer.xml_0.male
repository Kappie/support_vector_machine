Anyways, much has happened in these first three weeks that needs proper rambling to be put into place.  Let's see...  LARPed over the weekend.  If you are among the vast majority of sane Americans who don't know what that is then shame on you for not opening your mind, broadening your horizons, and all that other uncreative crap.  www.masi.us should give you an idea of what I'm talking about.  So I spent the weekend in the woods, rain soaked, mosquito drained, bruised, bloodied, and shamelessly covered in mud - in otherwords: in absolute bliss.  I find it funny how I like spending a weekend busting my ass for the enjoyment of others better than getting blitzed and hanging out at a party.  I always knew college life wasn't my scene, but it's frighteningly easy to be sucked into believing that it is what I should like, even now that I've gradumutated.
