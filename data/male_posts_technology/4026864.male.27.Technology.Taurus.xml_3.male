Each day I will include a quote,  a poem, something that has hit me.   Today I include this unpublished poem by Denton Welch        Understanding and Fighting      My friend and I      Are close abd blind and warm,     ---Sometimes.     And then we find     All happiness in being still     And know the dark Earth.         But other times     Our hearts are far apart.     No darkness sings,     No stars keep guard;     Only the cruel words are said     And ancient wounds remembered.        * Denton Welch  Denton was an interesting character. He wrote three novels, all of which where autobiographical.   He died at 33 from injuries he recieved when riding a bike almost 20 years earlier.
