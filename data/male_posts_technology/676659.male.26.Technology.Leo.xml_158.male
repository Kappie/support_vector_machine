This is a forward message:  Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ,  My sister in Hong Kong told me there's a recipe for the prevention and treatment of SARS, given by some alleged Divine Source in 1986 and published in a book at that time. I am not going to comment on that source here, but I  do want to share this recipe with you:  Garlic       1 clove Ginger       a few slices Lemon juice  1 table spoon Honey        1 tea spoon  Mince and press the garlic and ginger in a cup, add the lemon juice and honey, then add boiling  hot water to it, mix and brew for a while. Drink and eat the entire content.  Since the ingredients garlic, ginger, lemon, honey and water are all good for health, I feel confident enough to pass this information to you.  The story went that a certain doctor in Hong Kong contracted a severe flu in Jan. this year. At that time nobody even knew about SARS, but she was so severely ill that she thought she was going to die in spite of all the antiviral agents and antibiotics she was taking. Then she remembered the book that she read about the alleged prophecy and alleged remedy, she tried this brew. Miraculously, she recovered almost immediately. However, she has passed the disease to her daughter, so she gave the same remedy to her daughter and she too recovered quickly. Meanwhile, her nurse contracted the sickness too, so she gave that to the nurse and she immediately recovered without the use of any other medication.  I leave it to the reader to discern what this means, to believe or not to believe. You are free to pass on this information, in fact, a friend even suggested that I should e-mail this to WHO, but I don't know their e-mail address, you, however, can do that if you like. Or, if you don't believe it, simply delete it.  As for me, I place myself completely in God's hands. If it is God's will for me to contract SARS and die, I seek not to escape from it. But then, perhaps it is God's will that I should take something whose smell and taste I have dreaded all my life as an act of penance, afterall, we are still in the lenten period...just two more weeks to go. Then again, maybe it is God's will that I should eat the dreaded garlic and still die of SARS, so be it.  Until you hear from the news that all the people in Hong Kong are suddenly cured of SARS and the supermarkets all ran out of garlic and ginger, it is difficult to be certain.  Meanwhile, be happy, stay healthy and smell garlicky.  Kathy Wu IT Support Homes for the Aged Div. (416) 392-2944 kwu@toronto.ca
