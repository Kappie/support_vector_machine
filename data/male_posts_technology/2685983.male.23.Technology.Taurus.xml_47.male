I have to get the CD player out of the wreck of the Camry and then I'm going home for the weekend. I haven't been since before my trip. There was ice on the lake last time I was there. I'm going to show the family all my pictures from the trip.   Tonight  I'm going to see Sparta. I'll go about 9ish. I hope it's not sold out. They were at Coachella but I was too exhausted to get up close to see them so I just wandered back and forth between them and Desert Sessions and bought a hat. I am excited to go tonight though I do love their album and I want to hear what the songs from their new one (out in July) will sound like. I bet the opening bands will be crappy screamo crapo.   Last night  Dean phoned and said that the band was going to meet at The Yard  Flagon for some beer and snacks. I felt bad because I was going to chat with Jenn at 10 but I felt like I had to go to this since it was the first night after the show and I skipped the last two (or was it one?) night outs.   Right after Dean phoned and I was on my way out the door Evan phones on his cell from Lydia's.   he was all like "you're not playing tonight at 10?" "No that was last night" "Didn't your email say Wednesday" "No, but thanks for coming out!"  Anyway, so I went and it was fun. Todd told the funniest story I've ever heard:   this comes from a male nurse (like fokker, y'know) who works with my Todd's wife.  this great big woman came into the hospital. She had a ginormous fat apron. y'know a big roll that hang over. She was complaining about pains. They lifted up her gut and guess what???... They saw a chip bag under there!!!! After that this guys job was to lift up the gut and scrub the infected area everyday.   It does sound like an urban legend to me but if someone is so obese that they don't notice a chip bag under their flesh they deserve to be ridiculed.  They played good tunes at The Yard including Pixies, Frank Black, and Crooked Fingers.  I got my mini-disc back from Dean. He said it sounded like crap. I knew it would. I told them that it should be recorded open air through my headphones but Dean just was like "you.. are gonna... record through headphones????? ..(disapproving look)... are you serious????)" FUCK YOU! I recorded 2 nights of Modest Mouse that way and they sounds fantastic and also some other stuff. All great. I knew that the soundboard would be unbalanced.  well the soundman did get a good recording of the girl playing gone for good on my mini-disc. I'll rip it to mp3 and share with you people, but maybe I should get her permission first? It's really good. Her name is Miranda Roberts.  so here's what it sounds like VOCALS: loud and clear - this is actually my first time really hearing the lyrics. GUITAR and KEYS: goes from between medium loud and barely there. BASS: barely audible DRUMS: very quiet.  Hopefully the mp3s that Dean made are salvageable. By listening to the recording I think it didn't sounds as awful as we thought but we all blame the sound coming through our monitors for screwing us up.  well I talked to Jenn when I got home at 12:15ish. She wasn't really mad at me but I hate to disappoint her like that and she's afraid that I'm pushing her away. I'm not, she's more important to me than anything else. I felt like a shit.   Tuesday Night: The Show   The first guy was just some dude on an acoustic. He was good if forgettable. Next were two guys on acoustics who were all GQ looking. I'll withhold their names but I called them Terrance and Phillip. Totally lame. They played a Jack Johnston song and covered Disarm. One guy looked just like Josh Homme/Craig Kilborne. One guy had a harmonica with headgear and we were wondering if he was even going to play it. Whatever.  Next was Miranda Roberts. She did a wonderful version of "Gone For Good" by The Shins. After she asked if anyone knew them and me and Mike and Dean shouted out. I have it on my mini-disc and I should share it with you all.  We were next. Dean's whole family was there to watch and cheer us on. We got the soundman to plug my mini-disc into the soundboard to record so he went to excessive lengths micing the drums and my bass amp but then gave us shit for not starting. The sound through the monitors was horrible and I messed up the beginning to almost every song and we stumbled through a lot of spots. There were times when we couldn't hear the guitar or keyboard. Last time was fun but this time I was sweating bullets and nervous. I still managed to smile now and then and look like I was enjoying myself and instead of like I was scared to death. Luckily we knew the songs well or we'd be screwed.  None of my friends that I emailed showed up. I saw Duch's friend whatsherface there after but just talked to her for a second. I wonder if Jeff is mad at me for being in this band. That kind of pisses me off that he doesn't come out and support me and see what I'm doing musically. Dick!  Next was a guy named Joey who Mike and Dean saw puke his guts out before going on.  He definetly had a look but his songs were just power chords with only one strumming pattern.  Next they had prizes for the bands. There was a pink thong from Schmata to be won. Everyone at our table was chanting THE DUTCH THE DUTCH THE DUTCH (that's my nickname that the band gave me). The hostess drew ASTERID from the cup and I went up to receive it. hehehe. They said I had to put it on so I put it on my head! Later at the table I signed it. Good times.  Oh yeah and next was the Nickelback Jr. band: Eye of the Round. The singer looked just like Chad Kroeger but with dark hair and stood the same and sang the same. The other guitar player also sang the same. They even had a song where they said "this one is about a small town called Kelvington". It was about how small towns destroy you. There last song was called Ponds or something and they said "we got really drunk and wrote this in 15 minutes" I was like "oh not 5 like the rest of your songs". Fun to mock. I have pictures.  The last dude I saw played acoustic and had a really good voice. He did Sweet Child O' Mine very nicely. But then he started to talk and had this crazy ego so I decided it was time to leave. Loren stayed a little while longer.  (pictures coming soon!)   urlLink asterid.com
