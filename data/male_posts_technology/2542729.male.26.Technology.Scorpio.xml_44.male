You did, however leave out some key information in your quest to call me a liar.  The IM conversation we had the night that you "were officially dumped"...you know, the conversation that finalized my feelings...what pushed me over the edge....what made me fed up.  You don't have to toss sugar on a sour situation or distort it until it's your imitation of innocense gone bad.  Tell it like it is.  Your fans will love you for it.  Tell your readers about how you fronted me last night when I was emotional by acting like everything was all good.  Tell them about how you told me I could count on you whenever I needed you and not even 24 hours later, you're telling me to wait until you finish your thoughts before you "could be there for me" and all the while you were writing this entry accusing me of lying.  DEFINE LIAR while you're painting your images of desecrated innocense.  What did I tell you that was not true?  Nothing.  Did I tell you something last night that I had not told you the night I broke up with you?  Sure I did!  But LIE, I did not.  Like I told you, you can sit on your bum and say a million times that it should have this and it should have that.  I told you the night all was lost, that we had a choice.  Our relationship was not neccesarily destined to end the way it did.  We CHOSE the path and followed one another to the end of the road, only, somewhere amongst it all, I stopped and asked for directions.  And now that I know what I need to do as a person, before I'm ready for another relationship you wanna crap on me?  Isn't it messed up how your entries contradict themselves?  Isn't is curious to your readers how everything you once said I WAS, you just said the complete opposite in this entry?  Your equal...you said I was...Someone who was on the same page as you...you said that too.  Who's truth is the truth? And if you "saw it in the beginning," why would you knowingly waste my time?  The truth is, you didnt know ANYTHING.  The only thing you knew was that I was out of a bumpy relationship and you wanted me.  You had NO idea of how our relationship would be.  If you did, you wouldn't BS me and keep telling me you know we'll work thru this.  Do you really believe half of the things that you try to make yourself believe?  What's the real truth, Ronald?  Truth be told, for all you know, I am what you need, needed, or what have u...but honestly, after reading this entry, I have a totally different look on who you are and your "feelings."
