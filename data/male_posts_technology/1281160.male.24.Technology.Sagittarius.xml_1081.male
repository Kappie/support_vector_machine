And this has been the very root of any astrological theory... horoscopes are mainly based on 12 (if I'm not mistaken) objects that constitute the planetory standings...   Now my question is how does it really get to affect our lives... if at all it does... How does a saturn moving from a left to a right have an impact on whether I would succeed in an exam or not...
