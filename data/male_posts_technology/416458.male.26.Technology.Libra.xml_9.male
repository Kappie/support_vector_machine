You can get the first set of images with it and they will be updating the software over the coming months.  I'm a complete space geek, but I've let it slide over the last couple of years, so this has really energised me to get back into it.  In other news, the holidays went well, although I'm really not quite up for 2004 yet, still too much work stuff hanging over my head at the moment. One good thing thought it that me and the lads are off to the School of Rock premiere with Mr Jack Black himself in attendance, next Tuesday. Now if that's not a kick ass way to start the year I don't know what is! :)
