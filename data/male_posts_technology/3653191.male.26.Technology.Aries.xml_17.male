Narayna Reddy was the chief-guest and was requested to speak after the inaugural of the book. Whatever he spoke, I believe was extempore... and just superb..  He spoke in Telugu and was telling how the word 'yogam' is used in other words... samyogam, viyogam, prayogam, upayogam, abhiyogam.. .and so on and so forth.  There was another gentleman - Mr. Varaprasad Reddy, Shantha Biotech - MD and he was mentioning abouta German scientist has done research on how Indian classical ragas were found to cure diseases and ailments. He spoke so fast that we could not take note of them. I sure will meet and find out the names of the ailments and their corresponding curing ragas..  Overall, it was a enjoyable event. Couldnt stay on long to listen to the cultural programme that followed. Was getting late for home... twas my mom's birthday as well !!  Cheers !!
