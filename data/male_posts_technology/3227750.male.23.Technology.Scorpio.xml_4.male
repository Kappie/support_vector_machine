As I began writing last night, I've decided to rescind my initial promise of updating all of you out there about the events of my life in the last few months. At least, to any great detail. The big events are merely that I'm done with school (finally!) and that I found a job. And (hopefully and seemingly) a good one, at that. =-)  Speaking of work, that's been the second biggest influence on my life since the last post. More on this following the single biggest influence on my life since the last post -- my girlfriend. =-)  She came up for the weekend (well, most of it anyway) after being at home for a few weeks. There's nothing quite like that moment when you and your SO have been separated for even a short while and you get together again for the first time in what feels like an eternity. Having said that, I had a wonderful time this last weekend with her. It also reminded me of how little there is to do here. We hung out in the apartment Saturday evening and went out on Sunday to play miniature golf. CJ started to feel sick, however ( =-( ) and so we returned to the pad and watched movies for the rest of the day, just about. Monday, we went out for lunch and spent half of our last few hours perusing the shops in the all too cookie-cutter shopping area in New Hartford. I won't torture all you single folks out there with any more along these lines.  Work has been going well, lately. Following the painfully disconcerting events of last week, it's been a much needed relief. Most notably, today I was able to successfully demonstrate that things seemed to be largely working and that it seemed that I might be close to the end, barring major catastrophes surrounding getting the last few features to work. The really good news of the day was that my boss seemed happy with the sudden progress in the last few days, getting things to work. The best news of the day is that he talked about using this part of the project in a demonstration to the customer on the 19th...which is a few days after my probationary period ends. It's looking like I'll be able to keep my job again. Yay!  Aside from all of that, there hasn't been much else going on, although CJ's visit for the weekend was wonderful. I only wish she could've stayed longer, but I'm quite happy she's in Rochacha now and well within range of weekend visits. =-)  Less related to what's been going on, and more pertinent to what I've been thinking about, I've been wondering about a lot of long-term stuff in my life since it looks like the short term stuff is all going to pan out for now. =-) Big questions currently include what will happen when Cortney graduates -- where will she end up? Will I be able to follow? Will we still be together? Also, questions as of late pertain to work (obviously) -- do I really like what I'm doing right now? Is there any way that I could possibly like it, if I don't at the moment? Is it really what I want to be doing in 2 years? 5 years? 20 years?  I've decided not to end this post on a thought this time. I'm feeling very uninsightful. I need to iron some clothes and get my ass to bed soon. Good night world!
