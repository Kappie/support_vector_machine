That game has to be the most addictive fun game ever made. I've got a bunch of homework that I need to do this week which is ok the worst thing right now is that my body is trying to kill me with allergies. Susan's folks left after a visit that she enjoyed, but I think she's pretty happy to have her apartment to herself again. Here is a couple of stories that caught my attention:  urlLink This stuff  is so cool the least dense substance ever found it's carbon nano-foam.   urlLink Here  is a article about 52 people arrested in south Africa due to a law that has been around since the apartheid era, and this law is pretty nasty.  urlLink Here  is a good story about the 9/11 commission and the white house's lack of cooperation. That's all for now I'll try and update some more either later tonight or tomorrow.
