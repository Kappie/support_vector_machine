How can you go wrong with a set that starts off, "You give new meaning to the word delicious.  You're putting me in...OVERDRIVE!!"  Now _this_ is music to code by.  Or is that, "music by which to code?"  Who cares.  
 
 If you've never worked while listening to electronica, you are missing out on something special.  Electronica is the new classical music.  No words (unless we're talking Vocal Trance or something), just beats and melody.  You can get stuff to energize you, numb your mind, freak you out, or relax you.  Its your choice, but you'd be surprised how this music can help you harness in the good energy.  Harness energy, block bad.  Feel the flow.  It's circular...the flow... urlLink all good things .
