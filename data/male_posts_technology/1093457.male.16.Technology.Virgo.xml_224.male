We ahev problems here we need to sort out, we had a bit of a domestic last night. Lots of shouting. My dad no has to work a 12 hour shift instead of he usual 7 hour. Fair enough with the war and all, they need heightened security. I hope this weekend turns out for the best.  Please spare some throughts for the 12 who died in the copter crash and the one american marine who was KIA today and their famillies.
