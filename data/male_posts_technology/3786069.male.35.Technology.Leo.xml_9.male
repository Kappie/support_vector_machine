Surprisingly I slept well on that army cot, probably because I was exhausted from the waiting around and travel. But I still woke up at the crack of dawn in preparation of traveling to Camp Victory which is across from BIAP. Looking back it wasn't that big of a deal but being new to the country and not knowing what to expect was a scary thought.  I tried calling my contacts first thing that morning but I got no answers from any of the phone numbers. Fortunately I hooked up with a couple of army guys that had a bus headed to Victory. They were nice enough to take me to KBR billeting which is where people who are in transit stay. The whole bus ride over all I kept thinking about was the briefing we had at CRC about IEDs (Improved Explosive Devices). I don't remember a time when I rode in a vehicle that I was so concerned with every bump in the road, piece of trash on the side and vehicles we passed. But it’s only a short road that you have to drive before you get to Camp Victory and all the concerns are very short lived once you make it to the base.  Camp Victory is a huge base that is primarily the grounds that use to be Saddam Hussein’s Presidential Palace. It was so strange to drive around and see all these buildings that were not to long ago occupied by Saddam's regime. The base is split into two, a north and a south. Most of the palace is located in Victory South.  I make it to KBR billeting and they assign me to the transit tent. Low and behold that same army cot awaits me for my bed. I think it's following me across the country. The one difference is I found an unused cushion to make it somewhat more comfortable then to prior two cots. My 4 days at Victory were not bad. I spent my time going to MWR for the internet, eating at the DFAC (dining facility), shopping at the PX and calling around to arrange travel to Babylon. My first day I managed to hook up with Keith Young, a former coworker of mine who basically convinced me to come here. He kept telling me there isn't too much to worry about on the bases and as long as you stay on base it’s not as bad as what you see on the news. He got a $500 bonus for referring me to ITT. Sadly I didn't get a chance to go into the palace liked I wanted but it was satisfying just the same to see it in person from the outside.  It pays to do things for yourself. When I was told I would be assigned to Camp Babylon they told me my travel would be from Doha to Baghdad by C130 aircraft and from Camp Victory to Babylon by military convoy. I was not looking forward to this at all. I don't want to be on anybodies convoy in this country. When I mentioned this to a few people someone came back and said why don't you fly down there. At that point I immediately started calling around to find out who flies to Babylon. Well luckily I got in contact with of a National Guard Air Unit that flies Blackhawk Helicopter. They have missions regularly to and from Victory and Babylon. I called daily for space a (space available) and I lucked out and got a flight to Babylon by Blackhawk helo. So this promptly ended my 4 days in Baghdad.
