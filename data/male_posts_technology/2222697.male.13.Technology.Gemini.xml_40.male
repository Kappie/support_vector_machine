And i will probably after school be in tech class molding plasic......This is why i only missed 2 periods last semester. I could have gone to school, But, there is nothing i can change about the past. I did nothing the rest of sunlight. But at 6 i left with my dad and we went to the dallas go club at the barnes and noble. I played twice and lost both times. Doesnt matter because i had fun. I watched naruto 55 before everyone else!!!! Haha! darkanime subbed it so i got it off of torrent i dont think any of my friends have seen it yet though. Great episode! you can get it off kazza or animesuki.com. Sleep-time is now....
