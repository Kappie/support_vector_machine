Managers  supervisors from all over kerala, karnataka, andhra  tamil nadu were present. After all the training program during the day the evenings  night were the most enjoyable.  The first evening saw us celebrate with a model named Malaika and a AJ named Ashok. It was full of "Kuthu" dance if thamizh songs were played. With drinks also available in the hall u should imagine the fun.  Right from the branch manager, regional manager  district manager danced with us.  The second evening had swimming pool games followed by casino with drinks and dance(ellam dapankuthu thaan).  Also met many of my UG friends after a long time.  Had a busy week after the program.  On satirday went for "Ghilli" movie. Vijay babu wanted me to tell about the movie in the blog. So here are my views.  RIGHT from the start to finish it is so fast  enjoyable.  Director Tharani like his previous movies follows a single line story but makes it so much enjoyable with his screenplay.  The story is Vijay protects Trisha from her uncle Prakash Raj who wants to marry her any cost. How he does it is shown with lots of twists  turns.  Songs are for the masses.The whole theatre dances for all the tunes..As usual Trisha is Ravishing(hihihi) and Vijay has acted in style.  The chasing scenes have been taken in style.  It will be a good entertainer for all.  Bye
