Poncho was getting mad at Joe English...er...British for throwing a shovel in a precision landing on his right brake handle. He was off it. You had to be there.  I read a lot of Kelly's LJ archives. I really wish I could have found those a LOT earlier. I read this and remembered.  "I was in the health room and crying (Ben was there...really embarrasing.)"  Kelly...my dear Kelz0rz...kel mah belle...don't ever feel embarrased in front of the personal concierge that I am. DO NOT EVER HESITATE TO CALL YOUR PERSONAL CONCIERGE THAT I HAPPEN TO BE.  Onto everything I want to say.  Kelly, Brittany, Jacque, Rosalie, Kels A., Christine...anyone else I forget. You're all incredibly beautiful. I want you to realize that so I don't have to smash that into your head with a 2x4.  Mrs. Khormann (Our "IT" bitch. She's not IT.) is a stupid whore. She's all right sometimes, but Nick and I know more about Linux then she knows about Windows. That says a lot.  I love my dad. A lot. I can't tell you how awesome it is to live with just my dad. (My parents are divorced and Ali lives in Greeley.)  I don't belive how some guys, some of my friends even can treat their girlfriends. I can't ever picture me doing some of the things they do. I almost want a girlfriend just to show the rest of the male population how to treat a woman.  Do I really care about grades? NO.  Currently caring about:  Kelly: 88% Path-E-Tech: 2% This post: 2% My dog: 2% More toner for my LaserJet 4: 4% Telling every single person I care about just how much I love them, in case I die or something: 4%  I think that's 100%...  I'm still a little mad about not reading Kel's life before. I feel like I shoulda done something...and I'm mad for how she's been treated by guys. I'm mad that I forgot all about my clarinet lesson after school today.  I need to re-network my SOHO.  I love you, Jacque. And Rosalie. And Brittany B. And Kelly. All of you. A lot. Oh, and Laura Willson. IN THE GROUP: WILLSON, JQ, KELZ0RZ, BRITTANY.  Ending the longest fucking post of my life, Your IT guy, -Mister Benjamin William Jones, I  Uh... I think I meant:  -beej
