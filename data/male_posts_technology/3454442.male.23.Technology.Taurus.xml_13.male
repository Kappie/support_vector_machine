To be honest I have gained a sincere appreciation for his leadership and charisma that led America through the 1980s.  As many of you have read and listened to, he changed the political culture of America to a degree we may never witeness again - his down to earth approach that touched the common man may only equal that of FDR during the 1930s.  With that said, I know this will draw sharp criticism from some, but the right wing movement that Reagan brought into power (Wolfowitz, Rumsfield, Cheney, Pearl, etc.) is slowly destroying itself and America with it.  I am not attacking the man himself (one for who I already admitted to having a stronger admiration for)just stating that these individuals came into being under Reagan and our now running the show....into the ground (see gay marriage and unilateral international relations approaches).    In conclusion, Reagan did indeed bring together this country following a turbulent decade of deceit, I fear the movement he brought to power today is leading us to another period of turmoil - one that will impossible to fix.
