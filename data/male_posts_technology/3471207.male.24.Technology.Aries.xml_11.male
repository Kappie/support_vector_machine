I think the thermostat got faulty so all the items inside froze. Basically the overnight food and everything inside either froze or were very cold. Anyway, the new one looks better than the old one, though it's not the BIG fridge that i'd wanted. My dad actually chose it himself. Nevermind, next time when this one breaks down i'll buy a fridge of my own. heheehe.     Besides that, today was quite a stressful day. Had calls coming in from  urlLink ywc  and other church calls..means more work!!! Anyway, i just got back from visitation. Had to go to 5 houses to pass them the DVDs..i didn't expect to take 2.5 hours to travel to all 5 of them even though they were in the west. It was tiring and i was yawning in the car after 3 houses.  We just put those DVDs in the letter box for 3 of them. For 2, at least we could deliver it personally to them. There's supposed to be a 6th one, but when we got there, the letterbox was locked. And we called this guy up, he said he can't remember requesting for the DVDs...grrrr..wasted trip down there. I think we got to call him again to try to jolt his memory.    Tomorrow will be a busy day for me..a whole line of activities awaits especially in the afternoon..until then...
