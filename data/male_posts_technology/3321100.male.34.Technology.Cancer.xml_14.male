First you can't do a BBQ alone, you must be at least two, and if you have many friends, it's better ( for BBQ ). You must have all the good ingredient (meat, salad  vegetable, wine, sauce). And you must really want to do a BBQ (really important). When I know that I'll made a BBQ on evening, I think to this all the day. I prepare the sauce for the meal the morning, I put the wine on fridge, and I cook tsatziki sauce 3 hours before BBQ. When time has come, WE made BBQ, I light on the fire and she cook the salad (man on fire, woman on salad, a real clich√©) And when all is alright, we put the table on the garden, and we eat this marvelous meal while mosquitoes suck our blood  Grr . For those who know I'm French you can now said French BBQ was the most romantic. :D The greater pleasure for us, is that we had wait this moment for long time. Some stupid guy who lived in great town in France do BBQ all the day on an electric system with a cheap meat  cheap beer. Let them this stupid guy alone. BBQ was not like Mc Donald ! As all the pleasure we could found on our life, more rare it is, better it is. Do this only with the real desire to do it.  For those who have finish to read this post, you could read again it and replace all the "BBQ" word by something like "Making love" and you will have my real thought. But it works with BBQ too ;)
