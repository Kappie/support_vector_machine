In 6th grade I had a real bad stomach ache I finally learned to sleep and it went away, but man do those hurt.  My skin is starting to break out, no worries, at least I am not a prep and completely judged by my face. I really need a haircut, it is hard to have long curly hair it always goes POOF. I would like straight hair, It is much easier to tame and it doesn't go POOF!  Floating around  urlLink gamespy  last night with our dial up POWER! at my house I found out about the  urlLink Metal Gear Solid   urlLink comic book  and I read the first few of  urlLink IT CAME FROM JAPAN! .  Amazing what you can lear by spending 5 minutes on  urlLink Gamespy.com .  Off to attempt to play America's Army.
