But I've been playing video games. Distractions from the real. From the people we know and love.  Music that is on: Guster - Either way  Sleep? who needs it? I have another post to write after this one. Will I be asleep before 4 tonight? Does it even matter?  Parts of my life are coming to an end, others are beginning to blossom. Relationships change, evolve.  I AM the hurricane that is my life.   Peace-
