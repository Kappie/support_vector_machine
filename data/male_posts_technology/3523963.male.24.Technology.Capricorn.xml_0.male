This was something which we expected but certainly not to this extent.What else a software guy would do, if he doesn't have proper work to do..Yes ..Browse, download..we used to download music files very often earlier. In the same way i downloaded yesterday some MP3 files. Today morning, i got a mail from the administrator asking me not to download music files. Oops..I have been monitored all throughout the day on my internet activity. Definitely i didn't expect this. Hope they don't say "Stop blogging" in few days. How can i call my behaviour here..reckless indeed..
