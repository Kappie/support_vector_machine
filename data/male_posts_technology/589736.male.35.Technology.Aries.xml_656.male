A shame the story is veering from Tolkien now not only in terms of tone, but now of plot.  Note that the former issue (different tone) was my only complaint re: FotR.  Though I suspected slippage might kick in somewhere in the second movie.  I still maintain that Tolkien wrote a mythology, a history, and a travelogue, with heroic elements -- *not* an adventure story.  Which is what Jackson appears to have decided to film.  Which begs the question:  is this a book, or a film?  Clearly a film -- and as such, while it is a similar animal, it is truly another species than a book, with its own rules and expectations.  To put people in the seats, you don't film a book -- you pull the film out of the book, even if you have to alter it  to do so.  One can film a book, and do it beautifully -- but you better resign yourself to the art circuit.  We'll be glad to see you, but we ain't gonna give you box office.
