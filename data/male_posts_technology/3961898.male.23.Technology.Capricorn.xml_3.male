Going to have 2 eggs (1.2 carbs) 2 peices of sausage (1 carb) and 3 pieces of bacon (0 carbs) So that is a total of 2.2 carbs for breakfast again this morning. Sure beats the Hardees 3-5 carbs for their breakfast bowl (although it is good, and I'll probably have to get it some morning when I'm in a hurry) This means I have 17.8 carbs left for today....    Today will be interesting. Second day on the diet and I've got to go to work. Work is one of the main reasons I can't diet. I have to be out and about in the Double Kwiks so much and that makes it hard to diet, but hopefully with this one, that won't be the case as fat is not a factor. I can get just chili anywhere, or just a piece of hamburger meat somewhere... So hopefully it will be easier to diet on Atkins while at work. I think I'm going to take some pork rinds, and Chili with me to work. Interesting combination...      1:15 PM  For Lunch I had some Chili for 1 carb and pork rinds for .5 cards and ham for 0 carbs and jello for 0 carbs. So for lunch, I ate a total of 1.5 carbs.Total so far I've eatten 3.7 carbs today, and that leaves me 16.3 carbs left for today.      5:30 PM   ForDinner I had too much. I ate a Hamburger with Cheese and A1 Sauce for atotal of 3 carbs. I also had salad and dressing for 1.75 carbs, and some cabbage and meat for 3 cards. I also had some Ice Cream for dessert for 0 carbs. This was a total of 7.75 and so far I have 8.55 left.      10:00 PM   Later I got hungry and ate another hamburger and cheese for2 carbs. This means I have 6.55 left for the day.    Total for the DayI ate 13.45 carbs. Not to bad for 13.45 out of 20...
