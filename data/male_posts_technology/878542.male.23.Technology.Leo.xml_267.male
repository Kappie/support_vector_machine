Space is a place we should have been trying much harder to get to. I've wanted to be there since I was very young. It's where we'll really grow up, once we can leave the gentle nursery of our Earth.    urlLink Burt Rutan  has been at the forefront of airframe experimentation for a while now, and with the backing of Paul Allen, I think he'll do it again.
