I said Karissa where did you hear that and she says well   FS   (Jon is what she really said) says it all the time!  Well after that conversation Karissa and I were able to run a couple of errands and then come home and she played in the pool and I worked in the back yard some more.  I ran the weedeater, mowed, and cleaned out one of the flower beds and cleaned out the bird bath.  I finished about the time that the thunder and lightning started and it POURED rain.    There were a couple of times that the thunder and lightning scared her but for the most part all was ok with her.  Tomorrow morning we get to go check out the circus so that will be a great time I think.
