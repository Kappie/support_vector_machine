I took my daughter to the same dentist I had when I was a kid.  urlLink Dr. Kearns  is a great childrens and adolescent dentist. As I watched my daughter go through the whole cleaning, examine and florid process I was reminded of my own time in that little purple chair holding the little water game.  This was my daughters first visit and it was considerably better than my first visit. She had no cavities or problems. This is very different from my experiences as a child. I have weak teeth and I think my first visit yielded a cavity or two.  urlLink Dr. Kearns  was always gentle but firm and I think if I had had any other dentist, I would have quit going permanently. My daughter had the best first dental cleaning ever. No cavities, she received a goody bad (toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, stickers and a pencil) and had strawberry fluoride.  I would recommend  urlLink Dr. Kearns and Ashby  to anyone with children and hopefully the words of my daughter to the dentist "I'm never going to have ANY cavities!" will ring true.
