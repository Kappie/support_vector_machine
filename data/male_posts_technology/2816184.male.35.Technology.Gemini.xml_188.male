You've already been through enough trauma. Go get your dog.... go home and phone as many people as you can think of in the area that might have an idea of where Tom could have gone if he got away from  these people.   Since that *thing* is attracted to me.... I would rather you stay out of danger and not come with me and Jean (nod to Jean). If there's going to be trouble because of it - I'd rather you be safe.   We're going to wander by the dumpsters.... and track down Hax which could take awhile.  Call me on my cell (give number again) if you need me.
