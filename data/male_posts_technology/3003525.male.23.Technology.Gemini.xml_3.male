Boourns on that.  You know,  urlLink Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind  wasn't as good as I remember it being. It used to be 90% comedy skits, and 10% serious. But, now it's half serious skits, half comedy, and the comedy isn't as good :-/. I'm sorry to say it, but the current cast isn't as good as it was the first couple times I saw it. Holy shit, the taxi ride home was brutal. The dude did 80 mph the entire way home, and managed to scare the shit out of us.   today, I woke up, showered, watched  urlLink Sleepless in Seattle , ate cocoa pebbles, fell asleep, woke up, ate a burrito, tried to go bowling, didn't bowl, bought a garbage can, ate Thai food, came home, and played  urlLink The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay  for my  urlLink Xbox . Holy crap, Riddick is a good game.  Well, I've got a full 5 day work-week ahead of me. Apparently, we get July 5th off. Good times there, I guess. My buddy, Dan, is going to be coming back from Iraq this upcoming weekend. It'll be really fucking great to see him. it's been almost 6 months since he's been out, so, it's been awhile. His girlfriend, Molly, is super fucking excited about his return. He'll only be here for a couple weeks, but, I'm sure that they'll make the most of it.   ah well. I'm gunna read for awhile, and try to get some zzzzzz's.
