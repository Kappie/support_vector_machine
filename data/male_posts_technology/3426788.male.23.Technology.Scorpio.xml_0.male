I’ve uploaded it 2 days ago  marketed it. SMS, Mail, Instant Messages, Chat Room advertising everything I’ve done to tell the world that I was online. It was a good experience. My mood was pregnant. It is like buying a home in downtown New York or Sunset Boulevard. lol even Upstate New York is not a bad idea.    I was dying to see my guest book  No. of visitors. The first one to sign in was my dear bro. Heramb .. Well he is a nice guy. Always funny … yet somber at times but even that solemnity has a tinge of laughter in it. Whenever I watch Will Smith , I find Heramb so much reminiscent of him .. lol like I did , yesterday, when I was watching MIB II on HBO. He was online that night and provided me with good hints n tips regarding my website. Well he was kinda busy wid damsels …. I know it’s high time for him to get some one … (hope His parents r not reading this:P)   The one comment I was keenly waiting for was of Ashutosh. Now He is my dear bro. too but exactly opposite of me. A Very Shy Guy , as he loves to call himself , skinny , always wearing the naïve specs of intelligence. As expected he sent me a long mail very next day with heapz of tips n tricks. It was a good mail to read. He diagnosed the website’s present condition well  presented new ideas. I replied him immediately expressing my joy for an apt reply  thanking him for his program (which hotmail deleted cuz an .exe file as an attachment is considered as a potential threat.)   Before him, I met a good friend of mine. Anu, as I call her wid love, I met her few months down the line in chat rooms n sent her summer of 69 song in Mail :P … Since then I never chatted wid her in Private Messages. As the juggernaut of time rolled, we met again tht night. I’ven’t seen her in person, but I can sense her Suave nature  Sprightly presence around. I guess u don’t have to meet people to know them, Its something inside that ticks. Or else peepz live together for number of yrs n feel astonished every now n then bout their partners. The best thing : SHE LOVES GAMING LIKE ME. I Dunno, How good she is in CS (Counter Strike) as she proclaims. Let me have a game wid her someday... n let me see who get the most FRAGS.   Back to the 31’st may …. I was thinking the whole day bout nature of my website. I had a very crude, rookie design online. My main intention was to put up a website for game programmers, loaded wid tuts n games. Some sections for vb/vc programmers and discussion forums should be handy.   To be frank, I was happy when I designed my flash based website. Later I found it very spiteful. A failed attempt of a Greenhorn as u call or a Neophyte (Thanks to Barron’s :P). Suddenly I found myself visualizing bout the website more and more.   I needed a sleek, super sleek design wid minimum of mess n loadz n loadz of useful links  tutorials.  I will definitely have some flash part in it. Huh tha’s the best way to show ur knowledge bout the damn thing. As a hard ass perfectionist I’m, I believe certain things in life represent U. 1> Your resume 2> Your matrimonial Ad and 3> Your website. If you have spelling mistakes, disorganized content, perplexed design then it shows negligence on ur part  not the finesse you want to depict.
