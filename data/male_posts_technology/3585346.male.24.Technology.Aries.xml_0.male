But I guess it is a must to maintain it so that I can monitor how it is going.  I just configured my router up and running. And I just revived a old compaq notebook and install wireless on it. My router is wireless! WOOHOO it works like magic now but I do have problem earlier :)  Everything went well I got a well deserved sleep plus I dun have to wear Shirt anymore tomorrow so I will not be ironing any more shirt!!!! CHEERS!!!!!! But I have limited polo-ts I guess it is time for some serious shopping! I need another 3 more decent polo t for my SIZE. Yes I emphasize on it cos it is pretty tough to get my size.  Name card, Company stamp....cannot forget!!
