I like the structured nature of his arguments, be it while describing the subtle ways in which the US will find its position, as the pre-eminent power in the world, threatened or when he illustrates how India should recognize its strengths and the impresive lineage it boasts and mould itself into a power centre, albeit in a local sense at first.  But he starts rambling a little towards the end where he includes a postscript thats relatively irrelevant to the article. :-P   Postscript:  Now for an irrelevant postscript of my own! I wonder why a person who writes for Rediff.com would give a Gmail id for receiving feedback rather than a Rediffmail one?! ;-)
