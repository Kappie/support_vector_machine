We were coming down the hill, and a white Audio pulls out to head east as well.  Unfortunetly this person decided they DIDN'T want to pull into the in-side lane  (they hopefully still teach in drivers ED that when you make a turn you pull into the lane closest to you) and pull into our lane.  I was going 65mph, and slowed down some, but this guy, just goes in front of us. I started laying on the horn and had to jerk the car onto the shoulder to avoid rear-ending them.  THEN...I'm trying to get back onto the road and the guy is STILL there and practically on my bumper. I had to speed up to get back onto the road.  All the while, I was still honking the horn.  PLUS, he had his high-beams on.    After I got back onto the pavement, and got back upto 65mph, the Audi was hanging back about a quarter mile.  I waited for him to speed up, as I figured this @#)$(*@ was the kind of person who loves to speed, and then I got his liscense plate # and called 911.  They pulled onto the HWY from a supper club area, and I figured they had to be drinking.  I was on the phone with 911 as I tried to help  keep an eye on the Audi, so they could get this person.  Unfortunetly they didnt.  They asked that if they did find him, if I would pull up behind the Sherrif and wait for him to approach me to discuss what happened.  My main concern was that after I got the ok from the Sherrif to get out, that I'd run up and beat this person, as they almost caused a major auto accident and endangered the lives of my wife and my children.   I hope that the bad karma this person has building-up catches up to him..
