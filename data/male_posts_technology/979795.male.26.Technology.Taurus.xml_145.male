Even if somebody comes to try to cut my throat right now, in my opinion, they're not necessary my enemy, because I have what we call mushin. When somebody attacks me I don't think about, I'm going to get him, I'm going to do this. It's just a state of mind, a heart without emotion, a mind without emotion that I have, and the only thing I'd do is react to terminating the situation to the best of my ability."   -- Steven Seagal, 7th dan, Shihan, Shinto priest
