That's me! It explains my moments of hyperactivity, and then "crashing". Or being up for days just cos I can. So Now I get to take Risperdal. So Let's see what happens! I am almost scared of being normal!  Well different topic! I was on this dating site  urlLink http://www.myematch.com , and I got a message from this woman in Russia... She also sent some pictures of her.. She is VERY CUTE! So we have been e-mailing back and forth. So that's cool... Man I wish I still fone PHreaked so I can call her!  Well I am tired, and I get to take my first Risperdal!  Lates!
