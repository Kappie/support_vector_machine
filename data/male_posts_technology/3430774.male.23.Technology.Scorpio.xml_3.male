Well, i have learned a lot from this meeting, eg. how to deal with client, how to derive self-knowledge to client convincingly, how to understand client requirement well, and themost importantly, how to negotiate the project budget/cost with client. All these especially the last one is very sensitive, case like you are not capable enough to provide client a good picture of your solution, you might lose that customer. Yes, knowledge and presentation skill is a  NEED  basically to get you into a success career!       Roy told me whereI need to get prepared to handle this kind of cases. Yup, usually proposing a marketing plan or business plan is done by another department but somehow, our client may need people to provide them a technical point of view. This is the cases where i come in, however this is a good opportunity for me to gain different experience instead of just facing the computer all day long. Usually people will scare to face it but for me, i just worried my english skill, i dont have excellent english control skill or maybe should say not up to the required level. How? how? how?      Received SMS from THL, she is now in Singapore since Monday. ahehe, kinda funny also. Our previous conversation were saying if she does not come back bytoday (Thursday), which mean she will stay there for quite some time and ask me to delete all the information related to her, eg. Photos, Hp Number and etc. In today's sms, she remind me again. This is really a weirdest friend i have, in another good representation,  SHE IS SO SPECIAL .haha.. :D Maybe she might dont know i already knew when she is coming back tomorrow, and plan to keep this from me. haha :D So i "cheung kai jiao kai", blaugh her i have removed all the things about her :P >:)Hehe, wonder when she knows about it what is the response ler? keke...      Last thing to mention, this blog site has changed a lot! It has provided a lot of useful features and tools where able to publish the blog in better design. Good Improvement! Keep it ON~         Good Night to all the bloggers!
