I have to go in tomorrow morning for training.  They say they need a second reference which I reported to at a job that I worked.  The one manager wont get back to them.  I tried calling today, but I couldn't get ahold of him.  I can't get ahold of any other managers that I've had.  I don't know what I'm going to do about this.  Now I have to read a long pamphlet on their policies and procedures and do a take home quiz.  So, I've been working on this.  I'll try not to stay away for too long.  See ya later.
