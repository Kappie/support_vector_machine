This prognostication would be welcome to be proved wrong, but is based on the following Anchorage Daily News  urlLink article  on G-Murkowski's ideas for opening ANWR.  If he can open it for Bush, perhaps he can be a shoe-in for the GOP nomination.  It would certainly put Alaska's erstwhile (though can you be totally erstwhile when your daughter has your previous job?) Representative's name out in front of the  urlLink Outside  public.  Which is why he is starting now by suggesting that the  urlLink Permanent Fund  be used to pressure companies that the fund invests in to lobby Congress on behalf of the good people of AK (well, 50.1% of them anyway).
