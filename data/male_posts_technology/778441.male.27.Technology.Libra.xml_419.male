The first salvo has been fired in Delhi where the NCERT curriculum will be replaced by SCERT.   Delhi Government today announced to replace the curriculum of NCERT with that of State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT) in the government-run schools of the Capital.   Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit met HRD Minister Arjun Singh today to apprise him of the changed curriculum. The move appears to be a lead in 'de-saffronisation' of education.   I do not want to discuss the issues behind the saffronisation and the subsequent de-saffronisation of education in the country, but this move by the Delhi and Central Government only goes to prove the age-old adage that history is written by the victors!  So claims like the one below mean nothing to me...   "Over the years, distortion of facts had occurred in text books and education was being tilted towards a particular ideology affecting the secular ethos of the country," Dikshit told reporters citing the cause behind the move to shift.   On the books being introduced, the Chief Minister said these were "strong on facts of history, reinforcing secular ethos of the country" and "nothing had been done to distort history."   After all... all they are doing is to tailor the history books in accordance to their ideology, which, with due respect to Gandhi and Nehru, is nothing but Gandhisation of history, whether you like it or not!
