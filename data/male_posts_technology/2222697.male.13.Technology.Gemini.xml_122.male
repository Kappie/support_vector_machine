I have everything I want, things to waste my time, friends, and most importantly. God. God has given us everything and is completely fair he even died for all the stupid things we have done, and no one has given me anything more than that. I have recently pondered eternity, and if you belive, you will be given it. God cannot be proven by logic, but only by faith. If you only depend on logic to prove your point, you are truly ignorant.  It is good to be around people who agree with you, at camp everyone was republican/christian and it felt good for Steven not to yell at you when you have a point. Sleevo, if you actually read this I have to tell you, Repetition does not make false things true.  If I could leave my old life in colleyville, I would, but somehow I just can't. I am happy here, not stressed all the time by uptight city people and their PTA meetings.  I like it here, and I wouldn't go back if I was offered. It just isn't worth being stressed over.
