This might have been annoying, except that now every time she  sees a fish, like when we're reading "The Cat in the Hat", she says "Bush" - I  can't bring myself to explain the difference, and I'm not sure I could. On  the other hand, we received a nice card from John Kerry for donating to his  campaign, complete with a postcard sized picture of him on the front - my wife  tells me that Eryn found it on the steps yesterday and hauled it all over the  house chanting "Daddy". Either my wife is in trouble (and incredibly  sneaky), Eryn has decided my politics are politics she shares, or Eryn has  greatly misconstrued the amount of hair I have - then again, she never gets to  look at it from the top unless it's time for a piggy back  ride.
