What did I gain from being a part of this institution?  -A few new acquaintances -The chore of keeping the fake pets fed and watered -I now know my bathroom is cleaner than all of ya'lls -I have been shown terrible pictures of people/objects that I never knew existed -And I get to say "Shut up Paul" way more times than I would have if I had never been invited into the house... which makes it all worthwhile.  Thank you :-) You guys are great :-)
