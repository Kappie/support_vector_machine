So the workout was after work and without Amy's coaching. On top of this, I locked Jean out of the house so she had to come up to work to switch cars in order to take John home. Needless to say she wasn't happy.   Workout: Stationary bike for 5 minutes Stretch Bench press	3x12 Chest press and fly machine	3x12 Pushups	3x12 DB shoulder press	3x12 Side raise	3x12 Crunches 3x15  Leg raise 3x15.   Stationary bike for 10 minutes  Post Workout: My arms died midway into my first set of Side raise. Just would not move. Plus I could feel myself cheating so I opted out. I was also pressed to get home to help Jean with John so I did just 10 minutes on the bike but at level 3 rather than 2.  I learned today that until I'm feeling more comfortable, I need to work with Amy since it is much easier to work out with a trainer keeping you honest.
