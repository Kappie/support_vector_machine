Military men and women are being villified for their treatment of POWs in Abu Ghraib.  I find this unnerving.  Answer this question for me: What good is it to take a POW?  Seriously, what does anyone have to gain from it?  The geneva convention says that a POW only has to give name, rank and serial number.  Not much useful information there.  So what's the point?  People entrusted with the care of POWs are supposed to keep them clothed, fed, and otherwise in a state that they were in before capture (healthy and such).  So now, after taking prisoners, the military now has to utilize resources to keep the POWs happy and content for the duration of their stay.  So what's the point?  If the military cannot take prisoners and try to ascertain vital information that could ultimately save lives by brining an earlier end to a conflict, then why take prisoners?  Why not just shoot them where they stand?    If the military takes a prisoner, they have to treat them with respect and dignity, even though 15 minutes before, they were trying to KILL EACH OTHER.  Can't ask questions of the POW like, where are other troops located.  Or, where is your HQ.  Any self-respecting soldier is NOT going to answer that question.  And now, methods like sleep deprivation, and exchanging food for information are not allowed.  Yes, those methods are awful, but necessary for ultimate victory in any conflict.  If POWs cannot be used to garner information, then what's the point?  The point is, apparently, it's better off for the military to kill the enemy than it is to keep them alive.  Alive they are of no use (can't garner any useful information).  Dead they are no use.    At least dead they don't cost resources and more importantly MY TAX MONEY to keep them clothed, fed, and healthy.
