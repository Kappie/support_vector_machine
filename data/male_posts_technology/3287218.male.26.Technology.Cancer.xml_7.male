I work for the Pennsylvania Radio Project Office in Harrisburg, PA.  I monitor tower sites for problems (power, no connectivity, etc) and fix them or get the process in motion to get them fixed.  It is a good job and hope it becomes full time.  2.  I just returned from Vacation.  I went out to Kansas (you know where Dorothy and Toto live).  My mom is from there and her family had a reunion.  So I took off work and went with them.  We (my dad, mom, brother and his gf) drove out to Kansas.  It is a 2-day drive but sometimes y0u can do it in one 24 hr period.  We get out to Kansas and have the reunion and spend alot of time with family.  We also spend nights in different people's homes.  This prooves to be interesting since each time I sleep in a different bed, I dont sleep very well.  But I managed.  So we visited alot with family and ate alot of food (diet time).  We left on Thursday morning at 10 am (mom makes us get off late).  We then stop for our lunch and supper somewhere in Columbia, Missouri.  At that point we make the decision to drive thru the night and arrive home between 7 and 8 am on Friday.  My brother drove from 3 pm to like 1 or 2 in the morning.  He took us from Missouri to Ohio and then my parents drove from Ohio to Pennsylvania.  (I was took tired to drive, I slept in the backseat of the van).  So this has been my life for the past few weeks.  Tomorrow I can go to church.  It will be my first time back to church since I started my new job.  So I am excited.
