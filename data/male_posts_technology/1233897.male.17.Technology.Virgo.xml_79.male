We just moved it over to Tuesday night this week, and the entire Stages (the company that's doing  The Cross and the Switchblade ) crew and cast were in the building doing a final dress rehersal before tomorrow night.  Needless to say, things were hecktic at best.  Gwen didn't seem to mind though (I invited her to the opening play yesterday, and Youthgroup this morning).  Her mom's prolly coming to the play too.  I pushed my annual insanely large slumber party back to the 24th and 25th because a large portion of the people I would be inviting to it were doing stuff this week (including the airsoft war this Saturday, which I'm prolly going to ride with Oliva and Jeremy to).  O, i FINALLY got broadband!!!  (more specifically cable modem)  *is happy*
