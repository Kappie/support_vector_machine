Gene Ray, a (to quote  urlLink Waxy.org ) "highly entertaining nutcase", says that there are four different simultaneous days within a single rotation of earth, and if you laugh at this, "you're stupid and evil and deserve to be spit on publicly." Before reading on, let me caution you by saying that anything within your reach while reading this article, is not safe: uncontrollable urges to destroy your monitor may follow.... That having been said, let me introduce his profound (¿) ideology by quoting the first sentence on his site:     Creation of 4 simultaneous 24 hour days, within a single rotation of Earth, empowers me above all 1-day gods and educated stupid scientists. I will wager $10,000.00 on it.   He continues with another onslaught of wordy blather that, when sifted through, leaves him calling himself schizophrenic (which he misspells) and youthful, claiming to be above the "Wise Men" because of his establishing a "Chair of Wisdom", and goes on to curse Tom Green of all people, claiming him to be evil...  And that's just the next three sentences...  From  urlLink here  you can download his  urlLink interview  on TechTV, and if you really insist on torturing yourself, his homepage is  urlLink here   O, and I think he's watched a bit too much Peter Pan:  "Unless the children organize into a powerful force to stop the adult ramsacking of Nature, they must now prepare for the coming adult inflicted hell on Earth.
