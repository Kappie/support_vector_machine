Actually Michael is a good guy to live with, Taiwan's living condition is not as good as other places, but he has no complain at all.  He won't bother my sleep hour.  He is quiet.  All in all, it's not much trouble living with him.  But still, I have 2 problems with his staying (But nothing personall, both are my own problem):  1. It's common sense that a guest coming all the way from the other end of earth, I'll have to take him out and stuff...  But everyday I still have to work --> and that is very tiresome...  Of course, I can choose to sleep early everyday and don't treat him at all, but... I choose to tire myself... it's no one's fault but mine.  2. That's another personal stuff... and it's a long story. Basically, my renter downstairs pays for my electricity - and she complains ALL THE TIME about how much electricity I spend in summer.  She was super annoying and always trying to deduct the electricity from her renting fee.  Anyways, so this summer, (because I don't like her at all), I tried super hard to use as little electricity as possible.  No Air Condidtion at any time if I'm alone in the house.  I would use Fans only. Until Michael came................ Of course, it's not polite to my guest if I don't turn on the air con --> For it is damn too hot in taiwan.  I'm not 小氣, because I don't pay the electricty, gotta nothing to do with me.  It's just that... the renter is doomed to file complain this month... and it's not a pleasant thought... >  Anyhow, Tony  Michael, if you are reading this ...   Tony, next time tell me earlier about the plans. Dai Aho~~~~  Michael, we had a lotta fun together, and I think it's a very great idea to travel around in Asia before you start working.  Although my place can't offer you the best accommodation, I do sincerely hope that you had lots of fun and enjoy the stay in Taiwan.  I'll see you back in Vancouver soon~  Jeffrey... out...
