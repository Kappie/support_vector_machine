So does anyone read this blog anymore?  I know Tim still writes in it, so probably eh?  Obey my dog! Obay?  No that looks weird.  I think the first one was right but it just doesn't look like it.  Maybe it's because of the capital O.  obey   No that's pretty much just a weird looking word.  HAPPY, happy, HAPPY  Heh he he heh heh heh....
