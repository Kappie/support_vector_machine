The reason for changing feed-reader was simple; RSS Reader did not download and display the posts correctly anymore. For some reason it showed old posts as new and downloaded them over again and all sorts of fubar behaviour... It was getting very, very annoying... And RSS Bandit looks like a nice replacement, it's coded in .Net as well btw. Interesting! :) Has that Office2003 look...   w.bloggar is cool! Really, it is! Windows program to post blog entries, as simple as that! And it co-operates nicely with RSS Bandit, so I can by pressing just  few buttons and turning a handle blog about another entry... (links them with link and text) Nice! And I also installed a plugin for Winamp, so I can display my current song and stuff on my blog... :)  Like this:  [Listening to: On Rich and Poor - Amorphis - Elegy (5:19)]
