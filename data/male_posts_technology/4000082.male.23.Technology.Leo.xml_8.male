What I am now trying to do is take scenarios and explain the roles each individual plays in a meeting.   So here goes the different roles represented in a graphical manner:       Let us analyze the chart since if we go deep lot of truths reveal:  Before that I want to emphasize the fact contribution is further divided into useful and  useless contribution.   ROLE1 ANALYSIS:    Role 1 should be the best, as this person has more knowledge and more contribution.   Scenario 1: This person has more knowledge and more useful contribution.  Scenario 2: This person has more knowledge and more useless contribution.   But can a guy with more knowledge contribute in a useless way. So this is a contradiction  and you would be thinking that useless contribution means less knowledge. No that is not the case.   Here’s an example. This guy has more knowledge in particular domain which the meeting is about.  But since he has more knowledge he overdo’s the contribution by asking Hi-Fi Technical questions and in that  Way the other team members cannot sync up with his way of thinking. So in a way he contributes more  to the meeting but not contributing the way others understand.   So watch out. Scenario 1 of ROLE1 supercedes Scenario 2
