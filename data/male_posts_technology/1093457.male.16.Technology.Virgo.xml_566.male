I am slightly disappointed that Jenny hasn't rung to say goodbye like we always do before one of us go on holiday. Surely she can't be that busy to take a few minutes out??  I'll have my mobile with me everyone so if your bored text moi, I should have a signal and hopefully there will be somewhere to charge it. I'll let ya'll know how Alton Towers works out, air.... Hehe.  Have a nice week ya'll! Byeeeeeeeeeee!
