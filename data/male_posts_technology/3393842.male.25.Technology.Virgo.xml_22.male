Lets involve all possible components, verbal, visual, assumed common sense, everything !!   Do you think the bandwidth would be more when there's an arguement ? Or would that be a situation as in a "high traffic on a low bandwidth" situation.  To make the measurement easier let me define the endpoint. It is from one mind capable of cognition to another. 'Cos there could be a lot of data loss in the carrier, medium losses (misinterpreted words), external noise, the receiver having no free buffer space (pre-occupied mind),... So the item to be measured is the effective bandwidth after all these losses.  How do you think we can measure it ?  Though human communication involves communicating feelings, moods (if they are different), etc.. lets restrict ourselves to 'an idea' or a learning. The measurements should read something like 'N' Quantums of ideas per hour between a mother and her kid.  And how would it be with a guy and girl in love ? I wonder if anything would get transferred at all (I meant 'an idea' or 'a learning') :-)  And how would it be in a business deal ?
