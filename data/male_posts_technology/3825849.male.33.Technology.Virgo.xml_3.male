I have looked, briefly, at some of the people on blogspot who share my taste in books and movies and I have been very disappointed. On my list are things like “Foucault's Pendulum” and “The Ninth Gate.” What is difficult for me are the number of people who like such stories not because they are well told and captivating for the mind, but because they actually believe that the stories are real!   This gets into muddy waters, of course, because—as the Greeks noticed—all words are lies; illusions crafted by the sounds of our voices and the shapes of our letters. As my most feared college professor, “Dr. Doom,” often said: “all history is rhetoric.” But does that give us carte blanche to hack up old churches searching for the Holy Grail? It becomes a question of reasonableness and consistency.   We can believe that magical lines of energy intersect hither and yon, waiting for us to tap into them, but what evidence to we have? What kind of energy? How do we measure it? Energy is an event—vibrations at a molecular level. We can measure those vibrations. Do we find any lines of vibrations crisscrossing the planet?  Well and good for science, but what about history? Perhaps there was a grail and perhaps someone did hide it and leave clues to its location in the architecture of a church in Scotland. What is our evidence? A work of fiction—not the historical kind of, say, Suetonious, but the modern kind which says right on its inside cover: “fiction.” Not the strongest place to begin, but so we must.   I can’t speak to the specifics of “The DaVinci Code” I haven’t time to spend (waste?) reading it. I can, however, return to the master of all such works: “Foucault’s Pendulum;” my favorite book of the last 100 years. People who like it seem to forget one key point: the story is made up! Not just that Umberto Eco wrote it as fiction, but that the characters in it make up the story within the story. As they say to each other: “everything must be connected” even if they have to make it up. Everything must mean everything. Patterns in the chaos. Meaning from the madness.   Indeed, that is the whole point of “Foucault’s Pendulum:” we make our own realities and those realities are very seductive and powerful. The surprise of the four friends when they find out that dozens of “secret societies” are all busy running around looking for a purpose. These groups find a purpose in the fiction of these four editors and then proceed to kill over it.   Nothing has power to influence and lead people like these quests for magical powers, the grail, the philosopher’s stone, the elixir of life. Everything falls under the categories they represent: endless life, endless wealth, endless power. Dot.com bubbles, cures for cancer, wars. Our emergence from the Dark Ages began with Christian monks looking for more and finding it in Jewish Cabbala. The great figures of science during and after the Renaissance are less well known for their failed quests for immortality—gravity, calculus, astrological navigation, were all an afterthought.   So go look for the holy grail, but make sure you donate to the church’s remodeling fund while you are there. Don’t see the actual beauty of the architecture and art—just subsidize it for those few of us who actually see what is there instead of what we want to be there.
