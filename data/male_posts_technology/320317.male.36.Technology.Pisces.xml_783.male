There are fewer variables to contend with and less testing and debugging required. Such a controlled environment produces excellent code quickly at lower overall cost."

 Whenever you compare PC to Macs the above fact has to be taken into consideration. Apple doesn't design for the broadest reach in hardware, thus they have a distinct advantage when creating an operating system. However, they pay for it with market share as you are the only one producing the machine."
