Now his parents have filed a lawsuit against the last driver that Pappadake passed. They said the driver veered to the left, causing their son to leave the road and crash. The lawsuit, said the White Plains Journal News, made no reference to police conclusions.    All I can say is Yeah GO ON. What ever happened to personal responsibility?
