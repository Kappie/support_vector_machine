It's a flip fone, I'm not a big fan of flip phones... it retails for $699, they're pushing it bigtime on tv at the moment. It's alltogether overly non-spectacular. Why the hell have I got it then? Because the price was right..  This phone cost me precisely -dick- , as in, nothing, and it affords me 500 texts for $10 - which is still a bloody good deal, and 100 free offpeak minutes, so I can call people, and recite blog entries , without it costing me a dime. Sweet. My nokia 5100 still pwns, as the virtually indestructable little bundle of neatness that it is, it has a torch, a radio, a thermometer, calorie counter and db meter. Weird? yes. Cool? yes. I have 200 gigs of storage space now, and am already sick of the piddling speed at which 900mhz and 128mb of ram propells a person, or rather, DOESNT propell a person. Photoshop owns my ram, and I think will eventually thrash my hard drive into an early grave, so I'm off tomorrow to price up some new kit. That is todays entry, ka kite ano.
