W/end 2 managed to walk straight into George Micheals 41st Birthday and stay until 0730hrs the next day. Included a number of silly stories I won't go into right now. You'll have to ask!  W/end 3, went to a very good friends new flat Nr Clapham common for a meal and wine, ended up partying at local cafe. This then turned into a next day outdoor venue called lovebox, absolutely awesome, saw groove armada, Mr Scruff, and some pixies when we overdid it...  W/end 4, back to the 7 days a week thing, holding out until our next major blowout in august/sept... HELP!
