Kenley will probally call you as well paul, they said to me that if i want they would arrange me another instructor from kenley, but they also said they dont know what she is doing now. I have talked with tom about this and he aggrees that she is either gonna start up on her own or join another company, and kenley aggree that it would be good for us to stay with her. so i will be contacting her to find out what she is doing, and hopefully will be continuing my lessons with her. Talk to you all soon, Dave
