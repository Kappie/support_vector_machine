This must be what all the other losers were doing when I was in there causing riots.  Life was a lot funnier when I was being a stupid drunk retard with yast.  I say yes to 3am power hours.  I want my miller lite surgically reattached to my hand.  Holla back if you wanna be a little crizzzy tonight.  And awaaaay we go!  Smash
