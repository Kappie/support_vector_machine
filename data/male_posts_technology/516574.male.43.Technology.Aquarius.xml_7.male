It's been about 18 months now (if memory serves me correctly), and while we did lose 2, the remaining 4 cats have all been doing pretty good, all things considered: Climate is okay for a 15-year-old, Smokie for an overweight 5-year-old with asthma and a heart murmur, Cutesie for a mildly 'autistic' 2-year-old... and then there's Angel, a 5-year-old who was certainly the runt of his litter to start with, and is currently the only one of the 4 who shows any obvious signs of FIP whatever (mostly cloudiness in the eyes, although he still runs and jumps at 80% or more of his original capacity).  Anyhoo, since one of the two we lost was Cutesie's primary playmate, our discussions about puppies had tended to center around finding her a suitable 'replacement', along the lines of a dachshund or such.  Fast forward to last Thursday afternoon.  I come home from work to find J has brought home from the pound -- not a puppy, and not a dachshund, but a 3-year-old collie-beagle mix named Daisy.  Now Daisy is *extremely* well-behaved (her previous foster home was apparently a mix of cats and dogs, so she's used to that), and shows some evidence of having some obedience training: she understands some basic standard commands when on a leash, and is fairly well house-trained.  But you know there's adjustments ongoing.  The only one of our cats who's hissed at Daisy has been Cutesie (which was surprising, since Angel has always been the most ill-mannered of the lot -- actually, Angel is the only cat currently brave enough to stand nose-to-nose with Daisy) -- well, that's not counting the only near-dustup to date, when Daisy and Angel lunged for the same food bowl at the exact same instant, but that confrontation lasted about 1.5 seconds and, in the playground vernacular: "No blood, no harm, no foul." So now we're trying to re-educate the cats into eating and drinking from dishes on top of the kitchen table out of Daisy's reach (which, as one might imagine, is currently going over like an osmium dirigible...)  Nonetheless, we signed the papers for Daisy a couple of hours ago, so she's family now. So if I seem a bit more discombobulated than usual for a while, well, as that country song put it: "That's my story and I'm stickin' to it..."
