I am going to dinner with Katie and Andrea tonight, well we are going to have dinner over at andreas house and then head out to see shaolin soccer. It looks interesting but I think its mostly me and katie's style of fun. But who knows Andrea might really like it. Don't get me wrong I like Andrea a lot and she is katie's sister but I don't think she expresses her true feelings about stuff like that.   Any ways, I still haven't seen the posting for the job down in Huntington. I have mixed feelings about it. I don't want to leave Katie and Alec up here by them selves but then I have autumne, Jesse, Dale, Kyle, Tony, Kevin, Ed, Mike down there that I would really love to see again and hang out with. My first choice if I had a choice would be to move to Henderson to be with Aaron and Amanda. I would give any thing if I could but I know I know I cant right now because of the way the economy is and how hard it is to find a job there.
