Yeah, I could stick 'em off to the side of this page under "Links", but you know as well as I do that you won't click on them. Why bother if you don't know what they are, right? All right then, here we go...   urlLink  www.jeremy-smith.net   This is the newly launched "Official Website of Jeremy Smith", an up and coming guitarist on the Calgary music scene. Having been playing for more years than you've had that half-empty jar of tartar sauce in the back in your fridge, he's recently begun working on his first album. Check out the pics from his first-ever photo shoot (definite CD booklet material), view his ever-increasing collection of guitars, and listen to samples of his music.   urlLink  www.dreams2.com   For some of the best Macromedia Flash animation that I've ever seen, visit the site of Magnus Karlsson. Forget "Elf Bowling" or "Gerbil in a Microwave"... Magnus' talent for weaving together sights, sounds, and ideas will truly amaze you. Three different Flash intros will have you eager to check out the 30+ movies you'll find inside. In my opinion, "1979 (not as I expected)", "For the Love of the Game", and "Teenage Wasteland" are among the most impressive and moving pieces... Definitely worth a look.   urlLink  www.clint.ca   By far, one of the most clever and visually pleasing sites on the web today. The nearly tabloid style of the main page will have your eyes bouncing from funny quips to stunning original graphics, from off-the-cuff remarks to pictures that merely leave you wondering, "why?" But dig deeper and it gets even better. Clint Vander Klok's from-the-hip sense of humour and pointed social commentary will have you laughing away your coffee break.  And, finally, one last site that I have to give the  "Time Waster of the Month"  award to...   urlLink  http://home.tele2.fr/kcv/pinguin.swf   Unless your a member of Green Peace, you'll have a hard time resisting this little Flash game.  That's it for now. Happy surfing and don't forget to tell 'em Cuppojoe sent you!
