I sit down to watch the DNC, and who is speaking, Barack Obama?   Following that remarkable performance, I would like to state for the record so that you can all say you heard it hear first, Barack Obama, the DNC's keynote speaker who is running for Senate in Ill. will be the first black nominee for President of the USA. Democrat or Republican, I can honestly admit I have never heard a public speech in a national forumn quite like that.   There is a reason Republican Senator Peter Fitzgerald retired and GOP nominee Jack Ryan removed himself from the race, they wouldnt hack it. Now in true form, the Democrats will blow it by allowing Ron Reagan speak on a detailed scientific discussion and Teresa Heinz just show herself...God I love politics.   Even you JP, cant argue that it was not a moving speech
