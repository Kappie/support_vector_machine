There appears to be an advanced market in all resources when the global market place is considered. Allocations of resources and pricing are completed in a rapid manner, and effect all areas of production and consumption.   Competitive threats and opportunities are global in there source and disposition as well. With the effects of innovation and abundancies of resources felt immediately.  Or are they. My concern is that the standard of living experienced in North America and other advanced societies appears to be disproportionately higher then the standard of living realized in other regions of the world. In this efficent market, the Chinese producer has a competitive advantage over their more advanced competition in that they can access lower labor costs more easily.  If the supply of labor in China and India are as they are, does this not affect the labor market on an international basis? Is the standard of living the measure of comparitive advantage of an individuals productivity in the global market?  It therefore should be asked, how will the North American standard of living be sustained with the incremental supply of populations from China and India. Is the supply of human resources in a global market, not realized by the global market?
