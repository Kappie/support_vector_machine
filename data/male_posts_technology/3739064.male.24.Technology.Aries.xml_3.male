It comes down to this, I tend to let bad things go that happen because there is nothing I can do to change it. The only thing to get out of it is to not let it happen again. So next time something negative and non-drastic happens, understand immediately that  it's too late to stop it, just work on fixing it.  This leads to something people wonder about with me; Anger. People RARELY see me angry.  let's look at one of anger's instigators: Jealousy, for example.   My most meaningful ex-girlfriend started dating one of my friends. Yes, I was quite pissed for a week. Then I started talking to them, and eventually hanging out with them. I'd estimate 95% of people out there would not accept this as normal behavior, but rather as torture. My answer is related my ability to let things go easily. Not that I don't care, but, I figure this: We broke up for good reasons. If I were to go start a war, it would make me no happier just more and more hateful as anger was exchanged. So my advice to anyone in a anger situation is to walk away. Or in my case, just accept what is and that fighting it would in no way benefit me.  I guess it all comes down to this belief I have: the only people I have a right to punish in this world are myself and my kids.    Well that covers anger, and why it's so rare with me.  Ok roomies, there is no oops god. I simply accept what happens immediatly rather than getting angry over it and prolonging the problem.  Have a weekend
