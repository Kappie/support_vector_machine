Telugu Ganga project :  The Krishna river water released from the Kandaleru reservoir in Andhra Pradesh reached the zero point near Uthukottai in Tamil Nadu, after covering a distance of 152 km, on February 16. It was to reach Poondi and then course 35 km down the Baby Canal to the Red Hills reservoir for being treated and ferried in tankers. But such hopes evaporated on February 18 with the Poondi canal remaining dry. Illegal tapping of water by farmers and the drawal of water to meet the demands of Tirupati town in Andhra Pradesh were offered as the reasons for the virtual non-arrival of the Krishna water in the Poondi canal.    New Veeranam Project  : The scheme was being implemented without affecting irrigation in the existing ayacut. By raising the lake bund by 0.6 metres, its capacity had been raised from 930 mc ft to 1,485 mc ft, she said. This and other steps taken to augment the lake's capacity would result in the availability of water going up from 11.06 tmc ft to 14.45 tmc ft, she said. Of the additional 3.39 tmc ft, only 2.45 tmc ft would be used for the New Veeranam Project.     Desalination plants  : Nuclear plant at kalpakkam already  urlLink has one  with a capacity of 6 million litres. Whereas one that is  urlLink planned for chennai  by Mr. P. Chidambaram is for 300 million litres capacity.  My biggest worry is these desalination plants needs fuel for its operation.
