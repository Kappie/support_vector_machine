Alas, I'll have to wait until next year to find out what happens.  I think the only series I'm watching now is  Frasier , and this season has slipped quite considerably.  Thank God for  Dead Ringers .  Ah, forgot about  Angel , about the only series I'm watching at the moment that has a hint of sci-fi about it.  Bring back  Babylon 5 !  Just watched  Jurassic Park III .  It was alright, and had some great references to the previous movies, but the effects looked very "tired".  The plane bit at the start looked positively wooden... on par with the helicopter crash in  DNA !  Tried to get my hair cut today, only to find the damn place was closed.  Also chanced walking through not one but two of my local parks... and was not accosted once.    Makes a change from December 1994.
