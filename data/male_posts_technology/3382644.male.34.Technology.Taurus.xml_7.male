The play was good and fun.  I played a little more aggressive tonight which seemed to help.  I played hands that I would have normally folded to the odds and stats.  It worked out for me.  I took 3rd in a pretty good match up.  My final hand I was in the double blinds with a Kd 7d.  I checked the guy in the small blinds and the flop came out.  I flopped a pair of kings and felt pretty good about the hand.  I went all in with the rest of my $320.  He called me and the cards came up.  He had a K 8.  Figures.  And to close the deal for sure, an 8 came out on the river.  That was it for me.  It was the right play but it just didn't work out for me.  A good game overall.  Indiana Slim
