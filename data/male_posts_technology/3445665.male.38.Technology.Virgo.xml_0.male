Traffic was heavy and it took a long time to get to work today, at least an hour and a half.  Got here just in time for a Bug Triage meeting.  Then we had an engineering meeting.  Finally got in my book claim in for a few books I bought a couple of weeks ago.  We still aren't sure exactly what needs to be done in what order, but we do have a good picture of what our platform needs to look like in a years time.  So now we just have to have a few meetings to hammer out the details.
