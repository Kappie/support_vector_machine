I had a good time, it was a laugh, although i do now have a significent leg injury inflicted by the charming and lovly but highly dangerous and violent LORA. Anyway, it was a good film, and good to have a night out.  I will probally spend tommrow in school, because we have a huge show to put on in 3 weeks!  Will blog properly when i find some time, hope you are all well, see you soon. Dave
