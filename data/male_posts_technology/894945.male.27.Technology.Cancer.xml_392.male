Then celebrated my achievements by going to watch the Two Towers at the new cinema.  PK asked me which one I liked the best the first or second? I told her it’s all one story and I liked the first 2/3 of it so far.  I’m not thinking of it as three separate films.  (I honestly think she would be disappointed if I gave her a straight answer).  For those of you who don’t know I’m really fussy when it comes to food.  I don’t really eat any Vegetables and my diet consists mainly of Meat dishes or Cheese and Marmite toasties.  PK however is a vegetarian and hates Marmite (Weirdo)… this has made cooking for her really interesting (They do say opposites attract).  I’m trying to find dishes without meat or vegetables in it so if you have any ideas please e-mail me.  If I find stuff that is really nice I’ll even post it here for everyone to see.  I’m going to start a topic for discussion each week on our message board that anyone can join in on.  This week is going to be about Cat’s or Dog’s, which pet you prefer and why.
