And that sounds like a message from heaven and the most beautiful music from godess~~~~~~   Guess I'll slack the last two days off then ^_^   Hmm... that sounds too unresponsible... I'll try to finish my work.   I won't let him down.   Wait... was that reverse psychology???   So should I slack or not?   Eh... probably ... i don't know... depends on my mood...
