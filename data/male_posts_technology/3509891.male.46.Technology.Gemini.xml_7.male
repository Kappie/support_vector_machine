Well, I have sent in my first homework assignment, and am waiting for it to be returned, graded.  In the mean time, I have started work on my next assignment.  This one is on the law documents of ancient civilizations.  It sounds more in-depth then it really is.  It's really a comparetive essay.  My co-worker (grouppy? fan? agent?) is pressing me for the first chapter of my book.  She has set a deadline for it.  Conflicting deadlines.  Just what this blog was meant to address.  But then, if I don't make use of it, how is it supposed to help?  I have a two week vacation coming up, so I hope to make use of that to catch up on my writing.  But that's just another way of postponing it, isn't it?  So I had better get going at it now.
