Far-fetched, sci-fi you say?  Isn't that the reason for going to the movies?  To escape reality?  My former roommate and very good friend Theo Risinger was with us also.  He just finished getting his Masters in teaching from  urlLink Trinity University ;  the same school I got my bachelors in Computer Science at.  He has been one of the most trusting, non-judgmental and loyal friends I have in my life.  He had to be to live with me for two years (one year in the dorms and one in an apartment).  Theo then came over and finally saw my apartment.  Christie busted her butt today and cleaned the apartment.  There are so many times in this relationship with her that I ask myself, "Why do you deserve her?".  I got her a massage at Bali Spa yesterday.  60 mins for $60.  She's been there before and said that it was awesome.  I just know that with the wedding, the stress is adding up.  I know it has been for me.  Had a hacker get into a doc's computer this week.  They uploaded a good number of full blown pirated DVDs.  It took his D: drive from 55 free Gigabytes to 11 free Gigabytes.  Once I deleted them and reset the passwords, the loss of space stopped and the doc was able to resume work.  fun fun.  Hope all is well with you all.
