Everytime I give old William a chance he seems to throw it back in my face. This film is an absolute waste of time. His acting? Stiff. The effects? Half the film looks like a damn cartoon; it won't exactly make you leave the cinema making comparisons to Lord of the Rings or even Wallace and Grommitt for that matter! The story? There is one there somewhere but who gives a crap after you consider the first two points.  I personally believe ol' William Smith whould have stuck to his trusty Fresh Prince of Bel Air. The program was made for him and it showed. As soon as he hit the big screen I believe he has been unable to adjust his acting appropriately. I'm no hater though I give credit where it is due and William was excellent in Ali which is what lead me to pay Â£6.50 (well Â£3.25 thanks to Orange Wednesdays) for this film.  But this time I swear, had on my heart, I will never go to see another Will Smith movie again.
