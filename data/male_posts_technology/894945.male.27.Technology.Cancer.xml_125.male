Baity hated it, even though it had legions of demonic hordes in it, must be his hay fever. I thought it rocked. Samatha Mumba... yum.  Had a nice BBQ on sunday, me and a friend of Scott's bought little water pistols for the kids... and then busted out of £25 super soaker, causing chaos in the bouncy castle and over the sausages.  I can't see what all the fuss is over the Queen's Jubilee.  Stupid amounts of people standing around the capital, just gagging for the old girl to stick her head out of her balcony.  So she comes out, with a not-so-bright-slightly-pissed-off experession on her face, waves a couple of times and the crowd go FUCKING WILD!  What's the point? She should at least have done a strip-tease, or some cabaret or something.  Prince Philip is a god though.  Here are some of his pearls of wisdom:  (On receiving a gift from a Kenyan native woman) "You are a woman aren't you?.." (To a Cayman Islander) "Aren't most of you descended from pirates?.." (To a British ex-pat in Hungary) "You can't have been here that long, you haven't got a pot-belly yet.." (To a Scottish driving instructor) "How do you keep the natives from being inebriated long enough to pass their test?.." (To a blind woman with a guide dog) "Do you know they have eating dogs for the anorexic now?" (To British students in China, during the 1986 state visit) "If you stay here much longer, you'll all be slitty-eyed."    Wit sharper than a pimp's suit - HRH Prince Philip.
