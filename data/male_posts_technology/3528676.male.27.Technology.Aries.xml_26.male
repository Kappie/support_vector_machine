Th movie starts out with Ford  (kinda ironic for someone who rides a bike, a little irony in there for sure)   the fastest rider in "ever" coming back to the USA from Thailand presumably because he was from the government and gets mixted up with some bikers called the Hellions led by Ice Cube's character Trey. Ice Cube's brother Jr. gets killed by Henry James the leader of a rival muscle bike group but pins it on Ford. Ford has to prove his innocence by, guess what, out-racing everyone else for the evidence. Dont get me wrong.  These kinds of films don't really get a lot of accolades for their writing or story development.  But the people who did this movie could have done better and breathed life into the story instead of...say put more bikes. Sub plots like the family conflict in  Biker Boyz  and the morality check in  Fast and the Furious  gave a little meat in their respective stories at least.  One guilty pleasure would probably be the showdown between Monet Mazur and Jame Pressley. When you see two chicks beating the crap out of each other while on their bikes, you know your in for a treat.  If you're out to get the DVD, I just hope you like bikes, because it's all you will get...oh and girls.
