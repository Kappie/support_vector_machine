How else would I rate all that has happened to me over the last two months. I fail a course I shouldn't have which eventually delayed my graduation. In less than a week I lose my job for no concrete reason. Then I begin to lose someone I love with all my heart. Yes, I poured it all out and gave it all I can for she deserved nothing less than the best in life. For once, I was genuinely happy with a girl. I truly was happy. I  have this tendency to change myself for the other person. But with her, it was just me, it was Pradeep all along. But that was short lived too. She wanted bring down the curtains. Until date I don't know the reason for it or atleast something that I can come close to believing. It was like a seesaw, moving up and down. And today, a day that I will remember for the rest of my life, I saw it all come crashing down. I gave her what she asked for. It made her very happy and so I stopped questioning my decision. But believe me when I say that this was by far the most difficult decision of my life. I told her that we should go our separate ways. Tears trickled down as I wrote those few lines to her. The pain within  me was unbearable. I wished I was dead. Yes, I really did wish I were dead. I am not writing this out of frustration. I am trying to very calm and composed at the moment. I prayed to Him all along asking him to give me the strength to do whatever I was doing because I had not the strength to do it on my own.  The only saving grace was that she seemed very happy. Well, that was the very reason I even came to this conclusion. I could see her slipping away from me; new friends, new reasons. I don't get to talk to her as much. But I still do care; still worried if she ate, did she reach home safe, did she sleep well, yes I still do care. And I am at this moment shedding tears as I write this posting. But I still stand by my statement, "Sairoo is the sweetest girl I've met all my life".
