Although, she deserves  so  much more than just a single rose. Sigh... She's so...sigh... Lyric time!  Kjell and Jackso Coming Home  "Tired of being on the road, I'm coming home tonight. I may walk all night, but I'll make it home before sunrise.  Don't wait up for me, I've got a ways to go. Broken, and tired, but I will make it home.  I'm coming home, I'm gonna bring you a single rose. It might not be much,  but it is all I've got. I can't afford much else, and I've run out of clean socks."      God. Anyways, I'm leaving for now, but Kelly will  never  suspect that there will be a suprise attack of some sorts on her tommorow at one! MWAHAHAHA!!!  Don't you hate movies where the badguy gives away the plot, and then leaves the hero alone to escape from them and crush their evil plans? I do. Whatever. Lates.
