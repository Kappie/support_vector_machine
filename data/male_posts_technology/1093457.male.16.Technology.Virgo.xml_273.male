Anyway, blog more later, gtg to a music lesson now!  OK I'm back. Well today was a bit of a bizarro day. Firstly those stupid questionairres that we spent most of the day devising stupid answers to. Then something else funny happened, and I can't even remember what it was now. DAmmit. But yes, and odd day in all. Boring music leesson, got into trouble for not having done enough work. Yipeee. MOre school tomorrow, can't say I'm looking forawrd to it. I was going to bring my camera tomorrow, but it looks like it's going ot rain so I don't think I will now!
