Well, I basically used one of those thumbnail thingies so its easier for people to glance through them.  The hardest files were the meet photos, but, thankfully, its all done now.  The only thing is that I'm going to have to do still is upload the videos and sort through those.  I haven't quite decided how I'm going to do that so we'll see...  In other news, things are slowly calming down here. I'm starting to feel somewhat better although if it would rain and the heat would go away it would make it a lot easier.  Something about hot weather just makes me feel a bit crankier.  Apparently, we're not expecting and cooler weather till Sunday.  Blah!  I think its just because I hate cooking in such heat as well.  I like to leave things till later on days like these - like last night.  Adam and I walked along the highway to the end of Old Salmo road and walk up it.  It was really dark but so quiet and nice.  Thats the thing about this area though - its a small town and with that you can see almost every star on a clear night.  Thats what our hammock is for.  Late night, backyard cuddling :)  In the coming weeks I also will have the pain of shopping for a bathing suit.  I have no idea what happened to mine from last year (maybe left it at my dad's?) but now I need a new one.  Its a pain because its just impossible to find anything you like in a small town like this.  Well not totally impossible but it requires a lot of time and effort.  Lastly, Adam and I have decided to hold a meet here this coming October.  Surprisingly, we already have some good numbers signing up for it (even with some international people!).  Hopefully it will turn out as great as CAN2 did and with even more people.  We haven't even told all the locals yet so we'll see.  So please sign up if you're interested or even check out the website: http://canadameet.xtine.ca/  Now I need to lay down... see ya :)
