We had a bit of a tiff last night, but the usual, I was being a jerk and she didn't like it.  Who would.  I apologized and sometimes know that that is not enough.  I just hope that Christie knows just how much I love her and need her in my life.  I'm still having to realize that you only get one, maybe two chances if you are seriously lucky, at that TOTALLY AMAZING relationship.  I'm in mine.  I don't plan on going anywhere.  Here's to 2 years.  And to the future with my beautiful wife to be, Christina Armendariz.  ILY = I LOVE YOU (strictly for Christie)
