It is like an addiction that I haven't been able to get over yet.  I just wish that things between us were different.  In the back of my mind I know that they can't and that that is probably the best thing, but still for once can't it be like the movies!!!!  Whenever I get into this state of mind I tend to stay there for a while which is why I am listening to the Avril cd on my ipod.  "I don't forget you, oh its so sad...  I hope you can hear me... 'cause I remember it clearly... the day you slipped away, was the day I found it won't be the same...  I didn't get around to kiss you goodbye on the hand.... I wish that I could see you again... I know that I can't... I miss you"  Anyway, it seems that doing this is the only way that I can vent my frustration... I just don't feel happy in these times.  It is a combination of things and I know that whatever I say and whatever I do nothing is going to change.  And while you may consider that I am going to need thearpy for the rest of my life, sometimes people can have that kind of effect on someone.  Forgive please this moment of complete insanity... I temporarily have forgotten what it is that I have been doing to keep myself focused on what is more important that these absurd feelings.  I wish that there was something that she could do to help, but the only thing would be that she could possibly feel the same about me... and that is just not going to happen... ever... And who could blame her because of me writing stuff like this... I mean, let's just face it, I am still obsessed with her.  Granted that I don't think about her all the time.  All that I have to hope for is to someday be able to see her again and to spend some time with her.  I keep thinking of all that I did wrong and all that I do wrong with writing stuff like this and it really pains me.
