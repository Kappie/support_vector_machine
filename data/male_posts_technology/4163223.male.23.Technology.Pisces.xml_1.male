Riddick (Vin Diesel) is a most-wanted fugitive, being searched by a number of planetary systems. He is being hunted all the time by mercs (mercenaries) who are looking for a prize. While saving his own ass, and kicking asses of such mercs he ends up at the planetary system of Helion Prime.  Where he meets one of the Elementals (those who calculate future using probability, we havent got such people right now I think, but the concept is not bad) , who make him realize that part of him which he has forgotten. That he is a survivor of planet Furia, that he is a Furian.  Helion Prime in the meanwhile is under the threat of attack from the Necromancers (a breed of people led by the Lord Marshal, how is half human and half something-that-nobody-knows-what-he-is). Their motto is "You keep what you kill !", a very bold faith which leads to some interesting dialogue scenes in the movie.  In the events that follow we see a lot of great action sequences especially the ones on the triple security prison on planet Crematoria. The movie proceeds in a good speed, great special effects and amazing scenes. It is a must watch for all sci-fi action movie fans.  PS : The theatre we visited was Plaza. It is a no go ! Pathetic screen, pathetic sound, pathetic movie print. But if u have no other choice, I suggest take the cheapest tickets at least you will be nearer to the screen to listen to the sound.
