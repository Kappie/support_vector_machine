       I guess I'm hungry. I know not because I feel hungry, but because I haven't eaten since I woke at 11:00 and made my first post today and my stomach is starting to knot up. Waves of pain come, relieved by belching or a solid gurgle. The pain is right in the middle of my body, width wise, and situated just below my sturnum at the top of my stomach muscles. This is why I believe I have an ulcer. Eating helps, as does Zantac 75 eventually. The problem is that eating causes my other symptoms, which are worse.  urlLink Catch 22 .  

 Off to lunch...
