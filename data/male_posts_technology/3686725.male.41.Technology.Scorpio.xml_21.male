Had to google it out for myself and I believe I found the very story Randi was reading from.  I'm telling you, I am not one for hyperbole outside of its humorous uses but this administration is starting to scare me.  This one-party government is starting to look like another single-party government I remember whose steriod-inbued athletes would wear the "CCCP" on their hairy chests (and that was the women).  Check it out fer y'self:  urlLink News-Leader.com | Opinions | Bush rally was sad day for democracy   In the spirit of integrity it should be noted that the writer is a member of the "Peace Network of the Ozarks" so one might assume a rather left-leaning slant.  Still, it's the facts that scare me; no interpretation necessary.
