Arsenal may lose their captain and best central midfielder but considering he missed about a quarter of last season and the Gunners were still undefeated Arsenal have shown they can cope with such a big loss. No hard feelings towards "La Grande Saucisse" regardless of what happens over the next couple days. In a time of mercenary players he and most of Arsenal have stuck together through good and bad. Good luck Vieira, just don't take Henry with u next season!
