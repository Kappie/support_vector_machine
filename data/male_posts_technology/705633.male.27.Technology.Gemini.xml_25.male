Good news, one of my fellow swordsman, Mark 'Custard' Ashford will now be posting onto the site as well, so you have the comments of two idiots to read now. Expect a 'Mark about page' coming soon, complete with photos of our recent exploits around St Helier... off to Follies tonight, free entry.. just the way we like it.
