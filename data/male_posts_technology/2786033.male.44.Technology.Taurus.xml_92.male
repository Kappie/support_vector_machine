Downtown Eugene citizens will be celebrating with well-thought out, respectful opposition to  the president   the war  life as we know it as a show of solidarity with France.   For next year, when all of you will be our 'unofficial minions', we need ideas for our counter protest. Examples:  1. Carry white flags.  2. We will have face-painting for the kids, but the only thing we can paint is tears.   Leave your ideas in the comments.  I  knew  I should have bought a  urlLink Frank J  'Fun facts about he French' shirt.
