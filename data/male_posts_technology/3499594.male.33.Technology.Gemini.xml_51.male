I was on-call all weekend but it wasn’t nearly as bad as I had feared.   For work I had to run 3 olie scripts. An olie script is a neat little program that allows you to paste repetitive keystrokes within the ordering/registering system at work. So rather than a person entering in 1000 charges, you can set this bad boy up to enter them for you. Not everyone knows it, so it was deemed to me to do it. A hospital had contacted us about 2 weeks ago to request help entering in nearly 2.4 million bucks of charges from April through June that were missed. Eek gad.   So I wrote the script and attempted to run it. But it wouldn’t run on my P.C. Stupid thing kept dying on me. So the PC LAN group was able to set up a PC at Corp (in Pennsylvania) and set it up to allow me to PCAnywhere into it (from Oklahoma). I placed my files and script on that machine and ran it from there. It was good I could. We had thunderstorms Friday and Saturday and it kept disconnecting my connection to Corp. But the script remained running on the machine at Corp. Pretty cool, eh?   Of the 3 scripts (April, May, and June) I ran, May was the largest. It had over 18 thousand charges to enter. Needless to say it ran nearly 23 hours. Yes, I stayed up late babysitting it. But by Sunday morning / Saturday night they were done. While this ran, my wife organized the house out. She and I (mostly she) cleaned out all the closets, rooms ECT. Since it rained nearly all day.   Sunday we went to church and then I ran to grab a 16 inch July 4th Cookie from the Cookie Company. A couple with their 2 kids came over and we ate together. The kids played in the backyard in the pool (large pump kind, you find at Wal-Mart now). I brought out the water guns and the fun really began. The wives stayed in the house (chickens) while Erich and I first fought the kids then each other we were all drenched. We had a blast. My wife and I did manage to play some more tether ball, but she beat me again. Oh well.   Then at night we popped our fireworks and watched the neighbors as well. The friends didn’t leave till 10:30 p.m. We pretty much crashed after that. I didn’t get called but maybe 5 times all weekend. It was nice.  Monday we were off and I was not on-call. Alma, Arkansas has a small water park we had not known. So we took the kids over there and played for nearly 2 hours. It wasn’t bad at all. We had a blast and I was pleased to see the kids (5, 6 yrs old) go down the large water slides with no problem, alone! Cool.   That’s my weekend in a nutshell. Hope everyone enjoyed there’s.
