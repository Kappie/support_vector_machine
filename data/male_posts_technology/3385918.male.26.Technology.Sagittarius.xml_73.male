Just that I really have a lot of work to do, plus I am currently working on four (not one, not two or even three!) screenplays. Which, btw, are coming along real nice. Might even start another one in two weeks. Which means I have to finish at least one or two ASAP.   So, expect the reviews a little later than usual. Also, a little shorter. Have to get these out quick, before the work load starts to pile up. Right now, I'm actually late with a few things, so I better get this show going.   This will be a really easy show to review, since there were only two long events and some of the Diva contest stuff.   We start out with a Diva elimination. Which is always a good way to get people to change the channel. A Diva gets cut from the list and, well, people just don't care.   I will go on record in saying that the only person there that looks to be Diva material is the red head (I think her name is Christy). In fact, she looks damn sexy and happy to be there in front of the crowd. The other girls look awkward, embarrassedand uninspired. So, I'm sure the fans, those that give a damn about this crap, will single her as the winner. If not, the WWE is going to have another flop on it's hands cause all the other girls don't fit in.   Next we had a battle royal, over the top, elimination match. Damn, these things are fun. Repetitive, but fun. Pretty good stuff, with Flair, Orton, Batista, Edge, Jericho, Kain and Rhyno being the highlights. I swear, Batista and Kain should be given a longer match together. These guys feel like they want to feud and people know it. Anyway, the final segments between Orton and Jericho were brilliant. Sure, we net fans knew that Orton would win, but it still played out very well.   Interesting choice having Orton go against Benoit at Sumer Slam. This is an honor. I think Orton worked hard for this. Sure, he might not be ready, yet. Then again, maybe he is. This is the best way to find out. I have a feeling that Orton has a great wrestler in him and that he is ready to step up to the plate. As for the news that he might actually win... well... That's a different story.   I know that they are thinking that having Randy Orton on top would make him a quick star and breath life into theRAW main event (which is stupid cause Benoit isdoing fine by himself), but this is an honor that Randy Orton hasn't yetto win. Yes, he is main event caliber. Yes, he has the look and the skill, but he is to young.Also, just look at all the sweat and punishment Benoit had to go through toreceive the honor of being WWE Champion. To loose that to Orton, who just got here? It's not right. Benoit is an excellent wrestling champion.   Orton is good, but not that good. Has potential to being another flop if a title is puton him.   Also, this might just be an excuse to have HHH and Randy Orton feud so HHH can win the title back. Which would suck RAW eggs!   HHH should no longer be champion. He's had his run.Keep him away from the title.   That said, the 60 minute Iron Man match between HHH and Benoit was excellent. These two guys still have it. No one can deny this, HHH is one hard worker. Heck, probably one of thehardest working wrestler in the roster. Both these guys arestill in their prime (even thought I have a feeling that they have so much pride, that they will always try to give 100% even thought their bodies are screaming "rest home").   The rest of the Evolution members, except Orton (...Interesting...), step in and beat down Benoit nearing the end of the match. Eugene steps in and cleans house, plus helps Benoit win, thereby securing a HHH vs. Eugene match at Summer Slam. This is a good thing cause it keeps HHH in the PPV scene, but without the championship, plus helps put over talent. This is a great idea, especially taking into consideration that Eugene is that bad gimmick that actually, miraculously, worked. The WWE knows this is a fluke, but they have to milk it for all it's worst. We will have to see how this pans out.   That said, this show was pretty good. Even the Diva stuff was entertaining (if only to show that almost all of these girls don't have what it takes to be WWE Divas). Only two wrestling events, but they were fun, entertaining and exciting. I will give this show an A-. Yep, a high grade. I liked this show very much. Two solid gimmick matches that kept people interested.   I would like to comment more, but right now I am very close to loosing my job, soI'll leave it here. See ya next Tuesday. I hope...    urlLink Sailor Ecchi
