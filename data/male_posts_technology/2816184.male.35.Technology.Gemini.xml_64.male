I was poking around in Yves' library and found out that there was a fellow named 'Maplethorpe' there.  He was, (is?) an agent of Tatiacha, Archangel of Trees.  I haven't seen Tatiacha in ages.... *shakes head* Anyway...Maplethorpe was there in the late 1700's.  Wound up in American history books for some work he did during their revolution."
