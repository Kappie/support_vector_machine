This vulnerability could allow a file to be saved in a target location on the user's system if the user clicked a link. No dialog box would request that the user approve this download.   - A vulnerability that involves the incorrect parsing of URLs that contain special characters. When combined with a misuse of the basic authentication feature that has "username:password@" at the beginning of a URL, this vulnerability could result in a misrepresentation of the URL in the address bar of an Internet Explorer window.
