A few years after moving from Califoria, Dr. Wenning went to serve at  urlLink Bel Air Presbyterian Church , near where the Reagan's had their ranch.   I saw his picture again today on the  urlLink front page of Boston.com , as he presided over Ronald Reagan's memorial service in California at the presidential library. I remember Michael and his wife as amazingly kind people, and as great friends of my parents. I am sure that he is providing a world of comfort to Mrs. Reagan and her family.
