After basketball practice, I was sitting there waiting for the team to finish getting changed so I could kick them out of the gym.  On the other side of the court, Mr. Hunter had left the high jump pits up.  So, just to see if I could still do it, I tried the high jump.  My first jump was fairly clean, albeit at a really weak height of 1.4 metres.  So then it was put a little higher, and since I could never really do more than 1.7 in my peak, an out-of-shape me was worried I wouldn't clear the height.  So I took off really fast and went about as high as I could.  I totally cleared the bar, but even during takeoff, something felt weird.  It was on my way down that I realised I had taken two extra steps and had absolutely no chance of landing on the mat.  So here I am, on my way down, going "OH SHIT!" as I land neck first directly onto the gym floor.  So basically I jumped, had my ass and feet about 4 and a half feet in the air, and landed squarely on my neck.  Needless to say, it's kinda tough to move it today.
