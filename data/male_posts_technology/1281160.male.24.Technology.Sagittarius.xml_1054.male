Yes, its VasantaHabba, the popular "Festival of Spring".   It is a dusk to dawn programme with Dance and Music forming the glory of the time. Celebrated every first Saturday of February, this was its 13th year.   The first half of the day/night starts around 6 o'clock, filled with stunning performances of some professional and some to-be professional ensembles of three different dance schools and goes on till midnight.  The next half sings about music and only music.   This year the performers who stole the stage were stalwarts in their own schools. It was like all under one roof or u can call it as a Dance and Music supermarket, where in they hosted a variety of concertos to pickup, which no other event can boast about.  Nrityagram, the Dance school which hosts Vasantahabba, aims at not only bringing Classical / refined forms of art to public, but also the basic forms such as folk dances into the premises of the public. So did it start with patronising  "Dollu kunitas" where the Dancers do dance and create a pattern of music with their big drums, which they carry. Full of Raw energy, really it was amazing to see them perform with good beats and heats of sound with uniformity.   Then on the line-up awaited us, the Village Ensemble, where in the children, belonging to the nearby places of Nrityagram, did give a really impressive program. Yes, first was the school of Odissi students on the go. The uniformity, the costume, the expressions were something so good, that one would really fall in love with Odissi, at the very site of its performers.  Kathak, is one more form of dance which was displayed with village children, is unique in its own way with lots of twists and turns and as any dance form, needs to have a subtle expressiveness more in account and so did the performance too was.  Bharathanatyam - Bha - "Bhava", Ra - "Raga", Tha - "Thala". So, there were all the three elements of dance in the presentation to us.  Village Ensemble did prepare us for the heavy dance feast waiting for us. First, started the Bharathnatyam performance by Priyadarshini Govind, who took us to various moods under different themes of her performance.   While she went from her Main act on Devi's Samhara of Demon, It did kill the demons out there, and as a symbol of victory, brought in rains too. Rain was the pleasant surprise visitor and she did invite it with a dance of inviting Krishna to a devotee's consort. She did insist on dancing in Lord Varuna's(lord of Rain)abode and so, the visitor had to get back, when she performed an excellent piece on Lord Shiva. The tailpiece of Vande Mataram, did tie everyone to the motherland! Nevertheless the audiences were the most enthusiastic of all times.  In Odissi, The movements are so graceful that, it gives a feel that, its more feminine. It was hard to believe the All-male Odissi performance of Dasavathara-The ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu by the native performers of Orissa.   High spirits that had risen was then subdued by a martial art and classical contemporary dance mix up performance by Astad Deboo. Of course, initially, it was not so legible, to much of the audience, coz of the subtle and fragmental movement, but its the high degree of control to exhibit such movements was the one which kept the audience tied up to the show.  Oops, a Bhangda then to make u smell the wheat after harvest......... It was a surprise act and so did the audience liven up to the performance. Meanwhile a trailor of what’s going to be the performance in 2005 from Odissi dance school was played to lure the dance enthusiasts, the next year too. Oh, lots of variety in dance and the time now has  flew to Midnight and was time for Music concerts to start.   The first artist in that section was the all time audience favourite, Bombay Jayshree. So calm and composed was her concert, with few beautiful embellishments like Nannu palimpa, Krishna nee begane, and et al. Of course how would the audience leave such a sweet artist who hasn’t fussed to get herself booked at a midnight slot, without asking once more? yes, they did so, and so did she sing one more thillana to quench their desire!   Then was a Sitar-Violo cello duet concert which was a feast to the audience ears. The music of Sitar is so vibrating and it, blended with the customised coarse sound of Violo cello, kept the audience awake till the end. "mile sur mera tumhara" is what the artist told and started playing once again, when the audience asked one more!  Followed by it was Kadri Gopalnath's Sax concert where in he really lived up to the audience by playing lots of familiar pieces like Alaipauthey, Kurai ondrum illai, Brahma mokhate, Krishna nee begane et al.   Antaragini was a Bangalore local band, gone to international level in their performance these days and they were the ones to touch the audience next. Great was their, effort to keep the audience live by giving some enthuse pieces of music. Ya, they were also, no exceptions to audience' "one more" request and had to abide them by singing one of their most sought after piece, "Mysore se".   Last in the line up was "Indian ocean", a kind of fusion music which we dint find time to witness, coz of time constraint.  Oh, how many performances and all performances were not less in anyway and unique in their own way and my god, i can't imagine how they managed to organise and coax performers for midnight and after midnight slots in the chill weather of Bangalore. Whistles and applause were some of the best gifts, which all artists would never, forgot to take from the audience. For all those artists, who were accustomed to disciplined fans, these kind of casual fans must have been a different ambience altogether. And the audience were one of the most unique, with people thronging from all parts of B'lore and from villages near by, climbing on wall, near by trees and what not, to get a glimpse of what’s going on.....   With a fond memory of having witnessed an excellent event, i await for the next year celebration too.
