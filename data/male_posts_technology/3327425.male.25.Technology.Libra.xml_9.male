While I was down and nearly out, I read a book, "Dark Rivers of the Heart" by Dean Koontz.  Actually I re-read the book.  It was originally published in 1995, which is when I originally read it (I was 16/17 at the time).  At that time, I didn't fully comprehend the seriousness of the plot.  At that time, it was a wildly imaginative, government-run-a-muck adventure story.  Re-reading it this past week, after much more social and political awareness, I am astounded at the profoundness of the novel.  It's a fictional story of two individuals on the run from a government agency intent on bringing them down.  The central theme of the book revolves around the slow erosion of the Bill of Rights and how the government and its agencies are using their new "power" to control the country.    One of the side plots points out the forfeiture laws made popular by the War on Drugs.  In case you aren't aware, this law allows the police/FBI/ATF/DEA or any other law enforcement agency to seize property at a whim.  No conviction necessary.  No warrant necessary.  No charges even need to be filed.  And no "innocent until proven guilty."  Just take it and run.  You could even be found "not guilty" and STILL NOT get your stuff back after it has been seized.  Reading this novel at 16/17 years old, it didn't have quite the meaning it has today.  Then, my main concern was if I was going to the prom, and whom I would ask (for the record, I didn't end up going).  Reading it now, got me thinking (again) at how screwed up our society has become.  It's screwed up enough to allow human beings (to my knowledge that is the species that make up every law enforcement agency) with all our flaws, to seize private property (houses, bank accounts, jewelry, etc) and there's nothing the "victim" can do about it.  To make matters worse, the government actually encourages more of this action by cutting budgets from these law enforcement agencies and telling them to seize more property (of which the seizing authority gets to keep a percentage if not all of the money garnered from the assets).  This is a multi-million dollar industry!  So when the police department needs a little extra cash, then can run to their neighborhood, seize some property, and then say "oops, sorry we made a mistake."  At which point it is up to the citizen to sue the department and prove his/her innocence to get their property back (or cash equivalent).  Meanwhile the house has been sold at auction and the money appropriated.  It could take years to get anything back for that citizen.  Plus, even if that citizen is found not guilty, thier STUFF could still be legally held because IT (the stuff) may be guilty of a crime (for example, if I have a party and someone brings drugs to my house, they could seize my house and not give it back even if I had nothing to do with it, because my house could be viewed as a "distribution" point).  Fortunately, some of the states have been peeling back the teeth of this portion of the war on drugs.  Some, but not all.  Back to the book.  It is a really well written book, and highly entertaining.  I would recommend checking it out if your up for a good read.
