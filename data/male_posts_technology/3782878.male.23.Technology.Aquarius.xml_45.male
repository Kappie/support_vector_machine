So I shrugged, and it lingered. Today this morning while I was loafing before making it to work ON TIME! woohoo! it began to speak. Turns out it's a fellow blogger *wave to blogger* and is a Shadowrun Fan. I know I haven't talked about Shadowrun before on my blog, but let me put it this way, it's one of the coolest Tabletop Roleplaying Games I've played. It's what got me started in the whole sordid RPG community when I was in the military. It's a game of corporate espionage with heavy weapons, equally or better armed resistance, and Stealth. Some people run quick shoot em ups because they like action. Me personally, I'm a stealth afficianado(hence why I like hitmen, snipers, ninjas, hackers, and thieves in games)  so I like to force my players to use their noggin, by drawing up elaborate failures when stealth is not used, and sometimes, just for fun, I make an easy one that is a shoot em up, just to watch them avoid it. I've found in past with some players that a simple shoot em up or a poorly planned stealth run can be shot to hell with but 1 player. The ever present First Person Shooter loving Min/Max'er who has a character so well built that grenades land at his feet and he just stands there and continues shooting, because he can soak the damage all the way down to nothing. These people destroy that kind of game. But anyway, I just wanted to wave out to that guy, and say it's glad to see someone besides 5 other people read these things! especially since nobody ever comments on them on the site :(  Anyway, another part of today's topic, I keep having this weird flash of an idea that flies through my head, of an angel being shot at, going incorporeal, and laughing. I'm actually thinking about writing a story about this angel, maybe a screenplay or something. it's pretty cool, and using that seed I built up an entire little action comedy idea in my head about a Malakim superhero. If you notice my handle I go by on here is Phoenix Malakai. I took Malakai from a distortion of Malakim, which according to a French RPG I used to play is one of the choirs of angels. The malakim as the ones that God sends out as his mighty vengeance against evil. They are the only angels that are permitted to kill to get their jobs done, whereas other angels can only kill demons. The malakim wear black wings, and are the only angels that have never had one of their choir fall from grace and become on of the many ranks of demons in Hell. I always thought that Malakim's would be serious bad asses, taking no crap from anyone except god. God sent them to each to punish the sinner's, and that's what they do, no matter who or what gets in the way of that ideal. So maybe when I get the time I'll start jotting some short hand notes on that project. Anyway time for lunch I have to send my mom and email apologizing that I missed her B-day AGAIN :( I suck. Anyway  Try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix
