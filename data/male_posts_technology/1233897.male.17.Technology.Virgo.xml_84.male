I had a bit of a cough on Tuesday, and other than my chronic congestion, I didn’t think much of it… Then, I woke up at 7:30 am on Wednesday with a splitting headache and a temperature.  I went right back to sleep, and didn’t wake up until after 5:45 pm.  I was so dizzy, it’s not even funny – plus I was feeling sick to my stomach.  Amazingly, I stayed awake until almost 12:00 am.  But, when I woke up today I felt miserable again.  I thought I was doing better around this afternoon, and even told Gwen, when she dropped my homework assignments off, that I would be back in school tomorrow, now though, I know that’s not the case.  I hope this doesn’t linger into spring break – what with the two-day airsoft war planned and all… though, I may not have been able to go anyway because of my chronic congestion.  On Saturday, I spent six hours at the studio working on a show.  It was kind of weird working with the lighting and everything – we had to mask the identity of the person talking throughout the entire show, and it took almost two hours to set up the lighting in the correct fashion.  I went over to the Hakim’s house afterward, but couldn’t stay more than a couple hours because we had guests over at our house.  On Sunday, the 16th, I got a ride to and from Calvary with the Gadaholts, and had lunch with them. Before that, though, we met up with Ryan and Neil Castro (who also came over for lunch) and gave Ben a ride to his house. I spent a couple hours there, watching Christine, Timy and Neil playing some rather hilarious games of foosball, and marveling at the pace at which Ryan reads (though Kathleen can read faster). My parents came and picked me up around 3:00, leaving just enough time for me to get ready to go to Young Hee’s surprise party, host by Melissa, at 4:30. Not that many people were there compared to a week before (it was me *duh*, Melissa umm… *duh* again, Young Hee *I don’t like *duh*s anymore, Grace, Adrie, Daniel, Butters, and Gwen (who was working and arrived at 6:45).  I brought my two cameras (one video, one still) at Gwen’s request – since she would be arriving an hour and 45 minutes after Young Hee, after all. The party was fun until around 5:30, half an hour after Young Hee arrived, when something disturbing happened.  I rather suddenly sank into a huge state of depression - something that had only happened a few times before in my life.  I cheered up a bit again when Gwen arrived, but as soon as we started watching a movie (Rush Hour 2), I started feeling like the whole world was out to get me again.  I don’t think I ever want to see that movie again – I downloaded it off the web, and watched the first half hour of it again – with bad results. I didn’t start to feel better until about half an hour after the movie finished, and we were playing some random game (Mafia, I think). It’s really, really strange looking back on it.  I don’t recall much of what happened on Monday…  On Tuesday, I went to youth group, only to discover that it will be another two weeks before we (the youth group) can use the sanctuary again – stages just started setting up the set for their next play – Song on the Mountain.  After youth group, I decided to join of group of people (ten, including me), who want to learn more about evangelism, and still act as a sort of “support team” for each other.   Later that evening, I was talking to someone on im, and found out that I had really offended them at school that day, and I hadn't even realized it... that sort of didn’t let me sleep very easily that night.  Then the next day, and today, I was / am sick.  *joy*   u…huh   o, never mind.
