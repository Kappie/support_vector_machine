I remember seeing  urlLink the movie version from 1965  and being very disappointed - I hadn't read Pasternak's book but I had read  urlLink Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace  and had expected something along the lines of it. The movie was more than three hours but I still thought it too condensed. I don't really remember much than that about it. My displeasure may have been a result of me being to young.  This mini series however, while only clocking in at ca 30 minutes more in total screen time, still feels more complete. The characters are more well-rounded, making me feel for them more when tragedy hits them. Also, it stars  urlLink Keira Knightley , which is always a plus.  -->
