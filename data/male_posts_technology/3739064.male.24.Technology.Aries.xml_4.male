Since then I've been:  A) Reconciling our American express Statements B) Doing the dishes in a dishwasher that is broken. C) Mopping our kitchen because it flooded because people put large objects in the       disposal D) organizing the storage room. E) taking care of our plants. F) This. G) Planning to find a new job where I'm not the office Bitch.  My job's turned into about 80% catering/maintenance and about 20% IT. I vote that I should move on.  Ah yes, I just remembered why NOONE should work for a small business. ALL OF YOU HEAR ME? DON'T DO IT! Sometimes we're better off being just a number in a large corporation.  That's all I have to say about that.
