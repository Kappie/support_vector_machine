Now if the little alarm thingy on your ceiling is the only fire alarm you've ever heard, multiply it by a factor of, oh I don't know, a thousand maybe, to get a feel for how annoying the one from last night was.  We had to box up the cats "to-go" style; cats don't seem to enjoy that. Who wouldave thought! And, of course, there was the wonderful half an hour of awkward smiles that we spent with neighbors we'd been trying to avoid for the last year.  Turns out the whole affair was a bloody false alarm. I'm gonna buy me some ear plugs and sleep through it all the next time.
