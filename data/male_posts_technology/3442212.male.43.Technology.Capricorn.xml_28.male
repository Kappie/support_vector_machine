Some of the new design was nice. Some was tacky. Hogwarts felt  smaller  than in the last two movies, though I really like the more-mountainous setting.   Shame about the dress code.   It felt like there were things missing. They got all of the key items on the checklist, but couldn't linger on many of them. This movie has the feel of a longer movie that was snipped for running time.   If Michael Gambon had been cast as Dumbledore from the start, it would have been okay with me. But I missed Richard Harris. I'll get over it.   David Thewlis was just right as Professor Lupin.   Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint are growing as actors.   Being a British TV fan made some of the minor roles more fun to watch.   One Ringwriath costume can cover a whole platoon of Dementors.     I'll see this again, and look forward to the extended DVD.
