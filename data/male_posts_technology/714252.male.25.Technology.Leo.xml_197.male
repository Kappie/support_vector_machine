The most interesting one I got was from Gordon.  To be honest I can't remember the reading that well at all but one thing that sticks out in my mind is that I came away with a distinct impresion\memory of my hopes\fears which all relate pretty much directly to my feelings\emotions regarding relationships.. (wow, I just noticed how many times I used the '\' key in that sentence.. Freaky or what..)  Anyway, my big thing is a fear of relationships in general but at the same time a fear that I am going to end up alone.. I never really have trouble meeting people but I always end up alone again (or as alone as I ever get) and I am begining to think that I have a personality that will (in the long run) end up alone because I will never settle.. It could have something to do with my past and a deep rooted feeling that relationships can never work out.. I don't conciously feel that way but I think maybe deep down that is why I keep ending up alone..  The other thing that was interesting was that in my past was the king of swords.. That is basically a whole lotta pain.. I think Gordon was a bit surprised at that card and it made me realise that a lot of people I have in my life at the moment have only nkown me for a few months, there is probably only about 4-5 people who have known me long enough\well enough to know a lot of my "story".. It's interesting to see how people see me now compared to what people would have seena few years ago (I am a COMPLETELY different person now..)  Anyway, I'm giong to stop this surreal blog before it goes any further.. Grr arrghh and stuff.
