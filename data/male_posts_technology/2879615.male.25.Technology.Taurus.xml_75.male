We got a call from Fresh warning that he would be bringing "Frank and Luanne". LUANNE?! Who the hell is that? Now, me and la and yast are not ABOUT to have any more bitches in the Wing so we are not happy.  10 minutes later, there's a knock at the door. Me and La race around turning off lights and dancing around each other while Yast watches us completely baffled.  I'm going to run upstairs to hide when La trips and falls and starts howling "Man Down! I repeat MAAAANNN DOOOWWWN!!!" SOB yast lets in Fresh Frank (Uncle Craig) and Luanne (Adge).  Anyway, OTB sucks but I'm making paper. This was the lamest blog ever.   Fuck sobriety. We roll deep killa.  Luke, where are you?  Here's a big fuck you to philly cops trying to arrest me for being drunk four stories in the air.  Didn't I used to be cool? Didn't we all used to be a little cooler?  And Autumnal new class...what's with the wheezes who come around now? veird.  hearts stars and giggles  ~stupid old smash
