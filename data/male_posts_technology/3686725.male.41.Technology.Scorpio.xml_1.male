In case you took a blow to the head and are only now coming out of a coma let me remind you that Ronald Reagan died earlier this month and the nation tacitly agreed to forget abou Iran-Contra, the bombing of the marine HQ (resulting in the death of over 243 US soldiers), and an historically massive tax increase because Granpa Ronnie was just such a swell guy.  Now whatever disagreement one might have with the man's politics, no one could deny the inspiring bond of love between the late president and his now widowed Nancy.  While ten years his junior, Mrs. Reagan is still getting along in years and is not as spry as she once was.  Still she was the picture of class during the funeral procedings and was treated with honor and respect...well, mostly.  According to an interview in the  New York Times Magazine  with the president and Nancy's son Ron Reagan, he reports:   "Cheney brought my mother up to the casket, so she could pay her respects. She is in her 80's, and she has glaucoma and has trouble seeing. There were steps, and he left her there. He just stood there, letting her flounder. I don't think he's a mindful human being. That's probably the nicest way I can put it."  Hard to believe such a big-hearted humanitarian would tell someone like Senator Leahy to go f--- himself, isn't it?  Especially when such words would get him into such trouble with his puppet, I mean his boss... "I will restore civility and respect to our national politics." -- George W. Bush (at an RNC Gala, August 26, 2000)  "I will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with civility, to pursue the public interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion, to call for responsibility and try to live it as well." -- George W. Bush (Inauguration speech, January 20, 2001)  During CNN's coverage of the 2000 GOP Convention, William Schneider, their senior political analyst, noted: "Cheney was picked because of his quality of authority, and maturity,  and most of all,  civility  . But having those qualities is one thing and being able to communicate them effectively to a national audience, that's something else."  Are you f---ing kidding me?!
