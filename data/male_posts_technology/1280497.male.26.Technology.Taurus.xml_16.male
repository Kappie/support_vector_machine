Most of the time I think I prefer the latter, but that's lately because I'm still getting my lungs back. I bought some shoes for a price that basically brings the  average  for the last pair and this pair to $50 or so. It hurts to have to pay for something that is really just you putting one foot in front of the other a little bit faster than when you're just walking around. Not much faster, in my case.  So I'm on a rest day. It's fitting that friday would allow me to chill for 24 hours before I've got to make the 10 miler tomorrow. Good thing my brother Rob and I will be running together. It makes a huge difference when I'm able to talk to somebody while my lungs pop. It is a rest day, though, and I've been soaking in the feeling of not moving too much when I didn't have to. The cumulative effect of running is much more pronounced for me than when I run far for one day. Blah blah blah.  Whenever I go to  urlLink www.blogger.com , I can't help but click on one of the recently updated blogs on the left side of the page. It's just fascinating to eavesdrop on what someone else is living at a given moment. I read one from a guy named Pete, who's into drugs, the Hollywood scene, and a bunch of other stuff, but is interesting and different. You can get to his page (warning: he swears and talks about sex and stuff, so don't bother if you don't want to see the F word) through  urlLink www.acidlogic.com .  I talked to Naney and Grandpa last night. Naney and Grandpa are my dad's parents, and the past two weeks I've been recording conversations with them. We talk about stuff that has happened in their lives, and what they remember. It's a free-flowing deal, and I try not to push too much of an agenda, but it's tough. It's tough not to put words in their mouths. It's tough to walk the right line between impersonal and intrusive in the questions I ask. It's something I've never done before, and to hear them talk about their lives is probably the most enjoyable thing I do on a weekly basis. It's a couple hours in a week, I get to sit on the floor at their house and listen to them tell me about Uncle Phil and about their parents, about whom I knew absolutely nothing before we started these conversations. And in exchange for what is really cool, I get something even cooler--a recorded conversation that Julie and I can play for our kids, that will make them want to know more about my parents, and that will draw us all closer to one another. The last sentence turned out very much on the sappy side, but unfortunately, I've got to put the truth out here. My grandparents are people with a huge wealth of experience, and I'm their grandson, sitting and trying to soak it all in. I want to add that I want to do all this before it's too late, but I think it's implied in the action that there's only a limited amount of time given to get this kind of thing done.   By the way, are you interested in this type of thing? If so, it's a matter of taking a cheap hand recorder, putting a tape in it, and then asking someone about stuff you want to know. Most everyone will talk, if you ask them about stuff that's happened in their lives. The few who won't want talk about themselves are usually going to do it anyway because it's a nice thing. Listen to me talk, the expert.
