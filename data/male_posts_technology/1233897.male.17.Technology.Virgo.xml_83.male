Now that I suddenly realized that my friend Steven has a blog ( urlLink see his blog ) up, it sorta' motivated me to make some changes to mine.  I'll work on a timeline of all the last several weeks, but it won't be up until at least Friday night.  I'm getting ready to go to my church's mid-week service, tonight at 7:00, and am looking forward to it.  Goody's wearing his new combat boots (lol).    Youth Group last night was fun.  I really like the series we're going though right now, concerning evangelism.  It’s an area that I’m really week in, and I am finding myself wishing we were going to spend more time on it.  I think Stages may finally not be using the building on Tuesday nights from now on, which means we (the youth group) will have the sanctuary to ourselves.  We had a really cool worship chapel today at school.  It's amazing the talent some of my classmates have.  Oh, speaking of school, I woke up at 7:20 today, and had to get to school 1hr and 25 mins late ;)  Well, g2g get ready for tonight. Adios All!~
