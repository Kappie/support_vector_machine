Yeah, i did my own enquiries tonight, i phoned numerous taxi services which had pretty crappy cars at high prices, and i phoned 7 limo companies, 4 of which were already fully booked for May 9th, the other 2 were veyr expensive, and one didn't answer the phone, Pah! But at least we r sorted with it!, and Jackie and NIcki, MY LIMO BUDDIES!!! How exciting! But yeah, I expect by May we will be too vbusy with revisio and stuff than to spend hours trapsing round lookming for dresses. I will get my dress asap, and do jewellery etc at a later date, i thinks! Ooooh, I'm so excited I cant think of nething else to sya, except tiiiiiiiiiiidles people!!
