If you're a congressman from Michigan, you've got to be a pretty salty dog with respect to how blue collar workers have fared during the current administration / past 50 years.  And yet, Rep. Dingell was able to take a ludicrous decision by the Council of Economic Advisers to class fast food jobs as manufacturing positions and turn it into a funny (but pointed) screed: I am sure the 163,000 factory workers who have lost their jobs in Michigan will find it heartening to know that a world of opportunity awaits them in high growth manufacturing careers like spatula operator, napkin restocking, and lunch tray removal. 
Plus, all references to defunct McDonaldland characters should be applauded when made by elected officials.
