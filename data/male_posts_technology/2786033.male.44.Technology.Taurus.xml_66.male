Young kid goes to buy a car, won't listen to Dad cause "she knows what she's doing."   2.  Comes back with some Korean sputterpup, and a dealer-financing package at 28-kajillion percent intrest.  "Don't worry dad, I'll just quit school and work extra at the Burger Dungeon."   3.  Dad pops cork, packs heat, and goes to visit dealer.   urlLink Hilarity ensues!
