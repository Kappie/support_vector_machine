It’s a whole different perspective on how we approach our day.  Either we wake to tackle our ‘to do’ list, get things done, guided by our morals and whatever clarity we may at the moment have (both rather lacking to the need, I might add).  Or we wake in the midst of a dangerous Story, as God’s intimate ally, following him into the unknown. If you are not pursuing a dangerous quest with your life, well then you don’t need a Guide.  If you haven’t found yourself in the midst of a ferocious war, then you won’t need a seasoned Captain.  But if you intend to live in the Story that God is telling, and if you want the life he offers, then you are going to need more than a handful of principles, however noble they may be. - A personal walk with God comes to us through wisdom and revelation.  You will soon discover that we need both. - Wisdom is crucial.  But it is not enough.  Many well-meaning evangelicals rely on it exclusively.  That is why their lives remain where they are – rather short of all Christ promised. - We begin by assuming that God is still speaking. John 16:12-13 John 8:47 John 10:2-4,11 Many good people never hear God speak to them personally for the simple fact that they’ve never been told that he does.  But he does – generously, intimately. Now it doesn’t happen in an instant.  Walking with God is a way of life.  It’s something to be learned; our ability to hear God’s voice and discern his word to us grows over time.  We have an eye out for his particular word to us, and we learn as we go along. Notice that we must ask.  And we will sometimes struggle to hear and struggle with what we hear.  But personally, it’s worth it.  I’m after the path of life – and he alone knows it.  I've tried this of late, sort of.  I started recently just asking God about some stuff and trying to hone in on specific thoughts that would come in after this.  A few of them came in: - Saturday night I had this name just pop into my head, the last name of some friends from GCC.  They have daughters the same age as ours and go to our school too.  Anyway, turns out, he was in the hospital all weekend. - Felt the moving of a name and a specific topic of conversation I could bring up with someone at work - AR.  Brought it up today, he was overwhelemingly receptive to it, in fact, felt like he could use some advice about the topic and wanted to follow up at a later date.   Hmmm.  Wow...  Things like the above, and the story with CW, make me feel like I am making more of an impact than ever, in all facets of life.  It's cool.  Not only making an impact, but that God is really impacting my life of late, in terms of growth, development, ministry, etc.  It's really very cool.  Wow.
