I showed up last night with Jerry and we had a good time checking out all the sh*t and saw some fun stuff like Blanchards car. I then proceeded to head into the "fashion show" and cheeked out a runway of girls that seemed to have a strong desire to be somebody, but they were actually pretty nice. Steve Vanoni put on the show (http://www.horsecow.com) which was pretty fun, but I seemed to have a little too much fun (too much booze). SLA played @ 12:00 which was a fun show, but they sure seemed to argue quite a bit. Anyway the show was good fun and I seemed to make it home before sun up.  Coming up next: Pinball-A-Go-Go
