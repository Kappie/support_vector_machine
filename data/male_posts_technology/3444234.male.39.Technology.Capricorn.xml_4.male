Jo had the nuchal scan of  Bun  on Tuesday, I was presenting to a class but waiting nervously for an SMS on my mobile phone. Anyway, it was good news .. easiest thing is to give her report:   Whew!  I was a little worked up of course and then they called to tell me they were running about an hour behind schedule.  When I got there, I still had to wait another 20 minutes.  There were three other ladies waiting each  with their husband so I felt very lonely hehe.  Then another woman walked in and I thought "beaut, I'm not the only abandoned one here" .. but then she called her hubby and said he had 15 minutes to get there.  Oh well, you'll  just have to be there for the next visit!  The good news is, I have a video tape of the ultrasound .. which is just as well because the three printouts I have are really hard to work out.   Although it will still be difficult to understand what you're looking at on the video without the operator saying here's this or that.  And the really cool thing was being able to look at Bun in 3D!!  Bun was lying in a perfect position for the nuchal translucency scan so Theresa got that measurement first.  Then she went scooting around looking at Bun's heart (fluttering away very obviously), stomach and bladder (I took her word for those two!).  She also showed me Bun's legs and arms so he/she got full marks for having everything where it should be!  Bun's arms were covering the face for a lot of the time (shy already) but near the end he/she had a wriggle around and it looked way cool.  Apparently Bun is lying anterior (towards the front) so we won't feel any movements for quite some time - probably not til around 20 weeks whereas a posterior baby can be felt from about 17 weeks.  I'll read up on this though.  Anyway, then I went off and emptied my bladder (ahh) and Theresa prepared the results.  She called me into an office soon after and straight away said they were excellent results.  She sat me down with a flowchart of options.   Just walking in without any tests, my chances of having a Down's Syndrome baby were 1 in 139.  That's based primarily on my age.  Then the baby's age, my blood test results and the nuchal scan get taken into account and I had a nearly tenfold reduction in risk (1 in 1,385).  A perfect score for me would have been 1 in 1,390 but Theresa said she's never seen a perfect score so my result is pretty awesome.  We went through the flowchart which I'll have to show you rather than try to explain.  However, I'm booked in for an amnio on Wed 7 July at 9.30am (groan) so that we can check all the other chromosomal combinations (as well as find out if Bun is a he or a she!).  Of course, we can skip the amnio altogether but we'd already agreed to have it so the excellent result today  probably doesn't change that decision.  I loved your text message!  I smiled all the way back to the office.  xxxxx   So  woohoo!  is all I can say to that - go Jo and Bun! hehe.
