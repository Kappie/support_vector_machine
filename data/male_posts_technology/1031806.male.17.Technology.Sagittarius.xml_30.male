She’s back late Wednesday night, so I hopefully can see her again soon (it’s been like 2.5 weeks since I’ve seen her).  Last night I was up pretty late talking to a girl on the phone that has a lot of crap going on in her life and was going to use the wrong way out. It was kinda creepy cause I could hear the pill bottles and stuff as she tried opening them. In the end she was going to call a help center and see a counselor, I’m going to call later today and check up on how that went… man, guys don’t realize how much they can ruin a girl’s life… and truly ruin it. This girl wasn’t heartbroken by a guy (well, plural), but yeah… worse. Guys can be pigs.  Yesterday what else…. Oh yeah! So on Saturday this person sent me an email saying “I have interesting pictures of your beautiful girlfriend and one of her guy friends. Wanna see?”, that was kinda odd, so I said yes. Sure enough Sunday they sent me links to some pictures Jeannette took of Sarah hanging out with some of her friends. One was in the pool and her friend was being goofy, and the other was a group picture where she was “standing so close to him”, I guess those were supposed to get me upset but yeah, it didn’t work. I still have no idea who the person that emailed me was though, very interesting…  Today is yet another Monday. I like Mondays right now, other than the fact that I’m always tired. They really aren’t so bad, I mean think about it… it’s a Monday, but if work started on Tuesdays then everyone would hate Tuesdays, so I don’t see the problem. Today my boss is going to be there for a little bit (maybe), and then I’m on my own for the week. I hope nothing drastically blows up (hmm… yes I do hope this).  Woo, more computer parts should be coming today! Unless FedEx is stupid. Which they may be, you never know.
