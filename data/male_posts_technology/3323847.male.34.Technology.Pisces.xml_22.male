This is the site maintained by those who  create  this show, not Comedy Central.  As such, it tends to be, well, South Park-ish: Up-front, in your face and brutally honest.  Funny as this may sound, I personally find South Park to be one of the most intellectually stimulating shows on the air today (Next to "Dennis Miller" and "The Daily Show").  That's quite an accomplishment considering they do this by using dick and fart jokes. ;)  Serously, though, these folks are absolute masters of subtlety and subtext.  I didn't realize this until I actually  thought  about the message that was being delivered.  Once I realized that, I finally understood that they really weren't being that subtle - they were throwing this information into my face.  I just wasn't seeing it because I was enjoying the dick and fart jokes too much.
