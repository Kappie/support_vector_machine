So, I'm starting this blog thing on a bad note - my goddamm sunovabitch 10 year old Audi is gettin some serious service -Engine is leaking oil through the cylinder heads. Head gaskets are also showing drip. Exhaust is completely shot from the second cat back and the rear left CV joint has broken seal - and i just went in to get an electrical problem / muffler fixed...WTF? The wallet is going to be taking a major hit - Can you f*ing believe over 4Gs!!!! Couldn't sleep last night thinking about how insane this bill is going to be. Arrgh...I better get another 100,000 miles from this car or i will be pissed...  Please sir, may i have another? (bending over and grabbing ankles...)  Music: Mos Def - Miss Fat Booty
