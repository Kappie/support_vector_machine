After graduating last May, I thought it would be fun to get a low responsibility job so I could do some traveling because I had sisters in 3 different locations across the world at the time. I also wasn't quite ready for the whole 'career' thing at 22 years old. Therefore, when I moved back to Colorado Springs (SPGS) after graduation, I got a job as a server at PFs. It was fun and did allow me to be flexible with my time and travel. The big trip I took was to Panama to see my sister Patricia. (That was a great time, maybe I will post on it later.) Anywho, I got tired of waiting tables. I think I felt like I should be doing so much more.  So, without any other plans, I quit my job and now am looking to do something with my degree: B.A. in Computer Information Systems.  Ciao
