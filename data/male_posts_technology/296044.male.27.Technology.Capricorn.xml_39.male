I cleaned my part, and Jeremy, amazingly, cleaned his. He  even followed through on his promise to clean the carpets. Hmm... guess he  really wanted that deposit back? Enough that he took some  initiative.          If you haven't already received my email, check out  my improved website,  http://home.columbus.rr.com/grandmasterj           It's astounding. No, it's not, but I felt  like saying that.          Let's see, what else is new... nothing. How  was my fourth you ask?I went to Ed  Amy's for a graduation  party for Ed, and a sorta 4th of July party. That was a good time. Saw  some peeps I haven't seen in a while, and the best part of all: Josh blew  stuff up! But if anyone asks, no, he didn't.          Aight. Time for me to go. One last  thing, remember:          IT ALL GOES DOWN AT THE TEA HOUSE.          Night kiddos.
