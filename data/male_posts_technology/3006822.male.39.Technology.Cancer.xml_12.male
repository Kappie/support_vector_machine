Not only do they keep wine from developing infections, they also keep the wine from oxidizing. If you are concerned about the use of sulfites in wine read on!   Sulfite actually occurs naturally in small amounts during fermentation. Sulfites are your friend. Not only do they keep wine from developing infections like fiIm yeast, mould, and acetobacter (vinegar bacteria), they also keep the wine from oxidizing. Without the use of sulfites most wine would have to be consumed literally within months of production without it going to vinegar wor worse.  Many people worry that they may be allergic to sulfites. True sulfite allergies are very rare. It's more likely that they have been exposed to a high level of sulfites in the past. In the 1970's restaurants would douse their salad bars with 2000 PPM (part per million) sulfite solutions in order to keep the produce fresh. Mixing this with acidic foods, such as salad dressings or vinegar, would cause the salad to release clouds of sulfite gas, provoking unpleasant reactions.    What most people describe as a sulfite headache is a reaction to bio-amines. These are compounds formed in wines for various reasons, one of the commonest being malolactic fermentation in the presence of sugar. Some commercial wineries start malolactic inoculation before the end of alcohol fermentation, guaranteeing the formation of bio- amines. So the first thing to do is to attempt to find wines that have not undergone MLF, and then determine whether the headache occurs or not.  Although I do not have a comprehensive list of wines that don't undergo MLF, checking out the producers web site is a good idea (look under wine making notes).  Many inexpensive wines do not undergo MLF therefore some claim that "cheap" wines don't bother them.  Go figure!  Potassium Metabisulfite is a stable source of sulfite in winemaking. The use of sulfur compounds is not a recent innovation. The Dutch shipping companies popularized the use of sulfur in the 16th century by refusing to ship any wines not treated. They insisted on the use of sulfites because the treated wines were the only ones that survived a long sea voyage without spoiling.   Sulfites work by releasing free sulfur dioxide, which inhibits yeast, mould and bacteria. It does this in two ways: one, it kills some of the organisms outright, and two, it blocks the surviving organisms ability to reproduce.  Some wine makers claim to not add sulfites, which means that much more time has to be spent cleaning the equipment and ensuring that no stray yeasts, molds or bacteria are present.    Sulfites are also added directly to wine after fermentation, to help prevent oxidation. Oxidation in wine follows the same pattern that you see in the cut edge of an apple-the wine turns brown and takes on a flat 'cardboard' taste. Sulfur binds with the oxygen in the wine and prevents this damage.     Some facts that might clear up any misunderstanding about sulfites:     Sulfites are a recognized food additive. The federal government controls their use. .All commercially available wines contain sulfites, even those labeled 'Kosher' or 'Organic'.     Nearly all dried fruits and meats contain sulfites. Raisins, for instance, have up to 250 PPM. Frozen orange juice, bacon, dried noodles, all contain sulfite.     All grape-based wines produce sulfites naturally during fermentation, up to a level of about 1O PPM. Even with no addition of sulfites, wines will still contain them.    This is not to say that sulfites are totally benign. People with asthma or emphysema should avoid inhaling sulfite powder or the gas that comes off the prepared solution. It can act as a bronchial constrictor, aggravating any breathing problems. Also , adding extra sulfites to wine is of no benefit, as it can spoi I the flavor, giving it a 'burnt match', smell.    A final, but very interesting consideration is that if a wine maker insists not using sulfite additives, they must also leave out the sorbate. Sulfite suppresses malolactic bacteria, but sorbate does not. Without any sulfite to prevent malolactic fermentation, the bacteria will convert the sorbate into hexadienol, producing a stupendously horrible aroma of composting geraniums and rotting trout.  I know, it is more than you wanted to know and we are by no means M.D.'s here at Vinterus.  Any potential allergic reaction should be closely monitored with your physician.  As noted earlier, our consulting allergist tells us that most people who claim to have sulfite allergies do not test as such.  The simple test is the raisin test:  eat some raisons and if you get a headache, you have a sulfite allergy.    There are methods to eliminate sulfites are the point of consumption, a subject that I will take up in a later post.  Cheers!
