Just tell me how much of education you learn in your high school, you really use in your daily life (after an age of 24-25). Why go that far. How many of us think that we made an informed decision after our school as to which professional stream we must take up? How can we take that informed decision if we are not capable of making that decision.  Honestly, I feel we are better off going back to our good old 'Gurukul' way of imparting education. These days the schools, colleges (atleast a huge majority of them) are there only to ensure that the children get good marks (no to mention about the publicity and other stuff) !! Yeah right, tennis also is just about hitting the ball onto the other side of the court. Wish it were so simple.  Somebody reading this having some ideas.. do drop in a line. I myself have this dream of opening a gurukul school and try and get the best of the educationists under one roof. Am not sure if I am capable of doing it or not.. I even don't know if I have the resources to do so. But someone who is capable and has the resources should do it  Cheers !!
