       And so I begin again.   This isn't my first attempt at keeping a journal, nor my first attempt at keeping a web log. Something always seems to come up, distract me, pull my attention away from diligently logging entries. This time I don't expect that to happen.    This time my situation is very different. This time I'm older, maybe wiser. I have a different life. I have a different job. I seem to even have a different body, but we'll get to that.    I suppose there are an equal number of reasons for and against starting a journal now. In a short 3 days I start my first "after-college" job, or maybe career. My life goes back into a steady daily routine which, contrary to popular thought, will be jarring. Although the hours are regular, I'm sure that the first few weeks of work will not be. Orientations, meetings, group lunch outings, paperwork. I find myself wondering how long it will be before I begin to personalize my desk.    With the new job comes a new income, a new car, new apartment. It is going to be hectic. When will I find time to post into this journal? Possibly not every day, but frequently enough I think. And still, these things aren't the worst of my concerns.    Last year, from June to July of 2003, I lived in Japan. The experience was amazing, I loved every minute of it. I brought some great souvenirs home. I brought home something unexpected as well.   Since a few minutes before my plain landed back on US soil, I've been very ill.  My digestive system is not working properly at all. It is not generally very painful, although it can be.  Most of the time I simply feel nauseous after eating.  Because of this I don't eat very much or very often anymore, hence the new body.   When I started thinking about this journal, I had thought about not writing anything regarding my illness. It is said that a gentleman never discusses his ailments. I considered it for a long while, and I decided that this journal wouldn't be honest if I was constantly trying to avoid a topic that affects me daily. I'll try to complain as little as possible.    So really, what is this for?   This journal is mainly for my friends and family. I'm expecting that the people who come here to read my journal already know me. I can imagine a stranger stumbling across these pages from time to time, but I wonder if any one of these would return on purpose. Conversely, I like to imagine my friends and family returning often to catch up on my life.  It seems that many of my friends and family have moved a good distance away.  I don't see them all as much as I would like, but I hope that they will find the time to read this journal on occasion and maybe post a comment or two.  The internet is a powerful tool, and I hope I can use it to stay connected to the people that I miss. This journal may even help keep me connected to myself, particularly during this turbulent period of my life.    What can you expect?  that's a fair question. I guess it will depend on the day. I may write something interesting, funny, depressing, uplifting, upsetting, or simply a paragraph or two to steal a few precious minutes of your day.   There.  Reading this dull introduction post took a significant portion of your life time that you can never get back. Don't think it was wasted though.  I'm keeping them all in a jar.  In a few months I'm going to take that jar to Chuck E. Cheese and trade it in for that cool bicycle helmet.
