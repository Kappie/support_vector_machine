Plus I can finally tell Hotmail that they can take their 2 megabytes of storage and cram neatly up their collective asses.  The following is my vision of the Hotmail conception meeting.    Ass Sucking Yes Man 1:  Hey Billy Gates we're a bunch cheap, money-grubbing whores who enjoy bending consumers over rails and dry fucking them until blood pours from their ears, aren't we?  Billy Gates:  Um I do enjoy the ass fucking of the consumers.  Why have we thought of any new ways to financially violate the population at large?  Ass Sucking Yes Man 1.2:  Well me and Ass Sucking Yes Man 1 through 1.6 were snorting cocaine off the thighs of transexual Thai hookers when it hits us.  We sucker people in with a "free" email account, but we only give them 2mb of storage space, then charge them if they want more.(insane laughter followed by sounds of heavy petting)  Billy Gates: Ass Sucking Yes Man 1 through 1.6 you treat yourselves to the employee 401(k) fund for a week you've earned it.(High five all around the room then have Steve Ballmer pump up the troops with his patented screech of doom.   urlLink Watch video .)  I have no issues with Microsoft products themselves, but I do not enjoy paying out the ass for software only to receive a buggy product and tech support from people who obviously hate anyone who consumes their oxygen.  Then top it all of by listening to people scream that the money goes to R of new, better products.  Fuck you and the R horse you rode in on, they spend more on advertising and making a pretty box to package things in then on R  Large corporations while providing some nice and convenient things are sucking the life out of our country and all our elected officials do is hold out their slime palms and ask for more money.
