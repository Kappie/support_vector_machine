Ms. Wiley starts her summer job this week and seems excited.  I can't wait until she comes back to town and gets movie night started.   Jeff emailed and IMed me today.  he seems a little bored in Minnesota.  Cannot blame him.    Speaking of movies, I watched Rushmore with Tom tonight.  It is a decent movie.  Still weirds me out a little.  It reminds me of Ann because she listened to the soundtrack most of the last year.  At first I thought it was odd that all these songs Ann liked were on the movie, but then I remembered that after we watched it together she burned the soundtrack cd.  Reds won.  yep...bout out of things to talk about...going to bed now
