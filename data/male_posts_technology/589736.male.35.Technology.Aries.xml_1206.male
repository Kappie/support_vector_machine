While many of the articles/comics in the links you post piss me off to no end, I accept them as reflective of your views and not you trying to tell me how to act or think.  You don't necessarily share our passion (to strong a word but I can't think of a better one) for Buffy.  That is fine.  I don't get most of the song lyrics that are ocassionally posted here and have actually stopped reading them.  I don't complain about them being here, I just don't participate in the discussion about them.  While this group is small, it is diverse.  We all have things we like and don't like, things we will agree on and things we won't.  I like discussing things with other people, as I assume we all do or we wouldn't be posting here.  Please, let's not place restrictions on what we discuss.    I am not angry with you about your post, but it did pluck something.  I think JLS was correct in that if this discussion had been about B5, you would have been involved, but someone else who did not share your passion for it might not.
