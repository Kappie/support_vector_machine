He seemed like a nice enough bloke and I totally failed to detect any hint of ex-policeman about him.  He recorded everything I said whilst filling in part of the insurance claim. I went to quite some length to emphasize how keen I was to have Archibalds, the main Subaru dealer, do any mechanical work on the vehicle. He said that he would pass this onto the insurance assessor for me. I doubt that they can object, Archibalds have done all mechanical work on the car since I came to Christchurch.  He hadn't been able to look at my car yet bust said he would do so soon.
