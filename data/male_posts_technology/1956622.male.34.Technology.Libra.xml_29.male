It did not help that she needed to go potty in the middle of the call but she took the phone with her to the potty to finish talking.  She ended up hanging up and grandma and I talked.  I had to tear down her swing I felt bad about it but the wood was rotting and it was becoming unsafe so it is the safe thing to do.  I had a line on an above ground pool but that fell through and I was telling my mom about it.  She says she may be able to get one for Karissa for her B-day.  Karissa loves the water and I can get an 18ft pool for $348 so I may put that where the swing set was.    Karissa loves the pool
