The Boyz of Simply United...Me, Wai Nyan and Jamie and of Course God, The Father and the Holy Spirit had a nite out yesterday just having dinner and really had a good discussion on controversial topics or someone say taboo subjects. We hanged out in Damansara Utama , havin Steven Western Food Corner where one of the best chicken chop around.  Indeed God is in the midst of us, as we catch up on each other's lives..talks about our blog and it was good. In one of the discussion wai nyan talked about the ppl in his college and there was this girl that Erin introduced to him that was also from ATC Kemanyan , was attending Hope of God KL...which is my old church and yet another guy,,..that Wai Nyan met who he highly regarded as big taiko. JOnathan Chua was his name and he attends Hope of God KL too.  That name strucks back memories and struck a chord in my heart. One of my heart desire since i left Hope Nilai and went to KL for studies in Help Institute would be able to meet up with everyone from Hope church hoping to encourage them and get to know how they are.   Jonathan Chua is currently Wai Nyan's taiko, one of the nicest guy that Wai Nyan met up with , when he entered into this college. Jonathan Chua to me is Ps Jonathan Chua, cause he used to be my pastor in Hope Serdang, one of the most influencial man God have placed him into my life to build strong foundations and attitudes towards God . Ps Jonathan is actually my grand sheperd along with sheep mate is Keith Tay Wen Chang, another sheep who have rub off the annointing that Jonathan Chua have, currently serving in City Harvest Outreach Malaysia with Ps Kevin Loo. Keith Tay founded the church with Ps Kevin Loo , which church grew to about 200 over people in less than 2 years time.  Jonathan Chua, if u reading this blog...i truly Praise God that God have decided the time for us to meet again. I just want to praise God for you...for all that happens. To let u know that I am now serving in the  COUZ (College United Zone) in SIBKL for almost 3 years. The foundations and attitude is built strongly upon your teachings and the attitudes shown by God thru you all this time.  Indeed God is in Control and God Unites ...everyone I have met seems to hold a missing link to meet someone i knew and I believe God 's awesome power and might. Truly He is God over all our lives.  This year church 's theme is Influencing The Nation and it comes from the vision statement of the church Inspired By God, Influencing Nations , Impacting Generations.  and even in this posting I have touched on Influencing the Nations,....and on a more personal level, who have influenced you in your lives,...Who have God have planned and sent that person to influence you to who you are...it can be your pastor, your mentor, your dad...it also can mean a lot of people.  But whoever it is , start to thank them and if u have hurts or unforgiveness...let it go ... Ask God for the influencing factor so that you can be the person that God will sent to influence to your frens and family.  Connect , Relate , Resonate The Faith of Jesus Christ.
