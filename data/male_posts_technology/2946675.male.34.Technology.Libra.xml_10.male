I really want a home;a family; but that's all been done and may not come my way again. I really want stability; taking a leap of faith isn't very stable  This could turn into a perception chronicle.   I've been offered the Direct TV job in Boise ... (that's four hours away from here) and i've been accepted to BSU and financial aid is willing to pay for me to attend. Sounds like a good opportunity. Why am I so god damn scared.
