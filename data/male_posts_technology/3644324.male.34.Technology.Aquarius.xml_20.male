The lady that runs the guest house had heard of it (it's like a mile from her place) but didn't know exactly how to get there, but the lady that cooks and cleans gave me good directions. The castle was very cool - there were only about 10 other people there (15 year old Canadian boy from Sarnia who wanted to tell me about how her mom used to work with Bertuzzi's mom and yada, yada. Then his aunt decided to repeat their Bertuzzi connection. I should have know better than to wear the Canuck shirt). Back to the castle. It was really cool, an abandoned "real" castle that you could wander all through, it had real fortifications and living quarters and kitchens - I was bedazzled - it was also somewhat fallen apart - it was multi-floored but in most places the roofs and floors were gone. The steward there suggested a nice walk back to the city - a nice 3 mile walk but it was lovely.   Then I headed back to the Royal Scottish Museum - yesterday I went through the history of Scotland and today I went through the general section which I'm guessing would have bored the living crap out of you. I spent 3 hours going through the history of life evolving on earth, the minerals on earth and especially in Scotland, a whole lot of stuffed animals, some dinosaur bones, a big section of Egyptian artifacts (how does every museum on earth have these? Are there any left in Egypt?)   Then I walked 2 miles across town to building #1 of the Scottish National Gallery. It blew, only this one crappy artists work. Then I went across the street to Building #2, it had some great stuff - a selection of Edvard Munch work that I was really taken by. He has never been my cup of tea before but I think I'll look up more of his stuff when I get home - maybe it's my Norwegianity showing...   Then I walked 1.5 miles back across town to building #3 and saw the really good stuff - some nice Impressionist stuff and even a few cool Scottish bits. Looking back I can't believe how lucky those Musee D'Orsee and Louvre folks are to have so many fantastic paintings.   I saw building #4 yesterday, total crap, and unfortunately 7pm has passed so I won't be making it to building #5. Oh well, I took in enough culture today.   Yesterday I decided that Edinburgh was too nice not to spend a 3rd day but not quite nice enough fora 4th so I booked a bus ticket to Inverness (Loch Ness and bottlenose dolphins and Highlands) online last evening - 6£. If you book it at the station it costs 18£. What a ridiculous system where you get 33% off like that... Then today while I was taking a rest at the Museum it occured to me that it would be an excellent idea to phone ahead and reserve a place to sleep in Inverness, since I had a phone and a book with phone numbers. I called and managed to get a really cheap (but reputedly excellent) b on my first try. Magic!   Now I'm back at the computer and I'm fricken exhausted again. But good exhausted. In a couple of minutes I have to go outside and take a picture of the castle with the sun setting light. Sun doesn't really go down until around 10 here but the "good light" shows up around 8 or so.   What else? Not much. I have discovered (or rather verified) that travelling alone is good because you can see all the stuff that only you want to see and you don't bore the crap out of anyone else and they don't bore the crap out of you. BUT...travelling on your own isn't as much fun as travelling with someone else. Talking to museum security guards just isn't as much fun as talking to you. And, I may be the only person travelling by myself in the whole city. Everywhere I've been there are couples strolling hand-in-hand or families with rambunction kids and I keep thinking that it would be more fun if I had a rambunctuous kid and someone to hold my hand...   I'll email again after I get to Inverness (if they have the Internet that far north) and let you know how the 4 hour bus trip goes. I'll have a chance to catch up on my writing - yes I've managed to sneak in the odd hour of writing here and there amongst my activities, mostly during meals. I ate at a pub last night - The World's End - fish and chips and two glasses of great ale. Then I headed out to walk and discovered that dehydration and not much food and alcohol make for a light-headed walk. I'm fine and the guy I accidentally bumped into will recover eventually.
