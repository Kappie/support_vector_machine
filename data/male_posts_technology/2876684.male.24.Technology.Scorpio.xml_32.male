It was a good show don't get me wrong, but I suppose my expectations of what I was going to see were much higher - after all, the feats of the Shaolin Monks are nothing less than legendary.   I guess what I consider legendary has changed somewhat in the past year.  The fighting tonight was obviously staged and for someone who actually does fight for real it just looked uninteresting... I did appreciate the subtleties of the performance that a lot of people probably didn't pick up on though. I'd go into more detail but I shouldn't spoil for it other people.  Go see it people you won't regret it... and keep your eyes on the young ones - they absolutely rock! :)
