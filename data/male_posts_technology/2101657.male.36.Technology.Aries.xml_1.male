I'm back in college through the tuition re-emburstment program at work, and have decided to finish my degree. What better way to do it then to start off with a language, right?  The classes are 2 nights a week, 2hrs long, and they go for 2months at a time.  It's called a TimeSavers program.  Not sure who it's saving time for, doesnt seem to be me.  Between work, school, and Scouts, doesn't seem like alot of time left.     Today's been a sort of recovery day for me, woke up in the middle of the night with a migraine.  I get one ever 2-3 weeks it seems.  Often enough that I take medication to help prevent them and medication for once I do get one.  No clue why I get them, I've suffered from them since I was 5yrs old.    Went out and put in a couple holes in our local Frisbee golf course.  I had a argument with the wife, and I needed to get out of the house and away from her.  The course isn't the place to go when mad though.  There are a few er.... really steep areas, and it doesn't work to go trumping up them in a huff.. only makes you more tired.  Decided to do a couple of the holes on the back 9, and on the way back, I climbed down into the revene, and took it most of the way back up to the front of the course, keeping my eyes peeled for any discs laying around.  That's how I found the Frisbee golf disk I have now (www.discraft.com). It's different from playing with a Whamo(C) brand Frisbee. Back then I played with the big white 151gram disk.  Lots of hang time with those old ones. The discs you use now are the size of a large saucer/small dinner plate, and man, do they throw totally different.   I used to play Disc Golf alot when I was a teen...it's awesome to be playing it again.  My oldest is getting into it and wants his own Golf Disc now too. Already told him thats something I'd happily take for Christmas  .   Still working on getting over this cold, had it going on 3-4 weeks now and I sure to look forward to not coughing all the time, and always feeling very run-down.  Ever dread getting up in the morning because your exhausted? Thats how I've felt the last 3 weeks.  I REALLY look forward to this cold being gone.  Almost as much as being done with Spanish 101 tomorrow night  .  Star Trek:Enterpries was decent Saturday.  Hoshi, the communications officer is telepathically contacted by a funky looking huminoid with feelers or something on his head.  He can easily read Hoshi's mind, and at the end, tries to trick her into staying. He just makes a few blaring faults that she catches, and returns to her ship. He's able to hold an ojbect and get mental impressions left on it by whomever build it/last touched it or something, and is able to help send Capt Archer in the right direction, to find a colony of Xindi who are building part of a weapon to destroy the earth.  Looks to be quite the story arc, which is a nice change for Trek.  I loved how DS9 did it all the time, and it's nice to see ST:Enterprise doing the same thing :-)
