It always gives me warm'n'fuzzies when guys like Sridhar Iyengar and Jishnu Mukerji say what I've been thinking because, underneath all the political games, they're actually pretty clued in. In this case it was about the scale of applicability of Executable UML, and the positioning more generally of UML within MDA. (This is tied to posts that I've made in the past, such as  urlLink this one .) I expect replies from Steve Mellor and other xUML people within a few days.  A very small point, though: Sridhar should be careful about plugging projects like  urlLink GMT . As far as I can tell, its all but still-born, and saying that it represents a significant push within the Eclipse community for Model Transformations is, IMHO, not really a fair representation of reality. Of course, this isn't to say that there aren't  urlLink kickass  model transformation engines that use Eclipse and EMF! ;-)  Disclaimers:    Apologies to non-OMG people, who have no idea what/who I'm talking about, but the koolaid is really good!   The last statement, the "kickass" one, is biased in the extreme.
