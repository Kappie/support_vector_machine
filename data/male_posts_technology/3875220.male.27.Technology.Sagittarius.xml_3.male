I've been doing this for about a month now, and today wondered if they finally posted a job opening for the job I'm leaving.  After a bit of poking around, I finally found the job posting on my company's website. So, me being me, I get this idea in my head to apply for it. Figure I'd get a small chuckle out of it at the very least. Would be funny to have someone from HR call me up and ask me if I would consider coming in for an interview and then start going off on her. Childish? Yes. But I can be like that sometimes.  Not much else going on though, but it's still early. Was supposed to go to this bar last night with friends from work, but didn't. The place is a meat market at it's worst. Everyone is gauging everyone else, running in their minds what the beer rating for everyone is. Or how many beers it would take to get them drunk enough to take advantage of easily. And people say  I'm  an evil fuck. What is this world coming to?
