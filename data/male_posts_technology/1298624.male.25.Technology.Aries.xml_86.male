Why do people, who cannot speak english to save their life, get hired by predominantly english speaking businesses? Isn't the english language pretty much a requirement in America today? I'd like to think so. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to put anyone down and I'm not being racist against anyone who doesn't speak english. If I were going to Japan to work in a business setting, I would attempt to learn their language and writing system in order to communicate better in my work/home environment.   The second question I have is not directed towards the people who cannot speak english or speak it bad, but to the corporations who hire these people based on skillsets that JUST pertain to the job. Hey Corporate America, don't you think that speaking english CLEARLY and PROPERLY is pretty much a requirement in today's business setting? Not only a requirement, but a goddamn necessity?! We live in a country that is dominated by a specific language. It happens to be english (or whatever bastard dialec of english you speak). Just as I said earlier, if I went to Japan, China, Spain, India, France...I would work hard to make myself easily understandable to others. I think it is a courtesy that should be observed.   Now, I'm not trying to come down on those that are currently learning english, working hard at it, and pulling down a job at the same time. Consequently, I think that is admirable and I do not include such people [in my rant] who take the time (if they can) to learn a bit about the place they reside in and, at the very least, try to conform to standards of communication to make themselves representable.   I am, however, knocking those people who come from different countries (which I have absolutely NO problem with, mind you) and make no effort to properly observe and/or study the language at which is dominant in this country. That, out of many things, pisses me off the most. People that come here and do not speak english, do not make a concerted effort to learn the language in order to properly communicate, and basically live their lives here in complete and utter ignorance of custom.  I know that last part may have came off as racist and/or elitist. I get pissed because people from different countries want to come here and study very hard to learn english as a second language. I can name a LOT of people that are born in different countries and come here, learn the language, and communicate as if they were born here! That is something commendable...as it should be when one of us goes to another country (I would think to stay permanently) and attempt to study that country's customs and language.   I'm sure what I am ranting about is definitely in the minority. Nobody really cares about this as long as a person who cannot speak english can get his/her point across...be it sign language, drawing something, or pointing. I just can't get over the fact that businesses hire people like this. Shit, there are certifications for Microsoft products and most IT departments REQUIRE that you have this or they won't even give you a chance of an interview. Doesn't anybody think this should be the same for language skills as well?!
