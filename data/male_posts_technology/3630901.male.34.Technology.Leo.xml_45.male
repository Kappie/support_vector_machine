I feel like I should talk to another lawyer, because I feel like L and I come to an informal agreement, and then the mediator throws in a wrench, changing everything.   I feel like I'm getting screwed.   Nothing is signed yet of course.  But now it looks like instead of a 50/50 split, it will be a 55/45 split, with L getting 7 years of alimony.  And I'll be paying all of day care.  Just the day care alone means that it's unlikely I'll be able to keep the house.  L was saying all she really wants is for me to help her get the condo.  Did I already say that I feel like I'm getting screwed?  Now, the only good part of alimony is that it comes off my income and goes onto L's income.  hmmmmm...... yeah, that's about the only good part of it.  So now I'm back to thinking I'm going to have to move.  Except now I'm also thinking that I'll need to get a condo, not a house, because that's all I'll be able to afford.  Plus, do I really have the time or the inclination to do all the upkeep on the house?  I don't really know.  But I don't think so.  I mean on the nights that I have the kids, I'll want to be with the kids.  And the nights that I have free, I'll want to go out.  The other thought I had, though, was that I could keep the house and simply be paying out more than I'm taking in until the kids are out of day care - 1 year = 1 kid out, 2 years = 2 kids out.  Then I'm saving tremendously on day care costs.  I'll sell my Tercel.  I need to do a graph to figure out when I'd start breaking even, and how much savings I'd eat up in the 1st year and in the 2nd year.  Because if it's breaking even after one year, and then going back to the plus side in 2 years, maybe it's worth it to keep the house.  I also didn't realize that the 401k funds could be transferred, penalty-free to L via some legal proceeding.  That's good in that I could take a $22k of her end straight out of my retirement.  Then I cash out my stocks for another $23k ... I gotta do some more spreadsheets.  I just got a call from e-trade - heloc increase approved.
