But since I don't have that kinda money, I will settle for an experience much more realistic, transformation through Christ and Scripture! I was challenged by one of my friends with Romans 67 yesterday...He has been memorizing all 16 chapters of Romans...He shared those two chapters with me and they really hit home with my current struggles in this life..It talks about our flesh and how it is crucified with Christ in order that our body of sin might be done away with (Romans 6:6b) And through a story I read about Adam and Eve and their decision that changed the the world forever, I am forever changed...It talked about how in the beginning of Genesis all was well, no problems because their focus was on God and the constant stream of love, truth, and strength was because of their attention centered on Him. Until a serpent walked along ;) and started speaking to Eve. Here is the catch, she didn't just hear Satan, she had dialogue with him...Allowing Satan to distract her got her focus off of God and lead her astray...This is where the whole Romans 67 came in...Our mortal bodies, "earthsuits" are dead! We are no longer held captive or slaves to our flesh, we can no longer identify with it because we are new creations in Christ Jesus our Lord. Who was raised from the dead and death no longer has master over Him! So let me put this into more personal terms, my struggles that occur daily: lust, greed, covetousness, sexual impurity of the mind and body are real, but because I no longer identify with my flesh because I am in Christ, a new creation. I can only identify with Christ who has power over all the aforementioned...Another lesson learned from a woman!!!! Thank you Lord for women!!!! I just wish sometimes they would recognize that the way they present themselves can make a brother fall into sin!!
