Listen to me being all dramatic.  The roomate, Justin came back home last night.  His hair is longer and we went up to the local pub, Dana's, and he told us his stories from his grand trip to Gonzaga. He went to the emergency room again.  I think he tries to go to the emergency room in every city he visits.  Tonight we are going to see  urlLink The Roots  play.  It should be fun.  I was speaking to Lyle last night and evidently the St. Lunatics are the hottest things coming.  I downloaded an mp3 last night, but have yet to have a chance to listen.  I am sure it will be "kick'n".  Well that is all for now.  I will be back with my thoughts on the show tomorrow.
