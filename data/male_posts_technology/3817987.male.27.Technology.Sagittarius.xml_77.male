The organizing principle of the film, "If corporations are legal persons then what sort of people are they?", was kind of silly but the detail on how corporations work was fascinating stuff.  And even though the film takes a far left anti-capitalist stance it  least gives the other side a chance to say their peace.  You have to respect a film that features both Noam Chomsky and Milton Friedman.
