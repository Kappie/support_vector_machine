Alright, so I was bored last night playing RS3 when I created my own game and waited for the people on my friends list to go online when  urlLink this  chick started playing with me.  She's cool and all but she's only 16 and she lives in NY.  That might be a little too far for weekend driving besides the fact that she is jail bait material.  So in my search for girls in my area that play RS3 I have located 15 girls that play RS3 on XBOX live.  There are 15 girls who listed RS3 as their favorite game and 27 total girls in IL that play on XBOX live (that posted their pics on  urlLink the site .  Here's a few of the ones that look good.   urlLink GSPOTCHAOS  plays Ghost Recon: Island Thunder   urlLink JEN2U  plays Project Gotham Racing 2   urlLink LILBLONDIE11  plays Counter Strike   urlLink LONGDONGSILVER0  (I don't know if she's a real person but nice picture eh?   urlLink SASSY  plays MOTOGP   urlLink VIRTUALRACER  plays Midtown Madness  I guess that's about it for the chicks in IL.  I looked at MI and IA too but there really isn't much there.  I'm not saying that these chicks listed here are grade A but whatever I guess.  Wisconsin has some cute ones though.  like:  urlLink JV32 .  What a hottie little asian.  I guess she belongs to a gaming clan as well.  The  urlLink PMS Clan .  Hehe, I thought it really stood for the real PMS but apparently it stands for Psychotic Men Slayerz or something.  Whatever.  In Indiana there are a few as well like:  urlLink JEN N TONIC .  Clever I guess.   urlLink TIMIDDRAGONFLY  is kinda cute too!  RS3 was alright last night.  My gaming started out really slow.  I was getting killed left and right but gradually I finally was able to get going and start killing people.  Last night I also got my very first 5 kill round.  WAHOO!  hehe.  That was pretty cool but on average I would get 3 and then get killed.  Damn fuckers.  There goes my ELO.    Well that's it.  I should get back to work (HA!).  Alrighty
