One, a fanciful retelling of the Guy Fawkes story set in a postapocalyptic Britain, is  an adaptation of V for Vendetta, the graphic novel by Alan Moore and David Lloyd.  The other, Plastic Man, is based on the old DC Comics character. Plastic Man has long been rumored to be the Wachowskis' next film, but, of course, there's no official word."  read the full article  urlLink here .   oddly enough, Matrix 3 premieres on November 5 - Guy Fawkes Day.
