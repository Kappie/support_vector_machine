I had been too involved with the whirlwind of life without taking time to live it.      Recent news ...   My company landed the contract I have been working on for the past nine month. My grandparents have finished moving into their new house. One of the 'three amigos' from my past has come into town. He is moving to  urlLink Perth , but wanted to say his goodbye's to us. He has changed from going by Don, his given name, to his new nickname Dax. I have a high school reunion next month.(if anybody knows anyone up for a free meal to be my date, drop me a note) I just received a call from a coach to play in  urlLink WV's amateur soccer  league. I can't wait.  This is really, really funny.  urlLink http://jibjab.com/default.asp    I need to find a place other than Uno's to hang out.  If you guys have any suggestions, I'm all ears.
