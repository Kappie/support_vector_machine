Good times. :)  Dad hooked up a garbage disposal wich was acquired for free from my parent's neighbors and our family friends the Southers.  YAY!  This is a very powerful and very quiet model.  And dad's work was great (except the permanent purple spots on the floor  but meh.. it was free, and we can re-lanolium later anyway.)  He also helped install an outside vent for our dryer, and it looks very good.  It has occurred to me how luck I am to have a dad who can do these kinds of things.  He not only has saved us thousands of dollars, he is also a resource for my own learning and understanding of household work.   I know I'll never be as skilled in plumbing or electrician work, but its nice to know he is there to help me out.   Watching my neighbors has only deepended my thankfulness, as they are having trouble even getting someone in to hook up a washer and dryer.    On the gaming front, I've been putting some time into Horizons again.. it has be in its thrall.   Unreal Tournament 2004 has just arrived, and marks the first game purchase for some time.  It is a blast, and deffinitely wortth picking up.   I am sure it will be a favorite at our lan partys.  Im heading to see my sister this weekend.  She's cooking me a birthday dinner, and we'll be spending the night with her and her fiance.  Should be a good time.  This friday I intend to see the Dawn of the Dead remake... im sure ill get scared.. and thats why i have to see it.   Man.. zombies freak me out.  I wonder why.   Our local game enthusiast email group the monkeygames has started a gaming night on a semi-weekly basis.   We played rise of nations last night and had a great game.   I'm looking forward to the next time :)   All in all.. we're settling back into some normalcy.  The house is looking good.. and we're settling in well.    Ahhhhhhhhh..
