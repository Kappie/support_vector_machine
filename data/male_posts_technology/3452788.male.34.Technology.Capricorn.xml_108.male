If there was ever anyone who could fight and win, we knew it was you. Your inner strength, your upbeat personality, your will to live on your terms, affected everyone who knew you. Even during the fight of your life, you chose to put others first, whether sharing your laugh or smile, helping others feel better, or just keeping us fed. In the face of unimaginable odds, your strength and grace was an inspiration to us all.    Your body has lost this battle, but your soul has won it's freedom. You are free once more to laugh, love, play with cats, and give inspiration to everyone who ever knew you. Long after the tears have dried, the bills are paid, and the candy dish emptied, your love and light will live on in our hearts and memories forever, and we are all better for having you in our lives.
