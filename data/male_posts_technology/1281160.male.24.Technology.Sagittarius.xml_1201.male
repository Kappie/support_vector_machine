Instead our friendly Indian neighbourhood spiderman will be wearing an Indian traditional kurta with a mask ofcourse.  No, I am not talking about a Bollywood version of the Spiderman blockbuster series. I am talking about Spider-Man India, the comics.   Marvel COmics is bringing out a Indian version of Spiderman.   "Spider-Man India interweaves the local customs, culture and mystery of modern India, with an eye to making Spider-Manâ€™s mythology more relevant to this particular audience."
