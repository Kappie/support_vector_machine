Our 5 day Thanksgiving break is over. Back to a 5 day school week.
I hope you all had a good break. It went by fast for me.
(At least Winter Break is coming up in about 3 weeks.)

I don't know what really more to say now. Just it's back to the regular old school schedule.
OH, WAIT! If forgot to tell you I got the flu shot today. It hurt. My sisters also had to have it.
