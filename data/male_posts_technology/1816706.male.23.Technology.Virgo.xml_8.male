Right now I'm living with some guy from Boston and two 18 year old girls from Alaska.  The people at the hostel are really cool, we get a few people staying in our room for one night every once in a while.  I hiked Diamond Head yesterday with one of my room mates, the views were spectacular!  I'll try and put some pics up later today.  The bus system here is on strike right now so that is really limiting my travel which sucks, I can't get too far, but I've been walking a ton.  To give you an idea of what kind of people are here, last night, the group I went to a bar with was 2 girls from Germany, two guys from Texas, including me, one guy from Australia, one guy from Boston, and one guy from Philly.  I've actually seen a fair amount of Texans around, saw some people sporting UT shirts in a bar last night.   All for now.
