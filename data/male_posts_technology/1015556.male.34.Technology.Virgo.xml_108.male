It was really fun, just to hear how they are doing and how God is moving in their lives.  Interestingly enough, all of them that were there went to Urbana.  It really was a great time.  The funniest part was the Vegemite eating contest, thanks for Ryan.  Andrew was the funniest, poor guy.  Very encouraging, God's word is bearing fruit.
