It definitely scores over alternatives such as DSL in many aspects, though it can be argued that the difference wouldn't really matter for regular browsing (depends on what the definition of "regular" is, of course). I was a DSL user a few months back and had a difficult time watching streaming movies over the net. I see the DSL companies coming up with innovative ads to regain their market share from the cable internet companies.  Speaking of internet connection speeds, it seems a new record for the fastest internet connection was set recently, a whopping 4.23 Gbps !!, as  urlLink vnunet.com  reports. That kind of speed is insane, I should say..
