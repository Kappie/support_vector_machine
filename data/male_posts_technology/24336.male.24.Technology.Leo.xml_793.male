If the car is impressive in 85% complete form and Lutz is driving this home as the most important GM project, the final result is going to be amazing.  

UPDATE:  The car may only have 170 HP, but it also have 170 lb-ft in comparison to the 142 HP and 125 lb-ft found in a base Miata.   Even the new Mazdaspeed version only has 178 hp and 166 lb-ft.
