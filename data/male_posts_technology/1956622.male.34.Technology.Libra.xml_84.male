How could things have gotten so off course that I have lost my daughter and a woman that I loved so much.  I really tried to get her to come back to me.  If only she had given me another month or so to see that the medication I was taking for depression was helping.  It was changing me from the man I had become.  I begged her to return to me which was a stupid move on my part but never the less I did it.    I feel torn between what I now have to do and what I still wish for.  I think it is wrong to take Karissa away from her brothers but at the same time I feel Lisa (this post I have decided to not use SFW)is not the person she used to be.  I am not sure if it is her attempt to become something else...midlife crisis after turning 30 or what but she is not the same person.   I wish so much for the good times of the past but know that they are dead.  I wish for Karissa to have her parents at the same time but that too is gone.  I swore from the time I was a kid I would not do the divorce thing to my kids but here I am.  Given the things that Lisa did to me I should not feel guilty but I do.    Maybe I am just tired it has been almost 24 hours without sleep and I have an hour long bike ride home which I am not looking forward to.  It is good for me and once I get going I will probably think differently but right now...  I worry about if I get Karissa can I be the father that is expected of me.  Can I make the daddy that she deserves.  If I don't get Karissa what will I do?  I have to be honest I truly miss my daughter and even now want to just go pick her up but I can't and that sucks.  She is less then a mile from my house and I cannot go see her.  I want Karissa to live with me but I know Karissa would miss being with her mommy and her brothers.    I will continue forward because I have to and because Lisa thinks she will automatically win.  Nothing in life is automatic. Lisa has said one of the reasons she got involved with  ONE  of her affairs was that the Dr. made her feel like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman and all I can say to that is that a lot of women see that movie and view it as the prince charming saves the princess movie but everyone seems to forget that under all that glamour and zip she was found hooking on the streets and is nothing more then a common whore.  So I guess if the shoe fits Lisa...  Now if you are a regular reader you may have thought I was having cold feet or something but all I can say is I was just looking at the stars and pondering and this is kind of the stuff I was pondering (Luckily I think faster then I type) so don't worry all plans are still a go and until I run out of money so am I.
