Those are times when no one you want, no one you need cares. No one is there to comfort a crumbling soul. When everyone forms their social-circle and watches you burn from within, watches you suffer. And no matter how ample the cries for help, they refuse to come to the rescue. Is there ever anyone there?  If you're crying yourself to sleep, I'll cry myself to sleep with you.  If you're hurt, I'll hold you until you're better, and then even more.  I Love You more than anything. Forever.  ===============  Have you ever wanted to kill someone  else's  parents?
