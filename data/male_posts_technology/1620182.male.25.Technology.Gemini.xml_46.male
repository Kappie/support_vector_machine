And only one conference has UVa in it.  The ACC.  UVa's conference is the ACC.  And they rock.  So we'll forgive the stupid old men who put money into the "medieval studies" program with equal measure to the computer science department.  You know what?  Let's go there right now.  It's only 1 x 10^4 miles away, we can hack it before happy hour is over.  Who's thirsty?  I'm buying.  We'll go to Maarten's and afterwere nice and soused take the lint and buttons left in our pockets for some slowass service and hard liqour at the Greenskeeper.

Wahoo are easy to distinguish from their cousins,  urlLink the king mackerel [neutered rooster] , by the long snout [wang], [two and a] half [times] the length of the head. Louisiana [uh, Virginia] wahoo typically display brilliant vertical bands of blue [and orange] running down the sides of the [drunk as a] fish [football fan]."
