The premise of this project is that it combines two files to create a third completely different file with a .mono extension.  See it works like this...  Let's say you have:   Metallica-Master_of_Puppets.mp3  And you create a text file with enough characters to make the files the same size. We'll call this file, junk.txt groovy? groovy.  Now Monolith will take the two files and "munge" them together. You now have a file called munge.mono or something similar. The contents of this file are neither of the original files, yet they are both of the original files. (mmm quantum states...) Anyhoo, this new file is not, nor can it be copyrighted, and therefore is free to be distributed since none of the data contained has anything to do with the copyrighted Metallica song.  The nifty part is, what a person does with this file is totally up to them. They could for instance get a copy of your junk.txt file and extract "Master of Puppets" from it, but ONLY with an exact copy of junk.txt in this particular case. To bring this all together junk.txt is not a copyrighted file is it? Nope, we just made it... I guess you could go TRY to copyright it but that is neither here nor there. Avoiding further digression, junk.txt is free to distribute right along side your munge.mono. When the person you send this to gets the files he/she can run their Monolith and combine the junk.txt and the munge.mono files to pull out the Metallica-Mater_of_Puppets.mp3 file. Of course their ownership of that file is subject to scrutiny but the trasferring of data cannot be considered criminal, since the data transmitted has absolutely no copyrighted content within it.    -intX    UNO!
