Then we got home like around noon, had lunch, I packed for Amit's, and then I was on my way to the three hour band rehearsal - ON A SATURDAY!!! After that, though, it was all good. The band rehearsal went well, and we got a break in the middle for a quick snack of chocolate-chip cookies and chips. We did out concert run-through the first half, then we fixed the problems in the second half. The sleepover with Amit and Robert @ Amit's house was really fun (I forgot Amit's present). We went bowling (I won 2/3 games), then we went home and played video games, both on the big-screen and on the screen in Amit's room, and watched 2Fast2Furious on the projection-screen. We had pizza as usual. Then we made a movie (which is already being done edited in iMovie). It is about RC cars. We played F-Zero GX, Burnout 2, Need For Speed Underground, and a lot more. We had pancakes for breakfast (we woke up @ about 10:00), then we did a bit more and packed up. I went home at about 12:00 (noon).
