After several months of campaigning, and a couple of back room deals, Roy had selected me as best man, so I felt compelled to attend.  The wedding was in Bozeman so we drove to Wyoming Friday afternoon, stayed the night, and then drove on to Bozeman on Saturday.  The wedding itself was on Monday so we had plenty of time.   The bachelor party was Saturday night, and in perfect geek style, involved 4 xboxes and plenty of Halo and Crimson Skies.  The wedding itself was a lot of fun.  A friend of Roy’s drove in from Pennsylvania and cooked an awesome three turn (aka course)  meal and I ate more than I thought I could.  The next morning Daen and I left for Idaho for stop two of the journey, but not before waiting for Pickle Barrel to open to get some sandwiches for the road.  Oh, and it was worth every minute of the wait, they are as good as I remember.  We then spent two days in Sun Valley Idaho.  When I was growing up my family would always spend part of the summer there.  I hadn’t been back for about 10 years, and it had changed a bit, but not too much.  The most interesting thing for me was how much smaller everything looked.  I just seem to remember the resort property being so much bigger…  I guess I was a tad bit smaller back then though, so I’ll take that excuse over any “The world is shrinking” options.  Daen was nice enough to tolerate my 2 day stroll down memory lane, where we did more looking and talking about things than actually doing them.  We ended the trip with three nights in Vegas.  I’ve been there before, but never with my wife.  I think we both had a great time.  We rode all the rides, including the new one at the Star Trek Experience, and saw a couple shows.  I had never been a but Circus Ole (no, that’s not how you spell it, but it’s the best I can do) fan, but seeing it live is a whole other thing.  If you ever get the chance I HIGHLY recommend it.  Except for Zoomanity, that show wasn’t very good, but the rest is great.  On the 8 hour drive home we realized we had driven all around Utah, but never ventured in.  I’m sure there’s some meaning to that, but I won’t speculate on it now.  We did stop in Grants New Mexico to visit the only 4B’s outside Montana.  Those not from Montana won’t know what I mean when I say “4B’s Tomato Soup”, but those who do know will understand why we stopped and got 2 bowls to go.  So that was the trip in a nutshell.  Not a large nut shell, but not a small one either.  Let’s call it a peanut shell, one that has three nuts in it.  A long bumpy shell with three main spots.  In fact,  I think that about sums up our trip actually, and long ride (2900 mile, 40 hours, 100 gallons of gas) and three destinations.
