"The residents and the Board is opposed to the REI development but it hopes to persuade the council members not coerce them into seeing our point of view. With that said, I hope that in the future you will check with the Rookery Woods Homeowners Association Board members before you accuse us of activities/actions of others. RAIZ is not Rookery Woods and one individual does not a sub-division make. Do not paint all residents of Rookery Woods with a broad brush."  I appreciate these corrections and will be the first to admit any mistakes made in any of my posts. I apologize to the Homeowners Association for associating them with RAIZ. I would however suggest that the Homeowners Association find out why their name is appearing on anonymous flyers being distributed with the RAIZ logo on it if they are not associated with the RAIZ group.
