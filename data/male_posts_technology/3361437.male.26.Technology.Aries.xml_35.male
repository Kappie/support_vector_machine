When you post WordprocessingML documents on the Internet, you can include the  Word XML Viewer to expand your online audience to people who might not have  Word, or to those with previous versions.  This download includes the  released version of the WordprocessingML to HTML transformation, which allows  the viewer to display WordprocessingML files saved by Word 2003 by transforming  the WordprocessingML file into HTML from within Internet Explorer.
