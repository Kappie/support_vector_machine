(About 30% of goal)  $50 @ Boswells (17% fo goal).  7 more Jack and Cokes (Almost 10% of goal).  1.5 hours more of kickboxing (33% of goal).   On a side note, I have a bit of a gripe. You ever take your car in to get the rear view mirror adjusted and you leave the garage $800 later having been told you need new breaks, a new flex compactor, and a flush and refill of blinker fluid. I didn't know blinkers needed fluid! Fucken assholes...I might as well wear a shirt that says:  "I'm a total asshole and will pay top dollar for nothing because I don't know shit about cars!"  This is where having a Dad would have proved instrumental! Now you try to rip me off on bad produce...look out! I can spot a bruise on an eggplant from a 100 yards out!
