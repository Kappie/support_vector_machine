I even appreciate the brief break from Karate, it's given me time off to heal (skinned knuckles don't heal very quickly, just ask Uma Thurman) and get some of my motivation back as well.  After assessing my current state of affairs, I've realised that the NZ tournament looks very sketchy now because I'm expecting the approval of my permanent residency soon. If my predictions are accurate, it will be a case of not having a passport on hand to travel to NZ while immigration goes through the very elaborate and lengthy (4 weeks I've been told) process of sticking a permanent visa sticker into it. Oh well, it's no big deal... there's always the Australian Nationals in August, plus I've gone through too much and come too far to complain. It's insignificant in the grand scheme of things.  Cancelling flight bookings can be a bitch though.
