It was different than other flying dreams I've had over the last few years though. Usually when I fly I control my altitude by taking deep breaths. The deeper I breath the higher I go. And every other time I've had dreams where I could fly I was always in a Superman-like position; head first, prone, perhaps an arm out front to lead the way. But this time I was in sort of a seated position which seems awkward to me. I controlled my position and movement more through leaning forward and backward, left and right. I felt like I didn't have quite as much control over my movement but my altitude was much easier to maintain. I wasn't flying for any particular purpose that I can remember. In the past I have flown from the doors of the building I work in to my car or some other location. I'm not sure I have it logged in here anywhere but a couple of years ago I had a flying dream where I left work and took to the air to find my car. I looked down in the parking lot and instead of seeing cars zipping out of the gates I saw many brightly colored llamas filing neatly out of the lots. They threaded their way neatly and courteously through the rows and aisles of the parking lots. No, I don't smoke, inject, or snort anything or pop any pills. This stuff is all natural. I'm just that strange. I had once written a poem about flying in my dreams but it got locked away in a zip file to which I forgot the password... along with several others I thought I'd never want anyone to see.  That brings on another thought though. Why wouldn't I want someone to see them. Really. I used to write stuff in high school all the time. I had two whole comp books full of them by the end of my senior year. I'm too stupid to save stuff like that though. The only thing remaining from my high school years is my letter jacket (the ugliest thing you could ever imagine) and my yearbooks. I don't wear the jacket because it's so ugly and my arms are about two inches longer now than they were in school. I don't look at the yearbooks because I don't really have a good reason to. I only had about two friends. The rest were girlfriends and girls I wanted to date but could either never get up the nerve to ask or just never had the right timing. All I ever did looking back at them was wonder why I dated the ones I did and why I never dated the ones I didn't.  The point is I used to write poems and share them with Kris. Any other day I could have told you her last name but for some reason I can't come up with it right now. Starts with a K or a hard C. Kurth. That's it. Kristina Kurth. Anyway, I used to show them to her and she was mildly amused. Most of them were goofy, but they all meant something to me. Should have saved them. Maybe then I could remember who I was then.  I know for sure though that I never had dreams in which I could fly. I like these dreams and I hope they keep coming back.
