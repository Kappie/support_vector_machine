Oh well, the other guy called in sick today, so I guess it's good I showed up.  For some Odd reason, I feel that setting up my voicemail isn't that important... Of course it might have to do with the fact that I know I'm leaving, and my boss doesn't. Damn 2 week notifications.  Anyway, I am back on my "wanting to write" stick, but am yet somehow distracted by other things(final fantasy).  I hope Amidy had a nice time on her birthday weekend. I didn't get out much cause of the snow.  check you guys later- T
