Much like the Bush-Gore debacle of 2000, a few thousand votes will end up being the difference in who gets to govern this country.  Now, there is a significant difference between the U.S. and Canadian political systems. In Canada, we don't vote for a Prime Minister. When I voted an hour ago, I voted for one person - my local Member of Parliament. At the end of the night, the party with the most MP's gets to form the government.   What makes it even more interesting is the prospect of a minority government. A minority government is one that needs the support of another party (or parties) to pass its legislation. Minority governments tend to last only a year or so before they fall, and another election is required.
