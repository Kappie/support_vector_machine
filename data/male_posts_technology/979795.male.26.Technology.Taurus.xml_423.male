If you read a few posts earlier, you'd know that I had missed training at Bt Batok last Mon coz I was stupid to have taken the wrong MRT line. Not once byt twice.  Well, yesterday I finished classes at 5.30pm, left school immediately and boaded bus 135 to Paya Lebar MRT. No way was I gonna be on the wrong line now because this time I only needed to change 1 stop before I alighted (@  Jurong East MRT Interchange). From the East to the West there were already a lot of people at the time as it was after school and work. I had to stand together with a crowd all the way until I alighted. Was so tired and sleepy. I forced myself to read my book instead of standing and falling asleep. Well, I got to Bt Batok MRT to change TIBS 177 to go down to the CC. Waited there for a good 10 mins before some young sec sch kid politely told me "Mr, I think you missed the last bus for 177 already. The service has ended at this time." I felt blur man. It was only 7pm and the last bus had left? Geez... I wanted to kill myself then. Felt so hungry by then. Bt Batok Central was a shopping mall and I could find lotsa food there, but I seriously was in NO mood to be hanging around there any longer. Thought I may still make it if I could find one of those bus which went in the direction of BB East CC. Went out to the main road and accidentally took a service which took me to Boon Lay. At this time I was in a pissed mood already. Decided to go Holland V for dinner and cool off. I took the MRT from Boon Lay to Buona Vista and walked towards Holland V. When I passed by the bus stop nearby, my usual bus home (105) arrived. I decided, "Oh heck with dinner!" and hopped right on to go home.  Got home, still in a pissy mood. When I entered the house, first thing my Dad asked was "Had dinner?" Was in no mood to be nice so all I said was "Already told you this morning I'm not eating at home right?" He could tell something was wrong and left me alone. I went straight up, changed into my running gear and went for a night run. Didn't feel like bringing the house keys with me this time. (The previous time I didn't bring my keys, the front gate actually konked out. When I got home I pressed the button and waited to no avail. Had to scale the damn door like we usually did back in NS for the 'Suicide Window' of the obstacle course. I was hoping that the electronic gate might've konked out again so I could use some spare energy to hop over the gate again. Yea, sounds stupid, but I that's how I felt.) Went for a 3km run, which felt good. I think I made good progress this time. But it was horrible running along Stevens with traffic on the road, all other roads I ran along were a slight distance away so it didn't feel that bad. I got back in good time (and mood) and took a 1.25 litre bottle of water from the fridge. Sat along the steps outside my house to try and cool down and enjoy the breeze in what was an unusually nice and breezy evening in Singapore. I might've been sitting there whistling tunes for a good 30mins or so before I went to grab a cold shower. Shower never felt that shiok before either. I'd just stand there letting the cold water trickle from the top of my head down to my toes.  Sometimes no matter how bad a day may seem, there's always a silver lining to be found. Even if it means that you had to spin the thread out yourself from cotton plants, but it's there... somewhere out there lah...
