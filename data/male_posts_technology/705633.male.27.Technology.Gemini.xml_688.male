Well I wondered about a bluffer's guide to menus, a kind of food glossary. So if you're out with a lady friend and she asks you what a bundnerfleisch is, you can cunningly reply that it is a Swiss salt-cured, air-dried beef similar to (but considered superior to) Africa's biltong.   The good part is,  urlLink it does already exist . Genius.
