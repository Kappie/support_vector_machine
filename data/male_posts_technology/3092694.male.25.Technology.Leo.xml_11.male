Finding that the internet is largely a receptacle for digital images of chubby older women and their cats.  Also on the internet, pics of pg-13 models.  Also on the internet, screen shots of video games.  Also on the internet, not what I'm looking for. So far have discovered internet=rubbish bin, and where to get the magical sword in the tenth frame of "super lame dungeon master 5."  Did however buy a camera on eBay from a man in Russia.  So, that's a plus.
