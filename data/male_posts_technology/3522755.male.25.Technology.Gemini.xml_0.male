If there are rats, mice, birds or any other animals, the attic is where they will be.   chantal:  Have not, was open when I got back last Sunday night. Maybe it happened due to wind or whatsoever, will climb up there and close it.   cristina:  Let him do it, with a bit of luck he will break his neck.  i think cristina accidentally put me in the cc..... you know it always surprise me how low and nasty human can be.  i was thinking of writing a nasty reply but in the end i only wrote "that's very nice of you, cristina, it's great to hear 1st thing in the morning that someone who shares a flat with me is wishing me dead!"  am i pathetic? i should have go slap her in the face or something, hahahahhaha
