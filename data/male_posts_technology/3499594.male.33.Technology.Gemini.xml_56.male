That's right, Thursday, Friday night and Saturday without my precious. We feel lost without them. But as much as I miss them, I am really enjoying time alone with my wife. Thursday night we ordered pizza (didn't have to have pepperoni) and watched 13 going on 30 all before 9 p.m.! yeah, you might think, 'wow, what party animals'. But it was nice to be able to sit watch and relax before anyone else was in bed.   Friday's work day was pretty good. I was able to accomplish alot and felt like I was all over the place. I worked on 2 projects, on 2 conference calls, assisted 3 people, and was able to update some documentation. All in all a productive day. I am still seeing the Chiropracter, had a visit at 8 a.m. before work today. Same thing, keep up the excercises and see my twice again next week. But I have to say my wrist has not hurt at all since I been going. So something is working right.   Friday evening my wife and I enjoyed the evening out. We ate out at LoneStar steakhouse (I had a peppercorn steak and my wife ate steak and shrimp) yes it was good. We then gathered some supplies, cookies, soda for PTA. Did I mention my wife is PTA president and I was voted Treasurer this year? Can't recall if I did. Oh well. We  grabbed the stuff. I also grabbed two movies to watch, Swordfish (seen it before but wanted to again) and Hart's War(haven't seen that one), both for 1.99 each so couldn't pass renting those. We also were able to leasurely walk through Walmart, so we put on a Christmas layaway for the kids. Have to start on it due to being around the corner and the fact I get paid once a month.   Anyway, the evenings have been really nice but we continue to call the kids to check on them. They are being spoiled rotten as usual and enjoying time with their grandparents. School starts on the 11th here. The school has an open house on the evening of the 10th. PTA will furnish the refreshments, hence the soda's and cookies. We will also have a member drive that evening. Another exciting event is my buddy will be starting up a 4H here in Pocola, which they have not had before.   The other best thing, is the spontaneity my wife and I can have without the kids. I will leave that to you imaginations. :  )
