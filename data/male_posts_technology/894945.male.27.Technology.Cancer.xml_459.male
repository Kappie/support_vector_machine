Anyway here something that I think is true on about how they reacted to what u act like.   FINE This is the word women use to end an argument when they feel they are right and you need to shut up. Never use "fine" to describe how  a woman looks. This will cause you to have one of those arguments.  FIVE MINUTES This is half an hour. It is equivalent to the "five minutes" that your football game is going to last before you take out the trash, so it's an even trade.  NOTHING This means something and you should be on your toes. "Nothing" is usually used to describe the feeling a woman has of wanting to turn  you inside out, upside down and backwards. "Nothing" usually signifies an  argument that will last "Five Minutes" and end with the word "Fine."  GO AHEAD (With Raised Eyebrows) This is a dare. One that will result in a woman getting upset over "Nothing," and will end with the word "Fine."  GO AHEAD (Normal Eyebrows) This means "I give up" or "do what you want because I don't care." You will get a Raised Eyebrow "Go Ahead" in just a few minutes,  followed by "Nothing" and "Fine," and she will talk to you in about "Five  Minutes" when she cools off.  LOUD SIGH This is not actually a word but is a non-verbal statement often misunderstood by men. A "Loud Sigh" means she thinks you are an idiot at that moment and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you over "Nothing."  SOFT SIGH Again, not a word but a non-verbal statement. "Soft Sighs" mean that she is content. Your best bet is to not move or breathe and she will  stay content.  THAT'S OKAY This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can make to a man. "That's Okay" means that she wants to think long and hard  before paying you back for whatever it is that you have done. "That's Okay" is to be in some mighty big trouble.  PLEASE DO This is not a statement, it is an offer. A woman is giving you the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have for doing whatever it is that you have done. You have a fair chance with the truth,  so be careful and you shouldn't get a "That's Okay."  THANKS A woman is thanking you. Do not faint. Just say you're welcome.  THANKS A LOT This is much different than "Thanks." A woman will say "Thanks A Lot" when she is really ticked off at you. It signifies that you have offended her in some callous way and will be followed by the "Loud Sigh."  Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the Loud Sigh," as she will  only tell you "Nothing."
