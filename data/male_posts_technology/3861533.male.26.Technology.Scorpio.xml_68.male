Great actors, most notably  urlLink Ray Winstone  as Henry.  urlLink Helena Bonham Carter  is also good as Anne Boleyn.

Nevertheless, it still got me interested in this time period. Last time a movie peaked my interest in British history was last year in  urlLink To Kill A King . I guess I'll be adding British history to the (bottom) of my to-read-about list.     -->
