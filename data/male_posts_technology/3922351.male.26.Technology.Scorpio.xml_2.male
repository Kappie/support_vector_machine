I got to watch it from a screener...using bit torrent.  This is an important film. If it assists in changing the US prez. Then great because any country that has stood shoulder to shoulder with Bush has been given a shit sandwich.  I must say that although Michael Moore is excellent at presenting an alternative to the world media that it is still one mans voice. The world needs a diverse range of media easily available...
