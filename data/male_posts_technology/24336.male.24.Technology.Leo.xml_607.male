     

      About a week ago, I sent out an email to just about everyone in my address book that didn't live in Washington.  The email outlined my new contact info for both home and work and that's about it.  Well, some people didn't seem to appreciate this information:

Mike,  

 

I want you to stay completely out of my life, that is, after all, why I 

broke up with you.  This means that I do not want to hear from you and I 

do not want you contacting, in any way, my friends and family.  Trust me, 

they do not want to hear from you either.  I did not email you earlier 

because I did not want to talk to you.  I don't care about your new 

address and phone number.  I don't care about your new job.  In short, I 

don't care about what you are doing with your life.  I also do not care 

for you to know what is going on in my life.  

 

If you are looking for closure, here it is.  I broke up with you because 

you made me miserable.  You were emotionally abusive and controlling.  

You put me down and made me feel stupid for being myself.  When I broke 

up with you, I was too afraid of you to be this direct.  I am not anymore 

and I am sick of you trying to weasel your way back into my life.  Leave 

my friends alone.  Leave my family alone.  Leave me alone.  

 

Laura 

 



Seeing as how a regular reply might not be appreciated either and I always need to get the last word in, here is my open letter of reply:



 

Laura,  



First off, relax.  We have not talked since the beginning of this  

year.  I sent two emails over that period of time inquiring about your  

well-being.  I love how that is considered me trying to weasel my way  

back into your life!  I send an email to everyone in my address book about  

my new contact info and this is the reply that I get?  That is just a bit  

dramatic!  



Twice you mentioned leaving your family and friends alone.  I can only  

assume that you brought this up because they received the same contact  

info email as you did.  Had I known that would upset them so much, I  

definitely would have reconsidered sending it to them!  Sarcasm aside, I  

will not trust you when you say they don't want to hear from me.  A few of  

your friends didn't like me while we were together and I'm sure a few more  

switched sides when you broke up with me.  I do know that certain people,  

including at least one sibling of yours, think differently.  You may have  

requested that they all shun me but that cannot affect their true  

feelings.  Who is being the controlling one now?  It's a shame that you  

cannot trust them to make their own decisions.  



I made you feel stupid?  I'm sorry; I must have acted as a mirror of some  

sort, allowing you to see yourself for who you truly are.  It does not take  

much for someone whose only intellectual hobby is to watch VH1 for hours  

on end to think of themselves as being stupid.  Try reading a book.   

Better yet, try challenging yourself!  Outside of your required courses,  

did you take anything difficult in college?  I know you didn't make it  

into the honors program, but there are some difficult classes offered to  

the rest of the school as well.  



So, you broke up with me so that I would stay completely out of your life?   

Is that how it works?  Why is it that so many other people have the ability  

to break up and at least be cordial?  Actually, if I remember correctly,  

you have no contact whatsoever with any of your exes.  Why is that?  Do you  

understand how to forgive people?  Are your emotional abilities so  

black-and-white that once you break up with someone, all emotion toward  

them must turn to hate?  Do you even understand how to separate the  

concepts of friend and significant other?  Hopefully you will learn with  

Alex.  Hey, he was one of my good friends back in elementary school.  He was  

probably one of the main reasons why we broke up and still I do not hate  

him.  Forgive and forget.  



Here is my take on the situation as a whole.  You met Alex while we were  

together and while our relationship was having problems.  Having a small  

shred of morality, you knew that you couldn't cheat so you decided to  

break up with me to be with him.  Though we did have problems, there was  

still some good in the relationship.  While you were with Alex, you had to  

channel that emotional energy somewhere.  The easiest emotion to channel  

into is hate, so there it went!  It is much easier to hate someone with  

support from people you are close to so you slandered me enough to gain  

this support.  When you saw my latest email, you felt a slight twinge of  

interest but you had to kill it.  Instead of forgiving and forgetting, you  

redirected that twinge into the anger spewed forth in your email.  For that  

emotional outburst, I applaud you.  



Even if I am completely wrong, know that you have now proved yourself as  

the paragon of emotional puerility you were destined to become.  



M.
