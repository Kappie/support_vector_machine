Add the heat issues that Intel is stating are the primary reason for the next generation P4 demise, to the never ending deadline for Microsoft Longhorn, one begins to see and appreciate the reasons why the Macintosh platform should be avoided at all costs.  If after 8:15 in the morning your machine was running without a hitch, that would require that you do a full days work. Everyone knows it is much more enjoyable to chase down phantom security holes, fiddle with the "dip" switches and unexpected performance failures as your full time profession.
