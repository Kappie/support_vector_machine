We had a kind of individual performance review/project update by our supervisor so that kinda dragged for a bit. But yeah it was good cos I gotta tell him stuff that I really wanted to tell him; that I was feeling really unmotivated at work and that I would rather work on team-based projects instead of individual ones. And I was told I needed to be more energetic when it comes to tasks that I didn't really like to do; which is really true, when I have no interest in the task I have assigned I tend to like delay doing it. Need to really work on that.
