Why do i do what i do?  well when i think of these 7 words i just dont know where to start and where to end...do i really know this...but then why do i want to know this...whats the problem with my life that i have think such imaginary things and try to find meaning in everything i am doing...  but thats where i question...if you dont know what u are doing..then why are u doing it...why?   atleast one should think on this...the thought would make u see things in a different way...today i am much more calm and serene and feel much in control...not because i know the answer but because i do live to a certain degree on my own choices....  this itself brings such a peace in me...makes me at ease with my surroundings...thats what i guess is the esense of being an individual...i have not left my job or my relationships...i still go to office every day and work with people....i still live in a way bound by obligations and relations and commitments...  but if u ask me i would still say i am free some where inside me...thats what is the challenge and thats what is the reward...being amidst the every day life and still smile about it...able to see it from the higher ground or from the 3rd person account really makes u see what u are doing...once u are able to do it then i guess its easier for one to look at urself and ask what does this one want...  i may rant about the whole thing about the individual and its way of life...but we still have to meet the societical commitments somewhere...thats where the whole crux actually is...being part and yet being out of it...being involved and yet being unemotional...  i try...i try..hope to reach a balance and make others see it also...
