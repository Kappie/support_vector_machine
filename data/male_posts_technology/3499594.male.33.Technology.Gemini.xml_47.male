Seems the harddrive crashed hard and they are replacing that one and having to install all new software. I hate it. Not only will I be behind, I will be further behind now due to not even having it back yet. I left 2 voicemails on 2 different peoples offices and no word back nor any vm's in my bin at all. Very frustrating.   I leave for Pennsylvania on Saturday and return next Friday. I dread it. I never get anything done while I am up there. I am swamped with meetings, ect and constant disruptions.   We drove to Little Rock and back today. My son had another Dr. visit and followup. Seems most checked out ok. He is still doing well from last Monday so this is good.   School starts in less than 3 weeks! Our kids school start on the 11th. I will be gone one of the 3 weeks and I am the new PTA Treasurer. Much to do and no time to do it in.   I spoke with a gentlemen midway to Little Rock asking the consensus on peoples view, Kerry or Bush. He basically told me he would vote for a hounddog before Bush. I informed him Kerry hasn't even been doing his current job, missing 2/3 votes but managed to not support Defense for our troops, vote against the partial birth abortion ban, ect. But his mind was already settled. I truly do not understand why individuals would put our fellow americans in harms way, only for the reason of hatred.
