Just had a good time with Pure Joy yesterday with some cheeky and crazy people having fun in cell learning the Word .  Work was also good...being bored at times...alredi filled with exams to certify myself for the work and out of probations soon. Got training after trainings and nearly compromised cell (Pure Joy) time and well i gave my excuse for a family gathering ( indeed Pure Joy have been family to me) and that excuse got me out of that communication training. Oh well that trainer will be joining the company soon.  Was just wondering at times...and praying for the cell, for the ppl....mostly of course...just thinking about her..(yes the mysterious gal) ..about serving God ..with her... Thought about Valentime's day too about sending her flowers in person to the office...heheh...eh what the heck am i posting on the web for...  Continue to dream and pray in faith that all thing works for good for those who loved Him. ..  God have indeed brought me a long way and more than i could hope for or dream of...a good job with good career advancement ...with good employers and fanstastic teammates...good cell (Pure JOy and Simply united) , best of the best frens, self adopted families..(wai nyan's and pastor chew) , fanstastic leaders  and most of all awesome church to serve in .  Simply Put it ...Just Jesus.    Ok...put thing on the right track...just previously i have posted a guide for the bloggers of malaysia...I hope u will capture what and who our blogs can capture the attention and impact because our blogs are open to the people,...  OK for now..i'll blog later.  Regards from Fellow JesusFreaks Joshua Tan Connect, Relate and Resonate JOshua Tan
