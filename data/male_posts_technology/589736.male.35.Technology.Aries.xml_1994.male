Now that Dean has abandoned his no attacking policy, I wonder how long it will be before Edwards does as well.  I am also curious as to why Wes Clark is spending so much money on TV ads in Virginia at this early juncture.  While it is a very good introctory ad, I have seen it enough times now to have a couple of questions about its veracity.  I am not saying that he has lied or even stretched the truth, but I don't think he has put forth the whole truth.  I really doubt that he had much to do with the actually negotiating the peace in Serbia.  He probably had a roll, but we have diplomats to handle these things and soldiers to enforce them.  Also, he comments that this was done without the loss of American lives.  The biggest difference is that we went in to an area where they hate each other (Serbs/Croats) more than they hate us.  In Iraq, the insurgents hate us, not the Shiites/Sunnis.  Yet again, I still have not heard a proposed answer to the situation (other than Dean's saying we need to pull out totally, now).  If you want to lead, you need to have answers, not just point out the obvious problems.
