Hopefully you're old enough to remember the song by The Church from "way back" in the early 90's. If not, may I suggest that you check it out a.s.a.p.    Most often, I'll be posting this from work. But, every so often, I may have the time to do this from home as well.    I don't have a cell phone/camera so posting pictures may be a problem. We'll get through it, I'm sure.    Let me be clear on this: I could  NOT  care less why Ricky Williams retired! Further, what's the big deal with a few tokes on some pot, huh?    Whatever.
