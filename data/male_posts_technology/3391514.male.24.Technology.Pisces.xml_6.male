Its not that its a bad film... just very VERY underwhelming.  The action is formulaic, the music is formaulaic (and odd in places... imagine the music from The Mummy interspersed with bizarre guitars) and the acting is typical of the action movie genre.  At least it had Zombie-Dalek-Ewoks.  In other news, there were some results from the opticians... looks like my  visit  is to be going ahead soon... wonderful news.  Sarcasm does not translate well into text.  Remember!  Life is great!
