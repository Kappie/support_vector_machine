Thanks to the good graces of a well-known anti-spyware device things are returning to normal, but my usual paranoia has been catapulted through the roof.  In other news, the WoD game ran, from 10pm till 3.30am.  It was amusing and more than a little insane... but really showed holes in my GMing and knowledge of the system while running it.  It seems when I'm a player I can easily remember the rules, but as a GM I don't and thus resort to winging it.  It seems my home game is not going ahead as one of my players is unwell.  A pity, as he makes up 50% of the group.  Finally, my current monetary difficulties may be solved.  With the impending operation I may be able to get some kind of income support.  Which is nice.
