Ann has to give a presentation at 4:00 so we will probably leave right after that.      I hate Norton AntiVirus.  It is a nice program and all, but man is it slow.  I work for a help desk and everytime a virus alert comes out the next day we get a ton of calls, because Norton's is making the computer run slow.  You would think that making users not have to do work would be a good thing...but none the less.  Saw Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back... it  was a pretty entertaining movie.  I love when movies have background stories and this one was a king of having background stories.  Characters from Clerks, Chasing Amy (still yet to see but want to) and Mall Rats (the kid is on the escalator again!) all make up this very eclectic cast.  Sometimes Justin reminds me of Jay...obnoxious, yet it is not bad having him around.  I could see Tom and Justin as a good Jay and Silent Bob combo....or Nic and Lyle.  I have been reading up on the films and stuff that Kevin Smith says.  He seems to be a very intelligent guy.  It is funny, because most of the stuff in the films are based on real people or events...well maybe no the diamond heist, but you know what I mean.  It is said there are plans for a cartoon version of mall rats to come out...I am not sure how that will work.  The cartoon version of Clerks was well...not good.  Okay...not much else to say...Kritin?  No mocking in this one...until then...
