He knows what things one can and cannot eat since he has read almost the whole book. I hate reading, so he tells me what to do :)My body my react interestingly since yesterday I drank 5 sodas which had 39 carbs each, along with some candy, and otherfoods that were high in carbs. It will be in carb shock today :)    I started out today at 292 pounds, so we will see where I end up.    Today I started the process they call Induction, where you "Induce" your body to use Fat for energy instead of sugars. During this phase, someone can have up to 20 grams of Carbs each day.    Today for breakfast I ate 2 eggs and 2 pieces of sausage. So far that means I've eatten 2.2 carbs today. (.6 grams for each egg and 1 gram for the 2 pieces of sausage)    I also went to my old high school and walked about it five times. If I remember right, thats 1.5 miles and I did this in 15 minutes. So far today, I feel good and still have plenty of energy. I went grocery shopping to gather things I need for the diet. I bought about $70 worth of stuff, and still really didn't end up with much at all. I doubt the stuff will last a week. I've drank 2 cups of Crystal Light so far.    For now, all is good, lets just hope I can keep doing this....     1:30 PM   For Dinner I had2 cups ofsalad which was 1 carb for two cups, and some salad dressing that was .75 carbs for 2 Tbps. I also had some pork spare ribs which has 0 carbs, and half a cup of green beans for 2.9 carbs. That means so far today, I've had 2.2 from breakfast and4.65 for lunch for a total of6.85 carbs out of 20 total possible. I have 13.15 left for the rest of the day.     6:57 PM   For Supper I had 1 cup of green beans for a total of 5.8 carbs. I also had some more pork spare ribs with 0 carbs. Ialso ate some salad and dressing for 1.75 carbs, and some pork rinds for.5 carbs. So far today, that means I've eatten a total of 14.9 so I have5.1 carbs left today :)
