It sure is nice to be able to kick it with a good band on a Wednesday night in the city!  They were decent as usual, the lead singer always puts on a hilarious performance.  But going to these rock shows, especially ones like Zebrahead, sure do make me feel old.  A 25 year old is an old man at these shows, where the majority of the crowd is in HS.  I probably threw stuff at people that were as old as me when I was their age.  And whoever got hit probably deserved it.  A good old fashioned punk (though poppy) show doesn't need someone slaving for the man screwing up their atmosphere.  Ha!  Fuck it, I always have a good time at those things.  I like to think I will continue with a decent concert schedule for at least a few more years.  Probably until they won't let me in when they see my ID.  They'll probably think I'm a narc.  Probably already do.  Shit, it really doesn't seem  that  long ago when Stevenson, Bob and I were jamming at our first Foo Fighters show at the Riviera, it was.......MY GOD it was over 8 years ago.  1996.  Shit.  That shit was fantastic: getting that nervous, thrilling, spine-tingling feeling when the band that I was watching was up there ripping ass up, and that was my only thought and concern in the world.  It's always been a huge release for me, seeing a rock show with my friends.  Quite drug like.  And now I'm holding on for dear life, hoping that my friends don't drop out before I feel it's time.  But I think that time is approaching, since I have to almost beg most of them to go see a band that I want to see.  Ah, c'est la vie.  It was bound to happen sometime.   But I guess I will just have to enjoy my times at shows that are still to come, while I'm still young.  ROCK AND FUCKING ROLL!!!!!!!!!!!  Good times.
