The winamp volumes are more indicative of the factor of increase in amplitude that is multiplied to the source signal than the amplitude of the output.  This can be observed if you have songs with varying input amplitudes in your playlist.  I normally listen to winamp with a mild volume, but this problem requires me to keep adjusting the volume whenever there is a sudden change in input signal amplitude.  Normally when I work I have the audio play at a very low volume, and the kind of music is slow, classical ones, unless I feel like I'd fall asleep.    Problem :   The play list preference I choose at the start of the day isnt as captivating as it starts out to be. Through the day's progress, the playlist doesnt keep up with the mood changes.   I hear fantasy stories about Bill Gates'  urlLink home  .  Not sure if it will still keep up with all the mood changes though. I will have my MP3's tagged with genre, raaga (if applicable), taala, composer, etc.. and this software should come up with a media library of moods. Nothing like it if the software can analyze the signals and arrive at the mood of the song. The software should come up with an optimal mood-route© so that if i start with a monday morning blue the songs in the playlist should get me back on to the most efficient work-mood.    ps: you can forget about the © for now. If you come across such a product already in the market, let me know I'll seriously consider a change of profession
