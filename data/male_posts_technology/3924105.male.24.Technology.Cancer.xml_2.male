Something about my current situation just doesn't feel right...or perhaps it's several things. Mostly, I'm once again unsure of my future plans. School was concrete, very definite. Then again, I wasn't expecting to land a great IT job either. So now what do I do? School and work? Just work? Just school? There's so much to learn, and my brain is aching for information. The choice seems obvious, yet the money and benefits of full time work is very compelling. Or perhaps this is a time to bust my ass and use this great income to PAY for school while I can.  It seems that neither choice is a recipe for happiness, yet one of them just seems like the right thing to do. Knowing what's the right thing to do, and then actually doing it, are two entirely different things.  I suppose for once, I should listen to myself...
