He has tossed us into a needless war, alienated our allies (Lets hope we don’t need them any time soon), allows American jobs to go over seas, created the largest budget deficit in a long time (where did the surplus go that President Clinton created) and the list goes on and on.   Now, if anyone can give me a good reason not to slam Republicans I will be more than happy to sit down with you and discuss it.  I will also give you a chance to voice your “fair and balanced opinion”.
