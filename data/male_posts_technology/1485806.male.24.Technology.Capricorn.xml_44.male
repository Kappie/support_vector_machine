Fanstastic meal with equally fanstastic people...  When we arrived in Subang Jaya, well we found out that Jeevan and Winnie had a fight and he left home...leaving his poor pregnant , wife alone...our cell leader...So irresponsible..... or is he being a good husband?  Actually in his office before the few days, someone caught measles and therefore he called Winnie to tell her , that he is spending some days from them to avoid her and the unborn baby from getting measles. So Winnie dutifully drops his packed clothes in front of the house and went to the back of the house, while Jeevan collects his clothes...but at the same time ..try to peek thru the house to see his beautiful wife and tried to catch her eyes.  Before the cell came, Winnie was informed by Jeevan to tell the cell that they had a fight and therefore could not stay together any longer. So when we came, she pulled a straight face and told us Jeevan have left her becoz they fought. The rest of us stopped what we are doing and some of our hearts sank...can see so many of our faces dropped...stared at her....but she could not keep her secret long...so she told us about the measles...then we like ...sigh loudly...of relieve.  Had a nice time phoning Jeevan, firstly all of us scolding, rebuking and pleading with him to come back to his wife ...pretending all this time...we have not known about the measles...Jeevan thought that we are really angry with him until later when Jenniffer Tan could not contain her laughter ..and Emillia could not lie so yeah.....hehehehhee  Had a good time chatting with one another and playing a new game introduced by Huay Phing which is called Humz...one day we shall play at Simply United...hehehe  Okay got job training soon, so i'll have to go now...Blog u guys later   Joshua Tan
