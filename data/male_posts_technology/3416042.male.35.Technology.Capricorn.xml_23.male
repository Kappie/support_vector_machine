They want to produce a new miniatures game, but are thinking that writing their own system is too much when there's a perfectly good, licensable system that has a built in fan-base.  Very cool!   I hope that they have their act together with regard to their business proposition, but since I'm going to offer a one time fee for licensing, my income from such a thing will not be tied to their success. Unfortunately, too many ventures in the miniatures business are poorly planned, under-funded and doomed to failure.  There's just not much money in it without a considerable up-front investment that most who venture into the business don't have, me included.   Still, it's very exciting when I get approached about this. It's the fourth time, if I'm recalling correctly, although no one has actually followed through and published.  Perhaps this time will be the time!
