       Chamomile Tea 

    

    

       Uneasy feeling 

       Gurgling 

       Tight throat 

    

     

 

 

 My intestines are gurgling and cramping a little bit.  Could it be the Wheat Thins?  I hope not, I like them and they should be a good source of fiber.  Ah, box says 16 crackers are only 1g of fiber.  There are better sources. Also, although the variety that I ate are low fat, they are still high sodium. 

 Again the tea doens't seem to be making me belch, but I almost wish it would to get rid of this uneasy feeling in my gut. I still feel like eating more, but I probably wont.
