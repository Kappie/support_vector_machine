We talked about it last sunday since they told me nga nag-offer man gani sila nga lagawon kamo. On my part, can you guys at least give me a detailed sched coz like I said medyo busy ako. Indi lang because of the studies, involved man ako for the Orientation Seminar of the incoming freshies so we're quite busy right now getting sponsorships, preparing stuff etc. and i'm also involved with the DORM Orientation Seminar so medyo damo damo mga meetings ko subong and stuff like that. But sige lang a, pray that God will give me a day nga la gid ko ubrahon para malagaw ta. Bantay kamo gali ha, hambal nila kuno may sars na di e. Warnings have been placed all over ADMU about it. Ka tsim tsiok tse. =)  What do you me? How was I sure bout my calling or am i sure kung ma-fulltime ko or part-time. Well i guess i'll answer both nalang. For one thing, sure naman ko nga mafulltime ko. I'm not saying your not just because your going to BSOP. Actually ren, advantage na gani para sa imo kay you can help later generations of youth who think they feel the call of God for full time. =) Mine is actually quite simple. God called me at a quite early age. I'm not so sure bout the age anymore but im sure it was before I was 10. THere was just an overwhelming desire in me to tell people about God. And since bata pa ko at that time, I just accepted it. Being a child, the thoughts of money, career, etc. never crossed my mind pa. =) Now that i'm in college, they do come up from time to time but i just continue to believe that God will provide. =)  He has been for the last 17 years of my life and i really don't think He plans to stop providing any time soon. =)  Bout your standing up sa the edge, yups, i remember it. And you know why I smiled? Because for years, I have been asking God for more people. Not just in the congregation but for more fulltimers. And hey so far, the camps weve been having are raising up more and more full timers. Hehe. =) I guess you could say that even without your knowledge, i was indirectly praying for you, isis, gigi and the others who stood up sa recent camps naton.  Well, daw laba naman ni gani ang akon nga na sulat. Just text me or give a kol when your here na a. I'll be waiting. Dont forget PASALUBONG!!!!! Hehehehehehehe. Bacolod's famous chicken. =) Take Care. GOD BLESS. =)
