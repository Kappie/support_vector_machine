It might be a fun and cool distraction from the fact that over 9 million Americans (including myself) are unemployed, our economy has continuously gone downhill since Bush stole the presidency, and that we are in the middle of a big screw up in Iraq, but it is a poorly thought out, and expesive, publicity stunt.  Go USA!  Since we have so few problems, let's spend time and money on messing up another planet.  The thing that I find the funniest is the way Bush plans to fund it.  He's just cutting funding and jobs from other NASA programs.   In other news, I need everyone's address so I can eventually send out wedding invitations.  It's going to be on August 14th.  The ceremony will be at Maymont and the reception will be at my parents' house.  You should all come.  We're going to have lots and lots of booze.  Oh...and if anyone likes doing hard physical labour and has free time, I've got plenty for you!  Just call me and let me know!
