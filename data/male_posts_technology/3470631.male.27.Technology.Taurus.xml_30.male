Probably just a great excuse to skip out on work - I'm all in support of that, but I think there are also those who show up because there is some part of it that makes them feel better as a person.   I don't mean to get off on a tangent here, but I liken it to those people in High School that would go to that kid's father's funeral -- and they probably had never even spoken to that kid before in their lives. BUT HEY! It's a day off from a school and now that that kid is fatherless let's go support him, even though we woulda never talked to him before in his life!!! WOOHOOO  In conclusion, Reagan was a shitty president with a shitty economic policy and a shitty foreign policy (iran contra, funding bin laden and saddam, ETC)  BUT WHOOOOHOOO he had Alzeimher's let's all SUCK HIS DICK!  I"M SINGLE!!!! LET"S CRUNKED!
