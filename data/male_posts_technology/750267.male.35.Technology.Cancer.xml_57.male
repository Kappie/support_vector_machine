"Yes you are!" Once the fight broke up, I asked each of them if they knew who Monica Lewinsky was. Neither did, of course. But I found it funny.  Last week the same kids were calling each other terrorists. "You're a terrorist." "No, you're one!"  My generation was the MTV generation, I guess if their generation should be called the CNN generation.
