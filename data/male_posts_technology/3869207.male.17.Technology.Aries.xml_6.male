Tyler had his whole life in front of him, and now there's nothing left but an empty shell.  It wasn't his fault, he didn't deserve it, but he's gone.  The worst part is, I don't think he was saved.  I went to classes with him, wrestled side by side with him, I went to his house a few times, but I don't think I ever really witnessed to him.  Sure, I might have made some side comments here and there that could have hinted my beliefs to him, but I never really took it much farther than that.  It doesn't take more than an instant for life to turn upside-down, and leave those still standing with questions and what-if's.  What-if's won't bring him back though, so we need to deal with the what-now's.  So here's to Tyler, the fighter and friend.  I'll miss ya.
