JONNIE!) steals them as he gets ready for a date... to play theres something about Jonnie (unless ur a brit u wont get that joke.. so  urlLink click here ) So now im stuck blowing my goobers into ungodly sand paper like toilet paper and normal tissues... Oh the humanity! Ive been pretending that i wasnt sick (denial never works.. it didnt work for clinton, it wont work for me) It hit me full blast, im reduced to a dribbly old person, even more so than usual.   BAH HUMBUG!
