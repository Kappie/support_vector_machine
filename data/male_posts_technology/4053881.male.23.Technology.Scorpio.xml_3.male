Slowly going there with a fast pace music; I love that commercial, it always makes laugh. It makes me wonder how do they get these kind of ideas and where do they originated from.  Well this week i saw the light of where some of the ideas might come from, the grocery store!!! *dramatic music(dun turn tuh!). As i'm doing my grocery shopping, i wander around like Alice in Wonderland, looking at all the veggies, trying to find all the ingredients for the dish i had planned to cook. Well i go there during the afternoon of a thursday and on friday. I figure, hey people won'T go there, it's frekin' the end of the week and in the middle of the day...no one's going to be there....*aggressive buzzing! WRONG!!!!  Of course as i swiftly drive my cart in the veggies' isle of loblaws, i see an old man, admiring the tomato, choosing and picking them one by one...so i carefully dodge him sweeping right beside him gracefully. But to my surprise, as i pass by him, he decides that he had enough tomato, so without looking in the dead angle, he cuts through. Luckily my driving experience has proven useful as i put the emergency brakes in...i just abruptly stopped walking. To my surprise and shock, minding his own business not caring for the surroundings, the old man did like some bird and flocked off. so, i figure..ok..it happens.  Then, i turn in the isle where the fruits reside. I take my time to pick a couple of fruits, looking around once and a while to see if i was blocking some people....So I start walking towards the bread section. The isles are about 2 and a quarter carts wide, so i take the right "lane" and doze off. Out of nowhere, i see this old woman, walking soooo slowly...i could have stood there and i would have been faster than her..so i figure i would do a lil "speeding" and make it on the left lane....to my utter surprise there was another woman "racing" with her....another slow cart driver...and she took the time to call her husband, then looking at some fruits while blocking the isle :S so as i excuse myself to pass, she starts to yell in a nosy and most obnoxious voice: Woman: Frank!!!! Do you want to peaches! Frank: I don't care, take whatever you want Me: Excuse me, may I pass? Woman: Frank, listen up!?! They look good, but i want to know if I should get some? Frank: Well sure Me: Excu.... Woman interrupting: But it's 0.10$ more per pound...are you sure... Me waving like i'm doing some flag signals to another boat: excuse me Woman: ohh sorry dear, i didn't see you... Walking passed her, i was thinking, what is it with people at the grocery store, they become automatically deaf or is it that their IQ returns to the stone age...They think that it's time to hunt for food, so they they forget their civilized matter and let the food environment take over. I can picture it right now... Some woman: Shhhushhh..i'm picking some apple.... husband: hurry up, i wanna go see the hockey Ga.... Some woman: Shhhh!!!! you'll scare the apples away! shouldn't you be hunting for meat at the butcher's section. Husband: you're right...ahhhh FRESH MEAT!!!! 'VVV' *manly grunt (in case you didn't know 'VVV' is a monster with small eye and big teeth) anyhow, it's like people do it on purpose to block you the way, and get the food before you....and they also start "picking" the veggies individually too...meaning.. ohh let's squeeze and palpate the fruits to see if they are fresh or not...leaving behind the already fresh fruit with some of their marks; as if to mark their territory.  But after finishing in the fruits and veggies section, i went off for the bread and milk section....oh my, it's worst than the old folk's house near my house....there were soo many people from the golden age. In that section, there's also the "buy what's dry in bulk and weight yourself what you buy" section. It's like they don't know what to do there and they're looking at everything as if there's nothing else in the grocery store, clogging up the isles :S Old man: should i get some prune...i like prunes, dried prunes.... other old man: come on, hurry up, i want my dried prunes too! another other old man: can i come too? old woman: hi, i'm going to bake some cookies for my grandson, ...blablabla..until someone falls asleep.  So as i ferociously swoop through the dangerous isle and dodging all the carts and unidentifed and wandering kids following their parents without looking, I fall in the meat and the rest section....It's interesting how people take their time at choosing what to buy. I clearly see what are in men or women's head when is ee them grocery shopping for cans... -Should i take President's Choice Chicken and noodle soup, or campbell? -I know, let's take the cart, leave it in the middle of the isle, maybe it'll make us think clearly on which brand to take...we can then calculate the optimum price/quality -ok let's go about 5-10 feet away from the cart and pretend we're looking...ohh look someone is approaching from afar... -mehh it's ok...he'll just go away if we ignore him.... As I approach..i see the woman noticing me, then quickly looking at her cans the way Indiana Jones does when he tries to substitute a bag of sand with the hard seeked treasure that the can is....Did I forget to mention that Loblaws always put the price ratio per gram on each price label so to make it easier to compare....Again, I was upset.  Then I went to ask for some grennadine to make some drinks....But i couldn't find it..so I asked a clerk...the service at Loblaws is quite excellent, almost to say that they'll take you by the hand to what you are looking for..So the woman start going through 3 different isles, then asks another clerk, and another...calls on the phone for the "guy" who's supposedly taking care of that section...so i figure yeah it's quite possible...after 15 minutes..we actually find the grennadine and I put the bottle where the seat for the baby is on the cart. She then goes to me: Clerk: You know, i knew where it was, i just wasn't sure of which isle it was at...oh and by the way, if you want a trick for next time, put the bottle inside the cart...cause most people always drop the bottle through the opening for the baby's leg... me: Yeah...i'll do that next time... It's funny how some people try to offer you help you when all you want is to go away. I was finally able to pay and go home after that... You know, i'm pretty sure that the people that owns grocery shops or those "marketing researcher" know about this, but it's all a big mastermind scheme to make you spend more time in store...if they could..they would probably put some barricade and tell you they'Re renovating. I'm sure they scrutinizingly observe people's behavior and do like comedians...only to make you spend more time, hence give them more chance of you buying something in store.
