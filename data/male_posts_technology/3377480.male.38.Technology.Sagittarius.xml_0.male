He went from west texas to santa fe new mexcico last weekend, to one of my sisters college graduations, his transmision in his 50k denale got sick and died, he had to rent a car to get home, local gm dealership "fixs' transmision, he drive the 7 hours back there today, get car, gets 4 hours away and stops to check, and fluid in trany is low, takes to local dealership they freak, say that the gm dealership didnt fix what was truly wrong, but tell him to stop and put fluid in every hour or so and he can make it home.  at that points is when i talk to him.  He is pissed.  wellll it just got worse for him  he calls me at the house a hour half later, and i cant hardly hear him for some god awful racket.  he is driving in a fricken hail storm!  In his beloved Denale, that fng GM did not fix correctly anyway, and he is now in the middle of bumb fricken new mexico that is flater than a driveway with no place to hide!  with a truck that is still fd up!  I made myself another drink and drank it for him!
