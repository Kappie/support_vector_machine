It's a show in the same vein as Curb Your Enthusiasm - and all of the Christopher Guest movies (Spinal Tap, Waiting for Guffman, etc) and it's pure genius. They filmed 2 seasons of it - and I think both are out now on DVD (or Season 2 is coming soon).   David Brent is the best character since George Costanza (probably better actually). Seriously - go out tonight and rent Season 1. You won't be let down.  Other than that, I'm back on the Sox wagon for a pivotal series with the A's. Huge.   Also, I am off the older women train. Horrible idea-- just horrible. I'm back to 19 year oldsalkfdj; TIGHT IS RIGHT.   Always be repping...
