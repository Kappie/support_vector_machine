Perhaps you have forgotten what Netscape was really like back then.  In my experience, Netscape was not a customer-friendly organization. They were always more concerned with being able to say "our application runs on 16 different operating systems, including 12 versions of Unix" than to say that their application worked well in any of them or worked consistently across all platforms.  Case in point: - In 1996, I was working for one of Netscape's largest customers (40,000+ licenses of Navigator); Netscape even distributed a press release to announce the deal they signed with my employer - During this period, I was developing what the Netscape salesman at the time called the most complex web-based application in Canada - Netscape 2.0 would crash after showing 10 web pages from my application (can you say memory leak?). I had to change the way I was storing data from a client side approach to a server side approach to "lessen" the impact of the memory leak, but the leak was still there. - Netscape 2.0 had one particular HTML problem that I couldn't get around. I called Netscape support for help, and their response floored me. "We agree that this is a bug, but it's probably too late to fix it for the 3.0 release. It will probably be fixed when Navigator 4.0 comes out."  - To put this into perspective, my employer takes six months to test, certify and roll out new software to their employee's desktops. Even if 4.0 was released in 12 months, it wouldn't be available to my users for 18 months, so waiting until Navigator 4.0 was not an option for me. - In comparison, Microsoft treated their developers much better. I can remember getting Microsoft Support in Redmond looking into a particular IE bug, and getting to talk several times with an actual IE engineer (as opposed to a non-technical call center) who sent me a patch for my problem. It was resolved in less than a week. And MSDN has always been an amazing source of developer info.  IE surpassed Netscape in quality in its 3.0 release. Netscape has never been able to regain the lead in terms of a quality Windows product since then. If you ask me, Netscape's death should be ruled a suicide, by trying to charge money for a poorer quality product. To some extent, you can't compete with free. But you certainly can't compete if the browser you're charging money for just plain sucks compared to the free one.  Now the real question is, what would the Internet be like without Microsoft's innovations with IE? "Boring, buggy, and not useful for entertainment or e-commerce" is the answer to that one.
