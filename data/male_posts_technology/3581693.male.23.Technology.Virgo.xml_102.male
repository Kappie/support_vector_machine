Made it nice an pretty lots of colour - go to print it and there's like 9 jobs in the queue ahead of me - all belonging to C Smith (she's a web admin, she is also wheelchair bound) - and as I'm sure you know, colour laser printers aren't the fastest machines.   So using my technical know how - I go into the queue (I have administrative rights on all printers) - I set the priority of my job to 99 (the highest - the default is 1). So I watch the queue to see how it works (this is my first time - I'm very excited) - sure enough as soon as the current job is cleared from the queue my job gets sent to the printer.   I stroll up to the printer - who do I find there, C Smith - waiting for her billion print jobs to come out. She says to me - "oh this is going to a while" - I swear she said it with attitude too.   I watched a couple of pages come out - all hers... and then bam - my two pages come out... she grabs them - "Oh - what's this?" - she was so shocked... I said - "oh those are mine" Big smile on my face...the crippled bitchwas baffled - I could tell she was thinkin' "how could this be - I sent a billion jobs - I saw them all in the queue".   I ran away with an evil laugh... muhahahahahahahahahahaha!    Ok - I didn't really do that  - but I thought about it... and it was definitely funny - I got a good chuckle out of it.
