Voting here on the Blog has little meaning, and results in an endless Tastes Great / Less Filling loop.  Though I am amused at the panic inspired by the possibility that I might vote for Bush.  In fact, the panic was so delighful that now I won't say anything more about it at all, just so I can enjoy the chaos.
