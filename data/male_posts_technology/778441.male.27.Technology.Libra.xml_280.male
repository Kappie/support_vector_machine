Arindam Banerjee, an alumnus of Indian Institue of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur and now working for Telstra in Melbourne made this contention in his book, "To The Stars!".  For those who do not know Newton's First Law of Motion, it says, " Every object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that state of motion unless an external force is applied to it. ". This is also sometimes referred to as the "Law of Inertia". Using his unconventional theory, Banerjee has described in a technical paper, what he calls, a design for 'perpetual motion machines' which can generate energy without burning any kind of fossil fuel or any radioactive process.  The Internal Force Engine, which Banerjee has designed, never runs out of power because it is 'self charging' without the need for any external source of energy.
