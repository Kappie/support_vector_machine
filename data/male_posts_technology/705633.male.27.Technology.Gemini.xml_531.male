We went to the awesome Darwin Centre at the  urlLink Natural History Museum . The Darwin Centre is a huge collection of creatures and plants from all around the world, all dead and bobbing around in jars of formaldehyde.  It rocks, cheaper than a Zoo and the animals can't hid away in the corner of the cage so you can't see them. They just kind of bob around in the ether, looking all dead and stuff. They had a giant barracuda that washed up in Cornwall, loads of other fish, even a dolphin and some primates and stuff. It was very weird, kind of like in  Independence Day  when they show off the dead alien bodies in the jars.  Here are a few random thoughts on London:  London is big and busy. Obviously, as it is a city. But I just thought I'd mention it. Homeless people crash in doorways. Sometimes I wondered, if one of them had died how long it would take before anyone noticed. Sushi rules! I always miss the stars at night when I'm in London. Light pollution sucks. I'm sure the tube is bad for you. I always want to take a shower when I get off it. Like Agent Smith, I feel saturated by it's grimey grimness.  While I'm at it, here's my answers to this quiz that's doing the rounds..  1) How would you finish this phrase "I have never been so embarrassed as the time when......."?  I got stripped naked in the O bar on my 21st birthday. It was full. I was on stage. 'nuff said.  2) If you could have any job in the world what would it be?  International Playboy and Jetsetter, getting paid loads for doing pretty much nothing. Can I have a big yatch and a lear jet too. Are they here yet?  3) What do you like best about each guy on toaster files?  Grist - Sense of humor. Reduces me to giggles. Sexual deviant. Custard - Geezer. A bit ohh, a bit wa-hey. Baity - Fun trying to set him up all the time. I will keep embarrassing him till he does it himself. Alex - He's like... Omnipotent or something. He's just there. Brett - Mad as a fish. Scott - Just as bad. No, worse in fact.  Kirk - How can anyone be such a player yet so down to earth? Kirk rocks :D  4) If you could have anyone as your lover who would it be?  The girl I have right now. 8)  5) What is your absolute favorite meal of all time?  Hmm.. Something like garlic chilli chicken, or a uber strength Thai green curry with a pitcher of Kokanne beer. Yay!
