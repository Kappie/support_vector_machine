 My second day at the new job.  I ate more than yesterday, but still not enough.  I'm trying to make up for it at home each night though.  It's difficult. 

 I'm not going to go into detail with the descriptions today, but the hidden xml in this post has all the information.  I try to post only the necessary data while at work.  I may be forced to forego this blog in favor of a more concice format...which means a lot of coding on my own site. 

 Ah well.  That is what I chose to do with my life.
