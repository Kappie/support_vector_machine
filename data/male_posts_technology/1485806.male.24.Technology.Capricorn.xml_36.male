Somehow i found out that she had the same idea on how to get Christmas presents for everyone. Actually we talked about it before...  Back to the story...on Christmas...I have given out most of my presents to everyone and receives presents from those i have not given presents to...how ironic huh? oh well Praise God for cell leader(s) from both cell Pure JOy and Simply United.  Then later had lunch with an effort to join the Pure JOy cell. My intentions was to introduce the Pure Joy members to Simply United...one of the first step to get Pure Joy to adopt the Simply United people. i mean the members needed someone to look up to and get advices from. Yes Simply United was once adopted by the family cell...but so far nothing have happened. and because i know Pure jOy quite well...so... It was a great time makaning in banana leaf with the cells...but of course...a bit dissapointed..Simply United moved away from Pure jOy and makan with Sheep United...BTW...these names are cell name ..  Later in the evening, Had a good time makaning(again)  in Wai Nyan's house...since i am regular there...i treat it just like my own home and yeah the family is the closest to my heart. Having dinner with Jacob's ladder 's pot luck was a great blessing ...cause coming from a non christian family ...having a dinner like this is like a prophecy of sorts....that soon i can have the same dinner experience with my family. We makan pasta, chicken , ice cream and tempoyak...(fermented durian which i missed out while i was charging for ice-cream) . ...stayed there with the intention of staying overnight but did not work out cause too sleepy.  I started work the next morning...and since my training is almost over., i 've found out that my job is quite relaxing , monitoring critical servers, an important job, a boring job cause of its repetitiveness...but overall you get to learn something everyday. Since the internet connection is kinda strong , i get to connect my trusty laptop in there and watched broadband tv all around the world...  Currently i am watching 3 ABN ( 3 Angels Broadcast Network) ,. a christian channel network ....currently showing a seminar of Revelation which is quite good and solid...that is interdenominational.... opps got to focus...gotta get my bible....hehe  :)
