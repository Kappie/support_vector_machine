The event is held in parallel with  urlLink Feria del Toro  (the Bullfighting Fair); the run itself seems to be in the interests of transporting the bulls to the fair while getting them good and  urlLink angry, confused, scared and weakened  in the process. Being that the event is in honor of  urlLink Saint Fermín , when the  urlLink San Fermín  church strikes 8am, the bulls are released and the runners get underway, trying to avoid them on their  urlLink just under 1km trip . On arrival at the Plaza del Toro (Bullring) they are herded into corrals and later released so the crowd can watch the matadors kill them in traditional bullfighting fashion  [ urlLink 380k  |  urlLink 150k  |  urlLink 56k ] . Of course, many people are  urlLink not really so keen  on this event; and it seems  urlLink PETA  will be holding one of their typically  urlLink daft protests .  Can't people just  urlLink throw tomatoes at each other  or something?   Photo from the  urlLink San Fermín website .
