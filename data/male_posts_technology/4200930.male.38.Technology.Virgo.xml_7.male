That ‘children’ are staying with their parents and being supported by them for longer. Way to go brainiacs surely that survey cost thousands and netted a nice profit for the survey company.  It’s painfully obvious why this state of affairs should come to pass if the Government just sat down and thought about it. But would they worry their tiny heads about it – clue: your probably sat on your head right now Tony! Your lot talk out of it enough!  Lets examine the facts:  No grants for students, they have to pay fees  Housing costs are really high, with runaway house prices and rents.  Low paid jobs, employers keeping costs down and paying ‘piss poor’ wages  This service culture we seem to have and no manufacturing industry, with call centres being the modern day equivalent of the mill.   So before more politicians start off on ‘kids’ staying at home and being ‘lazy’ etc can they just for one moment look at what’s happening and then make judgements rather than just making an un-educated guess. I will however agree that the society in which we live has ‘forced’ many kids and young adults into not expecting much from their lives.  Employers have a duty also to ensure that people are paid well so that they can contribute to society and consume the goods and services, which sustains the economy. It appears the only well paid people in many companies are the senior managers, if you rise through the ranks, certainly the company I work for just takes the piss with your wages.  A little tip for the Government: Rising costs are also why the population is decreasing in this country as both parties are required to go to work in order to keep the mortgage paid along with ever increasing household bills.  Talk about RIP OFF BRITAIN, why on earth asylum seekers want to come and live here beats me. Oh sorry I forgot I’m paying for them with my taxes and we do live in a welfare state!!!!
