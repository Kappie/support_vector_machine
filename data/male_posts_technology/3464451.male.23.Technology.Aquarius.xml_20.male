I have become manager for a week because my boss left on vacation.  I was absolutely swamped after about lunch time that I didn't even get to go to lunch so I just left work early....  I have a feeling this week is going to be crazy!!!  I have been playing this new game called Sacred...  it seems really cool and I love rpg's so yes, I am a gamer, just not online and not all the time...  I find time to do other things that I want to do!!!  I went walking with some friends today and we went to the park and just hung out.  today was overall!!!  a good day!  I was pleased, other then the nathan sleep I got last night!!!   nathan = nothing/none/no so, now I am hungry and I have to take my pills for the night so I can fully get over this sickness..  I almost there though, just a couple of more days of medicine and I will be done!! well take care.....:)
