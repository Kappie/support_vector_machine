Holding the posessions we have in such high honor, rather than understanding that they're not that important, they're things God has blessed us with. I've noticed in my life I tend to do this a bit, but not really that much. I'm pretty content with what I have, I think it comes from not really having that much. Sure, there are things that I would like, but really I'm content with what I have and I don't try to get them very much, and if I do and they're taken away, I'm upset for a bit but get over it (IE: Guitar that I don't get back till next month). However I notice just how much Americans as a whole are materialistic. Wealth and levels of achievement really all depend on how much you have, what you have, and how much it's "worth" (how you can put a worth on things that aren't important is beyond me). Americans seem to think that the way to happiness is through things... that's why if you notice, when Americans go overseas they try to give the people things in hopes that it will make them happier.  Just something I'm pondering.
