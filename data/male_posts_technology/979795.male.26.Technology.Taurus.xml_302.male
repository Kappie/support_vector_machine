Apart from the obvious stuff I changed, I have really no idea what is wrong with it that I couldn't get them to go online. But this has been draggin on so long now. I'm very sian of doing this shitz now. I hate maintaining PCs. I don't mind doing it when it's needed but not setting up stuff and new technologies. Think everyone is kinda taking this for granted now. If I can only find a permanent fulltime job, I'll definitely refuse anymore of this requests.  I got home soon after. My dad wanted to view a TIF document. Simple question which lead to a whole big arguement which lead to a lot of hollering, shoving and throwing of stuff. I didn't help matters by the tone in which I replied him. Neither did he want to listen when he's at the peak of his temper. Got a chair thrown out of my room (damage to the floor, nothing to the chair). During all the shoving around, my mom knowing that I had a bit of sore eye on my right eye tried to stand between the both of us to protect me. In her frustration she grabbed the nearest object to throw on the ground. Bad mistake, turned out it was a $3000 piece of engineering equipment my dad had loaned from his principal co. in Australia. Shitz ... I guess we don't have to pay it back anytime soon coz it's on long term loan but still ... ~$~  I let him get to me again. I find it so hard to shield out the comments coming from my family unlike those coming from an outsider. Each of us had a part in the way things got out of hand. It's a frustrating moment. Things cooled off pretty quick but I still find it really irksome to spend time at home rather than in camp. I'm considering spending time in camp even when I'm on leave. No point coming back and making things so difficult on everyone right?
