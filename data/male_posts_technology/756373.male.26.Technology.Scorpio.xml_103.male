I was speaking to my stepdad yesterday after watching the Carte Blanche interview with Eugene Terreblanche, and I commented, "Well, he says he's found God". My stepdad replied : "He said he'd found  his  God." The difference is like black to white. (haha.)  His comments that SA is no democracy, rankled. South Africa's commitment to peace, stability and fair play resulted in him walking free today. He was in for a lousy 3 years as an enemy of the state. Mandela was in for what - 30?  He's still a dangerous man. Hitler proved that all a radical minority needs to seize power is the fiery rhetoric they need to 'kry gas'. Maybe it isn't likely that Terrebblanche has the resources and charisma needed, but he seems to have the determination and drive. And he has  his  God...
