It was quite eerie walking to work at about 5 to 10 - the first time I've seen clear roads and therefore no sound excepta fewfireworks going off from various back gardens, every visible front room telly showing the same glowing red scoreboard...      OK, here's the final version of the Eurovision Drinking Game (a mix of my own ideas and a fewthings going around on current emails)...A possibility for the big 50th... Although this'll be knackered if the new voting system carries on the way it's been going!      RULES OF THE GAME      Take a drink for every:   1. Performer who resembles someone you know 2. Performer who resembles a famous person 3. Example of visible/prominent nipples/genitalia 4. Foreign act that sings in English (and fails) 5. Song that goes up half an octave in the last refrain 6. Politically-related effect during the song 7. Brother/sister or family act 8. Giveaway that Tezza isonto his third bottle of wine(this is inevitable, just wait for the first slur or slip of the tongue and get pouring!) 9. Ceefax/teletext subtitle that just gives up and says "Music", "Hums","And so on..."or "Etc"   10. Female presenter dress change (2 if the male presenter changes outfit, 3 if it's just for the voting).      Give each Country a mark out of ten for the following and take a drink every time anyone scores 7 or over on any category:   1.Use of feathers 2.Use of Sequins 3.Use of Dwarfs 4.Possibility of any representative appearing in an internet sex video 5.'La la la-ing', 'ooh babying' and humming 6. Use of mime in order to convey meaning of lyrics sung in unfathomable accent or foreign language 7.Likelihood ofsong being made into a 'hi-energy' version and played in every gay bar in Gran Canaria every summer for the next 7 years 8. Key Changes and sing along chorus potential 9. Likelihood of record being bought by grandmothers 10. Likelihood of record being bought by 8 year old girls 11. Likelihood of record being bought by gay men 12. References to War in Iraq, environmental issues, plight of the third world or other 'serious things' 13. Nil Point potential (If any country manages a perfect ten in 6    or more categories, finish the damn bottle. Every following act will be crap by comparison unless you're completely pissed, especially if France have already been on!)      The Speciality/Voting Rules   Take a drink if:      ISRAEL: Give Germany 0 pts   NETHERLANDS: Have words in the song title that make no sense in any language   UNITED KINGDOM: Give France any points   ESTONIA: Gain less than 20 points   FRANCE: Give the UK any pts   ROMANIA: Are wearing citrus colours   MALTA: Finish in the top 3   NORWAY: Scandinavian rules apply: If they give another Scand. country 12 pts,or if they give NO pts to any other Scand. country   RUSSIA: The leader of the jury has a beard   BELGIUM: Have a non-Belgian singer   CYPRUS: Give Turkey 0 pts   ICELAND: Scandinavian rules apply   SPAIN:Wear lurid vomit-esquecolours   DENMARK: Scandinavian rules apply   GERMANY: Give Israel 8/10/12 pt   SWITZERLAND: Vote in a particularlyinteresting/unexpectedmanner (actually, if this happens, pour a drink andstagger round to that next door neighbour you've never spoken to and offer it to them in celebration!)   CROATIA: Give Macedonia 10/12 Pts   SWEDEN: Scandinavian rules apply   FYR MACEDONIA: Give Croatia 10/12 pts   FINLAND: Scandinavian rules apply.   LATVIA: Gain +100 pts   TURKEY: Give Cyprus any pts   IRELAND: Their act is a solo artist (2 drinks if they're singing a ballad, 3 if they're sat on a stool while they sing)   AUSTRIA:Singer/s slap their thigh while bearing demonic grin during a performance      AT ANY TIME: If the lead singer is attractive and receives 8+ pts despite the song being crap (stick to this rule if you really just want to get horribly drunk!)...      ...Fun for every alcoholic next time round then! I suppose you could replace alcohol with cigarettes or Ferrero Roche or something. Depends on your budget or ability (stamina) to watch Eurovision sober I guess...      		    urlLink    Yahoo!
