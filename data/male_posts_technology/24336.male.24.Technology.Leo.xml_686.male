My first thought was, Walmart with an online service, up against a formidable opponent like iTunes Music Store?  Then again, people thought the same thing about Microsoft coming out with the XBox to go against Sony and the PS2.  Anyway, this serivce, much like the new Napster, uses WMA 9.  Because of this, no one with a Mac can use this service and this is even mentioned in their  urlLink FAQ .  Oddly enough, 

 urlLink this page  has a screen shot from a Mac!  Observed first by a  urlLink Slashdot member .
