Apparently she had just gotten home or back to the Hotel from a busy day at the beach.  She told me the water was cold there and then asked mommy to make sure it was cold and mommy told her it was not so instantly Karissa changed her story to the water was warm.  She told me how she played in the sand and built sand castles and swam in the water with mommy.  She talked about how the waves crash down and get in her mouth and stuff.  Karissa asked me a bunch of stuff about my work like what is it's name where is it stuff like that.  She told me how work is not just for boys but it is for girls too!   Maybe she should explain that one to her mommy!   Karissa started to laugh and I told her how much I liked her laugh and how cute it was. That made her laugh more and of course she had to tell mommy about it.  Then she said I don't want to talk anymore and that was the end of it.  She asked me to call her later and I said how about I call you tomorrow and if you are not there I leave you a voicemail.  She liked that idea telling her mommy (in an excited voice) how she would get a voicemail if they are not there.   I gave her hugs and kisses first and she returned the gesture and that was that.  When I hear her laughing and sounding so happy it really plays on me like what I am doing in my effort to get custody of her is wrong but if I don't do anything I feel I am wrong as well.  I just cannot sit back and do nothing.  If I lose that is one thing but if I do nothing that is entirely different.  If I lose I keep all the paperwork and receipts and when she is old enough to choose I show her that daddy tried.  I just hope I don't have to do that.   I have to admit having   SFW   is making me a little paranoid.  Especially now that she has been served yet again.    I saw some pics of Jeremey today all Decked out like a biker boy!  He looked like he was having fun.    Other then that I get to look forward to a day of house cleaning and yard work tomorrow as I cannot afford to do much else.  Oh well the house needs it and it keeps me out of trouble.  Good thing it is free HBO, Cinemax weekend on the Dish!
