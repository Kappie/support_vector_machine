Custard is off snowboarding in Italy, Baity is in Guernsey for the weekend killing orcs, Dougal is busy doing something I don't know if I’m allowed to talk about, Danger is busy moving into his new gaff, Grist is.. well, nowhere to be seen.. I decided to try and watch a "proper" movie for a change. No explosions, big breasted girls in tight tops etc.. Gosford Park, a period murder mystery drama thing. A friend had seen it and said it was awesome, so I thought I’d give it a go.. and it sucks ass. A third of the way in, people are still busy talking about Lady Vage's new model A Ford or some shit, an old guy gets stabbed and Stephen fucking Fry turns up as the police inspector. That's the straw that broke that camel's back, that is.   I think I’m going to head into town and buy a playstation 2 and Vice City. I heard you can KO prostitutes and nick their money in it. Now that's my definition of high-brow entertainment.
