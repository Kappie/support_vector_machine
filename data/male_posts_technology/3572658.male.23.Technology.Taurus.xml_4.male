My reasons are that I would possibly be in school for 5 more years, then I would have to do like a two year internship, then probably a two year apprenticeship, then if I am lucky I would get in with a really neat firm and maybe in a three or four years then I could design some really impressive buildings! So if I started that now, at 23, maybe by the time I am 35 I could do what I really wanted to do with architecture!   Realistically tho, Andrew and I are thinking about starting our own business(es)! More later maybe sooner!
