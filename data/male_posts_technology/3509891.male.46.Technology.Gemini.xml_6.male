I have been taking classes at the University of Minnesota for the last 27 years, and I am finally a year away from graduating.  Needless to say, I am not one of the types of students that they are proud of.  In fact, in an effort to send a wake-up call to us slow-pokes, they have set a deadline, after which, to graduate, we would need to meet current requirements (instead of the requirements set when we enrolled, and which we have been working toward).  So in the intrest of finishing up as soon as possible (with a year to spare), I am taking a correspondents course over the summer.  My first assignment involves comparing a number of creation myths.  I have an idea of what I want to say, and have plotted out about half of the paper.  The main problem is forcing myself to sit down and write it.  That is where this blog comes in.  I figure if I can get myself to sit at the computer and write for this blog, I can work-out my thoughts, and continue on with the paper.  Next is my computer programming.  I have been working as a computer programmer for 19 years, and I have found that it is VERY important to keep up to date with the new technologies.  Therefore, I am trying to teach myself C# and ASP.NET.  First, the C#.  I have a little pet project that I first wrote in Delphi, and I have decided to start over from scratch and rewrite it in C#.  In Delphi it is a card game named Sevens, or SevenUp (I have it available for download on my web page).  In C#, I want to create a Cards development class library, to make it easier to create any card game.  I have most of the programming done for the card classes, but have yet to create the rules class.  Another program that I would like to write is a library book management program.  I would like to query the local library for information on a book using the barcode on the book.  No real great challenges there, just trying to find the time.  And finally, my novel.  I have a couple of ideas for books, and I made the mistake of telling one of them to a coworker of mine.  She fell in love with it, and wants me to write it, so she can read it.  And then, to make matters worse, she gave me an idea for another book.  And so I need to spend time on this as well.  Although my genre of choice is science fiction, this book is more of a spy thriller, involving a stollen PC, with sensitive information on it, a terrorist plot, and an innocent bystander who can't seem to shake the people tracking him.  I have been able to start work on the book, but I am not a writer yet, and I still don't know how to write dialog.  At some time, I will make the plunge and start.  At that time, I will bring a sample to my friend, and she will be able to critique it for me.  So what's stopping me.  Again, maybe this blog will help me.  We'll see.
