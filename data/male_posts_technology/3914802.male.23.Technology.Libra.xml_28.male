I don't really see her online anymore and it is kind of strange. I just want to see how her job is going, make sure she is cool and stuff. I hope nothing I did managed to scare her off (maybe I grabbed her boobie the wrong way or something). I do assume that she is looking for a new place since she told me that she was a little while back. Apparently her roommates aren't that nice. It is hard to deal with new people sometimes when you move in from Ohio like she did. I would call her but I don't even think it is something serious. She can take care of herself. Oh well, I guess maybe she has found a new place in DC or something (she was in VA before). I am not sure that she has her own computer, and I don't know if she would be the type to just go out and get a new one and some internet provider, like me. Of course, I need the internet and its great store of knowledge. Well... that and I need it to take my classes. Speaking of which, the semester is almost over for the summer and my final is coming up. Oh boy! I get to draw diagrams and explain the finer points of systems engineering. I get an in person class next semester. I think that as long as I can make it there on time then I will be a-ok. In person ones are much easier to discipline yourself in. The point is that, if I don't read for this in person class I will feel like an idiot when I attend it, kind of like a motivator ya know. Anyways, I gotz ta get my rent paid today, and that is all the way in Cleveland Park :-( One Hour! just to metro out (from work) and get my rent paid. I have a pair of very nice supervisor and project manager that let me do this since my lunch break is only supposed to be 30 minutes. I am not getting very many calls this morning anyways.
