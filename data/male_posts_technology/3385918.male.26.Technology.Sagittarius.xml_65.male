Show was pretty good, even thought I feel asleep several times during it. Not that it was  boring, even thought most of the stuff that was shown was recycled material. Most new fans won't notice, but older fans will. I think that the WWE is trying all this old stuff so that they can real in the new fans like they did the old fans. But most of this stuff isn't as effective now as it was before. So, the new fans don't care and the old fans feel cheated for getting the same crap over and over again. A shit, by any other name, still smells the same.   Show starts with Evolution calling out Eugene. Eugene pops up and HHH, to the shock and horror of the other members of Evolution, makes him an honorary member of the stable. Of course, we all know this is bullshit cause The Game is evil and all.   William Regal comes out to confront HHH and reveal his dastardly plot to cloud Eugene's mind, but is meet with accusations when The Game reveals that Regal originally took the job of looking after Eugene in exchange for receiving his job back as a wrestler. Also, HHH reminds Regal that at first, one of the conditions for the job was that he make Eugene fail.   Regal tries to explain, but HHH convinces him otherwise. Now, Eugene is confused. Oh, the drama !!!  Anyway, Eric comes out and makes a match between HHH and Regal with Eugene as guess referee.   Don't know where all this is going, but it's looking pretty good and interesting.   We get out first match: Jericho and Edge VS Batista and Randy Orton. Yes, it's the same match as last week, except that this week Jericho managed to finish the match in one piece. The good guys win in a better structured match than last week's. Of course, that isn't saying much since Jericho was knocked out several minutes into the match and it became a handicap match.   I must say that Batista has improved in the ring and is looking really good.   Next we have, if I remember correctly, more Lita sobbing about screwing Kain. I guess Lita and Kain never heard of a little thing called a condom. Stacy is in the segment, but nobody cares.   Funny how the net reports that the WWE writers don't even know where this segment is going. Like you couldn't tell...  We get another segment with Ric Flair confronting HHH about letting Eugene enter Evolution and HHH admitting that this is all a ploy to use Eugene and, in the process, destroy him.   I hate to say this, but HHH is finally growing on me as a villain. Before, he just seemed annoying. Now, he seems fresh and new. Looks better too. Also, his matches have improved. This is mostly because he has started to sell other people's moves and actually make the young talent look good. I think that HHH doesn't have anything else to prove. Using backstage politics, he's molded himself as one of the greatest wrestlers in the history of the WWE. Did he win this honor? No, he cheated and used his influence (fucking the bosses daughter helps with things like this) to reach the top and stay there. In the process, he's buried the reputation of Kain, RVD, Booker T and Scott Steiner (of course, this isn't saying much).   At least now, he is putting over people and actually making them look good. This is the HHH people want to see. Too bad that it was at the expense of other people.   We get the Regal VS HHH match, which was short, but I liked very much. Regal has always done well in the ring, but before his injury he looked like he was going through the motions, almost sleepwalking, when he fought in the ring. Before he came back, he promised more energy and determination. I guess he knows that this could very well be his final run before his health collapses. And, by the looks of it, he is going the distance this time around. He seems stronger, agile and more determined.   I liked what I saw in this match. Regal looked pretty good for a man his age. Very convincing too. Then again, the new HHH is doing wonders now for the talent. So, both put on a decent, short match that showed a lot of promise in the newly returning Regal. Like I've said before, I would love to see a real match between William Regal and Ric Flair.   But when I say real match, I mean no Evolution interference, nor a short time limit for the match. At least 15 to 20 minutes of old school chain wrestling and Ric Flair being the dirties player in the game. I am sure that real wrestling fans will find much to like here.  Match ends in a DQ as Eugene spots Regal with some brace knuckles that Ric Flair threw to HHH, but Regal intercepted. Eugene is very disappointed in Regal (Lita should take acting classes from this guy! Oscar! Oscar!). HHH pushes Regal into Eugene, which results in Eugene going mental on Regal. HHH and Ric Flair laugh as they taunt Regal and drag an out of control Eugene backstage, while remarking that Regal had in coming. Regal looks on with anger.  This, my friends, is drama. I like it very much, even though, like the Lita angle, I have a feeling that the writers don't have a clue of where they are going with this. Still, it's turning out pretty well. Eugene is angry at Regal and doesn't realize that HHH is just using him. It's like a tragedy in the way HHH is setting up Eugene for his downfall. Interesting stuff. Might actually work in attracting interest in the wrestling product.   After this I don't recall what we got since I dosed off several times. I don't recall seeing Trish or Tomko or even Victoria, which is odd considering that we had a guy in drag save Victoria from Tomko and Trish last week and then... nothing. This is what I hate about not planning stuff correctly. They can't follow through and it seems like stuff happens for no apparent reason. We've had several of those many times. It hurts the WWE's credibility.  We get a match with La Resistance VS two people who I was starting to think where currently not working for the WWE. One is Rhyno, whose had shit since moving to RAW and, of all people, Sgt. Slaughter, looking better in this match that in other matches he's had to participate in. Of course I know Slaughter is working in the WWE as a...erm... something. But it was good seeing him out there doing what he does best and, actually, looking pretty good (even though it's not really wrestling, but putting on a show). La Resistance wins with their little seen, but cool finishing move, which makes you wonder what the hell is going to happen to Rhyno.  The previous match also makes you wonder if The Hurricane and Rosey had the night off since they always end up fighting these guys. Maybe the WWE finally realized that they can't keep giving fans the same shit over and over again and expect them to stick around for more. Na, I doubt it. Still, it was good seeing something different. Of course, if the WWE had real tag teams on RAW  Okay, I think we had an interview with Kain where Matt Hardy ran in and try to beat Kain, only to be dragged away by security. *Yawn*  Oh, Eric comes out and anounces that tonight will be a stipulation match and that in order for Benoit to win against Kain, he would have to force Kain to submit. Kain, on the other hand, could win by pin fall, count out, submition or DQ, making Benoit's chance of winning very slim.  By this time, my mom turned of the chanel and went to sleep. She thought that this sucked cause she hates Kain and feels like all this crap leads to bad wrestling. She is right about this, even though Benoit's match with Kain later in the program was a solid wrestling match filled with high drama and action.  Now that I thi8nk of it, I think this was before the Regal VS HHH match, which means she also missed that too. This is why the WWE has to rethink it's stratergy cause people eventually loose interest when they see the same type of crap over and over again.  Still, like I said, Kain and Benoit put in a solid match that was worth waitting till the end of the program to see. This is what people want. The match was well structured. There was a lot of suspence since Benoit had gotten wins on Kain before, but never submitions. Giving Kain, a huge savage wrestler, an advantage in this match against Benoit raises the stakes and makes the match seem bigger and more important that it really is. Probably one of the better encounters in recent months.  Benoit gets a submition and the crowd goes wild. Then Kain knocks Benoit and is ready to break him appart when Lita gets into the ring. The loud crowd suddenly goes silent. HAHAHAHA  Lita tries to trick Kain and manages to kick him in the groin, but Kain grabs her by the neck and it ready to chock slam her when he remembers that Lita is carrying his baby. He backs off and the storyline that will not die continues.   I wonder what will happen when it's time for Lita, who isn't pregnant in real life, to give birth. Maybe they can do an Alien - The Fly birth with an ugly Kain-like baby popping up and scaring the shit out of people. I wouldn't be surprised if the WWE did something like that.  Which reminds me of the Great American Bash, Smackdown's newest pay per view event. It happend on sunday. Didn't see it, but like I've said, I never order pay per views. I just read the results and reaction and then I decide if I will buy the DVD or not when it comes out.  Based on the reaction of the PPV, this DVD I will not buy unless I go crazy or become like the real Eugene... retarded. It was a horrible card. Everyone knew it. The outcome of the matches were just as bad. In fact, the only real good match was the Chavo Guerrero VS Rey Mysterio match. They've has hundreds of these matches in the WWE. I think that they can wrestle each other in their sleep and still put out a five start match. This, I hear, was one of their best. In many ways, that's sad cause I was expecting a match between these two at Wrestlemania, not here.   Oh, and Bradshaw won. So he is now the champion of Smackdown which is further proof why RAW is the better program. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure Bradshaw deserves it, but this feud isn't strong enough for several PPVs.   Also, the Undertaker killer Paul Bearer... Riiiiiiight...  So, avoid the Great American Bash at all cost.  Back to RAW, good show. Interesting storylines... except the whole Lita - Kain stuff. At least three good to great wrestling matches. I'm gonna go out on a limb and actually give this show an B+ cause it was a step in the right direction.  Mr. Tito, who actually put out his review early today, gave the show more or less the same ratting, even thought that with his description of the matches I would have swore he was going to crusify the show with a bad ratting. Guess the guy is going soft.  It's sad the way he talks about Smackdown now, considering that a year ago, he loved the show and hated RAW. This is the WWE's fault for not being able to balance out the shows correctly and, of course, for lack on interest on the Smackdown side of things.  Before I log off, would like to mention that the WWE has a little feature on their page where Ric Flair mentions his thoughts on the posibility of Sting signing for the WWE. This is an odd thing for the WWE. Why mention Sting if he hasn't signed or has no interest in signing... Unless there really might be some chance that he will sign. With the WWE, who knows? But, I will say this, if the sign Sting, I hope he can be used better than Goldberg. It doesn't sounds like Sting has a big ego like Goldberg, but you never know. All these establish stars online want to work part time gigs. Fuck em, let them retire and spend all they've won in the past. Heck, they deserve it. But, if you want to entertain and wrestle for the fans, step up and leave the bullshit at the door.   Also, WWE, I would love, and I do mean LOVE, to see Sting on RAW kicking ass and taking names, but Smackdown needs a new here. Goldberg could have been that hero. Would have given life to the show, but the WWE decided to not renew his contact (this was mutual since Goldberg wasn't to thrilled to work for the WWE and the WWE didn't care much to employ him either). HHH movie to Smackdown would have made a lot of difference and would have helped the show a lot, giving it one hell of a heel to kick people around. But HHH backed out, leaving Smackdown without a credible heel since Angle is sick (Angle he has changed from heel to face to heel so many times, I don't think people care anymore, even though everyone recognizes that he is probably the best wrestling in the company). Brock left. Big Show is injured and is taking a well deserved rest. John Cena is good, but he has a long way to go before he is considered the top dog. Undertaker is... well, old. Booker T is no longer a credible wrestler thanks to HHH. And JBL (Bradshaw) isn't a great heel, yet. So, what's left? Hardcore Holly? Billy Gunn? The cruserweights? Torrie Wilson?  Smackdown's only hope are Rey Mysterio, Chavo Guerrero and RVD, but even they aren't enough to save the show.   Sting would be a gift from the Heavens here. If handled correctly, he would do for the show what Benoit did for RAW, make it great and cool.   So, only time will tell.  I wish Mr. Vince McMahon the best of health. In case you haven't heard, he is very sick. I hope he gets better soon.   Well, with that, time to get back to my regular life.   This is  urlLink Sailor Ecchi , signing off.
