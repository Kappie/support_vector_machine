With everything from low-profile tires to a level 3 exhaust kit, nos, custom decals, and a stereo system that makes old women weep, I thought I had it all (and could teach those Fast  Furious boys a thing or two besides).  That was until I found out about  urlLink Trunk Monkey .  Now I realize that my life, and my car is truely incomplete.  Watch the videos on that site and you will know why.
