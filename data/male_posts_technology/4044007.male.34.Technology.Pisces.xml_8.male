The longer we stay in, the more intense this is going to get. It is speculated that Muqtada al-Sadr's forces used the cease-fire to stockpile weapons and prepare for this new round of violence. They are attacking U.S., British, and Iraqi security forces. According to Aljazeera’s correspondent in Najaf fighting broke out when mortar rounds, killing one and wounding four others hit the hospital. Apparently the casualties were all hospital staff. The body count was at least 15 Iraqis killed and 102 wounded. On the US side 1 soldier was killed and 5 wounded. There is more violence to report on in al-Mahawil, the road linking Al-Adhamiya and al-Mansour, Balad, and last but not least, Falluja. Let's look at both sides of the coin. Interim Iraqi interior minister Falah al-Naquib issued a statement that his government would not negotiate with al-Sadr and would continue fighting against him. Now I don’t have exact quotes here, but wouldn’t “the people’s” government sound better than “his” government? I mean if I were an Iraqi citizen and someone came up on TV declaring it “his” government I’d feel more excluded than I already would be that I didn’t select the government in the first place. That’s just me though. Not surprisingly a senior aid of al-Sadr’s stated that they will resort to military operations if the siege of Najaf by US forces is not immediately lifted. Knowing us, as in U.S., do I really have to say what’s going to happen next? O.K., I will. The interim government (our government) isn’t going to back down and neither is the US. Now the longer this drags on the more and more people will sign up for al-Sadr’s side (if they don't sign for Al-Qaeda first.) This is going to turn into Iraqi was take two. Vietnam anyone?
