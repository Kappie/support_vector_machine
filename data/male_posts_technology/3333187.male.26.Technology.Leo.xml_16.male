And to top things off it's hot inside as well as out side. Why you ask, well the building is to capacity. Actually it over capacity by about 20 people, and this is putting a strain on the air conditioning. So you can image the heat at one end of the building with about 50 odd server and a load of monitors powered on and pumping out about 1000,000,000 BTU's of heat a second. THAT'S HOT! Eh maybe, and just maybe a slight exaggeration.  So what I am trying to say here is HU-FUCKIN-RAGH for globe warming!!. Now if you will excuse me I am going down to the ice-cream freezer in the canteen and sit in it.
