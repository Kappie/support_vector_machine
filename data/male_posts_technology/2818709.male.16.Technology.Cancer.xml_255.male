I found out that otis and i both said that the verdict was just, based on the fact that the defendant's entire arguement was destroyed when that one guy confessed to knowing about the killings. Harrrr. I win. Now all i need to do is get a decent grade on that slide thingi in chem, and i'll pass all of my classes.
