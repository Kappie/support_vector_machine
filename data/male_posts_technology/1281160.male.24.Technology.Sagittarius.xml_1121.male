Shankar has tied up with Harris Jayaraj for the Music and Background Score for the film.(A.R.Rahman gone). With Manikandan Behind the Camera, Sujatha will write the dialogues for Shankar's screenplay.  Peter Hein will compose the action, while Raju Sundaram will make the Choreography. Sabu Cyril will make haste out of waste.(Art direction). The film story is made for Kamalhaasan(ROBO!), but Shankar is quite impressed with the acting of Vickram in Samy.  The story is said to be an action thriller, while Vickram playing the duo role. But the questionable part is Shankar has made Jayam Sadha as the heroine of this film. (Irresistable!!!!).  The film is expected to release on this year Diwali(Shankar don't make it for next year Chirstmas).  For more details logon   urlLink Anniyan
