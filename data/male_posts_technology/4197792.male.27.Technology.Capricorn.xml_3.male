I was actually expecting either a really cheesy movie or an extremely bad movie.  What I got was pure Hollywood mush, even though I was entertained.   Lets start with the problems:   The entire Alien mythology is more or less abandoned in this film.  The Predators brought them to Earth to hunt with using humans as "cattle" so they could host the eggs, what was that.  Bishop from Weyland Corp. Financing the expedition (they even had a brief moment of reference to the knife scene in Aliens) which I guess explains why the Nostromos was ordered to stop and investigate in Alien.  An Alien queen in chains, who came up with that idea?  This movie would have been more believable in terms of the mythology if they had been on some other planet and not in the present.  The Predators, it seems, are supposed to hunt Earth when it's hot according to the 2 movies.  Now all of a sudden they have some kind of special coming of age ritual in the Antarctic?  For being superior hunters, 2 of them sure got killed of real quick.  There was never any real explanation given for this temple they are in that is out in Antarctica.  We can't read the writers minds.   The good points -    The special effects were excellent even though a few more chest bursters would have been nice.  I loved the fact that the hero is a woman.  I wasn't actually expecting that. The story was at least coherent enough to follow even with some of the plot holes and mythology busting threads.  There was also just enough humor present and no silly sidekick.  I could go on but then I would spoil the movies for those of you who plan on watching it.  Out of 10 I would give this maybe a 5.
