Then it stopped for a while. Then I somehow lost my entire OS after merely attempting to install IE 6 again, which I was only doing to try and fix some weird .dll error. So I reinstalled my OS, and instantly became inundated with spyware all over the place. I cannot stress enough how evil that shite is and how the perpetrators of it should be dragged through a field of glass and then hung, drawn and quartered with me to slap the horses' backsides as they tear their limbs off.  That reminds me of a pub near the Tower of London called the Hung, Drawn and Quartered. But that's neither here nor there.  Anyway, I've run every kind of spyware killer I can find, edited registry files until I'm cross-eyed, and I still am unable to get rid of it all. And to top it off, my CD-Rom drive is now opening and closing over and over and it's pissing me off. This computer was purchased in 2001 so I think it's shelf-life is pretty much done. The crappy thing is that there's no way I could afford to replace it. So I shall have to Macguyver it until it finally kicks the bucket.  I'll keep it short tonight. I'd like to check my email but I have to close the browser first.
