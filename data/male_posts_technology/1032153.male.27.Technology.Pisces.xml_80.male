Imagine there's no countries, It isnt hard to do, Nothing to kill or die for, No religion too, Imagine all the people living life in peace...  Imagine no possesions, I wonder if you can, No need for greed or hunger, A brotherhood of man, Imagine all the people Sharing all the world...  You may say Im a dreamer, but Im not the only one, I hope some day you'll join us, And the world will live as one.   Comrade Helen must have been listening to this kind of claptrap for too long.  Verse 1 - Get rid of religion, be secularists, and live for today. Verse 2 - World Government (by the otiose UN and various 'cheeky darkies'?) Verse 3 - No Possessions? Suspiciously like Communist Russia, the state owns everything. Like what we do with redistributing the money of the wealthy/hardworking in New Zealand. Of course greed and possessions go hand in hand, leading to hunger....  He's a dreamer! But unfortunately he is not the only one. Helen and her merry band of Commie's are gradually (?) changing this democracy into something more sinister (a dictatorship?). How dare they make major constitutional change without a mandate! They are arrogant, and all they are interested in is ploughing ahead with their dangerous agendas. Democracy is dying. They pay no heed to the people. They tell us what is good for us. They become parents to all of us. This country is rapidly going down the plughole.  I predict that unless there is a major change in thinking in this country we will lose freedom of speech within the next 30 years. It is already starting. Paul Holmes is an example of this. We will be arrested/shutdown for calling things like homosexuality a sin. We will be silenced for criticising governmen/other religions (with the exception of Christianity). Evil will be called good, and good will be called evil.   If we don't want this to happen we have some serious work to do.   I am scared.
