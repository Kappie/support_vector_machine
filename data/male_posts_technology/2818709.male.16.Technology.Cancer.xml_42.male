I guess it's just guy's second nature to brag.  I'm so...so sorry. I'm a dumbass. I have no idea what the fuck I am doing. I'm a newb to relationships.   If you'll have me, I swear, I'll never...never...never do anything like that again....  I close my eyes and I keep seeing things Rainbow waterfalls Sunny liquid dreams Confusion creeps inside me raining doubt Gotta get to you But I don't know how Call me call me Let me know it's alright Call me call me Don't you think it's 'bout time Please won't you call and Ease my mind Reasons for me to find you Peace of mind What can I do To get me to you....  Yoko Kanno - Call me, Call me  [Look, if you dont know what this is about, please...please dont try to find out. That's what got me in trouble for the first place...]
