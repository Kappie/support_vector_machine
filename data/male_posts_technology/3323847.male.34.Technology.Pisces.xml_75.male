As time moves on, SCO looks more and more like Raymond in Rain Man, desparately trying to convince anyone who will listen that they really are an excellent driver. ;)  Frankly, considering SCO's financial situation, I really doubt they have the bucks to follow these cases into the sunset, but time shall tell.
