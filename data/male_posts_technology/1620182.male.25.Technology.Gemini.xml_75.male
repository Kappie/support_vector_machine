 Ladies and gentlemen, your democratic presidential nominee.  I took a "sick day" yesterday, meaning I only worked from 9:00am to 5:30pm instead of my usual doctor like (or  urlLink Rusty -like) hours.  I spoke to an old friend from college friend on the telephone, and her stories of delivering babies was enough to send me over the top.  
 
 Thankfully, or maybe not, the democratic nomination process is coming to a close.  Senator John Kerry destroyed Senator John Edwards last night, so the game between President Bush and Kerry is now afoot.  
 
 Several cable news stations made note of Kerry's liberal voting record last night.  In fact, one anchor cited Kerry as having the most liberal voting record of all 100 current sitting senators.  That's pretty liberal.  If this is true, I find it really fascinating that he was chosen to run for president.  It seems like the democratic party has been trying to stay in the middle of the road lately with candidates like Bill Clinton and Al Gore.  In this presidential nomination process, when the nomination came down to either Edwards (who was the last person who could claim to lean toward the middle) and Kerry (far left), Kerry blew the middle away.  Is this some sort of backlash against the ultra-right?  Are the democrats looking to fight fire with fire?  Is Kerry going to be ultra-left when he gets in office, or will he mellow and slide toward the middle?  Tune in next time...
