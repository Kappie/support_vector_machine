Reading Lord of the Ring (3hr/day) - Basically all the possible time I spend on transportation (sometimes too packed to breath, let alone reading) + the time I sit on toilet. English version, of course.  I'm not saying the Chinese version is bad (never read it actually), but I've had some pretty bad nightmares with Harry Potter.  So, if you can, original version is always encouraged to read.  You wouldn't want to read English version of ª÷±e if you can read Chinese, right?  I've just finished "The Hobbits" - Prelude to "The Lord of the Ring".  It was... to be honest, better than all the Harry Potters I've read so far (that's all the Harry Potters published so far 1~5), COMBINED!  Actually, that's not a fair comparison.  While both settings are imaginary, the Middle-Earth just makes more sense to me than the Hidden-Wizard World.  After all, Mr. Tolkien's level is totally different than Ms. Rowling (or Mrs., she's divorced, right?).  He is an well-known English Professor and one of the greatest story-teller of all time, while she's just a casual -> professional writer.  But, as I've said, it's not a fair comparison - the target audiences of both books are different.  Lord of the Ring should be read by more mature audiences, I would say 15~99+. While people who are 30+ may find Harry Potter boring and doesn't make any sense here and there. Lack of structure is, in my opinion, Harry Potter's biggest flaw... I can keep going at this, but let's stop here for a sec. I'll get to my opinions on those books someday...  WarCraft III(2hr/day) - As I've mentioned before.  Like StarCraft, good games will not perish in a short period of time.  Ben, you should know what I'm talking about, take the example of Street Fighter III - 3rd Strike (How old is this game?). I'm mainly using Night Elf, {Mass Huntress}, basically these couple days fighting with Jeremy every night until 1 (when I HAVE to get to the bed).  Workout (2hr/day) - I'm still on the bet with Jeffrey, for 5000NT (that's why the 5k after my MSN Nickname), if i lose 10kg before he gain 10kg, i win 5000k and vice-versa. I find it interesting everyday how I'm so unwilling to go, but it feels really good when you get out of there, after a long and intensive workout.  Comics (3~5hr/week) - Death Notes, HunterXHunter, ¦º¯«Bleach, One Piece, Black Cat, Shamen King, LightSpeed Mask 21, Naruto... and many others...  GameCube (1hr/week) - Super Monkey Ball 2, Pokemon Co., Viewtiful Joe, Wario Inc., Soul Calibur. (I'm waiting for my SSM coming back from JOHN...)  Hang out with Friends (???hr/week) - Mostly drinking if I meet with Jeffrey, John, Jeremy. Mostly chatting and dinnering if I meet Julian. Mostly clubbing if with Jason.  Rola (???hr/week) - When she has time, I'll do my best to take out my time to fit hers.  She's another matter I'm so not sure what to do with, all I can do now is wait and see what'll happen later (later is like... 10 years?). Mostly Shopping and talking on the phone.  Basically, other than work, my life is full of Video Game, Comics, Novels, and a little love life (not even love life ba?).  That sounds horriblly like a teenager's life (other than the work part), I guess, I'm still a "Tweenager" - Teenager at their Twenties.  This Life is heading where, I don't know.  I don't want to rate it, either.  Because I believe there's no good or bad. Okay, there is, but who knows? Only Time can tell.  On a 2nd note, this life style won't last long.  It'll end by the end of July, to be exact.  And I'll be heading back to Vancouver by the end of August.  And we shall see what's waiting for me...
