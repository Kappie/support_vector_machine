Since my nizzo Jwump is too busy taking it in the ass at work to bitch about his boss....and it isn't uncommon that he shares his pain with me...I feel I am qualified to bitch in proxy of Jwump.  The Seagull.......  Works very few hours   Spawned a mini-hippy   Likes...body hair....her body hair....hence she never removes it   Is passive aggressive   Says things like "If you could go ahead and _______ that'd be great...thanks"   Lactates Soy milk   Hates plants so much that it's all she'll eat.  (I don't eat meat cause i'm not into flesh)   Says she loves the Earth, but drives a car that needs to stop at weight stations   Makes more than shez worth   Likes to offload her responsibilities on Jwump   In summary....shes like.....well.....my boss......minus the lactating of course.
