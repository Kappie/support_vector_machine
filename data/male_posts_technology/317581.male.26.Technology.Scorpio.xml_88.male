My alarm clock ("my cell phone") has a 6 minute snooze button, which is the stupidest thing I've heard of yet.... Take this morning for instance, I wake up at 7:20 to my alarm and hit snooze("I don't actually have to be on the road until about 8:15 or so and it only takes me about 15 minutes to get ready in the morning"), well at 7:26 when I'm about to fall asleep again, right at the point of losing consciousness, it goes off again.... I mean how annoying is that? So I hit the snooze again and history repeats itself at 7:32... I hate this snooze button soooooo bad.... Maybe it's time I took my regular alarm clock back from Cahlen
