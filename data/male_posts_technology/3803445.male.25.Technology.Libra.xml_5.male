But it's ok; they were beginning to annoy me anyway, stringing us along for the long 4th of July weekend while we could have been looking at other homes, while they fished for a better offer.  We already picked out several other homes we want to look at and our Realtor will be sending us a fresh list from the MLS later today.  Oh, goody!  More house-hunting! :|
