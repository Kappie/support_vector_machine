We shouldn't be overspecialized, but should represent the diversity present within the community.  Hellenic polytheism includes, but isn't limited to Hellenion and other "Hellenic Reconstructionist" groups and individuals, Hellenic wiccans, people devoted to Hellenic deities but not all that concerned with reconstructionism, a "group" (for lack of a better word) called "Hellenic Traditionalists" and more.  What  does  concern me is what seems like divisive behavior driving potential wedges between us all in ways that aren't necessarily healthy or helpful. I'm talking about antagonistic behavior, of which any of us can be guilty from time to time, but which I've been witnessing more than I feel comfortable with here lately.  Drew Campbell's book is not beyond criticism, but it's also far from worthless. I've seen Hellenion called too liberal, too conservative, and that it tries to be all things to all people, and the simple fact is that these can not all be objectively true at the same time. People make statements reflecting their subjective impressions, and those statements are objectified (sometimes by the speaker, and sometimes by offended readers/listeners).  Can't we all try to get along?  Since the  very first day  that sponde.com came into being, I've tried to get people from various camps to contribute articles, hymns, and pretty much  anything  else. But so far, almost every word of content on the site has come from members of Hellenion, the organization that everyone seems to love to hate. Does this mean that only Hellenion members are publishing things of value? I'd hesitate to go that far, but I would much rather be able to offer a definite  NO .  I'm not sure I have one simple solution to this problem, but I do think that we'd be better off if we poured more of this energy into actual Hellenic polytheism. Isn't that something we can agree on enough to put all this other stuff to bed?
