Right now, I am sitting on an über comfy couch sipping a doubly über good Classic Mugs Drip and right next to my good ol' buddy Rosalie, copying everything she's typed up to now.     But on the lighter side, everything seems to be going quite well. The laptops haven't overheated (yet) and I'm gonna upload in just a second, all 24 AP's we've found. I'll audioblog from Mugs here in a second!  "Those who would sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither liberty nor security." -Ben Franklin (Consider the PATRIOT ACT.)  -beej
