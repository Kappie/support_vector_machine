The Murkowski Two are not doing well in this recent poll.   urlLink G-Murkowski  (the former S-Murkowski) and  urlLink S-Murkowski  (the former little s-murkowski) are sliding in the opinion polls.  This doesn't surprise me.  G-Murkowski went back to AK, waltzed in, and expected to have the same influence that he had in the Senate.  Well Alaskans, as I assume most people, do not like being told what to do.  And that seems to be G's modus."This is how it's gonna be, if you don't like it, think of something better or we're going with my plan.  You have five minutes."
