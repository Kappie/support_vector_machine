Well, the "road heighth" is 198' over the water / and the Tower heighth is 354'...nice belly flop off the roadway??? less than 5 seconds falling 100 mph and hitting the water??? DAMN! Sue used to kid me about calling her when I got home so she wouldn't worry....she used to say "I'd never even know it if you fell off the bridge" and I'd give her some smart ass answer like "sure ya would, it'd be all over the news the next day"...lol...guess that's not funny   urlLink http://www.ce.jhu.edu/mdcive/lanebay.htm
