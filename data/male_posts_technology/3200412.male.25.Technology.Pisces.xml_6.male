She has been visiting friends in the eastern US for the last week, and she decided that she was too close to her family in the Maritimes to NOT go visit them.  Up until last night, she gave me the impression that she might be there for a day or two.  The last time I saw her was July 23rd.  The next time I see her will be August 23rd.  I'm a bit of a mess as a result.  She thinks I'm angry with her, but that's not it really.  Yeah, I'm upset that she just kind of dumped all of this on me.  More than that though, I feel abandoned.  We were supposed to fix the condo up this month in order to sell it.  Am I to do that alone now?  She's not bringing in any income if she's out of town, so I'm stuck with covering all of the bills out of my own pocket in the meantime as well.  I wanted to kick out our room mates at the beginning of September as well, but it looks like that will be financially impossible too.  I had been hoping to find a new job through all of this too, but with all of this going on that's really not feasible.   The stress of everything is weighing very heavily on me.  Part of me has become very cold and hard.  I don't know what this means for her and I anymore.  I don't know if I can take any more surprises.
