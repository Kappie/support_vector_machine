Anyway, around 7:15 Poncho came over to grab some Airsoft beebs, he wanted some more. That dude I bought my   FAULTY   gun from will give me a refund, but only through  urlLink SquareTrade  which costs $20.00 and my gun was $27.99, so FTW? (Fuck the WHAT?)  It's a Counter-Strike thing. Lizz, Katie's friend lives here in FoCo, and she don't mountain bike. Another FTW.  Melanie owes me a dollar.  I miss Kelly.  Life isn't bad.  -beej
