If u buy the cassette "Annamacharya kirtanas by MS" this will be the last song in that cassette. This is my favorite... I've got an emotional bonding to this song... Literally tears flow out of my eyes when I listen to it... just try it... not sure if it'll be of ur liking... but it surely drenches my heart everytime I hear...
