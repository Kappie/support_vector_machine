Birthed to a mother who had never known a man before Ronald senior. First born son to a couple that got engaged to each other six weeks into their courtship...a seamstress and a cab driver. Two devoted Christians serving one god. Three years into their marriage, the gifted prince of the tidewater was born. A son encouraged to throw caution to circumstance, yet grown to tell the world about vigilance  trust  My brother, sister  I were all born a year  three months apart from each other...penal twist of irony, if you ask me. The mindset of a typical Stevenson child...if you're not the oldest, you're just alive. The eldest in age...it is my burden...it is my curse.  "Sometimes I wish the ring had never come to me..."  Four years in the valley, my father passed due to heart failure. As my mother was more comfortable around her own sisters  brothers, she took the big leap  moved from VA to SC, relocating to a town names Calhoun Falls. A land forgotten by time, secluded in a lakeland wilderness, disguising the scars of time past....arriving to a new age where new scars had yet to be revealed. A noble prince, from his native reality once removed, now sought only one goal: To return to the land that his father governed, erase the shortcomings, instill hope, renew the creativity  restore peace to the land of lovers. Unfortunately, the kingdom was soon toppled by the imperfect ventures of time...the suttle thief of youth. Gone, gone from the land of men was the noble dilligence of a trying few. Now a far more luminous  ardent task looms on the horizon. The heir of a forgotten kingdom, this  vagrant prince , must  rebuild the kingdom of hope..from once a mighty reign, so must it be born again.  The days of adversity strike me deeply. Multiple family disorders, a call of duty in a land of ancient mystery and a faith desperately searching  waiting on God now befall me. I can see the healing process beginning to take shape, however. God has given me a special friend that is more than willing to help me regain my fallen homeland. Included with a close friend from the proving grounds, I believe that the time has come for the fulfillment of my destiny.  But first I must cross this desert...
