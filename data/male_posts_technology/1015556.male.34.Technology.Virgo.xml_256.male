Nothing like a meeting in the corporate world... Anyway, one of the things we did was talk about 04-05 school year goals. Also a key piece to our goals was fitting them in to the overall Grace strategy, which is as: G - God's Word R - Relationships A - Authentic Worship C - Compassion E - Every Person Participating  Ok, now some of you might find it a little hokey that there is an acronym based on our church's name into specific goals.  But give us a little slack, huh?  And anyway, I think, when I try to be objective about it, that those elements make up a really good strategy...  More on goals later... I think some of the pondering about some stuff I learned at Origins and thinking about next year is starting to come together...
