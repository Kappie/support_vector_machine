I'll be starting home on thursday night for diwali...  and at work.. am doing some programming with.. guess what... COBOL and CICS... Yep..!! some mainframe stuff... no... not moved from my good old .NET ... but this is an initiative to integrate mainframes with microsoft technologies.. and I'm starting with the mainframe part of it and have to look at ways of integrating it with .NET so that we could get a real-time processing (rather than batch processing) with mainframe in the picture..  And yet to see views about that topic... I too am thinking on it...
