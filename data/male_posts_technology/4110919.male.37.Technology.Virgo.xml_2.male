No, he’s not He passed last year   Ask somebody else Ask anyone else If I have to choose Which of us will lose What I’m gonna do Is say “Better it’s you Thank me!”  tell me First you got to ask yourself “What is the decision you’re makin?” You see the way you’re Look into the toolbox to decide the tools you’re taking And then you’ve got to Absorb, and apply Estimate  It might work if you try your ABC and after you’re promoted you can buy A BM. Oh no, no.  If all this talk has made you weak And it’s an easy life you seek Don’t do your MBA Take your eighty grand And book a holiday  Chill out, exams are in two weeks With a few assignments inbetween What are we doing here We should be interviewing An Entrepreneur  Ask somebody else Ask anyone else I forgot where I was I think it was because The union’s on strike for Telkom to hike their pay  Tell me When did this MBA get so complicated You see the way we’re Always getting new text books gets me frustrated First you’ve got to Unlock and Unpack The you cram for exams But if you get it right, What a fat salary you’ll be raking Oh. Oh, oh!
