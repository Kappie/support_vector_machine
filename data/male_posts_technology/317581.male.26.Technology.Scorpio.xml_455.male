I've decided I'm going back to Oregon on tuesday and will be back up here on friday.  I just finished "The Tao of Pooh" which talks about Tao-ism and how the characters in Winnie the pooh relate to Taoism. It was very enlightening. Tao-ism seems to be a very go with the flow of life idea, which is what I like about it.  Anyway, I went to Trillogy tuesday (all the Lord of the rings shows on tuesday december 16th.) It was pretty good, and I feel like i got my nerd-ness fill for the rest of the year:)  Well, gotta run, Peace- Tim
