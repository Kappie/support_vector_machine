Yeah, thats INSIDE my eye. They referred to it as a "floater".. its when a small part of the gel in your eye hardens a bit - just enough that you can see it. Apparently it eventually sinks to the bottom of my eye but that'll take a little while.  Also mentioned I'm a little young for that to happen (25) but its nothing to worry about.  So good news, and bad news I guess.  I do need glasses though, as it appears I have astigmatism, but its minor and I don't need to wear them all the time.  If it helps my headaches, BRING THEM ON!
