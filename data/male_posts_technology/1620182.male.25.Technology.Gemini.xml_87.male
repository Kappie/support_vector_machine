I knew it was going to be bad here on Long Island when I saw prices approaching $2.00 for regular unleaded in VA, but I was floored when I saw the gas station on the corner.  $2.19, $2.29, $2.49.  Can you believe this?  And you can guess which type of gas has to go in my car.  That's right, premium.  Thankfully, Exxon has Tiger Tuesdays where I get to pay the price of Super for Premium.  It still cost me $36 to fill my 16 gallon tank though.  I need to stop driving.
