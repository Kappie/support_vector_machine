I phone ticketmaster at about 6 o'clock and they said that there was still tickets and it was cabaret style and that it was too late for phone orders but tickets would be available at the door.   We get there and the place was huge, like an airplane hangar, and it's completely sold out! So we're standing around the entrance like idiots looking for scalpers. It would have been a lot easier if we had a sign that said "Need Tickets" since neither of us are the type to ask everyone if they had extras as they entered.  how did I get in? stay tuned...
