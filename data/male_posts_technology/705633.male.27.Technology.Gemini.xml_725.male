The thing that really deserves a mention however is the driving.  I'd heard about Italian drivers beforehand. Apparently they drive really close to you and pretty fast. This is not correct. The correct thing to say would be that Italians are fucking insane behind the wheel of a car. Almost every car I saw in Naples had a big scratch, a dent or a panel missing. Sometimes all three. They drive literally inches from each other.  After leaving the airport and getting a taxi to our hotel, I found myself being driven down a hill. In the wet. Very fast. On a cobbled street. At night. On the wrong side of the road. Around a blind corner. He then got to the bottom and went the wrong way around the roundabout, nonchalantly flicking his cigarette ash into the oncoming traffic.     At one point in the piazza in Sorrento, there were buses, scooters, pedestrians, baby buggies, motorcycles and even stray dogs performing a strange ballet and missing each other by the width of a mosquito's pube. It was pretty amazing to watch.
