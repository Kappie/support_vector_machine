The PowerEdge 1750 has a lengthy list of remarkable features.Making the most of the inherent constraints of a 1U box,this machine and the HP ProLiant DL360 G3 are the only two servers in our roundup with dual redundant power supplies,yet only the PowerEdge 1750 offers two power supplies without taking up a PCI slot. The PowerEdge 1750 has seven user-replaceable cooling fans,though they tend to run a bit noisily.These fans,along with those in the IBM eServer xSeries 335,are highly reliable:When one fails,the others rev up to a higher speed to compensate. Although there isn ’t much room for innovation in 1U chassis design,the PowerEdge 1750 manages to stand apart from the rest with its unique chassis,whose top opens like a book to reveal the inner components —making it much installed software with version identification,enabling firmware and OS upgrades with one click.  OpenManage Array Manager lets you create virtual disks,volumes,and partitions,both locally and remotely,while Asset Information stores acquisition data as well as leasing information,depreciation values,maintenance statistics,and warranty information.Also included is Dell ’s IT Assistant software,which acts as a central console application for managing multiple servers,storage devices,and client systems across the network using SNMP,DMI,and CIM protocols,as well as Server Assistant, easier to service.The Active ID indicator lights takes servicing one step farther by including a blue locator light,which helps identify a specific server in a fully populated rack.  Every Dell server ships with the Dell OpenManage suite of management tools.OpenManage Server Administrator is a browser-based tool for managing individual servers.Server Administrator lets you schedule diagnostic tests on CPUs,the PCI bus,Ethernet and COM ports,hard drives,and RAID controllers. It monitors fan speeds,DIMM status(with failure history),temperature,and voltage status,and it provides a view of for simplified OS and driver installation,server setup,and RAID configuration. The Dell PowerEdge 1750 is a well loaded 1U box.It ’s a strong performer —highly reliable and easy to service and upgrade —and it comes with a solid suite of management tools.You can ’t go wrong with this excellent system.
