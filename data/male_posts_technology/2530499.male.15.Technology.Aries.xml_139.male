So,  urlLink Kelz0rz  returned today, and this made me rather happy in the happy sort of way. BUT, she lost her fscking CD's on the plane, which meant that I made and delivered (in a UPS NextDay envelope) with markings and a TransitScan and Tracking Number and URGENT: SUNDAY OR HOLIDAY DELIVERY and "DEN" marked on it. Looked very important. Around six or so, I biked over to Dimmer's and me and Dick, Steve, Allison, and my father all sat aroud and watched people blow shit up in the air. It was fun. We then rode home and now I'm gonna take a shower 'cause I smell like DEET and it's not a very good smell. Have fun doing whatever.
