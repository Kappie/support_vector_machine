The temperature has dropped lately, and its already cool at nights (12 degrees). Its nice for sleeping but its an omen of things to come - yuck! Tonight I've got a rehearsal for my gig on the 20th.  I'm not really looking forward to the gig, because its right when I'd like to be on holiday on my boat.  There are only a few good weeks left in the summer and I don't like to loose one of them.  I'd rather gig in September, but we have to do this to get there - oh well...  I've gigged so often that its not much of a thrill anymore - its just something that I like to do.  It feels comfortable and natural - like a job you enjoy. Tomorrow, I'm going to do the electrical work for the kitchen reno.  I've got to wire up some applicances and lights.  Tomorrow night, we're going for dinner at N's place which should be fun. Sunday I'm going boating - I'm looking forward to that. Today, I'm wrapping up some work from the week and looking forward to having a couple of days off to pursue some of my own interests - which is what weekends are all about! Have a great weekend!
