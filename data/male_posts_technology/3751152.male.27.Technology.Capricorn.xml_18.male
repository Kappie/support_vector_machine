Sure, its fun for a little while, but it takes twice as long to recuperate, not to mention the fact that the process of recovery is twice as harrowing as getting tipsy is amusing (a concept that, admittedly, TCZ spods seem pretty familiar with).  However, what’s worse than getting really, really drunk, is getting really, really drunk at the same party your parents are at and then having to go home with them, sleep in the same house as them and therefore subsequently have to  wake up  in the same house as them.    I bring this up because this was exactly the predicament that I found myself in last night.  Let me just tell you, if I never have another sip of alcohol in the presence of my parents again it will be too soon.  Anyway, as you can probably imagine (or recall, if this has ever happened to you), this morning has made me greatly regret last night as it's been a lovely medley of kneeling over the bath-tub, bouts of insane awkwardness that ensued about the time of our rather rude awakenings (as it were), and other pleasant things of that nature.    So, allow me to close with two final thoughts, which are really just the same final thought repeated for emphasis: God damn margaritas, god  damn  them.  End Rant;
