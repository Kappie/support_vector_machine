In the 1860s, a student of Charles Darwin named Francis Galton tried to convince the ruling class of England of the virtues of eugenics.  He's credited with the following quote: "I do not see why any insolence of caste should prevent the gifted class, when they had the power, from treating their compatriots with all kindness, so long as they maintained celibacy. But if these continued to procreate children inferior in moral, intellectual and physical qualities, it is easy to believe the time may come when such persons would be considered as enemies to the State, and to have forfeited all claims to kindness."  Margaret Sanger, who during the 1900s was a eugenics proponent and member of both the American Eugenics Society and the English Eugenics Society, is quoted in Elsah Droghin's  Pivot of Civilization  as saying: "Those least fit to carry on the race are increasing most rapidly ... Funds that should be used to raise the standard of our civilization are diverted to maintenance of those who should never have been born."  I feel it's necessary to quote these prominent people to show the mindset of eugenics supporters during the late 1800s and early 1900s.  This policy was looked on as beneficial the time and necessary for the prosperity of the kingdom.  Another supporter of eugenics programs might be more well known to you: Adolf Hitler.  He believed that only through the purity of the 'master' race would Germany rise to power.  We know that his motives were horrific, monstrous, and any other superlatives you choose to apply would be accurate, but how is what he was trying to do any different than what Galton and Sanger were advocating?  Bear with me, I'm getting to the point.  The mention of the word eugenics should send shivers up the spine of any reasonable human being.  Which is exactly what I felt this morning when a friend sent over a news article detailing a disturbing practice that's recently come to light in the United States.  Unborn babies with minor physical defects, most of which are reparable by medical procedures, are being aborted.  Read that again. While the number of cases are very small, 6 cases in 2000 (five of the babies had deformed feet, the sixth had a cleft lip and palette) then 9 total abortions across 2001 and 2002 (eight cleft lip and palette, one cleft lip), if this trend were to continue we could be paving the way to accepted eugenics in the US.  I hope, for the sake of the unborn children out there that could still live long, fulfilling lives, that this doesn't become a rising trend.  Bear in mind, this type of mindset doesn't just have supporters from the 1800s, in actuality the English Eugenics Society I mentioned earlier actually still exists, they have merely changed their name to the Society for the Study of Social Biology.  Watch out folks, there are people out there pushing for this to be an accepted practice in civilized society.  This issue brings up the same old questions we've been mulling over: When is it really okay to abort a child?  Does the parent have the right to abort a child when the disability is something that can be overcome with therapy and procedures?  I don't pretend to have the answer to these questions, and it's such a divisive topic that I'll leave it to you to make your own decision.
