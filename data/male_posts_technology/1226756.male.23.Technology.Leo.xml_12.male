Late saturday night, I reinstalled Slackware 9.0 with only the bare essentials, and I started playing with DNS (BIND) and apache. I've set up apache before, so that wasn't the problem. Getting BIND to run, and VirtualHosts in apache was the pain. However some reading of a few norwegian tutorials, I fell back to a tutorial at  urlLink linuxhomenetworking.com   urlLink Chapter 6  is the exact location. This tutorial was great reading when I allready had read about DNS. If you've played with linux for a short while, and know the basics, this is the best tut I've found out there. They also have a lot more tuts on their site. The HOWTO and  urlLink tldp.org  written by Nicolai Langefeldt was to long, and contained much more info than what was really needed. That was only confusing. After fixing a few typos in the config files, BIND started and played like a charm. I changed httpd.conf to match my server name and other basic things. The next step was VirtualHosting. Everything was so simple when the basics was there. Now I have two domains running on my server. I'm not online with the server yet, but that will come. The next challenge is getting e-mail up and running for the domains. I'm using the Sendmail chapter from  urlLink linuxhomenetworking.com  Hope toget it all working soon.
