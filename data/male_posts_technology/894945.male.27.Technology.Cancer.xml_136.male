To be honest I don't know how I feel, what to do, what to say.....I'm gutted ( bottom lip starting to quiver ). It's like a great big whole has opened up under my feet. The only thing getting me through this is my mates such as Custard and Toaster, it really does help. I don't know how things will turn out, in fact I can't focus on tomorrow at the moment! All one can do is grin and bare it and take it like a responsible person I guess. Cheers to my mates, and a big 'FUCK YOU' to whomever, or what ever, wrote this event into my fateful destiny. I know it will work out one way or another, just got to play it out. Sorry for being totally depressing...Baity signing off...
