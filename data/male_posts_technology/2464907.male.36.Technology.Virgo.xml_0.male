How can someone not be monitoring the corporate web site for the company? Well anyway somehow we had a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) and had to cold boot the server for the site to come back up. Everything is back up now and working fine, but we have started working on a new monitoring service. You know how it works; we put things in place after things break. Why cannot we do that before they break?     J
