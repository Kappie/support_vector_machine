She emailed me on Monday when she got back into town, and asked that I call her after I put the kids to bed (so that she wouldn't wake them with the phone).  I called her at around 8:30, and we talked for about 2 hours.  I think we got along very well on the phone.  She's agreed to meet me tonight for a drink or whatever, after my therapy appointment.  That works out well for me -- the restaurant we're meeting at is within 15 minutes of Mo's house, so that works.  I came clean with S about my lack of a tattoo, because I believe in being honest.  I can't believe I put that in my profile in the first place!  And then she asked me about it in one her first emails -- I just ignored the question and removed it from my profile.  She said that she later looked at my profile and saw that I had no body art, and she felt like an ass for asking me.  But then she asked me what else I lied about in my profile.  Well, I stated that I'm divorced, but I'm really going through the proceedings now (I feel justified saying I'm divorced, because there's no chance that we're getting back together, vs. separated where there's that chance).  Also, I think Dean put in my profile that I read Da Vinci Code, when I actually haven't.  I think Dean also said that sometimes I read as many as three books at a time, but really I don't read much at all.  Maybe it's accurate.  The real answer is that I start many books and finish few.   So I'll do another post after our date.
