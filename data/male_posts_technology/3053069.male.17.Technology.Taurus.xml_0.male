I made the final descion to join guard, now lets hope that i make the try outs. thas it, thats all i did. I am back in the rain season, so it is hard to mountainboard or rock climb b/c of the mud. But i can bike. that would be a good thing, to go biking, a good 15mile ride does a person good. ok see ya
