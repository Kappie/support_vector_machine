We may have to form a clan soon.  I picked up RalliSport Challenge 2 last night and ran the first race on the "Amateur" level.  I was not very used to how the car handles on dirt (I've only ever raced in PGR  PGR2), so I made quite a few flubs.  I still placed 1st out of 20, though.  I will be giving more thoughts on RSC2 as I progress through the career.  On a non-XBox note, I had a free PC game coupon in my hot little hand, so I went to Best Buy and picked up  urlLink Korsun Pocket .  There were several other choices, obviously, but I had several thoughts on the matter.  First of all, I want a game that I will  play .  I spend little gaming time on my PC now, so I'm not going to get any game that I can play on my XBox.  Also, I would like to get something that I can play in an "interrupted" fashion.  Nothing with a long, deep storyline or that requires long periods of undivided attention.  And I don't want to have to upgrade my PC.  I may have gotten  urlLink City of Heroes , but they were sold out.  I don't know how much time I could devote to a MMORPG anyway.  Korsun Pocket seemed to fit the bill perfectly.  I haven't played any sort of strategy board game in years and years, but it was my introduction (along with AD) to gaming in the first place.  It's the whole reason I got into computers in the first place; I discovered that you could play games on computers.  I can play for single turns or for hours at a stretch.  I can play by email.  And I don't have to change a thing on my PC.  I could have waited and bought Doom 3 on release, but then I would need a whole new system.  I would much rather wait for Doom 3 for the XBox.  I have the perspective now to see why consoles like the XBox are so awesome.  But I also know that something like Korsun Pocket will never be on any console, nor should it be attempted.
