Others, Any thought?  coming to kicha's Know (K)not, I feel its just for a companion sake... (moreover its a well to do  decent job only)... Only for company's sake means No brandy shop owners will get a bride!!! and other gender-specific roles also? Its similar to finding wouldbe's in the local sorounding itself instead of geting from 50000 miles away although they are of same caste, creed etc....  I think, its better not to think about these things...   Rini, while reading ur splendid summary I can visualize what all could have occurred... but sorry anyway missed the event, let us c a year later...  Cheers Ram
