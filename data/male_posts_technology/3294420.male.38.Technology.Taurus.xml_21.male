I hadn't seen the newest pictures where Maya has filled out more and it brought tears to my eyes of happiness for all that Maya, Mom, and Dad Bender have gone through and OH what an ending!!  This experience has shown us the love of family, friends, and strangers and  most of all- the love of God.      Love, your Ct Mom
