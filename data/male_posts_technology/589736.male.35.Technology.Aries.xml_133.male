President Bush has reaffirmed his opposition to Kyoto (phew).  I am a little concerned that some lower level government official (Christine Todd Whitman at the highest) has the authority to send such a report, supposedly representing the view of the President, to the UN when the report does not agree with his opinion / policy.  In other words - what the hell is going on in DC?
