My stomach has been filled with battery acid and given two hours on spin-cycle. Still, I met some lovely young ladies and had a fantastic night so who gives a shit.. if that hot little Irish blonde reads this then please get in touch, call it crazy but I experienced a serene moment of peace and tranquility with your butt grinding away in front of me. :)  This saturday i'll be doing a spot of DJ'ing at the Q Bar with the Dapper Crew. If you like R'n'B and hip hop, or fancy some different music for a change, come on down. It starts at 10PM and it's £3 entry.   Here's the latest bollocks from my Inbox..
