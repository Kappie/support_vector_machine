From the article in  urlLink Seattle Times    "Most of the pollution in downtown Seattle today is our own, don't forget that," says Dan Jaffe, a Professor of Environmental Science at the University of Washington's Bothell campus. "But what the pollution from Asia does is add to the background levels, and a few days a year, these pollution levels can be high enough to push us up over the EPA's ozone limit."  This could have an interesting implication for international politics.  After we have started a war based, in part, on satellite images of chemical bases can we start a war because some rogue nation is polluting the earth?
