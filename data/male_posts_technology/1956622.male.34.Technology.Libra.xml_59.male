Well that plan backfired on me.  I am not sure what was going on but from the sounds of it Karissa was taking a rocket of some kind from Jimmy and they were fighting over it.  So needless to say I got to say Happy 4th of July to Karissa who in turn told   FS  !    Then she did not want to talk anymore due to the fighting and mood she was now in.  I let her go as she was going to hang up on  me anyway.    When I hung up I did so feeling guilty:        I always hear the kids outside or doing something with   FS         I don't recall doing all that much with the kids (Maybe it was the 2 years of depression I was supposedly suffering from).        despite my attempts to make her happy when she was with me   SFW   sounds happier now then she ever did with me!    I am sure that I must have had times when I did fun things with the kids and stuff but to be honest as I sit here typing this I have a hard time remembering them.  That may be in part due to my 6 month haetus away from the kids, maybe the things I did do have been overshadowed by the ugly mess that is going on, or maybe I just did not do that much.  I hate the thought that an adulterer and a person of unsound morals and ethics being a better dad then I.    In addition I spent the night dreaming about   SFW  !  I know what you are thinking but it was not that kind of dream.  In fact if I had to put it into a movie it would almost play out like a chick flick.  I did not want to dream about her but I did!   I think I needed a parental mind filter! Capable of blocking out images of   SFW  !   I wonder if she ever thinks of me....Other then someone trying to put her in jail?  So here it is 4th of July I have to work and have chosen to sit here and do homework for the rest of the day.  I have to get it done so I would like to get as much done as possible so I do not have to take time away from Karissa while she is here to do it.    In addition I leave Thursday and will not be back until Sunday so that is going to cost me participation points I am sure but Karissa is worth it.  I have so much to do this week and so little to spend to get it done.          get a present for Karissa (I have it just have not purchased it yet)     figure out how to get the damn pool to a normal PH level and alkeline     haul off all this wood and debris so the yard is clean for her     pack for the trip    I forgot to mention yesterday that   SFW   actually agreed to pick me up from the bus station when I get into town! I did not even ask she offered!  I said well I will have to figure out where I am going to stay that night and again she suprised me and said "We will figure something out"  My luck she is planning a pine box about 6 feet in length and 3 feet wide!
