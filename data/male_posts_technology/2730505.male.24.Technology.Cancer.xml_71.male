St. Patrick's day was yesterday but we didn't manage to get to the bar till about 10 pm.  I was out shopping for shit for the new apartment and just got back sorta late.  Anyways, there was this bar/restaurant that's called The Village.  Nice quaint Irish bar/restaurant.  It was packed.  I saw some kinds from HS there (Zagotta, Kevil, Murray, Kolasinki) and we talked for a little while.  For some apparent reason they remembered me as Gonzalo.  That's nuts because I have never been Gonzalo to anyone.  In HS I was 'Al.'  I took the AL from gonzALo to sound more American since I thought that people would have problems saying my name.  That's why I didn't understand that they'd remember me by my government name.  We talked for a little while and that was cool.  Everyone was having a good time at the bar and then towards the end of the night, I don't know why but people started yelling at people and Jerry's cousin's all of a sudden were up on a bunch of kids faces.  That was just wierd so I tried to ignore the thing because usually things get broken up anyways.  So things got a little bit settled and back to normal for all of 1 minute.  The punk ass kids got kicked out of the bar and we were about ready to go as well.  We got outside and there they were, waiting for us.  So more talking ensued as I stayed to the outside of the confrontation.  I was just wanting to go home but at the same time I was intrigued with the situation.  I was thinking to myself, if a brawl broke out, I wouldn't do anything unless there was some sort of team up against one of my friends.  The ensuing dialogue followed the heated bellowing of threats and obscenities.  Gonzo:*watching about 7 feet from the crowd* Fat Guy (to my group of friends):"Hey man, all I gotta say is that I'm sorry" Fat Guy's girlfriend (to Fat Guy):"Your not fucking sorry" Gonzo:*starts laughing hysterically at the girl's comment* Fat Guy:"You think this is funny man?" Gonzo:*just laughs and shrugs it off not saying a word* Fat Guy:"You're laughing?  You think this is funny?" Gonzo:"Yes I think this is funny" Fat Guy:*lobs half a plastic cup of beer at Gonzo* Gonzo:*Calmly side-steps the beer thrown at his general direction* "You missed" Fat Guy:"You still think this is funny, pick my trash up" *walking towards GOnzo*  This is where Jerry's cousins came back and started yelling at the other guys to back off and so did the bouncers.  It wasn't like I was egging the guy on.  I was just laughing because the girlfriend of the fat guy was funny.  I didn't egg him on by engaging him in some form of dialogue.  I didn't try to start anything again.  I was thinking about it was late, I wanted to go home.  I had work to think about etc. etc. etc.  Meghan called and I detached myself from the potential brawl and talked to her.  A few minutes later the cops came and everyone went home.  I was sober but I know that Jerry's cousins and those punk ass kids weren't.  It would have been an interesting fight considering Jerry's cousins and their friends were like bulldogs.  I wouldn't want to fuck with those guys.  If they were to get into it, I think that it would take 4 of those kids to get on one of Jerry's cousins.  There were only 5 of them and some girls, there was 8 of us.  Well I guess I can count as half or something.  ;-)  Oh well.  As much as I wanted to get into it with those kids, it just wasn't worth it.  That's my St. Patrick's Day.
