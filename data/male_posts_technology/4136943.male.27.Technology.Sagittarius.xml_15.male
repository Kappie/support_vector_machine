What is  urlLink NAAFA  you ask? It is of course the  National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance . Whaaa???!!! Not only is there such an organization, but they were uttering all sorts of nonsense such as denouncing a connection between obesity and health. There is no connection according to the lady on the radio. Not only that, but then they went so far as to say (paraphrased) "We [Americans] are getting fatter and fatter, but we are also living longer...coincidence?" Again, I say "WHAAA???!!!..."  It's likely that the person speaking on the radio did not represent the entire organization, and looking at their website they do have some noble goals, but still c'mon people. Lose some weight, do not revel in your fatness.
