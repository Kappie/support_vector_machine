I was quite pleased with Ep4, and will buy the other two this year (should the vendor return).  The only minor quibble is that it pauses briefly at four places where the laser disc has to be turned over...but a small sacrifice to enjoy the movie I actually saw.  For the record, I'll be happy to buy discs for others who provide the cash beforehand.
