I heard a new word today: Sneakretive. It's a cross between sneaky and secretive. Feel free to start using it in your own daily life. 7. Here's a word I'm trying to bring back: Cinchy. 8. Blog Madness is driving me crazy. But... That doesn't mean you shouldn't vote. 9. I put up a cool post on my site. But nobody's coming by... 10. My ex's mother has started reading my site. AND she works for the government! GASP! 11. AND THIS IS A BIG ONE! What if we put up Paypal buttons on this site and all of our personal websites to raise money for a face to face meeting of The Real World? It would have to be a central location for all of us... I dunno... Just a thought. What do you guys think? 12. I love my fish. They are cool. But my new Kribensis is very sneakretive. 13. I love both Photobucket AND Belle. 14. I am to blame for nothing. 15. LA and OC members: Would you guys wanna come see my show?  16. I miss you Marci. Even though you have not accepted your panties. 17. Miller High Life is truly The Champagne of Beers.
