Her test results last week were positive, which, in this case is a bad thing.  The latest ray of hope is that the doctor will re-run the test tomorrow to rule out a false positive.  If it comes back negative, Julie will probably come home.  If it comes back positive, she still might, but her OB and the twin specialist will have to come to an agreement.  At this point, she is 30 weeks, and the doctors ideally want her to "hold out" (like any of this is up to her) until 34 weeks.  In the meantime I am still doing my juggling act balancing work, the house, my daughter, and visiting Julie. Is sleep necessary?  Everyone please think NEGATIVE!  And then to top it off, I managed to arrange for a sitter for Katherine on Sunday (RTG), and Ben has the audacity of stopping at a stop sign / red light in front of a drunk driver, contributing to the cancellation of the session.  Way to go dude!  All kidding aside, I'm glad you're OK, and that the Honda lived up to its safety reputation
