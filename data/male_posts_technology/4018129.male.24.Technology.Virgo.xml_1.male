Like a phone call.. or an unexpected visitor.. or I'd get half done.. and this ol' machine would crash harder than me after 3 days of soild gaming.  So... Todays post is why I love life. Most of my friends probally could agree that I've been a tad bitter lately.  So.. here are some reasons I love life.  One. My friends and family. Yep.. with out this lot of people my life would be pretty pointless. My family are like friends... and my friends are like family.  So I'm pretty lucky. My family allways supports me and I get along great with them. Even my wacky parents... whom, if you know, understand tomes about me...  My friends... I feel the need to say a little more about.  My friends allways have my back.. even when I'm making some obvious brain dead life choice that will haunt me for three or so years. (wink). My friends have lobbed "Phat Stacks of Cash" at me when times have been tough. They never ask for anything in return.  Any hour of any day.. I can find one person who will listen to me go on about what ever minor problem is ruleing my mind at the momment. And that poor person usually winds up being the same lad who's Blog lead me here. (thanks for last night by the by... man.. was I filling up the cup's of butt angst)  So.. yah.. my friends and family are a huge sunshine spot in my life.  Also.. I have my major hobbie. Which is RPGin'. I will admit NO SHAME in this. I love roleplaying games. I'm not one of those creepy obsessed with RPG's and will do nothing but. I mean I like nature hikes, reading, writeing, watching the more-than-ocasional-movie. But I've invested alot of time and cash in to RPG's and I have so much fun playing them.. and running them. Mostly running them.. I just get this buzz when I run a game... as long as I can see the players enjoying themselves.  Other good things.  My cats! I love my Cats! Oz, Shade, and Pook... The three amigos.. or.. two amigos and an amiga... or one amigo... one amiga... and one sexually confused cat.... or something like that. These three furry friends allways make me smile. Even when Shade is in Heat.. or Oz's is being a jerk... They allways come to me when I'm blue and cheer me up... A shimmy on who ever says animals lack soul. These guys know when I'm sad.. and actually make an effort to cheer me up. You can actual see the emotion reflected back at you from these guys. I don't really look at them as pets... more like...  Lazy Friends whom I have chosen to provide for.  What else? Well. there is my own personal spiritual oneness.. But I don't want to get in to that.. it will turn in to a rant.. and no one wants an ranting Josh with a religious bone to pick.  I am sure there are other things that make my life good. But those are the key points... So when it boils down to it.. Friends, Family, Fun, and... Fuzzies?  or... so that last bit makes me sound like i'm in to some kinda suit wearing fetish...  and with that. Later! -Josh
