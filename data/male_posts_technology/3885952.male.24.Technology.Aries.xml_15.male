I've also used wasoupy which the WA coming from the state code for Washington State. Souperman was another one i used, but too many thought of that. i am a man of many handles. this is funny. im talking about nothing and making perfect sense. well in my head atleast. "i know the lines crooked on paper, but i swear i got 'em straight in my head." hehe. well i'm running low on thoughts (for once) so i'll just make this look long by putting some funny quotes i read the other day:  "Right now I'm having amnesia and deja vu at the same time. I think I've forgotten this before."  "I wrote a song, but I can't read music so I don't know what it is. Every once in a while I'll be listening to the radio and I say, "I think I might have written that."  "If you can't hear me, it's because I'm in parentheses."  "Everywhere is walking distance if you have the time."  "I went to a restaurant that serves "breakfast at any time." So I ordered French Toast during the Renaissance."  "I went to a general store. They wouldn't let me buy anything specifically."  "I hate it when my foot falls asleep during the day because that means it's going to be up all night."  "I was trying to daydream, but my mind kept wandering."  "I spilled spot remover on my dog. He's gone now."  "When I was a baby, I kept a diary. Recently, I was rereading it. It said, "Day 1 -- Still tired from the move. Day 2 --Everybody talks to me like I'm an idiot."  "My grandfather invented Cliff's Notes. It all started back in1912... Well, to make a long story short ..."  hehe...ok hope all is well with all of you. Adios.
