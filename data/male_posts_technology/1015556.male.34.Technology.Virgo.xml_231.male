He mentioned that he was at this conference for young adult minstries and met  urlLink Mark Batterson  from  urlLink NCC  in DC.  This is a church that I have followed on and off for a little while, since they are in DC and I love their whole approach.  I asked T what he was like and he said, "You know, hes in his mid 30s, has a few kids.  He's just like us." That's funny.  The idea that a pastor could be just like me, it's weird and different because of my experience as a young Christian.  But I think it's right.  And I'm glad my thinking is changing.
