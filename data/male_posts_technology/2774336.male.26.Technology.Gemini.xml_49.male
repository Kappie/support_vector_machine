 Seeing my aunt and uncle again was great!  They both look very well.  My aunt has dyed her hair blonde now, and my uncle's dark hair and beard is about half grey and very distinguished. 

 I didn't eat much at the reunion, just a few pretzels and carrots.  When I got home at 8:00 pm I had a couple slices of the orange cranberry bread and the other half of the soy yogurt.  I also took a quarter dose of Citrucel and a vitamin.  I likely wont eat again until almost 10:00. 

  Update:  My intestines are crampling and gurgling slightly. 

  Update:  Wow!  The soy cheese melts really well!  I'd say even better than real cheese! No oily puddles when I melted the "Veggie Shreds" mozzeralla substitue over some Ritz crackers.  Great! 

 My intestines are still tight and gurgling a little (at 10:17 pm). 

  Update:  I'm getting nausiated with high bloating and belching, similar to last night.  The only thing I didn't eat the same tonight is the fish, but I had more cheese and crackers tonight.  Is it the bread or the cheese?  Or doesn't it matter...
