I have an article why the Americans celebrate thanks giving during the 4th thursday in November  On the fourth Thursday in November, Americans celebrate Thanksgiving. We have a special meal and give thanks for our blessings. This tradition began with the first European settlers in North America as a celebration of the harvest in 1621. Some of the foods included in the meal are turkey, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, and pumpkin pie.   What about Vijay? Has he become the sole propreitor of Patni.  Bye for now
