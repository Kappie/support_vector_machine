I wondered why, think it's because I'm starting to let things get more and more messed up when it comes to prioritising work and play. I guess that's what happens, people who manage their time well will always have time for everything. Whereas once I let myself get too disorganised, I will always find that I'm fighting time all the time.  Actually I did have a lot of things I wanted to blog about. But I may not recall everything now.   Aikido @ Siglap   Siglap CC saw a new student. A Japanese (national I think), by the name of Sakai. He's a judo yudansha, but I'm not aware of which dan. Was told he seems stiff but haven't quite seen his training much yet to know what that means exactly. Leon still as slack as ever. Tang came down to watch our training (he couldn't join in coz of the indemnity notice everyone need to sign during training) and commented on Richard's style. He uses a lot of Ki extension (as Yuishinkai would term it). I went down to Pillars Youth for training on Mon. Very shiok. Just need to get used to being around an all malay training ground. But I have to admit it felt really nice. Everyone was so friendly. In general even the white belts practice a lot more harder and have better ukemi than those I've seen in BV. I'm seriously thinking of transferring from BV over to Pillars for a few mths. One, coz the distance from work is so much nearer. Two, I feel damn uncomfortable not paying mat fees and training at BV every Tues. At least at Pillars, I'm paying $5 for each visit. I dunnoz lah, see how lor. Don't think I want to stop Siglap/ARCC trainings anytime soon. ARCC maybe far but I always have ample time.  Anyway, next week is going to be weapons class. Gotta remember my bokken then. Realised my bokken seems like it's cracking liao. Wah, seriously man, the ki my bokken experiences with Yuishinkai is taking its toll on my poor bokken. Hahah ... never mind lah, can buy a new one if it breaks.   Friendster   Friendster seems to be up again, but still as unreliable as ever. Got a message from someone but when I checked my inbox, I couldn't find a thing. Ridiculous lah, think Friendster did something . Anyway I dunnoz, forget it. Was checking through the testimonials in some groups I joined and realised that some of my earlier posts had been deleted. Let's not finger-point, and it is their perogative too. I'm more concerned about how Friendster is turning out. If we are only concerned with keeping the nice testimonials about ourselves, I think you might as well email a nice essay to your friend and ask them to post it on Friendster instead. As Neo once put it, it's all about clocking up good testimonials of yourself and that is so besides the point. I guess that's a reason why I don't log in to friendster much anymore. I do find it kinda pointless these days.   Aikido @ ARCC   Yesterday's training at ARCC was good. What always strikes me at the end of class is that I've learnt something about the way warmups relate to our techniques. We don't relate warmups to trainings almost 80% of the time. Even when something is said, it's only a few sentences. Yuishinkai will have a Ki class where they tell you why warmups are like this, how to relate it to your technique and what you should be feeling during the warmups itself. Slowly when we go on to techniques, they fit in nicely. Of coz applying it is a whole new ball game lah. We were doing the rowing exercise with a jo and I finally understood what I need to do or feel.  Holding the jo horizontally with both my hands with my foot in left stance. I lean my body forward and try to maintain stability still. Note not to overstretch myself. As I lean, my hands (with jo) automatically raises upward a little. As I pus out with my hands, I need to do it in a downward motion and hard enough to feel the skin on the back of my neck being stretch and 'trembling' a bit due to the force of the push. When pushing arms down, note not to loose balance due to overstretching. As I lean body back, arms will raise a bit to an almost hotrizontal arc. As I pull my arms back to my hips, I should be following the ki in which my fingers are pointing. When done without a jo, uke will feel that they are not able to hold back the force of this pushing and pulling motion.   Home   Finally cleared junks of old toys and clothes by getting teh Salvation Army to pick them up on Fri afternoon. Woohoo ... room got more space now. I'm 1 step closer to getting my loft bed. Next thing I need to do is saw up a old cupboard of mine into small chunks and getting rid of it. I don't knwo whe I can or should do this though. Need to plan my time a bit. Folks came back from Thailand yesterday afternoon. Dad had a swoolen knee, dunno why. Mom had a swoolen foot. Heard them mention something about being old and taking too much of a certain food. We are what we eat, that's for sure. Sis was home then so I asked her if they mentioned anything about us donating so many new (but unworn clothes) to ther Salvation Army. She said they made a heckuva ruckus when I wasn't around but nothing they can do about it now. Muahahaha ... my idea of Xian1 Zhan3 Hou4 Zou4 worked brilliantly. Anyway, I tried to appease them by just walking over to show them the whole series of Yi3 Tian1 Tu2 Long2 Ji4 (Heaven Sword and Dragon Sabre) I purchased few days ago. Watched about 3 VCDs lastnight and I think they were hooked liao. Watched another VCD today. Probably after lunch can watch a few more. Muahahaha ... think it's the start of me getting a whole series of those oldies HK TV series like Shen2 Diao1 Xia2 Lu3 and Lu4 Ding3 Ji4. Shiok man.   Friends   Steff will be coming to Singapore next week with some friends from Uni. Heard she's starting a PhD in Brum soon too. Good for her. I think I better do some research on where she can visit for 4 days or so. I can only suggest eating and eating hahaha.  James's wedding dinner at the Singapore Marriot Hotel was good. You can tell he really loved the day. Good to see him settle down at last. Met up with Shuhua, Wanloong and Yvonne that night too. Was nice to see familar faces again.
