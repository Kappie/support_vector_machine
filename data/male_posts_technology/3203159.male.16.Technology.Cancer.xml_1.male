I feel justified in having an account now, considering this is beta and as it is, it is my duty to help better the application.  My summer plans have gone well today, as I feel my plans are going into process, such as the damned Honors work I must do.  I have discovered that when I listen to a song with a beat I like, I tend to thrust my fist towards my monitor and bang on my desk and underneath my monitor.  I've actually produced some pretty nice sounding and complicated drum beats.  Anyways, back to subject.  I've been working on the Reviuss logo.  Everyone knows it's a damn V.  But it is a very nice looking V, it doesn't look exactly like a V.  Why can't people assume it's just a neat arrow-looking object.  Accept that!  There is a good discussion going on in my forums about psychology and philosophy, finally the boards are running with . . well, some sort of intelligence.  http://rev.shadonet.com/forums
