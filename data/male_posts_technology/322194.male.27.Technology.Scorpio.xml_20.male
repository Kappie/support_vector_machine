Being an IT person working for a company that strives to be at the cutting edge of technology, this is excellent news. Now, if only hardware companies can get the systems to actually  transmit data  at those kinds of speeds, we'd be doing pretty good.   Tales of Symphonia  is getting some  urlLink excellent review scores , as most of  urlLink Namco's  products do. I don't really care one way or the other. If it had received nothing but 1's and 2's as scores, I'd still be getting it. I've been aching to play a good RPG on my Cube, and nothing so far has been able to get me there. Here's hoping  Baten Kaitos  fairs just as well. These two games alone could keep me busy until the next generation begins.  Just prior to posting this, I received a new message from Microsoft's  urlLink Hotmail staff . Looks like the spector of  urlLink Google's gMail  is scaring Microsoft into providing more service for free. Check this out:  We're rolling out email antivirus protection as well as enhanced storage to help meet your growing needs. This will make MSN Hotmail, a world class email service that both scans and cleans ingoing and outgoing email for viruses and worms before they enter your inbox.      In addition to delivering world-class antivirus protection, you can also look forward to an upgrade in your storage capacity. In fact, you'll receive 125 times your current email storage with the introduction of a 250 MB inbox as well as the ability to send attachments up to 10 MB.     250 MB?!   While that's a far cry from Google's 1 GB gMail offering, it's plenty more than the paltry 2 MB they provide now. I'm looking forward to it. As it is now, I delete far too much email. I've been looking for an opportunity to keep my junk mail for just a few days longer.  In comic news, I've decided to honor the occasion of the return of the  urlLink Evil Network Comics Listing  with a combined return of the Online Comic Weekly Spotlight  (formerly known as the  urlLink Pick of the Week ) . Now, while  Arshraam  isn't around here anymore  (actually, come to think of it, I have no idea where he might be) , I'll be taking care of the Weekly Spotlight myself. I'll probably call in some favors with friends to help with choosing the right comics to be Spotlighted upon, and I'll warn you when things are coming around. The Spotlight will be posted on the  urlLink comics site , but as with all things Evil Network, it will be mentioned here, first. Consider this to be the "homepage" for the network, with every other sites merely connecting dots.  I went to the doctor today hoping I might get my pins out of my hand, but no luck. At least another two weeks, he says. In any case, I'm typing this two-handed, and it's getting much easier to do. I may just have to go full-bore and throw in  Viewtiful Joe , just to really see if my hand is useable.  Maybe not.  Later kids...
