Am I doing the right thing? Am I just fooling myself until she finds out she doesn't want me? Do I want her? Should I ask her out? Will she say yes? Do I want her to say yes? Should I continue looking? Do I want/need to continue looking? Is there such a thing as a good ending? Who am I? Where am I? What should I be doing? What do I want to do?   Inner strugglings... peace- Tim
