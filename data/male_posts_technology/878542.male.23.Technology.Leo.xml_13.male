Without proper safeguards, our state is in danger of becoming a pure democracy."  ~former majority leader Ken Garn, of Utah  Now, doesn't that just keep you awake at night? The idea that citizens might someday play a part in their own lives?   You better believe it keeps some far-sighted politicians up at night, realizing their influence and control of the law might not be iron-clad in a society where citizens make law by initiatives. Or even expect more input in how the law is handled. Dangerous times, my friends, dangerous times...
