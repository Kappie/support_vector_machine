Pretty cool, it's very flattering.  When we both read the email, we were like, "Who, us?"  Anyway, it's a pretty neat opportunity and not that we are experts.   Here is a snippet of what he wrote to us.  "...seen in you a commitment to being a God honoring parent and one who knows the difference some encouragement and a few new ideas can make." It sounds fun and like it could really be a great thing in very tangible terms.  We are totally going to help out.
