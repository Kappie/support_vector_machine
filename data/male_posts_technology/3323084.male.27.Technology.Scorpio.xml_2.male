Remember that I live in Arkansas and not California, I paid  $1.959  per gallon.  I drive an hour to and from my job and that adds up to a lot of gas, 60-70 dollars a week.  That's a big chunk of my well deserved pay check!  And it only looks to be getting worse, I figure that at the rate gas is going, it's only going to be another week until I'm paying over  $2.00  a gallon.  I know that it's worse in some parts of the country, but the cost of living and the pay scale here is much lower too.  I was watching MSNBC and saw bit about the major US oil makers, they are all reporting high earnings this year, some as high as  90 percent  gains this year.   I'm outraged!    How on earth can they be earning so much if not for making a huge profit on gas. It just makes me angry.  And I've been thinking that with elections coming up in November that Washington would put some pressure on them to not price gouge us so badly.  I remember hearing some time back about the government looking into what was causing the gas prices to go up so steeply, but I don't know what happened with that.  I know that the price per barrel of oil has gone up some, but not at the same proportion as the price of gas, so what gives.  I think the gas manufactures have found an excuse that most of us would buy into to raise prices really high. Making them some really big profits, and that's the reason why the price is so high.  I have no doubt that gas would have gone up as the barrel of oil goes up, but not as high as it is right now.  As of right now, the price of a barrel of oil, (from a google search), is about  $37  a barrel.  I would like to see one of the Presidential hopefuls come up with a good solution to this problem for the upcoming presidential election, I think I'd have to give serious consideration in voting for the one that I thought had the best fix for the problem. After all, this problem effects the whole US economy and needs to be dealt with.  Anyway, the whole gas price thing just makes me mad.  Until next time...
