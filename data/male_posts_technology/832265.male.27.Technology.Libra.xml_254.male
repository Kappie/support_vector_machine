It's worth noting to all the "Yankees buy their championships" haters that:  Well, this is just demonstrably true, isn't it?  The Red Sox tried to do the exact same thing but couldn't get it done.  So thhbbtt.  
The NYT has a great  urlLink account  of the financials behind the deal which are pretty fascinating.  One tidbit: The Yankees also got Rodriguez to defer an additional $1 million a year for each of the first four years with no interest. They offset that reduction in value by giving Rodriguez a hotel suite on the road (an old players' perk) and allowing him to link his Web site to the Yankees' Web site (a new perk). I like the fact the being in someone's blogroll has become a part of business negotiations.
