Making a bit of ruckus but still within acceptable limits. One is feeling like really drunk right now and he's gone to bed (at 6pm heh heh). He tried to make me drink 1 shot on his behalf but I stood by my ground. No compromise when it came to drinking alcohol.  OK lah, last week was siongest week for me but also quite glad that it's all over. Tues I had 1 last supervisor meeting. It was a group meeting in which they went through all the key points expected in a good report. Was really helpful. One very impt point he mentioned was that if we felt that we did pretty bad for the program, the marks would really count in a report. I've got 2 wks to get it done. Wed I had my Jap test. Basically listening and written. Wasn't terribly difficult just wasn't really a walkover. I prob won't do well but I think (hope)  I might be able to clear it.  Night came and I went for Aikido (also after having been skipping it for quite sometime). It was the last class in Uni. Again I brought down the ideo cam but I really didn't manage to get much good footage. And worst, most footage I captured was at a really bad and odd angle. Think I'll probably get more footages in my coming 3 classes thiss holiday. We did variations of kokyu nage. Started gyaku hamni katatedori with the normal tenkan turn and throw, followed by a ryotedori tenkan and throw. There was one in ai hamni as well. All these led on to the final variation. The last one we did was with 2 persons, each grabbed an arm with a 2 handed grab. Still kokyu nage and it was an immense test for coordinating both left and right hands. Sensei pointed out something to me tonight. That I needed to respond with much more confidence "You're a 5th kyu now and going onto 4th. Gone were the days where you wait and pause before you perform the technique." I accepted her gracious comment and I keep reminding myself to practice as she had said now.  Basically that evening there was only 6 students. John, Yannis, me, and the beginners were 'Magik' (think that's how his name is spelt), and a couple; Alex and Rachel Royal. Gotta comment on these 2. They are really friendly and nice folks prob about 30+ yrs old. Alex is quite stiff but he's trying hard, especially with his ukemi. He get really tired and breathless sometimes a bit too soon. Rachel always like to grab me as her uke/nage. She says she like me not throwing her as hard as some would I think. Haha ... something I really should be working on correcting.  At the end of class, I took a dojo photo. Will try to post it online somewhere this holiday. We ended about 30 mins early and went to Staff House for a chat and a drink. Had a cup of coke and some chips. It was an enjoyable get together. Sensei shared some insight into the character of Chiba Sensei. He's a very hard and formal budo man. She said something about a 'love-hate' thing. You either love or hate the guy really. Very very domineering person who knows exactly what he wants. Eerything he asks of you may seem hard/tough. But the things he expects from you, he's already done it and gone beyond that. However much and hard you think you're doing, he's done it much more and much harder. However much you've pushed, he's done that before as well and beyond. That's why I think he has such expectations. But he really is a very nice man. He has a many students but he really isn't the type that most of them would have a relationship with. I think it's something like when I was serving my BMT. Some Sgt don't expect to get too close to the recruits so as to maintain the line of command and all that. A lot of people has mentioned to my Sensei that she has a very good relationship with Chiba Sensei which I agree as well. I've not seen them together but I think she's like one of his closer students. In fact 3 wks from now, he'll drop by (on his way to France) and will be staying 2 days at my Sensei's place. Heard he loves to fish and my Sensei is staying near a really nice fishing area.  Fri came and I had my 30 min demo. Both the lecturers were late. I was quite panicky about it. Slept about 3 hrs (though I actually intended to grab a nap of juz 30 mins) the night before while still working on some last min stuff. The lecturers were quite decent about the whole thing and I think things went a lot better than I deserved. I had to mention that I didn't use any 3rd party software to do my VRML geometic productions and I think that realy scored some small point with them. The overall product isn't too fantastic though. After my report is done, I'll try to setup a webpage where I can put my project up.  Anyway, got home. Took a nap and got up for a run. Manage to feel my stamina coming back then as well. Prob do more runs this holiday and some swimming. Will still be going to Uni to get most of my studying done. Night I think I'll work on my VR module project (diff from my FYP). Basically model a Jap looking dojo which may double as a Virtual dojo online. If anyone has any ideas about what I can put inside, I'm pretty open to suggestions. I'm definitely going to put in video clips for viewing.  Sat came, went to get groceries in the morning, tried to revive the server but to no avail. Hdd looks like it's goin soon. Looks very unstable now. Anyway my housemate decided to use her laptop as the server but that means that we can't go online after she's gone to bed because she refuses to on her laptop 24/7.  Oops, I failed to mention that after my project demo, I went to grab a G.I. hair cut. No. 1 on the back and sides. Kewl man. But freaking cold when the cold wind blows (hmm isn't that a song?).
