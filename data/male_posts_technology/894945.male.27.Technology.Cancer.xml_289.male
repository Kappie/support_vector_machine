I mean the Havana Club. I know! I know! But hang on.. I was really drunk and.. ok, I know there's no excuse.. but we were in Follies and really bored and somebody that shall remain nameless (Franki) said we should go "just for a laugh".  As it happens, it was OK.. it's actually pretty big, which I didn't know, and has a stage on which you can bop around to Bryan Adams or the Sluttybabes or whatever crappy commerical shite the DJ occasionally throws on. Yes, there were some scary women in there - but it was a surprisingly mixed crowd. There was the odd honey mixing around with the MILFS, which was a very welcome sight. It just seems to be the place for people that are too bored/old/normal for Follies. I would still rather go there than Cosmopolitan.. and don't give me that crap about  "But you haven't seen the show, Toaster.. it's SO FUNNY. There's guys, that wear MAKE UP and dresses and do dances and songs and stuff!"  I don't give a fuck. Gay doesn't bother me at all. Camp and scary bothers me.  Plans are afoot for the christmas Toaster Files night out. Danger has had a STUNNING idea, sure to chaos lots of chaos and liver abuse. I'm not going to reveal the details at this early stage.. just get those TF shirts ironed boys, because it's a going to be a long, drunken december...
