Many things happened to me during the past couple of days, some were nice and some were shit.    Shit No. 1   I'm not able to find a job. This is so frustrating... It is known today that if a person, specially an Arab one, no matter how talented he is and no matter what he knows and what he don't, i f he don't have any favoritism or "influence" he'll never be able to integrated in the market. We the Arabs are seen as a second, maybe third priority. We don't serve the Army, our parents didn't, we are not Jewish.. We are sooooo screwed.    Shit No. 2   I forgot all about Ruba. I wish i didn't.. But i can't keep on missing her. It was so damn good and fun with her, she is an amazing person. What happened between the two of us? Only Ruba and god knows, though i doubt it the god knows. I guess the good memories are the only thing that is left of her.  Enough with the shit...  let's GET BUSY BABY  I got back home from a  kick ass  night. Me and the guys went to Tibirias for swimming and BBQ. Nizar brought his speed boat, Anan his Jet ski, and so we had a great time. It was one of the most hilarious nights ever. Since Nizar, Zacky and Nazeeh got married we don't get to meet that much. Naseem is in Eilat most of his time, Mario is getting engaged tomorrow- just to satisfy and to serve his father's desire, Crazy thing ha?- Morad is totally fucked up, so it's me, Maroon, Roni, Esam and Anan know. I miss the old days very much. We used to travel the world a lot together and go out looking for chicks and getting drunk. LOL  I'm building my own site know, i'm thinking of something big and very impressive. It'll give me some good practice for what i have studied in the college and satisfy my arrogant.  One last thing before i close.. I met this person on the net, she is from Nazareth, an Arab of course. She attained amazing me. I mean though being an Arab she is so opened in sex talks and whatever might come out of it. She loves to explore herself in sex, she is never shy to talk about it, and don't give a fuck of what people might say about her. She is a virgin, and she manages very well keeping her reputation and fame clean. She is amazing, just amzazing.  It's 4:00 Am now and i better go to sleep now.
