They are expensive, the upcoming  urlLink referendum in Vancouver  is going to cost upwards of a million dollars and it isn't about a terribly urgent subject.  The issue is whether or not to move the current  urlLink at large system  to a  urlLink wards based system .  Any time the public is given a chance to have a say it is a good thing.  Spending money to ask the people what they think is worthwhile.  Everyone should get educated on this issue and have their voice heard by voting.  I encourage politicians at all levels of government to ask us what we think more often.
