I was discussing it last night with Hubcap, and he looked puzzled. Turns out he had never heard the phrase "take a flying fuck at a rolling donut." This gave me pause. Is this a southern/country saying? Have the rest of you never heard it as well? Have you actually reached the ripe old age of *mumblemumble* without ever telling anyone to take a flying fuck at a rolling donut? Please report.  The next assignment will be: creek/brook/branch? What do you call it?
