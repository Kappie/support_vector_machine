Anyhow after tossing around several restaurant names, we ended up at Fazoli's(a fast food Italian joint) who's breadsticks rival if not conquer those of Olive garden. Well, as we stood in line waiting to place our orders, there was an employee behind the counter who appeared to be somewhat frustrated with the way "his" night was going. Although it was quite entertaining, this individual was essentially throwing a temper-tantrum and showing out in front of the customers which is probably not that good for business. The guy had to be in his late thirties so I can understand his self-disappointment at being "Breadstick Boy", but his Diva attitude was almost enough to make me lose my appetite. While making his rounds later on it seemed as though he had gotten himself under control(maybe went out back and had a good cry) until he served us our 2nd helping of breadsticks after which he huffed off mumbling something along these lines..."I can't believe my basket is empty 2 tables into the dining room"... On our way out he was hurriedly refilling his basket, half destroying the breadsticks with his tongs. We got to the theater an hour early so when we went in, it was pitch black. However, I just happen to have a keychain flashlight that illuminated the whole theater. We made our way to our seats and played games on our cell phones to pass the time. Suddenly we heard some more people coming in talking about how dark it was. Blackout. We closed our phones and killed the keychain light. It sounded like little kids that weren't gonna walk any further than the front row. Out of nowhere I hear one of the guys making haunting ghost sounds. Those kids were GONE like the wind!
