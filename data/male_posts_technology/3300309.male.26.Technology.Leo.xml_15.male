A three foot long  metal projectile is launched from a cannon at up to 3 per minute reaching speeds  up to Mach 7. Many miles away, six minutes later, it starts raining metal  blocks.          Pretty impressive stuff, but also the possibilty  for friendly fire is quite frightening. There you are, minding your own  business and you get flattened by a supersonic metal slab.          I can only assume they play the theme to 2001 A  Space Odyessy on approach....          Here's the article.           http://www.popsci.com/popsci/aviation/article/0,12543,636378,00.html
