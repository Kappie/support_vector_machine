PS: abusrd, we are talking about  urlLink invisible tabs  here.  GoogleGuy says :-  I thought it was really, really funny. Nice to see people taking google back to the future. :) Has anyone seen Danny Sullivan's slide ("google in 2010", or something like that)? It's a google front page with like 30 tabs. Also pretty funny..
