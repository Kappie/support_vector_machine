When we arrived it looked big and messy but just about surfable, there were a few guys who had just left the water too. We decided to pitch the tent and get a quick surf in before dark. Big mistake. It took us over an hour to get the tent up! In the end we just jammed the supporting sticks into the ground and secured the tent with a few pegs :) It did the job. By that stage it was dark so we got a fire going and cooked a few burgers.   In the morning we managed to get a little surf in at the Freke, everywhere else was flat really. It wasn't exactly inviting but we thought we'd go for a splash anyway. Some of the lads headed to Castlegregory after that but I had to head back to Cork for a party. They got a surf in at Dumps the next day  Sunday was a gorgeous day, a bit windy but really sunny. The wind was blowing onshore at Garrettstown but the waves were only just over a foot so it was still ok for a mess around. Got some nice little waves but the swell really dropped off later in the day.   Garrettstown is really starting to look like some beach resort in England with several chipper vans and donkey rides on the beach! Good to see some life around though, there must have been around 30 body-boarders in the shallows. You'd wonder how many will carry on and take it up seriously? One, two?   The lifeguards are moving in next weekend, and will be around every weekend until July when they move in full time. That's when you know you can leave your board behind! Still, there's always those rogue swells that hit us every now and then. Lets hope it's a good summer!    Cormac Heads Home.  urlLink      Garrettstown Sunday.  urlLink
