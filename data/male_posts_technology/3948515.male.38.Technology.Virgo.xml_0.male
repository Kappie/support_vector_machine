Basically, this allows you to create Virtual Machines having virtual hard-drives that can host 'guest' operating systems.  This means that you can for example run Windows 98 and 2000 on an XP Pro machine without having to go through the pain of partitioning the hard-drive and installing the Operating Systems in the correct order.  I've installed and use it often and have to say it is definitely worth it's $129 so go and have a play with the 45 day trial, I don't think you will regret it.
