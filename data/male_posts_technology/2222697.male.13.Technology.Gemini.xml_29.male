I got home played around for 45 min then went to dinner at chick-fil-a. After that i waited in line for an hour and i got to see it. A word of warning first, it is really long. I crashed after the movie. There are huge battle scenes which is 1/3 of the movie and since it was opening day there was alot of useless clapping and stuff but it was fun to be around fanatics like me. It was simply heaven for me. I took 2 exams today that were not hard at all. Im really bored but i will find something to do. I feel like going to gamestop and getting viewtiful joe or something. Yeah i'm going to do that.
