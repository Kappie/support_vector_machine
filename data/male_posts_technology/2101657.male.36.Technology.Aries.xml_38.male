I was supposed to go help assist with some training at the local district Scout Camp for OWL (Outdoor Webelos Leader) and Baloo (Basic Adult Leader Outdoor Orientation). Well, that didn't happen. I felt bad as there was no way for me to contact them to let them know, since the leader I was going help was there Friday evening already.  I woke up about 4am, and already didn't start feeling very well. I realized later, that I had already started feeling bad the evening before when we went out to eat, and I was starting to feel extremely tired.  Well, I had my clock set to go off at 7:15, which would have given me time to get my clothes together, cleaned up, and on the road. I had already packed my tent, sleeping back, a chair, and a few other things in the trunk of the car the night before.  By 7:30, I had started to throw up.  Oh that’s such a joyful experience. I won’t go into details about what else was happening, but needless to say I spent a lot of time in the bathroom.  That continued during the whole day.  I napped for about a half-hr or so, and just couldn't seem to quite get any actual rest. So about 4, laying on the couch, hips starting to ache like I had a case of the flu, I had the boys throw "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" in the DVD player. We have it on loan from my parents.  It's an interesting movie. It's not the greatest movie in the world, but it was a fun watch.  Some of the plot lines are more then paper thin, and I was able to anticipate what was going to happen, quite easily before it did.  The boys seemed to enjoy it though, and they seemed to like the special effects. Personally, I while I thought the Sub of Capt. Nemo's was very impressive; it was completely wrong/inaccurate to what is described in the classic "20,000 leagues under the Sea".  Plus, I never realized that Capt. Nemo was from India. Go figure.  By this time, I had started to sip on some Kool-Aid, as I was dehydrating very fast.  I also had some chicken noodle soup, sans noodles. That was all I had to eat.  Sunday I felt better for the most part, some more energy, hips still aching though.  I had some actual food type food that day.  I've been slowly getting myself to eating more daily, but it's still taking some time to get my appetite back.    I've spent some of our tax return myself finally, and can't wait for the items to get here.  I ordered the 19 inch monitor that I've been wanting for ages. It should arrive in a day or two.  That will make it easier on Z*lda, since the 17 is hard to see text on for her.  It shouldn't be much different in size than our 17 inch monitor now, as it's a Nokia from 2000, so it's on the big side.  That will go down to our youngest son so he'll have something better then a 15 to work on.    I've also made it official and have become a card carrying member of the Star Trek Fan club! This is the part that cool to me. I've wanted to join the fan club for years, and finally have.  It's $30 to join, and for joining up, if you pay the $6.50 shipping, you get a $20 lithograph for free (is anything truly free?).  So I ordered another lithograph to go with it, that shows the Enterprise NX-01 in space next to a planet.  Just wondering where I can put that up, w/o being too obnoxious about Trek :-)  I almost got the Captain Proton one, which is from Star Trek: Voyager. It's based on a "serial" type story line in the holodeck that Lt. Paris and Ensign Kim use. Think of the old Tom Swift/Flash Gordon matinee's from the 30's/40's and you'll have it.    School is getting close to being done, and I can't wait.  Taking two classes, while being so active in scouts, and work, and trying to have a life just runs you down.  I have some research to do, as I'm going to be writing a paper on the topic, that if it should be required to have a license to have children or not.  I thought it would be an interesting topic, as I can easily and readily see how the argument could go both ways.  You have to have a license to drive a car, so why not to have kids? Seems to make sense.
