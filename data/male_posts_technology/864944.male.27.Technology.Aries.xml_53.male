Whales are cool, and we did manage to see a few (about 3-4).  One was a  urlLink Sei Whale  which decided to hang around and give us plenty of close looks.  (no picutures sorry).   We also saw the obligatory  urlLink humpback .  All that was very nice, and would have made for a successful whale watch.  But the REAL kicker of this one, was the sighting of a  urlLink Basking Shark .  These are actually pretty rare to see, and we got to check him out for a while.  Ours was also a rather large one (prolly 25 feet ).    My pics are ok.. not great.  But you'll get it :)    urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/ShareLandingSignin.jsp?Uc=4aa2nef.7t12042n=-ynj2al=BrowsePhotos.jsp%3fshowSlide%3dtrue=0
