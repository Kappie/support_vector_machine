I am pretty sure that I am the only person in the grandstands this evening who had a collar on my shirt, let alone a Polo shirt with a colar.  For the un-initiated, I live in a very blue collar corner of the world.  Southeast Iowa, USA, is in the heart of the old manufacturing rust belt, and the rich agricultural corn belt.  In no way am I bashing this kind of thing, it is very necessary, in fact vital to the world economy that the people that live here do what they do;  farm or work in a factory of some sort.  The majority of US exports of soybeans and good percentage of corn exports come from Iowa;  every Case Backhoe in the world at one time came through the Case (now Case-New Holland) plant in Burlington.  The world still very much needs welders, mechanics and farmers- it would be a very different place without them.  My point is that sometimes I wonder what I am doing here.  Tonight at the races I am pretty sure that I was the only one there who can write html, understand how the internet really works, can configure a router or even knows what a switch is.  I am definitely a minority here... so if you live in Southeast Iowa and know anything about network technology, please email me- im feeling a little isolated...
