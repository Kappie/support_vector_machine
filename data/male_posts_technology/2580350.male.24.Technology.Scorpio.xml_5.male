There was mention of a sequel never been able to out shine the original movie (except Toy Story 2) and that the characters had gone stale from the first movie. The reviews also projected donkey as the mean animal who won’t understand Shrek and his newly wed wife’s feelings.  So I didn’t have many expectations while going into the movie. But the review writer was completely wrong.   The movie is more hilarious than the first one. Although the characters have more or less remained the same but the surprise package was Puss in the Boots. I’ll leave it to you to watch the movie to figure it out how stylish and cute he is. And 100 points for guessing who is paying the voice in the background. Because once you guess that, you’ll immediately fall in love with the character.  The donkey is as stupid as he can be and nothing much has changed so I am sure if you liked him in the first part, performance in this one will not disappoint you. Shrek is the usual stubborn guy but in this movie it is shown that the only thing that can change a man’s (or an Ogre’s) stubbornness is the love of a lady.  Rest of the characters are also very refined and the instances of American things in the movie like Starbucks’, Mission Impossible clip etc. actually make the movie a fun to watch.  It is amazing how much the world of animation has improved as you are able to identify with the cartoon characters which used to be the case with actors and actresses on the screen. I think DreamWorks has already started working on Shrek 3 and 4 and looking at the second part, I am hopeful they can meet the high bar set by the first two parts.  I would definitely recommend the movie to the ones who have watched the first part and definitely to the ones who have not seen the first part.  For those who haven’t seen the first part, the leading lady is voiced by Cameron Diaz. In the first part the character had distinct similarity with the actress so it was easy to identify her voice. In this movie you’ll take some time to recognize her.  That’s all for now.
