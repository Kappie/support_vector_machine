     
      Why is it so hard to create a movie or television episode that gives me more than a few really good moments?  Why are writers so lazy that they expect me to fill in the blanks?  Why do writers receive so much notoriety not for being very careful and attentive to the story, but for succeeding in climbing awkwardly out of the corner into which they have painted themselves?  Always, always, always leave the party when everyone is having a good time.
