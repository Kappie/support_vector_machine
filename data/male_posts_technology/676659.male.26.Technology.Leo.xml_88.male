I used to think that way too, until some things brought back memories then you can't help but say, "I miss high school!" :)  Haaayyyy ... I really do miss high school. Althougth I do love college very much especially the freedom you have. Sigh. Very nostalgic gid when I think about HS. Miss ko man mga Worship Services every week sa school, before gina take for granted ko gid na during elementary and the early years of HS, but now I realize it's significance. Grabe gid pag nurture sina sa akon nga spiritual growth. Especially if you're feeling down, then Worship Service comes, and God would just use the speaker to speak to you ... and you just go back to God. In it's little way, I could call it personal revival. :) Thank you  urlLink Trinity Christian School  for being a part of my life. Wow, I know  Hao Tiu  would be very happy to read this. And no, I don't think this is cheesy! hehe ;)  Bon: Ssuuu-weeeeet! I want LCD monitor too, haaayyy... cge lang, as what Gemma's been telling me, I should be contented with what I have, cge, 17" monitor ko, ok na ko ni! hehe ;)   Anyway, I'll be leaving in 2 years, after ko graduate college my parents said they'll buy me a nu notebook and a professional digital camera when I get to Bible school. So I can wait. hehe Despite that, ma upgrade man ko next week MOBO, processor and more memory, so... yey!!! hehe :D  Gems: Hehe Mayo man tapos na ko sa JAVA! Thank you Lord! ;) Next year naman... so, ano na to thesis ta? Remember, we have 2 years to prepare and counting ... hehehe I do pray that you'll get through with your exams, I know you can do it, I have big confidence that you can. Dba Phil. 4:13! :) And sure, I can lend you the book sa Friday, anyway, I'm not done with the other one yet plus loads more in my shelf. hehe Isa-isahon ko lang anay ... I lurrrve books! haha You know if I was younger, I would take that statement back, pero not anymore! lol You know what, if that book is SO HARD to read, hmmm.... never mind! hehe Remember hambal ni Mommy Ruth, it's life-changing! Pero it's not the Bible naman, so you can shelve that ...  hehe Study ka lang anay ... :)  Edmar: 7 days .... and ma-graduate ka na! Congratulations!!! :D  Actually, I typed this blog entry yesterday at 6:11pm pa ... the advantages of using  urlLink w.Bloggar .... maka-save ka entry without posting it yet ;)
