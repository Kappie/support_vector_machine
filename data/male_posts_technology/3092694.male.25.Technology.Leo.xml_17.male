Did my ancestors anger the gods of all things tedious, thereby turning any task into a Sisyphean ordeal?  This bitching and wining stems from the fact that the Sloth's title graphic went down yesterday.  I have since shuffled said graphic through 3 different web site providers with mixed results.  In hope that either Blogger, or my service providers have decided to stop being little bitches I checked in on The Sloth moments ago to find that not only was the graphic missing, but also all of the text.   Bite me! (I'm fairly sure I the fuck up didn't happen on my end.  I think.)
