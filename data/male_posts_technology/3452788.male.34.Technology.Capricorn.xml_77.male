All the good feeling of the last few days had disappeared, and I can feel the weight of my thoughts taking hold, pulling me inexorably downward.  This sounds really pathetic and weak and self-defeating.  I don't care, welcome to the last 25 years of my life.  I am so unmotivated for work right now.  I really don't care a lot about anything other than getting better and improving my life.  I realize this fight against depression is the most important thing in my life right now.  I think that as long as I need to work, I will not have the energy I need to get better OR to be better at work.  I am beyond feeling guilty or stressed about work.  I am beyond wanting to move to another job.  I do feel pretty pathetic about the state of my career accomplishments.  I just feel like I am trapped by the paycheck, like so many other people.  I feel bad about having a well-paying job and having this problem.  I feel bad that I am wasting opportunity and talent fucking around at work, while other people with less opportunity and worse luck struggle to feed themselves and their families.  Kim says "why don't you just do something different?"  I could, but I am scared of failure, worried about the money, have a huge fkn mortgage, and so on.  What would we do while I decided to retool, retrain, and start from the bottom as a 34-yr-old rookie at something?  How can we possibly afford the life we have created if I am not earning the primary income?   What would I do?  I think I could write professionally, but it takes so much effort and perserverance and a little luck to get noticed.  Where do you start?  How do you get noticed?  There are a million people trying to be writers, what makes me think I could get chosen by someone?  I don't have any formal training in writing, or computer science, or biology, or wildlife, or mapping, or any of the things I would really enjoy.  It is possible I could find some sort of service job where I deal with one of those interests.  I am definitely at a cross-roads, but I am too afraid to take any side roads.  I used to be decisive and well-informed about potential decisions.  I feel like I have lost the ability to make big life-changing decisions, because I really just don't care.  I can see the boring, straight, smooth road ahead, the path of least resistance, that leads to either the mental hospital or worse.  I wish I knew how to break out of this.  I suppose this is partly depressive thinking, but this is also just being realistic about my life.  I am not making good decisions right now about anything.  I guess I will see if I can get better internally, then start working on career.  I can't wait for winter rain and cold.
