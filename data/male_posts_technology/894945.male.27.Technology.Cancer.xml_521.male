I've never even heard of it."  Unfazed, the blonde assures the pharmacist that she has been buying the stuff from this store on a regular basis, and would like some more.  "I'm sorry, we don't have any. We just have underarm deodorants."  "But I always get it here," says the blonde.  "Do you have the container it comes in?"  "Yes!" said the blonde, "I will go and get it."  About an hour later, she returns with the container and hands it to the pharmacist.  "Lady, this is just a normal stick of underarm deodorant!"  Annoyed, the blonde snatches the deodorant back and reads out loud from the package, "To apply, push up bottom... well?"
