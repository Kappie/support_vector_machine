That will be fun. Oh and the Silent Hill 3 OST is CRAZY GOOD so are the Silent hill 1,2, and 4 OST's. I love Akira Yamaoka and Melissa Williamson. They have been doing the Silent Hill OST's since the begining. At least Akira has Melissa Williamson only started on the Silent Hill 3 OST. She truly rocks in the Silent Hill 4 OST. They are damn good Soundtracks. Very addicting. I just bought them all. Good stuff.   I also have plans to go and buy Splinter Cell 2 today, possibly along with the first one. Thats all for now.
