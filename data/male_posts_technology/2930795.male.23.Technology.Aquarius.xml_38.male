The best feeling keyboard I have ever used before ( the apple extended keyboard) has been resurrected using the same mechanical keyswitches as the original.  This keyboard is huge and noisy, but has an excellent feel and keystroke depth.  They only give it a five year warranty, but at home the family has a couple of the adb originals that are well on their way to being adults(18 that is) and still working great.  If you are a mac user I strongly recommend that you get one of these
