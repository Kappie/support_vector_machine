Time seemingly begins to accelerate as we get older; this realization is a little frightening.  Colm and I did a little road trip yesterday after spending most of the day with Chris. We drove up to Santa Barbara. I have loved that place since I was seven. Every summer my family would spend a week up there. I just love the city. On the coast, about 85 miles north of Los Angeles. Temperatures are great throughout the year. Anyway, I digress...  We walked along the water, out onto the pier and just enjoyed each other's company. We then walked up State St and ate in one of the many bistros. I love this man with all my heart and am so grateful that he is in my life. He is funny, kind, gentle, compassionate, and so beautiful, on the inside, as well as the outside. I think about how devastated Chris is with the death of Drew. Ever feel guilty for having something that someone else whom you love has lost? That's describes a part of me right now. I confuse easily when shite happens.  On the ride back, I just enjoyed hearing Colm sleeping peacefully in the passenger seat. My heart swelled with love, pride, and admiration. Moments like these knock things into perspective. Hold your loved ones tightly and enjoy them!  Peace!
