Of course, with synthetic diamonds now  urlLink as good or better  than gemstone quality, this may not be as attractive as it used to be.  Kind of like what happened after they figured out how to electrolyze aluminum, which used to be more valuable than silver.  (The  urlLink cap of the Washington monument  is made of aluminum, which was then was a precious metal).
