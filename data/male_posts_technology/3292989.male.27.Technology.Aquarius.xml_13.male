As soon as you pass the speed of light, you start going back into time.  So one of my questions that they never answered is - So if I am picking up speed and all of the sudden I pass the speed of light, shouldn't I automatically go back to when I wasn't breaking the speed of light.  So really I could never break the speed of light.  Am I making any sense?  So after the discovery channel, went to the pool with the girls again, Tony and I went to Rockfish, hung out with my dad.  We had a talk, he finally listened to me I think.  Guess we will see.  Candice's engagement party was last night.  I took my camera, but didn't really know any one there.  So I did not take pics.     And for all ya'll out there that aren't sure which girl is right for you...   urlLink Mary-Kate or Ashley  that is, take this quiz so you'll know.
