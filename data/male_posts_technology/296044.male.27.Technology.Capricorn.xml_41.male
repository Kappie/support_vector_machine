Actually, all I updated were my current list of song suggestions. Not a hard job. Anyway, look for updates to my site in the coming days…            Oh! And, guess what else? I can send pictures to my blog now! Look for exciting porn soon. Kidding. Totally kidding. Not about uploading pictures, but about the porn.             urlLink http://home.columbus.rr.com/grandmasterj
