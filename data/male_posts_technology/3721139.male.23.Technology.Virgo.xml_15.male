And it looks like the block on my transcripts from AM is about to be lifted which will finally let me do something about my degree!    But I had a great night out last night.  Met a lot of random people which was a lot of fun.  Finished off that pack of Red Kamel's that I bought for the most dubious of reasons.  I woke up this morning with a moderate hangover, and was like "huh? work?" Hehehe.
