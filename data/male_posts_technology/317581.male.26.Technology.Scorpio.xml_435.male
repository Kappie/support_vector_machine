My "funny talking" is there.  I think it makes me come across as stupid. I think it causes some people to take pitty on me, while on others it makes them pissed off if I'm put into a leadership role ahead of them. Other people tend to think that I not know what I'm getting myself into, as if I couldn't understand it.   Sometimes I wonder if I sound like a down syndrome person. I know that women find me completely harmless, not that I mind. I would like a mutual attraction.   No matter where I go I take my achilles heel with me.  It is a constant reminder that no matter how hard I try at something, certain people will never take me seriously, and certain people will hate me. Certain people will try with all their might to protect me, as if I can't deal with something myself.  Do I look in the mirror and see a down syndrome baby?   I hate my speech impediment. Of course it helps when I look up speech impediment on google and it come up with:   urlLink 'Speech impediments may manifest as stutters or lisps or may be more severe. Severe speech impediments are relatively more common among people with cerebral palsy and can be associated with other physical disabilities or deafness. Relatively minor speech impediments may have a basis in a psychological disability or mental illness, but this should not be assumed.'   I guess this should mean that I'm more employable?  Anyway, I should go. I have the piano to practice. Peace-
