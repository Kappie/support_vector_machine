Coz I was watching the summer camp they had in 2000 and Tamura Sensei was 1 of the 4 instructors there. Can't remember what it was he was teaching but I think it had a lot to do with feeling uke. I think a lot of the yudanshas at the camp that he was correcting didn't quite get that as well. You can tell they weren't reacting very well a lot of times. Heh ... guess we're all learning. And I heard Tamura has like one of the longest warmups ever. Sensei Pauline was commenting that they planned him in a certain slot because they know that was one of his habits. Heh, sometimes he'd look at everyone there and say "Oh they don't need any rest." but actually may be some of them might think "Oh but we do" instead. XP A lot of Tamura Sensei's warmups I heard Sensei Pauline mention sounded really really familar to Freddy Sensei's, maybe that's where he picked them up from. Interesting. One more farny thing was that Pauline Sensei said sometimes Tamura Sensei would pretend that he didn't speak any English. Well it's kind of a tradition thing to have some kind of speech at the end of the camp and Pauline Sensei reminded Tamura Sensei a few times about it. Then I think after trying to act blur for quite awhile, he said "I'll give 1 if you'll give one." So my Sensei went up, clap her hands and said "Excuse me everybody, Tamura Sensei says that he has something he's just dying to tell you" XD~  Self-nikkyo? I know I can't do it. Best I can do is do more of those wrist training push ups instead. I'd like to try some koshinage and sumiotoshi though. Didn't do those much before but I think you'd most probably need to know some really proper breakfall if training with someone like me. Beginners in these techniques can't actually make it very painless for ukes. :P
