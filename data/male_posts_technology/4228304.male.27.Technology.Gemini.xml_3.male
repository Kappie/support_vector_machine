Looks like its I'm still not too used to this blogging stuff yet.  But guess wat? I'm beginning to think the Friday the 13th is not that bad after all! I've got my conversion from a contract staff to a permanent staff! Congratulate me!  BTW, its a lazy saturday which I simply do not have a bloody idea what am I going to do today. As a single, its definite that I would be pining for that special someone to land in my arms anytime...  Till the next time, I will walk thru my life, especially my love life, blogging it.  Cherio
