Is it normal to hold dear the steadfast opinion that because she's beautiful, she's either taken, heartless, or stupid? All of the above? Perhaps it's a shield, perhaps it's a hope, or perhaps it's simply the truth. Regardless, I still want her, but in what way? Whether it's status, validation of self, or something more carnal, it's still undeniable.  Yet this girl tops them all, the most beautiful I have seen in my 24 years. The magnitude of symptoms was overwhelming, overpowering. She had a soft sharpness to her face, an efficiency, an almost Asian quality. Her skin, dark. Her hair, filled with highlights and vibrance. She had glistening eyes, clear yet burdened. She was a veteran of life, no stranger to emotional hardship. Her lips were a rare median, not too small, not too large; beautifully curved silk.  She wore all black, symbolic it seems. She wore the darkness perfectly. Business attire, serious yet comfortable. It represented her confidence well, a candidate for success. A shiny necklace dangled from her neck, and rested in contrast on her tan chest. Larger than average breasts, they showed themselves ever so slightly at the bottom of her shirts V. A small tease for the eyes, while maintaining more modesty than most.  I watched as she sat in the back, observing the corporate game we played. Her ringless hand sat quietly on her leg, her eyes giving away her presence in a world other than this one. She and I were similar, playing the game well while having no interest in it.  I wonder who she is. I wonder where she's been. But for a short time, she filled my eyes and mind with something priceless, something I doubt I'll soon forget. She brought a little hope to an otherwise hopeless world.  I doubt I'll soon forget, Carey.
