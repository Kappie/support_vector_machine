Believe me, that really takes some doing: I am, after all, trying to convince my wife to let me build a life-size Dalek. But I digress.  If you remain unsatisfied by pretending you live on board a Federation Starship, then this is for you. 24th Century interior design have recreated the look and feel of the Enterprise (from Star Trek: The Next Generation) inside a house. Kitchen looks like a transporter room, lounge looks like the bridge, bedroom looks like crew quarters... you get the idea.  It's not a product yet, but considering the number of Trekkies there are in the world, the market must be massive. I will say, here and now, I am not considering one. It's not that I wouldn't like one, but if I'm having trouble with the Dalek, there's not a hope in hell Jackie will agree to this.  Link:  www.24thcid.com
