I'm on my second day of the art exam and its going horribly wrong. Explain more another time. Paul came over yesterday after school which was nice to see him :) He loverly. The quiz was amusing, we came second to last. Woo!! Some of the costumes were pretty cool. Adam Ant. What a giggle. And then all the nurses. Lol.   I am listening to the Bohemian Rhapsody. Love it. *big grin*.  I shall change the layout at the weekend most likely. Should be good.
