Most exciting thing that has happened is me going to see the new Sainsbury's, which I'm quite impressed with :D  My plans up to next Friday look a little like this:  Today: Bugger all Tomorrow: Work, take my little brother to cinema to see Around The World In 80 Days :) Sunday: Nowt again. Probably tidy up my room and make a start on my homework (shocking!) Monday: Nicki coming over :) Tuesday: Work in the evening, during the day too if they'll let me Wednesday: Off to Nottingham to visit family! Thursday: Still in Notthingham Friday: Come back from Nottingham  A question to everyone:  Which celebrity do you think you resemble the most?
