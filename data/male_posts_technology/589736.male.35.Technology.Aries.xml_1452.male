While this is true, he also based his character on one more influence: Pepe Le Pew, the skunk from Looney Tunes. Depp says...   "Yeah, I kind of incorporated the idea of Keith. Not like an imitation of Keith or anything but just that wisdom that he carries, that sort of confidence that he has, that attack that he has. So I got that on one side and on the other side I took a little bit of this cartoon character that I've always loved when I was a kid, his name was Pepe Le Pew. Yeah, the skunk. He smelled horrible, but was absolutely convinced that he was the ultimate ladies' man. You know the guy, he'd fall in love with this cat and the cat quite clearly despised him but Pepe Le Pew sort of read it as, 'Oh, she's just playing hard to get. Oh, she's just shy.' "  Sean Leslie,  Salt Lake City, Utah   A. Now that it's been pointed out, I can see the resemblance. And to think I said he was merely channeling a drunken drag queen. That's why actors get the big bucks.
