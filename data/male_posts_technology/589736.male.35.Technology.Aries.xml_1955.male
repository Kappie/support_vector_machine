That being said, why is he being crucified for his animated speech after the Iowa Caucuses?  Was it over the top?  Sure.  Was he out of control?  I don't think so, he was caught up in the excitement of the crowd.  Give the guy a break.  He just saw his big lead disappear in a very short period of time and was pretty disappointed.  If you (pundits) want to pick him apart, at least do it based on the issues.  Although, I did see a couple of funny clips about it from Jay Leno and John Stewart.  But they will pick at any public figure.
