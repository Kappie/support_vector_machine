It seems to be that just because you go to Oxted you appear to me automatically more intelligent than us. Your not. Maybe you know more about certain subjects than us do but we're bound to know more than you do in the ones we study.  I get the felling when your blogging away its: 'You can't have that opinion because you don't know the ins and outs so you better change your mind' and then proceed to give us all a full lesson in politics etc...  So this week so should be interesting. I missed my textiles deadline for Friday last week so I should've done all the work over the weekend but I didn't because of work and the fact my sister came home. Work on Sunday was insane. The health and saftey officier decided to pay us a visit in the afternoon so I spent all morning running around cleaning stuff, making asiles safe, helping to clear up stock room. I also had to sweep up all of the trash outside to clear the fire exit. Yuk! I spent last hour or so in the canteen clearing that up and then the entertainment room. It was crazy.  And when I got home I realised I had left my posters by my locker. Darn.
