Enjoy:  "When my grandmother got arthritis, she couldn't bend over and paint her toenails anymore. So my grandfather does it for her all the time, even when his hands got arthritis too. Thatâ€™s love." Rebecca - age 8   "When someone loves you, the way they say your name is different. You know that your name is safe in their mouth." Billy - age 4   "Love is when you go out to eat and give somebody most of your French fries without making them give you any of theirs." Chrissy - age 6   "Love is what makes you smile when you're tired." Terri - age 4   "Love is when my mommy makes coffee for my daddy and she takes a sip before giving it to him, to make sure the taste is OK." Danny - age 7   "Love is when you tell a guy you like his shirt, then he wears   it everyday" Tina - age 7   "Love is like a little old woman and a little old man who are still friends even after they know each other so well." Tommy - age 6   "During my piano recital, I was on a stage and scared. I looked at all the people watching me and saw my daddy waving and smiling. He was the only one doing that. I wasn't scared anymore. That's love" Cindy - age 8  "My mommy loves me more than anybody. You don't see anyone else kissing me to sleep at night." Clare - Age 5     "Love is when mommy gives daddy the best piece of chicken." Elaine - age 5    "Love is when your puppy licks your face even after you left him alone all day." Mary Ann - age 4   "I know my older sister loves me because she gives me all her old clothes and has to go out and buy new ones." Lauren - age 4   "I let my big sister pick on me because my Mom says she only picks on me because she loves me. So I pick on my baby sister because I love her." Bethany - age 4  ...........
