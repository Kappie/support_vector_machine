Lets bring you all up to speed quickly (There will be facts in here I would rather not have getting to the general public so if you think you may read something you don't want to know.. Hell you'll read it anyway... won't you..)  Anywho.. About 2 weeks ago I met this really REALLY nice American Girl and we hit it off pretty much straight away but nothing happened.. at first.. A while after we met it was my Birthday and she turned up and we both got pretty wasted (in a good way) and ended up having a very nice kiss when I walked her home. It was a bit wierd in some ways because before anything really happened she had said to me that she was going hom ine 3 weeks and that I should know that it couldn't ever really be anything more than kissing and I said at the time that of course I knew what I was letting myself in for (you all know me well enough to know that I have been in situations like that before.. And it has never really been a problem..)  Anywho.. (Yes, that is the third time I have started a new paragraph with the word Anywho.. I think just to piss you all off I am going to make a point of starting every paragraph for the rest of this post with a woohoo. Give me any shit and I'll stop fixing my spelling mistakes too just to really freak you out.. You'll think you are reading a post on Bubbles blog ;P) Oh yeah and in brackets again.. (hmmm, This blog is rather heavy, isn't it.. If you are finding it too heavy feel free to skip to the end and I'll tell a joke :)  Anywho.. (hehe) I have to say I ended up quite taken with her.. She is one of the nicest girls I have ever known.. Bit wierd though because I still don't really feel ready to be in a proper relationship.. I thought that recently I had sorted out a lot of my feelings and that I might be ready to be in a serious relationship again but a few factors recently have caused me to wonder if I am really as ready as I think I am.. I am still stinging a bit from my last serious relationship, I would never really say that but I do miss Emma a lot still, I know things are better this way for both of us, but it's wierd still thinking about actually being in a relationship with someone else..  Anywho, the point my last paragraph is blatantly not getting to is that I am now left with some very wierd relationship issues to sort out and no idea how to go about doing that.. Guess I'll just have to do what I always do and hope the problem sorts itself out..  Anywho, about that joke.. Last night I lay in my bed, looking at the stars, the beautiful sky and the endless horizon..... And suddenly I thought.. Where's my Fucking roof?!?! Hmmm, maybe you should have stuck with reading the blog after all.. Quick side note.. Apparently Karl is a Cunning Linguist.. And he said something about a Master Debater.. I think he was probably refering to jonny there.. Looking forward to tonight 'cause we are heading to try out our Salsa Skillz on the poor innocent bystanders in the Gaiety tonight! Wh0ot! We'll have Karl ready for improvers on Tuesday by the end of the night no probs :)  K, That is enough of that for now.. I need sleep n' stuff..  Good Luck and Good night, this has been a Gambler wibble brought to you by the letters V and D and the number 69...  If you liked it, tell your friends you liked it, and if you didn't like it, tell your friends you liked it..  HeHe  You can Go away now
