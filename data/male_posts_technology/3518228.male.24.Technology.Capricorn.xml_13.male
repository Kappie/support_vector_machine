In and of itself this is annoying, because they didn't actually document the new method.  Never underestimate the power of geeks in large numbers.  The new login method has been reverse-engineered, and most of the open IM clients are smart enough to use the new login method. (plug: I use  urlLink gaim ).  The annoying part about this, is that the new login method requires some TLS/SSL silliness.  So to get it to work in gaim, the developers used gnutls.  Now, on my Debian box, this is no problem. But on my OS X box, it's a bit annoying.  No package exists for gnutls.  gnutls requires libgcrypt, which also is not package. libgcrypt requires libtasn1 and libgpg-error.  Hey, wow.  they're not packaged either.  So lately I've been making a lot of fink .info files for these packages.  Some of the libraries, libgcrypt in particular, aren't amenable to compilation under OS X.  I think that this might have to do with the way that the compiler chain on OS X is an unholy marriage of BSD, GNU, and Apple's own tools.  On the bright side, this is good practice for me, and eventually (it'd better be soon, dammit), I'll have MSN working on my laptop again.  Stuff like this makes me want to convert my friends over to a sane messenger, like  urlLink jabber .
