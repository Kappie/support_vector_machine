For the last couple of Survivor series, I didn't really care who won. The "contest" of Survivor was not so important to me. I will tune in to: - see Thailand - see a bunch of Americans starving (i.e.: the survival aspects, hunting your own food, etc.) - see the social interactions (i.e.: an old Navy Seal becomes best friends with a gay man, Whoo-hoo!)  I will say that I don't like it when it appears "fixed" -- i.e. when the producers obviously don't want some "mean or lazy" alliance to win, so they throw in an unannonced rule change. That's just not fair sportsmanship.
