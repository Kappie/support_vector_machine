       uneasy feeling, lower abdomen 

    

     

 

 

 I left to pick up my mother from the "park and ride" after a long trip, and my intestines started to protest.  Anxiety started to get the better of me on the way there, but I was able to calm down and overcome it by the time I arrived.  Now that I'm home, there is still a mild gurgling behind my belt.
