This kind of well supported essay is about Harry's love life is disturbing in it's own right.  But who in there right mind ever even considered that Harry and Hermione could be a couple?  I mean Ron and Hermione is where its at!  They are like the Han and Leia of the Potter books!  And no I am not drunk! Ok I'll shut up now...
