I scored a whopping 591,524 (could have gotten 650,000) in Drift mode 10 laps in Drift Track # 6 with complete stage 3 Honda S2000.  Yeah, I'm a fucking NERD.  I got proof if you want me to email it to you.  Boo-yah!  Anyone want to bring it?  Anyways, time to go to the bar.  It's thursday, late work day tomorrow, I'm outtie!
