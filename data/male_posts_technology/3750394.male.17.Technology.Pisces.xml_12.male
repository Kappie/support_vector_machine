The Calgary Board of Education has recently passed a By-Law saying no one under the age of 18 may work in the I.T. Department (Stupid Politics :@).  Also, I need money, if I'm gonna get my laptop soon, I'm gonna need some mulah to make it happen, we'll see how the search goes, and i'll post later to let you know what happened.  Eric
