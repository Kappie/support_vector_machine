Actually, I was determined to make a post about something slightly interesting, but considering that part isn't even nearly finished I thought I'd say how contented I am with the jar of mixed olives I just brought back from the shop.  Sometimes it's the little things you know.     Sometimes I really don't think I could live without olives.
