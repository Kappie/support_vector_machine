Their conversation centered around people/idiots actually scanning and uploading their DRIVERS LICENSES to the internet.   urlLink Check it out ...pages and pages of photos.  Here's one  urlLink brilliant guy  who posted his drivers license, and two other ids on his blog!!  Granted he blurred the important numbers, but he left the barcode...doesn't take a genious to know that the important numbers ARE IN THE BARCODE!!   urlLink Another one ...and this one didn't blank out ANYTHING.  Next time I need to pick up a new alias, Google here I come!!  Morons!
