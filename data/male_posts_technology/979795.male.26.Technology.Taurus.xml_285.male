Freddy Sensei took us for the first half and Ah Hee Sensei the second half.  The training wasn't like very very very enriching for me, but I enjoyed it a lot. Think I really sweat things out tonight. Probably a result of training in aircon room for too long. I really can't wait for Thur's class. Wanna train again. And we're using our jo too! Whee...  Alright, just made a lunch appointment with Darren Lim, an old Uni friend, to go to Ikea, shope around and we'll prob have lunch there too. After that hopefully we can go out for a movie too. Been soooooo out of touch with shows. I think I've got a lot of back lot to watch. Argh, wish I had cable so I can download movies everyday!
