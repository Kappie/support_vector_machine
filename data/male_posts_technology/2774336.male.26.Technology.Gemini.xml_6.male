       It was good karma to write about old friends, it seems!  I've received a few emails from long lost compatriots these past few days!  I guess everyone got my email about my new journal, checked it out and decided to look me up again.  I'm grateful to all of you who decided to "drop me a line"!   I have to say it has been a very good weekend.  Since last Thursday, the symptoms of my illness have been very minimal.  After a week of bad effects, I'm able to eat not only a greater amount of food, but a good variety as well.  I think I even gained a pound or two.     Saturday evening I took a drive out to my Aunt and Uncle's home to visit with them and my two younger cousins.  The two boys and I have been spending nights at each others homes for about as long as I can remember, and definitely as long as they can.  When we were younger, our parents could always expect to be driving home in an empty car from whatever birthday or holiday at which the family gathered.  We made it a point to put on our best  urlLink wheedling  voices and beg our parents to let us stay the night.  I think our  urlLink saccharine   urlLink groveling  had less affect on their decision than our rowdy behavior every day prior; they almost never said "no".   I'm not that much older than my cousins, but when you are young a few years makes a large difference.  I'm just old enough to have had a little more life experience, but not so much older that I can't relate, and the gap is closing quickly.  Its a great way to be and I should thank our parents for having us the perfect number of years apart.   Of course, as I watch the boys grow older, I'm growing older as well. I'm noticing changes in my thinking and personality that I am sure everyone goes through.  I'm starting to  urlLink "put away childish things"  as it were, and am embracing things in a way that I used to secretly ridicule my parents for.  I'm less interested in toy trucks these days, and more interested in family, friends, and good conversation. I suppose I'm becoming an adult, and as an adult I'm learning to enjoy life in an adult way, a much more meaningful and fulfilling way. When I was a child I thought that I knew my family, but as an adult I have begun to know them again, and the experience has been one of the most enjoyable in my life.   I don't remember when I became able to speak to my Aunts and Uncles as an adult.  I can't say that I ever even imagined it as a child.  I always wanted to be one of the "big kids" but never one of the adults.  I could never understand why they would just sit around and chat when there were rooms of toys to be explored.   I guess I just didn't know what I was missing.
