I want to eat my hands and spit them in the face of the person who is in charge. I just lost my blog whilst trying to publish it. Now clearly thats annoying, but even more so when you find out that the blog that i just lost was actually a blog explaining that i just lost a blog. Fool me once, shame on me, fool me twice... well thats when the i start using the spoon on myself.  it read (sort of)   "blah blah blah hour of my life natter natter Cardboard Jungle part three   waffle waffle just went to the paper bin in the sky mumble mumble absolutely gutted etc etc"  I find it hard to stomach losing an hour of my work, i find it harder still dealing with the fact i tried to come up with an alternative blog to explain and find that too went tits up.  Goodnight people im off to bed, ill write part three (again) tomorrow.  In notepad.
