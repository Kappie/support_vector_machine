Why Dogs are shit......  a) Because they bark, b) Because they smell,  c) Because they leave bigger shits than cats, d) Because half of their breeds are no more than sloppy, drewling, yappy gobshites, e) Because sniffing your arse and licking your bollocks is fucking annoying (only acceptable if its a young woman, not a bloody dog), f) Because they suck buffallo cock, g) Because they eat children for breakfast g) Because they only carry alcahol around their necks in cold mountainous regions, and not near my home    oh and... h) Because I was once bitten by a St.Bernards!!!  Why cats are far supreme....  a) Because they are, b) Because they are cute when young, c) Because they mostly MMMEEEOOOWWW relitively quietly as opposed to most dogs annoyingly loud Barks, d) Because they are far more hard than dogs, for example lions, cheetahs etc etc, e) Because they also wish to take over the world, f) Because they don't smell, g) Because they will rip out any intruders throat with a mere stare, h) Because their evil stares (although often aimed at me by Simon Shrek's cat Spook) are bloody cool and I wish I could achieve an evil stare as good, i) Because mummies are frightened by them, j) Because they don't need to be told what to do, like dogs do, j) Because Custard's cat, Smokey, is the best creature in the world, k) Because I said so!  Please note that all cat comments above do NOT apply to Custard's other cat MOZART aka MOJO, because it is a stupid, whinney, smelly little shit!!!  Oh and Gristy, when are you going to come back out of your closet, and get over this strop you have been in for a while now??? We are all concerned for you, and here for you as friends. Love.  Acting Commander Baity signing off......
