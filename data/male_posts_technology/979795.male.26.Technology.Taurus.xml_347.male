Probably some kinda viral fever going around now. Anyway, I felt something was wrong so I popped two paracetamol and water paraded myself for a straight 4 hrs or so. By the time I went to bed, I felt a whole lot better. Sun morning came and I think I managed to get over my fever ok. But still felt weak and as though a sore throat/cough will be coming up soon. Oh well, that's normal whenever I get fever. Worst thing is that I need to formulate some teaching structure when class starts Mon onwards. In fact I'll probably be quite taxed for the next 6 weeks.  Some friends from NUS just formed a committee for GOLD - Graduates of the Last Decade. They pulled me in as a member sometime ago. Been missing  the past few meetings and just when I thought I can join the one on Sun, I fell sick. Shucks, didn't want to make it seem like I'm trying to siam the meet but I'm in no condition to join them at all this weekend.  Sat was suppossed to go for volunteer briefing at SPCA. Problem was that it was conducted at 1130hrs and I was still working at that time. Had to miss it but they said they'll schedule another one for Mar. Hope this time, it'll be in a more decent time slot.  This Tues, I think I'll approach Sensei for permission to train with Yuishinkai on Friday nights. Dunno how he'll take it. I dun wanna make it seem like I'm belittling AFS, but I just hope to expose myself to their form of exercises and training style. For one thing, I like their 'extra emphasis' on Ki compared to Aikikai style, but I also don't want to train completely in Ki style. I find that they are a lot more vocal in class (like during Alvin's classes), something I can relate to in UK under British Aikikai.
