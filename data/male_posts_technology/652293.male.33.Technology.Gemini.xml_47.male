If your company has interface designers, usability people, human factors researchers (or whatever the title du jour is), I highly recommend you contact  urlLink Dr. Bob Bailey  to take his  urlLink User Interface Update  class.  It is a 3-day course that looks at the HCI research of the past year with a critical eye.  Some of it is good, a lot of it is bad.  The class also teaches you how to interpret these studies, as well as give you some tools for your own work.  The class is given every year, and Dr. Bailey is a great speaker.
