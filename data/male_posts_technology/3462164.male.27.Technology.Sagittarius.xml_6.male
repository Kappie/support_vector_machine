Personally, I love to stand up and fight.  Submission grappling is a lot of fun and a fantastic work out, but if it were my choice I'd box it out in every match, win or lose.  Bearing this in mind, you will see more advice of mine geared toward stand-up fighting, and my first contribution is no exception.  In stand-up fighting one of the most important aspects of the game is keeping your eyes open and staying prepared.  A lot of fighters have the tendency to look away, perhaps at the ground or even the lights as their opponent pounds away with a vicious combination.  If you can muster up the courage just once to cover up and watch the punches, kicks, elbows, or knees coming at you then you can react better.  After all, you know how the saying goes, "The worst punch is the one you don't see coming."  Just remember, the same philosophy from baseball and basketball in Elementary school hold true in the brutal proving grounds, keep your eyes on the ball...only in this case the ball is represented by a fist trying to pound you into submission, which makes it all the more important!  So the next time you find yourself on the defensive, keep your eyes open and be courageous!  Remember that true courage is not the absence of fear, but how you react when you are neck deep in it.  Be brave, and see the shots as they come.  Counter when you see the opening, or get out quickly.  Try to retreat on angles instead of straight back.  If all else fails, smother your opponent's attacks by closing the distance between the two of you.  Good luck!  Train hard or fall hard.
