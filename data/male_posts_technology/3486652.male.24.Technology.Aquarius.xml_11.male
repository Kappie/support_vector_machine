Spyware is being used by spammers to sap personal information from a PC. The details are then incorporated into spam messages, typically in the subject line, the idea being that recipients will be more likely to open messages when they see something specific to them in the header.   For example, users would be reluctant to hit the delete key if they see their son's or daughter's name in the subject line of a message.  By automating the process of integrating spyware results with outgoing spam -- not a big deal, technically -- spammers could “personalize” spam to some degree and still generate high numbers of messages.
