Speaking about the management issues in oil and gas industry in the prior blog, it is clear that the related accounting issues are systemic throughout all industries, or just in Canada.  Stating their is a difference in the way the Canadians and Americans approach their business problems, this problem is likely Canadian only. The Enron's and WorldComs prove the American desire to start over is both constructive and healing. Whereas Canadians like to relive the same car crash over and over again.  Therefore based on that it might be wise to hone up on our methods of politely answering the phone. Houston will be calling.
