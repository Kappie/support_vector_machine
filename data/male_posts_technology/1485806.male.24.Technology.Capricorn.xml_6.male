People from the usual group , suddenly their brains have lubrication and their creative juices flows, what with the stories, sceneries, clothes and makeup.  Yes Makeup , u guys , should see the amount of makeup, clothes makeup from towels and balloons for breast , wow should see the pictures. Met a girl Poh Lee her name is , which is kinda cute because i got attached to her quick as in our interest are common and the fact she is a devout Christian increases my interest in her.  I went out with her to the city several times and got to know her more even in her family and her beliefs. Friends around the seminar was making fun of us of going out or courting period... I don't know but probably i should get to know her as a friend first , cause She made a good friend.  hey enough said about girls...especially when she decided to attend our cell...wai ngan,,,hold your tongue , can't have Erin sniffing around like that.  Later....who knows....still praying to God about it....can't say much...cause my heart says Go for it.  I hope that after getting her to SIB and help her contact a cell and everything else. still praying ...i mean u know, this whole 2 weeks, after going out with her, yes , really people thought we were dating but we are not.  I really am be able to go for it but somehow my conscience says to wait for it...cause the financial stability haven't be achieved.
