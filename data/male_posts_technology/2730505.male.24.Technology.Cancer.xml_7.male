Now I had to go beat this "Legend of the Street" guy driving a 350Z  It took me a few tries (6) to finally beat him on EASY!  Shit, This guy never made a mistake and when he did, he was able to fucking make up for it it was NUTS.  I would be up 6 seconds on him because he would crash and then the next thing I know he's right up on my ass!!!  I mean what the fuck is up with that?  I also believe that there is some sort of handicapper system with in the game because I was prone to lose my footing going fast if I had an absurd lead on the guy.  I guess just get to know the track and then race a clean race and use the nitrous if you get into a crash to get back up to 130 mph.  So that's done, everything is unlocked.  Whoop-dee-doo.  Now I wish there was an online option for this fucking game.    Anyways, I then set out to beat my own drift score of whatever it was and I did.  No one can beat me here.  Stage 3 S2000 10 laps around and I accumulated an insane score of 666,843.  Yeah I definitely think I can get that 700,000 mark.  That's for a different day though.  I will savor my nerdiness for a few hours till I get to see "almost" and hangout at my buddies apartment.  Next up:  Superbowl Bet, that's for Sunday night, after the game.
