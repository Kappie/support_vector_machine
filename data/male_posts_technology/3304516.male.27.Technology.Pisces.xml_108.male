Ginger was quite possibly the nicest, most gentle, friendly and easy going feline I have ever known. Ginger was diagnosed earlier in her life with an incurable liver disease but lived out many fine years as a loving and faithful cat. Ginger survived an extended separation from my girlfriend's loving care and was thankfully rejoined due to her inplanted ID tag. In her last days Ginger's health took a sudden and unexpected plunge. Ginger was not herself anymore. She was no longer eating, drinking, cleaning herself, and could barely stager a few sideway paces before laying back down again where she would lie moving her head every so ofter while she tried unsuccessfully to fall asleep. Her vision was extremely questionable, and this normaly very vocal cat was only able to muster up painful moans. After examining Ginger at the animal hospital the Vet said that her gums were very white which is a bad sign of health, she also said Ginger was very weak and in alot of pain. Ginger was given an overdose of medicine which caused her to doze off peacefully and not have to suffer anymore. I still think of Ginger daily and we all miss her company very much and wish she was still here with us.  Brought to you by HaKx
