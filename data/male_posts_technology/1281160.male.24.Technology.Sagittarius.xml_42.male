But I'm not sure, to what extent he'll utilise this blessing.   and currently I'm reading...    IBM MQ Series-1    urlLink IBM MQ Series-2      Need to compare its performace with BizTalk Server and prepare the next version (ver 0.2) of the current white paper (which is under review). I've given a timeline to my PL that the work will be done by June 20th. So, have to switch to the next gear.  and jax, the paper will not appear at infy.com ... it is an IP of infy and will be used by the Technical Architects and/or Project Managers who will go in for consultation for the clients.
