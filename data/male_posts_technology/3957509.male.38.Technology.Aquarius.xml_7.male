However, trying to get back to LA from DFW: a different experience altogether. No worries, though.  Flew into one terminal, told that my connection was in another terminal. Took the TrAAin (AA-DFW’s transportation system) to the next terminal. Flight delay! Okay, no worries, right at that gate was one of those “Aqua-Massagers”, so I thought, “Hey, why not kill some time?” 15 minutes later, relaxed and refreshed, I look at the monitor – time change for flight and also terminal/gate change, again. So, off I go to my next destination. And now, here I sit, waiting!  I am still on a high from my Toronto holiday and also visiting with friends in Cleveland. Now, am I ready to face the challenge of work next week?  Peace!
