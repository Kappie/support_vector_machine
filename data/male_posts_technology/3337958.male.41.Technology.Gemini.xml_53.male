According the this article, significant improvements have been made to the production quality in the remix.  Thanks a friggin' heap.  I think I've earned a gratis copy.  The publication also rubs more salt in my wound that I won't be able to attend the  urlLink music festival  in Austin in September.  This is the second year I've been aware of the show and unable to attend, and it's one of those things that pains one.  Maybe not as much as the Crossroads concert, but still.  Look at that lineup, will you?  I like to think that next year I will be going, but with only two weeks of vacation a year....I have to pick my spots.
