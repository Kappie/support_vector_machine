Yahoo Groups seems to be accessible again. I don't know how long it will be before it is banned again.  Rini, you had asked me about my favourite authors. The truth is I have no favorite authors. There are several things that I like in different authors. For example:   Frederick Forysth  has the knack of keeping you on the edge of your seat through his prose;  Wilbur Smith  explains the richness and beauty of Africa through his works and  Jeffrey Archer  provides the most insane twists in the tale that you kick yourself for have not seeing it earlier itself.  Ken Follet 's stories are so thrilling and captivating that you want to read them again and again.  Tom Clancy  provides so much accurate information on military hardware that you become an expert on the subject.  David Morrell  writes about the strength of human spirit.  Jonathan Black  provides an insider's view on the power struggles and behind-the-scenes of the rich and powerful people and corporations.  Michael Crichton  blends technology and fiction that you are left wondering what is not possible by man.  Colin Forbes  and  Craig Thomas  provide interesting information about the British Secret Service and its part in the world stage through their works.  Umberto Eco  stitches different subjects to provide hours of excitement and discoveries.  Different writers have different styles. So  it is really difficult to pick any one. Even one-off writers like  Bill Gates  and  Jack Welch  have imbibed thier books with thier unique styles that at the end of the book, you feel like understood them. I like books that make me feel that I have lost a great friend when I complete it. Anyone writing such a book will be my favourite.  Bye for now,
