Its president, Ken Brown has written a book stating open source using GPL is a bad idea. He makes further preposterous claims, stating Linus Torvalds stole Linux from MINIX. This junk is found on  urlLink this page   Linus Torvalds posted a  urlLink hilarious response  to this.  Andrew Tanenbaum, author of Minix, didn't really appreciate Ken Brown's report. Neither did he appreciate the way Ken Brown presented his so-called 'research'. You can read that bit  urlLink here   Ken Brown didn't quite take to Andy Tanenbaum's critique and posted his replies  urlLink here . He tried to further muddy Andy Tanenbaum, Linux, and Linus Torvalds.  Andy Tanenbaum couldn't resist writing this  urlLink rebuttal .  Will someone stop funding these ADTI jokers? They're a waste of precious time and energy [as Andy Tanenbaum's rebuttal indirectly states.]  [Update 1]:  Groklaw posted this hilarious parody  Is Brown Really the Father of Samizdat? - A Parody by Justin Moore
