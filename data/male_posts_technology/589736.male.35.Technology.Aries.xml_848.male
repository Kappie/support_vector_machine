I know a symphony will have four movements; I know sonata form is often fast-slow-fast; I know many pop songs have two verses, two choruses, and a bridge; I know James Bond will win; I know the meal will end with dessert; I know people in romantic comedies fall in love, despite the obstacles in the way.  Unpredictability is an attribute, not a virtue.
