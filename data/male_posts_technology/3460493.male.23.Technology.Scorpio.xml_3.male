Besides that, next week I'm having most of the week off from work for my graduation! That's right, yours truly finally graduated from college. Well, technically I graduated in December, when I finished my Bachelors Degree, but I don't consider myself graduated until I'm in that cap and gown! Plus, I have a chance to rub it in my professors, since I graduated with honors and most of them thought I wouldn't even finish college. Granted, that was after a very rough and shaky first year, but that's another story that'll be posted probably later on.  If anyone has actually read this blog before now, you might had noticed that my picture is now up on my profile! It's from last Christmas, but I really haven't changed a bit in the past months. I guess people feel more comfortable reading other people's stuff when they have a visual of what that person looks like. Or probably it shows that the person isn't someone who's goofing off on the web. At least that's the way it works for me.  I really love my job today. No one is bothering me, I've been able to create a couple of extra modules for my company's system without anyone asking me to do them, so there's some extra points in my favor! Hey, in this day and age of uncertainty, especially in the workplace, it helps to be indispensable.  Speaking of which, I honestly think that right now if the company fired me, they'll have a hell of a time finding a replacement. Not that I'm blowing my own horn or anything, it's that I do so many different things that I honestly think I'm seriously underpaid. I learned early in my college experience that it's better to know a something of everything than to know a lot of only one thing. That's why I chose to work with computers and programming; there's so many paths to choose from. It helps to know about different stuff. I should end this blog entry and later on write my comments on what all aspiring computer geeks should learn to help them in the real world. Have a great day, and be happy about the weekend!
