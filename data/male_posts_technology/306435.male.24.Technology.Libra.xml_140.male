The rain never came and the game was fun to watch.  The Reds lost, but I was able to see Sean Burroughs play up close.  That is right, Little League World Champion Sean Burroughs.  I watched the NFL draft the next morning and headed off to the first  urlLink Northern Kentucky Mavericks  scrimmage.  We looked good for a first get together.  I pitched the first two innings and gave up only one run.  I hadn't pitched in a while and sure do feel it today.  Saturday night I headed to the gambling boats with Justin and Tom.  My luck on the boats wasn't that great, but it was fun.  Sunday afternoon we headed to Great American Ballpark agai.  We sat in the bleachers rolled up our sleaves, took in some sun, and watched the Reds win.  I hit the fields again in the evening and took BP with Robby and Adam.  Man was I sore.  That was my weekend.  I am going to update  urlLink my page  tomorrow.  Stay tuned...
