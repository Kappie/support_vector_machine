I described to her that I was using it as a diary or journal, although it is as if I was tearing the pages from my journal and mailing them to someone who puts them up in a train station in some random city.  That is an odd metaphor, but as good as any, I guess.  This is semi-public but relatively anonymous, so I feel like I can say things here that I would not say out loud to all but a few people in the world.    Obviously a few people have stopped here to read, so I realize I may or may not have someone reading everything I say.  Occasionally I write something that I hope people will respond to, but usually it is just an outlet for my thoughts.  I'm writing for me, after all, with the purpose of exploring and illuminating the dark corners of the brain, and trying to make sense of it all.  After reading several other blogs, I get the sense that there are many other people that have a similar attitude.  Well, the boss is nosing around, so I need to look busy.  ... blah blah blah  ...  Woodford Lane ascends a moderately steep drainage course with a southwest slope aspect (Figure 2). The traveled roadway is paved and slopes approximately 15 percent to the southwest. A relatively small, but unknown quantity, of uncompacted sidecast fill is present alongside the edge of pavement.  ... yeah, that looks like typical work text.  Company picnic and overnight campout this weekend.  We have about 45 people, plus families, so we rented an entire campground about 1 hour away.  It could be interesting, stressful, disgusting, infuriating, ... or I could just stop worrying about stuff and say fuck it, I'm getting liquored up and having fun.  I'm not an embarrassing drunk, I'm usually a comatose drunk, so when the fun is over I will just collapse into the dust and drool a lot, then wake up with dirt caked onto my face.  OK bloggers, that was fun.  Hi Fiat Lux, Hi annebrev, have a smashing weekend...
