One of the reasons for this is because fiber's speed limit is MUCH higher than anything available (and affordable) out there right now.  One other reason, not mentioned in the article, that Verizon is aggressively going down this road is mostly due to the fact that they have, as I understand it, the most dark fiber out there.  "Dark fiber" is fiber that was built out, but never put into service.  Around the time of the .COM bust (1999-2000), Verizon was laying fiber like a horny college kid in a whorehouse in preparations for this type of service.  Obviously, that didn't happen then because of the bust.  But it is now!
