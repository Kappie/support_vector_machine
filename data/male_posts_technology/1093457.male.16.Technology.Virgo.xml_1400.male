Spent past 2 hours drawing a man, naked. He was naked not me. It was quite good, he was talking to us before and he did the poses we needed. He did the pose of the crucifiction of Christ. It was really good. I did some good pictures. Nakedness. Gah. Unless its Paul :p  Err what else. Oh yea I can't breath properly, My whole rib cage hurts, mainly on the left side. I'm kind of worried. It REALLY hurts to breath. And no one else is in so I can't ask mother what to do. Gah. Maybe I'll just die. Or not. Rather not.
