But this year due to some "unavoidable circumstance" ( Dilberto diplomatico ) they are not allowing family/friends... :-((  Just thinkig if I can volunteer to volunteer. After all, its not often that we are going to see dance and masti...   PS:  Dilberto diplomatico  means as diplomatic as "Dilbert" cartoons. And you won't find that phrase in any dictionary.
