I'm going to be blunt here, and may even be misconstrued as being racist. Frankly, democracy won't work because of the backwards electorate. The majority is, frankly, still rather stupid. Uneducated. Backwards. Most can barely read or write - they sign ballots with an X, after being prompted by an election official which string of meaningless characters is the current popular party's representative. They're too simple to discern outright lies and campaign propoganda from real policies. They're manipulated by violence or the threat of violence in the case of Zimbabwe, or simple fear in the case of South Africa and Namibia. Fear that voting for anyone other than the party that threw off the shackles of their previous oppressors would result in a return to that state of affairs. It takes acts of monumental inhumanity before such rather basic people would take a risk. Something like a civil war.  An example. What would have happened, had democracy been suddenly introduced to feudal England? It took the English hundreds of years to gradually adapt to the idea of majority rule. It took ages to abandon monarchy as a form of government and choose democracy. It wasn't an overnight thing. The same is happening in Africa, particularly Southern Africa. Colonial Europe took a very basic people, exploited them, felt guilty afterwards, and then chose the path of attempting to prepare them for a form of independant governance completely alien to a people only used to nepotism. It is only natural for such a people to backslide back to nepotism and dictatorship when the reigns are handed over. In some situations it's obvious (Mugabe), in others, not so obvious (Mbeki appointing buddies and sycophants to cabinet).  Africa hasn't had the time that the rest of the free world was granted to adapt to democracy. It's been shoved on Africa, and Africa has accepted it because A)the rest of the civilised world had outlawed everything else, and b) people, no matter whether they're ready for it or not, will jump at the chance for real liberty.  Russia and Africa, for example, share much of the characteristics of a sudden change to democracy. Violence. Crime. Corruption. Power plays. Division. Secession. The list goes on.  It all happened too fast. Yes, Colonialism no longer has a place in the world, neither does Apartheid, or Communism. But going from Apartheid rule to true Democracy in the space of barely a decade, is just too much to deal with. Hell, no-one could. Eastern Europe apparently can't. They're still killing each other in the Balkans. And this hasty Iraq pullout that even Bush is aiming for, now, won't either. It's a mistake. The war wasn't, but not going the whole nine yards is.  What's the solution? I doubt there is such a thing as a quick fix. In fact, I believe the belief in quick fixes is the whole problem. Countries with stable democracies today had to go through long and bitter civil wars. The liberal peacenik handling of South Africa's switchover has/had many the worldover applauding, but South Africans themselves know that all is  not  in fact, very well. For a short while, while Mandela was running things, it looked like SA would get it right, where almost everyone else had failed. Why? Because it had it's benovelent, absolute ruler. A monarch. A kind King to guide the nation. Now? Now it has a normal man.  A President. With all his foibles, faults and inconsistincies. Not a saint forged in the hells of a life in prison. Just an average schmo. A true Democracy can nonetheless function with such a leader (as evidence : the USA, and Bush). I doubt a fledgling African nation can.
