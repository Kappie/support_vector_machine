I told her that "since I worked an extra hour on last Friday... I am going to use it today to come in an hour late", which worked pretty well.  Front Page was fun. It is nice to know a girl who is friends with other girls. This girl A was there with her friend J and 3 of her other friends came later, so it was cool. Her friend J was really cool and she was pretty cute too! I talked with her a bit and she seemed very interesting. When I say"talk" I actually mean yell, because we were in a very loud part of the bar. I think the speaker in the corner must have been pointed directly at us. I said that she and A should just stay at my place (although there isn't really that much room, but I guess that is the point.. "here sleep in my bed!"), because they had a long commute home (something like an hour, hour and a half). She replied "maybe if it were the weekend, but I have to work tomorrow". I was sure I didn't hear THAT right, but I did ;-P I told her that it was a shame because we could always use good looking girls hanging around our place, which is true. If I could pay female models to come and hang out at the apartment I think it would make me cooler by association, and if I wanted to see a hot girl I would just have to turn my head slightly (hm, good deal). I also talked to A's other friend M (one of the other 3), who also seemed pretty interesting. I talked to her for a while before she left (maybe I drove her away!). We smoked a cigarette and chatted it up. She kept looking out the window though. Said she was a people watcher.  On a side note. I found my cigarettes after not finding them all week! In the other post I wrote I talked about how my memory is bad. It is, because you could see them while standing in front of my dresser. It was on top of my 7ft bookshelf and under my stack of towels, but sticking out the side so I could see them. I was thinking to myself that I would be drinking that night and would be fiending for a cig. Then  *poof*  I look up to the right spot right after searching through this pile of bandanas that I have looked through 10 times before and see them like a shining grail shaped beacon! :-) But... I should probably quit soon since it is a bad habit. I will just have to jerk off some more. You know, to make up for the bad habit by increasing another habit. (that works right?)  So, a good time was had by all. I kind of appreciate the irony of my blog title now tho. I don't really have any sex, because I am single and not that great at just meeting women and having sex with them (note to self: acquire this skill). Also I don't really lie, I have the word truth tattoed on my back for God's sake, albeit in Japanese kanji. But the disk space thing, that isn't ironic in any way... unless  urlLink Alanis Morrisette  can make some connection.  urlLink Videotape  was already taken, and I work in help desk so it fits. Although, I do have porn on my computer at home... so maybe I have sex and disk space, no lies tho... I'm an angel.
