More than a million households deleted all the digital music files they had saved on their PCs in August, a sign that the record industry's anti-piracy tactics are hitting home, research company NPD Group said.  C'mon!! ... gimme a break! I don't know who would believe this crap being dished out under the guise of a survey/study. Can't they tell that people have just stopped sharing their music online??!! Anyone with a shred of common sense ought to know that!! But then, I'm sure this is just a study sponsored by RIAA or its underlings!
