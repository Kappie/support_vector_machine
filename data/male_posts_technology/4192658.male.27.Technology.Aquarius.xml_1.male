"Dude, I am not worried about celebrating tonight, I don't feel like, but I am worried about what I am I going to tell everyone tomorrow, how did I spend new year's eve"   Take a step back and ask yourself this question. Why should I party ?   I don't want to celebrate new year. It remindes me that I am stuck in life for one more year. Things that should have happened in my life are still pending and I do not see a clear path ahead to resolve those issues. Yes, I am talking about your job, you wanted to change your job and remember last year you promised to yourself that you will stop taking crap from your boss and move on with a new job. If this organization cannot value you as a contributor then you would rather move on with a better organization yourself. I am also talking about leaving the fixation of Mr Handsome into the Recycle Bin and "move-on" with my own life.... Oh yeah, what about plans of "further studies" ? and plenty of more committments which are still unfullfilled ...  I don't see what should I celebrate new year's eve for .. but still when Harsh would call me tomorrow and ask " Hey , how was last night" ... (As if I was supposed to get laid last night).... I would want to reply " Oh, last night was fantabulous, I had so much fun ... it was an outstanding party last night.... we danced till 4:00 AM and Blah blah .. and more Blah Blah" ...  This is what is the social pressure to party... Why the heck ?   Some of my friends would be spending time by drinking and listening to songs at the newly purchased music system (which  they incidently do every weekend of the year on one or the other flats) and each one of them would be thinking that if I would have had a girlfriend, I would have spend few K and I would have been dancing in the hottest pub of the town and would not have been sitting with these jerks :-) ha ha ha ha ..... and merely this thought would spoil the whole evening for them.   Some of my assumingly lucky friends have managed to get hold of a partner (who obviously didn't have better option because their b/fs or g/fs are not in town) and have planned to go out for a dance party at some extremely expensive place who would charge them a fortune to try hard and enjoy while they keep on thinking that one day they will have a partner with whom they will "really" enjoy   There will however be people who would have a different cause to celebrate. People who are fortunate to find a life partner who shares the same feelings. This enviable lot would enjoy the evenings inspite of the fact that it is a new year's eve or not. They actually enjoy all the evenings , yes, wipe that smirk from your face and believe it. Don't worry, your day will come too :-)  Till now, I have not been able to figure out who would really be able to use the event of New Year's Eve... I guess the wanna be partners who are still not sure , they stand a chance to utilize this opportunity and get an insight into partners (if they are lucky to go out w/o their elderly couples)   These wannabees would try and lure the other person throughout the sequence of events and constantly evaluating the other person.... which can be a potential killer of the evening fun.  Understand !!! the important part of having fun is being lost by the very act of trying too hard to achieve it. Relax and free your mind from the pressure to party which media and show biz opportunists has created to rip you of your money and good time and set your expectations right for the evening tonight.   As for me, I have no plans for the evening because most of my friends are busy trying to find out where all are parties being organized and which of them have coolest crowd to bump into.... I would probably join my family to a small gathering at one of our family friend's place and share the warmth of being together. However, I have a plan to throw a birthday party on Jan 2nd for all my friends, feel free to get yourselves invited incase you  want some fun ;->
