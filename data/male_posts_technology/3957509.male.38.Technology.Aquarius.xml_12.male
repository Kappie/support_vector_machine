Every time I see a casket lowered into a grave I feel so empty.  I was asked to share a poem at the funeral, and this is the one I read (someone gave this to me years ago, and I really love the last two lines):  "When I am Gone"  When I am gone release me, let me go; I have many things to see and do.  You mustn't tie yourself to me with tears; Be happy we had so many wonderful years  I gave you my love you can only guess How much you gave me in happiness. I thank you for the love you each have shown, But now it's time I travel alone. So grieve awhile for me, if you must;  It's only for awhile we must part, So bless the memories within your heart  I won't be far away, for life goes on.  So if you need me, call and I will come.  Though you can't see or touch me, I'll be near; And if you listen within your heart you'll hear  All my love around you soft and clear. And then when you come this way alone  I'll greet you with a smile and say, "Welcome Home." --Author Unknown  I know that we'll see each other again, my dear Drew. So until that time, QaPla!  Hug your loved ones today!  Peace!
