Arriving at a solution that is simple is a non trivial task. The simplest solutions are the most elegant. Simplicity requires breaking up each difficulty into as many parts as feasible and necessary to resolve it. The solutions to the most difficult of the problems lie in simplicity. Never should one be afraid to roll back to a simpler solution if and when one becomes available.
