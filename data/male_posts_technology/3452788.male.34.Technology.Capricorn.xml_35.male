In reality, they probably check the Classmates site about as often as I do, meaning it may be weeks before they get the message.  Fine, it's been 15 years, what's another week or 2?  My world will not end one way or another.  However, I would like to hear from Angie's sister, if that was really her. (see earlier post.)
