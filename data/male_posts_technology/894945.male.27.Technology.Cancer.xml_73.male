I didn't have any of the paperwork or the packaging, but they are sending me out a replacement free of charge. I guess even multi-millon-dollar-super-corporations still have time for the man in the street during global domination.  Oh yeah. I got all my hair shaved off too.  Before:    After:    My buddy Danny sent me  urlLink this cool flash game  - perfect for anyone that's ever owned a Scalextric set!
