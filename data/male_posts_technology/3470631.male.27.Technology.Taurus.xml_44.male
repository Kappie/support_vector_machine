The Sox have been in first place (or tied for first) in the AL East the last 6 Memorial Days. They haven't won the AL east in any one of those years. Thanks Theo!  I hate fat people - but I love fat chicks.   I hate people who bring their own meals on airplanes.   When is a creative guy like myself gonna get a break. I'm going nowhere fast!!  I'm an organizer of people - a man of the grassroots. I might get a PhD in grassroots movements.   Late sox game tonight - which basically means I ain't watching. I'm sizing up the Sopranos from this weekend, and a frozen gourmet pizza. WOOOHOO!   Ch CH CH CHANNNNGGGGEEEEEEES
