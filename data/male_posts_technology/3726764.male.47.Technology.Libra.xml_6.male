A couple of days were cloudy, rainy and/or cool. Had my first day of Summer school Tuesday. By the end of the first hour, I decided to drop the class and test out of it. The class moves way to slow, is way too easy, and the teacher is a major bore. By the next day, I had wished I hadn't dropped it. I needed it for something to do. I'm also concerned testing out may not be that easy. Last night, I checked into the availability of the class this Fall. The only possible opening I can use (with a different instructor) is at 7 in the morning and overlaps my Network Admin class by about 20 minutes. I think I'll be able to convince the instructors to let me take it and cut out of one class early and/or get to the other class a little late. Now I need to find something else productive to to until Fall classes start. Maybe I'll get out some of my old text books and do some reading. Also have some tweaking to do on my desktop pc. I just don't want to get lazy and vegetate. I see my profile here has been viewed a few times by others. It'd be nice if someone had something to say about any of my blogs. Even if just to tell me they read them. Oh well. I guess I was just hoping for a little more interaction with others through my blog. Not that big of a deal. Time to get busy doing something now.
