After a few moments going back and forthabout our opinions on the matter, we begged the question:  Why isn't there a man-pill?   After 2 great minds munged the problem, we came up with this:  If there was a man-pill, then human beings would go extinct.   Why do we think that?  Dood, if there was a man-pill, EVERY GUY WOULD BE ON IT!   Currently, I'm drafting a business proposal, and Craig has enrolled in Chemistry and Biology classes at the university.   Please send me an email if you'd like to pre-order the...... MAN-PILL  "Because Condoms are for Sailors!"
