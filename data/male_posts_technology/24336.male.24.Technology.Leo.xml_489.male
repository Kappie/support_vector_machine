Check out the rest of the galleries  urlLink here .  Hopefully that will quickly fill up with galleries from my tenth and final semester here.  Last week was spring break and mostly it was spent at work.  For those of you that haven't been dragged into the Daily by now, here is a  urlLink quick run down of the important areas .  The  urlLink really big   urlLink black server  in that gallery is the old database server that I replaced last weekend.  Other than work, I hung out with Leah as much as possible.  We went up to State for a night and that would have been a prime candidate for picture taking, but I hadn't met 90% of those people yet.  It's just better to not be "that guy that always has his camera" just yet.
