PUH-leeze... where do these people come from? i've been a cult follower of ikea for years and have travelled the continent to simply touch as many stores as i could. but i admit i squeeled when i stepped in the store, i felt like mecca had come to me, one less pillar to fulfill =)  but the tourists, traffic, suburbanites, and moa crap was too much to handle. my friends and i practically ran back to our car to get out of suburbia as fast as fuckin' possible before it started turning us into androids... ahhh, thank GOD for urban centers.
