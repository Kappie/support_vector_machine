Don't kick me out I am back.  How My Life Is Enriched By You All: I have never been dumped on the internet before by someone I don't even know. THANKS A LOT HARD.  I would have to meet up with the one other absent posted.  I knew I should have gone for jonnie.  I have learned how incredibly bad my spelling is, and often welcome the comments about it.  And I also think it is cool I can get drunk in the hot tub and make an ass of myself and you all treat me like that is normal.    The only way i could be more happy here is if you threw in a few midgets and some elephants. I love you guys... hey, thanks to who ever is feeding free beer.  That damn dog would be dead with out you.
