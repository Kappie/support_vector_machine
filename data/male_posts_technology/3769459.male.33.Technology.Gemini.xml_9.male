Also I have officially left Scratch. It was a hard decision, as I started the band almost 10 years ago and hated how things were going. The main reason I had quit is because, several of the members did not want to play many shows. I felt that since we had spent alot of $$$ recording a 3 song demo, we best work it out with shows around Ottawa and the surrounding areas.  Anyways...Onward and upward from here...Ciao
