I guess I can attribute my lack of interest in blogging to my personality. In general, I am a pretty introverted dude. Well, that's not entirely true according to the Myers-Briggs test which you all can take  urlLink here .  I last took this test in high school and on the 'Introvert/Extrovert' chart, I barely scored into 'Extrovert.' It would be interesting to see what I would get on that shit at this point in my life but I digress!  My point is, I never really saw the point of keeping an online diary (which is what a blog is basically) for all eyes to read. In my opinion, it would be much more interesting for the readers' sake to fictionalize things.   But who knows...maybe this little experiment could prove to be fun and productive (?). Maybe I will catch onto the whole blog craze. Maybe I will find it to be a cathartic experience to post my inner thoughts, dreams, and desires online for random people to obsessively pore over. Maybe...  Um. Nah. Fuck it. Let's have a little fun. Sit back, relax, take a long drag off your  urlLink L  and enjoy my random-ass ramblings.
