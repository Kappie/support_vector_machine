I find it interesting that she was never sick at my house but day 2 arriving in Michigan and she is sick.  I did talk to Karissa momentarily.  Enough to get a kiss and hug and that was about it.  She asked me to call her back later and I obliged however, she did not want to talk later so I was shot down.  Well the ride home this morning was a little on the sore side but other then that it was a good ride.  This cowboy is just not used to being in the saddle so we will be building up to that ride.  Today I drove the car.  Other then that not much going on.  I am wondering about what   SFW   next move and that enters my mind all the time now but good things come to those who wait so we will see.
