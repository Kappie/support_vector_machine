Last nights dream started like a normal twenty something mom of a toddler dream.   I was riding in the backseat of my Grandparents car with Zack, who for some reason was around two months old. The only minorly strange thing here was that Zack was extremely young and I have seen these particular Grandparents in forever, yet this is normal dream strangeness. So we’re driving down a rode in some unknown ghetto little town and I notice that Zack isn’t buckled into his car seat. This kind of freaked me out because I’m am a slightly paranoid and overprotective mom. So I yell at them to pull over and they yell back ‘Just buckle him up.’ So I try and realize that the metal parts to the straps are broke off. This angers me so I’m slightly dream pissy and yell at them to go to Walmart so I can buy another one. After a long argument that ghetto rural towns don’t have a Walmart they concede because I am all-knowing and I know where one is. (Hey, it my dream!)   As we are driving down this dirt road the town disappears and there is a huge ditch on the side of it. My Grandpa is driving and he just kind of pops into the back seat to help with the car seat, maybe jiggy-rig it to work for a couple of miles. Just as it dawns on me that no one is driving I look out the window and yell ‘DITCH!’ Then we fall, forever, and land on a tree branch about 1/3 of the way down the ditch with long yellow grass weeds getting caught in my hair. I think for a second about huge bugs and fleas just leaping on my head and going to town before I pull Zack out and of the ghetto car seat and leave the car. Just then my Grandma tells me ‘Don’t pull on the grass.’ I tell her its sturdy enough. Just as I do the grass breaks and Zack and I fall and land on another tree branch near bottom of the ditch. Somehow we are just fine and Zack is still asleep. So I sit on the branch. The height is just high enough that you know you will break a leg if you jump down yet you still debate if you really should. I hate that height it’s such a mind boggler. Yet I sit and wait, I don’t know for what.   Just then a town appears in the distance with a police station on the outskirts. Fantastic! I get up and jump up and down yelling for help. A young male cop comes over and so I ramble on about all that happened and all he says is ‘Alright.’ I get kind of mad when at the end of my speech he’s still standing there saying ‘Alright.’ So I ask him if he has a ladder or some rope, he just looks at me, says ‘Alright’ again and walks off. Now I really consider jumping, but before I do my dream turns into EQ, complete with windows and chat channels and my Grandparents OOC the zone with ‘Don’t Aggro the Cops in this Zone unless you have Vah Shir Stat FOOD!’ Now I’m panicked. I’m stuck in a tree with a baby without any stat food at all and no temp or any HP buff at all to cushion my fall. I’m even OOM for some reason or another. I sit and try to med really, really fast cursing all the enchanters that are in the zone and to scared to come give me clarity.  Then the cop comes back with the mayor. I look up and my Grandparents have already ported out, damn wizards. The mayor looks nice, he’s smiling and laughing, though it is an election year so that explains that. And good God they con red. Me, a cleric, and a kid facing reds. I decide the best plan of attack is to just go with the flow till mana charges for a gate. They get me down and take me to their police station. It’s full of con yellows to reds and election year posters. They ask me to join their guild to put the mayor on the throne again and take up their quests. I deny I just can’t join the side of evil. They go agro.  Just at this moment Zack wakes up and then I wake up. I kick Pheonix. I tell him something jumbled about how I need to make some stat food so I wont die and he tells me to go back to sleep. Yet, somehow I cant because all I can think about is how to make Vah Shir stat food.
