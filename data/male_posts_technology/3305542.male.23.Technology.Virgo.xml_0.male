The rest of the time has been spent relaxing on the beach and drinking margaritas and daquaries (sp?).  A person couldn't ask for more beautiful weather so far.  We have gone to the clubs each night.  They are pretty crazy.  I will post more details and some pictures once I get back as I am paying $3 for 15 minutes of Internet access and it is running out.  Later, Jeff
