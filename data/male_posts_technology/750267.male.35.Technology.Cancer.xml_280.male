I have a fairly good credit history - no bankruptcies or missed payments on my credit report. Yet my FICO credit score is less than perfect. I really want to find ways to improve that score, so I don't have trouble getting a loan when I really need it. What's the problem, and what I can do to fix it?  I aim to explore those questions. Along the way, I'll point out sites that contain useful information. I will post useful information of my own. And I will track my own personal progress here.  I hope you can respect the fact that I am hesistant to devulge too much personal information here. I don't want people to know my personal income, or my net worth, et cetera. But I do want to document my journey, and this site is the place I will do it.  Cheers!
