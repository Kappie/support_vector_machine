The problem I had with Iowa was they took the DJ and his samples out of the equation, and it was a big pity cos he was what made the first album so different and refreshing from the standard metal fare, at least for me. Well they gone back to that type of experimentation in the latest release. They have included acoustic ballads, strings, goth syths, military-styled drumming, classic metal guitar solos and songs that alternate between really heavy screaming/growling and singing. Yep Corey has injected a lot more singing into almost all of the songs compared to the previous 2 albums, and he has a decent enough voice so it works most of the time. The only problem I have with this album is that the heavier songs on the album do not really compare to their best songs from their self-titled or even Iowa. There is nothing as intense as EYELESS or Surfacing or even the Heretic Song (the one that comes closest would be The Blister Exists). Overall I would give it 4/5.   Best Tracks : Duality, Before I Forget, Vermillion
