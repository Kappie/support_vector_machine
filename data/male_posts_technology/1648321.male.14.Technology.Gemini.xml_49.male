Last week went pretty well, and today was a good day, along with the weekend was exceptional. I went to a motorcorss on Saturday night with Zach. It was really cool because we were in the sixth row and right next to a big jump, so all the motorbikes went above where we were. Zach goes to a year-round school in NY, so he got last week off and he went back to NY yesterday (at least I'm pretty sure of that). I got to go out to breakfast at the Highland Grill on Saturday morning. Oh and I forgot to mention I went shopping on Friday night (it was pretty boring). I got cool new Nike running shoes and nice Wilson tennis shoes since I had tennis from 1:30-3:00 PM on Saturday. I took my PowerBook around town in the car and found 40+ wireless networks just from only two routes! Now I am really bugging my parents (mostly my dad) to get wireless internet! I can't believe I still use ethernet cables! :-P I don't know if I already said this but I have 1141 songs right now in my iTunes library! :-) This week is in fact an A, B, A, B, A week but we have a non-uniform day every day with a theme. Today was pajama day (since it's Monday it's always hard to get out of bed). I hope this is a long-enough post to make-up the days I didn't post! Thanks a lot and have a good week too! :-D
