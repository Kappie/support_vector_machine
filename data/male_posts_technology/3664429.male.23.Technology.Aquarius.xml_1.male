I gave him water through a straw, and he ended up rejecting the water.  (It came back up..)  After that, I gave him some milk made for kittens.  He kept that down, but I had to feed him using a kitten bottle.    I am worried sick about going to the vet, because last time I went in March, they put my best friend in the world to sleep.  I thought I was doing the right thing by choosing Buddy.  He looked so cute, even though he slept, I thought he needed a home.  --------  Oh, I found this awesome job that hopefully I get a call for.  The name of the company is Alltel, and they are hiring for a Local Area Network/Desktop Support Specialist I.  The pay rate is very cool, and I meet all the requirements and more.  This is a job I would enjoy.  Hopefully, since I am up right now (1:40am,) I hope I am one of the first to apply.    I'd enjoy working for a company again, without going through a 3rd party.  It's so much nicer when that happens.  I was treated nicer than the temporary consultants at AVnet.  Even though, I was probably easier to let go than those consultants too.  Speaking of that, I did some thinking and it made me just more upset.  "He unpacked the boxes slowly."  Well, duh, I never said I worked in a warehouse.  People need to get a life, and let me do my job when I am called to do it.  Let my boss worry about my performance, and those other managers can worry about themselves and their employees.  They don't know me, they don't know I am some geeky network person who has never mass-produced PCs in a production environment.  Putting together 8 PCs a day perfectly, with no mistakes, is pretty impossible to do in one week.  I'm sorry, but they never gave me a chance.  I was willing to work with the pain, I did my job, and they told me they didn't think it was working out.  I was in utter shock.    Oh, and the first job I had here with Sonicwall.  They fire me because I followed THEIR procedures.  They said they will not do an RMA until steps have been followed.  The customer REFUSED to do those steps and demanded an RMA right off the bat.  That was a really lame company to work for.  I normally do not put down companies, but that one was pathetic.  The person higher than me that I depended on for help told me to tell him "we'll send you an RMA, but we don't want to hear back about this problem because it's not the box."  (it was his configuration.)  So, anyhow, I told him that and he went off and emailed the president of the company.  I wanted to so badly write the president a letter telling him that the customer twisted the details so badly, he made a huge mistake by listening to him.  But I don't care, like I said, that company isn't worth the trouble. The consulting company was a pain in the a$$ too.  They were cheesy and only paid my $10.50/hr and that was WAAY below what I made in St. Louis.  They told me it was due to my telephone experience.  Okay, they need to move aside.  ARGGGGHHHH.   Oh, and some people out there don't understand how frustrated I am.  I am trying to pay my bills, get employed, and hopefully move somewhere nice.  (Not that where I live isn't nice, it's just that I want to get my own place.)  ----------  Saturday we are talking about driving up to payson (in the mountains) and then taking an airplane trip to Sedona.  It sounds very neat.  Today, I am probably going to go see The Terminal.. it looks so funny!
