Srinath quoted once "Let him take his first five wicket haul, and u'll see him take many more soon after that"... Zaheer took his first five wicket haul against New Zealand in 2002... and ended up as 3 successive hauls in that series... I had not spent night-outs at office in all of my 18-month career.. Then it happened at last on May 6th... 5 days later, today.. am here again sitting at office late at night... and probably many more to come...!!
