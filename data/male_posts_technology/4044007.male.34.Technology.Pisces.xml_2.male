"All diplomatic efforts should beexhausted before considering more drastic measures to stop Iran's nuclear programme." said Army chief of staff General Moshe Yaalon. "Political pressure certainly has potential, just as it worked on Libya. And this must be exhausted first of all, in my view."   Is there any way for Bush to classify them as terrorists? Afterall some al-Qaeda members have been allowed to pass through. According to resent inspections there is some evidence of a nuclear weapons program that could be used against Iran.  Iran has denied that they have any nuclear weapons programs and that their program is strictly for energy research only. They said they signed the NPT and would allow UN inspectors in as they have signed for that as well. Afterall Israel has not signed the NPT so I don't know what they're complaining about.  Now here's the way I see it. Israel and the US will push for more UN inspections. I don't think Bush could do the same thing he did in Iraq which was accusations without anything backing it up, even if he did declare it a terrorist regime. Iran is not on the 'Coalition of the Willing' list which puts them in a unfavorable light in Bush's eyes. Afterall if they're not with us, they're against us, or something to that affect. The trick will be to keep the hard liners in check. Should they take control it may cause Iranians to flock to their country in a patriotic surge, similar to what happened in the US after 9/11, and back any actions they may deem appropriate, again such as 9/11.   Here's some additional information on the evidence that has been gathered:   urlLink http://www.cfr.org/background/iran_curtail.php
