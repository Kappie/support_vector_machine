From Monday you can buy a £300 phone from 3 for just £149.99 so long as your register itin our store! (I don't know how that works, we haven't been sent that infomation yet. LOL.) How was I chosen for this? Simply because I am the only person who can fit into the t-shirt. Woo!  No one better come into Woolies next weekend. If you do I will die of embarassment because we have to wear these crazy Finding Nemo T-Shirts. Ahhhh. they have segulls all over the front!!!!!!
