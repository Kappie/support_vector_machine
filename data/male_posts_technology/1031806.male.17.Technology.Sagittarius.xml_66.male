Going to and from school on Tues. was annoying cause a had a couple huge bags with me, besides my school stuff.  SWHB youth group on Tuesday was pretty fun - nothing that much out-of-the-ordinary happened, it was just fun.  Last night's CCWC youth group was better, though.  Afterward, Brady, Cori, Steven, and I walked over to Carl's Jr., in the rain, and got milkshakes of all things.  :)  I'm looking forward to the growth group I have tomorrow night (at the bowling alley), seeing  Nemesis  on Sunday, my birthday on Wednesday, and possibly going to see the Nutcracker Ballet on Thursday.
