A fierce debate is raging at this very moment over the proper boundary between our rights as consumers and the rights of copyright holders. So why is the record industry still clinging to the old business model for dear life?  Like many people, I have an extensive DVD and CD collection. I would guess that over the past two or three years, I have spent more than $1,000 on DVDs alone. I'm one of those people who see a movie in theaters, and if I enjoy it, I'll purchase the DVD when it becomes available � movie studios must love people like me.  There are several reasons that make owning the DVD attractive for me: * The ability to watch the movie any time I wish, as many times as I wish * The extras included in the DVD (documentaries, commentaries, out-takes, etc.) * The quality of the experience when played on my home television and stereo system  Movie studios have nothing to fear from me. My wife and I spend $50 on the movies that we enjoy when all is said and done (which if you think about it is still way too much), and the availability of movies for download off the Internet does nothing to diminish that for us. I've sampled some of the movies available online, and if the file sizes and download times doesn't get you, the poor quality of the video and sound surely will.  Unfortunately, what is true for the movie industry is not true for the music business. Despite how impractical it is to download a movie, it is extremely practical to download music. It's fast�a song can generally be acquired in only a few minutes. It's free�illegal but free. And the quality of the end product is better than what the music companies provide.  What? How can I say the quality is better? Well, think about it like this... If I download a dozen of my favorite tunes and burn it to a single CD that I can play in my car, is that not better than having to purchase a dozen CDs, and having to be my own record DJ while I'm driving, swapping CDs after every song?  But wait, you say. You can always purchase the dozen CDs, then burn your own compilation CD of those. That's legal, right? Well, no actually. You can't even do that. So you see, the current illegal method is actually a significant improvement over the way music companies currently allow us to be able to use their music.  So how can the record industry save itself, then, when their annual sales appear to be in a free-fall in recent years? What must they do to make money, and at the same time keep control over the distribution of their music?  Well, the answer surely must involve lowering the retail cost of music. $8.99 for a CD is more than reasonable, even considering the cost to develop the artists and produce the material. $18.99 for a CD is a rip-off, pure and simple. From what I hear, the actual artists actually get the short end of the stick anyway when it comes to the production of music.  More convenient methods for digital music delivery must also be there�it is certainly true that there is no incentive to buy a CD when there is only one or two good tracks. Most CDs are used for a month or two and then sit in the CD rack never to be used again anyway.   And the freedom to do whatever we wish with the music�burn our own compilation CDs, download to MP3 player, etc.�also must exist for this model to work. The music companies are currently experimenting with their own music download services that are still quite expensive and severely restrict what you can do with the music. That won't work.  It's up to the record companies to figure out how they can make a profitable business out of this. But digital music is here to stay�no lawsuit will stop it at this point. The only question is do we have to keep stealing it, or will you make it easier for us to acquire legally?   2003 -- Scott J.
