So much was the hype created abt the Indo-Pak series that actual cricket was almost forgotten.......but what a belter of an opening match it was yesterday........close to 700 runs in a single day's cricket is absolutley astounding...........hats off to all the batters and condolences to the bowlers...:-)......India might have won the match by a whisker, but they have more than a worry to counter.....if it was not for the huge amount of extras gifted by the Paki bowlers(may be a welcome gift to the indians..!!), Pakistan theoretically won the match...hence they would have gained some mental points.....the belief would be that any total put up by the formidable Indian batting lineup is not un-achievable.....courtesy an average indian bowling attack and river-bed pitches.....350...400...450.....no problmes......should we recall javagal srinath...........???
