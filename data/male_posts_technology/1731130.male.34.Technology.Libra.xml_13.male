Why not instead hide it somewhere so only those who are really keen will have the opportunity to experience you muse. Even better put it somewhere where it will only be seen  by accident !  OK, it's a bit of a stretch, but let me set this one up for you. You're on the net, you type in a web address and you type .cone instead of .com What do you get? A 404 - Page not Found error. Informative and to the point: yes, infuriating and annoying: sometimes, inspiring and artistic: ummm, no, not really.  Well there are people in this world who put a lot of effort into making these 404 pages more than a three digit number and a paragraph of techno-crap. Have a look at some of these beauties.
