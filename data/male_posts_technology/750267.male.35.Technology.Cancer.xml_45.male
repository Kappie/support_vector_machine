It would give me an excuse to go out and buy one -- I've never used one before, and have always been curious about what those Mac-huggers have been ranting about. I'm almost (almost, I said) jealous about these people who are soooo fanatical about this company. I wish I had a company or a brand I could love. Why is a brand of computer so special? Us PC-huggers don't understand that. I have no loyalty to any brands -- sell me a no-name PC as long as its cheap. I did like my Dell laptop very much, and have a positive attitude toward Dell, although it won't be a deciding factor   In fact, I drink Diet Pepsi or Diet Coke interchangably. I go to Wendy's, Burger King, or McDonalds. No brand loyalty that I can think of. My last three cars have been all different manufacturers.
