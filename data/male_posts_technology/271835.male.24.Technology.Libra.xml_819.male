Here's the all new Return Of The Jedi ending for the DVD release - with  urlLink Anakin inserted into the final screen  to tie up the loose ends created by plot inconsistencies caused by the release of the early Star Wars episodes.  I was under the impression the whole story was written before the filming of eps 4-6 were filmed - so if that's the case why weren't plot inconsistencies ironed out at that stage? Or is it just that George Lucas is an indecisve prick?
