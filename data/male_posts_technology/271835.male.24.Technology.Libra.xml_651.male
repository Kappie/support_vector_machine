Basically it's a coalition of laydees who have designed some anti-Bush underwear and are flogging it. Oh and a gallery of people who've bought them and  urlLink submitted pictures of themselves  erm... 'protesting'.  Bungers will be taking names for an Axis of Eve themed protest march through Newcastle like this one in  urlLink Washington DC .
