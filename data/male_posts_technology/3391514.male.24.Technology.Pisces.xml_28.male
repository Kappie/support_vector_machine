The GM's interesting idea was to set the game solely within a city.  Those of you not familiar with Rifts will know it lends itself to travelling.  However, this isn't necessarily a problem.  The group consists of a mechanic, spy, mercenary and mage... the spy rarely involves himself with the group and the mercenary is far too busy chasing skirt to help anyone... so the mechanic tries a little affirative action, with the mage in support.  And they promptly get hit  VERY HARD  with GM Power.  The pair travelled to a nearby cave to hunt for the big bad guy, and found him.  Of course, said bad guy immediately used his ultra-spell, and virtually annihilated the two.  And then proceeded to kill the mage  after  the player went home.  Not a good state of affairs.  A word of warning... don't roleplay if the GM appears to have had a bad day.  I also visited the Doctors for a Health Check.  Yes, I'm overweight, I knew this already.  The pleasant surprise was the fact my blood pressure isn't sky-high.  I still feel awful after having blood drawn and the pressure check... I fear it is my rampant hyperchondria rearing its head.  Still playing  UFO: Aftermath  - its beginning to get difficult, which is annoying.  The missions usually wandering around with nothing to see, before blundering into a number of aliens who kick your ass.  Or occasionally, you wander around, see an alien, kill it, and the mission ends.  Odd.  The technology doesn't have as much "oomph" as its predecessor.  In UFO, when you got lasers or plasma guns you  knew  they were going to hurt - they were big, chunky and sounded nice.  The alien weapons in Aftermath are weedy.  The lasers actually look as if your soldier is launching a stream of piss at hir or her target... most uninspiring.    Even played a little UFO after I found a machine to make it work on... my "devil-may-care" attitude to troop mortality wasn't going down very well.  Its not my usual tactic, but I was in a hurry.  My second word of warning... should there be a nightmare future where I am a general, then you're probably safer defecting.
