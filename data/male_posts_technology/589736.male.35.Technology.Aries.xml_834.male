The babies are in the NICU, currently being treated for acute repiratory distress because of their immature lungs.  The doctors are very positive in their prognosis, and they should be removed from assisted breathing devices in the next 3-4 days.  After that, once they start eating properly, they will be allowed to come home.  Probably in 2-3 weeks, assuming no other complications.
