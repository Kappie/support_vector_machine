(the second one.) medyo nagulat nga ako eh. ngayong gabi ko lang talaga na realize na ex ko pala yung nag text. well there's a reason for it. i used to give weird names kse to some people sa fone ko. tatlo kse sila merong weird names don eh. siya yung d.girl.ilove.2 meron namang d.girl.ilove.b4 tapos d.girl.ilove lang. later ko na napansin sa kanya pala galing yung txt msg.
