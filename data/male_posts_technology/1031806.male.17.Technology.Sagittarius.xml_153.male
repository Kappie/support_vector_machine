I brought a large tv and my XBOX.  We (Goody, David, Cam and me) creamed everyone else royally. 'Twas fun. :)  Earlier this morning, I went to my orthodontist to get a permanent retainer re-bonded. Took like, 5 minutes, but I missed the first hour-and-a-half of work for it. Oh well, I'll just come in a half-hour early, tomorrow through Thursday.  Steven and I were going to go to a youth counseling thing tomorrow night called Teens Helping Teens, but my mom was at the facility today and found out that they had a recent schedule change - same time, but Mondays, not Tuesdays. I hope we’ll both be able to make it to it now that it’s a different day.  Ok, I just can’t post this without mentioning Gwen. (lol) I’m really starting to miss her now, and it’s only been like 10 days. I can’t imagine what it’s going to be like if she goes far off someplace to college for a year while I’m still a senior in high school. Hmm… thinking about that just depresses me, so instead I’ll think about seeing her again when she gets back. I might write her an email or two for her to read when she gets back, but I know she never checks her email... so it might be pointless. Nah, I'll do it anyway.  Listening to  John Tesh -  Goodnight Moon .   Close your eyes and drift away... Touch the stars in the sky on the way...   (the singer sings the rest so softly that it's hard to pick out some of her words, so I'll juss leave it at that.  Goodnight world. Sleep well. (Be safe, those of you north of the border... come home soon.)
