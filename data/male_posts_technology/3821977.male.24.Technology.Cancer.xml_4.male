Tell you the truth I was a kind soul with promise in my heart until Vanessa came along and slowly turned myself into an emtpy shell of a man. But I like to look at life in a more positive manner. You get lemons and you make... One would say Lemonade but really?? Do you know how many lemons it takes to make lemonade. Take the easy way out and use a 10Cent packet of Koolaid lemondade powder mix and lots of sugar and overcharge that stuff. Add some sliced lemons in there to give off the false appearance that you really worked hard and the $1.00 cup is justified b/c it's really that good. To further increase your profits, dilute the hell out of the lemonade. This sheisty idea has been brought to you by Martha Stewart Living and the fine staff at the Style Channel.  love you Vanessa, my favorite little sister --> now go make me some lemonade!
