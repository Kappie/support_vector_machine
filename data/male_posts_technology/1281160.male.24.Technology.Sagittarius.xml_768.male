I was exhausted. But when i stepped inside chowdiah hall where the concert took place, i just forgot everything and felt anew when i stepped out.   She is very good at delivering songs in tamil than in other languages. Her pronounciation is so crystal clear and she is highly energetic too. She sang Kaatrinile varum geetham, really classic and so many other songs, never to say, throbbed me!  Guys at B'lore those who get to attend any concerts at chowdiah hall, dont miss, its a beautiful auditorium, fully a/ced and the building is of the shape of violin. Looks aesthetically designed too.  And it was a non ticketed event and so the crowd was heavy, but then since the hall is too big, we could see people coming after the concert had started too.  Valli, welcome home after a long time! Hope to meet u, if possible!   Jax, That was something big and interesting too on semiotics.  I think manny is angry coz i dint list him in voracious reader's list.
