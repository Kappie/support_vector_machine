Watched the Ind Pak match yesterday. The Indians were far from good. Ordinary bowling, pathetic fielding and shabby batting. Sachin has yet again proved that he is not a match winner these days. Played a rash shot when the team was in a bad spot. Pathan was batting sensibly and all Sachin needed was to score some brisk ones and twos. The team had 240, the score they needed to earn a bonus point as their target and not 301. India should beat Srilanka to enter the finals. Tough job in hand.    Also watched Spiderman 2. Nuthing much in the movie except picturisation. Infact, the movie had some shades of Tamil and Telugu movies.     Am lagging behind in my CAT preparation. Time to catch up.
