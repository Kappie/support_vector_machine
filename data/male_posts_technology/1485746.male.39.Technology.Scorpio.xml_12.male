So, no PGR2 last night.  Instead, I played some Gladius (about half a dozen battles completed) and Munch's Oddysee. I was going to play some DOAXBV, but I inadvertantly left the game at my workplace.  On Munch, I just started again. I had played to a certain point last time and got stuck. In just one night's play I have gotten to that point and beyond.  The reviews seem to indicate that Sudeki is a bit above average. I'm still in wait-and-see mode.
