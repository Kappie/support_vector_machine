I used to think it was to keep my brothers and I from staying up late at night after my parents went to bed so we could watch old Family Ties reruns or soft-core porn on HBO. But you know how you start to believe things after you've heard them spoken of after so many times? Well, that's why I believe this story. That and the fact that I'm a grown man now and my parents still swear that the following events did indeed happen. After all, they never gave me a reason not to believe them. And I never gave them a reason to tell stories. None like this...
