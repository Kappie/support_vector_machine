They're not native africans but indian africans. the elder one just graduated with a law degree..wah..and the younger sis just finished primary school i think. Anyway, they were telling us they are not all of the same faith. The elder sis and the dad is a pentecostal but the younger sis and mom are Adventists. Now i wonder how that happened..hehe.  Anyway, in the afternoon i had to attend some meetings. Evangelism committee meeting..hai..seems like almost every saturday i'm packed with meetings. Anyway it was good it was productive as we came up with ways to improve our evangelism methods..it was both very fun and exciting...can't wait to implement it.haha..well there is going to be a seminar coming up in september by this guy called Geoff Youlden. He's from Australia and he has come up with a series of documentaries regarding life's BIG questions. Very interesting. Must go and see. It's free too!  Oh yes, another thing is i found 2 badminton players in church. Good to know who plays what so next time i can call them along or organise a badminton game.   Then in the night i went to celebrate Benedict's bday at causeway point...was lugging my laptop along with my bag..grr...not that it's heavy, but it wasn't comfortable. Coz i had my bag slung on my shoulder and my shirt keeps sloping down as a result so it makes me uncomfortable..grr..
