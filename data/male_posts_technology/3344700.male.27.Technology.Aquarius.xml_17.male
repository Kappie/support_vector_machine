When you do a search on any phrase or text, it finds results from MSDN, Microsoft.com or any related sites having information about Microsoft. For me its new finding and surprise too!  Check out for yourself @  urlLink   here     After noticing this in Google, next thing what I did was checked for the similar URL on Sun (www.google.com/sun.html) and IBM (www.google.com/ibm.html) it gave 404 error.  If you guys come across anything other than Microsoft, let me know!!
