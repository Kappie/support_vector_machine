       Finished reading  urlLink Mutation by Robin Cook  yesterday.  Run-of-the-mill medical thriller, with a father engineering his own son's DNA to be super intelligent. The experiment is a success - the son, now 10 years old, is a genius, but an emotionless one. And isn't it odd that several people whom the son didn't like all have died of an unusual cancer...?  I'm really just killing time here, waiting for my Herman Wouk books. I've read this book before a couple of times, and it's the equivalent of an entertaining B-movie.
