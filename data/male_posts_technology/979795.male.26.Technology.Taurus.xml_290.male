Had a hard time trying to finish my rounds with my SBO on. Shoulder muscles feeling strained now. Even my calves are aching. Got no idea how I'm going to run tomorrow morning. Prob let my RSM/S3 know I'm not feeling physically at my optimum and I wanna refrain from getting an injury before the actual run this comin Thurs.  Ohh ... my aching muscles ...
