I was away in Guernsey last weekend and I managed to get caught over there for an extra two days due to extremely bad fog!  Luckily my work did not ask me to use my holidays to cover the extra time off because it counts as 'Extenuating Circumstances' haha! Well I tried to meet some of the dudes from Gaia's Web shop in Guernsey for a drink whilst I was there but unfortunately I ended up being in the wrong pub, which sucked! Ho-hum nevermind, I got a stack of stuff to do but I shall post more soon. Off to the SPLASH for the first time this year, this weekend!  Baity signing off......
