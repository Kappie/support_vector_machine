As we near the end of the world of democracy and closer to a total corporate governance, many people wonder why the hell we even bother to vote.  We who do vote end up voting for the guy we fear or hate the least.  None of them do anything for ME as a person, so I have to choose who works with the corporate entities who I align with best.  And who has the least offensive platform.  Sad, really.    So, politics in the western world face two downfalls: Corporate control and lack of concern for citizens.  They all say they worry about Canada, but they worry about THEIR Canada.  Not the Canada the rest of us live in, those of us who don't take corporate handouts and have to keep big business happy so they stay here.  "Tax cuts for big business! Lower health care to pay for the deficit! Destroy arts programs so the next big nuclear power co. can get the funding needed to build it's facility!  Who gives a rats ass about the middle income and lower income working stiffs?  Yeah, they are the majority of voters, but it's easy...we just disallow any parties who would work for them from being in any media, and then buy all the advertising we can knocking the other guys who advertise.  We're a shoo in to win!"   Sigh...as you can see I'm somewhat tired of the way politics happen and the amount of crap i'm hearing from all the parties vying for the big chair.  Yes, I am oversimplifying things, and yes I am aware that political leadership does require pandering to many different interests...doesn't mean I have to like it or agree with it.  I am a Utopianist, indeed.  But I wish to maintain that utopic view because I truly believe at my deepest core that governments CAN find a way to look after both their people and their business.  Not to mention foreign affairs, which is a whole 'nother ball of bees.  I hope that on Monday Canada does not allow the bad guys to win the election, but it's kind of hard for me to pick out the good guys.  For the first time in my life, I'm probably going to vote for the far left just because the present far right scares the hell out of me about the future of human rights and foreign policy in this country, and the middle have proven themselves to be pretty bad managers with loads of fiscal irresponsibility.    In my particular corner of the world, I happen to quite like our incumbent MP Hedy Fry, but she's aligned with the bad manager group, and I gotta vote for the country not just my neighbourhood.  Hrmm...does that last statement invalidate the rest of this post about how they don't govern for me??
