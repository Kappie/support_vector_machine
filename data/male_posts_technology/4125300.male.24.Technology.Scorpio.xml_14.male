Regardless of any of these things, I know I must go with the flow. If I go worrying about money, then I won't be able relax, party or genuinely enjoy myself.  I think no matter what happens, the important thing to me is that I get a chance to surf (assuming waves are big enough). The good news is that some surfer somewhere forecasts this weekend will be a good one...  Been discussing some things with my girlfriend.  For the purpose of this blog, we shall call her CW.  I mentioned a few months ago how I really place a premium on my tolerant qualities.  While she didn't take issue with it at the time, my statement wasn't forgotten.   CW wasn't a big fan of my comment -- she would prefer me to appreciate difference qualities rather then to simply tolerate them.  I understand what CW meant, and in some sense agree with her.  However I can't help but feel that my statements are really being nitpicked.  My use of the word "tolerance" meant that I should make an effort to 1) understand that cultural differences exist, and 2) when those cultural differences are apparent, try to understand them and come to a reasonable comprimise.  I guess in some sense the reason I use the word "tolerate" is purely pragmatic.  I am most worried about cultural differences when an argument erupts, and a cultural difference is the underlying issue.  Will it be possible to appreciate cultural differences within this context?  I think she may understand most of this.  However I do somewhat betrayed, because I do try to understand and appreciate other cultures.  This isn't easy.  I've never left the western hemisphere, and in fact have never left the northern half of the western hemisphere.  I somehow don't view visiting Canada as much of an experience in cultural understanding :).   That being said  I am not exactly a home-body, but I' ve done virtually all of my traveling within the great U.S. of A. Think this blogging thing is becoming addicting.
