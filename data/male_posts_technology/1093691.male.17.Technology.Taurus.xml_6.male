The quaility isn't very good and the lighting conditions change in each photo, and I am missing one, and they don't line up,  urlLink but you get the idea . The mountain in the background is Mt Versovous (the one that didn't explode). The city next to it is Naples, and the town I am in is called Surento.  I think the fire fighers should wait, they will get more attenion if they wait until the stuff about Iraq has all gone, or at least got canceled.
