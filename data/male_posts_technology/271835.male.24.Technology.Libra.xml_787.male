First of all it just bugs me that Pele, as a world recognised ambassador for football, is succumbing to 30 years of everyone telling him how great he is. Any modesty he had is gone in favour of attending a never ending stream of parties under the nomenclature of "the greatest footballer ever" and it seems his analysis of football skills is strictly limited to comparing footballers to his own greatness.  Secondly, Rooney is not as good as Pele and anyone who says otherwise, including Pele, is talking tosh.  But  urlLink Freddie Adu  might be the real thing.  Doh! If I can't resist the Pele comparison then what chance does Pele have?
