We saw some break dancers performing, that ended up on the stage during the local warm up band.  Then The Roots were on.  They came out and the corwd got huge.  The place was sold out!  They opened with a set of their new stuff and then morphed into some older stuff.  Then after Black Thought had to leave (evidently he was sick and the smoke was getting to him), the rest of the crew blew up.  ?eustlove started off with a 10 minute drum solo that knocked the socks off the crowd.  Zack De La Rocha (formlerly of Rage Against the Machine) then took off with his lead guitar.  He Performing Iron Maiden and then topping it with Nirvana's  Smells Like Teen Spirit  that had the crowd rocking out!  Then came Kamal on the keyboard.  He took the crowd on a trip through classic hip hop with some Salt-n-Peppa and other way back 80's hits.  Then Scratch came back in the scene and took it 1986 style.  The vocal turntabelist threw down some Run DMC with the help of ?eustlove.  It was bad..."not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning GOOD!" So I was impressed.  The crowd was live, except for the kid who got high and passed out.  And I had a good time.  I plan on getting the Roots cd this weekend.  Beyond that not much else is going on.  I am missing Ann, but that was expected.  Justin and Tom hate my hair, again....expected.  Wrestling is on tonight, so finally a little normality in my life.  Until then...
