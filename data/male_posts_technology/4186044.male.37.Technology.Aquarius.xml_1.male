Typically, I'll answer "Stranger In A Strange Land", "The Foundation / Empire / Robots books", or "Issac Asimov".  I've changed my mind.  As a youngster, I was introduced to Dune. It didn't make an impact on me until David Lynch's "Dune" movie came out in the 80s.  I may be the only person I know who liked the movie (long and short version). It was easy for me to ignore the slight faults of the movie or the outright inventions (wierding modules?!?) and enjoy it for the spectacle that it is.  Since the first movie, I have devoured the remaining Frank Herbert Dune books: Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Dune Heretics and Chapterhouse Dune.  I've also read the new books from Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson: House Atreides, House Harkonnen, House Corrino, The Butlerian Jihad and The Machine Crusade.  These new books have increased my respect for the series a thousand fold.  Now, if anyone asks me who my favorite author and series is I don't hesitate.  Frank Herbert and  Dune.   I urge those of you who haven't read any of the Dune books to go grab them. Now.  And enjoy!
