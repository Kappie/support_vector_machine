Conan brings to mind visions of Arnold Swarz...(damn, i forgot how to spell his last name) Arnold swinging his sword chopping off peoples head in his "fur I just stripped from a lion" loincloth. And that is the kind of image I want associated with my bird by Krum. And maybe that my bird could be a great late night talk show host.. you know, if he really wanted to be.    I suppose the warrior side of him makes him what he is today, devil spawn! When I bought him offa some other people from the Baltimore area he was the noisiest of a pair. I thought the noisier one would be a better choice, since he should be more lively. But I guess he was just more ... evil than lively, or perhaps both. He is very fussy and doesn't want to do what I want. It is a lot like owning a small feathery pre-teen human. He loves my roommate, who hates the bird. But me, who loves him, he could do without. I feed him and (well, i don't clothe him...) water him and this is the thanks I get? hehehe   Maybe I should have kept them as a pair? He might need another companion to keep him busy. I just don't want him to be stressed out or anything. He wakes me up sometimes and I want to  kill him!  But I still  love  him.
