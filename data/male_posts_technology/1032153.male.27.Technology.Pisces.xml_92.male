Tomorrow I propose we celebrate one of the results of diversity. One of the sections of society that is not often given a lot of positive thought. This section of society is one which is directly responsible for all the ills we now face in New Zealand. It is responsible for abuse of children, and women. It is responsible for Maori unemployment and crime. It is responsible for the ill-health of Maori and Pacific Islanders. It is responsible for women having lower pay. It is responsible for failure in education. It is responsible for everything bad, from the toothpaste cap not being on properly to the fact that university education is expensive. In fact blame everything on this group. It might not be true, but at least theyâ€™ll sit there and take it, and still pay taxes and be a mainstay to the infrastructure of this country. Of course I am talking about the Middle-Class Heterosexual White Man. Yes Middle-Class Heterosexual White Man. Tomorrow is a day in honour of him who is the root cause of sin in the world. The real story of the fall is as follows:-  God created the world. It was full of mainly women (especially black lesbian women) and few men (but no white men). There was peace harmony and tranquillity with little talking (as indeed there can only be when women rule). Men (and they were mainly black with a few Asians here and there) dutifully followed the directions on home improvement, and gardening, of the head woman Helen. One day Satan tempted a man (named Jim) suggesting that if he decided to take initiative, and do his best, and even try to overthrow Helen, he would know everything. This man fell for the temptation. Instead of knowing all, he found his skin colour had changed to a pale reflection of what it used to be. It was white. Somehow this man multiplied and there became more of these pale skinned sinful creatures. So forever more, white man was a sinful blight on the rest of sinless society. And here we are today still struggling with the sin of Jim, negatively effecting the sinless sections of society.
