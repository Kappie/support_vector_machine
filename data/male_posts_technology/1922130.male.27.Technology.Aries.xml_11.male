I could do something more productive with my day, but I have a couple of good fantasy matchups this week and the games on TV should be good ones, so why not? Plus, I rode the Salem Lake trail and the Salem Creek Greenway on my bike (a total of 16.3 miles) yesterday so I don't feel compelled to get out and exercise even though it is a beautiful day.  Last night Ali and I went over to Tommy's for dinner.  Phil and his fam were there.  We had a good time.  Tommy makes a killer queso and above average burgers.   Afterwards, Ali and I came home and watched "In The Bedroom."  It was easily the most depressing movie I've ever watched.  One thumb up for good acting, though.  Other moves I've seen since my last post include "Josie and the Pussycats" (Friday evening) and "Spy Game" (Thursday Evening).  Josie was stupid but mildlly entertaining in part due to an attractive cast.  Spy Game was excellent, two thumbs up for a great plot and Brad Pitt's mullet.  Wednesday night Ali and I went to Carrboro to drop my truck off with her parents.  They need to borrow it to move some furniture.  They're cool, it was nice to see them.    Ali and I are starting a diet tomorrow.  I think we're gonna try the South Beach Diet.  Before you get all judgmental and say that those gimmick diets never work, you should know that it was devised by a cardiologist and a nutritionist  and is basically a modified atkins low carb type diet.  You can eat carbs but only fiber rich nonprocessed carbs.  The only other diet I've ever tried was called the protein diet and was essentially a less restrictive atkins diet.  It worked well, I lost 40 lbs., but it was not something that I could do indefinitely and, when I came off it, I predictably gained the 40 lbs. back.  Currently I am a rotund 6'1" 260 lbs and, unlike in my college days, there ain't much muscle accounting for all that weight. I'll keep track of our progress in the journal.
