They did a CAT scan early this morning and found that the original bleeding point in Heather's brain was shrinking down to normal size.  The latest bleeding point is still large but the doctor is truly amazed that Heather has responded to the heprin so quickly and  the results are better than he could have hoped.  Heather remains in ICU and treatment continues."  Thank you for your continued prayers and support.  Peace-
