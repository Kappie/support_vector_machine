This person takes the lyrics to popular hit songs, and translates it into proper English so we can see how ridiculus they are.  An example:   I wanna chick with thick hips That licks her lips She can be the office type or like to strip Girl you get me aroused how you look in my eye But you talk to much man your ruinin' my high   The author translates the above to the following:   I am sexually attracted to a woman with a curvaceous figure Who moistens her lips with her tongue Conservative or skanky-I don't discriminate Lady, when you gaze into my eyes I get very excited But once you open your mouth, it's all over    Cool. They have done this to several other songs.
