On Mr Lee's remark that bilateral ties were built on equality and mutual respect, he said the DPM had disregarded the Chinese government's 'solemn and just' position on issues relating to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. ..."    'Solemn and just' to whom? That's a matter of perception. How can they impose their position on another sovereignty? Ridiculous, simply absurd.    "... He said Mr Lee had also contradicted himself by first calling the visit 'private and unofficial' and then saying it was undertaken to protect Singapore's interests as he was soon to become prime minister.     'As everyone knows, Lee Hsien Loong has been in the upper echelons of the Singapore Government for many years. Hence, his status cannot be changed by such a statement as 'unofficial and private visit'.     'Furthermore, while Lee Hsien Loong was in Taiwan, the Taiwanese authorities accorded him a so-called 'head-of-state' reception. Hence, Singapore's explanation is not tenable.' ..."    I agree, DPM Lee's status cannot be changed by a simple statement. But how can he be blamed for the Taiwanese Govt's warm reception accorded to him? Would you as a guest visit a host, at the same time making demands? I don't think so.    "... Mr Kong's rejoinder yesterday was: 'Why should Singapore's rights and international standing come at the expense of China's sovereignty and core interests? This is both unreasonable and illogical.' ..."    No one country's international standing should come at the expense of another's soverignty and core interest of course. What makes the Chinese Govt see it that way? It wasn't meant to be. Of course we can't stop people from seeing the way we see things, if you choose to see it that way, well so be it. Your eyes aren't ours. Having said that, I think the same question can be put back to the Chinese Govt as to 'Why should China's sovereignty and core interest come at the expense of Singapore's rights and international standing?' Now this is a chicken and egg question and there can be no simple answer. I think all it comes down to is some form of common understanding and tolerance.    "... 'The current difficulties in the two countries' relations are entirely of Singapore's making.'We hope that the Singapore side will face up to the gravity of the issue and take concrete actions to win the confidence of the people of China.' "    So what is expected from Singapore? An apology over something where the only mistake was a difference in interpretation (or refusal to interpret) on the whole affair? That's not going to happen. Oh please, such stuff will be soon forgotten unless one party simply chooses to harp on the matter. Grow up...
