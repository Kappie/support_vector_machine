I had a pretty awesome evening last night, hanging out with friends I haven't seen for a while. Another one of my friends is engaged... I can't believe it. I guess that's what happens when you don't get a chance to see someone for 6 months or so... wow. It was fun to talk finally though, after such a long time. It's amazing what can happen when you just decide to hang out and spontaneously call people :)
