Not only are they taking their time in shipping available items but my Warcraft 3 disc which was supposed to arrive today, hasn't! And why, do you ask? Because the tracking number that was given to me was not mine! So here I've been sitting tracking this package shipped to Pleasanton, CA only to realize that it was delivered today to someone else. I call UPS and they tell me it wasn't addressed to me. I call Amazon (*much* better than communicating by email) only to be told 'Oh! Then we will just ship it again to you'. No apologies or even an apologetic tone! They cannot even trace that tracking number to see if it was indeed another order or whatever. In any case, I ordered these 4 items last week and am yet to see even one of them. I don't even know if I will get anything by next week!  In contrast, I ordered some books, CD and a T-shirt from Overstock and the order arrived in pieces yesterday and today. This order was placed a whole 2 days after my Amazon order! Is Amazon.com slacking? I hope not!
