I work for Licom Systems -  urlLink http://www.licom.com  Licom are a world wide player in the CAM marketplace, we supply software which powers many types of CNC cutting machines for applications such as   Milling Routing Laser Waterjet Wire EDM Lathe Stonecutting  As well as producing several production automation solutions for our customer base.   My role at Licom is operations Manager, which basically involves everything which is not:  Finance  Accounting Development / R  D Sales  Although being an experienced software developer myself, I do from time to time get involved in development, and have also been known to get involved in sales meetings from time to time (mainly to nag and moan about procedures).  The main objectives of this Blog is to act as an ongoing diary for myself, perhaps make a little social commentary while hopefully giving a little insight into how Licom work, and to maintain a bit of history for how things are developing here.  Anyone interested Licom and would like further information on anything in these Blogs in particular, please do not hesitate to drop me a line. I guess the key to these things is to keep them going as regularly as possible, so hopefully this is the first of many.  Chris.
