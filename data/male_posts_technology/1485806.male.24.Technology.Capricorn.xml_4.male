Brisbane and Perth have so much to offer a tarzan like me...i mean this is the first and probably the last time i visit another country overseas and be able to go there is like heaven. The people , the sceneries and even the countries...is so different to what i am used to.  With my aunties and uncles taking me places, marketing australlia like a product convinces me even further that it  is a blessed nation and a great place to settle and even my heart have set its place on Perth..wonderful place with wonderful people.  Of course, the pasture on the other side always looks greener and indeed the people , the leaders and the country have poured a lot of blood and sweat to form what i described as a haven for a greeny like me. Back home, the pleasure of what am i experiencing is non existent and things like the laidback live , the nature and fresh air is taken for granted and polluted.  I am even attracted to the churches that just started in UWA  and i would like to serve with the mat salleh to find out what drives them and to even potray the fruit of the spirit.  But the people, the culture and yes the food of MALAYSIA, is what kept me back standing firmly on the grounds of Malaysia. But i am definitely applying for PR there to raise my family unless God tells me otherwise.  I pray that i will be able to secure a job here to even raise some money so that i can continue studying post graduate in Perth and meanwhile serving the Lord as fervent as possible . In the process, thinking of dating a girl would n't be too far...either.  Of course, let tommorrow worries itself as the current times matters the most.   Life from my point of views is abundant , like a glob of kaya on bread, always taste good and will go on forever.  JOshua "Chicken" Tan
