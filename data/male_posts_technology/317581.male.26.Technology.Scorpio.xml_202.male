At any rate, I do know that one group will be interviewing in Seattle in December, and so I have til mid November to make up my mind.   I get to sleep in tomorrow, as I don't have to work. I'm down to 5 days of employment. I wish there were other projects hiring right now, but everything pretty much shuts down in the winter. That's life in the game industry.   Why does everything have to be on sale when the economy sucks? It's like, hey, everyone's out of work, let's have sales on things they can't afford to get anyways. Like people are going to be able to buy something when it's 10% off as opposed to regular price. Don't stores know that they don't have the money anyways? I guess it's great for those with job security.
