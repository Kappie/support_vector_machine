I don't really have too much to write about at this point, but I thought I would drop a line on here for those precious few who are actually reading this (I got your emails...I am updating this finally...but for the sake of my sanity...please just leave a comment).    The first of my summer adventures has come and passed, and I miss it.  This was the family reunion trip.  Things didn't happen they way I wanted it to, and we only ended up spending about an hour and some change at the actual reunion.  But all in all, we had a good time.  The cabin we stayed in was absolutely atrocious.  It was obviously a fisherman's cabin for the lake we were on, and the cleanliness depicted this fact nicely.  The beds were big and comfy, but they were brown from obvious years of use.  As for the funtime merriment...well, there wasn't much.  It rained for much of Friday, leaving us stuck inside with nothing to do.  There wasn't any cable to speak of, so watching TV was not happening.  We ended up going to my family's house and hung out there for a while, basically having a mini-reunion if you will.  Because of the state of the cabin, we had to get out of there, so Friday night we spent driving around, trying to pickup a cell phone signal to make a reservation to a hotel.  I know what you're saying..."Why don't you just go home?"  "Its not like you were far away or anything?"  Well, we didn't want to go home.  We wanted an indoor pool for the girls to go swimming in, and I wanted to stay somewhere nice and different for the remainder of the weekend, so we reserved a room at a new Fairfield Suites in Clarksville, IN (just across the river from Louisville) and stayed there.  The girls loved it, and we slept like babies that night.  So in summary...we didn't go boating on the lake...the cabin was disgusting...we only spent an hour and a half at the reunion...and we ended up staying the last night in a hotel.  Sounds like nothing went according to plan and I should be upset, huh?  Well, you're wrong.  If there's one thing people have come to learn about me, its that I love the unexpected.  Sure, I love to have everything mapped out, but I allow myself to deviate from that plan if I have to.  And as far as I am concerned, we had the best time possible, and it made my love for my future wife that much more.  It was great...so what's next?  Our trip to New York has been cancelled.  Cyndi's (my woman) mother has decided she isn't going to watch Cyndi's children while we go to New York, so this has left us in a pickle.  So instead of breaking the court order to not take the children out of state without the ex's permission (which he will obviously deny just to be a cockhead), we have decided to just not go...which is fine considering that it would have cost us damn near $1000 to do it.  Money well saved.  So that frees up that weekend.  What we have decided to do is take the girls to Lake Michigan to go swimming that weekend.  I think they will love it.  It sure as hell beats spending a weekend with their grandmother.  Other than that, all the other plans are still on and I can't wait....bring it on...summer rules.
