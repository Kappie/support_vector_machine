I like the people I work with, I love having my own office and I actually don't mind working for a large Catholic hospital.  My dilemma is that a job has opened up with my city's newspaper that is essentially the same job I have now, but it pays more. Close to 10k a year more. I wouldn't be living the high life, but I'd be a hell of a lot better off than I am now. I wouldn't have to scrounge for dimes and nickels to put a gallon or two of gas in my car. Ok maybe I exaggerate a little, but I am quite often strapped for cash and I'm approaching the time in my life where I shouldn't be anymore.  Next year I'll be vested at the hospital. My insurance is great. My boss is so easygoing I'm able to bring my daughter to work with me now and then and she can hang out in my office, or during summer holidays, my boss allows me to work from home one day a week so that she won't have to stay home alone as much. My paid time off accrues quickly, and if I'm sick, it's not a federal case if I miss a day. The boss and upper management of the hospital love me and have told me I have complete job security because no one else can do what I do.  If it wasn't for the pesky crappy payscale, I'd be even happier.   The job at the newspaper pays more, but I'd be working for Morris Communications which my mother has worked for and wasn't all that chuffed with. I don't have any idea what their health plan is, I'd probably lose having my own office... But the pay... :(  I can't decide if I should apply and face either rejection or having to tell my hospital I'm leaving, slyly let my current boss know I'm applying for that position in the hopes that they'd be desperate to keep me and bump my pay (which will never happen as in order to bump pay, Human Resources has to do a salary survey, management engineering would have to do a feasibility survey, and then they'd have to get a budget increase past Admin Council who are notoriously tight. Or should I just keep on with my current job and try to find a part-time, minimum wage piece of crap job that takes more time away from being with my daughter, keeps me so tired I dunno if I could function, and just plain sucks.  This sucks.
