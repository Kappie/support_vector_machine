DK is back with yet another blog.  lost count how many blog i created and threw away.  unlike real life, blog allows u to delete and start all over when things get messy.  so if given the option to delete and start all over again, why not?  if only life have this option too....    So here I am with a new blog, new start, new beginning.  HELLO WORLD
