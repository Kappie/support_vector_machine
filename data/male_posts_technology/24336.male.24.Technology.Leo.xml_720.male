Just today, I had a serious headache kick in around 2:00 PM.  At first, it seemed to be another caffeine-based headache, but my caffeine intake has been quite minimal lately.  Instead of trying to fight it, I just called it a day and went home to rest.  Though I didn't feel tired until the headache kicked in and I've been getting adequate sleep, I ended up taking a 2.5 hour nap.  I'm still feeling a bit groggy.  Let's just chalk all of these problems to stress and not enough exercise (at least lately) and hope they all go away.  Ignore it; it will go away.
