Didn't find an apporpriate time to talk to the boss about my pay yet. Will probably need to do so tomorrow. My mom was worried that they might be exploiting me, but I don't see it lor. Everyone in the office is seriously nice, but I do agree that the talk about pay has to be settled sooner or later. I guess I'll just bring it up tomorrow nicely lor. Seriously hope for at least $2k, but I'm seriously considering taking the job for a little bit less also. But I think I'd be spoiling market if I accepted something way too low.  Anyway, today was spent mostly troubleshooting PCs and some hardware problem in their office. I can only KIV it because after 1 whole day, I still can't say for sure why they have so much problems. OK, being a small company kinda made them really messy. But I can tell the boss is really friendly to everyone working there. Everyone is addressed on a first name basis, the boss included.  Went to BB East for Aikido. Was going to change in the toilet when I realised I FORGOT MY GI'S PANTS!!! ARGH!!!! .... Seconds later Alvin entered the toilet and I had to tell him the pekchek news. DOH!! Went into the dojo and everyone was asking me why I'm not changed for training. Oh Man!!! I received more than one suggestion to train in my jeans instead. I would if only I could. Sigh :( But sitting along the sidelines today wasn't a waste. I noticed a lot of points in Alvin's class. A lot of kokyunages from katate, morote, ushiro ryote doris, etc. Each one of them an extension of the previous technique. The things to note especially was centering, leading and footwork. I think from his past few lessons, he repeats these points almost religiously. I must say, I can tell what I'd be doing wrong just by watching everyone today. However towards the last 20mins or so of class, I seriously felt frustrated because I really needed an uke to let me feel what I'm trying to fomulate in my mind. At the end of class, I took the same bus as Alvin again. Always enjoyed talking to him about stuff off the mat because I always pick up some way to being 'Aiki' off the mat. Told him about not getting into the SPF and he was quite encouraging. I guess some of the stuff he's saying I know them as well, but you sometimes just needed to hear them from others to register it in your mind. Anyway was quite a good day lah.  Got back home and something nasty happened which I don't feel like blogging in too much details. All family related but I wasn't involved at all this time. Still, find it very hard not to be burdened by some of the disputes / conflicts sometimes. That feeling of loss and helplessness is very irritating. I don't want to be judge, jury and executioner but I think everyone was at fault. Even myself even though, like I mentioned, I wasn't involved. Shitz ... sometimes I feel that every problems I noted are related somehow or other to the material world. If only luxuries didn't exist and everyone knew the contentment of just living simple lives. An unrealistic dream, if I do say so myself.
