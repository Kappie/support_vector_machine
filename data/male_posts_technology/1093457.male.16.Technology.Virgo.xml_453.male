The fact most of us have 2 years of 6th form followed by 3 or 4 at Uni doesn't really matter, but you get the idea! Hehe. I'm actually nervous, and I know I ain't the only one! I've changed my book writing thing slightly, I'm going to buy a book with lined pages for peeps to write messages in and I'm going to use a blank book for signitures from random people and staff, plus I want people to draw a picture of themselves - just something slightly different from the normal thing. I have the photos from the skating, however I didn't use a fast enough film because the shop didn't have it, so unfortunatly they came out really dull, which I am quite annoyed about, but I have got some much faster film now - just got to try again! Jackie was talking about another Thorpe Park trip in July sometime? I can't remember the date, but what do we think? Anyway, I need my beauty sleep, about a decades worth, g'night.
