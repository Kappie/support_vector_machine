It's kinda funny how many people knew about it without the principle catching wind of it (normally even "T-rated" games are restricted from campus, and all we were playing was HALO, rated "M" for Mature).  It was kinda funny - we checked literally every classroom for extra TVs to set up.    All day (and actually, much of this past week...), Gwen and several other girls have been talking about doing something tonight, and little bits of conversation finally eluded to the fact that they were going to see a movie.  It was kinda strange, they would talk about it for several minutes, quite plainly with me hanging around, and never really once even acknowledging the fact that I was there.  Later, in our last period, Gwen and I were talking about movies that are out.  I mentioned  The Core , and she was like, “Yeah, I might see that tonight”.  After school while I was waiting for the bus, they were getting ready to leave, and a couple of the girls were like “Armaan, you’re not coming?” ...as if they expected me to be.  I juss said that no one invited me, and they left. I was kinda bummed out about that, cause it’s a movie that I really want to see… (of course, the fact that Gwen was going didn’t contribute to it at all ;) ).  So, now I’m just sitting here… home… bored… (lol)  On a lighter note, Mr. Weber (my Bible, and next year, my Chemistry teacher), and several juniors are going to see Anger Management tomorrow at around 2:00.  Then, I’m going to a bday overnighter at Matt’s house until 11:00a.m. Sat.  (no sleep, much Xbox, etc...).  Steven, Goody, Cam, Brady, Josh, and several others will be there.  Should be quite fun. :)
