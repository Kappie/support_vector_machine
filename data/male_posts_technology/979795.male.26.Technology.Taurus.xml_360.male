They were a bit too quiet and it made me all the more nervous.  Anyway, for yesterday and today, there were quite a few cancellation of classes. The feedback I had received was that everyone thought the updated copy I sent out last week was not confirmed yet. Anyway, not a problem lah. My second email to the school seems pretty straightforward liao. Things should work out just fine after this.  There was a fire drill yesterday. Daphne was taking a class of Pri 2s in her lab and I was in a separate lab doing my own work. Suddenly the fire alarm went off. First of all I tried to ignore it for a few secs/a min. But I found it to be too irritating a sound to be something minor. I immediately suspected some kind of an emergency or a real fire. I decided to pop my head out of the lab for a look. Most of the kids were lining up and moving towards the field. But out of all these activity, I noticed the Admin Manager standing outside Daphne's lab and being all calm and relaxed. That's when I knew for sure that it was only a fire drill. I walked towards her and I was thinking "OK, can check if Daphne had moved the students out of class already or not as well." As I neared the Admin Mgr, I did notice a standing board with fire painted on it. For a split second, my brain actually registered that it was the exact spot where the 'fire' started. But I still decided to walk right past it.  Admin Mgr: (sees me) Eh you just got burnt. Me: Huh? Oh, erm ... fire drill huh? Am I involved? Where should I go? Admin Mgr: Just follow everyone to the field. Me: OK (Decided to take a longer route to avoid walking past the 'flames' in front of the Admin Mgr :P)  At this point I didn't pop by to check on Daphne's lab even though I was just outside. I kinda assumed that since the Admin Mgr was standing outside doing nothing, maybe the class was empty and Daphne had already taken her class out to the field sometime ago. Not bothering to check, I just went to the field blindly like a sotong. When I reached the field. Our HoD asked if I had seen Daphne and I said "I think she knows, she should be down already." (Again, I'd like to use the army term 'You think, I thought, then who confirm?') Tracey suggested that I could call her to check. After standing around for awhile, Daphne was nowhere in sight. That's when I decided to call her.  Daphne: (answers call) Ya Aylwin, I'm in the middle of a class now. Me: Oh it's a fire drill now. Daphne: Ya but I'm in the middle of a class now. Me: Huh? ... (a bit lost for words) ... but it's fire drill. (Can't remember what she said right after but I just thought, maybe she knows what she's doing. Or she knows that she is excused from the fire drill.) Me: Oh ok lor (Hangs up).  At this stage I did feel a bit stupid. Thought I didn't have to participate and there I was standing in the field with everyone. OK, mistake made. So just went along with everyone until the 'all clear' was given. Then suddenly who should I see coming down to the field but Daphne and the class's form teacher witha bout 30+ little Pri 2s trailing behind them. OK that's when I thought "Heng ar... I came down liao." Haha ... I went over lor and they were commenting/discussing amongst themselves over the mistake. Later on I was told the form teachers said that the kids were all 'Chow da' (burnt). Well, was a comic day lah with me and the kids all getting 'burnt'.  Today I had some classes in the morning while most of the remaining ones in the afternoons got cancelled or rescheduled due to the same reasons I mentioned earlier. While doing my own work in the lab, a class I had taught before came in for their lessons. These were all Pri 1s and they were quite funny partly also because of the way the teacher was trying to handle all of them at once. There was this particular little girl who had trouble handling the CD-Roms and she was too afraid to ask for help. She was kind breaking down into tears quietly.  Kid by name of Vanessa (2 seats away from Cying Kid): Mrs Lim, Samantha is crying. Mrs Lim: Why? She's always crying. Why is she crying?  Now Vanessa is one hyper kid who irritates her fellow classmates very often. I think she's the one who wants attention from people (I posted about her a few blogs ago).  Mrs Lim: Yes and you Vanessa, you are so busybody that Samantha crying you also can see from your seat so far away right?  Now Mrs Lim is only saying this because Vanessa tends to do alot of inappropriate stuff at a inappropriate time. Always so hyper and disobeying instructions (purpose, if you ask me - just for the attention she can get). Anyway I was keeping my ears opened and I took a look at what could actually be Samantha's problem. I just saw a quiet meek mannered little girl with a pony tail and big round eyes staring at the monitor. Aiyo ... also dunno how to help her. From what I can gather, I think she just feels helpless and she's one of those who is too shy to ask for help. Pri 1 lah, I guess it happens. Anyway Mrs Lim just tried to explain to her that if she needs help she should just ask. I guess she's handled enough of such cases before to know that 'spoonfeeding' the kids too much won't help. It'll just make them more dependent and they won't learn anything.  Anyway a few moment passed and I naturally just turned back to check out if Samantha might be having anymore problems. I think everything seemed OK lor. But she suddenly turned over and she saw me looking over at her. I just turned back in a nonchalant way and hope I did not manage to embarass her. But I could tell her face and eyes were slightly redder than normal because of all the crying earlier.  Later I saw her walking over to the teacher and I assumed she had manage to pay heed to Mrs Lim's advice about getting help when she needed it. But ...  Samantha: (Whispers something too Mrs Lim. Too soft for me to hear over the noise that the class was making.) Mrs Lim: Aiyo, why do you want to look for your sister? She's not free lah, she's in class now. That's when I realise that Samantha actually has an older sis somewhere in the same school.  Haiz, I also dunno what I'm trying to say about the situation lah. Just think kids can be so difficult to take care of sometimes despite being so adorable.
