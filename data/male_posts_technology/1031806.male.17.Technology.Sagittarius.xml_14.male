Maybe she's true, but I take comfort in the fact that the worldly measurment doesn't really matter... I'm not looking to be rich of famous, just looking to follow God wherever he leads me.   Lyricz|  4him - Measure Of A Man  This world can analize and size you up and throw you on the scales They can I.Q. you and run you through Their rigorous details They can do their best to rate you And they'll place you on the charts And then back it up with scientific smarts But there's more to what you're worth Than their human eyes can see Oh, I say the measure of a man Is not how tall you stand How wealthy or intelligent you are 'Cause I've found out the measure of a man God knows and understands For He looks inside to the bottom of your heart And what's in the heart defines The measure of a man Well, you can doubt your worth And search for who you are And where you stand But God made you in His image When He formed you in His hands And He looks at you with mercy And He sees you through His love You're His child and that will always be enough For there's more to what you're worth Than you could ever comprehend Oh I say the measure of a man Is not how tall you stand How wealthy or intelligent you are   'Cause I've found out the measure of a man God knows and understands For He looks inside To the bottom of your heart And what's in the heart defines The measure of a man You can spend your life persuing physical perfection There is so much more More than ever meets the eye For God looks through the surface And He defines your worth by what is on the inside I say the measure of a man Is not how tall you stand How wealthy or intelligent you are 'Cause I've found out the measure of a man God knows and understands For He looks inside To the bottom of your heart And what's in the heart defines Oh, I say the measure of The measure of a man Is not how tall you stand, How wealthy or intelligent you are Oh, I've found the measure of a man God knows and understands it For He looks to the bottom of your heart And what's in the heart defines Yeah, what's in the heart defines Yeah, what's in the heart defines The measure of a man I know, I know   As  much as things at home hurt... make me want to cry(well, I am crying) or leave or just end it all... I take comfort in the fact that the Lord loves me no matter how much I screw up, and he's there for me no matter how far I stray. Well, I try to at least.... truly, it is hard.
