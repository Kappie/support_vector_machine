Perhaps I could be the one to give it to us all!!!    Well, sorry folks, I'm not that cheery.  However, I had an interesting conversation tonight and I think I'd like to share it with you. It isn't so much negative or positive, but I thought it was interesting, and if any of you wonder about how your Teachers and Teaching Assitants feel about classes, maybe it could give you some insight into their own thoughts and feelings.  I was up at my office this evening, grading a few papers, logging the grades and all that rot. Ya, did it on a Sunday evening, grades being distributed Monday. Graduate students forget that weekends exist, they're just the days we don't have to go to a class.   Regardless, a couple of other TA's were there, and also a TA who has recently been appointed to a lecturer position.  A big rumor has apparently started to come up in the department, seems we may not have enough financing to pay for all the TA's next semester, maybe not even enough for any of the Master's students to work at all. Being a MS student myself, this does indeed concern me. We all started talking about our alternatives. My head TA, a fellow who started the same time as me and who I think totally rocks, said that he'd heard of students who abandon their college and quit being TA's in the middle having a hard time returning to a program at said college.  He was afraid to go job hunting because of this, as it could require him to withdraw from the univeristy, and lose the good graces of the faculty.  At this point I began to wonder, "who cares?" I mean, if they can't support us to help them teach their classes (and I think a lot of you would be surprised by how much a TA really does for their students, especially in a technical discipline)  why should we bother to give up oppourtunity to make them happy? At this point I found the rift between myself and my associate. I did not come into the Master's program so that I could teach, I didn't come into it because of my great love for learning in a university setting. I did it for two reasons - financial asylum, and expanding my potential job oppourtunities.  He also came seeking these things, but would like to be a professor later in his life.  At this point - the person who is now a lecturer chimed in with "why I can't say that I know for sure that you'll be working next semester, it would still be a good idea to keep your prof's happy".  All of a sudden I wanted to scream.  you know, that warning lamp goes off in your head, your eyes cross, you get nauseated...  and I think. wait, he's a lecturer, working on his PhD, here so he can become a Prof.  Then it made sense and I calmed down a lot.  You see it boils down to what we're looking for. The lecturer needs his PhD.. that's all there is to it, he plan on becoming a Prof immediately.  The head TA - he wants to work, got laid off like I did, and would also like to be a prof (when he retires from industry he says). Myself, I just want the market to get better so I can go back to the life I had.   While we're all different on that, it makes sense, and we all know where we're at.  Here's where it got really neat though:  The lecturer mentioned how lucky we were to be TAing CS 1.  I immediately thought - what the hell are you talking about?  But the weird thing was that the Head TA agreed!  Now I had been complaining to a lot of my old buddies about CS 1.  It comes down to this:  They enjoy the challenge of getting people to learn something they dont' have the slightest understanding of.  I do not. I cannot stand the whining and complaining I get daily from the business students, the stat students, and everyone else. BUT I do enjoy teaching. I did it for free at my old high school while I was working at Worldcom. The difference  comes in that I like to teach those who are willing to learn.. who want it. because they don't complain that the material doesn't matter to them, that it is useless, and that they just want their C so they can go on. The people who want it are driven, or at least curious, and that makes all the difference.  What happens to us next semester? who the hell knows. What happens if we get job offers today, and are required to start next month? well, I for one would take it, tell my profs to kiss my ass, and go for it. I would love to complete it, and most likely would in my spare time.  The Head TA ? he'd be very conflicted. He's extremely loyal, likes the institution of higher learning, and wants to make sure he keeps the prof's happy. I told him to take the job, come back before he retires, all these profs will be dead or gone, and know one would be around to be mad that he'd left.  The lecturer? well he'll probably stay anyways, and since his Degree is being paid for, he doesn't have that much leverage.  One thing for everyone to remember please - TA's are students on top of your little helpers. They sometimes write your assignments, they almost always grade them, and they are severly underpaid. Don't blame them when you fail, don't make fun of them for looking weird (try sleeping avg of 3 hours per night from working instead of partying) and for the love of god, show them some resepect.  Out.
