Anne gave me a nudge, and I said "I'm late", but I wasn't.  My last item Friday afternoon sounds pretty bad, but in fact the weekend went okay. Not super, but not dark and depressed either. Yard sale on Saturday, we made about $170. Sunday was very lazy, sit around, watch movies, do a little garage cleaning, take leftover stuff to Salvation Army. Late last night, Anne and I "played" for about an hour - very fun, but a little frustrating due to nature's monthly visit. OK, sorry, too much info, but I think we've all been there.  I am  such an IDIOT ! About 8:00 last night, I remembered I had promised to help someone from the office clean out a storage locker ... at 10 AM! I SO totally forgot. I hate when other people say things then don't follow through, then I do it to someone else! I need to buy an expensive housewarming gift to make up for it. Any suggestions??
