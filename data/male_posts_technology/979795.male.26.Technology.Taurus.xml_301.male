The doctor would've referred me to the Singapore National Eye Centre but being a Sat and all, it would've been closed. He had no choice but to send me to the A So I went to SGH A where the doctor wasn't able to see anything wrong, again he referred me to an eye specialist. Well, after all the referrals and waiting (not complaining about these, I'm kinda used to this all thanks to NS), the verdict is that it's most probably a bad eye infection due to my contacts. First off I going to have to stop using them, second I was given 3 different type of eye drops; 2 of these were antibiotics and 1 of which was hand-mixed by the specialist herself (suppose to be stronger). From now till first thing Mon morning, I have to use the eye drops on my right eye every hour, with 15 mins between each different type of eyedrops. Was quite surprised because I didn't feel that it was that serious. But turns out I needed to follow this. The specialist even asked me if I could do it, otherwise she'd ward me in the observation ward. Looks like I'm going to lose some sleep for the next 48hrs until my 2nd appointment with the specialist. She was kind enough to slot me in first thing in the morning even though she already has a full schedule.
