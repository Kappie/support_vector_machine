I think it's one of my dictinct characteristic, consciously or sub-consciously, to try to please everyone around me - even though that means I have to do something I'm unwilling to do, to some extend.  After I've read Washingtonesse's blog, I have to say, it has inspired me a lot - not about all the sex of "important" people she've had with, but about the style of her writing.  Obviously, she is having fun writing her own blog - sharing her joy and happiness and sadness for her friends who cares or who share the same interest. (And of course, she's having fun with all the sex and the luxury things she "HAS" to buy...)  I couldn't help to find out that my blog has been... a lot of... CRAPS.  Who am I kidding, I'm not a writer.  When I was writing my past articles, I have a more general audiences in mind - basically everyone I know of.  However, I think that's wrong.  This is MY diary.  This is MY life.  Whatever I'm doing, good or bad, waste time or not, stupid or smart, it shall all be noted here, if I want to.  On the other words, the goal should be to please myself, but not anyone else.  And if anyone who share the interest with me, will come back to read.  For those who don't, I don't blame you at all - for there's nothing to be blamed.  Crap or not.  This is MY diary. Period.
