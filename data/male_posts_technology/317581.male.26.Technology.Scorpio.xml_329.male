Anyway, I sent an email to Houck to see how he was doing, and it turns out he's still working for  urlLink Dark Horse Comics  and he's coming up next week sometime. Well, as you may or may not know, I love comic books (even though i was never allowed to have them when I was younger cause of the devil), and anyway, he's gonna bring me some:) YAY!!!  Also, I wanted to point out that my friend  urlLink Nate  got a blog going.   So I just want to give a shout out to all my peeps and tell ya to go give Nate a visit:) Peace- T
