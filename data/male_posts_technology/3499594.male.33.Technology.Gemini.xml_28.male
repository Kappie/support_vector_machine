When I view nightly programming, in nearly every series I came across there are already is one or more gay characters. Some shows are already built around this lifestyle, like 5 gays helping a straight slob. So what is the big deal?    TV Guide quoted media stock analyst Tom Wolzien of Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. as saying, "It's about time somebody had gone after that audience with a [cable] network. ... It's an important segment of the audience that has traditionally been under-served. The money is certainly there to support it."  Article found  urlLink here .  Say what? Disney has  urlLink gay days , Rosie Odonnell is creating an all  urlLink gay cruise . All in the attempt to tap into this supposedly reservoir of money. No I think it's more than that. Since the media outlet, tv in general are already pushing the lifestyle containing 2 percent of our nations population, I really don't see a need for it. Already it's bringing controversy, which I suspect is the primary reason they mention it. 'Will this fly?'  Since Orielly generally blasts MTV for their degrading music this cannot help their PR. Many believe MTV has lost its true touch since the 80's when they went to reality tv and games. Showtime already hosts a number of 'gay' shows including, Queer as folk, The L word. So it's not really surprising.    Family advocacy groups are already putting in place a means to speak out about this.     urlLink AFA  a constituent of Family values has a poll concerning this already.  " MTV — the network which brought us the infamous Super Bowl halftime show — has announced that they are beginning a cable TV network to push the homosexual agenda. The new network will be supported by advertising and will be offered as part of the "basic" package of cable networks"  I also recommend you to check out  urlLink Traditional Values Coalition  that has some  good articles, ect.
