I am only about halfway done breaking apart their point by point criticism of the movie.      I figure out that if you take the number of people who approve of the president and minus the number of people that disaprove of the president that this gives you a value between 100 and -100 that pretty much shows what people think of the president at that time.    This week sometime I am going to make a pretty web page with graphs of the presidents since kennedy.  And one graph that overlays everything.    Going home now to fix a computer for a friend.
