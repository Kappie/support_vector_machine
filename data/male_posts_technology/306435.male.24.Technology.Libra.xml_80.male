I don't know the name of my team yet, as it does not have a sponsor, but our first meeting is March 23rd.  My manager's name is General.  I think that is funny. The beautiful 60 degree weather makes me want to get my gear out and start playing.  Actually I still have not go the stuff out my car.  I think I will today, just to make sure it is all ready.  Also, I am going up to Chicago this weekend with all the CS Club.  Should be fun.  Seeing a couple museums.  I am making sure to take my camera and get some shots for the web page.
