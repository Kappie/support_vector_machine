I say "free" because in actuality, you have to mail them $1 in order to activate your web space.  Either that or you have to send them $5 through  urlLink Paypal .  Apparently, there's some overhead of sending it through Paypal.  Anyway, this $1 (or $5, depending on how you do it), will get you 20 MB of free web space.  I said, "cool."  Then I realized that if you give them $37 USD, you get a lifetime account with 100 MB.  I said, "that's really cool."  
 
 So, not wanting to expend the energy necessary to find an envelope and mail it to freeshell, I decided to go the Paypal route.  Little did I know that getting a Paypal account is a lot like I imagine getting your own combination to Fort Knox would be.  To start using a paypal account, you must do the following:
 
 1. Create an account.
 2. Activate the account by clicking on the link emailed to you.
 3. Add a credit card to the account.
 4. Allow paypal to charge $1.25 to your credit card.
 5. Check your credit card statement for a magic 4-digit PIN.
 6. Enter your PIN into your account to activate the credit card.
 7. Spend money.
 
 Now, I'm all for security, but this may be overkill.  First of all, you have to physically have the card so that you can enter the security number on the back.  Secondly, you must either wait four days for the charge to be posted to your credit card account, or you have to wait for the physical bill to arrive at your house before you can start spending.  
 
 What kind of an online service is this?  I thought that by using Paypal that I'd be saving myself some time.  In actuality, if I had instead just mailed the money to freeshell from the beginning, I'd probably have my account up and running well before Paypal comes through for me.  So for future reference: if you don't already have a paypal account and you need to send somebody money immediately, don't use their service.
