It was like a mini rock concert - had projection screens, camera crew, the works!  I've always wanted to visit Hillsong Church because they are known to be one of the more dynamic churches around and all the techie stuff they do appeals to me as well. So yea, it only took me 18 months to finally get down there. Oh well... this weekend I'm going to their service in at their centre in Baulkam Hills, should be interesting!
