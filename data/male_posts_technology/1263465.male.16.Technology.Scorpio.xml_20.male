Earlier I had a major problem with XML, but thanks to a good person at kirupa, the problem was solved.   urlLink Mike  finally got his Gmail account, and told me he has been frantically emailing people all day.  hehehe.  Michelle's back from Korea (or has been since last Monday).  She bought me a 'Be The Reds' shirt because I love it so much.  *hugs michelle*.  Well, back to work.. almost done, just another hour...  *rubbs eyeballs*  I think I'll go take a walk...   peace out  //edit:  I filled up my 256mb flash drive with music today from  urlLink music.download.com .  I really like T1, as I downloaded all that music in less than 20 minutes.  Absolutly amazing.. Too bad they are artists no one has ever heard of.. :)
