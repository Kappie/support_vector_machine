 If your a Mac user you should understand  that "cool has a cost". I am headed to see  the Tablet PC tomorrow at a Microsoft  urlLink sponsored event . After researching both the "Tablet PC" and "Smart Displays", I am beginning to think I'd rather have the  urlLink smart displays  which will be available on January 8th.
