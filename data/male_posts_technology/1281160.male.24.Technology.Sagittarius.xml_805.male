Suriya's comedy are reality fantastic. Vickram does not have a dialogue to speak. I did not see these sort of acting from Laila in her previous movies. Manobala and Karuna's comedy superb.  Illayaraja has composed heart throbbing music and background Score. Each and every credit goes to Bala only.  "Don't fail to see Pithamagan once"
