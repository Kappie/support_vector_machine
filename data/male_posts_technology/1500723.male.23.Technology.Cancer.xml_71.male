Today In training Saw a person very similar to Olpi.. Who confuses every one with all the concepts he/she has learnt.. But the problem is she is always wrong wheras Olpi was always correct :((...  Best Way to deal with he/she .. *I think I am wrong.. May be I have to work to get some idea...* Thanks eos..   Olpi: I'm sorry.. But I guess I am correct :D...
