I came upon the idea of creating the Period Table of Wine Fault Chemistry, which is available for free download at this link:   http://www.vinterus.com/pdffiles/winefaults.pdf   [Note that we do have a full size poster that will be mailed when you register at our winerescue.com]  The idea was simple, but the execution was torture.  Luckily we had help from Sewickley Graphics on the artwork and layout... but the hard part was the technical stuff.  Obviously, we needed to lay out the major categories of wine faults and then create a drawing that aids the consumer in knowing how they would identify that fault.  For example we have a drawing of a stinking bulb of garlic for ethyl mercaptan contamination.  Ethyl mercaptan winds up in your wine due to poor or incomplete fermentation.  My personal experience with it is that it shows up when the winemaker is either hurrying a ferment or does not have the patience to work through a stuck fermentation.  I have about two cases of zinfandel made by a well known consulting enologist in Amador County that is loaded with ethyl mercaptan.  The garlicly almost cabage-like odor robs this normally highly rated wine of its normal flavors and aromas.  It is truly a flaw, as I cannot drink the stuff without Wine Rescue [shameless product plug #1].  It got much more difficult as I worked through the more subtle flaws and faults.  One of those is diacetyl (2,3 butandiene).  While this sounds like Chemistry 101, it is something that all of you chardonnay drinkers know all too well.  Diacetyl gives white wines the buttery flavor.  Many people enjoy this and like their chards as buttery as possible.  Therefore, calling this a flaw/fault was a bit of heresy for some.  I felt justified keeping it on the list as too often critics give too high of points for things like the butteriness or oak flavor, when the true grape character is either muted or hidden completely.  I promised to give some notes from a trip to Niagara on the Lake (pure business).  I did have the opportunity to taste some tank aged chardonnays from several major wineries in Ontario.  Since we are not here to plug wineries or to give wine scores, I am not going to pass out the links.  Also, we do keep strict confidentiality with our clients.  The point here (yes I was getting to a point) is that these tank fermented chardonnays were alive and jumping, and did not get taken over by either the oak or diacetyl.  Wine tasting is subjective, and we all like different things.  So when I call diacetyl (too much of it) a flaw or fault, that may not be seen as true by many chardonnay devotees (of which I am not).  The concept though of providing this periodic table is much simpler than that:   our mission is to educate the wine drinking public and provide them with tools to both enjoy and when necessary rescue their wine.  [shameless product plug #2].  Next week we will journey into a concept known as "foxy" wine!    Peace
