After I got back to Pittsburgh the night before last, I did some work and met my good friend Alan out at  urlLink Deja Vu .  We hang out there all the time - he has a VIP membership there and you get to know the crowd after a while.  After all is said and done, Alan crashes at my place for the first time.  My father gave me a bottle of cheap red wine on the way out of their house that day so we ended the night with that and some conversation.   We woke up and Alan left - he's waiting to hear on a job in D.C. and received a phone call about an interview for a job starting this Monday so he rushed out (he ended up not liking the position so is still on the lookout). Then, some of the things that I've been working on finally came to a head and got done...  (1) The latest version of my software was released to my users. It was a hectic release, but we keep getting better at this.  I wanted this release to go out Sunday night and it ended up going out Thursday... not too shabby - it's actually a record so far... thanks to my interns.  (2) A few weeks ago, my friend Jon was going to meet my real-estate agent, Jeanne to look at some houses.  On his way he totaled  his  Acura Integra (I totaled the same car when I had it and believe it is dangerous on sharp curves and wet conditions).  He drives like me so he was going 100 mph on route 376 out here... he came around the bend to find traffic backed-up because of an accident and ran into the road barrier at 80 mph trying to avoid rear-ending other cars!  He had some cuts and bruises, but because he works out regularly he was in good general condition. Anyway, I digress... to take his mind off of it, it was a nice day and there was a house in my neighborhood that I had been eye-ing and they were having an open house that day... so we went in and got a tour of the place by the agent who was... well... hot. She had style and a good energy about her, too. Well, she followed up with both  me and Jon later that week, and then she sent me a thank you note and some listings in the mail - really on top of things.  So... I called her yesterday and asked her out since I'd like to learn more about her  we'll be hanging out next week sometime - very cool.  (3) I got the e-vite out for the party we're having on July 10th after confirming with the booze distributor about the promotion they're bringing in and making up the initial guest list.  It was a lot of work actually.  Now we just have to figure out how we're going to get the DJ equipment and an interlocking dance-floor delivered to the bar that day.  Later, I met Alan out at the  urlLink Walnut Grill in Shadyside .  We had a few drinks there. I especially like the way they make me my 151 and Coke there - it's always just right!  Anyway one of Alan's friends came out to meet us and we spoke with some college girls for a little bit and then after some talk amongst us computer programming geeks Alan's friend split and the two of us went out to the strip district to Deja Vu.  But it was dead for some reason so we started looking around.   We ended up going to Chemistry which had a pretty good DJ spinning house music.  I ended up dancing - because I love to dance and because there was a girl I wanted to meet on the dancefloor (there weren't that many people there).  I did up meeting her and getting her number. Another college student (I've been digging the younger women lately for some reason). So hopefully we'll can hang out too, she seemed like a lot of fun.  Alan and I went to Primanti's and I got my usual - a capricola and cheese. I ate it on the way to after-hours at H2O... I'm eating and we're waiting to get into this place and there is this guy who is pretty much always a prick when I see him around.  Alan starts talking to him. Now, I always thought that this guy was just a prick to me.  But he's not... he's just a prick - period.  So I was in this very impulsive wierd mood last night and I bring up to this guy and Alan that he's always a prick every time I see him, and that I'm OK with it... but just acknowledged it about this guy in this conversation we were having with him. He completely agreed with me and continued to be a prick but we were ok with it now and actually ended up talking to the guy and making friends with him.  Which is cool since he also has a software company (as does Alan as well). So we all had shit in common.  We left before closing at some point.  I don't think I drank at all... just danced my buzz off with some stripper from Bare Elegance (she was off duty, hehe) It was fun. Then went home and crashed and here I am... ready to have some breakfast and get back to work.  Damn I can't wait to get my digital camera!
