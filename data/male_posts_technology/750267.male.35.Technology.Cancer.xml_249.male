Humility (n):  Freedom from pride and arrogance  Was it humility that made George Bush tell Iraqi insurgents to "bring it on"? (Hundreds of American soldiers have been killed since then.) Was it humility that made George Bush tell the world "you're either with us or against us"? Was it humility that made George Bush tell the United Nations "we're going into Iraq with or without your support"? Those are all very arrogant statements. This administration has pretty consistently shown it's inability to listen to other points of view, or accept that it might, just this once, be wrong. Wipe that smirk off your face Mr. President.  They also give the President a lot of credit for flying into Iraq at a time of active hostilities, as if President Bush is one of the bravest men alive. I'll give the President credit for going there. But give me a break. He flew in, in the dead of night with the lights off. He was there for 3 hours, and then left.   I'm sure his visit inspired some of the troops, and that is a good thing. But let's put his action into perspective. He was probably in more danger while he was in Britain last week than while he visited Iraq. I mean,  urlLink almost anybody  can get a job serving food to the President and the Queen. And nobody is giving him credit for his brave trip to Buckingham Palace.
