One would love to get his site in google search results. But for that to happen my site should have links on as many other sites. For this I had added a banner from BannerAdCentral banner exchange programe.   And hey you every one droping by my site i invite you to share links with your blog with me. On top right corner I had added a drop-down menu for Blogs. Now... that will contain links to your blog if you agree to put mine at your place.  :) Yup.. I am serious on getting a pagerank :)
