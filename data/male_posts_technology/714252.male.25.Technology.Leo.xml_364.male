Has some great stuff in there!)  Anyway it has prompted me to have a look through my old posts and see what has changed and I have to say that my posts have changed a lot over the last while..  Have a look at  urlLink this page  and compare it to some of my recent posts..  I need to start picking myself up. Work is going great these days and the company is really going well.. Soon I will actually be a successful happy guy with everything going for him again. (Someone even called me an Irish Hottie recently! Woohooo!!)  I used to use this blog to talk about all kindsa subjects like how a guys testicles move all by themselves ( urlLink See Tuesdays post Here ) and about my various organs and of course my missing fore skin (I know that is common in a lot of people but I lost my foreskin when I was 21 so I keep bringing it up looking for sympathy) and these days I have recently barely managed to rustle up enough energy to bitch about stuff..  K, I am going to have to start changing things around here.. Back to the scary posts about my various sexual organs and their behaviour.
