I was pretty groggy this morning and had the worst headache, and to top it off I puked, although it was just water cos I didnt have any breakfast.  The doctor gave me 3 different type of pills, 2 for my fever and one for my running nose and thankfully it seems to be working now. But I am still feeling really cold. Hopefully I can go back to work tommorow,  I have 2 days MC but with the amount of work that needs to be done I can't really afford another day in bed. Ok back to the bed.
