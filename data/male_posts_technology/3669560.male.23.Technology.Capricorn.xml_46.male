Looking back at my posts from today, I'm seeing a change.  I notice myself falling into good blogging form: writing some horribly self-centered crap then violently defending myself against friends and would-be detractors.  This came much more quickly than expected and with sentences that, dare I say it, are so staccatto as to rival my days as a trumpet player in middle school jazz band.
