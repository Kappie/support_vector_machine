In fact, I would believe a study group if they told me that health problems among the uninsured were due  largely  in part (20% perhaps?) to smoking. Sounds plausible, right?   Now you want to give these people healthcare?  Here you go, free oxygen, x-rays and chemo. Smoke with impunity.    Where am I going with this?   (Government) You know, we'd save serious money if these people didn't smoke. I know,  let's regulate it - no one on USAHillaryKerryKennedyHealthPartners can be smokers and receive treatment.   See that? They gotcha. The control of the State envelops everyone. I doubt those who are advocating for free healthcare want the gov't to tell them they can't smoke.  I'm going to point out to my kids what happens to you when you don't work hard so that you can get fixed at the hospital (not 'fixed', just..y'know, fixed. Healed.) I'll do that next time I'm downtown, lots of visual aids.
