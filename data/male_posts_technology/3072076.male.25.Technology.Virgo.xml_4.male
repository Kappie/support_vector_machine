Atal Bihari Vajpayee is a quiet man today and back to what he has been doing for some of the best years of his tenure at the Parliament; sitting on the other side, part of the opposition, now of course the leader of the tribe.  The congress has arrived and so has the scion of the Gandhi family and along with them all those dark horses who, in the recent past, had laid there fate to rest assuming they were already out of the big game.     This is India, where most of the people who have really seen India shining never care to come out of their fortresses to cast their ballot, which of course has taken an electronic metamorphosis. This is the country where people living in localities for decades don't find their names in the voter list. This is the country where a person can't vote because he does not belong to the city where he earns his living. This is country which does well at the international markets but whose democratic structure is governed by the mood of its rural population.   The verdict is out. The farmer is not happy. He has not seen what he was promised. A delayed monsoon, a drought in most parts of the country, no drinking water or electricity, why should he not vote against the NDA?   Rome was not built in a day neither do economic reforms happen by football rules. It takes time for a change to materialize and to translate to all fields. In my opinion the NDA deserved a second term but then that's just my two cents.  Wishing the Indian National Congress and its allies the best of the next five years.  urlLink Read More
