Anyway, was wondering round town last night doing some late night shopping and found myself looking at a hand-written sign entitled  "The Alphabet - A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P ..."  No, I wasn't in a nursey toy shop but in line at the CD counter at Woolworths! I guess some of their staff are having trouble recalling what they learnt when they were 6.  Surely if they imagine texting they'll be okay. Wish the photo had come out clearer but my covert picture taking skills need honing.  See you all out tonight!   [)amo
