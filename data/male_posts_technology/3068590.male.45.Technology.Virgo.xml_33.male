The most prominent news was Intel's announcement to ditch the next generation P4 desktop and Xeon processor development. Sighting the heat problems they stated that to resolve the problem was too great compared to the potential results. The solution is the ability to run dual processors in one chip design. Now I may be wrong but the IBM 970 and Macintosh G5 both carry 215 separate instruction units, I am certain that they will warmly welcome the future Intel competition. Just as the Model T is not used in transportation today the Intel processor will cease to be a viable commercial solution.  Microsoft has noted difficulty with their secure computing environment and has stripped some of the functionality from the 2006 Longhorn release. This environment in response to the viral and associated security issues that Microsoft is experiencing. As I have stated before, building the worlds largest structure out of toothpicks will lead to problems. The toothpick analogy to the Microsoft technology I think is valid. Now I may be wrong but Microsoft was using this environment to manage the intellectual property rights of MP3 copyright holders.   Apple announced "Tiger" there next iteration of the Mac OS X. This following on the heals of their SAN, Xserve G5, iTunes, New Powerbook models, Final Cut Pro, Motion etc. It would be unfair for me to compare these two environments because the Mac is such a poor second cousin of the Wintel duopoly, and no true computer user would use a Mac.
