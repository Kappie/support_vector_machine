Well after being there about an hour she busted out the papers for visitation I sent her 3 times and said we should talk about this.  I simply said to her unless you are open to the option of me having Karissa even temporarily then there is no reason to discuss anything as you and I both know Karissa is the issue.  Well that did not go over so good!  After a break she came back and said Karissa we should go to your house and watch a movie.  Of course that worked for Karissa so next thing I know we are headed back to the house.    Well she finally said look one of us is not going to get Karissa so we should at least talk about the visitation we can both agree to.  The reason she said was because she was not going to give me Karissa and I am not going to let her just have her so we would have to just let someone else decide that.  I agreed and we did just that.    That was fairly civil in the way in which it took place.  Oh and for those of you who called while seeing her in my backyard on the webcam thanks for watching my back and making me have an awkward conversation....You know who you are! :)  Anyway we seemed to have come up with a fairly agreeable plan with regard to visitation.  However, as we finished up she says if I lose Karissa I will have an issue with you having the house.  So here we are right back at a money issue.  I know it is not all about Karissa.  Karissa is her meal ticket.    She says I will not get fucked out of everything and get nothing after all I put into this marriage.  All I said was well we will cross that bridge when we come to it.  What I was thinking was not to mention all you put into everyone elses marriage as well.  She also says do you have to be at the hearing (contempt) and I said yes and even if I didn't I would be anyway.  She says well you know the stuff I am in contempt of you may just be in contempt yourself.  I can only assume she means my roommate after all she is up on three counts and I am not in contempt of 2 of them for sure.       Residing in a location other then Washington state or Texas   Not paying for the mustang in her possession     The only one she might have an argument on which still holds no real weight is      Being with a person of romantic interest after 8 o'clock at night     This one was filed meaning moving in with a boyfriend/girlfriend.  We filed it because she did just that.  I have a roommate which she found out about today! So I think she thinks because I have a roommate I am living with another man after 8 o'clock at night....the flaw in her logic is we are not romantic and I am not living with a man other then the father and I am not trying to make Rick the new mommy!  Anyway I am hoping for the best but I am expecting the worst!  We will see!
