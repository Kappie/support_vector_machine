I had told him to call me at 12 but i forgot myself :s. Neways, I had to get up. Took the call. Told him that the concert was fazool and all. Then, I remembered that I had to call someone. I picked up the phone. Itni baar try kiya. Par phone nai mila. Neways, mujhe yaad aaya keh aaj to Jumma he. So, I had a bath and ahd some milk. Then, I sat at my pc and checked my mails. Then, I chatted a little and left for Jumma.  After the prayer, I had lunch and have been online since. I chatted for some time with Hanan. And ive been posting at the forum and have been reading news at neowin meanwhile. I just called Ahsan and told him bout 2moro. Bichare ke parents ko us par shak ho gaya he... to the extent that, he cant even call his friends for more than 2 min!! :o Damn yaar!! Agar us ke parents ko us ke love affair ke baare mein pata chala... to woh to us ko ghar se nikal dein ge... ohho. Then, I chatted for some while. Mom got furious on seeing me at the pc again. She told me to go to dad at once and apologize. So, I did. Dad gave me long lecture. I promised to be good. And i meant it this time. I was so happy that he was talking to me again!! :D To please him, I did a few chores. He felt nice, I was hapy. Then, I went for jogging. Came back and went online again. Talked to Sana bout the sig. Got the pics. Then, I had dinner.  After dinner, I was working on the sig when all of a sudden, strange noises began coming from my hard disk. Then, after bout 2 min... BSOD!! :| Damn yaar... dunno wats wrong with my pc... i hve to chng hard disk every 3 months :s . Neways, i tried to reboot my pc. Didnt work. Kept giving the error: "Drive nor ready. System Halted." I was so scared!! I took out the hard disk. Took it to dad's pc. Attached it and prayed for it to work. Thank god it did! I backuped all important data on his pc including my huge songs collection. Then, I put it back in my pc. Didnt work again. Took out the RAM and display card. Cleaned the dust. Put it back in and voila!! I was so happy :D nothing was lost.  Neways, then I had some ice cream with mangoes. Chatted for a while. Then, worked on the signature late into the night. Meanwhile, the chatting continued. I stayed up till bout 3, but she didnt come. Neways, i just had some cookies and hit the sack.
