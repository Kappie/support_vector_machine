The little church we were going to is on the East side... just ten or so blocks away from my uncle's house. When we arrived there, we discovered that the service was going to be starting a bit later, so my sisters and I drove over to my uncle's house while mom practiced (she was playing for the service at the request of an old friend who attends the church). My uncle ended up not being home, so we called him and via his directions, met him and Natalia at a cafe a quarter mile away. That was fun, especially since I hadn't seen him in a month (due to his having been in Europe). We talked for a while, mostly about the impending divorce. I love talking to my uncle, granted he leans pretty leftwing-liberal in his thinking; he's got a good head on his shoulders and is very insightful.  My sisters and I ordered some breakfast along with them and only then discovered that the service was starting a lot earlier than we had thought. Eventually we got back to the church and quietly entered during the sermon... unfortunately for us, Mom and my Aunt were sitting in the very front, and I was wearing by far the brightest shirt in the building ;) Whatever, later my mom had us stand up while she introduced us, so attention wasn't to be avoided anyway.   Later, once the service was over, we got to meet my mom's friend's daughter Deanna her friend Patricia. Patricia happened to be their old foreign exchange student from Germany and was back visiting them (or at least, that's how I understood it).  Anyway, the plan was for us to all go to the Kabob Khaneh (Kabob House) in Beaverton, and my sisters and I rode along with Deanna and Patricia. That was fun... when I first got in the car the radio was playing Verve Pipe - The Freshman. Deanna and I immediately starting singing along with it to the other rider's consternation... LOL  We ate, walked around a bit, took pictures (which one or both of them hopefully will be emailing to me soon so I get them up here...) and got ice cream and Hagendaz (spl?) Deanna's dad had some type of PDA that had a hangman game on it... that was a source of entertainment for a bit too. (lol)  Deanna and Patricia are really fun to hang around... wish we lived a little closer to each other, though Patricia is going back to Germany fairly soon so that's event further than the East side (LOL) Apparently Deanna's an amazing artist... she mentioned something about getting space in a gallery on this side of the river that we passed by... I should ask her about that.  We parted company around 2:30pm or so and we headed back home, and Pat came over shortly there after. We set around for a while and eventually got some flowers and headed over to Adri's house (who just got her wisdom teeth out a couple days ago...) She's feeling better, but still looks like a self-described chipmunk (lol). She wanted me to take a picture of her and post it, but we forgot about it... maybe tomorrow or something.  Yeah and the rest of the day's been rather boring now that Pat left...
