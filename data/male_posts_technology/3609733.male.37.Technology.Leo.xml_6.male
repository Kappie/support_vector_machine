He had to go all the way around again to pit.  Came out 6th.  Nevermind he won under caution.  28% of the race was caution laps.  The TV audience will either nap or just plain tune out.  Gotta fix that.  Poor DJ strongest run of the year top 5 maybe 3rd.  But the new Ford engine failed him.  Work on it boys, he needs better finishes.  Ease up Michael - Rusty's brakes failed.  Robbie Robbie Robbie - at least it was Newman.  Kenseth deserves a large fine, points loss, and probation.  Spinning a guy out under caution is dangerous and uncalled for!
