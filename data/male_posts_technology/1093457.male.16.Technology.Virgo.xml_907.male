The main difference is the AS concenrates on the whys of thing, why does the economy work like it does, how does demand and supply work and things that happen right around the world. The AVCE is much more how a business works (as opose to how the world works), so it includes human resources, marketing and general business stuff - something which I'm finding much easier and will probably be more use to me in the long run. Unfortunatly I've had to drop Geography because of that (blocks don't fit) which is a shame - but you can't have it all can you! My NUS card arrived yesterday, and my Driving Licence arrived today! Yay! Hehe.
