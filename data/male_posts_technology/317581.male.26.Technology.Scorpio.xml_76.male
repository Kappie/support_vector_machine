So, I was like WTF.   Anyway, I hope you are all having a good one. I'd like to Recommend the book "Youth in Revolt" which is fuckin awesome. It's basically a look at the thoughts of a 14 yr old male. I found it true to what I was feeling at that age, and if you're a lady I think it's a great case study at the male psyche. Well, check you latah
