I tend to disagree with the basic principle -- that appetite is based on the volume of food you eat, regardless of the type of food. The size of the meal obviously has  something  to do with making you feel full -- after all, if they packed 1,000 calories into a single pill, we would still feel hungry. But there is definitely more to it.  I know with me, there are certain types of food that fill me up rather quickly. For instance, eating a 12 ounce steak is enough to keep me full all night. Eating too much bread before dinner often means I am unable to finish the steak.  On the other hand, I can polish off an entire box of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese for dinner as well. A box of cooked Mac'N'Cheese is 10 times the volume of a cooked steak. So why does my body treat them the same?  Also certain types of foods make me hungrier - for instance, when I eat salty chips or peanuts, I have to really stop myself from eating too many. Are you telling me that I will feel full after eating the same quantity of peanuts, Mac'N'Cheese and steak? It's not true in my case.
