Mostly because of games and movies: Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 Warcraft 3 Neverwinter Nights Sid Meier's Sim Golf and I'm watching all sorts of movies that my roommate Dan owns.  Tonight I watched... Undercover Brother, Pitch Black, and Life as a House. It's because of "Life" that I think I'm writing here, now.  My roommate presented me with a term about someone they knew. They called them "Asexual" which I realized is how some of my friends and I live our lives. I have this huge fear of rejection ingrained in my being. I think it's made me rather prude when I think that there's lots of girls who wouldn't have rejected a kiss by yours truly.  I'm 25 now. Still a virgin, although I think my mom doubts it. And I'd love to get a girlfriend and settle down. It's just I don't know how... T
