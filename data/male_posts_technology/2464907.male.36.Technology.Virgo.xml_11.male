In addition to being 5mp, the DSC-T11 has 3x optical zoom! At only 17.3mm (0.68") thick, this is quite an accomplishment. It also boasts of a huge 2.5" TFT and Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens. The camera it self is a piece of art, slim, sleek and awesome body. I did take a few pictures with it and was not very happy with the outcome. I think Sony needs to improve on the quality of the pictures of the digital cameras, I have tried a few different kinds but same results. Pictures were grainy and sometimes blurred, I think my Nikon 4 MP camera does a better job. Except for the convenience of carrying in your shirt pocket and good looks, this is one gadget I would pass on. Did you know this camera does not even have a viewfinder, you have to rely on the LCD to view and take pictures, resulting in a lot of battery drain.
