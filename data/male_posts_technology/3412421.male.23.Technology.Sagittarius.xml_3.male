Now, if my main concern is console gaming, what do I care about how companies did with their handhelds? And vice versa. If I'm a GameCube junkie (or "sheep" as they like to be called), I want to know what the bright sports were for the Cube, not the frickin' GBA.  In fact, with regard to console gaming, all that handhelds have succeeded in doing so far, are to  detract  from the enjoyment of console games. Any Cubers who were looking forward to multiplayer games over the internet  and are you gonna tell me that Mario Kart online wouldn't have been sweet?  can look at the GBA and Nintendo's push for GBA connectivity as the reason why it ain't happenin' for you. (Yeah, I know about Phantasy Star Online, where you've got to pay a monthly fee, and I'm also aware of the half-assedness of Warp Pipe.)  Then you have Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. Inarguably made worse by Nintendo trying to cram GBA connectivity down people's throats. Problem is, a lot of people just want to play their console games, not be practically forced into buying extra GBAs just to make it remotely fun  one Japanese publication even gave the single player aspects  a negative score !  Now you see why I separate these things out?
