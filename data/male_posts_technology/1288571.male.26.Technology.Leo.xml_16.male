So hey, I'm getting one helluva sweet tax return this year.  What does that mean?  Oh, well let me tell you (and especially repeating this just for Dazzla hahaha). At the end of this month, I will be purchasing:  1) The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker 2) The new Gameboy Advance SP  (read about it people!) 3) Metroid Fusion 4) Gameboy-Gamecube link cable  Wha? Me a Nintendo whore? Abso-friggin-lutely!  muahaha
