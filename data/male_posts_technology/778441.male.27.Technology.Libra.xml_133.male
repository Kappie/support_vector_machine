According to an article in the  Communications of the ACM , three scientists from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in the US, have proposed the use of DNA in genetically modified bacteria to store information.  The article states that,  For very long-term storage and retrieval, encode information as artificial DNA strands and insert into living hosts. As vectors, bacteria, even some bugs and weeds, might be good for hundreds of millions of years.    sheesh! ... and I thought, the  good  bacteria could only turn milk into curd!! ;-)
