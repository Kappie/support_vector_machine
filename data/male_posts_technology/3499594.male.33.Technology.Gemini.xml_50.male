Yesterday evening, as I was leaving the office I received a call. I felt I better answer. BOS ( Buisiness Office ) at Corporate had a few in the room on a conference call to me. They explained to me that another facility had an issue with charges. Seems this hospital had not been looking at their charges for the past 7 days and was missing revenue.   What's the deal with these people? Seems no-one looks at their daily reports till its too late then expect IS to clean it up. Anyway, last night I spent nearly 2 hours creating a new interface to move the files over for the hospital to recapture their missing charges.   I asked my wife, what was the deal? Am I the revenue man or what?   We have today and tomorrow, then have to drive to San Antonia, Saturday. My wife is catering a wedding Saturday and we plan to leave afterward. I am ready to get off this roller coaster ride.
