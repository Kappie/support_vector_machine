I hung with zach, kat, and of course Heather. We did not do much really, except hang out. i wish brando could have been there. Anywho, i asked Heather out as i took her home after the fair friday night. Made for a good car trip. Lets see, saturday i drove to branson to help somebody vidoe a wedding that was fun. Then came home and met Heather and Phronsie at the fair again. Although i liked Saturday alot, although we were bored out of our minds, me and heather had a nice time. our friends were bored, while me and her were acting as a regular couple more or less. Then this morning i went to church met some indians who were very spirit filled and a lot of fun. They were doin the service this morning. I guess the rest is bliss.
