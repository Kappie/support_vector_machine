But the assclowns (I.E. = Adam/Eric/Justin) dont seem to get the picture that you need to give the good healer (me) items and stuff to keep them happy. otherwise, they let you die. he he he. And they also dont get the picture that you need to combine spells to get better spells. I.E. Life + Fire = Holy.  Cure + Cure = Curega.  [Confused? Call 525-2477 for free myrhh]
