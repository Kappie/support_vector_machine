The first one is the best. It's a about one night in an hotel where the paths of the hotel clerk and the people in four rooms each on the same floor cross each other.  In the first room there are two people: a jealous guy who has drugged his ex-girlfriend, drenched her in gasoline, and is planning to set her on fire but his lighter isn't working... So he calls the clerk to get him some matches.  In the second room two lovers are meeting, the woman, who is married, has been followed by her husband who intends to catch them in the act.  In third room three gangsters and their boss hang out. The boss has recently had an attempt on his life made by a special killer only using a screw driver. The attempt failed and now they prepare for the killer to try again. Also, the boss has clogged the toilet, so they call the clerk to have him fix it. He can't so they call a plumber...  Finally, the fourth room, is where the screw drive killer resides.   It's a dark comedy with some pretty funny lines and alot of deaths, some of them unexpected.  The other two stories are more dull, one is about a boy's wish for a pair of Nike shoes, the other one about a man and a married woman meeting, where both of them liked each other when they were in school. It's ending is quite funny, though. It has a funny twist on the traditional scene of a goodbye at the train window and people saying heartfelt things they wouldn't normally because the train is just about to leave...  -->
