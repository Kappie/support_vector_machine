It would appear to me to be acceptable for the American soldiers to be treating the Iraqi's in the manner that they are.  Although I realize it is inconsistent with the Geneva convention regarding war criminals, it is better then what the American soldiers should have done to those people. (just shoot them next time, and skip the problems). And I am certain they are being treated far better then they were "dishing" it out over the past 25 years to their victims. Those being the innocent women and children that did not follow the rule of law under So Damned Insane.  These alleged humans, the Iraqi prisoners, are the primary reason that a dictator has the ability to keep power for their own purposes.
