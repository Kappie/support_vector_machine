It's not so bad that I need to spend a week in bed but it definitely gave me pause to consider giving up basketball.  I ask you, why do I have to turn my ankle so frequently?  Actually, why do I need to turn my ankle at all?  Yesterday would have been a good day if I hadn't a.) forgotten my inhalor and b.) sprained my ankle.  Today is looking up though.  I made it in to work "early," we have a brand meeting this morning in which I hope to hear good news about our progress, and tonight I'm going to see Return of the King.  Hopefully the swelling in my ankle will subside to complete the day.  Wish me luck.
