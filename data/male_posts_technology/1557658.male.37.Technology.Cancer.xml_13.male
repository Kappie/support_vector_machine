But, oddly, she didn't have any cash to treat the family (my 2 bro's were there also) to goodies and, surprise, my brothers didn't have any cash on them, so I forked over $40.   As for the movie, I thought it was as good as the first one. Except that Pete took off his mask too much. As we were walking out, my 6-year-old boy (who just had  his  b-day too) says to me "Can we come back again tomorrow?" Guess he liked it!  In case you didn't notice, I'm making a bunch of posts in one day to give the illusion that I update my blog frequently. Is it working?
