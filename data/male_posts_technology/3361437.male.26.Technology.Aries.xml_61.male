'Some people have been waiting all their lives for this. Nobody alive has seen it,' said astronomer Peter Boyce, who plans to watch the 'transit of Venus' from Massachusetts' Nantucket Island.
People across much of the Earth will be able to see it, but it won't be visible in the western United States. In the Midwest and East, viewers can watch its final stages for a couple hours starting at sunrise, if skies aren't clouded over."
