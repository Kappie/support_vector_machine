With my teeth, my car needing a service and my mums divorce, I haven’t been rolling in the money recently and I went 20 quid overdrawn. So. I don’t realise this until I try to take a tenner out to get some lunch. The cash machine rejects me, so I try another, and the same again. I go into the bank and chat with them. They froze my card because I was overdrawn. Fair enough I think. “Can I have an overdraft then?” “No” they say.  “Why?” I question?  “The system says you have a bad debit history” they say. “Its because of your credit cards” they say.  “I haven’t had a credit card since I was at Uni, I had a bit of trouble but it got cleared. Besides, I thought you kept that only for six year?” “We do”, they say. “We shall check with card services”, they say.  After a phone call, they tell me that card services have indeed cleared the bad debit record at the beginning of this year. They only hold the information for six years. “That’s nice” I say. Can I have an overdraft? “No” they say, “You have a bad debit history.” “But you just told me that it was cleared?” I cry. “Yes, on Card services, We hold the information permanently.” They tell me. “But if I cant have an overdraft, that means I could never get a loan or mortgage?” “That’s correct.” “But that means a simple student mistake that makes a student go 600.00 quid in debt (on a five hundred limit) stiks for the rest of that students life?” “That’s correct.”  HSBC???  THEY ARE RIGHT BASTARDS !!!
