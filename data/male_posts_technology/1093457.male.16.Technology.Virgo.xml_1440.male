I admit if you put me there I'd suck but then again I suppose if you practise to the extent and all that they do then yea you would be better than others but I really cannot see the skill or talent involved. I know its a part of the police's job to deal with rioting but I don't see why people need to turn around and have a go at the police when all they are doing is trying to stop the rioters damaging too much property and from injuring other people.  I tend to get really pissed off when people slag off the police which if what hooligans and such do because they are doing their job. Its not like they go out of their way to spoil their fun or whatever, its their job as you say and I wish that people would think twice before doing something which can injure or kill a police officier, what about their families and such? Shame people don't think much these days.
