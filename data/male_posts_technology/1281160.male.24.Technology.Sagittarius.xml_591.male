BTW, xavier called to KPN travels and informed that i m on the way and asked them to wait for me. i not even told his mom abt her samaiyal and left the place.  xavier dropped me in KPN travels exactly when the bus was abt to start. omitting bala and rajesh from the scene, i had a very nice time in coimbatore. xavierukku romba nandri kadan pattirukken.  this morning around 7.30am i reached chennai safely.   intha kadhai ithudan mudinthathu. ithil kurappatta sambavangal anaithum unmaiyae. so ithu yaar manathaiyum punnakkinaal, marunthu poda kaasu kodukka pada maattathu.
