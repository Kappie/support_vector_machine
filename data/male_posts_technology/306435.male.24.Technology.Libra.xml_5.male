It is funny how Kristin and I have developed such a deep relationship over the internet.  I think that bothers her.  She studied a lot about communication in school, and thinks that Email/Instant Messaging is one of the poorest forms of communication.  The thing is I have gotten to know more about her over the last four and a half years through constant email and IMs than any other person I know.  She just started a new job in Louisville this past week at the Associated Press.  She now works in the same building with my dad.  At one time this would have upset me, my worlds colliding like that, but I am okay with it now.  I guess that is a sign of my maturity.  Anyway at her new job she spends Friday and Saturday nights taking the scores of high school football games over the phone, which I believe she then publishes on the AP Wire (if I am wrong I know she will correct me....that is what she does for a living).  So the two hours that the games are going on she just waits by the phone.  She got on AOL and we talked for a time.  Justin and I went to First watch for brunch this morning.  He had some fruity thing and I had french toas, it was good.  While waiting the half hour for a table we stopped by the book store.  I found two boooks by JD Salinger that I have never read.  I think I am going to stop by the library and see if I can get one of them.  They were only in hard back at the store, and I didn't have the thirty bucks to buy one.  I flipped through a copy of  Nine Storeis  which reminded me I need to get my copy back from Cara (cough).  When we got back I had a post card from Ann waiting.  She has been in Idaho for the past week.  She said she is having a good time.  Evidently they had to cut there 40 mile journey off for health reasons (didn't explain much more than that), but they were having fun in the city.  She should be home late Sunday/early Monday.  I can't wait for her to get back.    I am not sure what the plans are for tonight.  I am sure Justin has something up his sleeve...of course I thought that last night too.  He is off RolePlaying at Lances house (yes I said Lance...it weirded me out too), but he should be back soon.  Tomorrow we are hitting the Red's game and then the WWF PPV Summer Slam with Tom.  Until then...
