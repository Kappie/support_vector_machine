I'm doing some reading too... but those are predominantly satirical in nature... not stories or fiction or poems but articles/write-ups ranging from comments on the bygone days to certain issues/topics of my personal interest... they are certainly helping me look at things with a "different" perspective... a down-to-earth understanding of things which are so obvious yet difficult to comprehend. This certainly is a unique experience am undergoing... and my interest towards such reading is only increasing as I read more of them... hope to share a few things with u too...
