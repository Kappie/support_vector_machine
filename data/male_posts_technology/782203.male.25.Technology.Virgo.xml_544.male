Basically this is how it seems to work; people send in their pictures, and the public gives them a rating from 1 - 10 based on their pictures.  Gotta give props to the people who sent in their pictures, especially those that aren't that great looking. I mean you have to feel a bit sucky if you get a rating of less than 5 right. Oh Audrey joined as well, think she has a pretty decent shot of winning it.
