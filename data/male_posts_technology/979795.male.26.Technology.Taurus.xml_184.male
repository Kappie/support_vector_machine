Well it's new lah following a split [which formed the Aikido Federation (Singapore)]. Anyway a lot of political shitz inside that which I dunno, so ... no comments. Was just to Aikido ShinJu-Kai's website too. Now I realised that the 2 of these clubs now have the 'history' section. Heh. The latter's used to be very very brief, while the former had absolutely none.  I dun mean to criticise lah of coz, but I noticed there's this sudden outburst of 'Singapore's Aikido History' available online. I'm happy to have put up Aikido in Singapore's history online (at http://www.geocities.com/Aikido_in_Singapore ... aiya muz promote my site mah hehheh) before ShinJu-Kai's new history updates and Aikikai's new site. Hope that helped to kinda poke more people to put the info online and made readily available to the general public. I'm sure that there must be a lot of people who have already wanted to do this. Also realised everyone have a slight version of their own 'truth'. Doesn't matter to me. Think when all the info is put out, the public themselves can read and then formulate their own opinions and ideas on the subject.  Personally I have a few views about the various club's sites I think. I analysed them through the following, overall look/design, content, navigation.  Aikido Fed's is simple to use. Nice comfortable look. But maybe because it's still new, it has a somewhat empty look. Should get better with time. Use of white and dark blue color is good and relaxing to the eyes. Doesn't take long to load. Better use of fonts may enhance the site further. Might help to include some history, but being a new club (and maybe coz of the unpleasantness from the split with Aikikai Singapore) think the lack of info now is coz they're trying not to offen anyone. I'd think a 3.5/5 is fair. Content probably only a 3/5 but it's simple to use design pulled it to a 3.5.  Aikikai's site looks 'stiff' (??). Dunno how to describe also. But I think it's also because it's still a new site. Weird color combination. Looks like they are trying hard to 'structure' their content at the moment. Heard that they were working on something 'good' few mths ago, but it looks crappy. Think the NUS aikido site is still better. Might have helped if they worked on it from there. But the info is still OK for a new site. Should get better with time. 3/5 grade maybe? It's design deserves a 2.5/5 though but the content kinda pulled it up a bit.  Ueshiba's can be better. They are quite a laojiao club but still very poorly established online. Maybe that's not their emphasis that's why. They're probably more focused on training and other forms of expansion instead. But I figure that in ths modern day and age, the development of a proper website is extremely important. They have a link with Ngee Ann poly's Aikido site. Both sites basically show the same stuff. Quite pointless to maintain 2 pages like that. May be better to crosslink some info pages to allow 1 update only. But this may slow down surf time for one of the site. Alternatively, they may want to use some kinda of FTP update facility to make auto updates/publishing. Either way, for a club that 'old' the site is quite crappy. Their content is OK. A history section would be nice though not really necessary. But I think George Chang Sensei runs the club very niely. Dunno, juz my impression of the club. 3/5.   Yushinkai is a new site as well, looks comfortable enough but can still be improved. Fonts can be improved. 3.5/5 coz of the nice feel it gives. Doesn't look messy.  Ki-Aikido's has a nice site, but they look a bit too cramped. Content is very very good. Only site which included video clips. Thumbs up on this point. Structure of the site content seems ok but feels a bit weird. Not sure why. But content more than makes up for it. Including history of Ki Aikido (being the only Ki sch) would be very very nice. 4/5.  ShinJu-Kai has by far the best site established online. Anyone looking for Aikido in Singapore will definitely like their site more. They are extremely well organised. Content is very good. 5/5 score.  Hope I dun offend anyone with these frank opinions. Hey, I'm no expert but I think even layman have got opinions. My site isn't that fantastic either. I'm so envious of Aikido clubs with impressive looking sites. Dun think I can ever reach that stage for my site. Think for an Aikido site to excel, including history and background is necessary. Also need to project a professional image and that's why how the site is designed is very impt. Of coz, Aikido is not about website building lah. But website helps the spread of the art.
