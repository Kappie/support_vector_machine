Feels like poeming:    Sha-la-la-la-la-la   as the rearmost day approaching   my heart grew both lighter and deepener    Sha-la-la-la-la   lighter because I'm leaving   leaving this wearysome job once and for all    Sha-la-la-la   deepener because I'll miss   miss my fair monitor and friendly colleagues    Sha-la-la   but I have to go   for there are things I must do and must go do it    Sha-la   goodbye my desk   goodbye my office and goodbye HP    Sha.............  接不下去ㄌ...  果然還蠻沒有天份ㄉ...
