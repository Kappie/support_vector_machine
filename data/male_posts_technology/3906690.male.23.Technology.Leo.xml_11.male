"He's doing good...really good to be exact...just wish he realizes the place he's at isn't good for him," I responded. He responded with "I saw that girl’s mom and she asked if I knew about Brandon...I told her no I didn't.” He then said “she said this is what happened...”...I tried to tell her “No, don’t say that to me...but she kept saying it to me in my face...and I told her that it was probably his girlfriend and your family that made him do it.” Her response he says was “No, it’s not our fault...it’s his family...” After he said this I thought “here we go with the blaming again.” I mean the way I see it my brother is fully brainwashed...under that girl and her family’s control or whatever. He believes what they tell him...it’s a bunch of bullshit that’s all I can say. Every person we talk to say the same thing, “Why is he out there with that family? That family is no good...etc.” Wish I could say more, but I’ll just leave it as that.  Oh yea, I now know what it's like going from low E to high E then back to low E...it's amazing what one can do with a guitar.
