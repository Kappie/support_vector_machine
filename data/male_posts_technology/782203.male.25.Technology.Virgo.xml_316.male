I do have a tendency to get upset when people criticize me in a harsh manner or make really nasty comments. I try not to be (or show it)  of course, but it does really affect me. Call it a lack of self-confidence or whatsoever, but I am very very concerned about what people think of me, especially people I consider my friends.  Maybe because I know I don't have that many to begin with.
