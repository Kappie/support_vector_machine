 I think this is a good idea.  I think McCain would have been a better selection, but there's no way he's going to associate himself with the Democrats.  He wants to be president one day, which requires party backing, which requires him to not alienate the republicans.  That's why you saw him sliding closer and closer to the republicans as the democrats tried harder and harder to woo him away.
 
 Edwards is a good pick for  urlLink Kerry .  He balances out the hardcore liberal image that the Bush administration has been trying to paint on Kerry.  I think that he will strengthen the Kerry ticket (which is completely rediculous considering that the VP has the least job responsiblities of all elected officials), so I'm glad he's on board.
