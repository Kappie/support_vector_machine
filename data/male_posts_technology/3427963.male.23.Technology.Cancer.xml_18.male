Hy says that the weekends passes fast is cos u enjoy the weekend but i beg to differ though. Cos i usually sleep away my weekends, hahaha :) Always sleep late on friday nites and then sleep til ard 2 to 3 on sat afternoon, wat fucking waste....i always feel but arent weekend suppose to be meant for u to rest?? And i realli wish i can see Hy more often lor.....she always seems so busy, wif her work and studies, feel that she dun even have time for herself. Not to mention that she have so many frens queueing up to meet her. Well, when u love someone, u have to accept who and wat she is and i love her so i have to accept the fact that she realli have lots of frens and like she said, she treasure frenship more than anything else..... :(  well .....wat can i say ?? At least she is trying..... Realli wish i can share some of her burdens and all that she is going thru now.   Now i have this habit of loggingonline everynite and check mail,friendster, animesuki to check for latest naruto and initial d, then follow by my own blog then to others blog to check for latest updates.It had realli turn into a habit liow lor. more of like a ritual or routine kind of habit liow. dun know whether its healthy or not leh haha-_-" lame rite?? maybe too free lor...maybe i should start reading up for my module liow starting in aug. well, really muz start liow lah if not wait too late liow then last min lagijia lat. yup jus start reading up wont harm lor.....hmmm....  tok so much then go do it lah ....-_-"  lame !!!
