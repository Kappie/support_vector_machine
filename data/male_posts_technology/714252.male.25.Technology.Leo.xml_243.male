I asked the one person that was sure to know all the lyrics to every cute nursery rhyme in the world (Bubbles) and he was at a loss too (although he did come closest.. See I amn't mad, he does know his nursery rhymes!!) and eventually I searched the web in an attempt to finish my blog.  I finally found the missing lines and clicked on post and publish on my blog, and at the moment my computer goes TEA TIME! TEA TIME! TEA TIME!  For 30 seconds I was both shocked and surprised because at first site it looked like the blog engine had recognised the poem and decided to poke fun at me.. Then I realised that a page with the words for the poem had just finished loading an embeded sound file..  Oh well..
