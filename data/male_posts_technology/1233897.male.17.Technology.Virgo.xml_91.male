It's  urlLink Charlotte Church - All Love Can Be   I will watch you in the darkness Show you love will see you through When the bad dreams wake you crying  I'll show you all love can do All love can do  I will watch through the night  Hold you in my arms Give you dreams where love will be I will watch through the dark 'Til the morning comes All the light I'll take you through the night to see A light showing us all love can be  I will guard you with my bright wings Stay 'til your heart learns to see  All love can be...
