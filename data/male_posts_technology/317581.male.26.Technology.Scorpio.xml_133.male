Anyways...  so I haven't written anything in here for a while, but I don't really have anything to write. I must lead one of the most boring lives of anyone on the planet or something. It's scary sometimes. What can I say though, when you only have 1 day off a week, and you just spend your day resting. Maybe I should just move to Japan for a while or something :)  Oh, and it's nice to see you posting again, Dejah.
