No surprise there, it was a popularity contest with the most popular Survivor ever.  Not that he didn't deserve it.  It's good to see the nice guy win the money, since it seems that in the actual game, someone with Rupert's character can never win, because the back-stabbers and cheaters always rise to the top..that's why i love the game so much.  You can have the best laid plan, but it all comes down the the people you're thrown in with.  If you can't adapt and adjust your gameplan, you're gone.  Survivor, we love you.
