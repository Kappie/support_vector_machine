Hopefully it will be back up later today and normal service will resume :)  In other news, I had the bus ride from hell last night. I don't think a double decker bus is supposed to emulate a rollercoaster, but our driver was certainly having a good try. I'm just glad I had something to hold onto, unlike the poor lady who almost went flying were it not for a well-positioned young man. She apologied profusely for grabbing hold of him, his reply "well I'd rather you grabbed hold of me than the floor"....aw! And they say southerners are cold-hearted people *tuts*
