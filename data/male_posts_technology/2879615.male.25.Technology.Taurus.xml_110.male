My wheezy manager asked me out on a date tonight at work. Umm...who else does this happen to? How many ways can I say "No Brian...you sign my paychecks, and TRUST ME you do NOT want to shit where you eat. 3. So I'm on my way over to the village tonight to play some poker with the newest wheeze in my life and as I turn onto Carnine, I realize I am speeding and there is a cop hot on my tail. So i book to the refuge of Autumn and RUN inside (after I climb over my seat of course since my driver's side door FELL OFF). I thoroughly bug out the Bo Smadge and Uncle Craig as I race inside while they're in the middle of a bleezy saying "Cop followed me here I repeat a cop followed me here". We're all sufficiantly bugged out for a good 5.  Anyway, that is all. I'm off to the wheeze's.  Hearts stars and giggles Sir Smashalot
