Here is an overview of the goals and milestones of the project.  Draft initial game worldmap - complete with 4 continents, will need rework to make continents look more realistic, the draft world map includes rivers, forests, mountains and cities.  Draft religious layout - Setting up the Diety Pantheons, and pecking order. Complete with progression from monotheism to a lost elder pantheon to the current standard Dungeon and Dragon Gods.  Draft Progression of Life on Oerth - Show progression of life forms on earth, which race eldest etc. Complete with standard elder dragon race, with a new twist that I have not seen in other Campaigns.  Draft intial cities and city historys - placement of cities on the world map that are consistent with the logical placement of real world cities. Complete with most popular cities, including trade routes and trade good lists to show supply and demand for each city.   Draft history of government agency - royal lineage of current ruling body, as well as older ruling systems - 25% complete, royal lineage of Everwind complete, other continental lineages will have to be established along with noble families, and previous governing structure.  Draft Key Non-Player Characters in this story - create the NPC story drivers, the main NPC's and their motivations - 50% complete  Draft overall campaign overview explaining what should happen in a "win" scenario - details out what will happen if the players succeed in stopping the evil on Everwind. - complete  Draft overall campaign overview explaining what should happen in a "lose" scenario - details the consequences for failure to stop the evil on Everwind, or to assist in it's taking over. - 0% complete  Draft Campaign goals and setup campaign timeline - setup the milestones that the campaign will try to attain during game play, including key points that reveal the overall plot - complete with fairly detailed key points.  Draft maps for main points of the campaign - draw rough maps of the areas that players will be exploring - 5% complete  Compile drafts into the Game World Development Software - compile all relevante data into the Roleplaying Master Game World Organizer - 1% complete  This is all the requirements of the drafting stage. Many of these steps have been completed in notes and MS Word and have yet to be migrated to the game organizer. After the drafting stage, we will refine all of these items above to create a cohesive and believeable game world. I will not stop on this project until it is an excellent adventure. More detail on the development on this game world will continue later.
