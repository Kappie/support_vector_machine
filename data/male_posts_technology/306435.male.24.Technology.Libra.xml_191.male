We had practce twice a week all through the summer.  With virually the same team every year, my dad had to come up with new ways to make practice fun.  You can only play "chase the ball" so many times.  One of my favorite games was called "Game winning hit".    Game winning hit was very simple.  One person is batting, one person is on deck and the rest of the team is in the field.  We practiced on a universal baseball/softball field consisting of sand infield and a grass outfield.  The batter gets one pitch (from my dad) and in order to be a "game winning hit" it has to land or end up in the grass.  The defense had to start in the dirt.  There goal was to stop the ball from getting to the grass by knocking it down or catching it.  Every game winning hit is one point.  The player with the most points after several rotations wins.The game always had arguments over close calls and of course Trip Williams hitting a moon shot to the playground, but what it did was teach us situational hitting at a young age.  One pitch meant you couldn't be picky.  If it was a strike it then you better hit it and you better hit it hard.    This Sunday I got to put these lessons learned to the test.  It was the end of the second game of a double header in the NKABL.  We had tied the game in the 6th and in the bottom of the 7th I was up with men on 1st and 2nd with 1 out.  Of course the guy on second decides to steal third on the first pitch.  He was safe, but not what I would have done.  Now there is a man on second.  We send the guy on first to keep out of the double play.  I just miss the fastball and now have an 0-2 count.  One pitch left and the infiled comes in close.  I know he won't throw a breaking pitch because his catcher has been sketchy all game.  I am looking fastball outisde and will react on one inside.  Sure enough I get an outside fastball and I drilled it.  It one-hopped the wall in left center field.  Far enough for the outfielders not to turn around, but not as impressive as hitting it into the playground.  I am a cool 5 for 14 (.357).   We won our second game of the season to make us 2-6 on the year.   Not great, but just won win from a franchise record.
