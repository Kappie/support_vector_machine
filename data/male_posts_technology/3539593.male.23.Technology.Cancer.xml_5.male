Only the show lasted four years and was kinda called my College Education - or more hiply - my College Experience.  Like four years of putting up with cynical (but loveable) yuppies wasn't enough, now I either have to become a corporate potato or flee the country to avoid 40k plus in college loans that I *slightly* remember taking.   I think the biggest thing I'm going to miss about old Bowdoin will be the food.  I loved that dining hall.  1st in the nation, damn straight.  That and the bathroom.  I will always be fond of a person that cleans my puke from the sink and smiles at me the next day.  Joyce, you are my personal angel for that.   So that place I was talking about.  You all know it.  Sitting at home.  Wondering how you survived four years of this through highschool.  Feeling like a stranger in the one place you've called home all your life, but which now has the dull name of your Parent's House.  And everyone keeps asking you in hushed tones if you've thought of your future yet, like it's some sort of insider joke - boy you must be asked that a lot.  Well no.  I haven't been asked that nearly enough.  And certainly not enough from the sort of people who would inspire me to actually want to find my calling in life.  You know the type of person I'm talking about; the ones you ask for a cup of sugar and they somehow get you to join the Peace Corps.   I'm ranting now, trying to sound like a real writer whose long-winded tirades somehow worm their way into your heart and make you feel all fuzzy inside.  I hate and love that shit, much like most of that shit out there I guess.  But where does that get me?  Four years of putting the liberal in my liberal arts career (we're talking Women's Studies, Government, Buddhism, Italian, Spanish, Native American spirituality, even a class on Japanimation and Manga!) and out of all of that, I think my greatest classes were in cynicism and lethargy.  Is this really what yuppies do for fun?  Am I doomed to analyze a life that I only half live in moments of lucid daydreaming?  Can I think of some witty or poignent end to this, my first entry, one that will let me go back to obsessively checking my email and wishing someone would come on instant messenger?   Or is this, as the movies asks, as good as it gets?   Well, I doubt it.   But if I'm going to start living that life I've dreamt of, might as well start here at home.  I guess I should dig that Computer Science diploma out of the glove box where I left it graduation day (I still don't understand a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science) and put it to some sort of use.   Even if I couldn't afford the $100 frame for it.
