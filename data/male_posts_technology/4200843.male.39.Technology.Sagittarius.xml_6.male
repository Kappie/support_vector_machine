So my bad luck today, was finding out that I need an operation on my nose to make my nasal passage bigger (have trouble breathing through it). However, the good luck is that it's on the NHS and I've got to wait 6 months.  Saw The Chronicles of Riddick tonight. Top film if SciFi is your thing. Well, was loads better than the Tesco chili con carne I had.      Internet access has been playing up lately. I'm with Telewest Blueyonder. They say all is well, I beg to differ. Anyway a man will be fixing it tomorrow, sometime between 8 am an 11 am, so I have to get up early and it's a Saturday.
