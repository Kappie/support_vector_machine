It's pretty decent going once i get on a roll, but i'm out of my element when it comes to ASP so it's taking longer than it should.   Ah well, i'll get a break from it this evening since i'm heading out to visit the inlaws tonight.  My wife Angel and I gave out tulip bulbs as favours at our wedding last October, and i hear they're blooming this week.  So we're off to Ellershouse, NS to check them out/visit/have some supper.  I'm looking forward to heading down to CB this weekend.  We're stopping in New Glasgow for some Sam's Pizza.  For those of you who've never tried this pizza, it's the best pizza going!  Angel, i know you're reading this, and yes, i admit Sam's Pizza is the best.  I was writing an evaluation this afternoon for a workterm student we have at the office.  He's a pretty decent guy, in grade 12 and a solid knowledge of 3dsmax.  He's been doing good work, so i gave him the dry, boring evaluation form equivalent of the 'thumbs up'.  As of the end of the work day, that's it for me.  I'm out
