For once, I didn't say or do anything completely absurd but I did bring something up to my own attention: I THINK TOO MUCH!!! Okay, show of hands...how many of you were surprised? Two people? Kool, two more than I expected. Anyways to express my point, over the past week, i've expressed some feelings I have about...well mostly our limits. Limits in terms of what we'd do when we get together, restricting what is at liberty to be...um...*ahem* As I was saying, I think too much. The most important detail was left out...we haven't  met  yet! Even though i'm certain it is my destiny to be with her, I sometimes find myself missing signals  far more obvious jabs of interest. This has never happened to me before so i'm not sure what the deal is. Its no secret that she exists on a plane unknownst to most of mankind, conceptualized by the heavens  made reality by the King of kings. And even tho i'm caught in her mystical web of electric pleasure, i've always had/ kept a level head...which makes it all the more odd that sometimes I keep skipping a rail or two on the track. I lose my focus perhaps because i'm so looking forward to the future that I don't see what's right in front of me. Getting closer tho...learning her style more  more and that is essential.  In deployment news, I got some new information today... We're headed for Ft. Benning next week for bout 4-5 days. During this time, we'll be doing our SRP's over again, other logistics work, etc., etc. A slew of representatives from Benning have been here since the beginning and one of them told me they don't even know what our billeting situation will be like next week. I've gone as far as to look up the place where we're supposed to be training at on  urlLink Yahoooo! . Don't have any pictures of the buildings tho...don't know what the living situation wil be like. Either way it adds to the intrugue of the events of the days to come.
