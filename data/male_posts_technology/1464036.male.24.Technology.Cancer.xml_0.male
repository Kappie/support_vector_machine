The new location is next door to the wireless router, therefore giving me the full 54Mb that I need.  It helps when you are uploading 9+ Mb files via ftp.  Fun Fun.  Still trying to get the product complete for the demonstration we have in two weeks.  I know I can make it now.  Christie and I are still debating on an apartment or a house.  I think this will be up in the air for a while.  ILY
