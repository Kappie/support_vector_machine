I would love some help if there's anyone that reads this and would consider doing a group blog with me, let me know and we can start some discussions. No subject will ever be taboo, except of course the issue that was just under discussion. The price you pay for bringing up either my chinese or american heritage as a negative is, I collect your f*ckin head. Just like this f*cker here.  Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, NOW'S THE F*CKIN TIME!!!  ok, what? Oh sorry a little Oren Ishii quote for you, but please, let's discuss, I have a variety of friends, I'm sure we got some discussing to do.  Let me know- Tim
