He certainly isn't a substitute for a lover, but in the end he probably gets on my my nerves at about the same rate as any guy I have ever known.   Babalu is now 8, and last September he was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardio myopathy...in other words he has a heart condition. The chamber walls of his heart are thickening and eventually it just won't be able to pump the blood through his system. It kinda sucks cause he seriously is a great companion cat. He's always at the door waiting for me when I get home, I have no idea how he can distinguish my footsteps coming up the stairs as opposed to someone else's but I think he can. He also races to the end table that's seated directly by the front door when I leave, one last opportunity for me to give him a little face and neck rub. Hey if it makes him happy, then it makes me happy.   I've had him since he was a youngin'; he was born on April 15th, 1996 and I brought him home on the Friday beforeMemorial Day of the same year. He was born into the family of a co-workers' friend and he was brought to me that Friday at work. He was, without a doubt, the cutest kitten I had ever seen and from the moment we "met" we seemed to bond. He was such a tiny little thing and climbed up my arm as though we were old friends. I also remember all my co-workers making such a fuss over him, wanting to pet him and cooing and fussing over him; Senior Management obviously didn't appreciate it but since we were getting out early anyway, they basically looked the other way. Have to say it was there loss for looking the other way for one look into his eyes and you couldn't help but melt.   I remember when I brought him home, all textbooks will say that a cat or kitten entering a new home will walk the perimeter of the room while they are getting used to their surroundings....not Babalu, he just walked out of the carrierand settled in immediately. He was so self confidant and cool and fun when he was younger but I guess living in my home which for months at a time would haveno visitors has made him more than slightly wary whenever he hears someone approaching the front door. Most times now he will either run like hell into the bedroom, leaving behind him a vapor trail a la an old Warner Brothers cartoon or he will run to the hallway entrance, pausing and looking back just long enough so he can confirm in his little cat mind that whoever is at the door is not someone he wants to socialize with. If the visitor is a temporary visitor (read: hookup) he will essentially stay out of sight for the entire visit. If however the visitor is a friend(s) or a dateand we settle into some leisure time, like watching a movie or having dinner he will typically make an entrance within an hour. Just to say hello, then he will retire back to the bedroom and wait till the coast is clear. I guess I blame myself for his skittishness as fortoo many years Iwould get stoned around him. I guess marijuana can and does kill brain cells, I just didn't think the brain cells would be his; but perhaps I am over reacting on this point.   He doesn't ask for much really, fresh water, some dry food, canned food on a regular schedule (within reason) and of course a litter box that is taken care of on a regular basis and of course attention. Boy does he require attention...it is impossible for me to sit a the computer for any length of time without him jumping up on the desk and standing directly in front of the monitor - which, let me tell you, can get not only old but pretty damn annoying. But on the whole, I wouldn't have it any other way - the benefits of sharing an apartment with him far outway the negatives.   Babalu is a cool cat and while I know he won't be around for ever, I hope while he's with me he is as happy andcontent with me asI have been with him.   Thank you Babalu for 8 great years, lets hope you can make it another 8.  :)
