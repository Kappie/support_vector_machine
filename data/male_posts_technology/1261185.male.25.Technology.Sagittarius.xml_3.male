We had our weekly meeting this morning and so I had to be here at 7:30 this morning and try like hell to stay the fuck awake long enough to look interested about the same old shit again, retold for the newbies.  Courtney went to the doctor yesterday and she does not have gestation's diabetes, thank goodness!!  That was a huge load off my mind for sure!    So I am leaving for Vegas next Wednesday and I am trying to get my shit in order before I go.  Also we are going to the shitty Texas beach this weekend with Courtney's family and her step-son Stephen.  We should have fun, regardless of the seaweed and possible sludge that will be present.  More later.
