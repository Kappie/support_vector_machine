It might be easy to dismiss her rants as the culmination of intellectual dwarfism meets menopause. Unfortunately, to the more easily fooled reactionary lemmings, she is a demi-goddess, and her bile filled diatribes are gospel. And this is what makes her dangerous.  How anyone can take Ann Coulter seriously is probably more a question for the psychiatric community than for sociologists. But the fact that a small extremely radical faction does take her seriously is not the most troubling thing. More troubling is that she is given the venue to spill her venomous dung. Simple common decency by channels such as FOX should determine that her brand of radical, racist, hate filled, factually inaccurate commentary never be given life in a mainstream format. But no one has ever accused the the FOX Neo-Con Channel of common decency, nor factual reporting for that matter.  Ann has spewed forth racial hate on a daily basis for the better part of her public life. A small sampling of her most hateful portrayal of non-white races include:  "To get into university without achievement or grades, you wanna have a name like Shafiqua, Jeffrika or Leroy," says Ann, who is not a fan of racial quotas.  "We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity."  No one has ever questioned Ann's blatant racism, certainly not the corporate media she works for, or the small but extremely radical portion of the population to whom she preaches. Many others have lost their jobs in the media for much less. Jimmy The Greek Snyder, a regular on the NFL Today on CBS during the 70's and 80's, was run off the air for a drunken comment he made in a restaurant, where only a handful of people could have heard it, and to Jimmy's credit, while the remark hinted of racism, at least part of it was factually accurate. Ann makes no attempt at factual accuracy.  When it comes to factual accuracy and what most non-psychopaths normally refer to as reality, Ann makes no attempt to approach either. In one recent example from Ann, we get the following pathological lie ,  So far, we have found chemical and biological weapons  brucella and Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever, ricin, sarin, aflatoxin  and long-range missiles in Iraq. -May 26, 2004.  Do I even need to comment? Did any of the rest of us miss the fact that every member of the administration has not even mentioned WMD as the reason for going into Iraq in over a year, lest they relive the obvious embarrassment of their criminal actions? But in Ann's world, ahh, all is bliss as long as she can continue to manufacture untruths to justify killing anyone that is not white.  Ann's blatant hatred extends to anyone whom does not share her extreme radical ideology. And Ann's ideology is hate. In it's purest form. Ann will bully, twist, and lie to get her point across, and it does not matter how far from reality her point is. And in those rare moments when she can not quickly come up with some distorted facts to make her point, she resorts to the childish art of name calling. I think the obvious point to be made here is that it is not worth even engaging someone in debate if the best that particular opponent can offer in exchange is name calling. But then again, Ann is not actually inviting anyone her to debate her. A lawyer by training, she knows that if she can just plant her lies with the jury often enough, the lie soon becomes perceived as fact. Most in the political arena have mastered this art to one degree or another. Ann takes it to it's pathological extreme.  Ann has become a darling of the corporate media. She has free reign to spill her bile onto the unsuspecting public. She is undoubtedly the most divisive personality to be involved in political commentary in this country. And someone so divisive is actually what the corporate media needs as they march forward with their agenda to subvert democracy. Divide and conquer. The more divided the American people, the better it is for the corporate media, and ultimately, those pulling the strings of the corporate media. It doesn't matter if you love Ann or loathe Ann. As long as Ann divides, she serves her purpose.
