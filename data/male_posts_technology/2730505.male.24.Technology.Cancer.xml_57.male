Went home watched some TV and went to bed early, I mean early; like 10:30 - 11 pm or something ridiculous like that.  I guess it's for the better since I had to be at work early today so I can leave early to go on my date with the FBI.  Eh, that should be interesting.  This should be it in terms of naturalization.  I can now get an American passport and go wherever the fuck I want.  No more Visas to deal with no more going to various embassies etc.  Just go to the airport and fly out.  Now that I am looking forward to.  I remember the last time that me and my family had to take a trip out of the country, we went all over western Europe and we had to go get this Shengen Visa so that we could travel all over the place.  It was such a hassle but those days are over.  Hell Yeah.  In other news.  I told my parents that I plan on moving out at the end of the month and they really didn't give a shit.  Yeah, it's great.  Maybe they just need some time to digest what I said but overall, last night when I told them there was no response be it yay or nay.  Strange, I thought they would be at least somewhat leaning towards the yay but there really was no clear cut reaction to what I said.  Maybe today I will get an email from the matriarch telling me that I shouldn't do it or that I should I don't know.  Whatever I guess.  So today just slowed down to the pace of a snail trying to climb up the side of a fish tank.  Yeah that slow.  I got here and things were already in the swing of things but then, screeeeecchhhh... Everything came to a halt.  I don't know what it is.  I also feel the need to light one up.  I try to keep myself busy but shit, this is hard.  I am at the bumming phase and it makes me feel "sub-human" (you like that crab cake?) to bum from people all the time.  Maybe pride will win out, let's hope so, I think so.  After that I see myself battling the gaining weight problem that comes with quitting smoking.  At least it's getting warm out so I can do something about it.  Jerry is getting ready for me to move in.  Clearing shit from my tiny ass room.  Good thing I don't need a lot of shit.  I just need my futon, TV, TV stand, computer speakers, laptop, computer table, dresser and closet (with my clothes).  Little things I will just slowly get from the parents house.  Jerry also bought NBA Live 2004 and another controller.  There are three controllers for my XBOX now.  3.  That should include some nice HALO multiplayer as well as sports multiplayer action....and future games, oooo....Splinter Cell : Pandora Tomorrow or something like that.  That's going to be just badass to play.  Play as a spy and your perspective is 3rd person with good stealth and limited weapons.  Play as the mercs and you get 1st person perspective with a lot of weapons.  That's an interesting twist to something old.  Curious to see how that one plays.  Yeah interesting day so far this is.....
