Dave Kearns mentions  urlLink here  about the 3rd identity federation specfication called  urlLink Shibboleth from the Internet2 community .  But this is a mess....one more thing I found disturbing is the existence of  urlLink WS-I . If WS-* standards are made by such a vast tech-community there should not be another standard to address interoperability...as far as I am concerned this defies the whole purpose of having standards.   urlLink
