That's right... out of the 1,688 messages I have received over the last three weeks, 1,503 are of absolutely no use to me. That's astounding.  The main reason I am writing with awe and amazement, and not frustration, is that I have a very effective spam filter.  urlLink POPFile  absolutely rocks. POPFile is able to detect spam before I see it, and move it to a separate folder. It is 98.99% effective in doing this, which is amazing.   I could set POPFile up to delete the spam automatically, but I am still interested in seeing the spam before it's deleted. That's because (every once and a while) POPFile mistakenly classifies a good email as spam. I still care about finding the 0.2% of all messages this happens to, even though 99.8% makes it through.  Outlook 2003 has a built-in spam filter as well, but I haven't had a chance to try it.   The best solution for stopping spam in its tracks is to change your email address. I own a number of domains, so switching would be fairly easy for me to do technically. But there are so many reasons why it would be hard to do logistically that it's impractical.   A year ago, I was in favor of changing the SMTP specification so that it would be nearly impossible to send anonymous emails. If you get rid of anonymous emails, you get rid of spam. But now, with spam filters in place, I am content to leave things the way they are. The only problem becomes, I suppose, the financial cost of spam is still not covered by the spammers. That's a problem for the ISPs to deal with though.
