The deal expands on an earlier partnership between San Francisco-based BrightMail and Microsoft's MSN, which has deployed BrightMail filters on its Internet access service."

 This is great news for Hotmail users. I have pretty much filtered out the majority of junk mails sent to me via the "custom filters" and "inbox protector tool" built into Hotmail. I get maybe, at the most five spam e-mails a day, and I have signed up for a lot of newsletters over the years. For the most part I am pretty happy with amount of spam I get now. I just hope it doesn't get worse.
