Some are just in for the good stuff and can't be bothered, you know who you are!!!  Anyway, I am still acumilating all the evidence from the TF/General Hospital Summer Ball, but here are a few of the photos I have found so far...              So there you all go, there are hopefully a load to come, but for now tata.  Baity signing off.....  'Into Glory Ride'  P.S. If anyone is interested, there are more pictures from the night in the photo section of the site.
