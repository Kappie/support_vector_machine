Of L lying to me and hurting me over and over again.  In my dreams I'm dying all the time As I wake its kaleidoscopic mind I never meant to hurt you I never meant to lie So this is goodbye This is goodbye  Tell the truth you never wanted me Tell me  In my dreams I'm jealous all the time As I wake I'm going out of my mind Going out of my mind
