Well let us see... due to stupid wars in IRAQ the oil industry has something to bitch and complain about, and who ends up paying more at the pump, you do... Today I heard that Oklahoma is taking to the senate a bill that would raise our gas tax more...(are you friggen kiddin me?), and on top of that Oklahoma is footin and approving to tax 50 cents more per pack of smokes.   Lay off the TAXES, and give us a break... while you drive your nice LEXUS and Caddy's. My salute to you Mr Bush, I'd tank ya in the swamp before i'd cast another vote.
