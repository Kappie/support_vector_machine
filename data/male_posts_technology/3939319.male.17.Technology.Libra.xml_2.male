"the mailbox spiders"... actually it's kinda dorky, but kinda cool if you're weird like me... anybody else have tons of spiders and spiderwebs all over your freaking mailbox? it's upsetting... anywho, i'm signin off and i'll comment on other ppl's blogs later on sometime... i'm kind of in a gaming mood right now, so that's where i'm heading.... commence comments.
