This was our first trip to the Sierras and with me being allergic to the outdoors in general, I wasn't quite expecting to enjoy it as much as I did.   Took a couple of hundred pictures, at least. At least fifty were of Yosemite Falls alone, since it seemed to follow us all through our treks and raft-rides. Bad Yosemite Falls!  Hiked to Vernal Falls on Sunday morning; turns out sneakers don't make very good footwear when travelling downhill. Bad sneakers!  Tried rafting on an exceptionally calm and shallow Merced River (stream?). Raft hit the river bottom a couple of times, and Chris, being the only one with removable footwear, had to play tow-truck. Bad Merced River!   And, ah yes ! We had to hike back all the way to the raft rental place as those bastards wouldn't send out enough shuttle buses to ferry us back to the starting point. Chris had to walk barefoot, and developed some pretty blisters on his feet. Bad rafting company !  At the end of it all, we got smashed at bar in the Miner's Lodge where we were staying, and sang silly songs that should never ever be performed on stage. We were planning to make a quick stop at Glacier Point the next morning, but were too groggy to do so the next day. Bad hangover !  Ah well. Gives me an excuse to go back again. All in all, a good trip !
