The male brain rejuvenates differently than the female brain does, Gurian says. 'Using brain scans, University of Pennsylvania neuroscientist Ruben Gur found that the male brain goes to a rest state to rejuvenate much more than the female brain does. To build brain cells and restore himself, a man needs to 'zone out,'' Gurian says. That's why he channel-surfs or stares at the computer.  But the female brain, thanks to all that oxytocin, wants to bond at the end of the day in order to rejuvenate. 'She wants to talk, using all those verbal centers, and she wants to get close to him,' Gurian says. But the timing's all off. 'If the wife takes a break and vents first to someone else -- a friend on the phone, perhaps -- and lets her husband rejuvenate during that zone-out period, he'll be much more prepared to listen later on, during dinner, for example. It's all about timing.' "
