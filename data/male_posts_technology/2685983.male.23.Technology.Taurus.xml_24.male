(I swear it seems like I do gayer and gayer things every day)  I bought this book last night. I enjoyed it even more than Ghost World or 20th Century Eightball. I liked it so much that I just ordered the other 4 Clowes graphic novels from  urlLink amazon.ca . I can really relate to Clowes and the elements of truth in his characters. The misunderstood frustrated misanthropes whose only glimmers of hope get shattered - that's me.  Damn. I guess you're probably getting the impression that I've been having a string of bad days but actually I'm feeling inspired and I want to do some writing and recording today. I have to take Blue Crush back today and I haven't watched it yet (I want to watch it for the ocean cinematography, dammit, I swear - I don't care if it's cheesy). Also we rented the last four episodes of 24 season one. My room, and my whole house, needs serious cleaning. I'm sure these things will get in the way of me doing anything creative today.
