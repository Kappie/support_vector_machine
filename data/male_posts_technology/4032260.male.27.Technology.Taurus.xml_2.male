(Philippians 1:27-28)  This seems to expand on the whole  love smartly  idea. If we are loving smartly then our lives will show these results, namely unity in the faith. Paul goes on in the beginning of chapter 2 encouraging them to "be like minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of the same mind." "Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself. Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interest of others."
