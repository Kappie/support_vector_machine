As part of the deal, Microsoft also stripped out some unspecified features from both products and slashed the price for the pair to 1,500 Thai Baht, or about $38 U.S. Microsoft Windows XP Home sells at retail for $225; Office XP Standard retails for $499.   It seems odd that Microsoft can offer a product like this in one location, and yet fight so hard in other locations (like the US  EU) that Windows is inseperable, and that the components cannot be stripped out.
