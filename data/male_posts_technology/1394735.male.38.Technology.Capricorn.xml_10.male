And it even knows how to store excess fuel in a manner that keeps it ready almost indefinitely. The waste produced by the human body, while not exactly pleasant, is certainly not noxious to the environment and is, in fact, fairly easily recycled into new sources of fuel. And yet, for all this, we still focus our technical efforts on artificial means of locomotion and scarce, exotic fuel sources. Advances in material sciences and engineering should be able to give us tools to enable the human engine to go farther, faster, higher than ever before. Yet it seems that the best we can do is create hundred dollar running shoes which still do little if anything to increase speed and distance and still wear out after 500 miles of use. Or, if you prefer, the best advances in bicycling technology (one of the most efficient means of propulsion to utilize the human engine) are so expensive and specialized that only the most elite riders of the Tour de France can take advantage of them. One of my own favorite sports, swimming, has only just begun to scratch the surface in hydrodynamic attire. Until recently the thinking was that the closer you were to fully naked, the faster you would swim. The purists will roll over in their graves, but I'd like to see a swimming event which was the equivalent of bicycling. Use anything you like, fins, flippers, paddles, hydrodynamic suits, as long as the human engine remains the sole source of power for propulsion. Could you imagine the swimming equivalent of the Tour de France? It might be the Tour of the South Pacific, with competitors swimming in stages from one island to the next. Leaving sports behind for a moment, let's consider another of man's most basic needs for propulsion: the commute. The number of people who don't rely on motors and fossil fuels to get them to work is so small that it doesn't even bear mentioning. But let's visit some of the pitfalls of such unorthodox modes of travel. I walk to work. I live about a mile and a half from my office in downtown Minneapolis. My commute takes around 25 minutes from door to desk. On very hot and humid days I may arrive with a trickle of sweat running down my back or on my forehead. So what. It isn't enough to make me smell up the office and its usually gone within 30 minutes in my climate-controlled building. On very cold days I arrive ready to wrap my hands around a hot cup of oatmeal (fuel for the commute home). If I lived farther away and wanted to still arrive in 25 minutes or less, I would have to run or ride a bike (or skateboard or wear roller blades, etc.). This would increase my chances of arriving in an unacceptably sweaty mess, unready for work until I showered and changed clothing (adding to the commute time). Engineers please take note. Here is a problem which you should be able to solve. Can you make a self-propelled vehicle which will require the same exertion as walking, but travel twice as fast? Or, if you like, create a fabric that disposes of the sweat in an in-offensive way. Of course you could, if you weren't so busy trying to build a better bomber for the Air Force, or create the perfect niche for a cupholder in that mini-van. Of course, you say, nobody would buy such things. I would. And others will to if you make them so that they can be sold at a profit. Trust that there are marketers out there every bit as good at what they do as you are at what you do. (Marketers, I'll spare you my ire today, but be consider notice has been served.) Sure, this is a rant. But it's a rant with purpose. You always hear people challenging you to think outside the box. Here's a little explored area way outside the box. Not even the Wright brothers believed that the airplane would be commercially viable. Think of the benefits to the environment, to public health, to the economy. Have some faith in what a body can do.
