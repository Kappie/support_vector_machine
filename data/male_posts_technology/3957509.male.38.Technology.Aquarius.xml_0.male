Fell asleep...I'm at the hospital...can you come?" "I'm on my way."  Just last week I had dinner with Chris and his partner, Drew. They have been together for 8 years. Yet, as of last night, Drew is no longer here - he fell asleep at the wheel, crashed into the highway divider, and was killed instantly. Only a mile from home! Hasn't it been said that many of these "falling asleep" accidents occur within three miles of one's home?  So, today is a day of memories, tears, anger, consolation, and sorrow.  Please keep Chris in your thoughts and prayers.  Peace!   Drew M 1968 - 2004 Requiescat in Pace
