My parents arrived as well. After some slight difficulty, they did manage to get themselves 1 street away from me. I walked down to meet them and direct them the right way (which was like 500m away only).  The evening they hung around and they got me really pekchek. 1 of my housemates reminded me to be more patient (obviously they could tell I was starting to rise my voice and all that). Told myself I'd try to contain whatever impatient feelings I've got but it's tremendously hard with my mom. The dun-listen-but-wanna-talk-more-and-harping-on-same-topic-but-can't-get-main-point-across chitter chatter juz gets me everytime. My dad's at least is more objective about stuff.  I have a feeling it's going to be a long 2 wks. Watever lah, at least I do have the convocation tomorrow to keep me busy for the next 24 hrs.
