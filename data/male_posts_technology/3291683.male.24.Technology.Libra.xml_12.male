The garage now actually has its first coat of real paint on it (and primer, too!).  Sadly, the Garage isn't finished, by any stretch; we've only done the side, and we have to do over the door on the front, also.  I wish we could just tear it down and start from scratch, but that would involve money we don't have.  For that matter, there's a LOT of things we want to do: replace pretty much every window in the house with nice vinyl windows, finishing off a room in the basement to be a darkroom for my wife, getting me a nice workbench/area in the basement, re-siding the house, getting rid of the huuuge tree in our back yard that my neighbor hates (we haven't lived there long enough to hate it yet) and I'm afraid is going to fall on our house, pave the driveway, replace the garage entirely, replace the front and back doors, re-carpet the living room...  I know, it's practically a never-ending list, but hey.  That's how houses go, I suppose; a never-ending source of projects and time-sinks.  I have to admit, at least, that I'm quite impressed with how cool our house typically stays.  It's obviously not the worst of the summer yet, but I have high hopes I'll survive without melting into a pool of sludge.  Soooooo, who here is familiar with  Popcap Games ?  They're a great company that does some very amusing stuff.  My favorite game, at the moment, is  Rocket Mania .  Simple concept, good gameplay, and I find it a lot of fun.  I just wish I could afford to waste the $25 on a registered version right now.  I strongly recommend you guys take a shot at it and see how you do; who knows, you might even enjoy it.  The other game I think is definitely worth checking out is Bookworm.  It's actually good even as an educational program.  Give it a shot; you just might like it.  The weather up in this corner of the country is...  Exciting, I'd say, right now.  We're in the middle of a whole bunch of massive storms, which are apparently spawning Tornados.  It sounds like fun, doesn't it?  I just hope my cats are okay.  At least one of them is pretty afraid of thunder.  Yes, that'd be the one who woke me up at 3:00 AM because she really wanted to be under the covers, and I was apparently in the way.  She left a half hour later, of course, because...  Ummm, well, I really don't know why.  She's like that, I suppose.  I have three cats, for those that haven't caught on.  The oldest is Lady Meowsalot (my wife named this one), Defender of the Western Litterbox, who once meowed loudly outside the kitchen door, who bravely assaulted my wife's hair while my wife was getting ready for work, and who napped repeatedly in treacherous and high places where only the bravest cats go.  Or something like that.  Commonly known as "Lady".  She's a very small gray-and-white, just a little over a year old.  Short-furred, very beautiful; she's the climber in the family.  We often come home to find her on the wall at the end of the bath tub in our downstairs bathroom, or on top of the highest cupboard in the kitchen.  She also has a stuffed bear from our honeymoon in Alaska that she just loves.  The bear is on our bed, and every night after we're in bed, she'll come up on the bed, knead the bear for a few minutes, and then demand to be let under the covers so she can hang out.  She never stays there all night, but it's very important to her that she be under there for a few minutes.  Lady is actually very thin.  Personally, I think it's because of her mother.  Lady was born after the mother had been rescued, but during pregnancy the mommy cat was a stray, and badly undernourished; she almost didn't survive for the kittens to be born.  I'm thinking she didn't develop quite right because of it.  When we first got her, she had this funny half-meow, where she'd open her mouth and look like she was trying to meow, but most of it was silent except for a little squeak at the end.  We never did figure that one out, and she grew out of it.  When we got her, it was entirely my wife's fault.  She had gotten into the habit (back when we didn't work in the same company, let alone the same building) of stopping at the pet store once or twice a week and visiting the cats up for adoption.  One day, this little gray-and-white kitten curled up on her should, and she was doomed.  She filled out an application, saying "I have to get this okayed by my husband"...  And she swore up and down she wasn't attached to this cat...  But that was just a terrible un-truth, and so we got the cat.  :)  It was exciting, because we technically weren't allowed to have cats in the apartment...  In fact, we had all three cats before we left there; but no we're in our own house, and WE make the rules.  :)  The next-oldest cat is Poe Bloggs, commonly known as "Poey".  I named after "Joe Bloggs".  Look it up if you don't recognize the name.  :)  He's a funny little black-and-white cat; a black back and head, but a white mask (the black JUST BARELY touches his right eye, but the rest of his face and muzzle is white).  Kinda spotted.  I really WANTED to name him "Lurtz", because his face really does look like the evil guy from LoTR, but my wife didn't let me get away with it.  About 9 months old, maybe 11?  Also, he's not particularly bright.  His idea of getting attention is head-butting you until you give in to his demands.  Reading?  Head-butt the book until you drop it, then head-butt you until you pet him.  Sleeping?  Climb onto your chest and head-butt your head until you wake up and pay attention.  On the computer?  Jump into your lap and head-butt you.  He also enjoys chasing the mouse pointer around the computer screen (I've never been particularly fond of that habit), because OBVIOUSLY it's an EEEEEVIL mouse pointer.  Yup.  And he's got to save us from it!  He's definitely my favorite of the three, though he's much more "our cat" now than he used to be.  His sense of balance, though it has improved greatly, is still not the best; he commonly jumps up on something, lays down, and promptly falls off.  Nowhere near as agile as Lady.  He eats a lot, and is a little overweight.  He doesn't meow; but he does chirp (he sounds more like my guinea pigs than like the other cats!), and his purr is hilarious.  It's this manic half-the-time purr, like he can only purr while breathing out and not while breathing in, or something.  I've never heard another cat quite like him.  The third cat is  Elendil , named by me, and about 6-7 months old; he's commonly known as "Ellie", and people yell at me for naming him a feminine name.  My wife wasn't thrilled with the name, but couldn't come up with a better one, and eventually caved.  Lady was entirely my wife's fault, and Poey was kinda a mutual desire for Lady not to be lonely during the day while we were both out, but I'll admit Ellie was pretty much my fault.  I've always had a love for black cats, and Ellie is a black with a little white star on his chest and tiny white traces on his legs.  We were buying cat supplies (natch) at the pet store, and this kitten just broke my heart...  So he came home with us.  Of course, he's a little wimp, and spent the better part of a week hiding under the couch, but he's gotten over it (mostly) now.  He's entirely unafraid of the other cats (he's actually the biggest, though I think Poe still weighs slightly more), and plays quite rough; him and Lady only grudgingly get along.  Elendil and Poe, though, get along great; we have pictures somewhere of them sleeping together.  My favorite time (I don't think we have a picture of this one) was them laying facing opposite directions on the couch, with Poe's paw under Ellie's head and Poe's head over Ellie's neck.  Very, very cute.  :)  He's gotten a lot more cuddly recently with us people, too, which is good, since the cats are nice enough to let us live there.  Very timid cat.  He LOOKS overweight, with a lot of loose skin, but he isn't as heavy as Poe, and he doesn't act overweight.  It's kinda odd.  This cat is the most vocal, by far.  If he decides he's alone, he'll get upset and start chirping or meowing.  In fact, even if he's just downstairs in my wife's office and we're upstairs in the bedroom, he'll cry until someone goes down to get him, even though he prefers to follow us up himself than be carried.  Of course, it doesn't have to be US that goes to get him; it can be a cat, too.  Wow, I rambled on about the cats more than I meant to.  But since I've already wasted so much page space on three of the pets, I may as well go on and talk about the other three.  Besides our cats, we have two guinea pigs and a rabbit.  The Rabbit's name is Thumper, and my wife got him a while back in college.  He REALLY hates men.  I mean, not dislikes and avoids, but HATES.  He's bitten me more times in two years than he has my wife in five.  He's cute enough, but he chews anything he can get his teeth on...  As long as its mine.  He's destroyed several pairs of pants, several shoelaces, one pair of shoes, a backpack, and a laptop power cord, that I know of.  I'm really not very fond of him.  It's not just me, though; it's other men, too.  Just that I'm the one around the most.  The Guinea Pigs are mine.  The first was actually a Valentine's day present last year from my wife; I named her Samantha.  We went and got another to keep Samantha company, and this one I named Harriet.  Harriet, unfortunately, died young; she fell and broke her neck.  I was very, very upset over that.  :-(  A couple of weeks later (Harriet had a cold, and it went back and forth between the two Guinea Pigs for two months), we got a new one, and named her Guenevere.  They live in their cage next to Thumper's, though their life isn't particularly exciting.  They make lots of noise while we're in the kitchen.  :)  Hmmmm, and on that note, I need to get them some lettuce.  Anyway.  This post has turned very log, and with very little of interest...  So I think I'll cut it off.  Have a good day, y'all.
