I find that I, unfortunately, hardly spend any time at all just being with them.  I would love to more, but with the rigors of a full time job, two young children at home, and all of that, I don't really get too much time.  It does happen every once in a while, but it has to be intentional and it has to be scheduled in advance.  It's kind of too bad it has to be so structured, I love to just drive and pop in for visits... But it's important to realize that I'm not just making plans for myself, I've got 3 other people in the house to consider.  Sometimes, I'll have kids drop by the house around the girlies bedtime, which is always fun for everyone.  It's a big treat for them when someone comes over and reads a story or prays with them before bed. In lieu of hang time, I find that IM can create a presence to connect with students.  We used to use AIM quite a bit at work, now we have a corporate messaging platform.  And since most of my job is leading, delegating, empowering my team, it's mostly done from a desk, either writing email, chatting over IM or talking on a conference call.  IM is just so practical.   So I find that around 2-2.30, the buddy list just lights up.  Of course, I don't have any milk and cookies when they get home from school, but I think some of the kids I have connected with know that I'm mostly around and can chat if they feel like it.  I also don't try to overburden kids, like talking to them every time they come on.  That would be a little weird.  But of course, I make an effort and I think they do too.  It's neat.  Someone asked me once if I thought it was just a medium for gossip.  I don't really think so, anymore than the phone is.  They also mentioned that a kid that just moved here didn't really connect because they kept chatting with their old friends from where they moved from.  I could see that.  In fact, I told my graduating kids that that when they get to college, they should not log on for the first 2 weeks.  The beginning of college should be about roaming from dorm to dorm, meeting people, not sitting at a computer. Also, I use a thing called GAIM, which lets you run msn, yahoo and aim from the same window manager.  It's very cool.  The other thing that I love about it is that it automatically logs every conversation.  Not because I am a weirdo.  But I think it's fun to go back and read those significant conversations sometimes. Anyway, I thought I would share some of the different things that I have chatted with kids about, things that I think are pretty significant:  missions (of course) the will of God dating careers, the future, etc. planning a surprise party starting with a new campus ministry or not working on a resume checking grammar on a paper dealing with addiction helping a friend with is suicidal good versus bad worship family issues   So all in all, I'm a big fam of IM.  Some of the students think that all I do is chat with people all day long.  In reality, I do a lot of chatting with people all day long.  It's just that most of it is work, some of it isn't.  After all, I AM an extrovert...
