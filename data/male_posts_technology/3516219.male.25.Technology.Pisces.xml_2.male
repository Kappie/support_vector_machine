The weblog has become an open exchange between thinkers en followers alike. So from now on, i wil post my views on the world via this website. You will be able to comment on things written by me, however i itend to favor discussion above ranting and raving. Wich means that i will delete comments containing any expression of racism, name-calling and other things wich upset me or the general public. So sit back and enjoy the ride.
