LEARN TO SHARE, MOTHERFUCKERS!!! AAHAHAHAHA!! Anyways, I got four extra songs for me: Orgy, Fiction (Dreams in Digital) Beastie Boys, Ch-Check It Out The Chemical Brothers, Leave Home Juno Reactor, Nitrogen Part 2  So, one Rock, one Rap, and two Techno. Woot!  Napster is pretty nice, it beats having to pay a lot for a friggin' CD when you only want one or two of the tracks, and the downloads are uber-fast, like 383.4 Kbps!!  I reccomend.
