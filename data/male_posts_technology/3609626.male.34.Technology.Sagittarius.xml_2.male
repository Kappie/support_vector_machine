To be more objective, here is what I like about it.  Remember, this is a web based interface written in VERY simple languages.  It uses the same technology as yahoo or hotmail (or amazon for that matter), but it does some very creative and new things.    First is simply how mail is organized: threads vs. folders.  So instead of making folders and sorting mail into them, the email are pulled into threads - so all email sent and received around a title are stacked together by date.  Very slick.  Second is keyboard shortcuts.  Yes, keyboard shortcuts in a web app.  Too cool.  So... If you use web-based mail and I send you an invite, try it out.
