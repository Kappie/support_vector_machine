If McGreevy wants to have gay sex in his off-time, then I don't think it's anybody else's concern except his wife's.  He spoke up promptly and that, at least, is to be respected.  It's more than Clinton did, arguing over the definition of "is".  He's also probably doing the right thing keeping quiet what with the extortion charges still pending and all.  Why are the Republicans making such a big deal about when he'll actually step down?  Do they really think that a special election will yield a Republican governor when McGreevy's polls have gone UP since the scandal broke?  More moralistic posturing from the Right, in my opinion.  If he's stepping down just because he's gay, or because he got nailed for an extramarital affair, then shame on him.  If you love the cock, just say so, McGreevy, get on with it, and shut the hell up.  What makes me laugh is that Cipel is saying he's not gay.  Could have fooled me!
