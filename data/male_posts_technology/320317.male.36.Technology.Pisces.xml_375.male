 It's nice to know I am not the only one out there who feels this way. Although, I feel the term  minimalist  is incorrect. Almost sounds like there is no design at all. I have always liked the term  clean . I think it's much harder to design a clean site that users understand, than a site with too much "design" and graphics, that looks like an acid trip.
