The firemen yell to the brunette: "Jump! Jump! It's your only chance to survive!" The brunette jumps and SWISH! - the firemen yank the blanket away, with predictable consequences. "C'mon! Jump! You gotta jump!" shout the firemen to the redhead. "Oh no! You're gonna pull the blanket away!" replies the redhead. "No! It's brunettes we can't handle. We're OK with redheads!" So she jumps, and SWISH! - the firemen yank the blanket away, and the lady is flattened on the pavement. Finally, the blonde steps to the edge of the roof. Again, the firemen  yell "Jump! You have to jump!" "No way!  you're just gonna pull the blanket away!" yelled the blonde. "No really," call the firemen, "You have to jump! We won't pull the blanket away again." "Look," the Blonde says, "I'm no fool. I don't trust you.  So what I want you to do is put the blanket down, and back away from it..."
