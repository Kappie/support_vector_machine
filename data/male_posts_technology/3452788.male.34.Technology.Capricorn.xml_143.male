This is one of those days, where I sense the feeling that there are important or necessary things for me to do, and fun/enriching things for me to do.  I'm doing none of those, and am instead trying with little or no success to appear busy at work.  As stated before, I am no longer of the opinion that working somewhere else will solve my career angst.  I need an entirely new career, possibly involving entirely different sets of knowledge and skills.  But first, I need to work on myself, becoming whole and powerful.  Too bad I cannot possibly afford to quit working and go back to college for something new.  Choices made, mortgages signed, vows spoken, promises to be kept, lives entrusted, paths already taken.  I always thought that people were never really stuck.  I still believe that, but I now also realize that we sometimes allow ourselves to be held in place, stuck with molasses instead of super glue.  Sometimes the getting unstuck is more difficult that the tedium of marking time.  The rewards of pulling free are hard to see and harder to appreciate when everything around you is urging you to go with the current, don't resist, don't look around, just keep moving along.   People who do great things find the strength to resist the current, while those who are less strong live on in obscurity and grey tedium until they pass the baton for good, hoping their children will have a better life and do great things.  Is that how you know you have given up on life, when you start wishing great accomplishments for your kids, and neglect to care about your own dreams?   I had strength, once.  I resisted the current, for a few memorable moments.  Now I've forgotten how, and the Beast won't let me remember what it felt like.  I want that feeling back, I want to feel like I make a difference to the world, I want to be proud of something I did.  How, I don't know just yet.  It is a work just begun, with very little progress to show yet, but give me a little time.
