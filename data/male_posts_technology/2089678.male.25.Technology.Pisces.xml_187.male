Maintaining an interesting public blog is certainly a good idea and a nice way to get recognized. But for many, that is not a sufficient reason to spend the hard earned money on a domain name, blogging service and hosting fees apart from the valuable time spent.  A traditional and good way to get monetary rewards is to display (RELEVANT) ads in your blog without sacrificing the user experience and the overall design.  But how to find advertisers and how much would they pay? Many Advertisers are searching for (right) blogs and websites to publish their ad and ready to pay based on the reputation of the site and the number of clicks they receive. But its tedious to keep track the number of links that are outgoing and maintaining an account and providing the necessary reports to the advertiser.  A common and probably the best workaround for this problem is to display ads from third party services. The most popular ones are Google (AdSense) and Overture. Like many other bloggies,  due to the  urlLink Program Policies , Google may not approve your application to display AdSense ads on your blog . Overture is another way to try but doesnt rate that well. Infact, even overture requires you to sign up with Commission Junction. Again, a mere waste of time with not much fruitful result.  How to get arond? Find out service providers providing similar services like Google AdSense program having lesser restrictions than popular programs like Google AdSense. One such pay per click program is  urlLink Adhearus . Adhearus, in many ways, better than Google's AdSense program. Apart from the choice of text and image ads, they also provide a right click on the ad that can be used by other advertisers to put ads on your site. The minumum amount they pay, for example, is four times the minimum amount Google pays per click. Also, the minimum amount that needs to be earned before receiving your check is also 1/5 of what other ad servies require.   How to get started?  Simple. Just fillup a simple form and Adhearus will have your site reviewed in hours and you can start earning. In fact you can start putting ads right after getting registered. You may   urlLink click here   to apply for adhearus pay per click program. They provide a javascript code that can be used to place in your HTML code. This reduces the tech-now-how required for you to get started apart from the marketing costs involved in getting advertisers to your site.  How much do you earn? Varies. Mainly on the theme of your blog, number of visitors and the targetted ads. But if you are lucky, you can atleast earn the domain registration and hosting charges. There is no gurantee on how much you can earn but if your blog is earning you profits, do cosider sharing the same with me ;)  Other ways to earn money. Place relevant affilate buttons of the sites that reward you on the basis of the clicks or customer sign ups. An example is hosting provider's affiliation that provide special discounts to the visitors visting your blog and pay you a nice percentage.  Once your blog becomes popular, you may also place an ad inviting sponsorship advertisement that run in a simpler fashion.  Let the advertiser pay you a fixed amount for a fixed period, irrespective of the number of clicks and impressions that are made.   Is it good to place ads on your blog? Yes. As far as the ads are relevant, un-annoying and add up some value to the visitor.  Happy blog earn ing!
