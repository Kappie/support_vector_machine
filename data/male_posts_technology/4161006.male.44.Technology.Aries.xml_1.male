I wish I could've shown this to my daughter Tasha. Maybe someday...  It's been raining a lot this summer. I just wrote a poem called "Longfellow Trail". The pain comes through in my poems. I should try writing happy poems. Na! When I fall in love I'll write happy poems. What I write now are deep, emotional, reflective soul-searching poems. I write them for music. I create the music later. It's weird. I'm here where I want to be, and I love it here in the mountains. But I can't help feeling really lonely. I don't like being around crowds, and I love to hike trails where no one's around. It's what I do. The rain here is starting. It reminds me of the emptiness in my heart. I sit here where I'm happiest, but I'm so sad and lonely. I come to these places and take in the beauty, longing for someone to share it with. I dream about love when I'm here. Someday...  When this lonely feeling hits me, I don't feel like being around people. What I long for is someone to love. I want to love someone and someone love me so bad. Someone who would love to hike in this old growth forest. I guess I need two things in life. Someone to love, and the mountains. I here children coming up the trail. A family. A happy family. How beautiful. That was me long ago, with Tasha, 4 years old, asking her Daddy questions like "Daddy, are there any bears here?" "Daddy, can you put me on your shoulders?" It breaks my heart. The tears are coming again. Just like the rain. I need somebody to love. To help me wipe away this pain. It hurts so much.  This pain, this loss, is driving me. My emotions are driving me. Without them, I would be dead. The sun will shine again, shine down on me, and I will be happy again. She'll be smiling for me then, on Longfellow Trail...  Well, it's time to go. I have to hike down the mountain and then drive 4 1/2 hours. I don't want to be driving on the turnpike late at night. The last time I did it changed my life forever...      Longfellow Trail     It's starting to rain again I'm feeling my pain again I'm looking for love again On Longfellow Trail  See her waiting for me then She'll be smiling for me then Sun is shining on me then On Longfellow trail  (Chorus) Sun shining down on me On Longfellow Trail My lover fantasy On Longfellow Trail This is where I'll always be On Longfellow Trail   I feel so lonely here So melancholy here I'll always come back here On Longfellow Trail  The skies are darker now Rains falling harder now Feels like I'm drowning now On Longfellow Trail  (Chorus)
