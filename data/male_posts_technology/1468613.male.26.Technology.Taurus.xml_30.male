James driving Amy, Kaia and I around Melbourne in search of KFC for two hours while I played with the radio and Kaia kept telling James to 'SLOW DOWN!' even when he was doing 50kph in a 70kph zone. James had told us of a mythical KFC on Smith St which we were unable to find so we gave up and went to McDonalds and then, of course, came home and watched about 20 minutes of Moulin Rouge before passing out.  Gede, isn't it nice to know that some things never change?  Loveyoumissyoucomehomesoon!!  P.S. Kaia's hair looks GREAT :)
