I got an IQ of 112 I got 54 out of 70 I got 3 wrong on language I got 2 wrong on memory I got 6 wrong on logic I got 3 wrong on numbers I got 2 wrong on perception I beat both of my parents, which was good. My dad got an IQ of 94 and my mum had an IQ of 106. Any way i am very pleased about that as it means i am above average. Yippee anyhow what did the rest of you lot get? that is if you did the quiz !
