Parents were already writing in to the strait times forum last week telling MOE to extend the school holidays by a week but the damm government as usual ignored them; but after a kid was infected last week they do an about turn and give in.  Call me a paranoid android but the thing I am really worried about is when I go to work in the morning , the MRT is packed like crazy and if really sueh sueh(unlucky) got someone near me with flu i think its really gonna freak me out. OK maybe i am overreacting but I dun know have to admit I am kinda scared.
