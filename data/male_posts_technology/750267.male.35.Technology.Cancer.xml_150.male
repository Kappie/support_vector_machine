I don't agree with everything the writer says, but it's interesting to hear a point of view that has been stifled for so long...  Of course, it helps that the writer starts the article off with some interesting figures:   On Friday, economists at Goldman Sachs raised their 2004 federal budget deficit forecast to $525 billion (up from $475 billion), and set their 10-year cumulative deficit target at $5.5 trillion (up from $4.5 trillion).   In 2001, the CBO projected a $5.6 trillion surplus over 10 years. Now, it looks like a $5.5 trillion deficit over that same period. Why isn't anyone asking where $11.1 trillion went? The money has to flow into somebody's pockets... whose?   You can't just say "defense". That's a cop out. The 150,000 soldiers in Iraq are not earning $7.4 million per year each. So the $1.1 trillion a year isn't all going for salaries. So when the government says they're going to increase defense spending, what they really mean to say is they're going to pay billions of dollars to American defense contractors for new equipment. That isn't a bad thing necessarily, but let's be honest and say exactly where the money is going.
