(now that I got your attention, maybe you would like an explanation)  So, I graduated from Seattle Pacific University last year and went to Europe for 6 weeks. (A Tim's adventure which will someday be packaged into a little (*big*) website for all to see and love) Oh wait, the whole virgin thing... Umm... basically I haven't gotten laid yet, that's how I'm a virgin. Don't get me wrong, I'd like to have sex, just haven't gotten around to it yet. For right now I'm content with  urlLink Self love    Back to the whole game worker thing.... Wehn I get back from Europe I start working for a dot com, and get hired on as the highest paid webdeveloper there. (Granted I don't think I'm the most highly skilled web dev, but I asked for a lot since it was the internet BOOM and all. Well, come January, said Dot com runs out of money. (*This is after I buy a 2001 Toyota Celica in November*) They decide to drop to 50% employment. Well, I was one of the "lucky" few they asked to stay on at a major salary cut. I stayed with them until the money dried up for real in March. At which point I went on uneployment.  Then the tricky stuff starts happening. Since I'm bored most of the time, I start writing my memoirs, apply for undergraduate work at SPU for a degree in Christian Theology, and basically sit and play video games all day. I contact about 7 "recruiters" or placement agencies, but nothing comes through.  Well, I get accepted to SPU and go in to meet with my financial Aid officer, who is great, very helpful. While I'm there, I check the job boards. I see a web dev job opening for a small company (7 peeps). So I figure what the heck, unemployment is almost run out so I send them my resume. (This is on Monday) Wednesday night they call me for an interview on thursday. Thursday i go in and get the job. I start friday.  Now, my buddy, who is a game tester calls me up and says, "Dude, they're looking for peeps to hire and send me your resume". So I do. I get called from Volt during the week after my interview with said small company. "So, MS is hiring a game tester to play new games and tell you what you think of em." says Volt person and can I come interview. I say "Hell yeah" then go to job interview. Well, I got the job, which is fine considering, said small company only wanted to hire a part time person.  This is my hectic life in the year 2001. I am now not going to SPU, but am working 2 jobs at aroun 60 - 70 hours a week. Well, back to work...
