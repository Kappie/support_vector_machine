I am awaiting for my digital camera! 3.2 megapixel nothing to shout about. And best of all it is free! There two spare monitor over there next to my knee for my repair work and configuration work.    urlLink     My Messily Organised Computer Table! YES YES YES that is my blog I was still laughing at my friend's god damn funny face. Notice the new Sexy Fax machine and this keyboard I never regret buying this keyboard from packard bell it is so damn nice to type!   urlLink     I am so boring! Actually I am taking a rest after doing my proposal and task management review. Tracking how much time I am left with! Whether I still can afford some time over the weekend for some mahjong session! I want someone to play mine sweeper!!! MSN that is.  Another thingy is that the wireless router on top right hand corner is connected to singnet for 9 days already. Should I keep it running or should I restart it? 654 MB of data received so far! Not bad huh?
