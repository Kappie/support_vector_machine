Here's the response I wrote:   ...I couldn't shake the feeling of laying on my back in a field of daisies, coaxing the clouds with my eyes into giant whales and majestic sky ships, sails billowing to carry them off to some distant horizon.  Lately I've been reluctantly shutting myself off from lazy afternoons in my mind, trying to focus myself on a world that I can only half imagine somewhere out in the mysterious 'there', where careers are made and my debts repaid.  I used to love weaving little stories, little patchworks of pictures and poems, little rhymes like daisy-chains to set on my head as king of the clouds, happy on my throne of words.  But the words left me.  My education sapped from me the nectar I squeezed from life, the simple pleasures I had idly sipped upon, oblivious of how good I had it.  Somehow the belief that I must reach for more - become something more - sucked the air from my sails and set me to dreaming of distant cities filled with busy people with busy jobs and busy lives.  But like the clouds I kept these visions far above me, distant, safe.  I stayed close to home, pushing my way through college in the town in which I was born.  Under the watchful wisdom of the white pines of my home I forced myself into a culture and a society that turned my stomach and suffocated my dreams.  Somehow I limped through, earned my piece of paper that qualifies me fit for fine society, and arrived here - half-way to middle age, searching for a new place to settle down and begin my second life.  This morning I was searching for an apartment, a career, a lifestyle in a city where I thought I could see myself living.  This afternoon, I found myself in a field of daisies.  I don't quite know why, but I feel like after reading your post I woke up - not from a dream - but into a dream, a familiar dream where the edges of the world are soft and forgiving and open to gentle breezes and light touches.  I don't know who you are, but I wanted to give to you my deepest thanks for reminding me how to see.  May peace, wisdom, and grace always be with you, A young man from a distant coast.
