The warrior couldnâ€™t look more disinterested, and as a result, the audience eventually begins to feel the same way."  seems to me like that is what happens in the Iliad ... Achilles withdraws from the fighting until his honor can be restored ... Hopefully Wolfgang dishes Achilles return in the movie the same way it is served in the epic.
