But discounting my ideal candidate and the Libertarian candidate as very unlikely possibilities, Wes moves up to #4.  Taking out Dean as the likely candidate for President, Wes moves up to #3 behind Edwards and Kucinich.  That leaves him on the short list for VP, which is a good thing.  A Dean/Clark ticket would get my vote any day.
