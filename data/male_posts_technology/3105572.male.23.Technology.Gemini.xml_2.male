       
      My Bible Study today was on  2 Chron. 20:12 .  The Main idea is that no matter what we are facing God is the victor of all our battles. The Battle is the Lord's.  Just like when Israel was facing an army more than double their size. They cried out to God for help and what did he say but "Do Not Fear, The Battle is Mine!"  I Think that if we learn to put more of our faith in Christ and call out to him when we are in need that God will be there in a flash.   Amen!
