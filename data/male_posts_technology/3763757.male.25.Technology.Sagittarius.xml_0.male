The man is incredibly charismatic, despite being hopelessly republican and sometimes showing shades of exteme right-wing bias. Almost 99% of his past shows have him out-smart his guests and speakers with witty and sensational dialog, and I am yet to see one of his guests verbally bludgeon him into submission. I do not agree with many of his views though, but watch the show for the sheer entertainment aspect of it. The show airs on FNC weekdays @ 8 PM and 11 PM EST.
