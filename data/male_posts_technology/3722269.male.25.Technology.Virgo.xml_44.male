Jog to servo up the road: 13 odd minutes. Jog back from the servo: 13 odd minutes. Distance.. I guess about 800metres? round trip might be 1.5k? certainly not -more- Result: coughing and wheezing like a 90 yr old asthmatic biznatch. when I got -to- the servo, my hands were totally frozen, my face red and chillblaney, so I bought two cans of sugar-free redbull, and holding one in each hand, straight out of the freezer, jogged back, but by the time I got close to home, I was warm, hands were warm, and now I feel fine.  I do however still maintain that running only ever was, and only ever should be considered a -survival- technique. It is ok to run away from something bigger/faster/hungrier than you, it is not ok to jog for 'fun'. I'm jogging to get away from something bigger , fatter, and hungrier than me - the old me. A couple months of jogging, and he'll be long gone. Fucker.  Reminds me of a story, about these two guys who are going for a jog through a forrest, somewhere in africa, they're walking into the forrest to the track they normally run on, carrying their running gear with them. They were just about to the track they normally run, when a terrible crash causes them to spin around to see something right behind them, big, noisy and ferocious, land right on the track. A tiger. A hungry looking tiger at that, with a distinctly viscious look in his eyes. There's a moment of silence as the two friends look at one another in disbelief, then they look at the tiger again. One runner, crouches down and takes off his walking shoes and starts to put on his running shoes, an action that puzzles his friend, who comments "what are you doing? there's -no- way you're gunna outrun a tiger!?!" the guy continues putting on his running shoes before standing up and replying "I dont have to outrun the -tiger-, I only have to outrun -you- "  Something to think about.
