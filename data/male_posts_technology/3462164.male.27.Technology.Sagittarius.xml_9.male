Fortunately, a couple of months ago, Sci Fi channel confirmed that Farscape will be returning in the form of a mini-series, known as Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars. While there isn't an official date, it is expected to premiere in October 2004. As that date draws closer, pictures from the production are starting to be released on the internet.  urlLink Click here  for a page with links to tons of pictures from The PK Wars, and then come back here and post your thoughts.
