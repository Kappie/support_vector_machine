Never ever used to get frustrated or agitated with extra work load or pressure inserted in order to get the work done. Tense yea but no signs of displeasure. I would never allow people remarks/comments regarding me get on top of my head and blow me. This isn’t Saad I knew, this isn’t me. Recently I have noticed a change in me, I would easily get annoyed if loaded with extra work and having people constantly inquiring about the status. I would pass angry glance at drivers(specially bikers) making stupid moves on road (I still believe their licenses should be snapped and they should be whipped for their acts). I would make sure to have a talk with the person who either steps on me in bus or blocks my way or just bumps me without caution. And yea I would even yell at myself like I feel right now cozits 2:45 AM and i shud be in bed not here posting argghh. Couple of days back I asked a colleague to ---k off just because twice he called me “badey mian” (I still feel he was rude) but that doesn’t give me right to show him my middle finger. And yea I would show it to any driver who would honk his horn for no reason. Two months back I had again lost my cool, when a colleague was constantly asking me when I will be done with my work and that too 15 minutes after assigning it and we both knew it wont take less than 2-3 hours. This is not me. My GIKI friends would agree ( I hope they do :))   When I came back to Karachi, I used to find it quite silly when people show ed their anger at each other. Then I had this fear that one day I might be one of them and now when I look at myself, I feel my fear is turning into a reality. I am becoming one of them, frustrated of this world, wanting to get things done their own way, having thin temper control line. But I don’t want to be them, I want to be once again ultra cool and be a person who would shrug off any remark, any annoying act with a smile. I want to be Saad again.
