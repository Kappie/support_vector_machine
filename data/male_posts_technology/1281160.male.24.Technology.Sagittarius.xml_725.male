Thought of reading the whole thing sometime later. Some interesting discussion is going on. .... I accept valli's and kicha's arguments..everything depends on how you plan your life...External factors may try to take control over your life only when you are allowing it.           I bought a book of osho 'A cup of tea'  and trying to read it. Just gone through 2 pages till now. It's good. Valli..It's nice to hear taht you are coming to india...Just I got to know.When you are coming? I am going home this weekend. taking leave on friday for my friends marriage. Planning to visit cbe on friday..let me see.        Hope Again I will be tied up with work from next week. My PL is going to onsite for different assignment and we will be doing all the co-ordination and work. Next week I going to have some training in .Net.         I am searching for a good library here in adyar...After I joined here I can tell you that I haven't finished reading any book. Just 2 or 3 books I started and it's still in half way..:((        I got mail from vijaybabu.. he was describing his locality like his house is surrounded by gardens, swimming pool ,etc. Hope he is enjoying life.
