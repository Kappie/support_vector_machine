At the time of writing this company has the worst technical support of any ISP I have ever used - and that is saying something - I've lived and worked in 6 countries over the past 10 years or so.  Here goes:  Day 1:  get back to the house at 9PM on Friday night. I'll just check my email. Hmmmm internet access is down. Oh well this is nothing unusual for Cablemas it should be back up by morning. They are probably doing some unannounced maintenance on the network.  Day 2:  Saturday. Still no access. Call the cable company. They can't do anything until Monday morning. They promise to send someone first thing Monday morning.  Day 3: Sunday. No chance of anything happening today, ever.  Day 4:  Monday midday. Still no cable guy. Call the cable company. The cable guy finally arrives at 2PM. The cable guy can't find anything wrong but replaces all the outside cables anyway and the modem for good measure. He intimates that they had some problems with an upgrade over the weekend and that soon I will get my internet access back. 6PM still nothing. Call the cable company. They will send someone out first thing tomorrow: this time they will send a network guy.  Day 5:  Tuesday morning. The network guy arrives. Difficult to tell the difference between the network guy and the cable guy. After some wire twiddling outside the network guy brings his own modem into the house. Interesting - his modem seems to work okay. No he can't leave his modem because the cable company only gives the network guy a 5K modem for testing purposes. Apparently Cablemas doesn't trust its own workers not to use the modem at home for free internet access (what a company). First thing tomorrow they will send out a guy to replace the modem since the network guy doesn't carry modems for customers. Duh!  Day 6:  Wednesday. The cable guy should have been here between 8AM and 9AM. He finally arrives at 11AM with a modem. He proceeds to swap out the modem. How strange the modem still doesn't work - it must be a network problem. He talks by radio to a few friends back at base. Well it appears that they have had some internal network problems since the weekend and that they are now working on this (after 5 days). He promises that internet access will be restored within the hour. 10PM: still no access. Call technical support. They will send someone out in the morning. Here we go again.  Day 7:  Thursday. Still no access. My wife (Mexican) goes to the cable company and insists on speaking to the boss. She also delivers a long letter explaining all the problems we've had with Cablemas. The boss promises to look into it. I won't hold my breath.  Well that's as far as we've got. Still no access on day 7 but fortunately during the time period that I've been waiting for Cablemas to restore access, I contracted the services of Telmex the Mexican national telephone company with their ADSL product Prodigy/Infinitum. I now have my internet access back. I'm still waiting for Cablemas to fix their problems.
