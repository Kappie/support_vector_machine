Is the cost we're now paying, however, even remotely worth Nader's having run? Especially since alternate-party sentiment appears to be less than it was in 2000? Is voting to "make a statement" a responsible action when the outcome causes such suffering and waste?  Voting for the lesser of two evils is not a pleasant choice, but consider that the lesser of two evils is LESS EVIL. In this world, sometimes less evil is the best we can do.
