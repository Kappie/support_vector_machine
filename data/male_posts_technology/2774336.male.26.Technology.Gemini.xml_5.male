       No post yesterday, my first day of work at my new job.  I was tired and busy last night, not to mention a little overwhelmed.  The details aren't too interesting, but I'll tell you something that is.   The day started with new employee orientation.  Out of the 7 new employees starting, only two of us were going to be working at corporate headquarters.  The other five new hires left the building after orientation to attend training.  Myself and one other woman stayed behind to meet our managers.   My manager came into HR to greet me and show me the way around the building.  I was escorted to my cubicle on the third floor where my new IBM laptop was waiting for me.  I was given a very large book of software cd's and left to install the software that I needed.  And that is when I realized: I was home.   Sitting in my cubicle, watching my computer's progress bar, I leaned back in my office chair and sighed.  During both of my interviews and orientation I had been nervous, tense, and my stomach  already sensitive  had been clenched tight in a furious ball of pain.  But here at my desk, for the first time at this building, I was relaxed.  The din of office conversations, the quiet ring of a random phone, the constant hum of hundreds of computer cooling fans all wrapped around me like a blanket.  I had forgotten how good it felt to be in the office.  I didn't realize how much I had missed it.   There was a meeting or two.  There were faces and names and hands to shake, and the sinking feeling of realizing that I had already forgotten the name, the face, and the hand of the last one before I turned to the next.  And of course, there were the stomach problems, but no one seemed to notice them aside from me.  Thankfully it was "Welcome!", "Glad to have you aboard!", "Nice to meet you!" instead of "What is wrong?", "You don't look so good" or "Are you OK?".   It was a good first day.   Today was better.   Today I was invited to a few more meetings, and I received my first three projects.  I was also signed up for training (which is always fun, getting paid to learn!) and started real work about fifteen minutes before I closed my laptop and headed for home.  Tomorrow I hope to be able to sit at my desk all afternoon without moving, perhaps sipping some tea, and get a great deal of work done. People are counting on me to deliver, and it feels really good.
