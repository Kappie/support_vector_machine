The definition they give for terrorists is pretty loose, don't you think?  To whit: "any association, organization, entity, coalition, or combination of two or more persons with the primary or incidental purpose of supporting any politically motivated activity through intimidation, coercion, fear, or other means"-  which, pared down, could include pretty much anyone with an opinion, couldn't it?  I mean, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney are a "combination of two or more persons with the primary or incidental purpose of supporting any politically motivated activity" - and I'll bet they mean to achieve their nefarious ends "through intimidation, coercion, fear, or other means"... Mainly because "other means" includes absolutely everything.  I'm going to call that 800 number and report them.  Then I'm going to throw paint on some gerbils for wearing fur and send off some hate mail to Indonesian kids for using Nike products. Oh, and Eva says she'll post a picture when she oh look, a squirrel!  Sometimes I think she has some kind of attention deficimy foot is itching.
