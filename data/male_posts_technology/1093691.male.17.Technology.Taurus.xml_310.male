Brad Pitt's bottom sounds like a very good piece of artwork, anyone fancy a trip to Madame Tussauds sometime soon........................??! Anyway! I've been at work all day and my knees and feet are killing me, but I really enjoy it cos it is so interesting and I'm active all day! Beats sitting on my butt watching the tv or whatever! Anyway, she has decided she needs some extra help next week, so I'm working Friday as well as Saturday, and possibly even Wednesday and Thursday! So extra money coming my way this week, lol! Its quite nice though cos Tina (who works there) likes to gossip, and sometimes when its quite we just chat about stuff! She's always asking my what I'm doing tonight (as in Saturday night) and it's quite sad cos I always have to say "staying home and watching tv"!!! At least at the mo I have the excuse that I'm too busy revising for my exams, lol. But she was quite interested to hear about the BonJovi concert that I've got lined up! Weather is horrible today, it's been threatening to rain all day, and even when it wasn't drizzling it was soooo windy! half the pots outside the shop decided to blow away, so one of my duties today was chading them all down the road! One of the wheelie bins also decided to go for a roll which was quite annoying, it wouldn;'t stay still! In the end I tied it to one of the metal bins. I really shoudl shut up now because you lot probably really don't want to hear about my dustbins and whotnot but hey! My faminly aren't in a listening mood cos they've been digging up the patio all day and are now comatosed on the sofa, so I thought I'd come and blog to get everything out of my system! That's the problem with not talking for a lot of the day- you have to let it all out eventually! Anyway, I really will leave you in peace now, have fun tomorrow guys and don't eat too much chocolate! We've got a novel new experiment going on in our house- no chocolate of any sort for easter. Whoppee. But I guess I'll be thankful in the long run! Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
