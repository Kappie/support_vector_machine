I was in the hospital on Monday and back to the doc on Wednesday (original pain meds weren't working well enough).  When I wasn't in pain, due to the painkillers which made me sleepy...when I wasn't sleepy, I was loopy.  Needless to say I didn't get a damn thing done and I missed a week of work.  Fortunately, it finally passed though I still feel a bit "off" from my normally chipper self.  Serves me right for not drinking enough water and taking better care of myself.
