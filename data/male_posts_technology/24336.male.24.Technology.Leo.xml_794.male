It was at least 50 coins, so I immediately bent down to help her pick it up.  She was a bit older, so she let me pick it all up.  Her husband must have been at the bathroom, because he showed up just as I finished.  They both thanked me and started to walk off.  Just then, I got a good look at her husband.  Turns out, it was Lenny Wilkins!  Quote from NBA.com about  urlLink Lenny :  "Lenny and his wife Marilyn have three children, Leesha, Randy and Jaime, and two grandchildren, Ashley and Nicole. They make their off-season home in Seattle."  Pretty cool.
