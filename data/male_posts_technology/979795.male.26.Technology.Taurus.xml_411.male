Gotta admit, it was my first visit to a sushi bar. Nice experience. Somewhat expensive but hey, it's not like I do it very often.  We hd a long chat about everything and I felt really really relaxed and so happy to see people from Uni again. Was quite touched actually. Sometimes a simple gesture like a random invitation out for dinner or a cup of coffee leaves me beaming for the rest of the night. Of course, not everyone will have the same effect. Only those who I deem to be good close friends.  Was nice hearing everyone being crazy and reminiscing about the days back in Uni. Gosh ... do I feel old now. But hey, I'm really enjoying my life not. I'm not in a job that's killing me slowly, my working environment is filled with cute happy kids and nice people, I train regularly in Aikido. I think I can pretty much handle the bad stuff that comes along with the good.  Life is good to me, and life goes on.
