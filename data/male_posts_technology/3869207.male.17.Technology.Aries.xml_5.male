Finally, with the help of about 3 or 4 programs, I finally got the bug flushed out of my system, and I'm feeling quite relieved now.  I swear, if I ever come face to face with one of the developers of these adware programs, there may be one less schmuck crawling about on the face of the earth (and I am NOT refering to myself thank you!).  So anyway, I'm back and tomarrow I'll get back to the swing of posting and stuff.  Till then, adios!
