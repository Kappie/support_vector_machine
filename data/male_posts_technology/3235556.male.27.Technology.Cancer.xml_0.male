So far we've lost about 700 American lives over in Iraq, and we're worried about how some of our troops treat Iraqi prisoners? Maybe if we start treating some of our prisoners here at home this way, people will think twice about committing a crime and going to jail.  The soldiers involved in this so called scandal are posted all over the internet as criminals, meanwhile, the half-wit, common everyday brainwashed citizen, tuned in to his 6 'o'clock news program is going to start believing that treating an Iraqi prisoner of war is an atrocity.  Just a couple days ago, Nicholas Berg was beheaded on video for the world to see, but as the media does its usual number of making mountains of mole-hills, forget that a young man was wrongly executed by Iraqi militants, we're fussing over war criminals being treated unfairly.  If you want to go back in time real quick to WWII, and study how unfairly the Germans treated their prisoners.  I rest my case...  Anyway,  Bear in mind that, in comparison, the U.S. treats it's prisoners like royalty compared to how some foreign countries have treated their prisoners.  It's no wonder why there's chaos over there.  Those people don't fear us, and they never will.  In many cases our soldiers can't fire even if fired upon.  If those people knew for one moment, that our soldiers would publicly behead anyone tearing through a military post or blockade, or anyone shooting at an American soldier, the chaos would end.  Again, I cannot emphasize enough, that I don't think we should be over there, but... We're being shot at, and being humiliated, and I just think we should start taking names and kicking some butt. urlLink   urlLink
