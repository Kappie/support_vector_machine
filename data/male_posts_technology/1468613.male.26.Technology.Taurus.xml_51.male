Another exam in just 2 days. Oh, the pain.  But...BUT! James and I are going to have the best Saturday ever because we're getting jiggy with  urlLink Harry  and then we're going to have the best Sunday ever because there's going to be a  urlLink DOUBLE EVICTION  (Bye Kim! Bye Vincent!). Oh, and Kaia's home :) :) YEAH!
