But my sup was quite understanding about the whole thing. He asked me about other problems I might get stuck in and where I needed help/advice. Also reminded me not to be too worked up about the Project Inspection next week. Gotta just keep my cool and prepare some stuff and get ready to be asked some questions. On top of that, I need to prepare for my mega important Jap test coming on Wed. Wah, this week siong man. Gonna work hard this weekend, but not before a good rest tonight. Juz loaned some videos from school library and got some classic shows. I'll relax a few hrs tonight first.  Even the next 5 wks looks like a break from Aikido. Sigh, sure would like to go train somewhere but I guess it might be an overkill. Taxing myself too much is a definitely no-no for me in my Aikido training. Wanna improve and not lose interest. I really want to keep at this long term throughout my life. Hope that can be done. Anyway, I can always go train my swimiming this coming holiday. Woohoo.  O yea, I just found this really fantastic site called www.vcdhelp.com. They offer tips and advice on creating VCD and DVD from a variety of format. From hardware, software to tips and techniques. Fantastic site.
