The human mind is chaotic, it has no order and lacks consensus, your ape brain tells you to rape, pillage and murder, your conscience tells you that you can't do that. This is the very definition of  dissonance: "A harsh, disagreeable combination of sounds; discord.", yet such a good descriptor of human nature.

That's what the name 'dissonance of thoughts' is striving to reflect.
