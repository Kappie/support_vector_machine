At least sites/organizations like Salon and Rush Limbaugh are honest about their view of things.   urlLink The press' representation of the public hearing I presented at on Monday   Now, there is nothing untrue in the article.  But, it leaves the impression that there was only dissent.  There were 5 speakers - 1 (Mr. Wilmont) expressed environmental concerns, 1 (Mr. McHaffey) expressed concerns about property value and noise, the other 3 were speaking in favor of the project.  Mr. Wilmont's comments were well expressed and received (unlike some public hearings I have attended where people were ranting and raving), and his comments are acurately and fully presented in the article.  Mr. McHaffey was more concerned with the rezoning of his property from residential to industrial in the past couple of years.  He has consistently (for the last 6 years anyway) complained about helicopter noise.  The proposed development will neither add to nor subtract from the helipcopter operations.  Again, while nothing printed is untrue of what he said, the emphasis of his comments is misrepresented.  Given the title of the article, you would think that nothing positive was said on the hearing.  There were 3 people speaking in favor of the project, and 4 of the 5 Commissioner's (same as Supervisors in Virginia) had positive comments and expectations resulting from the proposed expansion.  The last Commissioner did not comment.  My point is this.  If the press can misrepresent something relatively simple with a negative tilt, how much do they get wrong on issues where people don't know the details?  Reporters are supposed to report the facts and leave the opinions for the editorial page.  Not presenting the whole truth, in my opinion, is the same as stating your own opinions in a news story.
