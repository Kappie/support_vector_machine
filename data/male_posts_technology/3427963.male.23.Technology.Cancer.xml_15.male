It was sort of a fruitful nite as i did enjoy myself and it was realli nice to see all the frens from secondary school eca again. Although we met up quite often, ( well, definitely more often than my secondary school classmates.)  we still had so much to catch up. It had been a long time since i went to a chalet and i did not realli feel tired even after chionging on fri nite. But initially i didnt want to stay overnite but after some persuasion and psychoing by my frens, i drove the van which my fren rented back home, bath, change out of my contact lenses and headed straight back there.          Went back there and they started playing black jack and toking bout bad luck.....i join the game and during my first rd, the banker got a  ban ban .....KNS....i betted one buck and lost 3 bucks instantly. And the rest started blaming me for joining in the game and seriously i feel that it was a mistake to join the game after all cos eventually, i lost all my coins worth of 5 bucks. I stopped playing after that....not that i hv no money lah but u know u  suay  liow u still want to continue play and lost meh? After a while, another fren also lost everything and he jio me go downstairs drink...and we had a relaxing conversation accompanied by the nite breeze and GIN TONIC.....super relaxing and we kind of sat there til ard 6 in the morning and chatted about BGR, and everything we can think of lah.....its been a realli long time since i stay awake all nite liow. I'm like totally destressed after the chalet trip.....glad i went and in fact alone, if not i wouldnt have stayed overnite. And we brought the period of our frenship up and to my surprised, 10 yrs had passed and we had known each other for 10 yrs liow and am i glad we still kept in contact and we are still such close frens. And no doubt, this frenship will never end. In fact we org a gathering every now and then during the festive seasons most of the time if not jus a nite out for dinner. I'm so lucky to have this bunch of frens and to them, i wish them happiness and health for as long as they live.....cheers, and hopefully ah lau will hold his traditionally wedding soon and we shall have another round of celebration again. This time,  Bu zui bu gui, zui le bian wu gui...... haha Toast to frenship.....cheers!!!          CHEERS,     Teddy Teo yong sen (  luv y@n   )
