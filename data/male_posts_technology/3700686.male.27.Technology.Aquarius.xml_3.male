The 3 friends- George, Harry and the author (referred to as 'J' by his friends) take up this exercise for a change from their mundane lives. Of course, they also have fears of age catching up on them and fear that they suffer from diseases with complicated-sounding names! The author's dog Montmorency, always willing to be a part of the excitement also joins in.  The book is a chronicle of their travels upriver interspersed with the author's musings on various topics ranging from the silly, like how entertaining and exasperating it is to observe women towing boats, to events with historical significance like signing of the Magna Charta.  The humour is decidedly very British; the kind that one comes across in books by Wodehouse. Both Jerome and Wodehouse have perfected the art of describing incidents with dry wit, sticking to the British tradition of maintaining the 'Stiff Upper Lip' in doing so.  To be read by one and all! It takes you out of this world into one that is filled with fun and laughter! In Jerome's own words - the world persists in recognising him as the author of "Three Men in a Boat", though he has written other books that have far more to offer in terms of literary significance and humour in his opinion.
