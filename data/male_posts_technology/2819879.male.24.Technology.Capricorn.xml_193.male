Anyways... technically, I'm very much look alike going after this girl... (since all my friends told me to do so, regardless i only have 40 days left in taiwan... good friends...) but it's still undeniable that i'm still under the affection of my ex-gf...  This is so unfair.  [today is so hot]  If I fail, I have wasted my precious time.  Even worse, if I succeed, we'll still be apart in about an month.  Well.. but since I have choose to ­AÄ_, I'll keep ­AÄ_ till the end, i think.
