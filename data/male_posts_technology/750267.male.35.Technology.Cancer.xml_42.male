The project is called POPFile, and the software supposedly does a pretty decent job of detecting spam. Not only that, but there is almost nothing spammers can do -- there is almost no way to defeat it. The program classifies the emails I receive based on the statistical probability of certain words appearing in spam. At first, I need to "train" the software by classifying my mail as either spam or not spam. It does the rest. For instance, certain words (like viagra, debt, free, diet, etc.) appear mostly in spam, so when a new mail comes in, the software can make a decent guess of whether its spam or not.  What's interesting to me, is that in the last six hours since I installed the software, I have received nothing but spam. I'm finding it hard to train it to recognize my "personal" mail, because I haven't received any this afternoon.  Yes, that's a sad story in a way. Maybe I shouldn't filter out the spam... it might be too quiet without it.
