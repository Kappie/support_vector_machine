This world does make use of characters from a friends previous game session notes and fleshes out the campaign into an all encompassing battle against the players, and the planes. As yet mostly unwritten, this blog will document progress towards the goal of completion, in which play testing the campaign with friends will commence, and then if proven viable, a PDF of the game world will be delivered to Dungeons and Dragon's World Publishers for review, if approved, I will have accomplished my dream of writing a successfully published book.
