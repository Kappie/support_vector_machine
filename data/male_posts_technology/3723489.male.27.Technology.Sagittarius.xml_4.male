So, I have two questions:   When does Milwaukee settle down?  Why don’t I live here?  I’ve got some good pictures and I’ll be posting pictures of all the tournament winners along with some killer pictures of the venue and the show later in the week.  The  urlLink Darkness  made an appearance in our tent today.  If you didn't catch them on the stage you would have caught them in the tent.      ns
