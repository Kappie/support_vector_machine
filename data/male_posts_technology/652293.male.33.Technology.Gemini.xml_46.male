There is a house across the street that is for sale.  It has been changed from a house to 2 apartments and an efficiency.  The seller only wants 65k$ for it.  It looks like it needs a ton of work, but for only 40k$, you could turn it into a nice rentable place.  And you would still have only spent 100k$, in a neighborhood that is nice.  Granted, we are on the edge of the neighborhood, but it is still nice.  So maybe Claire's mom will buy in and fix it up.  Ugh, back to documentation.  My favourite part of the job.
