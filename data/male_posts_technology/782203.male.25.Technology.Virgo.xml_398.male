And it seemed so real that I actually checked my email to see if it was true,  ignoring the fact that there was no way in hell she could have had my email address, or if it was true she would have called me on Monday itself. People can be so irrational sometimes.   My temperature went back up to 37.9 . ARRRGGGH
