If u ask me, Other than White i dont find any good background color, but then i wont stop u from experimenting with colors. Happy coloring! and put the blog content in the center instead in the left. Like the white and grey layout. That really eases our reading. I am not satisfied with displaying blog content in one side, be it right or left. Right or left Center is the best!  Others look ok to me. will get back to u later Ranjini
