 Download the requisite files from  urlLink ftp://ftp.openbsd.org .  (I would suggest ports.tar.gz, src.tar.gz, sys.tar.gz and the entire i386 folder.)

 On your old OBSD machine (since you all have one), cd to the root of the new CD

 Use mkhybrid to make an ISO:  mkhybrid -b i386/floppy34.fs -c boot.catalog -l -J -L -r -o obsd34.iso .  (That final period is necessary!  Isn't it always?)
