As I identified those who might be performing at less than peak, the advise I received from Dr. Lawrence King at a recent meeting came into clear view. In order to have peak performers, you must stamp out mediocrity. How do you do that? I have setup 90 day reviews for some of my mediocre performers and am monitoring their performance. Can I get my employees to put out more? What is their motivation? I will have to inflict some kind of change to induce the necessary stress needed to make change. I know change is hard, but if you don't change when the company changes, you may find yourself out of a job. That is my thought.
