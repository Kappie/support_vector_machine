In that case, thank you and keep up the good work.  I've often thought some people should be sentenced to wear scarlet letters on their shirts. Not for such trivial and outdated crimes as adultery, but for more modern offenses, inconveniences against their fellow man (and woman). For example, some should be branded with an M for Moron, or BD for Bad Driver. Of course, I could be wrong. Wait, no I couldn't - I'm wearing my scarlet letter G (Godlike).
