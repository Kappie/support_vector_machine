So many Denny's and In-And-Out's and Jack-in-the-Box's and Motels6's along the way. Those simple signs -- "FOOD", "GAS". I enjoyed this driving. So American. 
 The arrival to Yosemite was wonderful. All those forests and mountains and waterfalls whose name i can't remember. A little after we came in we stopped at a vista point to take a piss and for some reason couldn't stop laughing at each for a few minutes. I decided to hide from El'ad to take a dump quietly and started climbing down the slope. El'ad stopped me before i totally lost my mind and maybe my life. Maybe it was some kind of oxygen poisoning. 
 When we arrived to the camp site the ranger reminded us to hide all the food and everything that has odor from the bears. They are really keen about it there.
