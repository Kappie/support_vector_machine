I then proceeded to pull out the 'Shiba and my Treo's HotSync cord, just so I could freak The Gavin out for my presence on her front lawn. I think I freaked out the two cool people playing frisbee outfront more than her...or her mom. I think she was the most phazed from some deranged hacker kid on her property talkin' bout how he knows her daughter. She should have come and met me! Damn. Anyways, I'm fucking tired, have the Awards concert @ RMHS tommorow, and nothing to do all day TuezdAi. Seriously. JQ and ROZ have their "experiment" which, quite frankly, scares the living whores out of me. Hmm...I'm re-reading that title.   "KELLY MUST THINK!!"   She does.       She has to.             Kelly smells nice.                  I have that bad, bad feeling like that one will get me shot.  -beej
