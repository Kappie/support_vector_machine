They provide a place to share your ideas and thoughts. You can use it to publish your stories, poems, essays.. whatever it is you have to say or if you prefer to read you can browse their extensive collection of Stories, Poetry and Classics.  Read. Write. Respond.   Now, since I was impressed very much by W. Somerset Maugham's quote  (see a couple of posts below this) , I signed up at  urlLink Lit.Org  yesterday and submitted a piece,  My Dieting Blues , that I had written quite some time back. And it was published!! Now, it features on their main page under the heading of stories. And guess what, I already got a comment on it with a rating of 7 out of 10! *LOL* ;-)
