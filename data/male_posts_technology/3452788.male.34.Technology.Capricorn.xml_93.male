We have said only a bare minimum, and only about mundane things, not a word about the gorilla sitting quietly in the corner of the room.  She won’t talk to me, won’t tell me what she is feeling.  She is going on with life, but keeping all her feelings inside.  Just like her note that time said, she doesn’t feel like talking about things to other people, so she may not say anything to her mom or sister.  I will probably find out, because the entire fam, including brother-in-law from Goldville, is descending on our house today for a lovely bbq get-together.  Maybe I will talk to my niece D., the 15-year-old alcoholic therapist.  We get each other pretty well.  No I haven’t stabbed myself yet, but I’m still thinking about it.  I have been awake since 8am, but just getting up and showered now.  I don’t really care.  I am the hideaway again, talking to the blog bcuz Anne won’t.  We lay next to each other for over an hour this morning, I gave her a backrub trying to be nice, but the deafening silence continued.    Maybe I’ve succeeded in driving her away, the wedge splitting the wood, the first crack making it all the way through.  Like hard old oak, if we are doomed to separate, it will not be a quick break but a tough job to break through all the knotted fiber and cellulose holding us.  I don’t want that to happen, but I am more afraid every day that it might.
