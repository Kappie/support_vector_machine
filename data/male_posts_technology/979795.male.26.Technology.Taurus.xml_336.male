I think I can officially call my angbao collection complete by now. I'm pretty sure I've visited everyone I was supposed to and everyone that needed to come to my place had already been here too. Well I have to go pay my mat fees with my angbao money this week, plus use the remainder for a new pair of specs. Figured these things shouldn't wait too long anyway. Might as well settle it since I've got the moolah now and it sure beats withdrawing large amounts from the ATM later.  Sat I was supposed to visit Daniel's for lunch there. Prior to that, I was at a relative's when I got a call from David saying the visit was cancelled. Apparently Daniel's dad had a fall that morning and Daniel was at the hospital with him. Luckily that same afternoon, I got news that he was fine and we could still visit him if we were all able to. But I didn't think it was wise to be disturbing his family at that time.  There's been quite a number of accidents around my area just the past week alone. I know coz I've been hearing a lot of 'screeeeeech CRASH .... BANG!' and they've pretty much all sound the same. Just a few hours ago a car flipped on the road just opposite my place. Naturally there were police, ambulances and reporters. I think it's partly due to the wet weather which pretty much started on the day of CNY itself. Weird coincidence. Unfortunate too that all these area happening on a festive season.  This CNY I noted that I needed to know my limit when it comes to eating new year goodies. I feel a bit sick because I've been having too much pineapple tarts. I think it's because of all the butter that's giving me a very bloated feeling now. Wouldn't go for Aikido even if time permitted. Gosh, seriously man ... I feel like puking. The pineapple tarts were all home made by my aunt that's why they were especially good. Not too sweet like those you may find outside sometimes. Perfect I would say. I don't have much appetite to have my dinner later either, so bloated now.    OK I'd better go nap now. Hopefully my poor appetite will be better when I wake up.
