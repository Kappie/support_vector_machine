I'm not a follower of the genre so the only thing I can compare it to is The Postal Service, but it's not quite like that. One of the vocalists sings in a yelping "do you want fries with that" voice the other sounds like a teenage girl. Track 4, "Perfect Sound Forever" (isn't that a Pavement single???), is particularly beautiful with a melody that brings to mind Guided by Voices' "Tractor Rape Chain" and back and forth positive/negative boy/girl stanzas. However, some of the poppiest numbers approach Vengaboys territory. Other songs sound like (very good) Playstation game soundtracks.  I have only heard one of their songs prior to buying this album ("tigertail" from an earlier EP) and it was a crunchy fun guitar song. I find it interesting that Girls Are Short have roots in non-electronic pop. There is a great hidden track on  Early North American  where they bring out the guitars once again.  So yeah... go to the website, listen to the samples and, if you like, pick it up.   urlLink http://www.upperclass.to/girlsareshort.htm
