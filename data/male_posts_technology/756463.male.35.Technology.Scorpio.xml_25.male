And I'm not even that huge a football fan (well, not pro football, at least).    But... I'm totally against it being on CBS this year, and that's because they've decided they can't show the MoveOn.org ad called "Child's Pay."  Apparently it's too controversial.  But they're still running ads for President Bush... who I think is even more controversial.    Here's a link to MoveOn.org and the issue at hand.  Make up your mind for yourself.     urlLink (3/10/2004: MoveOn.org's picture has been removed - but the information is still there).
