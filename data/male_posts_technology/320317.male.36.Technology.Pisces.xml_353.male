   Based on  urlLink estimated numbers of users in the US , that is  only about 8%  of the total estimated number of users (164 million) have broadband connections. However, I am comparing total number of users in January 2002, and total broadband users in July 2002, but it's clear broadband has not caught onto the typical user, so once again bandwidth should be a major consideration when designing your site.
