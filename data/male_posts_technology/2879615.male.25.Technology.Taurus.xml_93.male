Umm oh and as an added bonus, today I get pulled over by the lovely and dependable Ewing Police after working a allllll day HALF A BLOCK FROM MY HOUSE!  As per usual, it was for a RIDICULOUS reason... 52 in a 40 and a broken tail light.  To make it even saucier, my registration expired 8 days ago. 8 DAYS AGO. Seriously, what the fuck. CAN I LIVE?! CHRIIIIIIIIIST. Yeah, sure, I have an extra $100 laying around to take care of this horseshit. FUCK you Ewing popo...you've assfucked me for the last time. Why don't you just stick me in a steel box and shove strips of bamboo up my fingernails?   Its 8:13. I need to get drunk and start fighting.  Fuck you.  Smash.
