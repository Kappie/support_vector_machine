Today I got as far as Marylebone, feeling sick, promptly was, and ended up having a panic attack.  Marvellous.  I have ended up spending Â£19.80 on a return trip to Marylebone station.  Since this morning I have seen a doctor, realised that I am very scared about this increasingly delayed operation, and slept almost all afternoon.  Not the best day in the world although I have had worse.  On the plus side, a friend is hopefully coming down to visit Saturday so that should be cool. :)  In the post I got two keyrings - a Lego ghost and a Lego vampire which are excellent, very cute and cheered me greatly.  Thanks to Ragdoll :)
