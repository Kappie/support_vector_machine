Bob McDowell at the induction impressed it well that this is one piece of article that is a MUST read.. we are talking about an article "IT Doesn't Matter" from Nicholas G. Carr published by Harvard Business Review. Looks like everybody who is anybody in the corporate world has read this. I need to read this as well. There are excerpts available on the internet. There is feedback on the article available at:  urlLink http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b02/en/files/misc/Web_Letters.pdf   Will add comments of mine once i am done reading the same.
