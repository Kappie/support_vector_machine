I hear its going to be the same with McGuire Industries :D. This is the company that issues H2S certifications. Since I've already been certified, in 2001, this refresher course won't take long. I will be doing this tomorrow, Tuesday.   Today I met with the safety representative for JR construction. I had to fill out an employment packet, which included 50 somewhat pages of Safety Issues and guidelines. This took about an hour. Afterwards I drove out to Cortez Colorado to take my Drug/Alcohol Test. I sped out there because I was running a bit late, got there on time, pissed in a cup, signed papers, and sped out of there. A funny thing happened to me while I was there waiting to sign papers...a bit weird, but funny. Sort of *wow, are they really this nice* kind of thing, or *hmm, I think I was just hit on* kind of thing. *shrugs* Anywho, I got back into MC, UT., at 12:00 or so, sat around for a while at the office (I can't go out into the field yet, my H2S hasn't been updated)...Then played the role of a mechanic/electrician until the 'part' was fully installed (Lighting harness wired from inside the motor compartment along the frame to the end of the truck). I got back home around 3:00, got online to check email, chatted with Chelle and Mel for a bit, got a call, was like "oh crap," and took off for Cortez again. There I picked up materials for a landscaping job I have to do. Had dinner, then came straight home...fed the "aminals"...and took a short nap (Was up since 5:00 a.m. :P). What a day(Two trips into town in one day)...tiring...*yawn*
