Paul Martin decided the best time for him to try and get his point across would be during game one of the final of Lord Stanley's Cup.  First off, I will start by saying that turned out to be a pretty intelligent move since there were 35 million viewers of that game, second most in CBC Hockey Night history.  I am going to post his little speech that us taxpayers paid for and I will add my comments in italics.   "Now, you can have a country like Canada, or you can have a country like the U.S., but you cannot have a country like Canada with the taxation levels of the U.S."   Is he implying that us Canadians want to be Americans?  Nothing against the Americans, but who in the hell wants to be an American?  Lets see: their economy is crap, almost the entire world hates them, they are fat, and they run around with guns shooting each other when they are not watching reality TV shows and cramming McDonald's down their throats.  I don't think the situation in America has much to do with taxes, whether high or low.  Every single Canadian I know is very proud to be Canadian whether they are young, old, born Canadian, or just recently moved here.  Mr.  Martin, you have just finished your first sentence and you have already pissed me off.    "Not without risking the various social programs, institutions and values that make us...Us."   The social programs that our federal government supports are the "Buy the votes from Quebec foundation" and the "Keep the unemployed Newfies drunk initiative".  We all know the institutions they support are marketing firms, themselves, and other various buddies and cronies.    "We look out for one another, that is the Canada we choose: prosperous, but generous of spirit. "   Yes, you guys do look out for one another.  "Here, have 500 million dollars courtesy of our taxpaying populace, which doesn't include us because we write the rules so they do not pertain to us."    "We hope that is the Canada you choose too."   To be honest, nothing of any value was said in the whole speech.  The guy is a buffoon and he was never chosen in an election to run our country.  Sad thing is I probably will vote Liberal because the  other fools are far worse.   Update: I have had a slight change of heart since I wrote this and it looks like the Conservative fools may not be as bad as I originally thought.  Only time will tell...
