Marci is sporting a new hairstyle courtesy of her good friend  urlLink Melanie .  The Marci Mullet     3. Dvl is on a secret mission, I can't divulge what it is because I  wooden  want to  cross  her. 4. Belle's blog must have been hacked, because she hasn't posted in a month. Has Norman Bates finally struck? 5. Jonnie is either Dennis Quaid or David Spade, or Randy Quaid, or the obviously Amish guy on the bicycle. 6. Sandra is coming to America in a week, let's just hope that Jonnie isn't the deranged maniac we all believe him to be and everything works out all right. 7. MadMathias is back from his cross country journey in which he played Dennis Hopper to urlLink  Monique's  Peter Fonda. 8. Rosa is stuffed up, but don't feel too sorry for her she's been perpetually stuffed up for the year and a half that I've known her. 9. Nancy is using stalling tactics to delay turning in her "real" self portrait, and I do not believe for one moment that  CJ  ate her homework.  I think that is all for now. Wait, oh yeah, we will be getting a new house member as soon as she replies to the invitation that I sent out yesterday. Yes, another she. Now that is really all for now.
