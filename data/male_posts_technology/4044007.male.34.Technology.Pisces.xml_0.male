He vowed to maintain troops in Iraq, which is what Bush has vowed to do as well. Kerry does stress acquiring more help and international participation. This differs from what the democratic party would like, which is the immediate and full withdraw of our troops. More and more of the companies involved in rebuilding Iraq are having their workers kidnapped. This has caused several companies to pull out. Unfortunately this has sent the signal to all of these fanatic groups that this type of operation is working and will only encourage them to do more of the same. They want all foreign occupiers out, no matter if they are here to help rebuild Iraq or trying to get a new government setup. My guess is these are the people that want to setup another dictatorship. As far as the companies rebuilding efforts go I could see some frustration over why all of these companies were offered the work instead of local contractors. They may not have all of the modern equipment, but it's just something they may be thinking when kidnapping these workers. It's obvious we need another plan. Our allies are backing out one by one and pulling their forces out. Pretty soon we will be the only ones left and the beheadings will continue without our withdrawal.  Falluja has heated up again as well. US air strike killed 13 Iraqis. We have injured civilians with these air strikes and flattened homes. This is just another wrench in the works.  Bottom line is there is no magic cure for this situation. It's going to get worse before it gets better. We have to get a native security force together as quickly as possible so we can start our withdrawal. We are obviously not helping the "peace" process and getting an interim government in place that will work. We simply can't force our will on them, it's obviously not working.
