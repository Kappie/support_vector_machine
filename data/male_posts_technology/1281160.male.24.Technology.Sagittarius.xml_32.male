Only people who r constantly accessing mails throughout the day may be interested in this. So, that makes me feel that this is not going to be a hit by any standards if posted to msitmmb and asking people to join. The smaller with better accessible people, the better.   We can post some useful things like the grammar stuff and some interesting pieces, technical or otherwise in this and use the mails for our normal communication like my start-of-the-day routines and whenever we expect some specific reply. In that way we can have the best of both worlds.   BTW, jax try to find out how to post images/files to this. coz, that'll be very useful...  Kicha
