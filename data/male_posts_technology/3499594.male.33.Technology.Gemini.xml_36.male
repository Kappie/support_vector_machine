Alot of promises were made, alot and I mean alot was themed around his Vietnam experience. In fact it seemed the main theme. Kerry even came out and after the 'thank you's' he saluted in front of the camera and said he is ready to serve. Nice. I was impressed with his speech. Many thought he would be a  bit mumbo jumbo, but I didn't find him to be that. But I also have to say, the whole week seemed a bit like a used car salesperson ramping up a good cheer to sell the car. But Kerry seemed to rev pretty good tonight. I still was waiting to hear what Kerry had done in the last few years while in Senate. I honor his experience as a Veteren, as I do all Veterens, my dad included. Yet, I never did hear of his accomplishments to assist the military veterens while in the office. I did find a link of some of his Senate history.  urlLink Who is John Kerry   Today was a good day. I felt I was able to get some things done at work, and I was able to eat with supervisor/peer this evening. I had a good chat with her. It was nice to just sit and talk rather than grab togo and back in the hotel. I will return back to PA in November. I fly out early tomorrow morning and I will be glad to get home. I really miss the family and will be glad to be in my own bed. :  )
