It perks up your curiousity when the author meets an elderly gentleman at the Indian Coffee House in Pondicherry. They start chatting and then the elderly man says, " I have a story that will make you believe in God. ".  Wanna see an interative promo of the book?? Well, then click  urlLink here  and enjoy an unusual and interesting promo of this book.  And ohh! if you want to read the author's note and the first chapter of  Life of Pi , then go  urlLink here .  [ via  urlLink Metafilter ]
