I personally think Ang Lee would be a great director for the third one.  Anyone but George Lucas.  Its sad how terrible the newest Star Wars movies have been.  But when you go back and watch the first 3 they weren't a lot better.  Mark Hamill was awful.  Better than Haden Christiansen, but still awful.  I think we were all a lot younger and dumber back then so they just seemed better.  It wouldn't hurt to bring back the bad ass guy with the horns and the cool light saber either
