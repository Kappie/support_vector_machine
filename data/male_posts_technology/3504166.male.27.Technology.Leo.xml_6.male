The laptop would be fine though.  It's all good, apart from a NASTY pause after the login screen. Must find out what's causing that and fix it.  The large screen is ... large.. but a little hard on the eyes, and so bright. The light... the light...   On day 1 of official study leave. Am well up to date with PM, and waiting for the fucking courier to arrive for shanny g's photo disks so I can go to lunch and then do the joy of data comms study.  Nootropics appear to be helping. We shall see come exam time. Have moved dosages to morning and lunch time - appears to be helping with the sleeping business..   Grr.. only now, at 1:15 does the old cheese tell me she has an appointment at 2pm. So I've been waiting around to have lunch with her for an hour for nothing. Doesn't she realise I am a *very important man*?!?!
