Ever the rain couldn't spoil the mood and atmosphere, well done to Andy for yet another, highly successful and well organized party. Although there is already things about the party I am regretting, doing/saying. Generally it was brilliant and nice to let my hair down 'as they say'. One word if anyone don't know what to talk about LEE. You could write a book on every day of his weird and mucked up life. It scares me. Talk to you all soon, Have a great weekend. Dave
