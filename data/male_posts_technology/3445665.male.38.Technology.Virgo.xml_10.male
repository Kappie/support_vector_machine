I am glad I live a couple thousand miles away from my relatives, but I still love them and like to see them once a year.  The family reunion is when they are on their best behavior.    I couldn't sleep last night.  Ate too late and had bad heart burn.   So I was afraid if I fell asleep I would breath in some vomit again.  I hate when I do that.  I really need to not eat or drink anything after like 8pm.  I put a small personal water cooler in at my desk.  It will give out 8 cups and keeps the water pretty cold.  It will only cool a cup of water every 30 minutes, but that is all I can drink anyway.  I hope that if I drink more water then I will drink less soda pop and that seems to be working so far.  With any luck I will drop a few pounds and feel better if I drink water instead of just pop all the time.  I woke up late and was fuzzy, by the time I goto work it was almost 3pm, the QA guy wasn't happy.  Skipped out on another meeting, they didn't need me at that meeting anyway.
