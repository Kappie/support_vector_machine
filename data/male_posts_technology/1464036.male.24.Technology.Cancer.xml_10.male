Last year Christie and I took our parents to Shogun, a Japanese restaurant where they cook the food in front of you with a mini show (very good), so we are going to make this kind of a tradition.  Thank the folks for all the support and just to say hi and make sure they are all communicating.  ILY.  --UPDATE-- Everything went great.  Food was excellent as usual and the service was great.  Parents got along, no casualties to report of, and everything went off without a hitch.
