Well... maybe it's a coincedence, if he has a SAAB Alchokey as I just posted this morning, (please refer to the previous article), he probably won't die.  Anyways, that reminds me of my uncle who passed away at around the same age last year.  He was because of stroke...  No Alchokey would have saved my uncle.  May all who passed away be able to rest in peace.
