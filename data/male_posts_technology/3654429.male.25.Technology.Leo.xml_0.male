It wasn't really stated as a question so should I respond to it?  How about just with a "thanks".   On the surface level it seems that this is just an innocent "hi" kind of thing, but I dated this girl for about a month, a little more (we went on several dates and I stayed at her house a bit), and once i got to know her I realized she wasn't that nice of a person.  So, forgive me for being a bit jaded or misguided here, but I think she is trying to be nicer than she really is because I stopped dating her.    Not only that, she was also one of those girls that wasn't quite sure what she wanted so she was pretty hot and cold aswell.  God I love the hot and cold ones!  (note the sarcasm).    So, my dilemna... Do I maintaing a friendship with her or do I just end all ties to her?   I have ended all ties with people like this before and I feel bad because I am very big on friends and family.   I think this time I am going to let nature run its course, just see what happens and not force a decision on anything.
