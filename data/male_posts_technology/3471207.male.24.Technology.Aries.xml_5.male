Perhaps it's the freedom one gets as he types away and expresses his innermost thoughts. Yes, it's a release of all those pent-up emotions and sentiments. Anyway, these few days i've not had an early sleep. Early as in before midnight because of someone who's been keeping me awake past midnight. Well, i can't blame that person coz it takes 2 hands to clap. And just a couple of hours ago, i thought i could get an early sleep but my friend called at 930pm and asked me to join him to play pool. Well, managed to get the car and off we went. And got back at about 1230am and my hair is almost dry now.   A brand new day awaits!
