Apple products have long tempted me to switch from the hell that is the PC world but the pricepoint has always been a tad too high. I tend to "convert" to PC terms and find that I usually get a far better deal.   Of course I'm still waiting for the day that Apple finally decides to release their OS on the PC platform. How I shall enjoy removing Windows from my system. MUHAHAHA!
