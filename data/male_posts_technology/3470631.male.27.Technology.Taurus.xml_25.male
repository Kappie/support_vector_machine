Snooze.   Anyway, one of the guys suggests that the place to be for single guys our age is at these new Speed Dating things - where you rotate and meet a bunch of chicks at this event where you pay like 50 bucks or whatever to sign up. Sounds horrible. Sounds like a job interview X 100 degrees of dating pressure/hell.   YET - is that what people do these days? Let's face it - I ain't meeting anyone worth dating long-term in a bar?   Not that I'm looking to date anyone long-term, noooooooo (ibid).   Has anyone ever done speed dating? How is the crop of chicks? People actually pay for this crap? Couldn't I just go down to Chinatown and get a rub and tug for 20 bucks? (On a bad night...HEY!)
