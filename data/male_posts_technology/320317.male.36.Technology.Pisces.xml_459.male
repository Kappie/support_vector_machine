Why I think this is quite stupid to even talk about:  If you don't know the difference between all the versions of Windows, then this won't matter to you because you''ll do just fine with all the other versions of Office or Works If you know the difference then your an idiot for running anything less than Windows 2000 Keeping Office to one code base can only be good for everyone (less bugs, more features, more stable, etc...)
