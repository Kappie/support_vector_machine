He said,  "I cannot but reiterate that the long-term stability in the region will also require among other things, durable elimination of political and military tensions between India and Pakistan through the final settlement of the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir in accordance with relevant UN Security Council resolutions."   The Pakistani justification for this adventure was that Kasuri was only following Islamabad's policy of mentioning Kashmir in every speech that a Pakistani diplomat gives in the Council.
