(Next day) Not allowed to chew gum at formation even if I *did* bring enough for everybody.   58. The following words and phrases may not be used in a cadence- Budding sexuality, necrophilia, I hate everyone in this formation and wish they were dead, sexual lubrication, black earth mother, all Marines are latent homosexuals, Tantric yoga, Gotterdammerung, Korean hooker, Eskimo Nell, we've all got jackboots now, slut puppy, or any references to squid.  84. Must not use military vehicles to ‘Squish' things.   87. If the thought of something makes me giggle for longer than 15 seconds, I am to assume that I am not allowed to do it.   94. Crucifixes do not ward off officers, and I should not test that.   100. Claymore mines are not filled with yummy candy, and it is wrong to tell new soldiers that they are.   106. I may not trade my rifle for any of the following: Cigarettes, booze, sexual favors, Kalishnikovs, Soviet Armored vehicles, small children, or bootleg CD’s.   118. Burn pits for classified material are not revel fires - therefore it is wrong to dance naked around them.   132. The loudspeaker system is not a forum to voice my ideas.   145. I should not drink three quarts of blue food coloring before a urine test.   146. Nor should I drink three quarts of red food coloring, and scream during the same.   165. I do not get 'that time of month'.   175. We do not 'charge into battle, naked, like the Celts'.   184. When operating a military vehicle I may *not* attempt something 'I saw in a cartoon'.   195. Shouldn't use Photoshop ® to create incriminating photos of my chain of command.   205. Don't write up false gigs on a HMMWV PMCS. ("Broken clutch pedal", "Number three turbine has frequent flame-outs", "flux capacitor emits loud whine when engaged")
