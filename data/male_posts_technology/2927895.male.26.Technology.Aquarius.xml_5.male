           
      Folks,  When I set out to Chennai this weekend, I thought I would have something really nice to write about.  This was a trip that I'd planned for months on, and when it materialised, I was thrilled as hell.  I took Friday off (rather worked from home) just so that I could go to my parents' place, pick up things that my mom wanted to give my sis, then set out to see Ricky.  She wanted to buy my sis a book, and I thought it was a wonderful gesture, besides it was an opportunity for me to see her as well.  So, despite her office being virtually in the opposite direction, I drove all the way to see her.  She picked up something very thoughtful and nice and I was positive that my sis would be delighted.    I think I had a fight with Ricky when I was with her (I dont even remember now).  I think we did have a fight because when I headed out home, I decided to go to the hairdresser although Ricky wanted me to grow my hair so that she could take me to a hair sylist.  She thinks my hairstyle is horrid and that there is no syle to it.  So, she's been wanting me to grow my hair and she would take me to this sylist that she visited recently.  Anyways, I wanted to defy her and therefore got my hair chopped short as always.  I then drove to the gas station and filled my fuel tank to the brim.  It had 5 litres of petrol already and I ended up filling up another 25 litres, and it cost me a thousand bucks.  Made sure that my tyres had enough air and I drove back home, all excited about the early morning start that I had planned.  Ricky was on the phone with me for an hour or so that night, talking to me about what I should do during the trip and basically being with me during my times of excitement.  I must acknowledge that it must've been awfully difficult for her to talk while her husband was at home but she did manage to spend time with me on the phone.  I asked her if she would give me a wake up call in the morning at 4.  She said she would love to, but was worried that she might not wake up in time to call me and that I would be ticked off because of that.  That spun off into a relatively small fight (some of our fights are big, hurtful and therefore this sounded relatively small).  Despite the fight, she promised to do her best to wake up in the morning and give me a call.    I didn't want to take chances and therefore I kept a wakeup call for myself, woke up by 3.45 itself and got busy getting ready.  4AM went by and so did 4.30 and there was no call from her.  I knew I was going to get pissed and I was fighting my emotions really hard.  I didn't want to ruin the trip and definitely didn't want to spend the next 6 hours, driving in a foul mood.  I'd been planning this trip for months and when it was eventually happening, I didn't want to be pissed.  I love driving my car and I knew that the Blore-Chennai road would be awesome.  So, I pretended like nothing had happened (actually nothing had happened and that was the whole issue.  She hadn't called!!) and went about getting ready.  I finally managed to get out of the house by 4.50AM and I sent her an sms saying that I was setting out now.  I drove to the nearby Citibank ATM, withdrew lots of money and set out from the ATM by 5.05AM.  I took note of the reading on the car, decided to make notes while on the way, and use those notes to update my blog later on.  I have those notes lying in the car right now and I am too lazy to go pick it up.  So, I am going to let this blog be a free flowing one, free of all data points :-)  The weather was pleasant in Blore when I started off, the roads were empty (which is a rare thing in Blore these days), and within a few minutes, my bad mood lifted off and I started to enjoy my driving.  I drove thru J'nagar 4th block, then onto Ashoka Pillar, hit Double Road, then drove past MG Rd, and then finally got onto Old Madras Road.  I started to wonder why it was still called "Old Madras Road" considering that people take this road to get to Chennai.  I started to get a nagging feeling that I might be on the wrong road, and finally couldn't resist the tempatation of waking up Naveen to confirm.  I called him at 5.30 I guess and he mumbled a "hullo" in his sleep.  I asked him if this was the right road, he started to say something but the line got cut.  I waited for him to call back but he didn't.  I figured I shouldn't disturb him once more and decided to continue on the same road.  I prayed a little prayer in my head, hoping that my trip wouldn't be ruined for such a silly reason.  By 5.45AM, the sun started to rise and it was bright enough for me to switch off my headlights.  I noticed that the oncoming vehicles started to switch off their headlights too and that was a big relief for me.  Lights glaring into your eye when you are driving can be very difficult to deal with.  By six, I knew I was really enjoying the drive, I started to increase my speed and was hitting 100 kmph regularly and for good distances.  I was making quick progress and I was beginning to love the feel of the car.  The way it took the curves at that speed was awesome.  I started to think it was the right time to switch on music, so I chose to listen to Yuva.  Yuva is Mani Ratnam's latest movie and the music is composed by AR Rahman.  I can bet on Rahman to belt out amazing music anyday of the year.  So, I started to listen to those numbers and I thought the first two songs were average and then the music started to get worse.  I figured listening to his tunes the first time always feels this way, so I promised to listen to them a few more times to see if I start liking them.  But when I got to the last track (the 6th one), I was in for a pleasant surprise.  This song was titled "Fanaa" and wow, was it good!  It was so catchy that I must've listened to it atleast 5-6 times over and over again and then I started to like the first two songs too...although not as much as the last one.  I dont know what Fanaa means but wow, was that song good!  I was beginning to move my head in tune with the music and I started to clap along with the rhythm of the song.  I realised that I'd been listening to the songs so many times that it was already 8.30AM.  I glanced at my cell to see if there were any missed calls or if there was an sms.  The music was so loud in the car that it was quite possible that I might not have heard the cellphone ring.  But to my dismay, there were none --- no missed calls, no sms msgs either.  I tried to brush it off and told myself that I was doing just fine, I was already 3 hours into my drive and having a good time.  I noticed that I'd done almost 200 kms and I started to think that I could actually reach Chennai soon and my sis would keep me occupied enough to not think of Ricky.  I changed the CD and I started to listen to the NOW collection of songs.  The songs were pleasant, not as catchy as Yuva and I guess I wasn't enjoying them as much because I've listened to them before and was refreshingly new like Yuva.  I realised that I'd been driving for nearly 200 minutes and I hadn't taken a single break.  I also realised that I must've driven past Woody's and I'd completely forgotten about it.  I was enjoying my drive that much!  I was to have breakfast at Woody's but I wasn't really hungry, so I didn't mind not stopping there.    I was probably doing a speed of 105 kmph and one of the songs got over and there was a brief silence in the car, and I heard a loud long drawn sound from outside the car.  It didn't sound like an accident or a big thud, but it sounded like there was siren going off from a nearby factory.  I glanced over to my right but there were no buildings around.  Just lots of trees and open fields.  I glanced at the rear-view mirror to see if the sound was coming from a vehicle from behind me but saw none.  There were no vehicles ahead of me either.  For a moment, I was blank.  Then, it struck me that it could be from my car!!!!!!  I quickly turned off my CD player, turned off the AC, slowed down a bit and rolled down my window pane.  And to my sheer luck, I realised that the loud sound was actually louder (now that I'd rolled down my window pane) and it was indeed from my car!  Bloody hell!  My heart almost stopped and for a minute, I imagined being stranded on this deserted highway, with my car broken down and waiting for hours before I could get a mechanic to my car and get it diagonised, let alone get it fixed.  I almost literally saw my weekend Chennai plans go up in smoke.  I switched on my left indicator, pulled over the car to the side of the road, stopped under a tree, turned off the engine and stepped out of the car to see if there was any visible damage to the car (like smoke bellowing from the hood of the car!).  I didn't see anything wrong on the face of it, I decided to take a quick loo break, pee-ed behind the tree, drank some water and walked around the car, as if that would help the car miraculously work.  Not that I could've opened the hood and started to fix the engine either.  Walking around it was probably the only thing I could do.  I looked up and down the road to see if there was help nearby but saw none.  I ambled to the front of the car again, stepped inside with absolutely no hope, turned the engine on and waited for that sound to come again.  It didn't.  I gingerly shifted to first gear, slowly stepped on the peddle and started to slowly move down the road.  No sound yet.  I kept thinking it was only a matter of time before the sound resurfaced, decided that I wouldn't speed and keep moving slowly till I reached a nearby town where I could show my car to a mechanic.  I kept going slowly, slowly started getting more confident and increased the speed to 40kmph.  Still nothing happened.  I kept that speed for the next 15 minutes or so and then I increased the speed to 60kmph.  Still nothing happened.  I rolled up the windown pane, confident that I could keep this speed and reach the nearby town.  Just when a smile started to appear on my face, I heard the same damn sound again and my heart sank.  I once again pulled over to the side of the road, stopped, but didn't switch off the engine.  I waited for about 2 minutes and I started again and there was no sound.  I kept going and going and you wont believe it, but till I reached Chennai, that sound never resurfaced again.  Phew!  I stopped driving at 100kmph but occasionally touched 80kmph but predominantly maintained my speed at 70kmph.  I guess cutting down on speed started to affect my progress and I started to enjoy my drive that much lesser.  Not that I am a speed-freak but having to consciously drive slower is being unnatural.  Other vehicles were beginning to overtake me, the roads were getting better and wider and I had to actually stick to the left lane so that I could let other vehicles overtake me.  I guess I started to think of other things like Ricky, for example, now that I wasn't really kicked about the drive.  I glanced at the cell and found one sms with a timestamp of 9.30 which said "I fell asleep on the sofa, woke up in the morning and went upstairs to sleep.  I woke up again just now.  So, how's the drive been?"  I was very disappointed with that.  I was disappointed that she didn't call and I was disappointed that it was almost 10 and yet, there was no call from her.  Not being able to get up at 4 to give me a wake up call is one thing but not calling me the moment she woke was even more hurtful.  I tried not to reply, tried to think of other things and continuing with the drive but I just couldn't.  I must've battled with my emotions for over 15 minutes (it seemed like 15 hours!), then couldn't help starting to type a reply back.  I wrote her a nasty sms --- I dont want to quote it online, it was that nasty, and waited for a reply.  I must've waited 10 min or so, and then wrote another nasty sms.  I knew this was going to spin off into a fight but I just couldn't help it.  My mood started to get really, really foul and to make matters worse, I got stuck in a traffic jam!  That gave me the time to exchange a series of angry msgs with her and at the end of it, she became defiant as always and told me that I was an insensitive, mean and nasty guy.  I was hurt, yelled at myself in the car, shouted at the top of my voice telling myself to forget her, get over her and move on.  I yelled so hard that my throat started to hurt and tears started to fill up my eyes.  Luckily, no one could've heard me yelling because the window panes were up, the AC was on and so was the music.    I spoke to her a couple of times on the phone but that didn't help either.  I drove on, hoping that my mood would get better but I started to approach the city (Chennai), the traffic started getting thicker, the weather was getting hotter and none of this was helping.  By the time I got to the city, I was frustrated, angry, bitter, helpless and wanted to get away from everything.  I messaged her saying "Reached the outskirts of the city" and she wrote back excitedly, saying that she was really kicked and happy for her, "although I dont like you".  I felt better because she was excited for me and that lifted my spirits a bit.  I stopped several times to enquire how to get to my sister's house and eventually got there.  She had to rush to some meeting which would last an hour and asked me if it was ok for me to be alone for an hour or so.  I was more than happy to be alone, I wanted the time to sort out my mood and be ok enough to have a good time with my sis.  I had driven 7 hours "door to door" and I didn't want to sound grumpy or distracted and in turn disappoint her.  I knew she had to cancel a number of appointments just so that she could spend time with me.  I HAD to sound better, I HAD to feel better.  She left, I had a bath, changed to fresh clothes and stretched out on the bed.  I must've fallen asleep in seconds and when I woke up, it was 3.30 and I found sister lying down on the carpet in the living room, catching up on sleep herself.  She woke up and we started to talk.  I found a bean bag to sit on and surprisingly enough, found it every comfy.  The bean bag at Ricky's place didn't excite me too much when I was at her place.  Anyways, we started to talk and soon enough, I was telling her about the sorry state that I was in and the difficulties I was facing.  She was supportive as always, told me to give it time, give it my honest best and if I was destined to get Ricky, I would.  She never said even one thing negative about Ricky but only told me that I was entitled to feel jealous or possessive, entitled to be disappointed if she didn't call you at 4, entitled to get angry if she decided to spend time with her husband.  She fully understood my feelings but never a word like "what Ricky is doing to you is wrong", or "I wish Ricky wouldn't be so thoughtless" or "Ricky is mean".  None of that.  I was really touched.    Anyways, we got dressed and decided to drive down to Fisherman's Cove.  The traffic was horrid in the beginning but as we got to the outskirts of the city, it started to get darker, the traffic thinned down and the drive become more enjoyable.  I glanced at the meter and noticed that I'd done nearly 425 kms the same day and wondered how I could still enjoy driving.  Anyways, sis started to tell me about what she was going thru.  I can't put all of that online but when she finished telling her story, I was shattered.  I felt horrid and felt that God was being mean and cruel.  A couple of times, I started to think that I would start crying but fought back my tears and appeared to be supportive just like how she is when I confide in her.  I was really touched to see that my sis was confiding in me but her story made me feel so sad.  I was lost for words and couldn't manage to say anything sensible.  I decided I wouldn't advice her unless I knew what I was talking about, so I just nodded my head most times and listened to her.  I guess she was happy with just that, and she spoke for hours.  I must confess that last night was one of the most depressing nights of my life.  The whole world seemed so cruel and mean.  I started to think of ways to help her but I couldn't think of any.  If the problem was to do with money or something material, I could always help her.  I could give her money, buy her a house or whatever.  But what she was going thru was something that I couldn't help.  I could at best extend a shoulder for her to lean on.  I was mortified and by the end of dinner, I was feeling sick and asked her if we could go home.  She apologised for ruining my evening but I insisted that the evening wasn't really "ruined" but I was feeling bad for her and feeling helpless.  We drove back in silence and stopped on the way to have a fruit juice.  The place was classy and it was a drive-in thing.  So, we sat in the darkness of my car and sipped on our juice.  I had a Mango-Banana smoothie and she had something that I can't seemed to recollect.  We then drove back home, talked for a while and eventually went to sleep at around midnight.  I lay awake on my bed for nearly 2 hours, thinking of all the things that my sis said the evening earlier and felt worse.  I messaged Ricky asking her if she was awake and if we could speak.  Not that I wanted to tell about what my sis was going thru but I just wanted to be comforted and I wanted to speak to her real bad.  I waited for a response and got none.  I realised that her last sms was at around 9 PM and she hadn't even bothered to wish me good night.  I wondered if she was having a nice time with Arjun and she completely forgot about me.  It made me feel pukish and I even contemplated going over to the bathroom.  I then fought my feelings (as always), tried telling myself that she must've fallen asleep --- it sounded so cliched and I knew she wouldn't tell me anything different the next morning but I had nothing better to tell and comfort myself.  It took a while but I eventually fell asleep.  I think this is the most horrid feeling in the world and I pray God that no one...absolutely no one, not even the worst of my enemies, has to go thru this.  Its so sickening that its hard to describe by words.  Horrid!  Horrid!  Horrid!  We woke up late this morning.  She's gone to take GRE classes and should be back in an hour's time.  I thought I'd get online and send a mail to my bosses, letting them know that I would not be coming to work tomorrow either.  I have no enthusiasm left in me, I go thru the motions because I must get on with life but I find life to be so meaningless without Ricky.  Its so painful that it actually hurts deep inside.  When I got online, I found her online on Yahoo and I was thrilled for a brief moment.  She told me that she got online to get download some receipies.  I realised she was probably having a good time with Arjun, cooking for him and enjoying the weekend together.  I asked her if she was cooking for him and she came up with something lame about "trying to get to the kitchen" but it sounded so lame and shallow that I didn't want to believe her.  I hate myself for having to put up with all this.  I hate myself so much....
