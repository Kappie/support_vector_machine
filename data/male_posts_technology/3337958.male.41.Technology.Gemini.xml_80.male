As it stands, I still haven't actually "booked" anything, as I didn't want to be stuck with something that I would've had to've changed because of poor planning.  Since I'll be out of town for the next month, at a remote enough location, and occupied with responsibilies of a  urlLink company  nature most of the time, my net access is likely to be sporadic at best.  I depart this weekend, and am to be back  urlLink here  on the 6th of August.   The plan:   to be in Chicago no later than  Barry's wedding on my birthday , which should have me  arriving between the 8th and 13th   to play a couple of  urlLink dates   on or  about the 22nd of August  to either visit Gock, if Gock is da, and then head south; or if he's not there, go straight to the northern mountains of the great state of Georgia  to stay in A land for a week or so, whichever comes first  Any plans after this are subject to Carola's schedule, or her ablity to be  urlLink there       in the first place.  Anyway, I'll keep you posted.
