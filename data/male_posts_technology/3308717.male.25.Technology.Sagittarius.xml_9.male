These things don't normally bother me since it's usually just one of those things that happens when one wakes up out of some deep mouth-breathing sleep session. I hopped in the shower hoping the steam would revive me. I was wrong.  I ended up calling in sick and stayed home. I poked around on my PC for about an hour laying out the finishing touches for my essay saved that and uploaded it so I could print it later. Then I made it a point to go lay down, at which time I fell back asleep untill around 4pm. I felt like such a bum for it, but oh well that's that.  Maybe I should work a little harder on obtaining a new girlfriend. I had pretty much forsaken relationships for a while when out of nowhere I started seeing this girl, problem was the same thing happened again that had originally forced me to swear off dating. Now I have that itch again. Something deep inside is telling me I should go for it, I should just go out there and get ground into the pavement again. I think it's also telling me I should run with scissors too so I don't really know what to make of it.  Done with that babbling, I picked up "Aqua Teen Hunger Force" season 1 the other day and have thoroughly enjoyed that. I also picked up an old classic,  urlLink "Disgaea: Hour of Darkness"  for the PS2. This game is brilliant and I would reccommend it to anyone, that is... anyone who is into brilliant games. If you aren't, well, this one isn't for you... go play Poke`mon or something.  At first this may seem like some sugar coated cutesy game, but as you play it the story really developes into some twisted shit. Let's just explain a few things you play as  urlLink Laharl , a psychotic and dimented kid and only son of Krichevskoy the king of the Netherworld. Basically, you are a demon prince. Your direct subordinate is a little cutesy demoness named  urlLink Etna , though she is loyal to you, she sometimes freaks out and has temper tantrums. You're goal in this game is to basically overthrow this guy that has taken control of your, now deceiced, father's kingdom and destroy everyone in your way.     -intX    do a little dance...
