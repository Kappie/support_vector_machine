People were upset because they thought this banner was an advertisment sponsored by the City. In fact, it was not.  The airplane banner appears to be yet another attempt by the residents living in Quail Ridge, Rookery Woods and River Valley to stop the landfill cleanup and redevelopment project at Adams and Hamlin Roads.  I can assure you that no city tax dollars were spent on this airplane ad.
