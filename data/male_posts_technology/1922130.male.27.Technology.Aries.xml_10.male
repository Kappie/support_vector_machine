It was like watching a  moth try to fly in a straight line during a hurricane.....I have new respect for batters who can hit the knuckleball.  Fortunately the Sox won, but I didn't stay awake for the end of the game.  The Cubs beat the Marlins last night to the tune of 12-3 shellacking.  It's funny, I rarely watch baseball during the regular season, I'll check out a few innings here and there and check the scores and standings online from time to time, but when October rolls around I love to watch (or at least fall asleep to) the postseason series.  Last night during the game the announcers mentioned an online poll that asked if dynasties were good for baseball.  The result (not surprisingly, since a ton of Yankee fans were watching the game) was that dynasties are good for baseball.  Generally, I disagree. I like to see new teams in the post season each year, except for the Braves who should make the playoffs every season.  Oh, and the Braves pitching dynasty of the mid to late ninties was a great dynasty for baseball.    On the football half of life, the fantasy team went 2-0 this weekend (I told you I had good matchups this week) for the first time.   So now I'm 4 and 6 with a bullet.    The diet I'm on is working as expected, I'm dropping water and am down about 7 pounds in like 3 days.  Alison is a loser because she is no longer on the diet with me.  She says she still is, but she's eating cereal and PB ....not on the plan.  So poo poo on her.  We watched "A Mighty Wind" Monday night.  Christopher Guest delivers another solid, witty performance both on screen and off, though I don't think it quite compares to "Best in Show."  Don't laugh but I think I'm gonna try to buy the soundtrack to the movie.  A lot of the folk music is hokie, yet somehow it mesmerizes me.  And almost all the music was performed AND written by the actors, which is definitely unique.  Two thumbs up for the film.
