When I got to work the shocker came that my immediate manager Dave has announced his retirement.  I immediately talked with my co-worker and let her know I was interested in taking his place.  I didn't want to appear to climb over her.  She said, "That's fine, I don't want it."  I then sent an email to my director and had a little talk.  For starters I'll get some of Dave's projects and then we'll see.  Gene, the director, says he's interested in starting a technical services group to manager storage, large systems (unix) and small systems (windows).  I hope I can become a leader to manager this group.  so far this has been a good move for me.  I'm keeping my mouth shut when I need to and speak when I need to.  So far so good.  The painters are painting my house this week.  Pat is finishing some of his handiman projects I'm contracting him for.  Nick is bored.  I don't know what to really do, other than counsel him to call his friends.  I can get him a ride to his friends house if he likes.
