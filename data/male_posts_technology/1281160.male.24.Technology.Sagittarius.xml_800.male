Its language is simple but embedded with lines from German, might b french or latin and even Sanskrit too. He seems to be Erudite scholar. And without any paprphrase its really really tough to understand him i believe. Anyway i am making attempts to further bury down to the meaning behind those mystic lines!   Oh atlast tomorrow its going to end and i havent read other chapters for the past few days. Will have a look or read and then post my comments there!  Kaanavillai: Valli y what happened? bye for now
