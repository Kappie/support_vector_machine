So now I actually know how to do it, but I'm not satisfied yet, becouase I have to build the Crystal Reports first, and they are kinda static... I need more dynamic reports, so more research will have to be done on the subject...  But it was actually very easy to produce PDFs from a Crystal Report, confusingly easy! :)  But I still like the whole XSL-T style of the Java FOP... ;)
