I tape areas, paint, then let it dry for 2 days before i can do it again.   Its slow going.  I found out today at work I have to go back to Germany twice in september.  I have tickets for a pixies concert in mid september, (seeing the pixies play is on my life to do list), of course,  manager man wants me to skip it.      HAHAHAHAA i say.  Not a chance, sucker.   So now I will be flying back to texas to see the show, then getting back on a plane (20 hour travel day) to go back to work.  You know what? It's worth it. Some things you just have to stand your ground on.
