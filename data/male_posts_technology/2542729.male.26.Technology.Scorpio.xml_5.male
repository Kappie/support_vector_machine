Seems like a pretty descent chill site...game room...standard military storefront type outlets...the lil internet machine (that uses dialup) so best you can/ should do is check your email cause for a dollar for 5 mins, you don't have much time to lolligag. I didn't really get anything that day. Thought about getting a haircut but one of my homeboys cut it the next day as part of a favor for me fixing up his computer. I ended up giving him my last 64 meg stick to speed his joint up....only ended up charging him 20 bones. Normally I charge more for my services, especially for a reformat/ clean install but my man is essentially broke so I tried to work with him. Plus he cool anyway...when he wants to be. After all that, changed clothes  went to the gym to get right on some boys. I was running pretty descently the first two games, rebounding, shooting arite, playing solid defense...but not having played since middle of last began to show the 3rd game. Brother was stuggling to make plays lol. I think I played in 4 or 5 games overall. I know the last two games combined, I only had 1 basket  (elected to play defense  rebound...let somebody else run up n down the court!)  So all that was day two in a nutshell.  Day three opened up the flood gates of anguish!!! Our whole purpose for being there was to get all the paperwork outta the way so when we return in Feb, all we have to do is train. Well, today was the big MEDICAL EVAL!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUGGGGGGGH!!!!!!!!! SHOTS!!! SHOTS!!! SHOTS!!!!! My man had me scared outta my shoes for a while (NCOIC)...the way he put it pretty blunt when he was like if they found anything wrong with us, we'd basically be no-go's  sent back home, released from duty. I tell you this...I did not get this far just to be turned around! And thank God I wasn't. Everything was arite...except the fact that I needed  SIX  shots! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH HHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And I was sore, so it was like AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGG GGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!! Also met this kat who was a medical alibi  victim of a crappy company commander. Apparently, he was hurt and the military has basically crapped on his every attempt to get the treatment he needs. He is a prime example of why I hate this country sometimes. To uncle sam, if you're not healthy, you're a liability. You're a number, in a sea of many, and that's not the way it should be. I wish the best for him  his wife. I hope they weather this storm and come thru alright. Later that night, I was also able to send my baby Nikki an email letting her know that I was okay. Couldn't stay in that room too long tho. Its hot  cramped...far from what I understand a true 'internet cafe' to be.  More adventures to come! Stay tuned!!
