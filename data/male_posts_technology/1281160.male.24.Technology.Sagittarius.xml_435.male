(IT) and after spending more than a year in this course, itâ€™s not the time to feel bad abt your mistakesâ€¦ha haâ€¦so think accordingly and try to find a good Koli who can offer a job for usâ€¦(just kiddingâ€¦but this is the fact tooâ€¦oooh!huh!)  BTW...I wish u all a "Happpy Ganesh Chaturthi". May Lord Ganesh Bless u all.
