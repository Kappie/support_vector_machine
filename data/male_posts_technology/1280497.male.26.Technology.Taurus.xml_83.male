Julie did a great job delivering him; she was glad to have the epidural, though she did well through the contractions that came before she was admitted to the hospital.  He has hair on his head! Julie and I were convinced he would be bald, but when he came out (and when they had cleaned the slime off his head), it was apparent that he indeed does have little tufts of hair, especially on the sides of his head.  Before he was born, I wondered what he would look like. Despite it being a cliche, once I saw him I realized that he looks just like what he should look like. That could be a function of the adaptation of my expectations immediately upon seeing him, but it just seems like he could not look any differently from what he looks like!  What a strange, awesome experience. He has been sleeping and eating and pooing ever since he was born. He happens to be sleeping right now. When he's hungry, he opens his mouth and twists around, as if there were a breast right there all the time, waiting for him to get hungry...Julie might contend, on second thought, that there  is  a breast (two, in fact) waiting for him to get hungry.
