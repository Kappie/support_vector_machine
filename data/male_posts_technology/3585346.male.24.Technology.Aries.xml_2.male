July will be a busy month for my new job and studies. Gotta put in some effort on it.  Meet buddy and Vernon on the way home and damn upper changi road east the road was fugging JAM up cause of a long trailer accident. Made and U turn and saw vernon's "VIPERED" car. Woohoo. But entire day I been drooling at at least 5 evos on the road.....It's a dream....but I want this dream come true! Most definitely!  Waiting for big tv and refrigerator at Adrian and Jen house tomorrow and can slack all day long!
