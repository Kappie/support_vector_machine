I never had a run of good cards and as we neared the end, I never was fortunate enough to catch when it was time to try to defend to stay in the tourney.  On UB  Party both tourneys I finished 4th, one spot from the $$, On PS I made it to the final table each time, since the SnG's I play there are 2 table, but ended 6th  7th, with cash at the 4th spot.  Although my first day was less than spectacular, I basically played what I thought was good cards, remained patient as long as I could and didn't overplay hands and get caught.  I was able to make a few blind steals in position and never played a weak or suspect hand out of position.  I'm sure I'll catch this up when the cards turn but it gets frustrating sometimes waiting for that ot happen.  It should also be noted that I didn't play these tournies back to back.  I played 2 after coming home from work, ate dinner, helped my sister-in-law try to buy a car, and then played 2 more.  Tomorrow is another day!
