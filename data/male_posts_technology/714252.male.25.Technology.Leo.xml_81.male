I just had one of those annoying customers that know enough about computers to double guess and query every single thing I was asking him to do.. Then he would go off on this long boring rant about some obscure bug in XP (which wasn't even the operating system he was using..) Damn fewl kept me on the phone MUCH longer than was healthy..  Anywho.. back to tonights proceedings.. Meeting OP at my place for a drink or two while I get ready for Salsa tonight.. If anyone reading this is going to Salsa tonight, hit on his friend Ciara, it will REALLY get on Nats nerves ;P  Looking forward to my class tonight, I was so bored last night that I actually considered trying to learn some steps off the Salsa video.. (I hate trying to learn things from a video.. Seems pointless to me.) Hopefully Vivienne will be teaching the class tonight buit who knows (actually Carmel did a really good class a few weeks ago too.. hmmmm)  OK, I am definitly starting to wibble... Think I'll wander off and have a look at bubbles blog to see what mayhem he is causing.. wanna see if he put up anything about his parents reaction to the site :) He showed it to them last night :-o  OK, you can bugger off now :)
