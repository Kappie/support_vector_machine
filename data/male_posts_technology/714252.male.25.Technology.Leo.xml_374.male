I amn't a fan of Bill Gates (I don't have any problems with him either) but then out of the blue I read that someone that a lot of the people think of as the epitomy of Capitalisms bad side has set up a trust that "Together with the British-based Wellcome Trust, which holds assets worth around £9bn, the foundation leads the world in charitable giving."  It's mad really.  Anyway, I promise a rant sometime soon.
