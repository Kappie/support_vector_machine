I first heard it a few years back listening to Robert Miles "In the Mix". I recently discovered that it was part of the movie soundtrack for Les Amants Criminels as well. This François Ozon movie is a French modern day retelling of the classic Hansel and Grettel. Until recently I was unable to make some connection between the movie and the tale but now all has been revealed.    Now I want to talk about the song but let me give you a plot rundown (spoilers). The story starts off with two "lovers", Alice and Luc. We learn very early on that this is no ordinary relationship as Alice is very manipulative and Luc is very shy (sexually). Alice takes full advantage of this weakness.   Alice begins to tell Luc about a boy at school Saïd who wants to have sex with her at school after a wrestling match. Saïd is very excited to actually get  invited  by Alice to have this encounter as it was not his idea. Luc, loving Alice gets jealous of Saïd and after being told of his desire to pursue Alice, goes with her to the gym to kill him before they have sex. Out of love he kills Saïd, a guy that Alice simply does not like.   Alice and Luc flee, all begins happy. They clean up and take the body for disposal and end up in the woods after the car breaks down.   While they are in the woods they discover the house of a hermit, L'homme de forêt. The two notice he has left to hunt so they run in to get food. During the theft they are caught as he returns. Both are captured and locked in a cellar.   L'homme de forêt takes a liking to the boy and agrees to feed him meet,basically in return for bathing and sexual favors. On the side little does he know that the "fattening" with the meat is so that in the end L'homme de forêt can eat him. Another little side note is that the meat is of Saïd...caught your interest?   The predicament leads to eventual escape, death, and love.   So how does this tie into the song? Eventually Luc discovers that Alice lied to him about Saïd. His feelings were so strong that he killed to prove his love. He knew that sexually he could not give her what she wanted or needed.   Now re-read the song...how many time can you say " could we stay right here till the end of time until the earth stops turning wanna love you until the seas run dry I've found the one I've waited for"  As people we have this desire to love and be loved. In many cases we will do what we can to prove that to our companion. Luc did just that. He loved her and it could be said that in return she loved him back. Having Luc murder Saïd could have been Alice's way of making Luc feel strong, like the lover he could not be.  In the end Luc witnesses and participates in the murder of innocent Saïd, the death of another, and finally the start of a true love that he cannot have.  Fairy tales can be closer to real life than many think and sometimes it takes modern interpretations of stories before we can realize that we may be doing similar things. It takes a "What the Fuck" before we step back and realize that sacrificing is fine but putting yourself in jeopardy to prove love is stupid and in the end a waste of energy.
