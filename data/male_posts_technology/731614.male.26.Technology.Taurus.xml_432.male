I also wanted to say that I am very distraught at the loss of our lone pure redhead.  I guess she must have discovered my dirty little secret.  mike, thanks for the good times in the hot tub.  quick x-mas in june list:  * unique pez dispenser(s) * supply of fun dip * all flavors of big league chew * invader zim wristband * water balloons
