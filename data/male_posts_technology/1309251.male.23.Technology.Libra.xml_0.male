How did  I really remember about this one? Why should I remember about this one? The difference between the status of my first and only blog and the present one is,that,I was jobless and had a lot of time to browse about blogger.com.  Now,I have the same free time ,but with a job of more responsibilities and less work.I can blog for hours without being disturbed.  I am still waiting for a high point in my life to occur,because,I can't see myself sitting in front of the computer doing nothing.I am thinking for a job change ,but in a software company as a programmer.Even that requires sitting in front of the computer for longer hours than now.But,I will be paid better and atleast won 't get bored.  I will get my head tonsured ,if,I could get a pay 4 times my present pay.
