Dogs and cats come from pounds and come from "free to a good home" ads.  You have the RIGHT not to dissect! Stand up for yourself and the animals and choose to refuse!  Take action! - Find out today if you have to dissect. - Let your teacher know, politely and in writing, that you will not be dissecting because you believe that dissection is cruel. Offer suggestions for alternatives, like computer simulations and models. - PETA's got your back: call or e-mail if you need help finding alternatives or just the right words to say. - Use these stickers to get the word out. (which i am...lol)  You're not alone. Thousands have refused to dissect. Who likes to dissect? "In 9th gade, in biology class, we had the usual dissection of fetal pigs, and i took the remains of that home, and kept the skeleton of it, an di started branching out to dogs and cats." said infamous serial killer and cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer. Yikes! Get an A in science without the usual slice and dice. Choose to refuse, and don't settle for an F. Nobody has to die for you to get good grades. It's your right.  Yours truley,   The Frendly Anti-Dissection Brigade at PETA"  Brought to you by the People for the Eating of Tasty Animals, lol.
