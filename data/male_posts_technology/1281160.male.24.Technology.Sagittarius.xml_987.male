Yes, i wanted to take srini by surprise that night and so planned on 31st Dec afternoon to get some gifts for him.  ya, dint know what to buy as usual and so, planned to pay a visit to Gangarams book shop.  Actually Srini wanted to read Bharathiyar Kavithaigal and so i thought it would be better to gift him a book he had loved to read once.     But to my dismay, they said there wont be any Tamil books at Gangarams. My friend was supposed to join me over there for shopping. So while waiting there, slowly i browsed thru' the greeting card section of theirs. In the front panel i searched and searched and could not find even a single new year card for husband. i was getting still more irritated. But then suddenly when i was onlooking some post cards, i found some beautiful and exquisite post card pictures of Indian sculptures and temples. yes they were awesome and i was so impressed. Then i remembered that Srini wanted to make an album of such things. So stat, i bought some postcards and picked a beautiful album too for that. Decided, let me gift this album of cards for him!  Then when i went inside to other panels i could see so many new year cards, but dint buy any, coz i thought one of the post card was much better than those cards! So planned to convey my wish thru' that simple postcard!   Then my friend, she came and took me to higginbothams and to my joy, there i found the book i had wanted to gift to Srini! Yes, now i got book and an album for him. To add sweetness to the day, i bought some rosagullas @ K.C. Das    When i came home after shopping, i found Srini sitting at home hungry and angry?! since i dint inform where i had gone. Then i told i had been out for shopping. then we were chatting and rang to almost all his acquaintances and wished them. At dawn of new year, at 12 MN, we went upstairs to see the splendid crackers display in shivering cold weather at Leela Palace and gifted him my presents.    Think he liked! both book and album! Next day got his blessings and as usual went to office and  in the evening went to Domlur Perumal temple and wished for his blessings! Good did the first day of the year end.   I planned to take 2 resolutions, one was to practice dance and music daily for sometime in the morning which i am not able to do till date. The other one is to improve my reading habits, which i think i am doing regulalry.   On Saturday we went to ISKCON temple. Its was Ekadasi. In the entrance they had put a beautiful swing decorated with flowers and had laid the Ananda Sayanam(sleeping pose) of Lord vishnu with his mistress besides. The whole entrance was painted in gold and it was so splendid and serene to go under the foot of Lord at the entrance.    Spent almost a day there, since it was fully packed. But then since, they had very well organised, we dint feel the pain of waiting. Then in the evening went to Leela Palace, did little bit of bowling, but to my dismay i could not even touch even a single pin how so ever i bowl.  So did the first week of the year end with pleasant events and happenings. This how was my new year!
