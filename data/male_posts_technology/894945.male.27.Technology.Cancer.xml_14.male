Dirty, sweating thrusting and plenty of screaming and moaning. Is it really possible to get two different things from the same woman? Or in Alex's case, the same lumberjack?  Oh, and one more thing. I had links to two other sites because I liked them and wanted a link back. I emailed both guys twice and never got a response. So from now on i'll only be linking to sites that I really like or ones that link back. I am not going to share my readers (both of them) with anyone.
