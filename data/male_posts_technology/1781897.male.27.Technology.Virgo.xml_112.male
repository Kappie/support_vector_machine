She was moving swiftly and was just about to get to the other side of the crossing...  Meanwhile, this MASSIVE SUV drove up wanting to make a right hand turn onto the street the woman was crossing. This guy had the balls to come to a rolling stop and couldn't wait for the woman to get all the way across and went out into the middle of the intersection to get around her while she was crossing.  To the self-important prick who would rather get to where he was going ten seconds faster than wait for a pregnant woman to finish crossing the street: BEATDOWN.
