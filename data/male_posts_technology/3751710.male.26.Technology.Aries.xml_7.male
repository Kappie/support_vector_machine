But, to Cody, Jayson, Christian and me, playing cards is much more.  It is a test of strength, stamina and endurance.  Some people have their so-called ``marathons,'' ``gym memberships,'' and `` urlLink extreme challenges .''  But, these activities quickly become dull and boring.  Last night (er this morning) the four of us started our 3rd game of  urlLink Spades .  We began around 2:45 AM.  We then played some of the worst spades ever.  Five hours late, at 7:45 AM, Cody and I  finally  emerged victorious...    At their request, and because I have these rare inexplicable moments of nerdity, I plotted our  urlLink scores .  Please, enjoy.   urlLink
