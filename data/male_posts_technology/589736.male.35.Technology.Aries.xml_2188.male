Jane Harman, D-Calif., who added that some of the images were of male prisoners masturbating. She said she saw a man hitting himself against a wall as though to knock himself unconscious.    Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., said he did not see acts of violence, but what appeared to be ``results of acts of violence.''    He said he saw people in body bags and a person with a face ``virtually gone.'' He saw ``people being stitched up above the eyebrow apparently unconscious.''    Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., said, ``There were people who were forced to have sex with each other.''    Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., said, ``There were some pictures where it looked like a prisoner was sodomizing himself'' with an object. He said blood was visible in the photograph.    But House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said he thought ``some people are overreacting.''    ``The people who are against the war are using this to their political ends,'' he said.
