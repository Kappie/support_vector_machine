(The first 5 minutes were actually pretty fun, just like playing in the snow as a little kid. 15 minutes later, when the snow plow came by and plowed me back in... was less fun.) Classes are still out, though they should be starting again soon.  Snow also postponed the other big task I've been working on, which is interviewing candidates for the Targum Marketing Director for next year. Oh well. I guess there's not much you can do when your carefully laid plans are upset by the textbook definition of an "act of God."
