       Waves of pain, stomach 

    

     

 

 

 I can vaugely remember having bad stomach pains around 8:40 am this morning but I was only half awake, thankfully.  I do remember having nightmares.  I have just risen from bed at 11:25 am although I've been awake for some time.  I have a little belching as usual. 

 There is a banana upstairs with my name on it. Half before I shower and half sometime after.  Maybe I'll try that soy yogurt today, and I hope to make another recipe from my book today.  I wanted to make one yesterday, but the pasta salad lasted all day.
