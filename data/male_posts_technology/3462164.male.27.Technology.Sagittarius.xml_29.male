Fred Barnes of the Weekly Standard made a very good point, the same Democrats who are so angry about our "atrocities" will be the first ones to point fingers after the next terrorist attack on US soil. They will ask why we didn't do a better job gathering intelligence, and when people point out that they are the ones who prevented the CIA from doing its job, they'll say we're questioning their patriotism. Not that they have any, but that's another story.                 Here's my take on the whole situation. First of all, let's be real here. We probably are torturing some prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. But it would be wrong to equate our actions to that of these savages who behead innocent civilians in Iraq and Saudi Arabia. They torture people for fun, we torture only as a last resort in order to gather information. If a prisoner has valuable information that could save American lives, and he isn't talking, then we should do whatever it takes to make him talk. Remember, these people are our enemies. They have raised arms against America, and now they have to pay the price. The savages claim that they are retaliating against us because of US treatment of Iraqi prisoners. That's ridiculous. Long before these pictures were released, these cowards were resorting to cowardly tactics such as suicide bombing in order to attack coalition troops and Iraqi civilians. Furthermore, as far as Iraqi prisoner abuse is concerned, none of the pictures are showing torture. They show degradation and humiliation, which is not the same. This isn't just semantics here either, it is an important difference. And the accusations that our troops are insulting Arab culture are pretty weak, considering that Arab culture doesn't have any problem with rape, honor killings, torture, and other acts of savagery. The Geneva Accords don't apply to the Iraqi prisoners, as they haven't been classified as prisoners of war. I'm tired of seeing our enemies violate the rules of war everyday, and then hiding behind them when it's convenient. Now I'm not suggesting that we lower ourselves to their level, but we do need to make it clear that they can't get away with attacks on civilians, and then expect us to treat them with respect.
