So, without further ado:   Chapter One: Enter the Newlings   As the weekend draws to a close, I can't help but wonder what tomorrow will bring... The  Powers That Be  have finally decided that the manpower shortage in  Mass Storage Area One  has gone on long enough, what with one man (yours truly) handling  Incoming , another tending to  Outgoing , and 2 incapacitated  Labourers  (there's another story there, I assure you).   So, for the first time in many months, the company coffers are being pried open and we're going to be seeing fresh blood in the ranks. Yes sir, they've gone over the resumes, held the interviews, and made the callbacks. What we have now are qualified individuals, highly experienced in their fields, and ready to help the team. All that remains is to make them forget everything they know and show them how to do it all our way...  Tomorrow will be interesting, indeed.
