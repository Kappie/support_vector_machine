Oh well, I just went to bed listening to  Sense Field - Save Yourself :  My self esteem, it's been low, go ahead and count it's been lower than low. / I know the feeling of it stealing life out from under me. / I want to learn, can you save yourself for someone who, loves you for you? / So many times we just give it away to someone who, couldn't even remember your name / Could you save yourself for someone who, loves you for you, loves me for me? / Give it away to someone who, someone who will cherish your name.   Hmm... speaking of music, I think I'll post some songs that I've been listening to / sing / humming / mumbling all day.  1.  AFI - This Time Imperfect    I cannot leave here.  I cannot stay. Forever haunted, more than afraid. Asphyxiate on words I would say. I'm drawn to a blackened sky as I turn blue.  There are no flowers, no, not this time. There will be no angels gracing the lines, just these stark words I find. I'd show a smile but I'm too weak. I'd share with you, could I only speak, just how much this hurts me.  I cannot stay here.  I cannot leave. Just like all I loved, I'm make-believe. Imagined heart, I disappear. Seems no one will appear here and make me real.  There are no flowers, no, not this time. There will be no angels gracing the lines, just these stark words I find. I'd show a smile but I'm too weak.   I'd share with you, could I speak, just how much this hurts me. I'd tell you how it haunts me.   Cuts through my day and sinks into my dreams. You don't care that it haunts me.  There are no flowers, no, not this time. There will be no angels gracing the lines, just these stark words I find. I'd show a smile but I'm too weak. I'd share with you, could I only speak, just how much this hurts me... just how much this hurts me...  just how much you...   2. the second half of  Drive Emerson - Only God (Could Stop Me Loving You)  (the beginning has some raunchy stuff in it)   Only God could stop me loving you Only God could tell me not to He sent you from heaven Just to make my dreams come true When he opened the door That you came walking through Only God could stop me loving you  There ain't no girl In the whole wide world Could tear us apart And there ain't no man Could steal your hand And tear us apart  But there is one God, In heaven above who gave me love strong enough, to calm my heart  Only God could stop me loving you Only God could tell me not to Only God could stop me loving you Only God could tell me not to Only God could stop me loving you   3. This one I heard on the radio three times today... kinda spoke to me, but I don't believe it in this case :|  Brooks Garth - Unanswered Prayers    Just the other night a hometown football game My wife and I ran into my old high school flame And as I introduced them the past came back to me And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be  She was the one that I'd wanted for all times And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then I'd never ask for anything again  Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers  She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams And I could tell that time had changed me In her eyes too it seemed We tried to talk about the old days There wasn't much we could recall I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all  And as she walked away and I looked at my wife And then and there I thanked the good Lord For the gifts in my life  Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers  Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs That just because he may not answer doesn't mean he don't care Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers  Some of God's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered... Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers
