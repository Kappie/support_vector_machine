It's really a tough situation because, as  urlLink I've said before , I don't hate the work I do or the people I work with, I hate the bureaucratic crap that comes along with it.  Like a stupid ass VP of Technology who sneaks around looking over people's shoulders making sure they're not surfing the web and making sure they're in the office at the appropriate times.  You don't ever see him actually  doing  it, but then about once a month, word comes down that he's observed people not adhering to the rules.  What a bunch of crap.  My superior (otherwise known as my boss, but I hate when people call their superior/supervisor "boss", it makes them sounds like they're under their control) breaks the news and even agrees that it's stupid, and as he puts it we're all professionals and he judges us by our productivity and output, not by what he catches us with on our screen, which is the way it should be.  And this stupid ass VP, he won't even tell the offenders directly.  He sends word out through the grapevine, which really only makes people think he's more of an ass.  All it really does is make me more careful.  I still do whatever the hell I want to.  To be honest, whenever I'm goofing off, I really do feel guilty, because I  am  a professional with a good work ethic.  But when this once a month comes around, I always make sure to be a little less productive, just to spite the bureaucracy.  I could either spend 15 minutes online doing who knows what, then getting down to business.  Or I could be pissed off and sneak around a few times a day, then zone out and daydream, then think about the stupid senior staff who seem to forget about what it was like to be regular once they achieve their lofty positions.  So really all the big brother stuff is quite effective, as you can probably tell.  Especially since I'm writing this at 11:00 am on a Friday.  You do the math.  Another way I justify my goofing of is that I'm not a smoker who spends 15 every two hours outside.  I'm not a social butterfly who flutters around the office talking to people all day.  I don't yap on the phone all day long.  And also,  urlLink I don't get as much time off as I should , and at that I don't ever use up all my sick days.  So I figure I'm entitled to some brainless web surfing time.  Anyone know of a company that's hiring?  That is, a company that values their people and productivity over their appearances?
