I figured I can emphasise different area of what I learned in the following 3 ways and also considering the space constraints. Can't practice bokken work in my room either, too cramped.  I'd usually do it in the living room. If the weather was warmer, I'm thinking of laying some cover in the backyard and workout from there. Fresh atir in UK is very shiok. I heard that during the summer, Pauline Sensei sometimes conducts classes out on the grass. I've seen some camps where they do move out into a huge field to train. Though I'm not sure how dirty the gi at the end of classes.  In Singapore, I also can't be swinging my bokken around like a maniac lah. Parents will kill me first and I don't think any amount of Aikido can save me then. Usually I'd try to wake up early to practice in the carpark. Sometimes the neighbours will see me and they probably think I'm some kind of a maniac wielding the bokken around like nobody's business. Hah... but it's ok lah, coz private carpark, the public can't see me. Just one or two person catch a glimpse I can just ignore.  At home in UK, I've already scratched a bit of the ceilings and walls during bokken practice. Hope they won't ask me to pay for repainting. Heh heh, then again I might shift some furniture around just to hide the scratches and marks.  Sensei mentioned that Chiba Sensei will be dropping by and staying over at her place for a night sometime around end of April. I'm wondering if I will get to see him face to face and in real life. Wah, a bit scary to face a traditional Japanese Sensei, man.
