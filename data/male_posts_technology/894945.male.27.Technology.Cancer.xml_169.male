Last Friday myself and Dougal's brother, Brett, headed to a house party, the Battle of Flowers Moonlight Parade, and finally Zebra Square. Our mission? To be photographed with as many quality ladies as possible in one night.   Review the evidence by clicking  urlLink here.  Then send me a  urlLink email  with your vote, and a nickname for Brett!
