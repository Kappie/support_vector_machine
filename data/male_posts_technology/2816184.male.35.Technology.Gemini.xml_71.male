Nicely done? **annoyed as all get out ** I ordered a demon to shoot a teacher and a student - I kicked a mortal in the head - or didn't you hear the crash in the symphony? -  I am so wiped out by trying to stop my allies from getting their asses kicked because we were seriously outnumbered most of the time... caught the attention of one of the scariest evil Gods - luckily placated him for the time being - because no-one on this side of the game offered any assitance and Blandane doubted my trustworthiness because the only thing willing to help me out was a demon who had originally wanted to kick my ass and shit down my throat to quote her.... and to top it off I picked up a note of dissonance because I skirted the truth - which I intend to fix, but the truth is so UNBELIEVABLE that I'll probably get my teaching job  taken away and sent to the Aberdeen Home for the Insane....and there is no way I want to be caged with those blood suckers.   Now there's a huge mess and if Ms. Trent blabs how the hell do I explain why Miss. Anderson shot her on MY ORDERS? Again it's another situation where the truth is unbelievable and if I skirt the big issues again I'll probably end up falling.  (Pick up a rock and chuck it into the ocean) *huff*
