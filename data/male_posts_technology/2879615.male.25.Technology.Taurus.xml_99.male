I ran my ass off like a jackass once again...it ended with ME bussing a table and slipping on spilt burr, legs and arms FLYING and creamer ERRRRWHERE. ALL over me. I was lactating. As I'm leaving, Yast and Craaaaig call me and tell me they're coming in for growlers. COOL POINTS 1 and 2! So we're hanging out at Triumph (THE GREATEST PLACE TO EAT DRINK AND WORK)and Pat, love of my life Pat gives me his full IPA beer which I sneakily chug (PRAY i don't get fired).  So Craaaaig finishes his burger and MA again tries to throw it in the butt. LOVE YOU.  hahaha To top it all off, Guarino gives me the coolest songs ever to work on over break. I start my new job @ OTB tomorrow, but TONIGHT we are polishing off growlers of Amber and Helles, living like CHAMPIONS!!!! LOVE THE LIFE I LEAD.  I now have direction, thank you Craig M.  Here's to getting high like the first time and having life changing conversations. Much love and many many kisses.  Autumn, its only the beginning of a new chapter. Love you.  PEACE HONKEYS I'M GETTING DRUNK  smash u TABULOUS!
