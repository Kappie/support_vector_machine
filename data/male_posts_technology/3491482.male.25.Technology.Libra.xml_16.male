The question of whether respondents have a case is never addressed, since our tort system favors deeper pockets, and almost all of the respondents choose to settle for a few thousand dollars rather than take on a huge and well-funded opponent in a legal battle that could cost hundreds of thousands.    The RIAA maintain that file-sharing is theft.  However, the legal definition of theft is based on depriving an injured party of access or enjoyment of something they would otherwise have had.  In perhaps 99.9% of the files swapped, the receiving party would never have purchased the file they received, even if they were somehow aware of the product and had a channel for buying it.  In a surprising number of cases, people receiving the file become aware of new music they like, and go buy a product they otherwise would have had no knowledge of.  So file sharing really only fits the legal definition of theft when someone receives a file that they would otherwise have paid for and fails to follow up with a purchase.  File sharing is therefore sometimes a curious sort of contingent theft, at worst, and a free advertising channel at best.
