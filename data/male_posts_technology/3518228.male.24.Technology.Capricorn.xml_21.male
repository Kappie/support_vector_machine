I went from being child-phobic to having two young step children.  I'm meeting with my Professor on Thursday.  We've got to decide on what classes I'll be taking, and start familiarizing me with the model (CANOPY) that I'll be working on.  I think that I'm going to be adding a light model similar to that of SORTIE.  Beyond that, I'd like to extend the model to understand that the world is not flat.  Also, if I haven't worked myself into the ground by then, I'd like to add the capability to consider UV exposure profiles in the modeling.  Just like with my research at work, I'm wondering how anyone expects to get accurate data about outdoor phenomena without considering the weather.  Now, we can't predict the weather into the future, but being able to enter UV profiles as input would probably help a lot WRT calibrating the model.  I think.  I -really- need to get myself up to speed on the biological basis of this process.
