She really liked the otters and the bears.  Karissa wanted to see the tigers and they did not have any I cannot tell you disappointed she was but she told me she was going to get a tiger someday because I told her tigers were her daddy’s favorite.  Well I saved the day I found a stuffed baby tiger in the gift shop for her.  This is her stuffed animal of the day now.  It had a tiger striped leash or whatever that I bought as well.    We then went and met my friend Tara for lunch I have not seen Tara since shortly after Lisa and I met.  Karissa liked Tara a lot.  Tara invited us over for Dinner.  Karissa and I stopped at Mcdonalds on the way home.  I let her play in the play area for probably 90 minutes.  She was having a real good time.    Went to Tara’s and we had spaghetti for dinner and watched Harry Potter.  Tara’s son had a couple of Hamsters and now Karissa wants a couple.  Karissa fell asleep on the way home in the car.
