A beautiful island of hope and joy in a sea of pounding work.    Just a few more miles separate me, the wearied dessert traveler, from the refreshing waters of my weekend oasis. Of course weekends present me with their own little conundrums but it’s a rather pleasant task to choose between sleeping, playing Rise of Nations, watching a movie or visiting brigade road (yet again).    There is one thing which bother me though. I haven’t been able to come up with a weekend project. I installed a shower in my loo the last weekend but the newness is kind of wearing off and I need a new project for this weekend.    Ughhhh… this whole doing something with my life thing is kind of getting to me. But truthfully speaking I do feel rather proud of myself when I do manage to complete something.    Hmmm….. strange but I suddenly feel an inspiration coming along…………..      Aaaahhhhh  how I love weekends.
