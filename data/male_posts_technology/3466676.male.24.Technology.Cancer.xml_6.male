Their job, in a nutshell, is to figure out when we are going to run out of oil and to raise awareness of the issue (or impending doom, depending on how you look at it).  According to them, the world will reach it's peak of oil production between 2008 and 2010.  Then the oil output will slowly fall until there is nothing left.  Estimates range from 50 years from now to hundreds of years from now before we actually run dry.  If oil starts to cost $200 per barrel because of the low supply, are the most powerful countries of the world going to pay that?  I would guess that they are going to "Shock and Awe" those prices down to a more reasonable level.  By that I mean they are going to carpet bomb the oil producing countries into submission and take control.  The big problem with finding an alternative to oil is funding.  Oil, today is worth mountains of money and the people in control of it are very rich and powerful.  These rich and powerful people are not going to support technology that makes them redundant.  I might even venture that some of the larger oil companies are powerful enough to stifle innovation to prevent viable alternatives from appearing.  One can argue that the car companies are now making hybrid vehicles that get previously unheard of gas mileage and they are doing their part.  When I see a car dealership, I see one or two hybrid cars and a hundred V8 gas guzzling SUVs.  The car companies are not soley responsible for this, they make what the consumer demands.  The  urlLink site  is definately worth a look if you are curious about the future.   Disclaimer:   I drive a giant boat of a car with a V8 that gets worse gas milage than should be legally allowed, but it is sure fun to drive.
