I'll sleep on my left. No, that doesn't work either. I'll read my book, a chapter or two. No, that didin't work. I'll listen to some relaxing music. Nope, that didn't help either. I'll go and get a drink of water. That was nice. I want some more water now. I can't sleep.  Let's have a moan about something. The music in our common room. First of all, nobody is really listening to it. When the hi-fi is taken away, everybody does what they always do which is chat. So even with music as loud as possible, everybody still chats; but the music is often so loud I can't hear myself think. Problem number two, the music that is played is shit. There is no other word that defines it, it just really is. Continus beats and some strange person talking over the top of it. So when the radio is put on rather than somebodies nasty CD, it's Kiss 100, which is also shit. Not as shit as some of the CDs people bring in, but still pretty shit. How about Radio 1? That plays music all day long that everybody will like. No? Alright, Capital FM? Too much pop? Alright, try Virgin. Not a chance; bunch of selfish bastards. Wait until the lower sixth become upper sixth, then we'll show 'em.  A thought has just come into my head. There are no real swear words. Let me explain; shit means poo, piss means just that, fuck means to plant a seed, wanker means to do that naughty thing boys do, bitch means female dog, bastard means your parents arn't married, prick means something sharp and pointy. There are no proper swear words! Even my own alternative, cabbages, means a green vegetable thing. I say we event a word that is purley for cursing with, a proper swear word. It has to be an all purpose word though, so it has to fit in the asterisks in the following: "**** off", "You stupid ******", "That's a load of ****", "Britney is such a *****", "I hate Justin, he's such a *******". So, all purpose, generaly insulting word; can't think of one, I'll try and go to sleep, I'm sure I'll think of something.
