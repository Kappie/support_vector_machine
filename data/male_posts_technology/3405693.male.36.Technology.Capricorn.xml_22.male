And then tonite right after work I must drive out to New Westminster for some recording.  I'm stoked about it, except I just hope I have the energy to kick ass.  As I said...I'm tired.  Got a job offer yesterday...sort of.  It's a company who I had turned down an offer from about 18 months ago.  Now I remember why I turned them down: they seem reluctant to take any accountability for my income.  Purely commission outside sales just doesn't appeal to me all that much.  They have presented it in such a way that it allows me to keep my already part time job pretty much the same as it is now tho, so I may say yes.  I figure it can't hurt, except for loss of some free time which I don't particularly need right now anyways.  If I can make a bit of cash I come out ahead.  If I don't dig it, it's easy to quit.  So I'll quit the job at fido with the racist boss which only gives me 8 hours a month (much as I enjoy that job and that company, I can't stay in the location I'm in anyways).  And set some hours ground rules at LD and then kickus bootayus selling b2b wireless data solutions.  Or fail miserably.  Whichever.  Man it's hard to think coherently when you're this tired...day off tomorrow thank christ...
