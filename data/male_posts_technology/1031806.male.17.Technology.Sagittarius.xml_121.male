Let me preclude this by saying that these last 12 months have been the most stressful in my entire life. Bearing that in mind, I can begin to see just how radically different my mannerisms… no, my personality was affected. All the tension and pressure was constantly building up at home, growing greater and greater every day… I felt with every turn of the second hand on the clock I was being crushed… enveloped in despair, entwined in regret, torn between conflicts of my conscience and my love for both my parents, warranted or not, it was there to stay. Crushing, crushing, always crushing, never letting up, compressing my being into a tiny ego incapable of feeling emotion because of some self-inflicted wall that I put up that kept me from getting close to anyone. Through all of this, school was my only constant… my only vent… and how did I vent all this emotional stress? By closing myself up and pulling back from all around me, of course. I was a walking, living, breathing, pile of depressed flesh… nothing more. Trouble was, I had become VERY good at hiding it over the years, and to a person that did not know me exceedingly well, I was fine. I was wallowing through school (or lack there of… I didn’t try at all the entire year: barely squeaking by with a GPA for the year of 3.14) for the first several months until around November or something when I started to get to know Gwen better… To this day I still can’t remember who started going out of their way to spend more time with the other and get to know them, but I’m fairly sure it was her, being as my emotional state and corresponding people skills were hovering very slightly above that of a rock’s. Man, she’s been such a blessing to life in more ways than I will probably ever know. Whether she knows it or not, she was the one person who was able to break through my massive facade, that huge false pretense that all was well with me, and start to brighten my life. It wasn’t like it was a drastic change all at once: no, it was more a gradual breaking away from that impersonal shell that I felt acted as a shield to me. In the latter months right before school ended, this resulted in me acting openly depressed and hard to live with (annoying and such)… something I’m not proud of… but I guess that’s what it took to break me out of the bleak barrier that I was cowering under. As I said before, God’s really blessed me with her, and I’ve never really communicated that to her. I love her with all my heart, but I still have a ton of lingering interpersonal issue that prevent me from telling her how I really feel about her, no matter how much my heart yearns for me too… I want to scream my love for her, but I guess this blog is the closest I’ll be able to come to that for a while… I guess through all the suffering and tribulation I’ve been going through does have a purpose, though I certainly can’t see it no matter how far ahead I strain to peer into the far reaches of time and find that more and more, I have to rely on God.  Ok, this post was really random, and prolly doesn’t flow well… Summary: I love Gwen and I’ve never told her how much of an impact she’s had on my life in the last several months.
