I couldn't understand most of the words in the "post" but it seemed to be something to do with medical stuffs.   Well, now I'm waiting for cliff to get home so we can play video games or something.  I started reading "The last unicorn" today. The jury is still out on this one. It gets right to the subject right away, which is good, but.... I don't know.  Anyway, I got asked to work saturday today, so I have to decide if I'm gonna do that. (Notice: if you want to do something on saturday, tell me tonight, otherwise I'll probably work) I said I'd find out tonight and get back to my boss tomorrow. It's a fun job that I'm enjoying, I just don't know if I can work 13 days straight.  It's especially difficult when I don't get to bed before midnight....
