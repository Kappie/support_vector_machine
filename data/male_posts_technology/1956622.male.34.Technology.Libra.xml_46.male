She said "can I give you a hug and kiss and hang up?" so I could not say no.  I felt bad for her so I did just that.    I spent the first part of my morning doing homework which I finished about noon.  Other then that I spent the day cutting down some tree branches that were rubbing up against the house.  Then I spent about 4 hours in the 90+ degree heat leveling the yard for the pool I have for Karissa.  It is about 12 feet around 3 feet tall and holds about 1500 gallons.  It just finished filling and is a little lopsided but not too bad considering I did all the leveling by hand.  I think I had too much sun I am actually feeling kind of sick but I am happy the pool is up.  Now it just needs chlorine and it got some grass in it but that will be easy enough to fix.  Tonight will be a early to bed night I have to get up and go to court mandated parenting class for a good portion of my morning tomorrow.  Then I have to see if I can get a bunch of stuff out of the back yard (wood and fencing) and take it to the dump.  That way the yard can be nice and clean for Karissa when she gets here.
