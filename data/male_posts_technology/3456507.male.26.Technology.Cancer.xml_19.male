That's what happened after the Microsoft chairman realized the potential of the Internet. And it may happen again if he starts his personal Web log.   Yes, the world's richest man may start his own blog, one of those online diaries that have been the rage among techies for the past three or four years.   Bill's blog won't be all business, either. He's expected to share personal details such as tidbits from recent vacations, according to tech pundit Mary Jo Foley's Microsoft Watch newsletter. Citing unnamed sources, she reported yesterday that Gates is about to start blogging "real soon now."   Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray would not confirm the story, but left open the possibility, saying, "Bill would love to do his own blog at some point in the future, time permitting."
