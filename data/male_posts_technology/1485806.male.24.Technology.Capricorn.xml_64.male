I will not tell u guys who is in the cast ..but allow the pics to do it for me.  This is another true story of the values that revolves around football..Yes i like to watch movies that have strong values and it is all instilled in football movies except for the infamous Waterboy which is a crap show.  Remember the Titans, Replacement Players, ..follows the same line as this movie.   This story revolves around a passionate football coach who have started to train and move the town's team into victory and targeting the state finals....Radio, a slow and retarded youth who often pushed his trolley into the town and around the field where Coach Jones is training his boys..Coach befriended James which later is dubbed Radio, simply because James had a passion for radios, which he carries everywherer he goes. Coach Jones helps Radio by allowing him to help out in the football team and later when the season ends, he helps in the basketball team.in school... Through the  years, we get to see how Coach Jones develops a strong relationship with Radio and how Coach Jones fought for him and helped him... The true spirit of discipling is often seen here and Radio exhibits a very kind and forgiving heart that treats everybody the same no matter what they do to him.   A Very Recommended Movie besides Passion.
