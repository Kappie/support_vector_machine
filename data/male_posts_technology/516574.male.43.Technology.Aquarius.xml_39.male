	 
       If you had to choose:    1. Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly?  Gene Kelly, because I once stole as much of my freestyle dance moves from him as I was once physically capable of...  2. The Great Gatsby or The Sun Also Rises?  Never read either, sorry...  3. Count Basie or Duke Ellington?  Gotta pick Duke for the intricacy of some of his arrangements, although it's a close call in terms of piano technique...  4. Cats or dogs?  Was a dog guy pre-marriage, cat guy since, and my spouse J is still pushing for a new puppy...  5. Matisse or Picasso?  Picasso (although Matisse ain't chopped liver...)  6. Yeats or Eliot?  Eliot by a hair; I do like the more apocalyptic bits of Yeats...  7. Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin?  I gotta go with Keaton for sheer balls-to-the-wall physical comedy, but  The Dictator  and  Modern Times  have their moments...  8. Flannery O'Connor or John Updike?  Since I know I've read O'Connor (and can't place anything I've read by Updike), that gets the nod...  9. To Have and Have Not or Casablanca?  Casablanca by the same logic as #8...  10. Jackson Pollock or Willem de Kooning?  Oh hell, this is a close call -- Pollock by a paint droplet...  11. The Who or the Stones?  early Who over early Stones, but for total career (and my final answer): Stones...  12. Philip Larkin or Sylvia Plath?  (aarrgghh!) Split decision...  13. Trollope or Dickens?  Dickens, because I have no idea who Trollope is...  14. Billie Holiday or Ella Fitzgerald?  Neither, I'm afraid -- I respect their respective skills, but I don't feel any visceral connection to their recordings...  15. Dostoyevsky or Tolstoy?  My Russian Lit skills aren't refined enough to distinguish the two...  16. The Moviegoer or The End of the Affair?  I saw a few minutes of the latter film, but not enough to give an informed answer...  17. George Balanchine or Martha Graham?  You know, if it isn't Fosse, I generally can't tell...  18. Hot dogs or hamburgers?  Tend to prefer hot dogs...  19. Letterman or Leno?  Letterman by a margin wider than the gap in his teeth...  20. Wilco or Cat Power?  More acquainted with Cat Power, so there's my choice...  21. Verdi or Wagner?  Even though I'm nigh unto pathologically averse to opera, I'll go with Wagner here...  22. Grace Kelly or Marilyn Monroe?  Marilyn...  23. Bill Monroe or Johnny Cash?  Johnny (but I like Bill too...)  24. Kingsley or Martin Amis?  Who?...  25. Robert Mitchum or Marlon Brando?  Mitchum...   26. Mark Morris or Twyla Tharp?  Despite what I said in #17, I know and like most of what I've seen of Tharp...  27. Vermeer or Rembrandt?  Calling this a tie, since I can't mentally pull up a single picture from memory that I *know* is by one or the other...  28. Tchaikovsky or Chopin?  Chopin easily (Did I tell you I think Thelonious Monk was the reincarnation of Chopin? Did I? Huh?...)  29. Red wine or white?  Prefer red (but white works sometimes too...)  30. NoÃ«l Coward or Oscar Wilde?  Wilde (but only just...)  31. Grosse Pointe Blank or High Fidelity?  I watched Grosse Point all the way through; I couldn't do the same with Fidelity...  32. Shostakovich or Prokofiev?  I tend to lean toward Shostakovich...  33. Mikhail Baryshnikov or Rudolf Nureyev?  Baryshnikov...  34. Constable or Turner?  ?...  35. The Searchers or Rio Bravo?  Rio Bravo...  36. Comedy or tragedy?  Comedy...  37. Fall or spring?  Summer...  38. Manet or Monet?  Minnie Mouse...  39. The Sopranos or The Simpsons?  Simpsons...  40. Rodgers and Hart or Gershwin and Gershwin?  The Gershwin boys...  41. Joseph Conrad or Henry James?  Neither, actually...  42. Sunset or sunrise?  Sunset (if I'm up at sunrise, I'm not a happy camper...)  43. Johnny Mercer or Cole Porter?  Johnny Mercer (close, though...)  44. Mac or PC?  PC...  45. New York or Los Angeles?  Only barely been to either, but I think LA is more my speed...  46. Partisan Review or Horizon?  No clue...  47. Stax or Motown?  I can almost certainly name more Motown tunes, but I also know I love the Stax sound, so Stax gets the vote here...  48. Van Gogh or Gauguin?  Very close call to Van Gogh...  49. Steely Dan or Elvis Costello?  I imagine that if I reached for a random recording of one or the other, I would be more likely satisfied by something from the Steely Dan stack than the Costello stack, but I also think if I had to choose between my favorite recording of each, I'd go with Elvis, which is what I'm doing here...  50. Reading a blog or reading a magazine?  Well, I do both pretty dernded frequently...  51. John Gielgud or Laurence Olivier?  Gielgud, entirely on the strength of  Arthur ...  52. Only the Lonely or Songs for Swingin' Lovers?  No preference...  53. Chinatown or Bonnie and Clyde?  Chinatown...  54. Ghost World or Election?  Only seen a few minutes of each, but Election looks like the kind of movie I hate, and Ghost World like the kind I don't...  55. Minimalism or conceptual art?  Dead heat...  56. Daffy Duck or Bugs Bunny?  Bugs...  57. Modernism or postmodernism?  Postmod...  58. Batman or Spider-Man?  Batman...  59. Emmylou Harris or Lucinda Williams?  Close call to Emmylou...  60. Johnson or Boswell?  Not a fan of either...  61. Jane Austen or Virginia Woolf?  Woolf, but only just...  62. The Honeymooners or The Dick Van Dyke Show?  Slight edge to Van Dyke...  63. An Eames chair or a Noguchi table?  No clue again...  64. Out of the Past or Double Indemnity?  I know Double Indemnity and not the other, so there you go...  65. The Marriage of Figaro or Don Giovanni?  Didn't I already say I was *pathologically* averse to opera?...  66. Blue or green?  I once spray-painted my tennis shoes green. That answer yer question?...  67. A Midsummer Night's Dream or As You Like It?  Not inclined one way or the other...  68. Ballet or opera?  (gak!) My two least favorite art forms tangentially related to music (yes, I said opera is *tangentially* related to music -- I'm in a bad mood now, okay?...) -- given the forced choice, I'd rather go to a ballet; I could then close my eyes and pretend it's a concert...  69. Film or live theater?  I'm inclined to go with film; the only advantage that immediately comes to mind with live theater is that the audience generally doesn't talk all the way through it (at least in my experience...)  70. Acoustic or electric?  Sorry, my ideal is mixing the two...  71. North by Northwest or Vertigo?  Vertigo...  72. Sargent or Whistler?  Not enough background to say...  73. V.S. Naipaul or Milan Kundera?  (see above...)  74. The Music Man or Oklahoma?  Music Man  75. Sushi, yes or no?   *HELL*  no...  76. The New Yorker under Ross or Shawn?  Not a consumer of the New Yorker...  77. Tennessee Williams or Edward Albee?  Williams...  78. The Portrait of a Lady or The Wings of the Dove?  Portrait of a Lady (by the thinnest of margins...)  79. Paul Taylor or Merce Cunningham?  Merce (because of the John Cage connection...)  80. Frank Lloyd Wright or Mies van der Rohe?  Wright...  81. Diana Krall or Norah Jones?  Krall by a landslide...  82. Watercolor or pastel?  Watercolor...  83. Bus or subway?  Bus (being mildly claustrophobic...)  84. Stravinsky or Schoenberg?  (hate forced choice, hate forced choice, hate, hate, hate...) Can't choose...  85. Crunchy or smooth peanut butter?  Smooth...  86. Willa Cather or Theodore Dreiser?  Cather (only just...)  87. Schubert or Mozart?  Mozart (no question...)  88. The Fifties or the Twenties?  Gotta pick  Happy Days  over  The Untouchables ...  89. Huckleberry Finn or Moby-Dick?  Finn (that whale story is one tough read, dude!...)  90. Thomas Mann or James Joyce?  Joyce (of course, so is  Ulysses ...)  91. Lester Young or Coleman Hawkins?  Hawkins by a hemi-demi-semi quaver...  92. Emily Dickinson or Walt Whitman?  Whitman...  93. Abraham Lincoln or Winston Churchill?  Lincoln (we share a birthdate, you see...)  94. Liz Phair or Aimee Mann?  Liz (but I like Aimee too...)  95. Italian or French cooking?  Italian (but not by much...)  96. Bach on piano or harpsichord?  Hate to commit apostasy, but I prefer piano...  97. Anchovies, yes or no?  Prefer no (but I will eat them, nonetheless...)  98. Short novels or long ones?  Short (I have the attention span of a... ooh, look, shiny!...)  99. Swing or bebop?  Bebop (although most swing is good, too...)  100. "The Last Judgment" or "The Last Supper"?  I'd rather have supper than judgment, thank you...  And so my  urlLink Teachout Cultural Concurrence Index  score (number of choice A's picked divided by number of questions where either A or B was picked) =  .50 !
