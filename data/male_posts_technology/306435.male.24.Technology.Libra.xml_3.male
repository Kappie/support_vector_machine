My friend Chris Burke plays shortstop for the Michigan Battlecats, the single A team for the Houston Astros.  Any way, we got up there around 5ish.  My mom, dad, sister Kelly, and brothers Colin and Matthew were all there.  We got in the building and found the entire Schulte family, and a ton of Burkes.  the game wa a scheduled double header.  In the minor leagues double headers are shortened to two seven inning games instead of the ususal nine.  Before the game I was a little anxious.  I am not sure why I played on the same team with him from third grade to my senior year in high school.  I always prided myself on not being someone who got intimidated by him.  When I saw him on the field I was impressed.  He looked like he belonged.  This is what he was meant to do.  he came over to here his family and friends were gathered.  I was up on the seond level, just sort of watching.  I didn't want to be one of the people who went running...that isn't pro. The cool thing was he looked up and found ne right away and yelled, "Hey what up Ryno!"  That was when I remembered that he wasn't the man, myth, and legend...he was my friend Chris.  He went off to stretch.  I watched the first game from a multitude of seats.  Dayton sells out every game so tickets were hard to come by.  Chris got hit with the first pitch of the game, he had a bunt single, a sac bunt, and then popped up.  As the teams took their thirty minute break, the clouds rolled in and so came the rain.  The rain chased most of the crowd away.  The Schultes left and the rest of us took seats behind the first base line.  I got to talk with everyone.  Mojo (Chris's mom) told us all sorts of stories.  We talked about the College World Series, signing day, being in the Astros locker room.  She also said that Chris does not have a computer...can you believe that?  The rain finally stopped.  By the end of the second game (I believe Chris 1-3 with a double and intentional walk that drew boos from our section of the stands) it was like we were in Louisville at a St. Matthews field.  Mr. Burke was hilarius.  The San Diego Chicken was at the first game, but the second game we witnessed the exploits of Roof Man.  Mr Burke started the "Jump!" chant.  My dad danced to Funk Soul Brother...and we pondered the how a man can not advance, but get a hit and an error on the same play...(it will hurt you if you thik about it too much).  The Battlecats won and remained a half game ahead in the standings.  Chris came out after the game.  I walked down with my brothers and he came right to me...he thanked me for coming and shook my hand.  Someone else (family I think) grabbed his attention..I started to walk away and he yelled "Ryno thanks for coming...I mean that".  while my brothers find it funny that I am Ryno to him...I found it cool that with all this hoopla that has been surrounding him, he went out of his way to say good-bye.    On the way back to Cincy my sister and I discussed the hitsof the day on the radio.  On the way up we heard "because I got High" by AfroMan.  It is quite the amusing song.  we also discussed the mulletts we saw during the day.  Dayton was very homogenius.  In fact I think I could count the non-white people I saw who were not int he game on one hand.  Tomorrow we are having Tom's 21st birthday party.  It should be fun...if not stressful.  Evidiently Tom is threatening to move bunnies to Chicago, or something...I am not sure.  You need to check out his page to find out.  His link is on my links page.  I say this because I am too tired to type out the html code to link you there directly right now.  Okay...that is all I have for now...I didn't get to see Ann today...so I need to work on that tomorrow..until then...
