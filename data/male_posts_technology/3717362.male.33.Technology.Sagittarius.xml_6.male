The Lightning will be holding a viewing party down at the Ice Palace the night before the DVD goes on sale.  Lord Stanley's hardware will be in attendance, too.  Might have to go check that out!  Speaking of the Cup, I keep hearing about random appearances at various local bars.  In one instance, a friend from work was there.  Not being a barfly myself, I'm bummin'!  Any REAL friend of mine better call me if the Cup shows up wherever there at!!
