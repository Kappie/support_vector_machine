It was probably my very first 'sane' fourth, where I didn't get burned or stabbed with a PVC pipe (recalling last year when i nearly chopped my toe off with a pipe...)  At first I didn't think that I was going to do anything for the fourth, seeing as how I had/have no money, and that my parent's weren't home.  But then the neighbors got home and bought explosives and we had fun.  So today I'm going to go and take the driving test for my license (sp?).  I should do okay.  And then (the best part) we're going down to the Apple store and letting me see the pretty Macs.  I can't wait, it's gonna be sweet.    Random bits: I'm over 1000 posts @ BB in about 3 months.  Also, check  urlLink this  out, it's from  urlLink SRF.STN .  Funny as hell.  peace out :)
