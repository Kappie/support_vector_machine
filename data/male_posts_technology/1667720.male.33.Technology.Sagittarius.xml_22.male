First of all, I attributed yesterday's successful run to proper fueling. Instead of my usual carb intake of ~20 grams (can you atkins?), I increased my intake by a factor of 2 thinking the extra carbs would likely not kick me out of  urlLink ketosis  and would probably aid my speed work. Based on my split times and how I felt during the run, I think my theory was right. So what went wrong?   This morning as I prepared for my morning run I started scavaging around the kitchen looking for a good source of carbs. Unfortunately the  urlLink nutrition fairy  has not come around lately and all I found to eat was a urlLink  lean cuisine lasagna . apparently this is not the perfect food to consume 20 mins before a run. It just sat there in the bottom of my stomach like so kind of pasta brick. Ug.      I think I'm gonna buy some  urlLink Cytomax  before this happens again.
