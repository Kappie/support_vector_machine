At least not the fun stuff.   So do I have a problem with motorcycles? Yes two. Boy (I was one once) let their hormones get ahead of their commons cents.  The other problem I have is that they are COOL! Since they re cool, people riding them donâ€™t wear protective gear and responsible clothing. Why? Because their Cool image maybe tarnished.  My wife drives a motorcycle. She wears a helmet, gloves, long pants, and over the ankle boots. I think she does a really good job of balancing cool with responsible. What about you?
