Not that I've set foot in a classroom or anything like that, but that's the only it's going to get done.  I've spent a big chunk of today trying to write my term paper (due in 3 days... love to procrastinate) for my arts literature and music class. It's regarding the Baroque architecture of Christopher Wren and Francesco Borromini. Hey, wake up... you've only read the topic.. you're not the one sitting here trying to find something interesting to write about it. I just finished a quiz for the same class... Got them all right... that was a relief... After taking the quiz I decided to look over the term paper requirements one more time (just for kicks I guess...) and what I had originally remembered saying 10-12 pages in length was only 5-8 pages. That makes my life a whole lot easier. I guess my other class this quarter that required a term paper had 10-12 pages... and I only wrote 6 or 7 for that... I'm not overly concerned though. I really only need a B in my classes... my company reimburses me 100% if I get an A or B... that's incentive enough.. I don't need to spend $3000 of my own money just for school. Of course, defining "my own money" is interesting enough... Originally that money was just $1200. Thank Montgomery for the G.I. Bill. I never thought I was going to use it.... Eh... boring writing here too. Not that it matters how boring this is... nobody is reading it. I'll probably come back to this at the end of the year and delete it... Maybe I'll write something more interesting some day.
