This is what one friend wrote about me:  Tim - a guy with too much free time who writes descriptions of his friends that are so honest he might lose some of them after his memoirs get published.  he gets pissed when you spell it "dood."  he likes to talk, and his form of humor is to repeat the same jokes over and over.  he's anal about being on time, spelling, and about maintaining friendships. he's always up for drinking and having a good time.
