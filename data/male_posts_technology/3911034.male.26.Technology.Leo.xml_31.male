The Griffith boys barely had a team with the majority of their regulars back home in Norway for the holidays. After a couple dodgy goals the Gold Coast Knights went into the break 2nil but didn't look too convincing. Griffith came out in the second half a lot stronger but the Knights got another goal, 3nil. The show wasn't over with Griffith coming back with a couple quick goals, 3-2. After a couple of missed opportunities for Griffith to level the score the Knights scored another to put the game out of reach of Griffith.
