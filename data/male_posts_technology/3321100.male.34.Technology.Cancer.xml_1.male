Not agressive like she said, but indifferent, like someone who wait a disaster to born again like a phenix (What's the name of the dumbledore's phenix ? Fumseck no?). So I had a verry good job, a nice house, a nice car, a big motorcycle, a 130 cm TV, a lot of computer, a nice wife. My life is so boring than I dream to break it all to rebuild something different. Stupid little boy I am, He want to break all his toys... I'm waiting this little spark who can help me.... Wait again wolkam...Wait  WAKE UP !!!!!! DAMNED !!!!!!
