I was in pain all the way home, and the leg is still corked now. That's all 6' 5" and 92kg of him below.           2. Found out I can't go to NZ for the tournament in June because of visa issues.  3. Realised the ticket was booked under special fare so it will cost heaps to re-book, might actually be worth just doing a no-show.  4. Missed a training session with  Danny Green  on Wednesday.  5. Didn't get paid on Friday like I was supposed to (great timing, I have $9 in the bank) so I had to call my dad to bail me out.  6. Withdrew money from an ATM on Saturday and had a seriously torn $20 note dispensed, even Maccas wouldn't take it!  Apart from all the above was having to sit through public transport which was just rooted. It consistently took half an hour extra just to get anywhere, and considering the amount of travel I do... well, you do the math.  Plus, I had the displeasure of breaking the news to Shihan about not being able to go to NZ. You could see the disappointment in his eyes, so much so that I'm probably more disappointed about him being disappointed than I am about missing out on the tournament.  Oh well, I live to fight another day - quite literally in this case.
