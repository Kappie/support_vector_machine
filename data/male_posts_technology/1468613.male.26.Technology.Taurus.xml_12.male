Just rantings from the SARS household - you might come back and the whole place will have quarantine tape all around it and they will be serving food to us through the letter box, dressed in big white suits (you know the chemical ones). OK - so I may exaggerate. Carrie has been so lovely to me - helping me with much needed healing soup and teaching me the art of toasted marshmallows in between chocolate coated digestives, not to mention all the hugs.  In between the sniffles, snotty tissues and coughing fits it has been welcome relief. Mum popped over bringing flowers - which she assures me smell very nice - hopefully the cold will clear before they die.  She also brought much needed food and immediately took on the dishes after arriving - just so we could make some more! Apart from that I am trying to complete my uni assignments so I don't have anything to worry about when I leave - only 15 days now - and 16 until I see you!!!!!!!!! Anyway - must go and find some more tissues. Hope things are going well - let us know soon!!!!! Take Care Love Always Kai
