He actually wrote a book about a guy wanting to kill Bush - and he doesn't even bother an attempt at trying to veil it!!! It seems to me He's just some left wing wacko trying to entertain his fantasy in plain view - by thinly disguising his own desires as fiction.  (and rubbing it in everyone's faces) But I'm sure he expects this kind of response as a selling point.
