So, I spouted obscenities to the computer and I'm typing it again.   I found this quote in the margins of my psychology book.   "I contend that nature has given males the heaviest burden of all: the burden of always having to Make the First Move, and thereby risk getting Shot Down. I don't know WHY males get stuck with this burden, but it's true throughout the animal kingdom.... It's always the male bird who does the courting dance, making a total moron of himself, while the female bird just stands there, looking aloof, thinking about what she's going to tell her girlfriends. ('And then he hopped around on one foot! Like I'm supposed to be impressed by THAT!')"  Acutally, in some species, it is NOT the males birds that have to do the song and dance. But in biology, there are always exceptions.
