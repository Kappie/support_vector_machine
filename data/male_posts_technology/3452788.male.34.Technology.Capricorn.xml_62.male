Was he a great president, or a great American?  Well, I guess the Russians never blew us up, so there's one in his favor.  But we later found out that all that time, all that energy, all that money was wasted, because all we had to do was wait for the Soviet Union to fall apart.  Maybe wasted is not the right word - the military made a great comeback, supported by running up a big deficit that I am now paying for.  Schools went in the tank, the environment took a back seat, too many adventures in foreign policy (gunboat diplomacy), the resulting resentment against Americans worldwide that continues to this day, ... yeah, thanks, Ronnie.  Instant Karma my ass.  John Lennon died, but Reagan lived, when both were shot.  Just think how different things might be if those results were reversed.
