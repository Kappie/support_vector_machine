Don't do that other stuff anymore :P Well work has been busy...really busy. Heck, I'm happy. Dang, this evening I was one weak F!@%#. I got off work and fell asleep. When I woke, I went down to the corral and fed the animals. I was all being tough and *UGGH* "what happened to me strength?" So I spent more time down there than the usual time I spend there. I guess that's the disadvantage of work being really busy, oh well. I was reading/skimming ExxonMobil's overview...this is how it is exactly written.  **********  OVERVIEW OF THE MCU/RU FIELD AREA OPERATIONS   The ExxonMobil owned and operated properties in the McElmo Creek and Ratherford field areas are located in southeastern San Juan County, Utah near the towns of Aneth and Montezuma Creek. The BLM and Navajo Nation have jurisdiction over producing operations. The Navajo EPA and Region 9 Federal EPA have jurisdiction over environmental concerns.  The Ratherford Area has facilities that are under secondary oil recovery, through the use of water injection to extract additional hyrdocarbons. The MeElmo Creek Area has facilities that are under tertiary oil recovery, through the use of Carbon Dioxide injection to recover additional hydrocarbons. Tertiary recovery involves the injection of both water and carbon dioxide (CO2) into the production reservoir. This is generally done on an as needed basis at injection pressure of approximately 3000 psig.  At present McElmo Creek has approximately 173 producing and 127 injection wells currently operating. The Ratherford approximately 97 producing and 74 injection wells currently operating. McElmo Creek and Ratherford total production currently stands at:  	10,000 barrels of crude per day 	12,000 standard cubic ft gas per day 	36,000 barrels of producing water per day  Facilities in the McElmo Creek and Ratherford Area include:  	(2) Water Injection Plant 	(6) Production Tank Batteries 	(20) Production Test Satellites  The facilities are used to separate the produced fluids (gas, carbon dioxide, water, and oil) meter and measure qualities and quantities, and then either transfer or sell the production.  The hydrogen sulfide (H2S) concentration in the McElmo Creek and Ratherford Area Operations casinghead gas varies from approximately 80 to 3,000 ppm. H2S concentrations will be higher at all tank battery crude storage tanks and production satellites. Area where the H2S concentration is greater than 10 ppm (OSHA action level) are posted with warning signs.  The production office for the McElmo Creek and Ratherford area is located: 1.5 miles northwest of the Aneth Mustang on highway 262 then 3 miles North on the McElmo Creek Injection Plant lease road. ********** Umm, "Yeah, OK." The company I work for just got fined 5.5 million dollars. Dumb@sses. There's an article of it in The Navajo Times and in our local newspaper, The San Juan Record. Goes something like this...  **********   Multi-million settlement reached over oil spills on Utah Navajo lands   SAN FRANCISCO - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday announced a settlement with Mobil Exploration and Producing U.S. Inc. for spills from its oil production activities on the Navajo Nation in southeastern Utah.  The $5.5 million settlement includes a $515,000 penalty and requires the company to spend about $4.7 million on field operation improvements to reduce spill incidences, according to a press release from the U.S. EPA.  Mobil will spend approximately $327,000 on environmental projects that include sanitation facilities and construction of a drinking water supply line extensions that will provide running water to 17 residences located on the oil production fields.  Currently, local residents may drive as long as an hour to fill 55-gallon drums with drinking water.  In March 1998, the EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit claiming that between December 1991 and March 1999 approximately 83 spills at Mobil's oil fields reached tributaries of the San Juan River - a violation of the federal Clean Water Act.  Mobil's oil production fields are located on both sides of the San Juan River in southeast Utah on lands leased from the Navajo Nation.  The EPA worked closely with the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency in addressing the spills, which the Navajo Nation EPA first brought to the EPA's attention in 1996.  ********** All I can say is Wow. I'm actually one of the few that are working out in the field improving facilities and locations. Mainly replacing old flow lines, all types of valves, and what not. I guess I could say I'm doing a good thing for my community :P Wish they could do something about the pollution in the air though. The air we breath is sickening at times.  Well just thought I'd post all this crap...since I have nothing better to do at the moment.
