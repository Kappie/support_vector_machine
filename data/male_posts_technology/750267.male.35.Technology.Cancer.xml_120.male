But when you're in the midst of a bad experience with an airline, one bad experience is as bad as another.  Basically, the latter half of my flight was delayed  four hours  for no good reason as far as I can determine. What's makes the problem several orders of magnitude worse, is that I was actually sitting on the damn plane for those four hours. I've written to American Airlines to get some sort of an apology. We'll see if they respond.  My flight to Aruba was slightly delayed as well. Basically, someone in business class found some suspicious papers in their seat pocket. The plane was delayed an hour while airline security determined if it was a threat or not. Apparently, some diplomat accidentally left some important documents. They probably weren't even threatening documents, just something with a U.S. goverment "top secret" seal on them. Geez.
