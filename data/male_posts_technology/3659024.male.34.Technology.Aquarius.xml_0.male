I am sure all my colleagues think I am in sane, I sit here groaning and sighing, cheering (not too loudly) at every chance missed and foul, every close call.  I don't follow football all the time (rugby's my game) but this is England, my home my land. I don't know how can explain it any better. I am sure others love their homeland too, but there seams to be something about England that green and pleasant land. An Englishmans belief that God lives there, that almost certain knowledge that whatever happens England will be there.  I know many who might read this will no doubt disagree or even cuss at me. But these last fifty years something has remained dormant, sleeping but if it ever awakes then the world I fear will be shocked. English nationalism.... Many think England a spent force, an empire in decline or gone.  When the English awake, with dreams of empire, then all should worry, all should tremble, for these peace loving English can still bring to bear that mighty sword, bringing down all, be it Hilter, be it Neolpeoan .... England did bring them low in their hour of victory.   I know the above may be pompous but remember well June 18th 1815..... Come on Ye noblest English...
