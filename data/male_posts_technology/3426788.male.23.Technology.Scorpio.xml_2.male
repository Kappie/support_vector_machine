It was true – my first dig at personal website creation was terrible than a neophyte’s practice work. A Bad design in Flash was the culprit.  I wanted to put everything in my website. Programming articles, Game designing tutorials, Several Links  Hundreds of utilities … My present website wasn’t even accommodating my info. On 5’th night, I was searching for good layouts for my website n suddenly Voila! I found one. It was a sleek, sophisticated online curriculum vitae layout by Ubooty (A company based in Norfolk,UK). By the way it was free.  I downloaded it enthusiastically and created my home page with minimal efforts. This time by hopes were centered on Flash’s elder brother Macromedia Dreamweaver. What a Name !!! Dream Weaver. Hats off to them.  As I was going strong  creating my web pages at a speed of nauts, I confronted a IceBerg straight ahead. The web page layout by UBooty Had a complete table in a web page  all components arranged in different table cells  rows. So if u want to delete extra components  resize the table -> IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE … It resulted in Long web pages even when the content was merely 2 lines long …..  I tried relentlessly, only to find wall straight ahead n a head bang ….  I was getting frustrated … Never ever I was so much annoyed with myself… Damn it... I thought … It was a simple web page … and I used to deal with Goliaths of C++, Visual C++ and .Net. I shut down my computer  relaxed on my bed. Deciding to forget everything bout that website.  I couldn’t concentrate anywhere else. Not even my favourite Yahoo Chat … Where I love to play All Star Counselor. Self Proclaimed Shrink. I’m chatting for last 6 yrs now  I’ve seen all kinda peepz here. Straight forward, Backstabbers, weak hearted, Wicked, Timid, Brash, Liars, Candid but there is a line of similarity which passes through all of them. They all need A Life Saving Support System.  Chatting is an addiction like any other addiction. When you get weak, When u loose control over ur life, When situation overpowers u, When you pass the reigns in the hands of Destiny n decide to enjoy bumpy ride in the back seat ……. You need someone, something, some way somewhere to rekindle past or Just to tickle yourself with the past without accepting the present tense hence trying to be someone who could have looked like/behaved like/been like this one in the past galore of glories.  Chatting gives you the same satisfaction. Freedom of being someone you are not, you were, you want to be, you always wanted to be or someone you never can be. It answers an impeding question, why do peepz visit Dance Bars or such filthy places. There for a piece of currency, they can enjoy the pre-eminence.  Power, Control, Freedom … Addictions give you everything for those split seconds ….  Maybe Life is like a Carrot hanging in front of a donkey... Like u n me ... So we run in the Great Optimistic mood in the Hope of catching the carrot which furthers with every step.  My website creation lead me to the point where I felt I couldn’t do anything to improve my situation. Suddenly, a thought kissed my cerebrum. I’ve done so many things before  toyed with all these tools. Why can’t I do this again?  I studied the whole layout again. Understanding the base concept... I created my own web page using layout’s graphics. WOW … It was piece of cake then :P  It was already morning of 6’th June.  Yesterday’s French Open Ladies Final was a Drag. Two inexperienced players playing in historic grand finale for the first time n one awed  by the situation, second one in the same seat but holding both the handles. Thank God , It ended. Anyways, Congrats to the Anastasia Myskina. Well Now her name is taken from Russian domain. She looks like a Mink though.   I started developing my website rapidly. My information, scorpio graphics .. all were in place. I wanted a big page for all links section which I placed categorically. Linkin those hundreds of websites was a neck breaking task, still I managed it. Due to sheer anticipation of website completion  a Gentleman named Mr. Ralf Luve.  If you know Mr. Ralf Luve, congrats. Let us draw some inspiration from this german. He works as a Systems Administrator in an Internet Service company in Germany. He is 32 yrs old. He is married and HE HOLDS 5 GUINESS RECORDS !!! Huh .. Lemme tell u bout his latest one … Have you ever heard the term “ Rubic Cube”? Imagine solving it in 5 minutes … What? Simple? Piece of Cake? Rookie’s Delight? … Well How bout solving it in 5 minutes … BLINDFOLDED …HA HA HA …. See tha’s the gr8 thing bout him. He did it. Gosh … I was spellbound, enthralled,  awestruck, agape ….. everything at the same time … Mebbe I won’t act such even wid Ms. Pamela Anderson Live In Person n Naked ….  Talk bout Mind over Matter  this guy was amazing. It proved Mr. Albert Einstien right, who used to use 40% of his brain. We are better than any super computer. Only we should know ourselves.  Remember the Dialogue from THE MATRIX ->    Don’t think you are… Know you are … !!!     It pushed me  finally I was able to finish my website. Still one last glitch was waiting. Counter on my main page. As I moved my site from yahoo’s geocities (provides 25 mb) to 125mb(provides exactly same 125 mb), my counter was gone. It was important to me in a sense of contentment. I searched again n again … found several free counters … registered with them .. result -> A counter with an ad. Again I was looking towards the window of melancholy. But as I was already stirred by Mr. Ralf’s otherworldly record, I decided to write my own counter. Which I precisely did with the help of My favourite Microsoft’s website. Tha’s why I’m an Ardent Fan of Microsoft.   Long Live Microsoft.
