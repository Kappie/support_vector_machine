I ordered the full version and received the upgrade.  Fortunately after kicking and screaming they agreed to take it back and give me the one I ordered.  So today I have nothing to report.  Until next time download some of my music to keep yourself busy while waiting for more juicy news.  My Music:   urlLink rickkrenmayer.com
