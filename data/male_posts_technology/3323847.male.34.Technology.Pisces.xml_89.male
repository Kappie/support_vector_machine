Now she's peeved that this  FREE  service lost her data?  Sorry, no matter how I juggle it, I just can't scrape up any sympathy what-so-ever for this woman.  If you rely on FREE services for business-critical information, you're taking a huge gamble and only have yourself to blame if things go wrong.  One final comment: As an intelligent internet shopper, I'd be extremely reluctant to do business with a company that had "@hotmail.com", "@yahoo.com" or "@aol.com" at the ass-end of their e-mail address.  Setting up an "@mybusiness.com" these days requires little effort and even less knowledge, so there's really no excuse at this point.
