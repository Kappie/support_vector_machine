It is the only animal that invites its friends to have sex with its mate. It feels no jealousy. And among people who consume pork, the practice of wife swapping and other forms of promiscuous behaviour is common. "  Yeah you know now I think of it, after i eat pork , sometimes i am like really tempted to call up my friends and have an orgy.
