Anyone know details for it? When? Where? I missed my last lesson due to textiles exam so meh.  Um, I'm all injured. My neck is killing me when I look down so being on the till today won't help at all. Its partly the way I sleep, I sleep in a funny position and also partly due to stress. I have noticed how when I am very very stressed some limb or something hurts. The other week I couldn't breath properly because my ribs were hurting. Now its my neck. Ack.  Tom blog bitte. :)
