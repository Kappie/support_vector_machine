My catcher loves to go inside on hitters and the one thing I know is that I am not goin to blow anyone away inside.  I just don't throw hard enough.  So I got burned a couple times.  I also gave up a lot of bloop hits.  I didi go 2-2 with a walk and a run.  That puts my average at .500 (not too shabby).  I went home Sunday and saw my brother's play a game.  My dad is not coaching them this year because of a schedule problem that ended up not being a problem at all.  He gets to see all the games and it is killing him that he is not coaching.  Dr. Sculte is their coach and oh the memories it brings back.  He was my coach when I was 12 in Little League.  I think he is still telling the same stories that he was telling then.  It is funny to see Colin and Matt react to him.
