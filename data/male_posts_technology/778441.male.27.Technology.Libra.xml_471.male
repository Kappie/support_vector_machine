This is similar to the written application filed by Saquib Nachan, the prime accused in the Mulund bomb blast case. Nachan successfully managed to stall the court proceedings by claiming in his application that he had no faith in the POTA judge A P Bhangale.  By doing this, the accused have effectively ridiculed the authority of the court and in turn, the authority of law. And its sickening to know that these scum are managing to get away with it too!  I have very rudimentary knowledge of law, but this sounds like a candidate for 'contempt of court' to me. The Contempt of Courts Act of 1971 states that...   “criminal contempt” means  the publication (whether by words, spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise) of any matter or the doing of any other act whatsoever which  —   (i) scandalises or tends to scandalise, or  lowers or tends to lower the authority of, any court ; or  (ii) prejudices, or interferes or tends to interfere with, the due course of any judicial proceeding; or  (iii) interferes or tends to interfere with, or obstructs or tends to obstruct, the administration of justice in any other manner    [emphasis mine]  Well?!
