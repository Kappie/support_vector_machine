Will they help as the economy improves? I hope so, and, so after the MCP what next? Either go for the MCSA or the CCNA. One must improve one's martketability, shouldn't one?  My current job supporting the poor abused customers of CompUSA is not taxing and helps pay the bills. It also allows me to study for the certs..  Bush will win this fall much to the dismay of the haters out there :)
