 On August 23rd,  urlLink Chief Justice Roy Moore  was removed from his seat on the Alabama Supreme Court for deliberately disobeying a court order to remove a statue of the Ten Commandments from the state judicial building.  Now, every school kid learns that one essential tenant of the US form of government is separation of church and state.  But what exactly does this mean?  The  urlLink first amendment  states, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..."
 
 So the man on CNBC was partially right; in their usual shifty wording, the founding fathers were attempting to restrict the governmentâ€™s ability to tread on citizens' religious freedom in two ways.  First, they believed that there should be no government sponsored religion such as the Church of England.  Second, they wanted to make sure the government would not restrict anyone's freedom to practice religion.
 
 Unfortunately (and contrary to what Justice Moore's supporters might state), it is clear that the court ruling to remove the statue violates neither condition set forth by the first amendment.  Removal of the statue does not constitute the establishment or prohibition of religion.  It merely means that no religion may be practiced in the state owned court house.  If the statue were left in place however, the state could be viewed as condoning one particular religion, which in fact, it is.
 
 This was the opinion passed by a federal district court judge who ordered the statue removed.  Moore disagreed with this decision, but was denied an appeal by both the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court.  Out of legal options (or so he thought), Moore decided to disobey the ruling and left the statue in the court house rotunda.
 
 This type of disobedience is not new to Chief Justice Moore.  He has a  urlLink history  of clashes regarding the ten commandments -- so many, in fact, that he was known as the "Ten Commandments Judge" even before this event boiled over.  Raised to believe that Christianity is the foundation of the entire government and its laws, Moore has consistantly refused to separate church and state and in doing so has broken the law.  Moore seems to have some delusion that he is standing up to an oppressive law,  urlLink as if he were Dr. Martin Luther King .  
 
 No, Justice Moore, you are no Dr. King.  Moore may have some sort of morale case here, but he is in no position to argue.  He must uphold the law, no matter how much he may personally disagree.  We need judges who do not uphold the law as much as we need airport security screeners to fall asleep on the job.
 
 Chief Justice Moore has blatantly refused to accept the decision of superior courts, which lead to his fellow Supreme Court justices' unanimous decision to suspend him.  Those justices should carry forth and fully dismiss Moore.  He does not belong in our justice system.  This is not a question of whether or not the statue should be allowed in the Birmingham court house.  This is not a question about whether or not the U.S. government is indoctrinated by God.  This is about Chief Justice Roy Moore's history of disobeying court orders and his outright refusal to stand down in the face of the highest law of the land.  He has broken his oath to serve as a judge, and for that he should be permanently removed from his position on the Alabama Supreme Court.
