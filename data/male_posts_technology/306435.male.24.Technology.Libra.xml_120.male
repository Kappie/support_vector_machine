Ann is leaving for SAn Diego tomorrow to see her Uncle, then will head off to Rancho La Puerta.  I thought this was going to be a spa, but after she read the web page she seems to make it out to be a get in shape camp.  Evidently they are not allowed to eat anything but vegetables the first few days and will be getting up at 6 a.m. for morning walks.    Justin came over last night and we watched the MTV Movie Awards.  After work today Tom and I went to Wal-mart to purchase a television and we also found a bunch of connections in the neighborhood.  I think I can get around the Hyde Park area a lot better now.
