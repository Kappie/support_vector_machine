As I said before I am a big fan of the Scion xB, and for those who are not familar with both Scion and the xB, go to http://www.scion.com and look for the xB. But anyway, Im trying to find a job, like most people, but I am having a hard time finding one. If anybody has any info on anyjobs in the Bradenton/Sarasota area, email me at k_evil1986@yahoo.com. I need to get a job so I can get my Scion. Anyway im out, Ill talk to ya later. Peace.
