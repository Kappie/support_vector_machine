Well, I have 4 weeks left in work so I am starting to really focus on exactly what it is I am going to do in a few weeks time. As usual I am super duper organised and rearing to go.. hehe, yes that does mean I haven't got a clue where I am going first.. Million things to do and no idea what order I am going to do them in.. Oh well..  Weekend was good. On Friday evening I got EVER so slightly drunk.. Not like me at all, I know. I went to a freaks and geeks drinking session with a load of the  urlLink boards.ie  mods and users which was "interesting" to say the least (finaly met a friend of mine from the states that I have never actually met IRL before) and managed to scare Helena and her friend Liam (Sheep Shager from New Zealand).. They had never met a group of people that introduced themselves by their nicknames before (With the exception of bubbles)  Anyway, we were there for an hour or two and then headed over to the Capitol to have drinks with Jonny Karl and the boys before they head of on holidays (The bastards) and got merrily pissed there. Poor Helena had a black russian spilt all over her after "Dave" was made jump by Bubbles head-giving antics and I kissed Liam.. (Yes, the Sheep Shager from New Zealand) I almost took the guys eye out in the process but I think he still loves me anyway. After that we went to Rí-Rá (Me, Helena and Liam) where they actually beat me at Table-Footy (I claim alcohol poisoning) but I did go on to trounce them several times after that.. Wh0ot!  Then Sunday came around.. HeHeHe.. Where to begin..  First off I had been invited last weekend to a trip to Glendalough with Helena, Liam, Emer and Claire to have a walk in the area and do the whole touristy thing with my favorite New Zealander.. Yes, you guessed it, my secret love... Liam... Well, actually it isn't that secret really is it.. Anyway.. During the week the invitation changed a little bit and I was invited to lunch in avoca handweavers with the gang AND Helenas Mum and Dad.. OK.. I have met them before and things are going really REALLY well with Helena.. Meeting the parents can't be that bad, may as well get it over and done with. Anyway it isn't the first time.. I did a quick "Hi, How are you? Oh is that the time? Must go to Salsa" last Tuesday and they seemed very nice.  What the Hell  Let's meet the parents...  What it turned into was a regular Clan gathering.. I was sitting with the aunt on one side, Helena on the other, one cousin diagonaly accross from me on one side, Helenas sister opposite me (but I like her so that wasn't too bad) and the mum diagonaly accross from me on the other side.. Then The Dad, Uncle and another cousin on the next table down with Emer and Liam (Ahhhh, Sweet Liam..)  HeHe Actually I have to say it was actually very nice.. The parents were very friendly (didn't get talking to the dad really, but he didn't seem to hate me yet! Wh0ot me!) and the Aunt had no idea who I was.. asked me twice if I worked with Helena in the process of fishing for info.. Was quite funny really because I didn't volunteer any info either ;) (HeHe.. Hi Helena, how are you ;) I didn't say anything bad about your family at all...)  Anyway, after that it was the walk around the monastery and the lower and upper lakes in Glendalough.. Very nice I must say.. And we managed to finish the walk and get in the car JUST as it started to lash rain.  I had hoped to make it to the academy salsa class but unfortunately I was exhausted by the time we got back to Dublin and had missed half the class anyway so me and Helena had a nice evening watching very bad things on video. (was kinda disapointed with that film actually.. oh well) and then just watching tv.. Was very couple-ish behaviour ;)  And then there was today.. So far so good but hey, lets see what happens later. Going to go watch Fight Club on DVD in Emers later with Helena, Emer, Claire and sweet sweet Liam :D  K, That will have to do you for now :) Talk later :)  "Big G"  hehehe what are you doing still reading.. Go Get lost...
