I got very much excited and nervous about attending the interview that,I felt that such a large company would provide tough questions for an interview. The interview was on Monday.I went through all of C,C++ and protocol suites.The whole of saturday and sunday was wasted on those subjects.I was very much confident on JAVA ,because this was very much my domain.  I didn't get a copy of my re'sume' and found that cyber cafes don't open at 9.00a.m every day.So,I found my b-in-law on the road ,went to his office and took a copy . I boarded the bus and after walking for nearly 2KM found SISL in the interior of Gurgaon(should have called them for a landmark).The interview was at 10.30a.m.I entered SISL building and was called for an interview exactly at 10.30a.m. I thought ,companies in India shouldn't be that punctual.They should atleast follow the usual waiting game.I am pretty much accustomed to that protocol.  The people interviewing me were pretty much looked ike kids.The guy was floundering for questions and the gal looked somewhat odd.I had to write down most of the questions in  order to understand what the guy was asking about and the gal distracted me for most of the time.I couldn't answer some questions which were quite basic to me.Oh!my god !this girl has large things ,jutting out of her very interiors.Thats it! It was her teeth that distracted me. Well,she was supposed to ask me questions on database languages.But,I didn't write those in my CV.But ,she insisted on asking me something on databases.I told her ,i am very much ignorant about the databases ,except that I can just look on to the book to write the queries for a database.  I contacted the HR guy after 2 days .He told me the rejection of my candidature rather beautifully.It was like this "Your name has not featured in the short-listed candidates,but ,I will recommend your re'sume' to other companies".  There goes my first software interview after 2 years of waiting for one.
