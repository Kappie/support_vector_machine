Well it's not that, the new job would be the same as the one I have now. Same hours and all. I work 8am-4.30pm M-F and I have evenings and weekends with my daughter (well, plus I talk to her all day online during the summer. During the winter she's in school anyway.) So essentially I'd be doing the same job, same hours, for much more pay. My hangup is my loyalty to the hospital I work for. I love it here. But then, the opportunities for advancement and/or transferring to other parts of the country are better with the new job.   Anyway I appreciate everyone's input and I have followed some advice and taken on board other advice and looked at all my options. Today I spoke with my current boss about it because he the kind of approachable boss who has his employees' best interests at heart and he basically told me that the hospital would hate to see me go, but his advice was that I have to do what's best for me and my daughter, and if it means a change, it means a change. He said I shouldn't feel bad about leaving the hospital because you have to go where the opportunities are.  So I feel a hell of a lot better today. More optomistic at my chances to improve my life and my daughter's life. Thanks to everyone who's given me encouragement and advice on this. You've all been incredibly helpful!
