And so, for the next 3 or so months, you can find me located on my futon in my bedroom, most likely laying on my side, whilst on my laptop. Thats right, I said whilst, I'm trying to incorporate in some old english into my life. Will it work? no, but what have I got to lose....The respect of most of my friends? Possibly.....  Today's been a relatively good day, as opposed to days that aren't quite as good as this one.  The main event of today, happened at around 5:29-ish this afternoon. It was at that time, when I got a GMail account. For those of you that don't know what GMail is, Its Google's new E-mail service which is currently in Beta testing, and isn't avaliable to the general public. The only way to get a GMail account to call your own is by knowing people who already have a GMail account that can invite you to get it. So if you ever need to e-mail me, please, don't use my Hotmail account, as it sucks ass. E-mail me at  leedeaton@gmail.com  from now on.  And yesterday, I played poker over at Neil's, which was a mistake...turns out Neil used to play poker quite often a few years back, and after a slow start, he proceeded to kick our asses. So the only business that I'll be doing over there, is ordering pizza.  I've noticed why I like poker so much! Its because I can't stand to be worse at something than somebody. Same thing happened with Battlefield 1942. Sure, it was fun and all, but people were still better than me at it, and that bugged the hell out of me, so I played more and more, until I caught the eye of a clan, who took me in, and made me even better, and it was in that clan that I became a pilot, and when I started that, I sucked ass, but with some help from 2 brothers, named Golden Eye, and Knives, I became better than them. When I played in a scrim against my old clan, I could actually say to them "When I left you I was but the learner, now I am the master" and mean it! And I then proceeded to shoot them down in about 3.8 seconds. and it was then that I knew that I was amungst the top 5 in the world at being a pilot for that game. And my quest for perfect-ness, was accomplished. And so now, after BF 1942 is dead, I took up a new hobby, Poker, and I'm on that same quest. So in about 5 years or so, watch out....  Appearantly theres something wrong with the comments on here, and how you have to be a member to post one. Well, from what I see, you don't have to, so I don't know what you're complaining about. So whoever reads this post, please, try and leave a comment, and if it doesn't work, e-mail me to let me know that it wouldn't work.   Update:  I found my USB thumbdrive! It was in the pocket of a pair of jeans I barely wear, but I guess wore once, and forgot about the thunbdrive. so, yay!  And as I said, if you're going to e-mail me about anything, wether it be if I think the Red Sox are going to make it to the World Series, or if you can't make a comment, please, e-mail me at  leedeaton@gmail.com .
