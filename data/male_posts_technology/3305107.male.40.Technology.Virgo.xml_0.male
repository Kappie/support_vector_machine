Well, I have news for you, you can be replaced. As much as I don't want to have to terminate you, because you do a good job, I am willing to spend the training time on a team player who has a good attitude versus putting up with the crap you stir daily. Don't think this business can't run without you, because every position can be filled, even the CEO. That is what I am thinking about today.
