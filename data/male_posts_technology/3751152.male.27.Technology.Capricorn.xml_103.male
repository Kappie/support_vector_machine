I now go in sometime in September.  Kind of put a dampener on the last bit of the meet for me (I went home soon after).        It isn't that I particularly want to have a craniotomy.  It is more that I just want to get this all over and done with so that I can get back to a reasonably normal life (or what passes for one around here).        Bomo - it was good, a worthy end to a decade of meets :)  We have all grown up so much - after all, we are now old enough to play bingo and not snigger (too much).  Get the Nora Batty stockings and the zimmer frames out.        Anyway, I had a fantastic time - I've been on the dodgems, been to Poole quay, been bingo-ing (as above), been to the beach, been clubbing (and let's face it, I haven't been dancing for a hell of a long time and boy had I missed it)...I basically did everything in one weekend (and have been sleeping nonstop since!)      Thanks to Matt for an excellent end to the Bomo decade :)
