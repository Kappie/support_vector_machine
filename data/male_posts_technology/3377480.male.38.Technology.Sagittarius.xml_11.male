A Man and His Pool    while sitting one day sipping a cold one  the kids and she who must be obeyed  wanted a pool  who needs a herb garden  we want a pool we want a pool   the poor man was beat  he had to take the heat  and then listen to them whine Oh for a glass of wine  Online he ordered what was the answer  till the big day  the truck driver on his way asked if he had a forklift No was the reply to this  to massive disgust all around  4 pallets and 1600 lbs  Oh my back On my back  and now he is installing it  with pto from work  Or is he
