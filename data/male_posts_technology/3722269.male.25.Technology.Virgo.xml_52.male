Prestinely restored, with meticulous black flames painted on the bonnet and down the sides... now imagine these flames edged with gold paint... now imagine the whole car bobbing in the water, at the end of a jetty,  20m from shore, in a rotorua lake. Brilliant. Rotorua homies score again.    Current music playing:  Rhombus - Bass Player Album  Currently drinking:  Bundaberg Diet Ginger Beer  Dinner:  Ham  Egg Toasted Sammy, and a hotdog.  I've just finished baking a cake. Yeah, I know, but everyone kinda didnt make a big fuss about a friend of mines birthday, and she's coming to visit tomorrow, so I thought I'd bake a cake, put childish little candles in it, and make a big fuss.    I think it'll be fun, and hey - if it gets a smile, then its all good. Today I got told, that I was amazing, by text, that I'd made someones day.. that their huge smile was because of me.. I'll tell ya, there's no better feeling than that. It really makes me warm from the inside out.  Have a great night, even if you're getting shitfaced on Jaggermeister and RedBull. Ka Kite Ano folks.
