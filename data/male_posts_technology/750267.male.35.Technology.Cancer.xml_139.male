The FBI  urlLink announced today  that it's launched a full-scale investigation into the leak of a CIA agents name that originated from the White House. On CNN last night, one interviewee said that this White House source had called "several" reporters to blow the agent's cover. Only snakey Robert Novak had the stupidity to write about it.  There seems to be a general defence of Robert Novak's actions in the media these days, as if he played no part in this alleged crime. I say, if a crime has been committed, he played as big a part as the person who leaked the information. I mean, he knowingly blew an agent's cover in a national newspaper, putting unknown lives at risk. (Yes, the agent herself is not a field agent, but she may have had roles gathering information, or acting as a go-between, in other ways.)  This is going to get worse before it gets better for President Bush:   The focus on Rove brought an odd twist to Bush's travels. When the president boarded Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base outside of Washington, he walked up the steps and waved -- and not a single camera followed. He looked momentarily perplexed. All lenses were trained on Rove at the bottom of the steps.
