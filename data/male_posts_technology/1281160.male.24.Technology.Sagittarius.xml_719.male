Since most items that I wanted topost there is being posted at  Quod scripsi, scripsi ,  I decided to change its focus towards something else. I've got a couple of ideas about the directions that  Rantings of a sane mind  should take. I guess it might be the end of the year before it gets sorted out. So you'll have to wait for some time before it gets back on track.  I wouldn't agree that bloging is my hobby. It has become a part of my regular life nowadays. Since we use the blog as a platform for discussing, I don't feel that blogging is a hobby. It's more like a indirect conversation. You were right in saying that reading cannot be considered a hobby. Searching for a definition of hobby gave me these descriptions: hobby: (noun) -    An activity or interest pursued outside one's regular occupation and engaged in primarily for pleasure;   an auxiliary activity;   a subject or plan upon which one is constantly setting off;  a favorite and ever-recurring theme of discourse, thought, or effort;   that which occupies one's attention unduly, or to the weariness of others;   a ruling passion.    Considering point no. 4, 5 and 6, can it be presumed that love is a hobby? Any thoughts.
