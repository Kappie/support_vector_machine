It is mandatory to have these in your pets in some states, so they have information about the dog or whatever.  Soon we will be able to buy stuff by just walking out of the store. The transaction will fly thru the air and you never have to worry about it again. It will fufill a prophecy that you wont be able to buy or sell without something in your right hand or on your forehead.  This really bothers me, People can track your every move and it is really creepy...  ---  In other news Harrison went to CHURCH!  O  M  G.
