Remember to wave your pink IC around and throw it in their faces shouting "  Ar hahahaha, chow recruit / NSF, wahahahahha ... ORD liao ORD liao!! Me 3SG (NS) Foo now ... wahahahah you suckers!!" Eh wait wait, I still got 4 mths to serve, scarly you'll see me there one of those days.  Yea, well even though I was kinda in a bad mood, but I think I might have overeacted. Coz when one of the girls threw an old Chinese New Year decoration at me, I kinda went a bit off the edge and just said, "Eh please, I feel like scolding some vulgarity now hor, ok." Think that kinda told the whole room what kind of state my mood was in. Of course, now I think of it, I'm just glad I didn't. She didn't like do anything really bad. And even if the others were a bit noisy, I think it doesn't really warrant an overeaction on my part. I dunno, sometimes you really get the kind of effect like Stephen Chow's movies Xi You Ji (Journey to the West) part 1 and 2, where Tripitaka was like a freaking fly always buzzing around the ears. I mean, c'mon lah, even Guan Yin in the show tried to trottle him once. To those who've not seen it, let me try to illustrate this point:  Wukong was trying to steal some heavenly device and got caught by Guan Yin. While meting out punishment, Tripitaka arrived at the scene and started pleading for mercy on Wukong's behalf, but he has this stupid habit of talking too much (in a very irritating sort of way). He says: "Wukong, why didn't you tell me you wanted the magic box? I mean you should have told me you wanted it. If you've told me you wanted it then I would've given it to you. You didn't need to steal it. If you didn't tell me about it, then how can I give it to you?... "  And somehow, the sentence isn't quite over, he still went on and on and on and on. If you actually translated it into Chinese, you can tell it's a long sentence. Especially irritating since all the sentences contained basically one meaning only. Just that it's magnified 10x. You probably just need to go watch the show yourself to know how funny it really is.  Anyway, think later I'll apologise to them about my mood lastnight. But I still think it was a bit irritating. I like to watch my own show and movie quietly. Anything you don't understand, I think can be settled at the end of the show. Of course, if your memory isn't too good, then that's probably going to be a problem. Think in this case, just remember that it's a S-H-O-W or a M-O-V-I-E, and just accept it as it is. That's a good enough reason. I also really can't be bothered to put too much effort to convince others about how I interpreted what I've watched, unless the topic deserves a good discussion.
