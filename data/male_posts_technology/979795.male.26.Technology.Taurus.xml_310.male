But turns out the 'suspectee' (??) went to see RSM about some things and it didn't turn very pleasant. Heard he was complaining and commenting about making complaints to MP, etc. Goodness man, seriously don't know how NSFs think these days. I'm pretty disturbed byt what I would kinda describe as 'mental' cases serving NS. Even one particular clerk in my unit has the weirdest way of thinking about responsibility. People who took a lot of MCs means there's a requirement for him to dig out their dockets and file in medical paperwork. For people who don't take too many MCs often, he feels that because he doesn't touch their dockets too often, hence when it turns out some document went missing, it's these people's fault and not his fault for losing the documents. ??? How on earth is that logical? ANd he has the nerve to say things like "I could've complained to my psychologist, who happens to be an MP, and these people will get into trouble." Oh c'mon man, I've not heard a more ridiculous logic. If an MP is willing to carry this case forward, I'd classify him/her as another nutcase.  These 2 guys are harmless really. It's just the way their thought process works that's really disturbing. It's not that I'm unsympathetic to some of their cases, but I find it increasingly frustrating to try to talk to them. Most of them are in a world of their own. Whenever I speak to them, they can hear me but they don't really listen. And I do worry for them like how they're going to cope after they ORD. The world outside is not as forgiving or sympathetic as the SAF.  Well I've been sick the past 2 and a half days. Still went for Aikido on Thurs and it felt really good. Somehow I just didn't feel as sick after that. Going to camp was kinda difficult as the medicine made me drowsy pretty often.  Realised the Singapore Marathon is drawing closer and I still haven't clocked up enough distance to feel ready for the run. Now that I'm sick, I'm not sure I'll get enough traiing inside to be ready in time.  Eileen, also just reminded that grading is drawing near. But no preassure on that. I feel so happy training that I just want to continue attending lessons rather than go take the test.  Oh yea, I'm still eagerly waiting for some kinda response from the Police Force. Dec is dragging really close now. ORD loh.
