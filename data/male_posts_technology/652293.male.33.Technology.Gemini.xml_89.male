A focus on customers is a good thing from a customer point-of-view, and the tag line is just vague enough to sound good without really saying anything.  That said, I wish more companies would adopt this tag line and be focused on customers.  Focusing on money won't build a business.  Focusing on customers (who then willingly bring money) allows a business to really grow.  Now, I just need to trademark that phrase...  (Patent pending. Patent pending. Patent pending. ;)
