I still need to order teh dani's valentines-day-present-thingimajiig. If it doesnt get here on time...i'll have to give her something cheezy...like..a rose or something....   You are my only girl, but you're not my owner girl. Talk to me... dance with me here in the spotlight, girl. Talk to me... dance with me here. You're the spotlight girl. So perfect you paint it... yet so manipulated. So calm and so patient... yet oh so calculated. So safe and comforting... this doesn't feel like flirting. So fun I'm distracted... forgot you keep track of it.  Hot hot heat - "Talk to me, Dance with me"  Song almost works, but...*cant dance*  [Back in the USSR]
