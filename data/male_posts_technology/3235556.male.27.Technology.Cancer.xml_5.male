This scenario is involving an ATM machine, and a friend of a friend of mine, to remain nameless of course, to protect the life of this stupid individual.  This girl was traveling among friends and needed some cash, and asked to stop at a local ATM machine.  As most of us know, the ATM will ask for a PIN, then a transaction type, and if asking for a withdrawal, will ask for an amount.  There are some people who are just totally lost at this point.  The machine states in plain English, you must enter an amount in $X increments,X being 5, 10, and even 20.  This particular machine happened to allow $5 increments, meaning you can withdraw $20 and get 4 - 5 dollar bills.  This particular nameless individual, who also happened to be blonde, took the statement to mean that one can only take $5 out at a time.  Here's the dilemma, the girl needed $50. She proceeded to swipe her card, go through the motions and remove $5 from the machine with a transaction fee of $1.50 because the ATM was not of her bank. She proceeded to repeat this mundane task another 9 times, thus adding up to $50 withdrawn and about $15 in transaction fees, not to mention her own bank may charge a dollar or two on top of that.  After hearing this story, which by the way happens to be totally true,I didn't know whether to laugh hysterically or pass out in total amazement.
