On the other hand, we did get almost 200 hits in our first month.  Not too shabby.   But it's always good to review one's purpose.  It helps clarify thoughts and focus efforts.  With that in mind,  let's restate the purpose of this blog:     -Free Markets  -Rational thought  -Limited Government    Right here in the People's Republik of Eugene.  Here's our mission statement.  It's so simple, that we don't even need to print it on a laminated card:   TAKE 'EM DOWN!   So, Mr. Hate filled underachiever who hides his contempt for the world in a green sauce of Eco-nut mantras:         You are going down.   Ms. Economic-justice crusader who destroys businesses because of her concern for the poor:         You are going down.     Even you, Mr Pink Rebublican, who sees increased government as the only way to fix problems.        Right down with the rest of them.    Saving the world is really hard work, but I promise to pick two or three local items every week and take 'em down.   Thanks for listening    Update: I hope Bob doesn't mind me stringing my thoughts onto his posts. I guess he doesn't, or you wouldn't be reading this.    Rational Thought:  To this end, my posts are (mostly) rationalized by past experiences and firsthand knowledge, but the world's a big place. If anyone spots holes in my analysis, please let me know. We'll have cawfee an' tawk.   The Pink Republican mentioned above has a name in my mind. Pat Farr. Quoth: "I'm a republican, but I'm a republican from Eugene." So I guess he's lukewarm to government control, social spending, etc.    I smell waffles. Mmmmm, waaaffles. (/Homer)   Update by hockeypuck
