Whenever we sent out email to non-existant Gmail email accounts from non Gmail addresses or even in Gmail address, we do not get any Permanent errors or fatal error messages back to the senders address which is normally the case. As per Karan, they store the emails.  What makes it quite interesting is that someone signed on as {username}@Gmail.com and found over a 100 e-mails waiting for him on his first login, some from as long as 2 months back. Apparently someone had been mistakenly sending emails to this {username} and the emails seem to have been stored up  . "
