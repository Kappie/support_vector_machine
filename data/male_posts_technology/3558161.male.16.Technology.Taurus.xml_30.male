Crush me with the things you do And  I'll do for you anything  too Sitting smoking feeling high And in this moment  it feels so right   Lovely lady I am at your feet  God I want you so badly  And I wonder this  Could tomorrow be So wondrous as you there sleeping  Let's go drive 'till morning comes Watch the sunrise and fill our  souls  up Drink some wine 'till we get drunk  It's crazy I'm thinking Just knowing that the world is round And here I'm dancing on the ground Am I right side up or upside down   Is this real or am I dreaming?    Lovely lady Let me drink you please Won't spill a drop, no,  I promise you   Lying under this spell you cast on me    Each moment The more I love you   Crush me Come on, oh yeah  It's crazy I'm thinking Just knowing that the world is round And here I'm dancing on the ground Am I right side up or upside down Is this real or am I dreaming?  Lovely lady I will treat you sweetly Adore you, I mean you crush me And it's times like these When my faith I feel  And I  know  how I love you  Come on, Come on Baby  It's crazy I'm thinking Just as long as you're around And here I'll be dancing on the ground Am I right side up or upside down  To each other we'll be facing By love By love   We'll beat back the pain we've found  You know I mean to tell you all the things I've been thinking deep inside My friend   With each moment, the more I love you.    Crush me Come on Baby So much you have given love That I would give you back again and again Oh my love Meaning  I'll hold you   But please please let me  always     So what do you say?
