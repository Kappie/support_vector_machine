He was in the air a short while - we drove down and picked him up. We started on the Burma road loop, which was termed "short but astoundingly steep" (read  urlLink here ), trying Stephen's mountain board wherever we could. It was fun, with its share of falls - I fell once, Stephen fell once. Climbing down the steep start was dangerous and slippery. I fell a couple of times more.. we ended the evening with dinner at an English pub in Danville - fish and chips English style - yum! None of us had a camera, unfortunately.
