So would you like three to four pop-under windows to be shown whenever you visit the blog. So, can't use it for the blog, da.  BTW, What happenned this weekend, No news from anyone?   I've updated the bio's slightly. Still waiting for inputs from you all...  last night, watched "Behind Enemy Lines" for the third time.
