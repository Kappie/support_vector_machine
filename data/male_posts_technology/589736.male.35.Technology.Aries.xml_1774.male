As I said before, it is extremely ironic that people will chose to burn the symbol of the country that allows them protest peacefully without getting thrown in jail or worse.  People will say that burning the flag is an expression of free speech.  Hog wash.  If burning something is free speech, then the KKK cannot be prosecuted for burning crosses as a symbol of what they believe.  Free speech does not just apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable.  The Ten Commandments - Given that every judge puts his hand on a bible and swears to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America to the best of their ability without reservation or purpose of evasion,  so help me God  and that all witnesses swear on a bible to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,  so help me God , I don't see where the disconnect is.  Additionally, can anyone say that if we as a nation were to live by the Ten Commandments, that the we would be worse off?
