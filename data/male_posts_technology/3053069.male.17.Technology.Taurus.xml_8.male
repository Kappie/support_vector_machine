I basically  got paided $10 and hour to pack up someone's house and hang out with my wonderful girlfriend. Things were great. I guess you could even say i learned to kiss Saturday. i want to go into that one but then again i dont know how. I guess its just kinda personal, although i do have to say the peopl;e house we pact has a nice Western Room, Garage, Dock Shed, Closet, and Stair Well. And the state park on 42 is a nice place. sorry inside joke. But yeah i had fun. Me and Heather went to the movie Walking Tall, it sucked. But i did have a good time, except the arm rest in the theater has a tendancy to get in the way. You know i think i like heather, and not just b/c of yesterday. She cute and fun and several other things. I know she is alot smarter and a much deeper thinker than she acts like sometimes(not that she acts in a bad way ever)She is just what i wanted. I do feel bad though b/c she paid for the snacks at the movie when that should be my job, but i will live. As for the rest of life it is just as good. School is almost out and my grades seem strong. Things seem to be cooling down with my sister and all of that though there is still a long road ahead. I need to do something with my friends now b/c we have not done anything in a long while and we need to have fun. I think stress is starting to take its toll on everyone. I was thinking on a rule they have at church, it is a no PDA rule for the youth. At first i was kinda upset about it because me and Heather would like to hug and hold hands and stuff of that nature little more. But as i thought about the no PDA i realized it was mad for a good reason. I realized Pastor made the rule b/c PDA takes your mind off of what you are really at church for, which should be god, and the same goes for youth trips, you should be there to learn and grow in god. Aslo PDA distacts others too, the silly people. Its hard to refrain from just grabbing heather and not letting go,not just b/c she is incredible, but b/c it is the only place i really get to see unless i drive forever and a day. not that i mind. i would drive forever and two days if i had to. But that is the major dilemma of the day. You know i waited 16years for yesterday, i waited 16yrs to kiss somebody and kissed somebody, i very cool somebody. And i do have to say it was worth the 16yr wait. It was really worth it. WOW is all i can say and thank you heather for yesterday. it was one of the best days of my life, though i have had many of those lately, yesterday was better than others. Sorry to ramble about yesterday but it is all i can really think about. The question that is goin through my head is the wonderment that did Heather enjoy it as much as i did. I think she did, she seemed to anyway. I hope. I bet she did. she did say i was a good kisser, that made me feel good about myself. Here is a question for ya. What makes a good kisser a good kisser.  is it something you cant descibe i feeling an emotion. Or is a good kisser good b/c of the way they kiss, the use of thier mouth and body actions. I bet it is a combination of it all. I am thinking about a new hair cut. something shorter but not short. its a sercret so dot tell. The one thing i refuse to do is sweep my bangs to one side of my face, its so ugly and i wouldnt feel put together enough. I like to be clean and put together. If i did me hair like that i dont think i would feel like me, so sorry heather im not doin it. hehe. Life is good. sorry i had to say that. its my new saying. Because right now life really is good for me at least. It seemed quick and kinda sudden me askin heather out. but i am glad, it wasnt that quick really i mean we did know each other for several weeks and we spent a weekend together on the youth trip. i guess it just seemed like it wasnt long b/c we only saw each other once a week. Although some how we have managed to fix that problem of not seein each other. its all good. i better go now my friends want to talk to me believe it or not. bye
