Wow, a week without computers - how will I function?  Just fine, actually.  If I can get some quiet time with the sitka spruce, wax myrtle, red huckleberry, salal, pitcher plant, hawks, osprey, and whatever flora and fauna I can find, I will be relaxed and peaceful.  Nothing helps my state of mind more than the forest, except maybe for forests in the mountains.  Beaches are ok, but not the same.    Listening to:  Weezer, first album (including "Buddy Holly")  I think my mood is lifting somewhat.  "Supplementing" my normal dosage of anti-depressants helps a bit, but so does just keeping my mind occupied with thoughts that are not self-destructive.  I wonder if I (and others like me) actually get addicted to depression.  In the same was as alcolholics, I don't know what to do if I haven't had my negative thoughts for the day.  I can't be happy for an extended period with falling off the emotional wagon.  If I accept that chemistry is more to blame than anything else, I am at the mercy of an imperfect body.  If I choose to believe my problems are entirely psychological, then why can't I escape the grey moods I get into?  I guess the reality is that it is both mental and physical, and I need to deal with both aspects separately, but in a coordinated effort.  Honestly, I prefer anger to the bleak grey moods that hold me captive.  Anger makes the body active, alive, gives me a purpose.  The grey fog just sucks every bit of energy and motive and caring away from me, and I just want to do nothing but sleep and wallow in self-pity.  Well, clean up loose ends at work, set out the backup tapes for someone to run, finish locating details for the casino development plans, and get out of here without offending anyone or running away.  Sure, I can do that.  Bye for a week, blogger friends (anne, kim, and others).
