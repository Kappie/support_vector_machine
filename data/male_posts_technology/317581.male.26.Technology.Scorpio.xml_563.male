Day 2 of running around greenlake has proven to me that I should have never stopped running as I am completely sore after today's 2.8 jog. Well, 3 more days and then I'll take the weekend off.  I started eating salads for lunch. Yesterday's rang up at 1.95 and it was totally yummy. We'll see how today's goes.  Peace- T
