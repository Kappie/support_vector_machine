"Pran jayey par shaan na jayey" (lose life but not self-esteem)... it was a satirical art-film that revolves around the lives and happenings in typical middle-class families living together in a mansion in Bombay... A truely satirical movie that ended with a poke at RK Laxman's "common-man". Not many people might like it for all that happens in the movie but all that was nothing but reflections of any middle-class household. It also touched some happenings of national priority and their impact on such families. To me... it was a good attempt.   Apart from that nothing useful. Just went on to read another junk mail in our groups and gave another somber reply to it. I'm tired of this.
