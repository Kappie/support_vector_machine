I was a little concerned I wouldn't loose, as my wife and daughter were away, and I didn't do a great job of journaling my food intake (this is a pretty vital tool for me to stay on track), and I ate out a lot, but I did try to do some good walking, so I think that helped make up for it. I know I went over my 30 points each day, but I think I barely stayed within my flex points, or just a bit over. I didn't "deserve" to loose the weight I suppose, but I think my body is in "loss mode" which happened last time I did WW as well. Once I hit 10% the loss slowed down a lot, and I'm expecting that to happen again.    Good things I did this week:       Even though I ate out, I made good choices. Subway has really good salads now, and they're a good way to shave a few points over having a sandwich.     Walked every day during my afternoon breaks. That makes 15 minutes walking, plus 2 * 10 getting to and from work, so 35 minutes of brisk walking a day as part of my routine.    Last week introduced activity points. Bascially there is a formula that determines how many points you can "get back" by excersizing. This is really a motivating tool for me, since it means I can eat a bit more on occasion. I don't like to abuse it, but it is nice to have some flexibility, especially when I hit 249 lbs and I have to take 2 points a day off my allowed amount.  Since the higher impact the workout, the more activity points you can get, I'm going to start doing Dance Dance Revolution again. What a great thing, I can burn calories and play a video game at the same time! It's not a joke either, and  urlLink I'm not the only one who's found the benefits of playing this game .    Note: My wife suggested that I only do my pictures once a month, so that you can notice some change. So, once a month it is! Though I don't think there's much visible change, I've noticed some clothes fitting looser. I have a pair of shorts with a build in belt I haven't been able to close for a while. It closes now, whoopee!
