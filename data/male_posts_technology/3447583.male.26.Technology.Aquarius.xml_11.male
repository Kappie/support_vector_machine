And i continue to seek the mirage for water like the deer who wanders restlessly for the estatic smell of perfume that lies within her. At this moment i will only acknowledge my inability to percieve myself as an eternal traveller, from one tunnel to another. From inapperant to apperant and then back to the next tunnel ....to appear yet again.   At this moment I shallacceptthat this journey appears more facinating than the destination.And that is why i pray :   Om, tamasoma jyotirgamaya  Om, mrityorma amritam gamaya  Om. Shanti Shanti Shanti.
