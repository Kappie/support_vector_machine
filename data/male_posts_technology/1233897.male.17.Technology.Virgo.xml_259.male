We were considering driving, but my dad’s against that. (Apparently he’s not like Jon Mark’s family who drove 5 hours to a relatives, house… I think grandparent’s, stayed a couple hours, and drove all the way back in the first day of Winter Break – lol)  *edit* he just called the airline and found out that our flight's still scheduled for tomorrow... so that shouldn't be a problem.  Friday – Saturday I had my big slumber LAN party thing. Half of the people thought it was a b-day party and half didn’t so… we got a cake and called it a sorta b-day party. ‘Twas funny. Goody, David, Cam and Matt R. couldn’t come… I was kinda bummed about that. Cam didn’t come ‘cause he didn’t have a ride, Matt didn’t come because he was sick, and I’m still not sure why Goody and David didn’t come. Somehow or other, Goody heard about the party I had for friends from school and stuff and the surrounding three (LOL) sleepovers and I think was bummed that he wasn’t invited. Looking back on it, I really should have invited him, but I was trying to keep the amount of people down at the party, and I was afraid that if I invited even one more person from Calvary, that I was going to have to invite everyone and that would have been something like 60 people from both school and church. Ah well, what’s done is done.  Anyway, the party was great… my tv gave up the ghost a few days ahead of time *stupid piece a’ ....*. Amidst the gaming consoles and general nerd-dom, we had boxing, wrestling, fast paced games of Cranium (wait, we’re heading back into the nerdness, aren’t we…) lol
