I am recent arrival in Canada from the UK. I work for a medium sized food retailer in western Canada as a systems analyst.  My hobbies include wasting time, drinking beer (or wine if there is no beer available), Reading just about anything (I've been known to read cereal boxes when I can't find anything else). Oh and annoying people on the internet by publishing a random collection of thoughts.
