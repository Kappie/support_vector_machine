Did things like iriminage, shihonage etc. One thing he tended to do was that after being thrown, he just collapses flat on the mat. Much like what Leon does. I think he doesn't really know that he needs to pop back up asap, or that it's a bit rude in terms of dojo etiquette, and how dangerous it can be if someone just collapses on top of him by accident. Well, nmind lah. His first day, so better not scare him away with all the details yet. Maybe let him know about it the next time I see it.  2nd hr was more different. We did a few pair work for iriminage and kotegaeshi. After that we got into groups for free practice. I think Sensei has gotten a bit sian of us taking so long to get into groups so he basically went "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1 group. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, another group." and so on and so on. Well after he finished pointing out my group, I turned around to face everyone. That's when I realised .... Jun was in our grp. I was like "Oh si liao si liao." Then I thought, "Heng ar, not doin nikkyo." Coz I still remembered the 1st or 2nd lesson when we had just joined BV and we did suwariwaza nikkyo. Wah ... the feeling still can remember sia. Anyway, the others in the group were, a law undergrad from NUS (tall pleasant dude I've been training with on and off, pretty decent in terms of technique also - 5th kyu I think), Chin and Lee (the Filipino 3rd kyu, think that's his name right?). Naturally none of us can move Jun in our techniques. The effect was something like this:  Nage: (Struggle with technique. Struggle struggle struggle...) Jun: Can't be moved / thrown. Nage: (Gives up) ...  Jun: (Forward roll himself) Nage: (Laughs at self and thinks ... "How on earth to do it on Jun?")  Well, Lee was quite unlucky for training lastnight. Kept getting small knocks here and there. Jun's iriminage kinda rubbed the gi a bit too hard on his lower mouth so it felt sore after that. Then Jun's shomenuchi kinda went a bit too hard and knock him on the forehead. Well no serious injury came about, but you can really see him getting little knocks by someone every few mins. At the end of class, I spoke to him for awhile and we just laughed it off. Oops ... must remember to burn him a copy of Hattori Sensei's vid to pass him next Tues.
