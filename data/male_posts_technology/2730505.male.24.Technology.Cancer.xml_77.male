I woud like to think that the person who made this is a digital artist and I hope that he/she makes a damn good living making more original and elaborate games as seen above.  That's just too damn cool.  Like the one  urlLink Bird Game .  That was pretty cool.  And the  urlLink pull the ball (Bauns)   game, that was fun as hell too.  I really don't want to keep playing but I can't help it.  It's mindless entertaining fun.  Yeah.  My brain needs a little break.  Although I think Mr. Milan Kundera is calling my name to be read as I do laundry tonight/tomorrow.  So weekend plans.  Not entirely sure.  there's a lot of basketball to be viewed this weekend.  Elite 8 berths are at stake.  Tonight will be IL vs. Duke at 9 pm.  I don't think I'm leaving the apt this evening.  This could be fun to watch.  On tomorrow's games between Bama vs. UConn and St. Joeseph vs. OK State.  That's sure to be a great games to watch tomorrow.  Not entirely sure what bar or club to visit tonight.  We shall see.  Beer is always cheap at  urlLink 602 North .  They might have a good band playing tonight.  Haven't been wanting to go to  urlLink Voodoo  lately, the place has that wanna be downtown feeling.  I just want to have a good time.  What happened to the good old days of  urlLink North Beach  when people were just there to have fun, drink, dance, meet people?  Have these people suddenly changed their bars?  If so, where the hell did they go?  Where are the fun people?  People who aren't so damn pretentious.  Places that aren't so pretentious.  Where are the old servers who actually talked to you and didn't want just your money.
