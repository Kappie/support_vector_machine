I was just doing some things that I thought would make me happy and make other people happy."  Self :  "Oh yeah?  Like what?"  Gonzo : "Well there was this one chick that I really and I thought we hit it off and all was going to be wonderful"  Self :  "So what happened?"  Gozno : "Well things really weren't working out.  It got too much for her, the timing just wasn't right and the whole   thing was just for a season."  Self :  "Well you've been gone for a while man, you forgot about your family and friends.  I think sometimes you   forgot about yourself!"  Gonzo : "Yeah, well definitely I forgot about what I wanted.  I was too focused on the other person.  That's probably not too healthy.  I definitely didn't forget about family and friends.  I still talked to them and did         things with them.  Honestly though, I fell for the girl but the girl didn't fall for me."  Self :  "Yeah I hate it when that happens.  I'm sorry to hear that but you know everything has a start and end.  It just depends how long it's going to last.  Did you have fun?"  Gonzo : "Yeah, I had fun.  I learned a lot of new things that I am grateful for.  It gives me a new dimension to myserlf."  Self :  "So you're telling me that you've changed?"  Gonzo : "Well I wouldn't call it changing.  More like learning.  Well, lemme get that straight, I evolved.  I'm still here with a few additions.  I guess I grew up too.  So in the true sense of the word I have changed but I'm still the same."  Self :  "Damn dude, you have changed.  That's some fucked up shit right there!"  Gonzo : "Whatever man, I'm still me but besides the party loving, beer drinking dancing fool you see when you go out.   This brand new Gonzo also embraces that he is a geek.  This new Gonzo has a few different ways to appreciate things and think of things in a different light.  This new Gonzo likes to read.  This new Gonzo is yet another stage in the overall evolution."  Self :  "You're a dork.  What the hell are you talking about?  you always like nerdy things and you always had nerdy friends.  True you never used to read but you've read two books in 4 months!!!  Damn man, you must have really like this girl to do that!  When was the last time you read a freakin book?  I think it's been since fucking high school man!  That's crazy!  It's good that you have a better ability to see and understand things differently or from a different perspective.  So why did you guys break up anyways?"  Gonzo : "Well she pretty much dumped me.  Actually we have done this whole quit and try again a couple of times already but this time I think she's serious about not getting back together.  I heard wind that she has a date so I guess that's it.  Eh, that's alright, I used to fight it because I thought she wanted it still and she did for awhile there but I guess not anymore.  It definitely is time to let it go on my end and not let it consume me.  I did nothing wrong here.  I tried my best and gave my all."  Self :  "Didn't you see it coming?"  Gonzo : "I didn't see it coming but there was that feeling of doubt that she was getting bored and I was stressing out the last few days that really did the job."   Self :  "Well didn't she ask for space?"  Gonzo : "Yeah, I gave her a little bit of space and thought about things.  The more I tried to pull her closer the harder she tried to run away during this whole time.  I'm not happy about how things ended but I am grateful 	for the time we spent together."  Self :  "If you had given her space things would probably be better!  Why didn't you do that instead retard!"  Gonzo : "Fuck you!"  Self :  "Fuck you too!  why don't you go make like a tree and fuck off!"  Gonzo : "Whatever bitch, why don't you stop being a all wise and mighty son of a bitch and take care of your problems too!"  Self :  "I'm not the one who got dumped"  Gonzo : "Retard, we're the same person!"  Self :  "Oh yeah"  Gonzo : "Oh well, things would have ended the same way anyways.  She wasn't willing to give me the attention that I needed and I wasn't willing to give the space that she needed.  Both of us would eventually get frustrated at each other and things would definitely be ugly.  Self :  "That sounds good.  Did you make that up yourself?  Gonzo : "Hell no, I didn't change that much!  I heard it from the other party, thought about it and bought it.  See  if I was still the same me as I was like last year, I would b thinking that there was another guy involved.  She was just breaking up with me to go out with him.  sure it's plausible but I try not to think about it that way."  Self :  "You know, that's probably it!  She met someone new and didn't want to cheat on two people in the same year!"  Gonzo : "I don't know for sure, whatever.  She doesn't owe me anything, she can do whatever she wants.  nothing I can do now right?"  Self :  "Well laddy freakin' da.  He is back!  Gonzo : "Huh?"  Self :  "There you are taking everything with a grain of salt"  Gonzo : "Oh yeah, well you know how I am, once I let someone in, I'm like a damn marshmallow.  the closer people are the easier it is to hurt me."  Self :  "I know, I know you!  So what's next?  Gonzo : "Well I'm sick of the whole bar thing, maybe I'll try out the library.  I'll go check out and meet girls there or the grocery store, blockbuster wherever!  Hmm, what about online personal ads?  I might check that shit out.  That could be the ultimate experiment!  hehe.  not sure if I want to pay for that shit though.  In the mean time, I'm going to go do things that I used to do.  Basketball, darts, go out with friends till early morning.  Let myself get back into a routine.  It's going to be all good."  Self :  "online?  I would suggest staying away from those.  It's all freaks and geeks up in there!"  Gonzo : "Did you say 'freaks and geeks'?"  Self :  "Yeah..."  Gonzo : "Cute ones?"  Self :  "I don't know, I never checked that shit out!"  Gonzo : "Well there's always a first time!!!  HAHAHA"  Self :  "Oh deal..."    Yeah, I had a lenghty conversation with myself before falling asleep last night.  I'm not quite sure how to start the  personals ad.  any suggestions?  I'm not looking for love, just friends or someone to date, I dunno.  Fuck love for now.  I'm sure that's going to be there later.  I'm just going to go have fun.  Yeah, I'm pretty bored here at work.  I can recollect most of the conversation from last night.  Yikes, an I turning  neurotic?  MWAH HAH HAHA   p.s.  Sorry for the lack of any real posts here.  It should be over soon.  Things will be back to normal here, no more bullshit about the past relationship.  Just a little bit more and we will return to other things.  Thanks!
