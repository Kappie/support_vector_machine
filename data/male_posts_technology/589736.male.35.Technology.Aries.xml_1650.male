But I've also had some positive experiences. I'd say that dating is both what you make it and always an adventure. And as someone who has been on both sides of single  married, I'd have to say that I'm currently enjoying the dating gambit. If you ask me again in six months I may change my mind....  In other news, the New York Times' Ben Brantley has re-reviewed "Nine: the Musical." If you're a subscriber, go to: http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/29/arts/theater/29NINE.html It seems that we'll be open through at least January; it's a rave. Thankfully.
