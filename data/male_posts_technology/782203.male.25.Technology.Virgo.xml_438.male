Anyway got pretty much trashed despite my attempts at distracting my friend with my between-the-legs dribbles and sky hooks, I guess they can only invoke so much laughter before they wear off. But hell it was still fun to work out a sweat after such a long long time. Gonna be doing it tommorow morning again.
