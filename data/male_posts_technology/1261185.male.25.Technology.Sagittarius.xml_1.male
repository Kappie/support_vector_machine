At the beginning of this bad-ass Japanese flick about a government sanctioned free-for-all killing spree between the members of a single Japanese 9th grade class, they announce the winner as a young, bloody, girl.  And yet at the end they announce the winner as a boy!  Maybe I missed something here butI don't think I did.  If some one would please explain this to me I would appreciate it. Just post a comment, notlike anybody is actually reading this.    On a lighter note my co-worker Dennis and his wife Rhonda gave Courtney and I one of our first baby shower presents.  Thanks to them soo much for all the great stuff.  Peace.
