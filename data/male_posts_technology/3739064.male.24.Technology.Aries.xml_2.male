I keep getting discouraged around step 3 or 4 and then stumble around like a drunken fool until I pass out and wake up when I'm 40 and not content with my career choices. Sooo how will I fix this....hmmm....Well after thinking about I realized all the first steps were all wrong. I wanted to take a step but I had no clue where I was going. So for the record, I need and idea. Next I need a Plan. Next I need support. Next I need to design. Next I need to develop. Next i need to Test. Next I need to Deploy/Sell.  If you havent figured it out yet, my goals are to go into business for myself in the software business. I'm tired of my boss renting me out at 100$ /hr and i see a small fraction of that.  So, here I go back to step one.
