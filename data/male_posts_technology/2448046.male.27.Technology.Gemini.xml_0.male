I don't find words to describe the intensity of the song, but can't help keeping myself awed by it's eternal beauty!  ----- I'm Standing on a bridge  I'm waitin in the dark  I thought that you'd be here by now  Theres nothing but the rain  No footsteps on the ground  I'm listening but theres no sound   Isn't anyone tryin to find me?  Won't somebody come take me home  It's a damn cold night  Trying to figure out this life  Wont you take me by the hand  take me somewhere new  I dont know who you are  but I'm, I'm with you  I'm with you  im looking for a place  i'm searching for a face  is anybody here i know  cause nothings going right  and everythings a mess  and no one likes to be alone   Isn't anyone tryin to find me?  Won't somebody come take me home  It's a damn cold night  Trying to figure out this life  Wont you take me by the hand  take me somewhere new  I dont know who you are  but I'm, I'm with you  I'm with you oh why is everything so confusing  maybe I'm just out of my mind  yea yea yea   It's a damn cold night  Trying to figure out this life  Wont you take me by the hand  take me somewhere new  I dont know who you are  but I'm, I'm with you  I'm with you  Take me by the hand  take me somewhere new  I dont know who you are  but I'm, I'm with you I'm with you  Take me by the hand  take me somewhere new  I dont know who you are  but I'm, I'm with you (oh) I'm with you I'm with you... -----
