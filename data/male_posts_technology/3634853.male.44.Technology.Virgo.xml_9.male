It's been a long time since I had the feeling, but from the very start, although I didn't see my first hand for a while I felt like I was dominating the tables I was on.  I don't think after I made my first move with KK to a rag flop that I was ever truly threatened.  I came at any pot I wanted to play strongly and normally didn't get much action but it allowed me to steal some blinds and get to a position where I stayed just as aggressive as I thought I needed to stay in control.  The only real trouble I had was with the guy I ended up Heads up with as he was very careful and wouldn't put his chips at risk and he was only behind me by about T2500 chips.  I decided the only way I was going to get him was to try and trap, and eventually got my chance, slow played a flopped straight, and knocked him out.  After that win I found another tourney and registered but really never caught any cards.  I ended up in the middle of the pack, but did so only by being very patient, but finally got to a point where I had to make a stand and pushed all in with QQ and got caught by AA.  I took quite a break through the middle of the afternoon. Partly because of Father's Day but as I started thinking about it, also because I wanted to protect my win for the day.  That's probably not the best thinking all the time, but at this early stage of the building of my bankroll, I was able to justify it.  Anyway, after dinner I decided to try a Multi tourney at UltimnateBet.  The entry was only $5 so I wasn't risking a lot, but had potential to make a big hit if I got some cards.  On top of that, UB hasn't been very good to me lately and I'm just not running very confident there, so I thought this might be a good time to try to shake the cobwebs.  I ended up placing 53rd out of 656.  It only netted me $2.70 so my BB/hour rate won't be skyrocketing, but it was nice to at least finish in the money.  I truly have no idea how I lasted as long as I did.  At one point I had been moved to a table and only saw one flop in 48 hands!  That was the last before they moved me and it turned out to be a blind steal, but it certainly tested my patience.  Anyway, I remained patient and eventually got a couple of hands, was able to make them stand up and doubled up at least enough to get into the money.  I ended up getting busted out with AKs and a Kxx flop, when pocket QQ's caught a straight with runner runner.  Such is life :)  Anyway, I've gotten myself back over the hump and am feeling somewhat confident, although I want to guard against being cocky.  I may have also shook the UB feelings of late so this day could have had more positives than at first glance.  I guess we'll see.  Until tomorrow......
