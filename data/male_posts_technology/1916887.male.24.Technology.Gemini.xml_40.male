I've tested a free (everything I use is free or close to it) program that schedules defrags called AutoDeFrag but I've had a few problems with it (at least in my test environment).  In my quest to find the (free) solution to my defrag needs, I've come across 3 scripts that can be scheduled to automate Win2000 defrag:   urlLink myITforum.com : Clean Temporary Files and Run Defrag    urlLink myITforum.com : Automating Defrag    urlLink myITforum.com : Defragment All Hard Drives
