Hell I got gal friends who look better than most of the final 20. And this malay chick who was one of the prettier ones didn't even make it to the top 20! Hmm I wonder if color is part of the judging criteria.   I woke up today with a horrible stomach upset; you know the type that gets you all naseous and break out in goose pimples. Took two long trips to the toilet in the morning and basically felt like crap the whole day. Sigh I knew i ate too much at the wedding...
