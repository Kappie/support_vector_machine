My eyes are dry less often, the acuity is still there (20/15), closeup vision has improved (or I'm getting used to being a normal 40-year-old with the beginnings of presbyopia). I think the fuzziness around lights at night has gotten slightly better, and remember that it wasn't that bad to start with. I'm still quite happy with the results, and I'm starting to take the ability to see without correction for granted.  So, how about all this gay marriage stuff? Quite something, huh? In an online news article Senate Majority Leader Frist is quoted as saying, "Same sex marriage is likely to spread through all 50 states in the coming years. It is becoming increasingly clear that Congress must act." He's advocating an amendment to the U.S. constitution defining marriage as being between one man and one woman. But I get excited by his feeling that there's a trend to perform gay marriages. Portland, Oregon just started today. I once saw someone liken it to the Israelis occupying the West Bank -- controversial, ostensibly illegal, but the more people are there, the harder it is to get them back out. Once there are thousands of gay couples -- tens of thousands -- hundreds? -- considering themselves legally married, the prospect of trying to invalidate all of them becomes daunting. Scary for opponents to same-sex marriage, and certainly a thought lending urgency to their agenda. My views? C'mon -- an amendment to the constitution? To define marriage? Silly. I'm all for the definition of civil marriage to include any two people of an appropriate age. I don't see any downside whatsoever. Undermine the institution of family? I don't think so.
