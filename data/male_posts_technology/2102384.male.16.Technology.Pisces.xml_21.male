On our home wireless firewall we have MAC address restriciton and a DHCP setup.  Both of these would have to be turned off to allow outsiders (and you) to access your LAN and anonymously use it.  This would allow people to ruin your bandwidth; plus I doubt the authorities would believe that you didn't know what you were doing.
