She's retired now and does voluntary work and she was incredibly surprised and delighted to see me (it might have been the purple hair). I was incredibly polite and nice as i always was to her (even though she hated me - i used to answer her back but not in a rude way. it was more of a bemused, inquisitive way) and i think she quite enjoyed the chance meeting. still, it was a strange coincidence but strangely things like this no longer freak me out.. coincidences like this are bound to happen occasionally. the burning question on whether she was still having an affair with Mr Evans (it'd been going 20 years or so) remained unanswered.. But he obviously never made an honest woman of her though :(
