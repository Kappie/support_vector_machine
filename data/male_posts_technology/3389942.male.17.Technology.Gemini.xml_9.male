On a topic totally unrelated to me not finishing my anthro summative, I had Sarah over yesterday. ^^'. It was fun, we watched tons of south park [all season 8].  ummm... My physics summative is due Friday, my Programming summative is due Friday, my Computer Engineering summative is... tomorrow, its a test.  umm...  I work tonight, for 3 hours [yay for $21!], I shouldn't complain, I need the money.  anyway, --Grant
