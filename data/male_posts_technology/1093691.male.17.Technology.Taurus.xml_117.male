It is BBC Choice replacement, it has a couple of the programmes like Liquid News and 60 Seconds from BBC Choice, but also quite a few new programmes. It is 90% British made programming.  Also Max if we ski, we all ski together. Ski school is in the morning and afternoon, and if you want to you can ski after that for a little while. The slopes are 30 minute drive from the hotel. I have got 1 dodgy double audio jack and I am trying to buy another one.  Don't you ever get bored of watching The Office?  Jackie, nothing is going to happen unless you talk to somebody about it.
