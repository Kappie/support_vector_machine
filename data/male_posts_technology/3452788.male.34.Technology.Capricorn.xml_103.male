According to  urlLink an article  in GeoTimes, the magazine of the American Geological Institute:    "...analysts point out that while gas prices are higher than ever before, when adjusted for inflation, the true price of gasoline at the pump has fallen more than 40 percent from its peak of $2.77 per gallon in 1981."    OK, but it's still cheaper in Oregon.
