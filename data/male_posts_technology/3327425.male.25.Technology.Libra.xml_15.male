That phrase was taken from a Saturday Night Live sketch in which two Schwarzenegger-worshiping body builders referred to ANYONE who was weak as a "girlie man."   This comment has democrats fuming claiming that Schwarzenegger is resorting to "blatant homophobia." And that the term is derogatory to women. Okay...sooooo...where was the problem when Hans and Frans were using it on SNL? Hmmm....hit a little close to home did we Mr. Democrat?
