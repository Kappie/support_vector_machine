       
      I'm a bus rider.  I like not having to worry about parking, traffic, stupid drivers, etc.  I like having time to just sit on the way to work, read a book or magazine, what have you.    But one thing I can't stand is (I'm sure you've guessed it) rude people.    There's not a lot of room on a bus - they try to make them fit as many people as possible, for obvious reasons.  So when I'm sitting in an outside seat and I have to get off, the person sitting on the inside seat should stand up and get out of the way so I can do so, right?    Apparently not.  Too often I get stuck with that person who just pulls their knees up or scoots to the side.  I'm tempted to brush my ass in their face as I go by sometimes, just so they get the idea.
