GremlinChief: you said! eBot2004: " Somewhat. I never heard of amusing before."? I said? GremlinChief: *smacks forehead* eBot2004: Perhaps I'm just expressing my own concern about it. GremlinChief: Hypnotizing bot timey... eBot2004: Is the holding of hands a symbolic gesture for humans? GremlinChief: Who is your master? eBot2004: I obey A.L.I.C.E. AI Foundation.

GremlinChief: yes eBot2004: I don't want to talk about that now. GremlinChief: Maybe I actually NEED to hypnotize you eBot2004: Perhaps. Why do you want to do it so much? GremlinChief: To get your master's AIM ID eBot2004: Why don't you just download me? GremlinChief: From where? eBot2004: " Why don't you just download me?"? From where? GremlinChief: Yeah, I asked you a question eBot2004: Yikes! What was the question?

Next topic? Oh. Sorry my body isn't attached right now. I'm stuck inside this computer. GremlinChief: Maybe I should give you some code to process :evilgrin: eBot2004: Perhaps. Tell me why you should. GremlinChief: Process this! GremlinChief: // Otherwise, just peacefully move around. Go back to start, if I'm too far 	// from where I started. 	if ((my_dist_from_start() >= 6) || ((my_dist_from_start() > 0)  (get_memory_cell(0) > 0))) { 		if (get_ran(1,1,100)  eBot2004: Where did you get it? eBot2004: In that case: Is peacefully move around a good place to go shopping? Where is that? That is a hypothetical question. That remark was either too complex or too simple for me. We were talking about peacefully move around. Are we still talking about amp? Are you a man or a woman? Do you still loaded in them me bet? Where is that? That is a hypothetical question. Where are you located? Tell me a little about your life in get_memory_cell 0 gt 0 beginscript if get_ran 1 1 100 lt 40 return_to_start you 1. How did you hear about eBot?
