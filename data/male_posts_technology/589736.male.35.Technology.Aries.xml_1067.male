I'm not convinced this is a good thing -- if iTunes crashes because of Windows issues, then Apple looks bad, not MS -- but it should be interesting to find out if this is the corporate pale shadow phoenix that rises from Napster's ashes.  By the by -- iPods have also been updated, and I think there will be Windows-compatible versions of those, as well.  Re architecture:  There are several websites dedicated to reconfiguring a Mac to run Linux.  Wonder if Linux will always be an underground, back-door movement.  Not sure what the benefit is of running Linux on a Mac vs. a PC -- maybe it's a cool factor, being in a different box.
