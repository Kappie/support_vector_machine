Combustible rubbish read to the torch of any one  ambitious to illuminate his name.   In Dr. Johnson's famous dictionary patriotism is defined as the  last resort of a scoundrel.  With all due respect to an enlightened  but inferior lexicographer I beg to submit that it is the first."       -Ambrose Bierce Another quote from  urlLink Gutenberg .
