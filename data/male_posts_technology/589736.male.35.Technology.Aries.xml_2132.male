While it is Mel Gibson's right to create a film with his own artistic vision, it then comes down to whether the film is being done with a heavy influence of historical accuracy OR simply being made from ones own interpretation of an event.  This picture seems to be made as the latter.  And like Harmonium said, I don't have a problem with that.  But you can't also try and market that same product as being historically accurate, when it just isn't.....if indeed that is what is being done.
