       IBS Pasta Salad 

    

    

       Belching 

       Burning in "ulcer zone", relieve with belching 

    

     

 

 

 I created an Italian pasta salad from my "Eating for IBS" book.  It is pretty good, although I think a whole clove of garlic is a bit much and I may have been a bit heavy on the basil as well.  It seems very healthy though.  I think I'll have a glass of the fennel or chamomile tea before bed.  I'm hopeful that this will help me! 

 I have to say that I didn't realize how much I missed cooking.  I haven't been spending much time in the kitchen lately for obvious reasons.  Even if this salad I made tonight doesn't sit well, I was glad to be cooking again.  It really makes me happy to be in the kitchen. 

  Update:  and an unfortunate one at that.  Only 6 minutes into eating a very tiny bowl of this salad and I'm experiencing an acute burning in the "ulcer zone" - the area just below my sternum.  Is this the duodenum?  Anyway, it burns and is relieved somewhat by belching.  The salad is made with the juice of two lemons, go figure that would upset my stomach.  I knew that it would, but I'm more interested in how my intestines react to the salad.  I'm foolish to eat something with that much citric acid in it.  I'll try a different recipe tomorrow.
