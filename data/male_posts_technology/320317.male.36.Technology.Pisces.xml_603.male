No matter how sophisticated our back ends get, the front ends seem to remain stagnant. Yes, HTML transformed to XHTML, but that is such a small step and it is a problematic one when we consider the still eminent requirement of multi-browser, multi-platform, multi-device support."

 The idea that "users are demanding more and more richness" sounds like a Macromedia employee promoting Flash. Who are these users? If anything they are demanding simplicity and easy to understand user interfaces. I guess it really depends on how you define "richness", but if it adds more complexity from a users point of view, I think you are just adding to the confusion and frustration. I don't care what the technology is on the front end, it has to be simple and easy to understand on a moments notice.
