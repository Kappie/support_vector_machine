I like getting change when I pay for something... but can change only come from paying something, exchanging it for something of value.. for something that less? Yes that was a little abstract, but sometimes it feels like that, that you give up to much of yourself to change into something else. The potential of the change could be large though, but it could be a dud and come short and you lose more than you gain.  I have had a recent experience of that sort of nature. It is highly personal, and not something that I want to post publicly, but it has stimulated some random thoughts.  I didn't really think certain... feelings or desires could be changed. However, they have. The change was catalyzed by putting myself back into the situation that invokes certain attitudes and responses that I was sure were unchangeable. I guess not, and I guess it wasn't so much a radical change as an evolution of an understanding of my own motivations for my feelings. The stimuli for my previous motivations were removed, and that stimuli was NEVER in my control. That stimuli, sad but true, was at its basic, was hope. Now do not worry, I am not talking about hope in life or anything like that.. just in one thing that was important.  You know what, it was not so traumatic to lose that hope as I thought. It is.... peaceful. I feel a little empty, but now I can move on from something that was holding me back from evolving into a different direction. Not worst, I don't know if better, but different.. change... is change good?
