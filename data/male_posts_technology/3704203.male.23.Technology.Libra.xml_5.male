I am in awe or how people can look at a clearly biased "documentary" like this and draw any reasonable conclusion other than Michael Moore is a total leftist idiot.  Further, the man is anti-american in the worst possible way, he spews forth anti-american rhetoric any chance he gets.  Granted, he is entitled to do so, in fact, he is protected by the very consitution of the country that he rails against when overseas.  As the saying goes, the cuffs dont match the collar-  the man is a crum bum, end of story.
