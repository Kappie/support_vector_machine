Thanks.' - 6/3/2004 04:17:22 PM 'Max could you blog please.' - 6/5/2004 08:16:51 PM  Secondly,  I do NOT need to relax, i am perfectly relaxed, and most of all, I don’t need you telling me to relax.  Thirdly,  Me and Tom do NOT clash, we are actually good friends, and just sometimes joke around having a go at each others posts, i have spoken to him and neither of us are actually offended by anything each other say. Fourthly, if you are going to attack me so publicly, use real words 'onvious'???  And Finally , I am not bitchy, nor will i ever be.  And to think the main reason i came on here this evening was to write nice things and compliment you on your art/textiles display.   If you have any further problem with me, i will not hesitate in leaving. I am sorry it has come to this nicki, maybe next time you could speak to me or something controversial like that.     Well despite that little annoyance i am actually very happy today, have had a good day, i hope everyone else is good too. See you all soon. Dave
