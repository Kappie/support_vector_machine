We found a little bit of everything; wrens in a couple boxes, tree swallows in others, and even some bluebirds! Most of the nests had eggs or chicks in them - it is the prime nesting season for most song birds.   One of the tree swallows was calm enough that we were able to pick her up off the nest and hold her. She was not thrilled with being handled but we were successful in getting her back on the nest without incident.   Need to create a little log of the boxes, conditions, and nests. One more thing for the web site!
