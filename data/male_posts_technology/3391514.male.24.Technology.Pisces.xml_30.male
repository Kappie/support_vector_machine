It has been delayed as the players are  somewhat unreliable .  Actually, thats a gross understatement.   Ninety Percent Unreliable  is a better way or putting it.  The game was good, as it has been for the past 10 years, with one player screwing up his charcters life in an amusing fashion, and the other trying to pick up the pieces.  Sadly, the first player always begins to "feel tired" and "has to be up early" the next morning, and thus the game invariably ends abruptly.  Today hasn't been very exciting really... I caught up with a few people I haven't talked to in a while, and also took another step toward securing additional finances.  I'm in the process of trying to order  "Armour"  by Jon Steakley.  Ottakars have been surprisingly inept at doing this, especially considering the speed at which they got a copy of  Starship Troopers  and one of the Warcraft novels in for me.  The book itself is apparently in the mold of Heinlein's classic... I can only hope it is true.  Yesterday morning, I finished reading  Transformers: Fusion .  It looks like  The Forever War  is going to be the 'reading successor'.  I'm really interested in the whole "future war with battlesuits" concept at the moment.  Oddly enough, the above GURPS game is kinda like that... coincidence?    Nah.
