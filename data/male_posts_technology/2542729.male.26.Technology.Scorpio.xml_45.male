Her name was Latasha B. and for a lil' young kat that was already infatuated with red bones, she was the total package. Cute, pretty  quiet (I tend to be attracted to quiet types). I figure I must have been in maybe the 5th or 6th grade because I definitely wasn't in high school by then. My older cousin Stacy was actually the one that gave it to her. On this particular day, the object of my premature affection happened to be first on the bus. She dropped it off to Tasha then we both went to the back seats and hid. The following moments are ones I will never forget. Shortly after reading a few lines, she began tearing up the paper! To myself I was thinking..."why is she doing that???" It took so long to write, and it had so many of my innocent pre-teen feelings in it and....WHY IS SHE TEARING IT UP??? :(( My other cousin Freda B. was sitting on her same seat. A combination of curiosity and a desire to have Tasha respect the good intentions of the guy who wrote it helped her read the rest of the letter. It was the first time I ever saw a girl cry! Sigh if only they were only tears of joy.... After my crappy attempt at love was literally destroyed, I began to think of what I did wrong. First, and most importantly, you never say something like "you so fyne, you fyner than your mama!!" Instant turn off...I learned the hard way. Much of the letter was like that, and I believe somewhere in that offensive letter was a little boy trying to express his emotions the best way he could...I just couldn't prove it.  That's where I learned what was apropriate to tell a woman and what not to. It was the beginning of a long, painful journey, one that for a while, shyed me away from trynna holla at females.  Its kinda funny when I think back on it. My thinking was so linear. There was but one purpose in my early going and that was to get the heck outta Calhoun Falls. Prestige, cliques, sports...all that meant nada to me. Well, until senior year. That was a coming out year of sorts. I tried out and made the football team for the first time, even tried out for basketball (didn't make the squad). Made records in track and only got one at bat in baseball. In the end, during my entire elementary  high school career, I never had a true girlfriend. I used to think that was a magnificent drawback but looking back on my short past, every defeat ended up benefiting me in some way later in life.  There is a picture being painted and i'm not exactly sure what the final product will be. What I know is that i've had a really non-typical dating life. By the grace of God, i've been thru many situations. I've dealt with pregnant women, needy women, an endless stream of shady women...confronted a sea of personalities head on and in every circumstance, for good or for ill, I came out stronger. It all prepared me for the next adventure in my life. To have and to pursue such a prophecy as was given when I met Nicole...it reminds me of what it takes for prophetic blessings to pass: all parties must be willing. I believe in the power of the works of God in our lives. All my method and general intuition has been led by a power that I cannot fathom. This saying the old people use, about "if God brings you to it, he'll bring u through it", it applies unconditionally. If by some stroke of misfortune Nicole and I happen to not fully be able to reconcile our differences, i'm confident that God will bless anyhow.  ...and let's be clear on one thing, i'm not looking for a replacement at this time! Love is a serious word with me and I feel in my heart of hearts that the story of Nikki  Ron isn't over yet. There is a book filled with pages that beg to be filled. Even tonite, we've taken some steps to strengthen the friendship. How the future will fare is anyone's guess. Of course i'm a realist (I can be, seriously!) and I realize there's a chance we may never hook back up again. But such is the risk that you take. You have to let people go, experience their own thing. Cause its only by letting something free that you can tell if they truly love you or not. Its kinda backwards tho...cause if anybody needed time, it really wasn't me. I admittedly wasn't prepared at first, what with the well documented obstacles we've dealt with but I got that way. So forgive me if I feel kinda naked. :p I been standing out on this ledge by myself for a minute now...  I had some more rants to post but its already 2:43 and i'm sure this stuff needs editing but crap i'll fix it next post or so. *yawn* i'll holla.
