Everyone  knows her music is a farce, even her fans for sweet fucking Mary-Lou Stevenson's sake. But, as usual, some folks just aren't willing to let the honest-to-god FACT that she can't sing worth shit hinder their views that , yes, Ms. Spears is a wonderfully fucking talented little tart. You know, you hit a point where you just stop trying to hammer some sense into peoples' heads. I'm not saying everyone should go listen to Slipknot. I just wish with all my heart and what's left of my soul, that people would begin to think for themselves , that they'd make up their own opinions instead of buying into all the hype and peer-ravings. It's like the whole Linux vs Windows thing (another topic that just won't fucking die). People who never even  used  Linux will go on and on about how absolutely goddamn good it is, stable fast, etc etc... the same shit we 'Windoze Lusers' have heard a million times before. Christ people, could you think  outside  the box for a second? If Linux does what YOU want it to do for you , then yippee-ki-yay, good for you. But casually dismissing hundreds of thousands of Windows users as 'idiots' for using an OS that meets their needs and satisfies their desires , is just plain stupid, in the stupidest fucking way possible. I'll tell you a little secret. Linux users secretly all have penis envy. Big American Penis envy. And to all those people bitching about blue screens as an excuse to move over to Linux. There's a NEW version of Windows out! Yes, it's amazing! It's called WindowsXP! In fact, you probably missed the last version of the Windows OS that came out as well. Windows 2000. I've been using it for a year now and have YET to experience this dreaded BSOD on Win2K. I mean , what the fuck, 98SE is going on 4 years old now. Do you see Linux users out there running 4 year old versions of their OS? No? Then bitching about 98's stability today is a moot point. Times have changed. You have to move with them.
