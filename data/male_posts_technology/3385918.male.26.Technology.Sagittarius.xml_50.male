Like I've said before, I never buy the PPVs. I wait for them on DVD and then decide if I want to buy them or not. I've totally ignored the last few PPV cause of the reviews they've been getting. If I am going to buy something, I have to make sure I am making a good investment. Smackdown's PPV (especially Judgement Day) are most definitely not a good investment. Which is sad, cause a year ago, I would gladly purchase a Smackdown DVD before I did a RAW DVD. Times have really changed.  Would I buy this PPV on DVD? Well, let's analyze the results.  We started off the night with La Resistance (World Tag Team Champions) vs. "The Crippler" Chris Benoit  Edge. From what I hear, it was your standard RAW match, which is sad cause the team of La Resistance really needed to be hot here. There was some teasing in relation to the possible Edge VS. Benoit feud, but it was mostly all bullshit cause eventually Kain interfered, causing a DQ ending which does shit for everyone. The only thing I see here is that this was mostly done to set up the match later with Benoit and Kain. I have a feeling that the WWE might also be thinking of using this loss to set up a feud between Edge and Kain for the next PPV. Might be a smart thing, considering that the rumors Edge heal turn is something so absurd, only the twisted, retarded minds of the writers of the WWE could come up with it. No kidding, it's a bad idea. Edge is an establish wrestler, but he isn't ready to go heal yet. Heck, his fans are not ready no see him turn heel yet. Such a thing can alienate a lot of people from the WWE.   Next up was Jericho vs. Tomko. Now, I've said this was an important match mostly because it was Tomko's first official match in the WWE. This is where we get to really know what type of wrestler Tomko is. Because of that, it's important for the wrestler and the WWE to make sure that he is introduced in a good way, as to make him a credible character. Was it a good match? Well, apparently no. The WWE dropped the ball yet again. Sure, some people mention that the debut of Tomko was much better than the debut of Mordechai on Smackdown. Still, that ain't saying much given that Mordechai beat his opponent really quickly.   Apparently, it was a normal match and, guess what, Jericho won! Now, people, please. Jericho's win does nothing for Tomko. Also, it was a short match. Should have been longer and, maybe, a DQ Finnish. A loss here, no matter how it was achieved, only hurts Tomko as a credible Wrestler. Not a good start.  Until now, the WWE has really dropped the ball for this PPV. Now, the next match sounded like it was pretty good, but this was something I was saying early last week.   Orton vs. Benjamin... This match had to deliver. Both of these guys need a classic match to put themselves in the main even scene. From what I hear, it was a pretty good match. Heck, a few people have even had the balls to call it the match of the night (totally ignoring the 40 + minute HIAC match). Was it a classic? No way. Is this a bad thing? Actually, no. In fact, it was probably a very wise idea once you take the time and think about it. First of all, everybody taught that Orton would loose tonight cause that would then have him move to feud for the World Heavyweight title (possible against Edge, Kain or even HHH before feuding with Benoit or who ever is the champion at that moment). Well, Randy won, so he gets the keep the title a while longer. This is a clear guaranty that this feud will be extended a few more months, which means that there will be time for both Orton and Benjamin to really make this a great feud and build for a climactic ending. This is much better and works to set both of them up for the main event.  I've liked Randy Orton's recent storylines. They have all helped him become more of a credible wrestler. These feuds have lasted very long, but have had interesting endings which, in turn, have given the IC title some prestige. A longer, more aggressive feud between these two young talent would be golden.  This match, apparently, had a few blown spots which people didn't like. Possibly cause both participates where nervous. I would be too. This, like Tomko's match with Jericho, are key matches that make or break a wrestler's career in the WWE. While flawed, it did its job and created interest in a longer, more exciting match. SummerSlam, anyone?  Now, here is where we go back to being a shitty program. The Women's four-way... Look, I didn't see the match, so I can't bitch about the quality of it. I can only talk about the ending with Trish winning the title. WTF??? Her appearance in the match was an after taught. It didn't make sense in the first place to be added here. This should have been a match between Gail Kim and Victoria. The WWE had built up Gail Kim really, really well. But their weakness was Victoria. Not Victoria's fault. They didn't find a way to develop her and her feud with Gail Kim in a competent way on RAW. Which is probably why they started adding more pussy to the match. Look, just because you don't know how to develop a story, doesn't mean you have to shit on probably two of the best female wrestlers on your roster. It's just plain stupid.  Anyway, Trish wins because... actually, I don't know why. It's a mystery. Did Trish's storyline really needed her to win this title? I mean, there was some build up for Lita to win to add something to her bizarre storyline with Kain. A win for Lita here and a loss for Kain tonight would have probably made more sense, even taught I would still be mad cause that would make a fool out of Victoria and Gail Kim, who should be fighting for this title.   Who is Trish going to feud for the title? Hopefully, Gail Kim and Victoria. Trish is probably one of the most consistent female wrestlers among the group (well, no. Molly is, but she has seemed to drop out of radar). But Trish is a heel now. And the WWE seems to have something against having heels feud with heels. So, that leaves only Lita, Victoria and Nydia (who seems to have vanished from the face of the earth) to feud here. What a mess? Well, looks like Lita VS Kain (with Kain as guest referee) for Summer Slam.   Actually, come to think of it, this might actually be an interesting match if everybody who has been involved in with the storylines for these two get involve. Would be funny to see Lita beat the crap out of each other, with Kain as referee having to contend with Christian, Tomko, Jericho and Matt Hardy trying to get involved in the match.   Then again, maybe not.   Next was Eugene vs. Coachman. I started reading what went down in this match. Funny stuff. Looks like the WWE is actually pulling this gimmick off like a bandit. It's working. It's actually working!!! Weird!!! Bad gimmick working. I should start preparing for the end of the world.  what's the trick here? I'd go with the fact that the guy who plays the "Eugene" character is really doing a good job at acting out the part. The crowd seems to love the character. Heck, they even chant his name!!!  There must be a lot of guys scratching their heads in the back about this.  Coach sounds like he helped make this match a fun match. People hate the Coach. Incredible. He has really made himself into a funny and interesting heel. This guy is pulling of his character very well and it being rewarded with more appearances. Hell, he's earned it.  Eugene wins. Weeeeeee !!!  Now, for the two main events.  Benoit vs. Kane seemed to be better than people expected. Actually received some nice reviews. I feel like Kain has the potential to do much better than what is being handed to him. This is proof of it. Benoit wins.   Now, boys and girls... what you all have been waiting for. A nice, sweet stroll... INTO HELL !!! Yep, it's Hell in a Cell, baby !!! And, from what I hear, it was a blood bath. Yeah, baby !!! I expected no less from these guys. They had to deliver here with all the hype. Did they do it? Well, they sure bleed a lot. Some say it was disappointing. Others say it was good, but not the best HIAC by a long shot. One things for sure, both participants beat the crap out of each other. There was a lot of intensity in the bout. Which is something both these guys generate even in their sleep. I think that the main complaint is that this isn't something we've never seen from these guys before. It's a classic back and forth beating until both wrestlers are dead or dying. All of their matches are like this. Nothing new to the formula, except the HIAC gimmick and, apparently, they focused more on the classic back and forth beating than covering new, innovative techniques using the cell.   Maybe it's best. Both of these guys are have been fighting with intensity with horrible nagging injuries. Hell, Shawn Michaels has a bad back that was considered a career ending injury a few years back. These two guys really are the best of the best and, once again, they proved it. But maybe the act is getting a little old for these battling giants. Still, I have no doubt that this was one hell of the match and, at 45 minutes, it had to be.   The only bad part about this being a long match is that it took time away from several matches that could have used those extra minutes to develop a better story inside the ring.  HHH won, there by assuring another one of his "I'm the best" rants tonight on RAW. *sigh*  Well, that was the show. It wasn't a total loss. From what I've read, it seems that it was a much better show than Smackdown's Judgement Day PPV (which isn't saying much). Sounds like the live crowd loved the show, even taught some reviewers claim that the audience came out as dead on TV. Some people that where actually live there claim that this is totally untrue. I have a feeling that the crowd was indeed hot. It was a good card and people knew it (even taught the WWE managed to fuck several things up that probably hurt a little the mood of the crowd).  Anyway, I'd say I am most definitely buying this PPV when it gets to DVD, which is probably one of the highest compliments I can give the WWE. Like I said before, if it seems like a bad investment, then I will totally ignore the product.   Let's see if tonight the WWE can pull off a good RAW. Bad Blood was pretty hot and there were a few matches that have potential to carry over a lot of story into tonight's show. Hell, I would want to know where the fuck the WWE thinks it's going with the Trish winning the title thing. It's so stupid, I actually want to find out. Only time will tell. Also, what the hell are they gonna do now that Lita and Kain both loss. Where will they go now? Preferably to hell, but I think that would be asking too much. Also, maybe Eugene can start feuding with Garrison Cade tonight. I don't expect to see Shawn Michaels cause he has to sell the beating he received at Bad Blood, plus he has to take some time off to be with family. I do expect HHH to talk, talk, talk, talk and talk some more until the cows come home. Tonight we will probably see more about the rumored Edge VS. Well, just have to see.   See ya tomorrow for another RAW review ;)   urlLink Sailor Ecchi
