Some friends had given gift vouchers for  Landmark  and  Westside , so it was time to redeem them before they would become invalid. Kalpana was busy getting goodies for herself and some cute things for the house. Poor me, she did not buy me anything. Anyhow, once all the shopping was done, it was time to hog and the perfect place for a quick bite was " Transit ", the food court at  The Forum .  This place is awesome, the look and feel gives you an impression as if you are in some Bond movie, the food is not bad either. This time though we had a bite of the Thai food at the " Panda Club ".  Chicken Satay , kind of a Thai version of Chicken Tandoori though the size was a hundred times smaller. I had a Thai combo non-veggie meal while Kalpana went for the Vietnamese Combo veg meal which she did not like one bit. So, I had to swap my plate with her in the anticipation that she does not throw up. What can I say, she has peculiar tastes :) But I had a good time and I really feel the food court is done well, a thousand times better than the one at Kemp Fort.  Highly recommended for a change.
