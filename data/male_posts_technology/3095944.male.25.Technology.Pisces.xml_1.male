Mobydock is an app launcher that emulates Mac's OS X dock. Yes, that cool icon bar usually at the bottom of the screen that gets animated when you mouse over them. It's way cool and people who see it for the first time will surely ask where you got the nifty tool. You can tell them you got it from  urlLink Mobydock . Best of all, it's free!  You can actually hide your Windows taskbar using Mobydock but it's not a complete taskbar replacement. Those of you who use lot of applications may be looking for a way to put your Start button on your Mobydock. You can always put the Start Menu Folder on it but when clicked, it will just open the folder. No cool looking drop-down lists.  Give it a shot!   urlLink http://www.mobydock.com/   Screenie to whet your appetite:    Footnotes: Mobydock only works on Windows 2000 and XP and requires DirectX 9.
