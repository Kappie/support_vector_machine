Anyway the Starbucks guy recognised me as a regular customer and knew I was going to order a hot chocolate with cream. He gave me a stamp card for future visits. Considering there has been atleast 1000 people enter starbucks since my last visit this guy has an exceptional memory or he is stalking me.  Ben "Polar Bear" Davies at Starbucks.
