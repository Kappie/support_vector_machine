We spent a good hour just talking about stuff, but the short answer is, it takes a lot, but less than you may think.  What I learned was it will take about 18 months to get to the point where I can reasonable expect someone to pay me to drive their expensive taxi around the sky, less than I thought.  It will cost around $35k to get there, more than I hoped.  Now, my passengers would be of the create-and-barrel kind, but at least I wouldn’t have to hand out peanuts.  The money thing is kinda daunting, that’s a lot of greenbacks.  But as it turns out you can get loans much like student loans from college.  The company recommended to me has decent interest rates that are actually tied to the British prime rate, so Mr. Greenspan can’t mess with me much.  All and all I’m not sure where this will lead right now.  I’m still doing my homework while I decide if I want to take the BMW sized plunge.  Like a good geek I did go strait out and get a copy of MS Flight Sim 2004.  Not sure if it will help or not, but how often can you justify a new game as a Life Change Exploration Tool.
