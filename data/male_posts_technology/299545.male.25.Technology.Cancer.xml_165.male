Since Reagan's death Saturday, Bush has repeatedly offered glowing praise of the 40th president in ways that echo his own reelection efforts, but were not overtly political.   urlLink This  is really starting to smell bad to me. Pay tribute to the man, but don't take advantage of his legacy. In the unlikely event that the  urlLink other side  did something similar, I would say the same thing.
