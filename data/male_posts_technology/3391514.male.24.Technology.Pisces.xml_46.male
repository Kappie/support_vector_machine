Today was that diceless RPG with a conspiracy theme... isn't going well thanks to one of the players being and arse and another playing one.  Additionally, there was more Fallout 2.  Or more accurately, a repeat of such.  I decided my leveling up and Perk selection was a poor choice... so I went back to my closest save and did it all again... of which there was a lot.  The crowning achievement was killing the Rat God in a single aimed headshot with a shotgun... not an easy feat when you're a close combat expert.  I've also become far more averse to my god-damn eyedrops.  Its now beginning to really piss me off.
