I've spent the rollercoaster that is my career struggling to make a better existence for myself. For the last 10 years I have worked in the blue collar side of property management.  I started out as a groundskeeper for an aging apartment community on the north side of town.  ghetto!  Excuse me. Groundskeeper is the polite way of saying Trash-picker-upper-er. As I learned more of how to fix things and aquired some of my own tools, I was quickly promoted to Maintenance Technician. This worked out nicely for me as I was 19 and making $7.hr. good money for the time, especially for a kid just out of high school. After about 2 years of good service, a co-worker and I both decided that we wanted to make a move up. We both applied at a luxury apartment community on the east side(much closer to home for me) and we both got hired immediately.  That was great while it lasted. The place was much newer and the clientelle much richer. One experienceI remember vividly is tracing, cutting out, painting, and assembling 4 wooden reindeer and a miniature sleigh. There was so little work to do that we spent a great deal of time shooting the breeze with the boss in our garage/shop. I guess that's why only 4 months in the new company transferred me to a property in greater need of competent staff.  My third place, much like the first, ghetto! I'm sorry, there must be a draft in here... No shortage of work there. This stage in my career is whereI learned the most, I became a real MacGyver so to speak. You've got a problem? I'll solve it. Check out the beat while the d.j. resolves it. was my attitude. Well, soon enough the opportunity presented itself for me to get the h*ck outta dodgeto a nicer, newer propertymanaged bythe same company.  Sweetness!!! An upscale neighborhood easy to work on and when I got married in '98, we got a huge discount onanapartment there. Things were looking great and occasionally they would send me to help out at some less than desirable communities, but I retained my spot at that place for nearly 3 years.  Then, at the dawn of the new millenium, my dream job! January 3rd, 2000 I took a position based out of the corporate office, along with which came a company van, gas card, cell phone, responsibility, and best of all freedom. I was partially responsible for around 1000 units located everywhere in the city and surronding suburbs. Not just aparments but split-doubles/twin-singles, condos, and huge single family homes.PlusI got to drive around for the majority of the day, here and there, to and fro, and get paid wellfor it. Loving my job for the first time in my life... until...you can hear the scary music (dunh dunh duuuuuuuunh!). The district manager called me a few days before Thanksgiving for a "meeting" during which she informed me that "Effective Monday, you'll start at 'such and such property', they really need your help over there". My chin needed figurative stitches, my jaw hit the floor so hard. "What Bull-Poopie!", I thought. "I'm just now familiar with the routes, the parts, and thepaperwork. Who in their right mind would uproot me now?"Monday came and I relinquished my keys phone and gas card, and made my way to my new home property. Located just minutes from the airport  ghetto! and aptly nick-named "Oozy-Alley", thisnext stop onthe line gave me a chance to exercise my supervisorial skills.Staffed with 2 employees, 1. a guy 3 times myage who had never done maintenance before, andb. a 19 year oldguy from south of the border. I'mnot sure to this day how muchhe understood of what I said. Like, "Work starts at8 a.m." and "You can't sleep in the common entrances." and "Stop going home in the middle of the day." He's the only guy I ever enjoyed firing.You may wonder, if you've read this far, who my replacement was inmy prior cushy position. It seems they had no trouble finding someone on short notice. The district manager's husband was looking for work at just the right time. My understandingof company policy on relatives workingdirectly in the chain of command must have been wrong.After 4 1/2 years with the same company, that slap in the face was the last straw so I began to actively seek new employment.  A job fair was my foot in the door with my current employer. I took a mainenancetest, missing the 1 question on which I changed my answer from the correct oneto a second guess. Then immediately had an interview with the V.P. She offered me a job on the spot.  Back to the top of the pile.  I started a 3 and a half year tenure at an upscale community where I chose to fly under the radar and stay out of the eye of thebig-wigs so as to secure my place as a cornerstone at this one property and not get shuffled around. Successful at doing so, I saw many others come and go, but I remained. Until recently...  As a result of restructuring within our division, beginning in March we've implemented zone maintenance coverage, which means less individual attention on the property level and more of a focus on the district level. By doing this they effectively eliminated allproperty level supervisors. Subsequently they appointed a "lead tech" on each site. I became one of them. Thus added responsibility, and stress with no additional compensation. As the newfound pressures wore on us it showed. With trouble elsewhere in the zone andour already understaffed status, the poop hit the fan when one of our own was injured by a circular saw. Change became inevitable, but why did it have to include me? One of a handful of solid dependable techs in the district, comfortable right there in my own little corner of the world, I was ripped from my warm environment and thrown out in the cold all alone. Though I fought it tooth and nail, with every valid reason why I should stay, they chose not to hear or care.  So here I am now at a property just over a year old, only 254 apartments, a 15,000 gallon pool, and a mini-gym. Sounds great right? Here's the catch. This brand new property was built as a neighborhood improvement project.A pet project of the Mayor of our fair city. The problem, as I see it is that his logic is flawed. -- Let's build a brand new apartment complex in a well established ghetto! part of town and hope it spreads it's newness and goodness like a virus to the surrounding community. NOT! But it does have quite an appeal for the nearby residents. They're really trying to get in. As a matter of fact they're breaking in! In my first 2 weeks, I replaced 3 front doors. Did I mention that this place is a stones throw from where I started in the industry?  Enough for now. More updates will surely follow.
