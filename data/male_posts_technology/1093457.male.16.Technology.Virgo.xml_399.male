And to celebrate, Tom and I have had simulatneous book burnings! I burnt my book which wasn't entierly successful, firstly it wouldn't light, and when it finally caught light some dead leaves caught alight too, and set fire to the fence!! OOPS! when I'd finished, I cam back up and found a folder full of notes and songs from choir, which of course I had to burn too! This was a little more successful, I went down behind the wall at the bottom and created a nice little bonfire, whihc burnt very well for about half an hour until it started to rain. But all my music is now reduced to ashes, which actually feels like a great relief. Ok, so it's vandalism. Ok it ruins the atmosphere. And ok, a few flowers got singed. But hey,. it'ss a weight off myh mind!
