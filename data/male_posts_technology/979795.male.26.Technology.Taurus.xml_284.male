Tried the Swedish meatballs that Annie had recommended ever so highly :P. It was pretty good. A bit on the pricy side though, $5.50.  Caught 'Intolerable Cruelty' today too, starring George Clooney and Catherine Zeta Jones. Was ok. Was about a lawyer and a lady who married and divorced pple for their assets. They started out on opposite sides, then slowly fell in love and got together. They tried to trick each other all using the idea of a pre-nuptial agreement. I think the pre-nup is a safe way for these kinda 'weird' marriages. But to require things to reach an extent like this, I think there's a real lack of trust. If that's necessary, maybe it's not right to get married afterall. It felt nice to see them tearing up the pre-nup in the end tho. At least it meant something, but there was also an earlier similar scene which was faked to lull the guy into a force sense of security.  Just caught a documentary on SAF peacekeeping forces in Timor Leste. It was inspiring, to say the least. This used to be restricted for regulars only, but I'm glad they opened it up to NSFs and NSmen as well. I would've loved to do this during my NSF period for a few mths. It would've added more meaning into my NSF life.
