For instance, you might be blogging about your latest trip to Hawai'i and have dozens or hundreds of photos to share with your friends. If you create a photo album and upload your pictures there, your readers will be able to click a link and browse all your photos in easy thumbnail or slideshow formats. They could even order prints for themselves, and you wouldn't even have to worry about keeping track of how many reprints to get of which picture. It's very convenient all around.   There are a number of sites that offer free photo album services services. You can do a  urlLink Google  search to find them, or you can start by checking out some of these links:     urlLink DotPhoto     urlLink Fotki      urlLink Ofoto     urlLink Shutterfly     urlLink SmugMug       Another fun thing to do with your photos is to create a photoblog. This is like a blog, but rather than a series of text entries, it's a series of photos. You can upload them from your computer, or even email them in, which means that if you have a camera phone, you don't even have to be near a computer to send in photos. A free-roaming, mobile blog like this is often called a "moblog." A good place to go to create a free photoblog is  urlLink Buzznet . They even have a way you can syndicate your images and display the latest ones as thumbnails on your website.   Windows users can also post photos directly to their blogs with the  urlLink Hello BloggerBot .
