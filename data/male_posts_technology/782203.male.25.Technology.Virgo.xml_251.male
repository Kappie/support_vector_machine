Sigh times like this I really wished I had a chick to fool around with. Instead ended up just watching a cartoon (Who Framed Roger Rabbit),  doing some of my work tasks and surfing porn. Oh but did catch Payback at night; it was a pretty cool movie starring Mel Gibson, had a whole noir-ish feel to it. Don't ask me what noir-ish is , I got the word off a review off the movie I read online.  I think I probably spent the whole morning up to lunch just replying all the emails that I got. I exchanged multiple emails with my colleague about this project we were working on ; eventhough he was only 2 tables away.  I thought emails were supposed to make your life easier instead of being a hassle.
