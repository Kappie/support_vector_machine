Basically, I read the whole week long, got through almost all the way through "Lord of the Rings". But I think it's weird that I read a lot and don't have a HUGE sex drive. Although, I am 23 and I guess I have passed my sexual peak, biologically speaking. Don't get me wrong, I want to have sex. I want someone to return the ball.  Love: physical or mental? This is the problem, usually people who are physically attractive aren't the brightest. Although, one of the things I love about being a guy, is we usually get better with age. Not that I don't think girls get worse, it's just that women usually find older men attractive. It's weird, I think I'd always want to be mentally attracted to a person. Although, the physical attraction, usually overpowers any mental attraction (at least as far as I can tell).   Isn't it weird how we all find the same people attractive? It's the whole, diamond in the rough thing. Finding the one that others have been looking over, cause they don't find them so attractive as say, ricky Martin or Elizabeth Shue. Finding the diamond, that's what it's about
