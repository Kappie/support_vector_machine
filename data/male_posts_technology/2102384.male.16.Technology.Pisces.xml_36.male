One of them is still a broken link and I haven't made any thumbnails for the pictures yet.  I hope to make a nice little page for these wallpapers that shows a thumbnail, picture name, resolution, and picture taker.  Right now the page is hosted on my 1GB Oktagone server but I hope to move it to my friend's 1GB Powweb server once he gives me all of his pictures from the trip also.   urlLink   Wallpapers Page
