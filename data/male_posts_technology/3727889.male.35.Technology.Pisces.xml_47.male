I took $10 and made it $80 at one point, then sunk it to $70 before I left. Not bad for a night of 1/2. I just could not lose. It was one of those nights where you play 7-2 as a joke, and win! Every single time! I am very happy with my 1/2$ strategy. I take $10 and play it as long as I can. If I go out, I might buy in again for another 10 at a different table. If I get to 40 bucks, I cap my loses back off at $30. I then increase the bottom level for every extra 10$ I win. It has been a good strategy so far. Anyway, I am in a $10 Tourney now. Figure I would blow some of my winnings. If I have a good night tomorrow, I am going to try some 2/4 or 3/6 for a few hands (same strategy, but with $20 or $30 instead of $10). I will keep you posted on the results.
