She wasn't going fast enough to be getting into the fast lane, but as usual she was oblivious to her driving.  "Cheee Teaaaa Kwaannn DOOOO!" she sang on. Still the kids mouths hung wide. All of the sudden she realized just in the nick of time that the car she was coming up on wasn't going fast. "Wa da fuck is dis foo doin?" she said with a thick accent still left over from her time in china. She was trying to figure out what to do quick. So she swerved to her right.  Crash! "Oh shi!" she screamed as she realized she had hit another car. The car started spinning out of control. Then it started to flip end over end. Like something you would see out of an elaborate car chase filmed by a Hollywood director. All she could do was put her hands on the roof and scream "WEEEEE!".  After the car had stopped flipping and came to a rest on the roof of the van. She looked back at the kids and asked them if they had as much fun as she had. They just stared back with blank expressionless faces. "Oh, wow, I wan do again." she said as she started to crawl out of the car.  As the police arrived on the scene. They saw only a little Chinese lady grasping what looked to be two child size dolls. As the police approached the Chinese lady they asked, "Are you OK?". The Chinese Lady said "Oh, I fine, want do again, but children do not." The police stared at each other for a moment then realized she was talking about the mannequins.  She currently resides in your local Mental Institution...
