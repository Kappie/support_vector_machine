One has to wade through jillions of Spanish language and home shopping channels just to get to the International channel.  Which only has Chinese programming on occasion.    The nice lady at the Comcast office offered to set us up with  urlLink CCTV 4  for only $14.95 extra.  If  I weren't already sending them a C-note every month, I wouldn't have laughed so hard.  Maybe I should ask for a $1 credit for each channel we don't watch?
