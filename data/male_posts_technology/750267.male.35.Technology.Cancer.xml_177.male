Namely, I have a flat-panel LCD monitor at home, I purchased a digital camera, I have a wireless network, and I took a carribean vacation this year. So you see, the top three items have been taken care of.   Here's my new list. I have some money burning a hole in my pocket, so I should be able to take care of some of these soon.  1)   urlLink Tablet PC   - I couldn't convince myself in 2003 that I needed a third computer (besides my home desktop and existing laptop). I met someone the other day that had four computers at home. I don't know why... Perhaps Santa will bring me a new laptop this Christmas. I have my eye on the tablet PC's, which have a really cool form factor.  2)  DVDs  - I'll pick up Matrix Reloaded, LOTR: The Two Towers Special Extended Edition, and Terminator 3... Only problem is figuring out when I'll have time to watch them all.  3)  USB Flash Drive  - 128 MB on a keychain. Cool.  4)   urlLink TiVo   - I so want to try one of these digital recorders. I mean, the ability to record without having to fumble with VCR cassettes, or accidentally tape over something important... Pause live programs, instant replays... Why don't these things come to Canada already?  5)  Dual-Monitor Display  - I've read rave reviews from people who use two monitors to work, and it sounds like it would be an increase in productivity. Screen real estate is always going to be a problem with only one monitor (unless you use a 21 inch+ screen I suppose...).  I still want to get a new cell phone, and I'm buying a new car next week. (That doesn't count, does it?) But, for now, that's what my wish list looks like.
