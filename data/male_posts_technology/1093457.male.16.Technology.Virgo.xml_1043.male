When we went up to London on Monday on a coach we drove the whole length of where Croydon is - it really does go quite a long way until it becomes London; but anyway, I saw about 10 of them and half of them were talking to people and doing things. Fortunately I haven't had to talk to a police man for quite a little while, but I hate this racist issue. The press seem to think that every single person in the Met is racist and say they should get more black officers. In case you haven't noticed, you can't advertise specifically for that kind of thing as that is racist. The whole thing has to much PC behind it and I hate it all. I am quite intilted to say what I am about to say as it is a view, a belief, an experience and is true, but there are more black people causing on-the-street crime than white. This is true, and I know myself, all three of the blokes who mugged me where black; and their ain't that many black people wondering around Sanderstead village at 4pm on a Tuesday afternoon in January. So, my point is, the whole thing about stop-and-search being done to more black people than white seems fair to me entirely. I know a police man, in fact I know three, but this one in particular was talking to me about this issue when he worked for Croydon police, and white people do more robbery from houses and other non-violent crime, where as black people do more violent crime. The problem is, there is more violent crime around at the moment. Point made.  Another thing that is really annoying me at the moment is the 'new look' BBC News 24. It's rubbish. The idea of this channel was to become different from all the other 24 hour news channels, to be unique - which it was. Now it looks even more like Sky News which I despise, they are all following the horrible American TV which is truly terrible. BBC Three is dropping the only show I watch on that channel, Liquid News, and instead they had Johnny Vaughn with that chat show he did, which again is identical to these American ones where the audience clap whenever the presenter says a word that has 3 or more syllables in it. So I'm not impressed with the BBC at the moment - although I have been listening to Radio 4 quite a lot recently, I'm turning into an old man.  Oh yeah, one more thing (maybe). Today, while in HMV, browsing my way through the CDs, two blokes next to me, having a chat. Normal everyday things people do; but what are they doing while talking to each other? Holding their penis. Really, you know it's there, you probably saw it this morning when you were getting changed, do you really need to hold it all the time? I know it sticks out a bit, but you can buy special underwear that holds it in if you have those kind of problems. If you're afraid it's going to fall off, don't worry, this is the 21st century, we can glue it back on. But seriously, stop holding your cock, it just isn't right, especially when you're talking to another bloke, and in public.  I watched the Railway Children today, and it made me realise how much PC we have in this world today. It is so stupid it's not true. Signs everywhere telling us what to do and what not to do. Don't stick your head out the window. Don't jump off the cliff. This packet of nuts contains nuts. In the movie, the children are allowed to go out, run around the place, be happy, explore. Now, they would have to be with an adult and wouldn't be able to go and talk to the station master. Alright, East Croydon isn't exactly the best place, but smaller ones like Sanderstead and this wonderful little station in North Wales I went to. The village has about 10 houses in it, and the station is so small you have to ask the train driver to stop at the station when you get on the train; and wave your hand when you see the train coming to stop it.  I'm worried about Jo. She said something about her PC not working, so I can understand her not being on MSN or blogging; but I've text her earlier today and no reply. Hope all is well, anybody heard from her?  Blimey that's a long blog. Need to have a nap now.
