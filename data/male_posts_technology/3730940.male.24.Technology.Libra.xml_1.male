I tried to impress everyone with my limited knowledge of French, but it quicky became apparent the only French Iknowis"J'abite la fromage", which I believe means "I live in cheese".  Played guitar for most of yesterday, writing two songs that at the time seemed to be the greatest songs ever written, but in hindsight were as bad as my usual efforts. Went into work today for a couple of hours today, damn my enthusiasm.
