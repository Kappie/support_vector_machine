This time it's not in  urlLink Burundi  but in Peru  Newcastle.   urlLink Bellavista Juventud  was set up in Iquitos and is run by a pit yakker priest called Father Joe Plumb. Finances are tight so the Bellavista Social Club has been set up to help provide funds for strips  equipment. This club is based in Newcastle and can count the best Peruvian footballer (evar) amongst it's members. They had their inaugural night out in the  urlLink Egypt Cottage  which is just around the corner from here. We could have went to that for our second night out!   BykerSink, over at  urlLink Space Hardware , has something to do with the blog so expect Billy Brag lyrics with added pan pipes. Or Something.
