In other words, should I post a string of editorial style discourse, or should I be a little braver and write about things that are important to me without trying overly hard to be witty or to entertain you-- who are you anyway?  I think the reason I started this blog was "for awesome"-- it sure is tempting to bail on that idea. I used to journal faithfully, but sort of gave it up when I got married. Having my own personal person seemed like it made journaling pointless, but now I'm interested in starting that process up again. I also want my friends to know me better, if they dare to follow my ramblings. So, I'll try to bare my soul for commentary; you are also welcome to comment, Internet, if you really are out there.  Sadly, this feeling of loneliness is already passing. It hurts, but I also cherish it. As my wife could tell you, I really want friends about once every two months, and the rest of the time I don't much seem to care if people like me or not. Objectively speaking, I find this very depressing, since it leads to a yucky end result where I have no community and live outside of the abundance that God offers. I only seem to realize this acutely on nights like tonight, but I know that it's true the rest of the time too. The other bad part is that I don't have a clue how to get from point A (sporadic loneliness) to point B (building solid friendships). Actually, I must give my wife props here, she throws some clues my way, but they usually seem too awkward for me. Whenever I do try to make an attempt it invariably fizzles out, and everyone seems happy to let it. I guess I'm just very easily discouraged. I wish I knew Joe from the movie  urlLink The Station Agent , someone intent on being my best friend no matter what. More likely, God is trying to teach me how to be a friend. Friendship is after all a quintessential characteristic of the Trinity, and we are invited into that communion with God.
