Finally, 7/6/2004 I found a diet that works for me.  I am hitting it fast and furious because it’s rare for me to be able to go through a day not starving constantly…  For me this diet has been a miracle and I hope it stays that way.  I haven’t taken any pills or supplements other than vitamins to stay healthy.  This diet focuses on eating low fat, high protein, and medium carbohydrate.  This diet counts every calorie and watches the values of fat, carbohydrates, and proteins.  The diet requires high motivation and the willingness to eat to live, not live to eat.    This is all new to me at the moment, I feel as if I have come across a miracle that works for me.  It’s too new to know if it will continue to work for me, but by October 6th I will know exactly how well it is working.  October 6th will be the next day I step on the scales.  It is a three month diet trial and I don’t want to risk screwing it up by stepping on the scales and lowering motivation.  My current weight is 252, with this new diet I worry heavily about losing muscle mass quickly.  The diet only has between 1,300-1,700 calories depending on the day.  I am not hungry at all during this time, but I am exercising profusely because I have the energy to do so.  On this diet I have high energy, high self control, and I don’t feel hungry…   I am paying close attention to my body.  If I feel weak I add more carbohydrates, if I feel hungry I add more proteins, and if my body hurts I will change exercises.  If I can remember, my next report on Weight will be October the 6th hopefully with a loss of 15-20 pounds of fat not muscle.  My long term weight goal is about 180-200lb of muscle not fat.  Once I lose the fat, I fully intend to continue dieting and exercising for life to maintain what I want to achieve.
