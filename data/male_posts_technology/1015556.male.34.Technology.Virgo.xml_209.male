Travelling with our youth admin/catalyst, a young adults pastor, and a youth small groups coord.  Great group of people.   Also found this  urlLink link  from someone who went last year.  Nice set of notes. In preparation, one of them gave me a CD to listen to from Erwin.  Intense, my notes are below. =====   I sam 14  biblical change agents  redepmtive XXXX the longer we live the more we want to hold on to what we have to live impetuously not to protect what he had but to expand an expansionist - driven by urgency jonathan was an expansionist paul was a protectionist  the resources of God the authority of God the urgency and passion of God put those three in the same people  a biblical context for what we must become for God's future 8 characteristics of a biblical change agent for God  1 - take initiative amazed at how many christians are passive about God's will  we are egocentric about God's will for our lives the center point is MY life  the people that i know that initiate -  they look at humanity, they see the brokenness, their hearts are transformed by the longing of humanity they stop saying 'God what is your will for MY life' they say 'God I want to make a difference in someone elses life' they stop worrying about what their life is supposed to be about they worry about what God wants done in human history they ask, 'God what is on your heart?' they ask, 'What is breaking your heart Lord, what do you want done?'  Amazing how God can shape a life when they move based on what they feel is on God's heart  2 - understands and uses influence use the influence properly Jonathan does not wake up his father does not wake up his army understands appropriateness  some people feel like they are powerless to make change trying to bring change up instead of sideways and down God doesn't hold you responsible for influence he doesn't give you  there are people in your life that are living passive apathetic lives because you are  how come this new person is taking on some much responsibility? 'the kingdom of God is not a labor union' when a person comes to Christ and recieves the urgency of Christ, their influence expands  a holy life is not a passive life i don't do drugs anymore  i don't beat my husband anymore salvation and transformation is not just about what you do not do anymore Christ was ressurceted not to stop you from doing something but to get you to do something  people with intense characters are the leaders the way you expand your influence in the kingdom is that you deepen your character in Christ  3 - operate in the realm of uncertainty jonathan wakes the armor barer up when Jonathan says, "Perhaps the LORD will act in our behalf"  you never absolutely know become a risk taker for God  willing to live in the realm of uncertainty  some things we know certainly: Jonathan understands who God is - that is certain, concrete do you wait to act until you have concrete evidence? paradigms sound like the concept of faith two levels of faith: a - God speaks to us and its outside of our experience God calls us to a level of living outside of our experience God inviting us to where we have not been before the realm of possibility  b - in the realm of the impossible beyond the explainable Sarah's faith and Mary's faith the church normally identifies faith as anything outside the realm of our possibilities God is calling us to live in the realm of the impossible when we begin to live in the impossible, when God does not do it, we fail  4 - they embrace inherent dangers v. 8 cross over towards the men, but let them see us we are afriad to declare anything that is from the Lord we are afraid to risk anything that might fail won't we ruin God's name? when you work with the poor, every single day is a test of viability the Bible has no promise in it that you and i will survive this war, but we will be part of the victory celebration are we willing to inherit the dangers of glorfying God in the impossible?  5 - strategize from an advance mentality the high place is the strategic place high ground God is calling us forward, never backwards, never stationary it's not hard to avoid God - think small, dream small, live small as soon as you start thinking big - God becomes involved Jer 33:3 the impossiblity zone is the God zone it's over when you decide you have to give your life to something bigger than yourself  knowing that God always calls you to more ideas are a dime a dozen biblical risk taker doesn't just cast vision a person who allows Jesus to incarnate his life  6 - they draw others into the movement they don't live alone they don't see the battle as theirs - they see it as the Lords the 2nd most outstanding soldier was his armor bearer other people take note, but they don't understand   7 - is a person who God uses to bring communal help there is a lot of brokenness and dysfunction kingdom risk takers make people healthy they move people to health a critical missing ingredient in humanity - we were created for mission and purpose created by God to live with intention the less intention we have, the more broken we become  God heals them when they get into the battle if we as God's people will move together with courageous faith, that we will see multitudes come to Christ and find healing in the battle
