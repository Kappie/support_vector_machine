Now, I had heard about this supposed  urlLink DMCRA  which is meant to "fix" some  urlLink things that were wrong  with the  urlLink DMCA , so this doesn't come as total news, but I'm glad to see people are starting to take notice of this.   Ok, I realize I have given you a lot of links to read over, but this is kind of important to me. I am glad that this issue is finally being addressed. Too many companies have brandished the DMCA at anyone they deem "evil" (which in most cases, translates to people like me, and probably you, that like to figure things out or possibly write our own software to emulate another program). In my opinion, and in the opinions of others, the DMCA was a knee-jerk reaction to events and concepts that were not understood by the people that made the law. The DMCA greatly cripples the ability to legitimately explore software and hardware. It gives companies the power to file legal action against individual researchers giving reports of vulnerabilities. It also gives companies the ability to extradite foreigners who reverse engineer their products or security features, even if it was done for personal "fair-use".  From what the article says however, it doesn't look like this proposal will get too far. Butch Otter (R-Idaho) looked down on it saying, "Theft is theft and property is property".  Hey Butch, no shit, I'm glad you explained that in such a way that my simple mind could comprehend it. The problem is, Butch, the DMCA doesn't just stop thieves from thieving property, it stops legitimate researchers from doing anything more than sticking their collective thumbs up their collective asses. Without research, Butch, we cannot innovate, and without innovation we cannot progress as a society.  I think that about covers my thoughts at the moment, I might comment further in a little while.    -intX    hug the duck
