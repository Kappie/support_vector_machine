       Graham Sticks 

    

    

       Belching, bloating, throat burning 

    

     

 

 

 The bloating and belching really seems to have lessened now (12:40 am).  I brushed my teeth and perhaps coincidently that seems to have helped with the burning in my throat.  At least the taste of  urlLink Crest 's new  urlLink Herbal Mint  toothpaste is a hell of a lot better than what I was dealing with.  That was good marketing too, they sent me a sample in the mail and I liked it, so I bought a tube. 

 My intestines are continuing to slowly cramp up, but its very mild. 

  Update:  I've just  have  to push my luck.  It's 2:00 am, everything was settled down, and I decide to eat some  urlLink Honey Maid graham sticks .  They're new, like graham crackers that have already been broken into the little sticks.  They're ok, but not quite exactly the same consistency of regular graham crackers.  The crackers make me thirsty so I drink some water and the whole belching and bloating thing starts all over again.  Of course, the belching brings more acid up into my throat, which has begun to burn again.  South Beach Diet my ass, get yourself what I've got and you'll be thin in no time.
