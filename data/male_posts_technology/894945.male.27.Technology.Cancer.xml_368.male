(ONLY JOKING)  Ok lets sum up the period which I have been quiet. Um..what have I been doing??? Right well Toaster is back so I am now just Baity again..well maybe 2nd in command Baity, yeah that's cool!  It's good to have Adam back though, we did miss him, and now he is back we can all go out and behave badly again. It seems to have been ages since I have gone out and done anything, probably due to the fact that I have banished myself to my house in an effort to save money! Anyway, we did all go out last week. We all went to Chicago Rock Cafe with some of our mates that came across the waters from Guernsey (Nick and Mark yo). The night kicked off with a grand Chinese meal, then once we got to CRC we just partied the night away! Yes the Vodka got flowing, well it did for me anyway, and well...maybe a bit of tequila too. Now as usual Toaster started eyeing up the girls present, ok we all did, and he smoothly made his way into the throng to attempt pull, followed closely by Custard (now theres a surprise!!!), I really don't know how they do it! Maybe I should stop being the shy twat and get in there!!! The rest of the night was great.  Ok so I am attempting to grow my hair longer now, after having a shaved head for the last 6 years! I am kinda in that phase where I usually say "Fuck it!" and get it shaved again doh! However, I am actually ok with it at the moment, although a few people are protesting that I should shave it again. Thing is I just wouldn't mind being able to go to the SPLASH and headbang properly for a change! Plus I feel like I just want a change for once, does that make sense???  Now I heard that the SPLASH re-opened last week and it was ok, although they are still playing the same old stuff (which is getting a bit dull). That's right, I didn't attend the re-opening, the reason why? Simple, I couldn't be arsed! Yep that's right, I couldn't be arsed to go to the SPLASH. (what's wrong with me? I dunno).  Finally to wrap things up, I am heading over to Guernsey this weekend to go see all my mates over there. To be honest I would like to go to Guernsey for more than just a weekend sometime this year, it's kinda growing on me. Just when I go over there I have met some really cool people like all the LARP guys, and all the guys at GAIA'S WEB, cheers to Lyndz for replying to my E-mails, (if your ever in Guernsey then go check it out!).   I will hopefully start a new photo album soon, need some new material!  Although I have plans hehehehe! Ok I am probably ranting now so catch you all soon,  Baity signing off.........
