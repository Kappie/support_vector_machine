I am sure that I will make it through, but I have a test on Wednesday and I am still stuck on the 2nd section.  It looks like it will be nothing but Math for the next few days.  Sorry Chinese class, but I have no choice.  Anyways I just had to take a break from studying because my mind was turning into a well blended milkshake.  Now back to the fun!  This better be worth it :)
