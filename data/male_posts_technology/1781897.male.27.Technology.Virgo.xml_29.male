In California, prison guards get raises, road construction stops, and books get ripped out of the hands of children all in the name of a shortage of money.  How does this progressive, forerunning state respond?  Hey, lets spend hundres of millions of dollars on a fucken recall election so that we can clearly decide once and for all which is better....herpies or the clap?????  I'm soo fucken pissed about this....I couldn't imagine if I had kids going to school here, cause then I might go fucken postal!  As I drive back to work from the gym, my favorite radio staion (810 KGO AM) informs me that people all around the state are bitching because the election that should have been blocked by the surpreme court, is not going very smooth.  There missing ballots, broken machines, lack of privacy, and a slew of other issues preventing these idiots from reiterating their choice for head douche bag!  California people....I laugh at you!  I will not participate in your frivilous spending of precious resources by voting in your unnecessary election!  Fucken hippies!  Arnold for office!
