According to  urlLink Mid-day , Sayyed Khwaja Yunus Sayyed Khwaja Ayub, one of the accused in the Ghatkopar bomb blast case escaped from police custody. It seems that the police car, ferrying Ayub to Aurangabad for interrogation, overturned on the way. In true filmi style, Ayub, grabbing this chance, ran away handcuffed!  Art imitates life imitates art!! ...  go figure!  ;-)
