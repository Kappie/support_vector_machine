Could they be of Laci Peterson and her unborn child? There's a good chance.  On a  completely separate and unrelated note, why would you dump your wife's body in a lake, and then tell police you were fishing at the same lake at the time of the murder? When they find the body later, you've basically implicated yourself.  Scott
