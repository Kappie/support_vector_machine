But common sense analysis says, 'don't do anything that will cause the other side to do MORE of what you're opposed to (in this case, harvesting trees), ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE NOT WINNING, and YOU'RE THE EXTREME MINORITY!'   The ELF has targeted lumberyards in the past, claiming they contribute to ecological destruction and sprawl.  Lumberyards cause sprawl like spoons cause obesity.   In other  urlLink tree-hugging news , crews got to start 7 hours late after GreenPeas wasted resources on a shipping container.  After authorities removed three protesters locked inside and outside the shipping container to prevent its movement, loggers  hooked a chain to the back of a pickup truck  and dragged the 20-foot container to the side of the road, getting to work seven hours late on the Soukow timber sale about five miles west of Glendale (emphasis mine.)    HAH! They moved it with a pickup truck! Y'know for about the same price, you could've dumped a bunch or rock in the middle of the road; at least they would've had to use equipment (other than what the men drove to work in) to take care of it. You might've put them behind a whole day!   I wonder how many beached whales one could stuff into said container? Or how many pounds of Little Lisa's Fish Slurry one would hold?
