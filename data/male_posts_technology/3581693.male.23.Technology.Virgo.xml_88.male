First of all - it wasn't FREE... they would only cover $3.29 of the total cost - and guess what - that's not how much they retail for... cheap bastards...   Anyways - so it cost me $1.05 - which compaired to FREE - well it isn't FREE!   So I'm very excited to use it... I have this mark on my wall from when they hung the curtain rod... and I thought perfect test... it's a little black mark - no scratches or anything... so I start erasin'... hmmmm it's not going away... but wait - what's that... oh - that's the paint... disapearing... WONDERFUL.   Ok - maybe it's my fault... maybe I put too much elbow grease into it... those of you who have ever seen meor even just my elbow for that matter - would know that I have a lot of elbow grease... so maybe I don't know how to properly use the "magic" eraser... yeah right!   It's a POS - end of story!
