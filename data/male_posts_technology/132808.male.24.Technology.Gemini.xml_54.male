I'm somewhere around 95 with my tax return and one paycheck to go).  And as guilty a pleasure Rocky IV is, I still can't get over the totally retarded ending.  Only Sylvester Stallone can make an ending so ridiculous that you forget about how savagely fake the beatings Rocky receives before he 'hulks up' and eventually wins are.  In the heart of the USSR, against their national hero (and if you didn't know he was their national hero, the giant 50 foot banner with his picture beside the pick and sickle should serve as an obvious visual reminder), the crowd starts to chant "Rocky"?!?  Because of his determination and heart?  Get the fuck out of here.  That's like, in a sold out Air Canada Centre, the crowd starts chanting, "USA! USA!" because we've outshot them 53-16 in the second period yet it's still 1-1.  It ain't happening.  That's the only thing that pisses me off about this movie.  That, and no Clubber Lang.  Clubber Lang vs Ivan Drago would be a crazy sweet fight.  Cause we all know Rocky would have had his ass stomped by these two in real life.  I'm in this weird state where I really wanna catch some old episodes of MacGyver.  I wanna see how truly fake that shit was.  I wonder if it's on DVD, or if they play it on Prime or Spike or something.  Miami Vice back to back with MacGyver would be sweet.  Like the Seinfeld/Friends or Full House/Family Matters combos.  Two great shows, one after the other.  Booyah!  Hey Wes, hook it up with the DVD (or  is it VHS) inventory program!
