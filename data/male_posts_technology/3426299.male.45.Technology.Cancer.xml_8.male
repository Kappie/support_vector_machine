My family was disapointed with the US embassy by denying tourist visa for my parents. This was the 2nd time my question is why? My parents were already old, ages 74 and 64 and if they suspect thatthey will not comeback to the Philippines they are wrong since only my sister is in the US they just want to visit. Maybe they think my parents are terorist :) over...SHIT USA....
