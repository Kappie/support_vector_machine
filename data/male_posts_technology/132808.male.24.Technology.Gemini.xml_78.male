It took me on a fantasy ride into the past.  It was a tad really depressing.  Fuck, was life sweet in 98.  There was the Mustang, there was Nex and his Swift, there was Tec, it even reminds me of Jennifer Daeninck.  I haven't said that name in a while.  It's weird, because every song reminds me of something.  Like "Ghetto Superstar", which reminded me of those homos at Sisler who played that song NON FUCKING STOP during the track meet.  From 9 am until 4 pm, it was Pras and Mya: Repeat One.  Or "Come With Me" by P. Diddy (nee Puff Daddy) and Jimmy Page, which reminded me of the Drive-in when we saw Godzilla, and it marked the first time ever me and Wes were determined to NOT fall asleep during Godzilla, just so we knew the entire movie sucked.  No one could be like, "Oh, you fell asleep during the best part!!" like everyone was with eXistenZ and the bone gun.  But you know what the shittiest thing was?  Do you know what the number one song of 1998 was?  In a year that had "My Heart will go On", "I don't wanna miss a thing", and a host of songs from various boy bands like 5ive, Hanson and Mase, the number one song is fucking "Too Close" by Next.  That's so weak.  When someone asks me "What was the number one song the year you graduated?"  I have to say, "Ummm, it was 'Too Close' by Next".  Wow.
