Yesterday after work I went to Forrest Grove and met Peter and Pat, then we went up to Brady's and I got to see my baby (my firstborn you could say... that sounds too weird to say though). After a while we went to Washington Square and met Armaan and goofed around at the Apple Store. It was fun and I'm sure the salespeople hated me especially (I love it, really I do).  After that we went to Subway but it was closed, so we went to McDonalds and ate random food (2 cheeseburgers! Wow!). On the way out I spotted my old friends from Frosh and Soph years, Brodi and Sam (they graduated my Soph year). They didn't see me but we ended up walking a ways behind them, and then there were tons of people from back then. So I got to see Brodi, Sam, Jenny, Maggie, and Amanda again... and I'm sure more people that I totally didn't notice... yeah that was really cool. They were all commenting on how much older i am, it was weird...  Pat was feeling sick so we went to Armaan's and hung out there watching videos from the other night, until parents came to get us (though Pat spent the night).  When I got home I walked into my room to find that my computer case had arrived a day early... so i stayed up a little too late fiddeling with it and a laptop I grabbed from Armaan.  That's really about it.  Goodness I hope I can get to Vancouver sometime this week...
