One of my fortune-cookie maxims is that "Communication only occurs when the message received is the same message that was sent, and the sender knows the message was received." I was discussing this with the therapist yesterday. I think I have tried to Anne my thought or fears or problems, and I think she hears me, but I don't get the feedback I need to let me know she understands, or she doesn't and I need to say more. On the other side, I think that because of my depression I have not been very receptive to listening or receiving her messages. I think that she could make more of an effort to let me know what is in her mind, because trying to read her mind has not been very successful.     The shrink says that she has rules for when it is time to 'talk turkey' (her words). Among the rules are that you only speak truth, which may be uncomfortable for one or both people, but do not make judgments about or blame the other person. I think this is major stumbling block for me. One of my favorite coping mechanisms through life has been to avoid confrontation, and avoid rocking the boat. I think I would rather not say potentially uncomfortable things which may cause damage to our relationship, and instead keep it all in to avoid causing a problem. I suppose it may be a minor discomfort now, but wait a few years and see how these non-spoken issues grow very large and very painful to deal with. I am also afraid of the worst-case scenario, where we finally decide to say nothing but the truth, and it turns out that the truth hurts so much we can not recover. That would be worse for me than holding it all in and self-destructing.     Having said this, I think we will be OK in the end, but it will be painful getting there.
