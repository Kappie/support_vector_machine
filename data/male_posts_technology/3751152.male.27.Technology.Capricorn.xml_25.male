NL stands for No-Limit.  The game in question is Texas Holdem...The Cadillac of Poker  I've been kinda a student to the game of No-Limit Texas Holdem for about 4 years now.  When I was at the Casino a few weeks ago on training (Not poker training, work training, I just stayed at the casino hotel :)), I picked up a few magazines that are delivered to all canadian casinos.  Its called Canadian Poker Player ( urlLink Http://www.canadianpokerplayer.com ).  In the May issue, they had an article regarding home games.  I was very shocked to see that there was an article about a home game right here in Fredericton.  So I sent them an email to get an invite to their weekly home games and monthly tournaments.  Tonight will mark my first NL tournament with this group, and I'm very much looking forward to it.  I've been playing with the same group of guys from home for years now, and I pretty much know their betting patterns and strategies.  When you sit down at a table with a completely new crowd, you always learn something new.  I'm very much looking forward to tonight, not only for the game I love, but to meet new people in the city.    Now, off that subject, and maybe a quick response to Fire's post regarding fears....  I never thought I did before, but I really fear death.  I sometimes get this chill in my body whenever I think of what would happen if I died tomorrow, what the (2, maybe 3 ;)) people would do if I was gone.  When I was young, I was kinda a daredevil...I never feared getting hurt, and would do just about anything people dared me to do.  Now that I'm settling down with my life, I fear dying more and more every day.  I wonder why I do.  I guess its the natural life cycle.    I never really noticed this until I started flying.  My trip to Jamaica a few years ago included me almost going nuts in the plane when it was in turbulance.  So, maybe its a combination of fear of death and fear of flying.  Anyway, I swore I wouldn't travel without Melissa on a plane again, she makes me feel more comfortable when I'm with her.  Awwwwwwwww.  Work beckons.
