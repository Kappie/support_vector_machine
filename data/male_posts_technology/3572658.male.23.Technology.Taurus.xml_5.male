Of course I have always liked architecture and I love the idea of designing and creating things. I think I am crazy, but I want to go back to school for architecture. Because I have just accepted this job, I think I will stay here and try it out. But the more I think about architecture and designing structures, the more I get excited about it.   Then I also thought about going to live in Hong Kong , and I have or trying  to go work for the FBI somewhere, or also going to live in someother cool city in the US, I think I just want to go live somewhere else for a while. I may end up back in BR, I may not. But I could go back to school for architecture but it doesn't have to be at LSU.  I dunno what Im gonna do. I just dont want to take life sitting down, and more importantly I want what God wants for my life. I am still trying to figure out what that it is! (If you know any details, let me in on 'em!)
