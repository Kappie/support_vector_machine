Worst stretch was the part along Scotts Rd as the crowd starts squeezing along the streets at Lido's side. As I hit Stevens Rd, the pavement I run along gets very close to the road itself to make it pretty unheathy to be breathing all the exhaust fumes from passing traffic. Effectively speaking I now have only 8 wks left to the event. Not very confident I can train myself up on time to finish the marathon, but I'll still try. Even then, I have Aikido grading the afternoon before. I'll be cutting things a bit close. If I really don't feel up to it, I may just sit out for AHM 2004. But I will definitely be training and aiming to attend.
