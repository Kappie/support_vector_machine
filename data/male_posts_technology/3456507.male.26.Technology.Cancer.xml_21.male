Jointly developed by Philips and Sony, the standard specifies a way for the devices to establish a peer-to-peer (P2P) network to exchange data. After the P2P network has been configured, another wireless communication technology, such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, can be used for longer range communication or for transfering larger amounts of data.   Here are some examples of how NFC can be used:   You could take pictures with a cell phone with a built in camera, and touch an enabled computer or television set to transmit the images for display;  You could download applications or games to a handheld device by touching the computer;  In conjunction with another wireless technology, you could transfer large files between two devices, such as a laptop and a desktop, simply by touching the two together.
