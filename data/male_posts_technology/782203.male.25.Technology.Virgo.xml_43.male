Kinda makes you realise how unpredictable life is; all it takes is one unforseen tragedy to turn your whole world upside down. And it also made me put my problems in perspective. I'm forever whining abt my lack of job opportunities and how boring my life is but maybe i should be grateful for the good things in my life, that i am healthy and that my family is healthy also. I think it's just human nature to focus on the negative aspects of our lives rather than the positive aspects. Well at least its mine.
