I like projects, and I like when I'm challenged and can sit and plug away, only to look at the clock and realize my day is already half over.  Summer is the slow time at my company.  Of course there's always "busy work," but without direction and without deadlines it allows me to slack to my heart's content, since nothing is really expected to immediately get done.  Most people complain about work, and I'm guilty too.  But I don't complain about working, I just complain about the work environment and attitude in general.  I've always said, I'm not against working, I just wish I had more flexibility.  People at work always complain about getting work assigned to them, sometimes I do too, but only for fun.  Really I would like to just tell them to shut up and do it.  Sometimes I'm tempted to ask for their assignments.    People are always drowning in work.  I don't get it.  Even during the busiest time of the year at work which I've always heard horror stories about, I never with a few exceptions felt overloaded.  I always get things done in a timely fashion.  I don't understand either when people talk about "job security."  I've talked about that in the past, how people get so used to their jobs that they fear losing them.  You've always heard of people who throw trash on the ground and say, "Oh it's job security for the city workers."  I was talking to someone at work telling them how I thought it would suck to be one of the people whose jobs it is to maintain old computer code in an obsolete computer language.  Not analysis in preparation for an upgrade, just fixing bugs and making sure things continue working.  He said it's good job security.  That's what I'm talking about.  Settling to do crappy brainless work.  I think if someone is that afraid of the prospect of moving forward because of the thought of working themselves out of their job, it's kind of sad.  I'm not trying to be judgemental, since I know some people are forced into jobs they dislike due to circumstances out of their control.  These aren't the people I'm talking about.  I know others suffer through jobs because they know ultimately it's in their best interest.  At least these people know there are other things to come.  Compromising is ok if you know what you're compromising and why you're doing it.  Sometimes I wish I would get laid off or fired because it would force me to move on.  Everyone is guilty of that sort of thing.  Needing to move on but putting it off because things are comfortable.  I don't really want to get fired, but having an excuse to do something new is good.  Being forced to do so makes you work things out.  And they usually always end up just fine.
