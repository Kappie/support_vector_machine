Would you like to participate in a gracious road rally through the Main Line with Porsche's, Mercedes and fellow Audi owners? Would you like to participate in one of the US's premier automotive show events? Now's your chance.  MAC/ACNA organizers strive to provide a variety of ways to 'join in' that reinforce our commitment to enhancing your Audi ownership experience through Lifestyle, Performance, Technology and Community events.  Through the outstanding support of Vision Audi of Reading, we have been invited to participate in the Radnor Concours Rally on Saturday September 11th, 2004. The Radnor Rally is a low key, fun event and is by mileage only - it is not timed. It starts at about 8:00am at the Radnor Hunt and ends no later than 2:00pm. Refreshments/Lunch and awards are included in the entrant fee of $50 per car (includes one driver and one passenger). MAC/ACNA members are welcome to participate with a guest and/or significant other. This event is designed to be congenial and fun! And, you'll get to see some of the world's finest automobiles!  Please contact me as soon as possible if you would like to join us. If you've never done something like this before, it's a great time to join in and try something different! For more details visit  urlLink www.radnorconcours.org .  Note that we need a minimum of 5 MAC/ACNA members to participate in order to have our own class (yep - an Audi class!) and we need to have participants signed up by Monday 8/23/04...  Please email me at danjackson@audiclubna.org if you would like to join in.  Thanks!  Dan Jackson MAC/ACNA
