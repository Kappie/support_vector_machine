Who won?  3.  Are you comfortable enough to urinate in front of another person?    (As before, Andrew at  NineMileDetour  receives my profuse thanks for being the mastermind behind these questions -- and to him I pledge my undying gratitude  adoration, and promise to repay his thoughtfulness by refraining from being my phenomenally sarcastic self on the first Tuesday of each month from hereon after.... maybe.)
