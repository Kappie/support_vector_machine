I don't know why, but I have never been able to say no to a hot chick asking me to play some lame ass online game. Anyway I am now hooked onto this lame ass game, but it has improved my vocabulary tremendously! Just today I have learnt 3 new words - gib, mor and hade. Gib is a castrated cat. I am going use that on someone today the next time I insult them. Thank you Literati.
