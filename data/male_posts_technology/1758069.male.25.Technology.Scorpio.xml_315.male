Smash: What do you think of Christianity?    it does boost god'sego, but somewhere along the line the whole thing got convaluted. it was supposed to be a really bitching weekly party, you know, to rest on the seventh. and now you all have fucked it up so bad that youonly have a tiny sip of alcohol and the onlything you do while on yourknees is pray. what is wrong with you people? jesus...     Smash: What is the meaning of life?    medammit, if i had a nickel for every time... the meaning of life is...        ted mcginley sit-coms.    Smash: How sick, exactly, IS your sense of humor?    have you seen the charlie's angels movies? all me.    Smash: Is this hell?    back to the charlie's angels movies....ever seen them back-to-back? over and over and over and over and over again into perpetuity? can you imagine what that's like? if not just ask brando.    thanks god for sharing with us today.    no problem man, you guys keep it real.now i have to go find jesus to make sure he's not fucking with the mexicans again by showing up in chalupas.       okay god, vaya con dios.    word to your moms.      album du jour:   jesus   and mary chain  automatic
