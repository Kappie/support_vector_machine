Think tommorow I am going to ask A if I can do something else; but then again I won't be coming on Monday cos i'm gonna collect my results for my heart ultrasound thingy so maybe I will ask him on Tuesday.   Also met with Mr. Vincent , one of the directors of the company in a rather imformal meeting where he just like briefed us about how we fit into the big picture.. And he was like he prefers us to address him by his name rather than call him Mr. Vincent. Apparently thats how the culture is like; it's cool but I dun know i find it a little weird. I still got trouble calling Appie without the Mr. in front. And he said we are also gonna get like both NTU and Sun passes and name cards so looking forward to that. Next time can use the namecards to pick up chicks ....chicks should be impressed by that right ?   "Yo yo whats up I am an associate engineer at *, here is my card , and I would really love to show you my engine sometime baby so call me !"   Can't wait to try that line out!  Shoutout: Diana I miss you already babe have a great time in UWA alright ...I will be waiting for you till you come back ....  Oh ok ya two things I learned in the past week. 1. There is a fine line between being funny and being downright annoying. 2. Never never never ever in under any circumstances poke fun at a friend's bf/gf .
