The peer sexuality support team is just part of a secondary health curriculum that actively promotes and supports the message to our teenagers that sex is okay at any age, at any time and with anyone as long as you use a condom.  Mr Vester’s school, like many other state secondary schools, peddles this advice under the guise of keeping our young people safe. Wake up parents – what happened at Edgewater College is consistent with the philosophy driving the Health curriculum in our schools.
