I mean I have a little "streeted out" Civic Si from hot wheels and a Gonzo pencil/pen top.  My boss has a few things from McDonalds but that's about it.  Doesn't this person have anything else to do?  I mean really.  This person didn't even do this sort of stuff last year!!!  Why now?  Is this a every other year thing?  Favoritism also plays a role.  There are certain individuals that play the dirty game of "office politics" and it's just ridiculous that they get away with shit that other people can't get away with.  Whatever I guess, it's always going to be there.  On a lighter note, there are two auditors that are sitting in the office behind me.  I guess they're alright looking.  One is tall and definitely bigger than me, I'm afraid of her.  She's got brown hair, wavy down a little below her shoulder line, about 6'0 to 6'1.  Looks like she used to maybe play basketball so she looks somewhat buff.  Yeah still afraid of her.  The other one has a nice booty but the face is alright.  Brown hair, wavy as well down to about her shoulders, about 5'8 with a skinny but nice hour-glass figure.  Yeah, nothing special but it's somewhat of an infusion of women that are "do-able" into the building I suppose.  A bunch of stuff has happened already today.  One of our servers keeps fucking up people's profiles and won't let them log in so I got a few issues regarding that.  A printer has been temperamental.  That's always a fun time.  If fun meant not fun.  Yeah, that was dumb.  I can't wait to see Meghan again.  I miss you sweetie.
