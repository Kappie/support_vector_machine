Anyone who has some free time on their hands, I need yal to feel me on this. I just need to get some things off my mind.   Sometimes I'm right when I'm wrong Sometimes I can hear when no one is talking Sometimes I can make music without striking a single chord Sometimes I'm white when I'm black Sometimes I may seem innocent when in fact i'm guilty...  Sometimes I see all men as one Sometimes I see one man as meaning the world Sometimes I'm hurting when I really feel good Sometimes I'm rushing when I don't have any place to go Sometimes I'm cool on the outside but green with envy on the inside...  Sometimes I feel like Superman when I really look like Shiznitt Sometimes I can fly without wings Sometimes bigamy is having too many women but sometimes monogamy is the same  So many thoughts, so many options Life can sometimes be viewed as this big game that everybody plays but rarely produces any winners. Sometimes we spend a lifetime just keeping our head above water, waiting for that lifeboat to save us  sail us away to safety. I guess the true winners are those that meet God halfway, giving their full effort to help themselves become at peace with the world around them, giving into no temptation but focusing on the goal  Sometimes its not that deep  Sometimes I'm going so fast the world isn't even moving Sometimes its not going to be arite Sometimes one can change their clothes  still sport the same colors Sometimes I'm wrong when i'm right  Whoa...
