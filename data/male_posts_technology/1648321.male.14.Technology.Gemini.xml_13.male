Yea! It is Friday! I can't wait for the weekend! :-) I am having a sleepover with Jacob Penn tonight. It will be so fun! I went to MPA's first annual Cultural Fair. It was really cool and funny and had good food! I went to Galyan's and I'm getting a Spider jacket 8-) Emi is coming on Sunday and we're going out to dinner! What fun!

Now here is what really happened:
The sleepover with Jake was really cool. We went to Blockbuster and rented F-ZERO GX - AWESOME GAME!!!!, Burnout 2: Point of Impact, and Enter the Matrix for GameCube. All the games rocked! We also rented Stuntman the DVD - also really good movie! Zack came over on Saturday morning. It was fun. On Saturday afternoon I went to tennis. I won King of the Court. Mindy baby-sat that night and Emi paid a short visit. Sunday I didn't have to go to church! (But instead I had to do homework and other jobs). I have to read The Foundation by Asimov (REALLY STUPID BOOK!!!!). I did work and jobs the rest of Sunday and Emi came and we went to Red Robin (the whole family). Laura, me, and Emi played 500 after we got home. Then she left and I studied for a few quizzes and tests and here I am right now. This week has 3 B days (YES!) and only 2 A days! Emi is coming to one of my soccer games. Well this is probably boring you so I'll say catcha L8er! ;-)
