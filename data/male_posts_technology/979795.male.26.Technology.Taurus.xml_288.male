Our earlier training runs were not as effective as we had thought. It was kinda disappointing as we had only gotten 6th and 8th placing out of the 14 teams. But I felt inspired, we had done out best and given our all for this run. I think the atmosphere and mood gave us a lot of pressure. A lot of us started the run too fast, I know I did. Just 100m or so and I knew there was no way I could keep up this pace and complete the race. To make things worse, the flag we were carrying though light, but was cumbersome. I carried it in a high-port stance similar to the way a rifle is carried. I should have used one hand to hold it instead. The first half of the race our 2 teams did extremely well and we were well ahead in 4th-5th placing. But as we went on we just got slower and slower. I also think that several units actually placed their better/faster runners at the end of the relay. The infantrymen from 3 and 6 SIR were truly inspiring. I wish I could train my legs stronger so I could've put up a better fight. Only 1 guy overtook me, despite my best efforts to sprint towards the end of the finishing line, I was just about to reach him when he gave a final boost and zoomed onwards. My mind and legs just couldn't go on. Right after, my muscles from the calves ached right up to my ass and there was a 'numbing' sensation. Most of us could hardly stand. Unbeliveable.  After the prize giving ceremony I tried to rush down to Siglap for Aikido. Unluckily the aircon had broken down and Sensei decided to end the class earlier at 9:10 pm, the time that I arrived. All I did was help to keep the mats and go on home for a well deserved ultra long weekend. He said I should feel free to visit any of the other dojos to train if I could make it from my camp in time. I'll probably try to work something out and pop by the other dojos to train more regularly.  Arrrrrghhh ... time to sleep. I'm sure I'll be feeling the effects of this evenings run in the morning.
