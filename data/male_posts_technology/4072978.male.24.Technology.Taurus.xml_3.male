This is a state where you can only dream about one thing OVER AND OVER AND OVER again.  This is probably my least favorite state of all, because usually, like this morning, I force myself to stay awake instead of going back to sleep to have the same dream for the fiftyth time just to wake up a couple minutes later.  Rinse, Dry, Repeat.  This usually happens to me when I do something in excess.  Usually that something is thought intensive like programming, Database design, or a strategy or adventure game.  Then the dream is about some problem that I am having in that area and I can not solve it in my dream, I wake up and when I close my eyes again I am almost instantly greated again with the same, or a variotion of the problem.   The only time I have ever been able to sleep again restfully is if I analyise my dream and find a solution to the problem.  Most of the time though the problem in my dream is abstract I can not think of any answer to the dream that will provide a resolution to the conflict in the dream.  Usually what I have to do is get whatever I have been doing out of my system by finishing it or exhausting myself so much that my nights are dreamless.  I've tried getting up for a while and waking myself up, drinking water, reading, taking my mind off of the matter, but nothing helps.  Does anyone else have this problem?  Does anyone else have a solution that works for them so they can get back to bed in short order?
