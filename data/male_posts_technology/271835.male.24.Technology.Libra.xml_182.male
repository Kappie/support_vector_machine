Interestingly, the article doesn't mention that GTA was originally intended as an Amiga game to be released in '95, but was dropped for the PC and PSX, due to the declining Amiga market.  pedantryThe BBC also manages to show it can't tell the difference between GTA - the game in question - and GTA3 - a much later fully-3D sequel./pedantry
