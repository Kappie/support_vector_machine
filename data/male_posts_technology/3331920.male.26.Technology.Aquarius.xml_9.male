The 'rubber strap' along the front end had been loose on one side, Fixed.  The maintenance light had been on forever, Fixed.  Safety inspection was expired, No more.  Oil in need of a change, Freshened up.    On the work front, the 'video-capture' torch has been passed.  I gave up my firewire card today so that someone else could handle video capture duties while i programmed ASP.  While programming ASP is about as exciting as clipping nails, it has to be done.    I should mention that Blake Sampson, the guy who owns the garage i went to today, gave me a hat for my dad.  Blake and my Dad hit it off pretty well when my Dad worked in the city.  My Dad is the baseball hat king so he'll be thrilled.  For years growing up i think i saw my Dad wearing a ballcap more often than not.  I cooked supper today.  I need to brag about that, but i also need to point out that my wife is definitely 'the cook'.  When i'm feeling particularly confident, or brave, i'll put on the apron and cook something really simple.  Today was one of those days.    For all my preaching about Triplets of Belleville, it went on sale today, and i didn't exactly run to the store to get it.  This week i'll probably pick it up, we'll see what happens.  I'm out.
