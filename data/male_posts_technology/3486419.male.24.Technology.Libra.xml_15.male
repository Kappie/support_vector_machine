In my 2.5years in Melbourne, I have met many, many encounters. I know its impossible to recollect everything, but I will try to dig up from my faithful memory bank of mine.  Starting of a chapter has always been a bumpy ride and its the courage to flip the next page, to face the next challenge, is what makes life worthwhile. In the process of the paper chase, one faces both poles of utmost trepidation and happiness. All these vast ranges of emotional changes are encapsulated into a whole package called student life.   Friends are what makes studying not that stressful. Especially in overseas university education, friends fade in and out. Mutual effort to keep the fire burning will sustain the friendship going.  Now that my exams are over and awaiting my "Official Results", I sub-consciously realised that despite the closure of one chapter, I should be feeling elated, but i am not. Strange? Perhaps, i know i am going to leave this place i have grown to love, the friends that i have made, the ups and downs I had.  Maybe, its the 'student mode' i am in, i can't exactly recall how stressed i was during assignments/exam period. Amazingly, what hovers around in my mind, are the fun,memorable times i had in Melbourne. All the lunch appointments :), thinking of where to eat, the jacket piercing cold weather @ brighton beach, the early sunday camberwell market, the 'no-destination' drive.... equates =  fond memories that I will never forget. Memories that i will never forget, memories that i will bring along, memories that i will tell my kids about, memories to recollect when i am old. All stashed and reserved in a little corner of my mind permanently.    M emoir, that i had so many,  E vanescent, my memories will not  D eparture, i can't bear to, Bravery, i know i need to don Friendship, i lest forget   Stanley
