What I've Been Doing:  School and being very tired and missing Kirsty an unbelievable amount. Hopefully I won't be in sports day - my team captain says he won't put me in unless he has to, so fingers crossed.  Episode 37 of Red vs Blue came out last night. Best one in a while. Quite long and lots of story too.  Kirsty is depressed :( She's got lots of coursework to do, can't see me all week and might not be able to go on a boat trip she's been wanting to go on for ages. If she can't go then I'll have to do something really nice for her (dunno what lol) and I'll try to make Saturday as nice as possible (next time I see her).  In the News:  Saddam Hussein is set to be handed over to the Iraqi authorities. He will be held in Iraqi cusotdy and tried by an Iraqi court for various crimes.  Militants in Iraq have released three Turkish men after they promised not to work for America again. It seems the militants are trying to keep in Arab nations' good books by letting Muslims go free whenever possible.  A woman has, for the first time, successfully conceived a child after having an ovary transplant.  A bodged terrorist attack resulted in the injury of three Turkish cleaners... A booby trapped bomb planted on board a plane exploded AFTER passengers had left the plane, injuring three cleaners.  Other Stuff:  Grrr... Still no email about Gmail. I need a new email address sharpish...  My mother laughed at the suggest of an allowance increase so I shall procure the money from my Grandmother's will every week. Tis my money anyway.  Apparently I am not allowed to use the phone upstairs anymore... Looks like my parents are trying to enforce rules again. I'm not having that. I shall continue to use it upstairs but I will now strive to phone mobiles instead of landlines and use it off-peak. Mwuhahaha. Also I haven't spoken to my friends in Denmark and the US in a while... I think a very long phone call to each one is in order...
