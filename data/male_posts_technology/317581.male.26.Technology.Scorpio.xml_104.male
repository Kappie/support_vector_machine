Monday, I went into a "Borders" and was like, "I want this book and this book and this book, and dammit they're out of this book that I also want to get". Then yesterday 2 books I order from Amazon finally arrived to be added to the pile of books to read. And then today, I got my advertisement from  urlLink SFBC  and was like, I want this book and that book and....  You get the idea, I need to stop reading so damn much:)
