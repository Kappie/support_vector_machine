I can't stop the tears. I wrote a poem that I'm going to put to music and make a song.   Haunting Me So Sad   I'm Thinking about you now Stuffed animals and teeshirts Happily ever after stories Somehow it always hurts  I miss you so much now Missing Thunder, missing Blue How we used to go hiking How we learned, how we grew  (Chorus) All my dreams and inspirations All my trials and tribulations All my scenes and situations All my troubles and frustrations Haunting me so bad Haunting me so sad   I dreamed of you again Dreamed of Thunder, dreamed of Blue Happy times spent together All the things we used to do  My life's so empty now Barren desert surrounds me Rusted spirits, broken soul Haunted dungeons, never free  (Chorus)
