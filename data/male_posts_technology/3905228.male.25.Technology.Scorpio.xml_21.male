I can come out of this with a little more heartbreak than I have now.  But is this what I want after being so much involved ?  Rejected.  2. I know she is the one - how to make her realise I'm the one.  I need to rekindle it by being dettached. It might be a success or it can also be the other.  So a couple of rules before I go, what do you think?  1) No expectations. I am not expecting this effort to rekindle or solve anything. It is just what it is a relationship with someone I really enjoy being with.  2) No baggage. I am leaving every flaw, criticism, pain, and heartache at home. No way am I bringing it on this one as there is no point.  3) No begging. This is not a time to plead my case or in anyway convince her that I am the one for her. The only way she can learn that is through my actions and seeing me as fun again.  4) No tension. This can only make things worse. There is no point talking or brooding about the relationship or lack thereof while there.  5) No return . I am treating this  effort  as if we were coming back to separate lives (a amorous rendezvous if you will). This way I have no expectations of continuation of what happens on this one.  Max will now play the game according to the rule set.   For anybody who is worried about his/her other half's past - a piece of my mind to U    "At what point is someones past too much?" Thats easy. The point that you can't handle it. Set up a scale in your head. On one side, put the way you feel about the things you like about the person. On the other side, put the way you feel about the persons past. If you can't find a way to balance the two, or make it so the good of the person means more to you than the persons past, then you probably need to leave them alone. All some time , In any case, you don't have to decide now. You've still go time to get to know this person more. The solution will become more and more apparent the better you know her/him ...  My way thoughts - It's unfair to expect or demand someone to behave the way we would like them to, to really love is to accept and appreciate who they are, to acknowledge their minor faults (not abuse/infedility) and that they are human.  The question from me to U -  which is more important to U - Is it more important 'to be in love with' or 'to love' each other?  To love: is to care about someone in ways that you devote yourself to that person.  To be in love: is to feel your heart beating because you are attracted (physically or spiritually or by whatever ways) to that person.  To be in love describes the excitement, passion, and sense of worth that a person experiences when they are involved with someone. It is a personal experience.  To love someone means that you give them care, concern, friendship and affection willingly. You respect them, understand that they are as human as you and do make mistakes, but that they are a good, capable, responsible person whom you enjoy spending time with. Your affection does not wane with distance, and you do not grow bored of them with time. Neither do you idealize them.  Max thinks he has given more of a lecture / advice and time to stop !
