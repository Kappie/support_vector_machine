Winfield, who played for the University of Minnesota, was the Gophers' best hitter and pitcher, not a shabby achievement considering Minnesota made it to the semis of the 1973 College World Series. After 22 major-league seasons -- he never played in the minors -- Winfield was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2001, his first year of eligibility.  But there's more. He was also good enough to play pro basketball, drafted by both the Atlanta Hawks and the Utah Stars after starring as a power forward on Minnesota's Big Ten championship team. And he was such a great athlete that even though he never played a single down in college, the Vikings selected him in the 1973 draft. No other athlete has ever been drafted in all three pro sports.
