I have visited over 15 sites discussing resumes and cover letters examples, interviews tip, Hi-Tech jobs and even the body language.  I've prepared me two copies one for the Hi-Tech career and the other is for whatever i might find as an interesting job beside HI-Tech. I think i've sent some 30-40 copies to different Hi-Tech companies, human resource companies and others.  There seems to be some kind of recovery in the Hi-Tech field.. It has been a year or two since i last encountered such a mass of openings. I can be positive and optimistic but leery about this. I don't think i should start building any expectations what so ever.  God... I need a job before i go crazy.  HELP!    One more thing that i noticed while i was searching for jobs was that there is a new technology, two technologies actually, the first is called   J2EE  , not really a new one but a "young" one, and it is very   IN   right now and so is   GUI  . Most of the companies require the knowledge in these two technologies regardless the job definition. Any applier should be able to control at least one of them, experience is not always required though, knowledge is.    J2EE   and   GUI   are going to occupy me for the next couple of weeks. I've found some good sites with good materials, lessons, tutorials and code samples. I just need to install the tool kit in order to practice both theoretical and practical. Hey, what the hell?! I'll give it a try. I've managed JDBC so i think it'll be a piece of cake for me.  Oh, one more thing before i go,  REMEMBER TO CALL ADEEB CONCERNING THE INTERVIEW .
