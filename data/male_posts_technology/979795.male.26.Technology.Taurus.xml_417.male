Paired with the beginner (don't know his name, husband to the Eurasion lady) for starters. I had didfficulty with him for the the usual back-bending exercise. Richard came over and gave a few pointers. I should just do what I usually did. I wasn't extending my arm properly and it gave my uke a lot of difficulty. For one thing, as a beginner, he already feels unsure about what he should do. SO if I don't help him along (natural, normal movements) he won't be able to follow properly. It's good to work with beginners because they don't have an idea of the movement, hence if they don't follow properly it probably means I'm the one who failed to guide them in properly. Well, I kept in mind on removing the uke's 'should' and 'should not' movements from my mind and proceeded. I found that he does follow much better in fact (by beginner's standards).  After that we did Shihonage. Realised that the husband was more stiff compared to his wife. I would point out somethings about his stance and the technique and thought he sometimes nods, he simply stands there and wait. One step at a time, I suppose. Helped him to take note of which leg to roll and how to hug his head to his arm as uke. As nage, there was more difficulty telling him how to bring me down. Pointed out to him that he needed to make my elbow point to the sky, and the bringing me down motion was something I don't think he managed to grasp at all last night.  After we split up beginners and coloured belts. Coloured belts was going into a slam. Richard wanted to make it a slam I think, but I just wasn't confident enought for it as uke. He said we could go for a rolls first. (He said he would've shown us if his leg wasn't injured.) I think I did kinda manage to do a decent slam (God knows how) just once. But never managed to repeat that success again. I was trying to get the feeling or re-experience it again. Wasn't successful. Never mind, next time. In future, think I'll need to arrive earlier and practice some slamming exercise/warm-ups before classes.  Got the name of the Indian chap, Vic. While doing kokyu-ho he says he notices my 'technique' is different from what most of the others are doing. Don't exactly know what he meant but we basically exchanged hp no.s for the purpose of exchanging Aikido clips/VCDs in future.
