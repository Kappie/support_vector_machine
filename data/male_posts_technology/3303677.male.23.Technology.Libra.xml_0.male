I really wish I wouldn't get fired for using the classic line of "A lack of proper planning on your part, doesn't constitute an emergency on mine".  I hate policies that regard grooming. I really think that having picked the new boss with the military background might have been a bad idea. Now policies are getting put in place that govern how hairy my face is allowed to be, and we might not get to wear shorts this summer. I really hope the one with the shorts gets put in place, that way I can take whoever came up with the idea and have them walk around with me in 100+ degree heat, wearing pants and a thick ass shirt and see if they change their mind. Ah the joys of work.  I also think I fixed my ankle. Special thanks to the power cord for that one. Anyway all in all not to bad of a day. I am sure my evening will be better. I get to spend it with someone I really care about. Anyway it is time to put up the golf carts and almost time for me to go home from work.
