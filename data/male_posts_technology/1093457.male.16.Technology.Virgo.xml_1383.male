Beckett seems convinced that fluffy steering was part of a man's car, and all these nice cars have rubbish steering. (Before any of you have a go at me, I am aware that Beckett can't get a Jaguar, the point I'm making is that he thinks his steering is the best and that proper steering is boring.)  Proper steering is the one where you can feel the road as you go round tight corners. Fluffly steering is when you require very little effort to turn the wheel; fluffly steering is also when you can turn the wheel from full left-lock to full right-lock without moving the car.  I successfully proved him wrong by driving around the car park using my pinky finger only on the steering wheel, then turn the wheel right round without moving the car (doesn't did the tires any good, but I was proving a point dammnit!).  He later proved himself wrong by driving around that tight corner on the Caterham by-pass, only with his pinky finger on the steering wheel.  Thomas 1, Beckett 0.
