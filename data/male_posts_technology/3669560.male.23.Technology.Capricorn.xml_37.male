I write things that are meaningful and important to me; you ignore the deeper semantic meaning and go straight for the syntax errors. With each one you find, I get a little closer to crying. It's like an easter egg hunt that destroys my self-esteem.   And since the spell-check button on my pages doesn't work at all, it would appear that this is an officially sanctioned event of blogger.com.
