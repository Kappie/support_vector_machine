While the story is very inspirational, I thought it too sad and many of the pictures too grotesque.  Then I downloaded and watched the PowerPoint presentation provided by the site, and I changed my mind.  We seem to need to be constantly reminded what a bad idea drinking and driving is.  Bumper sticker idea: "Drinking and driving: This shit simply has to stop."
