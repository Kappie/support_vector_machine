My shin splint pain was reduced to a point I could run without much pain so I took off on a 50-60 minute run last night.  I got to run what is becoming one of my favorite courses in my area.  Madison to Grandin to Erie to Observatory to Madison  The weather was great last night except for the occasional artic wind that would come and slow my progress up hills.  My body went through its usual ache checks and nothing seemed out of place or to be hurting too much.  There was a constant dull ache in my right shin but it was not something that got significantly worse as I ran.  Actually, to Brad's credit, it did begin to feel a little better once it got warmed up and stretched out more around miles 2 and 3.  My legs still are not cheerful about downhills, but we're getting there.
