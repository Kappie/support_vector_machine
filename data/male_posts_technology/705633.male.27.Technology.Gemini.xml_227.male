No, it wasn't a mid-coital experience (if only…) but shock and amazement at the soft glow that shrouded every outdoor item, the trees, the birds, the houses, the dirty old man in the trench coat behind the bushes, the cars… Yes folk, Its SUNNY. If still a bit wet. But Sun it was. And with that shocking display off astronomical certainty I even cycled to work without a jacket. Made my nipples pointy, but hell. I like it. Good thing to, with my orange shirt (its Wednesday, Wednesday = Orange shirt day) only one idiot in an estate car, padded out to hold dogs in the back, no doubt wearing socks :-) attempted to ignore me on my bike. Good job I swerved to miss that puddle, I could have been nice and let her drive by ignorant to the fact that she must be blind not to have seen my arse on the road.  Ho hum. Today the faint snivelling of a cold has come back, funny, it didn't exist yesterday, maybe she was too busy to fake it.  For those of you who care, today, on a scale of one to take the mickey out of Americans, she scores Starship Troopers.
