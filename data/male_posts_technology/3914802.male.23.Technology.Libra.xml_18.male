He would mix rediculous shit together, or maybe he bought a mix already done like that. I am not sure which idea is worse. Either way, it would switch from Bon Jovi to Usher, and then to some mix of  urlLink Like a Prayer  with something electronic, and it sounded awful. It wasn't a good mix... it was more of like one of those mixes you can  urlLink find for free on the internet . Anyways, the drink specials were good, domestic drafts for 1 dolla, and rail for 2. It allowed me to get pretty messed up for cheap. Some people were walking around with bottled beer (which was being sold for 4 dollars+ for the same shit) which I didn't understand when the specials were going on.  Maybe there is some special allure for bud light in a bottle that makes it better than a draft bud light. I think it all tastes like sugar water, but is carbonated. I will drink it... don't get me wrong. Some times are right for Guiness and some others.. it is Miller Time (I don't really like budweiser at all).  I later came back to the apartment with my friends RM and JM, and watched some  urlLink Last Comic Standing . KC went to Lulu's too but he went home with his girly friend so RM stayed in his bed.  The next day I used RM and JM's presence to ease my fear of playing Doom3. That game is freaky. It has gotta be good if you are afraid to play it alone in the dark right? Anyways, I found that dead people on the ground need to be shot up or else they will "wake up" and go after you. Also, when going up against a fire throwing demon, I scream like a little girl if unprepared. One came at me when all I had was a flashlight out. The game doesn't seem to let you carry a flashlight and a gun at once. I guess because you can use a flashlight as a weapon, but who really wants to get that close to one of the demons trying to kill you anyways? I told them that I would have to invite others over if I want to play the game because it is a scary game. It makes me feel kinda wuss-like, but I can't help it... the game roxors with the scariness.  That night I went to a keg party (kegger) at my friend EW parent's house that I haven't been to in ages. Lots of people from high school were there and it was awesome. Most of the people there I knew from high school. A few like EW I knew from before. LH I know since 1988 or 7 when he moved next door to me, EW I knew in summer camp when I was growing up and then in high school, and JC from like 2nd grade or something like that. I thought it was funny that EW's girl put up a picture of his penis on the refridgerator, but he took it down after a while. There was beer bongin' and quarters playing, it made me reminicent of the times in high school and beyond of our drinkin parties. MF was soo messed up he was like... humping people and stumbling all ova da place. My friend TG spent the night with this chick and though he was puking beforehand he stumbled into the room and woke up naked... although he doesn't really remember anything. But it is all good because she had sex with him again to remind him the day after. Strangely enough, this is the sister of someone else we went to high school with (well... I guess she went there too but later) she was a hottie, her name was BH. I believe she now has one kid and a kid on the way (I guess she just likes to fuck?). I went to the mall and hung out with my other friend SC on Sunday she's so cute and is often easily distracted. I was going to hang out with LH but he was striking the set of the show he was a stage manager (SM) for.  But I will see him this weekend, since I have to go house sit for my parents. I might have to throw a house party, but I would need to clean a hell of a lot first. My parents are pack rats of all kinds of things. It will be interesting to say the least.
