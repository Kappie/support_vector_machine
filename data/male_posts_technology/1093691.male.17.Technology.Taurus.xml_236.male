Yes, yesterday. Ah, yesterday. Fond memories. An educated hour or so wandering around art galleries, taking in some culture. Especially that of the Tudors whose paintings all look the same. Then a five minute brisk walk through a rather pathetic peace protest. Well, they did try. And we were attacked by a few pigeons and we all now what pigeons mean. Then a wonderfull 2 and half hours of Freddie and Chris. Feel free to take Freddie Jo, Chris is mine. Hehe. I think his hair suited his character. Maybe it will be cut now they have finished the play. Or maybe his next film requires long hair. Who knows. Who knows why Mary owned a little lamb. Who knows.
