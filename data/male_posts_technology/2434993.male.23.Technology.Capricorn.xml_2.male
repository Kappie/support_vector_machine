Starting April 1, CodeProject is pleased to offer Visual Studio .NET developers the chance to win one of five HP 4150 iPaqs in our Mobile Developer competition. The 4150 comes with WiFi, Bluetooth, SD card slot and a 400MHz processor, all in a tiny convenient package. The 4150 is truly a sweet machine.   We want to raise awareness of just how easy it is to write applications for Mobile Devices using Visual Studio .NET. You don't even need a device. Just write your application using Visual Studio .NET and test using the in-built emulator. If you want us to test your application on one of our 4150's then we'll be more than happy to help you out.   Entries close May 30.
