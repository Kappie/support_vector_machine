     
      And bureaucracy hates you.  Oh yes.  It hates you with a blinding, seething, murderous rage.  Its fingers itch with longing to wrap around your soft, fragile neck and twist it with such violence that your tongue hangs loose and your eyes roll back and all goes white and pale and you slide once and for all into total oblivion.  Bureaucracy hates you, Miss Contentment.  It wishes nothing more than your desperate, fruitless clawing at empty air as you come face to face with your sad, painful, pathetic destiny.  Bureaucracy hates you.  And it will find you.  And you will know despair.
