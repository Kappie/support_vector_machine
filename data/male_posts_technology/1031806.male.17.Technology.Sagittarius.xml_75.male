I just realized that I saw Goody for the first time in like, two weeks today.  After church, I messed around on the stage which is being suddenly transformed into several streets in New York (a backdrop for an upcoming play -  The Cross and the Switchblade , opening next Wednesday).  I spent the afternoon with the Gadaholts and [a really cool guy who's in the Coast Guard, and I can't remember his name for the life of me, but I'll edit this post later with it when I remember it].  We went to Taco Bell, where I made myself mad by continuousely spilling parts of my taco on my trench coat, and then progressed back to their house, with Mrs. Vanhorn (the wife of one of our pastors) and her grandchildren.  We had some fun making very loud booms with Uncle Greg [Gadaholt]'s spud cannon, but eventually put it away in fear of the wrath of the neighbors. :)  I then came back home and started working on backed up homework that I had from before Christmas break, and that's what I'm still doing right now.
