But gunfire and explosions crackled across Najaf ( urlLink search ) after the deal was announced and there was no indication of whether there could be a quick end to two weeks of fighting between al-Sadr's forces and U.S. soldiers and government troops in this holy city.  urlLink http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,129379,00.html
