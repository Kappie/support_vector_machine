But much more than my perception changing, my voice has changed. While my perception has changed over time, the final straw to set me into trying to accurately portray the charade we call democracy is the creation of Free Speech Zones. I love the terminology. And it's so easy to see the terminolgy written into the First Amendment. My guess is it took the Ministry of Truth about 20 seconds to re-write that amendment. Could you have imagined our history for the last 230 years if King George had just implemented Free Speech Zones? It certainly would have avoided that ugly Boston Tea Party scene. I want to take my country back, and restore democracy for future generations. And despite my inclination to believe that most Americans are too fat, dumb, and lazy to actually question the process, I must make the effort. For democracy is a beautiful thing, but like any other form of government, it is easily perverted and manipulated by the wealthy and powerful. Certainly I will be labeled as seditous, traiterous, an extremist, etc. Because I will not believe the spin doctors and the frigid pawns of the tyrannical, I will be, in thier eyes, committing Thought Crime. I will be the enemy of the right, and the enemy of the left, but most of all, I will be the enemy of those that hold keys to the tyranny that is to be subjected upon the unquestioning masses. I will not let lies and deceit continue to go unnoticed, and unquestioned, and unpunished.  There is nothing in Room 101 that can scare me, because the death roll of democracy in the jaws of the powerful is more damaging to my soul than any physical pain or mental anguish they could subject me to. I think for myself.  I love my country.  I love democracy. I love freedom.  I am their enemy.
