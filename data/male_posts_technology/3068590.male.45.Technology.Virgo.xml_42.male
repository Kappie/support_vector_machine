And the political environment appears to have struck a measured and reasonable solution to the moral and ethical decline in corporate America. The scope of this corporate issue is significant, with its implications bringing into question many fundamental assumptions that the markets are based upon. Nonetheless this legislation is having some internal political dynamics that were unexpected and undefined when the legislation was passed.   The unintended consequences are that a distinct division in the accountability within the organization has formed. With the CEO's and CFO's having signed all of the financial data in terms of the responsibility and accountability of its accuracy, the individuals responsible have been identified and are limited, in my opinion, in there ability to defend their actions in the future. The consequences of a breach are probable jail time. The evidence necessary to trigger the conviction being the signature of the CEO and CFO on the document.  The remedial methods at the CEO and CFO's disposal is an increased role of the internal audit controls and the increased emphasis on the annual audit.  Where are the directors in this process? Are they provided a free pass? The organization certainly has attained a pass, in that they have now been stripped of the responsibility and accountability of the accuracy and integrity of the corporate data that they prepared. That does not suggest they are involved in some criminal conspiracy, however, their diligence in identifying and reporting any inappropriate actions may be diminished in the legislations focus on the key principles in the organization.   When this issue is added to the decline in loyalty of staff within organizations, the focus of employees becomes more personal with their pensions, benefits and income taking priority over any and all organizational issues. I would also extend this to include individuals who have budgetary control are affecting the long term perspective of the organizations development and operations.   This long term issue is manifest through the commitment of the organization in any long term improvement. These committments and objectives are and should be the premier concern of those with budgetary control at this time of globalization. These employees are not that interested in engaging in difficult or controversial organizational tasks, and undertaking any risks that could affect their compensation. Therefore organizations are undertaking limited, if any, long term strategic or operational changes.   The identification and solution to this issue has not appeared in the market at this time. What the ultimate resolution will be is undetermined and is of great concern. This concern stems from the probable amendments to the legislation being impossible due to the fact that any change would be sending the wrong message.   If the enforcement of Sarbanes Oxeley is a political issue, does that impute that enforcement is a direct accountability of the president of the United States?
