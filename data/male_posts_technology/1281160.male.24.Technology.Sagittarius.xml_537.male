Hope u all to enjoy reading it! ***********************************************************************    It is rarely that a phenomenon takes place in the world. An epoch-making event of far-reaching consequence that would change the course of history. The advent of sages, saints, great men of science, sacred men of art, have all heralded new beginnings in their respective realms. In the world of Indian art music, the advent of Shyama Sastri, Thyagaraja and Muthuswami Dikshitar changed the course and perception of music. The harbingers of a new age in classical music, the threesome are reverentially referred to as the Trinity of Carnatic music. Not without reason, the foremost of which was their being born in the same town and being contemporaries. But this was not the only reason. Their pioneering work was such that after their times, Carnatic music was never the same again.   Looking at their works, one finds a unity of purpose behind them. This unity of purpose is reflected in the fact that the Trinity refined the medium of the kriti and made it into a wholesome entity. They also brought into vogue several ragas that had fallen into oblivion. That they adopted almost the same methods and utilised the same tools speaks volumes about this unity of purpose. All the more reason why, they are hailed as incarnations whose specific task was to elevate the art form into a true rasAnubhavA. The art form as an experience that would ennoble the heart and lift the soul of man to greater heights. The purpose of an incarnation is to transcend and transform. Shyama Sastri, Thyagaraja, and Muthuswami Dikshitar transcended the mundane and transformed the way music was handled. The Trinity proved to the world through their music and through their exemplary lives, that the sole purpose of music was to make man perfect and help him realise his unity with God.     ***********************************************************************  (Jax: Since i got this interesting info thru mail and dont know from where its taken, i have pasted the entire article and so couldnt have link alone) A very good introduction on Muthuswami Dikshitar compostions is available in a semi classical-fusion album   Panchabuthams   featuring carnatic vocalist Bombay Jayashree, it contains compositions themed on the five elements. L. Vaidyanathan has composed the music with contemporary orchestration, while the rendition of the krithis is purely carnatic.   I happened to listen to this Casette. Hei do u people know that its brought by "Dinamalar" paper? Ya really surprised and indeed felt happy to see that such good music albums are supported and Canvassed by one of the popular daily. Supera irukku indha casette. U people need not know carnatic to listen to such songs, but then any good listener could see the beauty in each rendition. Its about 5 elelments of Nature. There are five songs , one each for Agni - Fire, Akash -Space, Vayu- Air, Anila-Water, Prtihvi -Earth and each song, preceeded by a hymn from rig veda. Actually its sung in praise of the Lord siva, who is represented in the form of five elements at five different temples in TamilNadu. A descriptive back cover helps us to learn more about the renditions.   So hope u people to plunge urself into some good and different music in days to come.  Till then  its bye !
