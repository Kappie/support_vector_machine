Argh, really need to get ready earlier next time. I feel so bad / guilty for not going when I could have. I really don't know how this kind of attitude of mine is gonna help my Aikido development in future. So sad. Need to put in more effort. And the distance to the dojo doesn't really help either. It's not near like in Uni. Even though Uni has a free bus ride down, just traveling down to Uni and waiting for the (long wait) bus is a real put off as well. But I know that once I get myself down to the dojo I won't regret the training and I'd be glad to have put in the effort. Sometimes I seem to treat my Aikido training like a convenience. Seems like I go down only when I can go down easily. Shouldn't be the case. I think from next week onwards, I'm gonna bring my Gi around sch for the day so that I can leave from Uni direct. And I gotta liase with a senior to go down together. That shall be my level of commitment. Dat's what I'll do!!
