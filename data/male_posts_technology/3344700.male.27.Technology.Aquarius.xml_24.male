I really appreciate the work done by this guy to collect all the important topics and providing related links from MSDN and consolidated those as a book of reference. This is very good one and would benefit all developers who are planning/preparing for .NET Certifications.  PS: This is not a Brain-Dump.  It contains all the required topics  references for the following exams:  #70-229 (Designing and Implementing Databases with Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Enterprise Edition) #70-305 And #70-315 (Web Applications with VB.Net and C#) #70-310 And #70-320 (Web Services with VB.Net and C#) #70-300 (Analyzing Requirements and Defining Microsoft .NET Solution Architectures)  go check out the  urlLink   Certification Stuff     All the very best Guys!
