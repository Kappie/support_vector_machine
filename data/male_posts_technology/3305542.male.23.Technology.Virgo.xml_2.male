    
       I am taking a week of vacation, which will be spent relaxing on the beaches of Cancun.  We will be flying out of Chicago at 6:00am on Saturday, May 22 and returning a week later (2:30pm Saturday, May 29).  I am going with my friend Jamey Byom and his roommate.  Visit Jamey's site  urlLink here .  I will be spending the next couple weeks packing for the trip.  I can't wait!  I'll be sure to post the highlights of the trip.  Hopefully I can find a place to post while I'm down there.  Otherwise, you'll just have to wait.
