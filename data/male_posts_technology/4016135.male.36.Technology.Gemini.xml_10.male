We had a little spat this morning over something insignificant, but it was enough to put us both in a bad mood going out the door for work. So, imagine my surprise when the receptionist in the lobby called to tell me I had a delivery, and there they were. A big bouquet of flowers, in a PINK vase no less.  Now, when you send your wife/girlfriend flowers at work, you, as the guy, feel pretty cool. You're showing your woman some love and all her little work friends go "oooh" and "ahhh" over how lucky she is to be with such a sensitive and thoughtful guy.  When guys receive flowers at work, you grab them and run back to your desk in the desperate hope that no one sees you. First of all, you have to answer the nosey receptionst's questions: "Who are they from?", "What's the occasion?". Here's a question from me. How about you mind your own damn business? So, you make up some lame answer. Uhhh, they're from...my mom.   So, after ditching the receptionist, you grab the bouquet AND teddy bear (gack!) and hurry back to your desk, taking the path that you think will be best to avoid contact with anyone, which means out the front door, around the building, in the back where the loading dock is, through a back door. Luckily you don't run into your boss, or the one co-worker who has to know EVERYTHING and then proceeds to tell everyone else in the company.  You escape detection in the halls and now you're back to your desk, only there is no place to hide the flowers. Instead, you're forced to put them on the desk, partially hidden behind the computer monitor and risk the rest of the day all passers-by doing a double-take and asking you who sent them to you and what the occasion is. It's not like being able to proudly display your favorite action figure that you can bend in all sorts of manly poses. Good luck at the end of the day when you try to sneak them all the way to your car to go home. Try getting that far without being seen.   I think the wife and I have to have a little talk after work about this. Somewhere in the handbook for men, there is a rule that states:  Article 5, section 10, paragraph 4: At no time shall flowers be delivered to the man's location of employment. Penalty for such action can result in revokation of the official man card and reinstatment no more than 6 months from such time.
