We should all forego comments and return to carefully blogging responses -- including responses we disagree with, but excluding responses we cannot tolerate."  It's an interesting viewpoint, that is hard to disagree with on the face.  Comments appear out of context with a commentor's other posts, thus are almost always read without an ability to make a judgement on the posters credibility.  I could see this causing a greater instance of flame-like posts.  It seems it would be a shame to lose the directed dialogue traits that have become so much of the blog format.  Perhaps what's really needed is an author feedback system, perhaps tied in with a system like  urlLink typekey  that would let you see how many other comments an author has made, and how people ranked him.  Maybe some kind of averaging between how people ranked the author's weblog  his comments.
