We drank and played guitars and sang. it was a lot of fun. damn I've been drinking way too much. let's see Friday Saturday Sunday Monday and now Wednesday. At least it's fun. I've been feeling good lately. The band sounds good. I'm happy for Jeff that he's feeling better. I should be actually applying my skills at work soon and I got some work done for my dad and brother.  Songs in my head today: Dinosaur Act - Low, The New Year - Death Cab For Cutie, Better Off Without a Wife - Tom Waits
