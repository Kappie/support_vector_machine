After much deliberation on the idea of the Ice Cream Sundae (if anyone can tell me why they are called this i would be immensely grateful!) i have decided to start a tradition of my own, on a Friday, by far the best day of the week, as all who aren't bums (unemployed) or professional bums (students) will testify.  By creating a range of alcoholic ice cream and ice lolly based alcoholic treats i hope to bring inebriation and refreshment to the masses at the same time. Current ideas include Lager Floats, Vodka Screwballs, JD and coke lollies and Tequila Traffic lights. Feel free to let me know any ideas or possible trademark infringement!  /Monkey Power!
