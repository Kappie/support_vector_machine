He just hated living so far out east because, in his words, its too much of a hassle to drive to work in Reynoldsburg, then go to school at OSU, and then drive to the gym, and then drive all the way back to [Easton]. Well. I guess since he doesnt have a freaking job anymore, 1/3 of that statement has no bearing anymore, huh?                OK, so what does Mr. I-Hate-Living-So-Far-From-All-The-Other-Fags do? He moves in with his 19 year old friend in REYNOLDSBURG! Ill say that again, R-E-Y-N-O-L-D-S-B-U-R-G. For those of you who do not know Columbus and environs, Reynoldsburg is an east side suburb that is about 4 miles FARTHER east than Easton (where we live now).                Im not even gonna get in to the fact that he moved in with a 19 year old, and hes twenty-eight. Not even gonna mention it.                Idiot.
