Here's some context: The same definition of terrorist activities would also apply through cross-referencing provisions, see 18 U.S.C. § 2711(1) and 3127(1) (as amended), in the chapters of the criminal code that govern accessing stored communications and the use of  pen registers  and  trap and trace devices  (chapters 121 and 206).   (emphasis added)
