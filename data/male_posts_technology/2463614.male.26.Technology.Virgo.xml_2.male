And here is the obligatory first post.  :)    To give you fair warning this blog will concentrate mostly on issues that affect software developers.  C++ is my  lingua franca  so expect programming related topics to focus on that beast of a language.     I'll be covering things like:  sound design principles, tips on using various tools and how to figure out what happened when Things Go Wrong.      It's likely I'll go off on many tangents - don't fight it, just hang on and enjoy the ride.  :)
