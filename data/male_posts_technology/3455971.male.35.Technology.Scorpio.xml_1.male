Also brought the last Muse album, Absolution.   Anyway, I hate malls, hate shopping (apart from when it's too buy guy stuff I suppose. You know, electronic equipment, xbox games etc etc). Friend picked me up and all I did was bitch and moan about how much I hate bloody malls and people bumping into you and why the fuck did she have to park the car at the furtherest point from where we were currently at?  Wasn't till we got to the car she mentioned that she'd been told her Ma's got the worst heart prob and the docs only give her 10% chance of surviving the op to fix it. That's WITh the heart strengthening medication they've started giving her before they do it. If that doesn't work, it goes down to 5%.  I am a fucking schmuck boy. Do I know when to stick my foot in it or not!?
