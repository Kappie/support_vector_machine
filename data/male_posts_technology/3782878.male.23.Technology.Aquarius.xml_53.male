She gave me some of her enhancements as well, we hugged, and she took off. Meanwhile I began to hear murmurings of activity from our Guild, and it sounded like they were on a quest, and all of them were within my experience. I asked them if they had space for a paladin, and they said they had one space left. I jumped at it, and ran to Gunthak.   In Gunthak I received more enhancement and then invisibility, so we could run past all the man eating plants in the tunnels towards Dulak. Today, we were to assualt the Mines of Torgiran. We went to find Teeo's, our ranger, Sharpened Mining Pick. We spent a lot of time in those mines with Rmdir, Jael, Vyoletta, Teeo, and Kary. No Pick ever did show, Rmdir eventually had to setup camp, and we wished him fare well. Aminea then joined our group, with his mighty "puppy" a Gigantic Grizzly Bear. and we proceeded to kill the miners who were lost to mental instability, and rescued those miners who would fight the evil of the mines. we killed many Guards as well, and eventually Vyoletta, Aminea, and Jael Left, and we picked up Qali, Dextrin an iksar monk, the first one I've ever met, and Wildlily. Qali did not stay long, and left eventually, and Jael returned. We fought a bit longer, then Dextrin left us. So we were short one person of a full group, so Akcron decided to come!, and so Jael Left and Qali returned, and Akcron was guided to Dulak by Lily, while the Ranger Teeo Camoflaged me and told me to run like the dickens.   I ran all the way to zone, as Teeo said often his camoflage would fail. It suprisingly held fast on me. and I made it all the way to the entrance of Gunthak, and waited for the others. Teeo was not as lucky, as he attempted to camoflage himself, it kept failing him, and he accidently snared himself. Once he was snared, his Camoflage held, and he began to slowly crawl to us, dragging his feet due to the snare spell. Camoflage eventually dropped, and Teeo died. I mourned his loss, but Akcron resurrected him. We then made way to the docks, to kill dock hands in attempts to find a black medallion that was lost out in Dulak for Millius Darkwater.   So I start baiting everything I can find, and things are going so well Akcron gets her pouty face on showing me her boredom. So I decide to give her and myself a work out, and perform what many refer to as the Ziggur Pull. I taunted 3 Treasure Sorters from their tables inside the warehouse, and ran back for the group. When I got there, 3 more arrived. I was in shock, but kept trying to keep track of all the enemies and keep them focused on me. Akcron started to scream in panic, and I setup to lay my hands on her wounds, but she died before I got there. I mourned for her, but kept fighting, while the Enchanter Qali attempted to stave off the enemies with her mesmerizing spells. That also failed, and she began to yell out in pain, I ran across to her, but she too was dead before I could lay hands. Without an Enchanter and a Cleric, I was naked as a newborn baby dwarf. I took as much of the damage as I could, before Brell took me from the fight, placing me back inside Plane of Knowledge.   Suprisingly I discovered the Druid Lily, the Shadowknight Kary, and the Ranger Teeo both did not die. the Druid apparently shielded them and killed off the additional trolls. I found out later that the Ranger Teeo had also decided to pull a few at the same time I had, and this lead to the overwhelming force. we all got drug to the entrance of dulak from gunthak, and Akcron was escorted to the bodies to resurrect. We then continued fighting, without our Ranger for he had to leave. After several hours of attempting to get my medallion from the dock hands, I decided it was best to leave and head for other tasks.  I decided it was now the time to act against the nefarious Sir Lucan De'lere, Militia Leader of Freeport. He was turned away from the Truthbringer and had to be brought to justice. I summoned my greatest allies to my side, with exception of Ellektra and Akcron, for Ellektra was still sleeping, and Akcron promised another that she would assist him in the dungeons of Norrath. I called forth Feral Lord Deltree Sikholen, Konath Khaostar, Kretais, Vyoletta, and Shahlya to assist in this epic battle. Some were nervous that they would be hated by Freeport's militia forever, but I told them if they escaped to the commonlands in time, the guards would not notice their transgressions.  We arrived in Freeport, and lined up near the passage to escape, we discussed the plan, and I put it forth, running into the militia hour, glaring menacingly at the foul Lucan, and I hit him with the Holy Might of Brell. As the holy blast erupted his flesh and stunned his mind, I ran, he gave chase as soon as he could, but by then, the spirit of wolf had carried me to the common lands.  My allies then came up to lucan, who suprising to all of us, was all alone, Brother Jentry obviously quaking in his boots at the sight of a Holy Paladin of Brell. I returned from the commonlands, and began to strike the defenseless Lucan, pulling him closer and closer to the escape route before laying into him with everything brell has blessed me with. As lucan began to look deathly, I urged my allies to flee, while me and Shahlya continued to smash Lucan with our holy might. he fell, and in his place a Lich appeared! truly this man is the foulest of beings for he was truly dead inside. I summoned forth the holy power of Nife, imbuing my blade with retributive power against undead, and slayed him easily. No more would Lucan reign over the people of Freeport. I took his testimony that I would later need to give to the Truthbringers, in exchange for the Brilliant Sword of Faith.  I thanked my allies, unfortunately Kretais did not escape the yard of Freeport in time, and is also hated by Freeport now. I apologized to him, and Kretais, Konath and I went to West Karana to slay bandits. The bandits were hated by the priests of life, and I knew that I would have to prove myself to brother hayle before he would relinquish the firey sword Soulfire to me. I slayed well over a hundred bandits and retrieved fifty of their sashes, which I turned into Chesgard inside Qeynos, he then thought highly of me, and so the next day I summoned forth my allies Akcron, Kretais, and Konath, and along the way, Allies I haven't seen in ages joined my crew, Arymist the Wizard, and Katheena the Paladin. I thanked them for coming, and we all went into Infected paw, into their dungeons, where I spoke to brother hayle. he thought warmly of me, and handed me my soulfire once I had given him my testimony, the glowing sword hilt, the brilliant sword of faith, and a note I received from him months before. I took it into my hands and my allies did cheer! I was proud that I had earned such a powerful weapon, a true symbol of divine force. I conscribed a Bard to sketch a portrait of me and my allies, once he finishes the color work on it, I shall place it in my journal here, to help me remember my friends who helped me on this quest.  The rest of the night after I received soulfire I spent in Dulak, killing the armor smiths of the dastardly pirates. Soon I grew weary, and Arymist cast his portal spell to drag us across time and space to the Plane of Knowledge. Ah, I was home again, and there I rested for the night. With my final Prayer to Brell I spoke:  Praise be to Vyoletta! A fine cleric who aided me in killing Sir Lucan Praise be to Deltree! his fierce blows did strike fear in Lucan Praise be to Shahlya! a fellow Paladin who helped bring Lucan to Justice Praise be to Kretais! my dearest friend, always there when I need him Praise be to Konath! his mighty strength helped fell the Mighty Lucan Praise be to Arymist! who's Portals saved us in travel, and who's spells destroy evil Praise be to Katheena! Whose strength assisted me and reaching Brother Hayle Praise be to Akcron! the Gnomish Cleric, and Love of my life  If ever shall we meet, may it be as brothers, and not as enemies Ziggur Rathebringer
