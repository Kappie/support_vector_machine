There has been several court successful challenges recently that declare a ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional, and the  urlLink City of San Francisco  is granting marriage licenses to same-sex couples.  The United States should do what Canada has done. The Government of Canada fought this issue for years, up to the Supreme Court. But then suddenly is realized it was a battle not worth fighting, withdrew its challenge at the Supreme Court, and announced it would change the law -- legalizing same-sex marriage.  There are SO MANY problems in the world, and problems in the United States even. Wars are being fought, skilled people can't find work, there are thousands poor and homeless, jails are too full to hold all the criminals, and there have been many heinous crimes that have not been solved.... why do politicians and conservative groups waste all that precious time and energy fighting against equal rights for homosexuals? Why do congressmen hold hearings on the Janet Jackson SuperBreast? Why do they hold hearings investigating Martha Stewart?  Sometimes I wonder about people's priorities. Instead of making a list of the top 20 most important issues, and working hard on each of them, they let the important issues get progressively worse and focus in on such little, inconsequential stuff.
