What if I won lotto? and what if I hadnt done xyz? Tonight I watched again, a movie that I've loved since seeing it the first time, The Time Machine, staring Guy Pearce.. Basically a late 1800 to early 1900's professor builds a time machine to go back and try and rewrite the events that lead to his fiancee's demise.. This wasn't of so much interest, but the movie as a whole does tackle a few interesting ethical questions, and does follow reasonably closely to a lot of the 'ideas' I have about how life, and time and all those big questions actually 'are'. I say ideas, because that is what I have - lots of people say beliefs.. but beliefs are unchanging, set in stone.. what I have are a collection of what I think are the best ideas that I've heard or thought of, at any given time. These ideas raised in the movie are about the cyclical nature of 'life' that inhabbits this planet that we call home. During the vast travel into the future, we get a great computer generated glimpse at what a hugely accellerated time-lapse film of the world coming to an 'end' so far as civillisation is concerned, before all life is wiped out, or most of, then an ice age, then the birth of a new landscape.. slowly populated by more and more diverse species.. coming to where he stops his journey, and the movie continues. In a nutshell he encounters a variety of human that have devided into castes or sectors of people that are specifcally evolved for the tasks they're required to perform.. strong agile ones for carrying out the hunting through to skinny goth looking ones that talk with an uncanny jeremy irons voice, but are exceptionally brilliant and able to control the minds of the lesser mentally developed creatures.  This movie reminds me that everything is cyclical.. everything.. on a karma level, in that we get back what we give, and also on a global and universal level. I dont think we can alter what is supposed to happen, I believe in the existence of some sort of pre-determined course of events or 'fate', and I believe that everything is worthwhile. Except maybe NZ Idol and reality TV - but I'm getting off the track... There is a quote, toward the end of the movie, that I'd like to stuff up, and get out of context, in an effort to share it with you all, inform those that havent heard it yet, and remind those that have.  "We all have our time machines. ... travelling back in our memories.. and forward in our dreams"  What more do we really need?  Keep dreaming, Keep smiling.. oh and PS. Friends that go to Bali and come back stressing about how their 'tan is fading' are poopoo heads. Yeah you heard me! *pokes tongue out* My feet are cold. G'night.
