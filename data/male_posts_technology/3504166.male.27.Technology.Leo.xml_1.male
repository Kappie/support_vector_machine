She's like... arts :)  Well it's also odd because it's the first damn girl that I've met in such a long time who is actually interesting to talk to.  I've been wandering around in a daze, like I was 16 again, with this damn fool grin on my face..   Churning through the SMSes and phone time like there's no tomorrow, and even did the old "no you hang up first" thing last night - albeit partly a joke..   Well it's fun anyway.  ...and in work news.  Offered a permenant PM role at GE.  As long as they can come to the party with 100k+ I will probably take it, because you know what they say about a bird in the hand being better than 2 larking around in the freaking trees.  Problem is it's working for PG - who is .. well.. how do you say, a snake-eyes extrordinaire.  Second problem is that it's working for Ops, which I guess is not where I wanted to go.  Advantages?   Well it's a PM role.   I can get my black-belt certification and then transition out of financial services into... aerospace engineering or something.   ...and in other news - my hairdresser just rang to tell me that they've entered me in a hairdressing competition next month. How cool.   I am looking forward to my new life as a man-wh0re. w00t!  ;)
