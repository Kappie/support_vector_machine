How about a war on ignorance?  My issue with these types of "wars" is that the focus is ALWAYS on government solving societal ills rather than people.  I'm tired of everyone telling me what I should or should not do.  I'm not a child and I know what's best for me and my family...the government does not.  I have a vested interest in my behavior, government could care less about me personally.
