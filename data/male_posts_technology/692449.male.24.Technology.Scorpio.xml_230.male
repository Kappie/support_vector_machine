My one year anniversary with susan is coming up which I still need to plan for. My friend Erica is having a hard time out in California and I'm trying to think of a way to help her. I haven't been hanging out with my friends much for two reasons one because I have been working a whole bunch and two I have been on a sort of intellectual kick lately and my friends haven't been so it's kind of harder to have conversations when I want to talk about poltics and philosphy and my friends don't.
