That being said why in holy fuck are we sending civilian contractors to work in a   war zone   and then acting shock when the get kill or are used as bargaining chips.  Now it would be a huge surprise if these people were being taken from their warm comfortable beds in the middle of the night, but they're no, they are willingly traveling to an active war zone (yes assholes it is still a war) in the pursuit of monetary gain.  I'm not some bleeding heart, captialist-hating commie, but I would not put my lilly white ass on the line just for some extra cash.  We need to start treating the Iraq War like a motherfucking war and not some after-school special where we all get a warm and fuzzy feeling after learning that the tin secratary of defense always had a heart and the mentally-challenge president realizes that it's okay to ride the short bus.
