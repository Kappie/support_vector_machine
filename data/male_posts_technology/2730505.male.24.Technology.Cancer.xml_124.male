Yeah, not really up and down basketball that you see.  So tonight we played at this little school/church thing right of Butterfield Rd.  It was like an elementary school gym with bent buckets and shit.  It was fun.  Met some cool guys.  They really weren't that good but good enough.  Jerry dominated most of the games since he was probably the tallest and biggest dyude there.  I wasn't able to play offesively but was holding it down a little with the defense.  We played 7 games or so.  I was dead tired and wasn't hitting any shots till the sixth game or something.  I would miss wide open shots bank shots, jumpers, and even layups.  It was ugly.  It was like that till I fucking made a damn layup.  I woke up there and was able to play accordingly.  I finally made my presence felt in the last game when everyone was tired.  Well considering I am a smoker, I was tired too but I just had enough to be able to contribute.    Yeah, I really really really have to quit smoking.  My energy level is fine during the games but the stamina just isn't there.  I feel so awake.  This is great!  We got more games next Monday and I intend on doing a better job that this pathetic display of basketball shittiness.  Two more days and I am no a mini vacation.  Hell YEAH!
