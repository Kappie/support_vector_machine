It's gorgeous -- hats off to the UI design team. In fact, even Word and Excel 2003 have really, really cool UI. Microsoft is starting to add some real color to their UI. Gone is the grey and blue. Now if only they could update IE with the same look and feel.  I've seen Apple iTunes, and was not impressed.  The latest version of Office is definitely the coolest looking application I have ever seen.     Or maybe I'm easily impressed. But from what I've read out in the blogosphere, I'm not alone in liking this new release.
