Should't have to have that emotion in your life period)  My left leg has just been hurting horribly the last few days.  For the last three weeks its ached and hurt in general. Its been between about 5inches down from my hip, to a few inches above my knee.  It doesnt feel like the muscle, feels like it hurts in the bone.  I haven't hit it against anything, falling, lifted anything too heavy.. it just hurts.  And when it really starts to hurt it gets there.    It made me think of the chart they gave my wife Z*lda when she had some outpatient surgery a few months ago. They rate pain based on a zero to 10 scale, 10 being the worst.  Last night I would have rated the pain around a 6-7.  It was enough I was almost crying from it.  I know I know... I must not be a real man..but it really hurt!  I've tried several different pain killers, and even gave Naproxin a shot (known over the counter as Aleve).  Well...it didn't Aleve anything. I took some about 11:45, and it's not stopped hurting one bit in the last 5hrs.  Living with pain just sucks in general.
