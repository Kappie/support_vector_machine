It's just not an easy field to break into, so I feel like I'm paddling upstream sometimes.  But I keep going, 'cause I don't have any choice but to do so.  To give up would not be in keeping with my character.  I may be frustrated and cry and scream and get angry and think the world unjust, but I collect myself and keep trying, 'cause that's me. :)  I'll be fine, trust me.  I was just having a college student moment of self-doubt-induced panic. :)
