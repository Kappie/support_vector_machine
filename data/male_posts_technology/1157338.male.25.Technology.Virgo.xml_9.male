I have done more work this last month than a man should in three.  I also have some important announcements regarding me:  1) I am now local ACM president at OSU, so bow down. 2) I got hired for a contract to work on a game that I've been looking forward to for a couple of years now (more on that in a bit) 3) all our puppies have been given good homes, and 4) I am still unemployed.  OK, now onto the more exciting bits of that - the game dev thing especially.  Back when I was a kid, my dad bought our first computer. It was a 286. It was wonderful.  We went through more than a few upgrades over the next few years, so I can't remember which iteration of hardware we were on when I started playing the game that changed my young little life. The Bard's Tale.  My goodness I loved that game. Played it for hours on end. Beat it and thought I was the biggest badass around.  It was first person oriented Computer RPG, similar to the wizardry series (but a bit more interesting in my opinion).  Anyways, I loved this game dearly. Fast Forward to 2 years ago - I find that there is a group of indy developers working a game that is "loosely based" on Bard's Tale. I was ecstatic, I went and checked out the website and all that rot.  It looked grand and totally took me back to being an 11 year-old in front of dad's PC.  So I joined up on the mailing list.  Well, I go back every few months, and the game does seem to advance (albeit slowly, these guys are all doing this in their spare time).  The game goes through some major revisions and all that.  Lately, it's started too look like it's getting close to being finished, and I toss off the random email offering my services to help test or even do some extra dev work they got layin around, as I want to get the ball moving so I can play this darn game.  They were cool about it and said they'd offer me some testing stuff.  A few weeks later lo and behold, I get an email saying, hey, we ran into a snag with one of our developers, you care to jump in and get some stuff doen for us?  Of course I jump on it, they said there were a few others who were interested, and they'd have to check into all of us, but in the end i got picked. So yippie yay me!  I'm rocking the hisouse now, and I'll even get a share of the profits from teh game, so hey, even better!  anyways, the game  has a website at: http://www.devilwhiskey.com go check it out if you like.  I'm tired now, it's a bit late. I'll start posting a little more regularly, promise (things are certainly still busy in the gradschool front, but hey, it'll be better soon).  Phil.
