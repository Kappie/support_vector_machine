As I said  "Where land has been taken unlawfully, it must be given back."   And the main point I believe is as follows:-  "Let me also remind you that this document is beginning to be viewed as a legal document. But how can it be? If the English version significantly differs to the Maori version, then the Treaty surely is invalid, since neither side can be reasonably expected to know what the other sides version of the document says. And therefore are signing different agreements! If it is invalid, then it must be done away with entirely. "
