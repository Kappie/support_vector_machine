Anyway, I hope to get this site re-started, especially now that no one really talks on Asian Avenue or Friendster now.  Leave your thoughts on anything you've done lately, anything you've seen, personal opinions, anything: I'm gonna try and do it at least three times a week from now on, and I figure y'all will jump in.  If not, whatever: I'll think of this as my personal online diary.  It'll be the blue screen to my Doogie Howser.
