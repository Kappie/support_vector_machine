 I have a friend who develops software for schools and Apple has pretty much shoved OS X down their throats, but they are reluctant to create all new software for OS X because a lot of schools are moving to PCs. On a positive note for Apple fans, at least Steve Job's ego isn't preventing them from keeping OS 9 around a little longer, although OS 9 users are only prolonging the inevitable.
