Well before I explain why I haven't been updating my where about on this assignment I'd like to say that it was me who made the decision to take on this project. There was only one other person who I consulted for support (thank you sweetie) but ultimately as a husband, father  man it was my decision to take this contract and so far I have no regrets. Whatever ultimately happens good or bad nobody should feel responsible or remorseful for this decision. The reason why I say this is there has been some people who have been critical and negative to me and my decision for coming to this area of the world and have given me grief for being here. I only want to say to those people if you can't support my decision then please just leave me alone and don't contact me. I have chosen to take this risky assignment and it's me here risking my safety for this opportunity and the last thing I need to hear is about your objections to my decision. At this point in time I only want to hear from people who are going to be positive and support me and my decisions. If you want to give me a hard time, do it when I come home.  OK, with that off my chest I like to tell everyone that I'm fine and comfortable in the ancient city of Babylon, Iraq. I arrived here about two weeks ago and I'm truly in awe that I get to eat, sleep and live in the oldest city in the world. The base that I was assigned literally encircles the ruins of the old city (which is still there although parts of it are a replica) and my trailer (my home while I'm here) probably rests on some ancient building or artifact. But before I go into my life here let me tell you about and explain my trip that got me here, which is just as interesting.
