Rather reminiscent of the Dems in the States so recently. My money's on Nahas Angula. In the end, what'll matter is being able to swing votes from the rather simplistic majority. At the very least he's promoting 'Unity', 'Fairness' and 'Progress', although those words have thus far meant very little coming from the current administration. So far all we Namibians have witnessed is continued below-the-surface segregation, race-based discrimination in the form of rigid affirmitave-action policies, and progress solely in the size of the government car fleet and our President's magnificent 250-million Namibian Dollar retirement mansion. At least we now have the  hope  of positive change. At least Nujoma refrained from altering the Constitution to allow for another term. It's funny. He was hailed as a hero for simply adhering to the current Constition. I think fears of him pulling a Mugabe were pretty rampant, and the relief expressed by so many when he chose to embrace common sense was metamorphosed into hero-worship to appease him lest he change his mind.  And just when a glimmer of hope shines...   "THE head of Namibia's Government-owned bi-weekly New Era newspaper has scoffed at suggestions that a planned regional publication by his organisation and Zimbabwean state run media will be a propaganda tool to counter "anti-Zimbabwe stories". New Era Managing Director, Protasius Ndauendapo, told The Namibian yesterday that the idea of a new newspaper was conceived from "purely business principles". "People should not think that there is a political agenda. We were not pushed by any politician to embark on the project... this is a purely business venture," maintained Ndauendapo."    urlLink Ha. Right.
