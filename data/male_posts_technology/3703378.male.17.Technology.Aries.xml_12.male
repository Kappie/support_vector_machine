I'm almost certainly sure that this car is for me...cause my mom....c'mon..! She drives an Oldmobile! and besides..I need a car anyway...I thought I was going to get the Honda...but I guess I'll be ricing out this Mitsubishi with a bombing sound system, body kits, and other stuff! I can't wait to tell my sensei in cars, Chris...wonder if he'll think its cool or not...I still don't know much about cars....so I need to see what I can do to it and if it is fast or not....Ohh well...we shall see when I get back home and start organizing my room! I have to unscrew all that crap on my futon, then rebuild it in the backroom...and another thing! I need to go buy my very own fish, like tetras and stuff...I want colorful fish...and all we have in that 20 gal tank are guppies and such...BORING....welp..Im off to the Tech Center! Wish me luck!
