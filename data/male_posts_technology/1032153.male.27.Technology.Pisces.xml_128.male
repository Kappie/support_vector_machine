Why is it that the public finds mediocrity (in this case the people on NZ Idol) more interesting than brilliance. Now some may say I am biased, and that those in NZ Idol are brilliant. I find it hard to compare this 'brilliance' with brilliance that is trained to the milli-second, the kind of brilliance that takes 6 hours a day for years. Why is it that people will hear  Chopin's "Minute Waltz" and apathetically say 'oh yeah', or even worse 'boring'; but they will hear Robin (who's tuning is lacking at best) on New Zealand Idol, and go wild? Is there more to the modern music scene than music? It seems so. Now to qualify this. I am a fan of some modern music, and listen often to contemporary Christian music, although in complete honesty I find that my mind and emotions are far more stimulated by classical music, particularly by Beethoven and Brahms. I challenge you if you have not really tried before to start listening to classical music. It takes an effort at first. Perhaps that is why it isn't popular. But the effort you spend listening to it eventually becomes less and less, and you open up to yourself a whole new world of possibilities which can provide many hours of stimulation, soothing... or riling up if you choose the right pieces!
