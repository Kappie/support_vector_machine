May 24, 2004  Last week's Monday Night RAW was a memorable one for Kane. The Big Red Monster defeated Val Venis in singles competition, won a Battle Royal to become the No. 1 Contender for the World Heavyweight Championship at Bad Blood and received an answer of "yes" from Lita to a question he posed several weeks ago. With Kane in top form after last week's success, what is next for him as he prepares for his match at Bad Blood? Also, will his question to Lita be revealed? Find out on RAW.     Speaking of the Battle Royal, Kane's victory was a result of the suspended Shawn Michaels gaining a measure of payback from Triple H. When the final two were Triple H and Kane, HBK appeared out of nowhere to eliminate The Game and give Kane a trip to Bad Blood. The Game was enraged as RAW came to an end, and it is expected that he will be in a bad way this coming week on RAW. What will his reaction be? Find out on RAW.  Triple H wasn't the only member of Evolution to have a bad night last Monday.  Will Ric Flair's luck turn around this week when he faces Edge one-on-one?  Find out on RAW.  And the question on everybody's mind is what's in store for Eugene after taking down Garrison Cade and Jonathan Coachman last week with a little help from his good friend, The Rock.  Find out on RAW this Monday as Eugene and William Regal face off against Garrison Cade and Jonathan Coachman.  All of this and more as the road to Bad Blood continues on Monday Night RAW at 9/8 PM CT on Spike TV.
