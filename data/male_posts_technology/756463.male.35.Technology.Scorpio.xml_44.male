Ladies and gentlemen, the day your briefcase is too heavy is the day you need to head back into the gym or at least do some pushups.    I'll get you started.  Order the book "Combat Conditioning" from this guy:   urlLink Matt Furey .  For those of you who want to get REALLY fit, and I'm not just talking lifting weights and getting big, cosmetic muscles, but actually STRONGER, buy this guy's stuff.  And follow his program.  I'm doing it and I've never felt better.
