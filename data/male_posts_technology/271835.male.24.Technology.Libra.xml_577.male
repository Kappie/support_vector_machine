They have a set of cartoons (scanned from the likes of Readers Digest) which they have separated the text and graphics and then recombined in a random stylee. Surprisingly it can come up with some very funny cartoons.     EDIT:  Some of the cartoons may not be SFW. Obviously Penthouse c was a source for the cartoons too!
