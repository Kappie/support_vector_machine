A story posted a week or so ago in which I used the restroom in a wooded area may have been misrepresented.  I was NOT in someone's front yard as some may think or wonder.  I was in some protected wooded area which may not make my crimes any better. 2.  After my most recent update of a "pukey feeling" run, Heather (the "Mayberry" sister) got the impression that I was blaming her cooking for me feeling pukey.  This was not the case at all.  I felt pukey because I ate a wonderfully cooked dinner prepared by Mayberry then tried to run (never a good combination).  Enough of the notes, on with the obsessively long updates.  Update for 7/29/04  "That Guy" run I have realized that in running, I have become "That Guy."  I am that guy running in zero degree weather that everybody honks at to get back inside.  I am that guy who is running in 90+ degree heat indexes with tunes jamming away while sweat pours down every inch of me.  I am that guy who is running down your street between the hours of 5:30 and 6:30a.m.  I am also the guy who is running down your street at 11:00p.m. (as was the case this night).  I got home a little later than expected but had to run so I set out at 10:45p.m. for a quick 4-miler.  Even though I had already eaten dinner, unlike Wednesday, I left enough time for it to digest.  This made a huge difference as I felt great this night and could have run much longer except for getting tired near the end.  I continue to learn on my runs and Thursday I learned that a cemetary is the spookiest thing by which to run at 11 at night.  It was downright desolate while I was running and the spooky, dark bushes outside the cemetary on Victory Parkway didn't help matters any.  I expected the cast of the Thriller video to come crawling out and perform a synchronized dance routine but no luck.  I sped past the cemetary, up to Xavier, east on Dana, and then down Woodburn to home.  I got incredibly tired coming down Woodburn due to the time of night and the fact I should have been in bed.  I was still able to make it home in reasonable time and covered just over 4 miles.    Update for 7/31/04  Sweltering 6 I'm not sure why I decided to set out in the hottest part of Saturday but I did because I had to get my miles in for the week.  I did get a chance to try out my new iPod armband with much success meaning I won't have to carry the stupid thing anymore.  The heat is the main thing to report about Saturday.  It was downright sweltering and the sweat that came out of unknown pores on my body proved it.  My body was still a little tired and confused about the amount of sleep I got (>11 hours) but I dragged myself along for 6 miles.  I went right down MLK to the fraternity house mainly because I knew that there and back, the frat house is 6 miles away.  This helped me to not focus on time so much as the distance.  This run was riddled with stops for walking.  I stopped at the halfway point to walk for a minute.  After the treachery of the University Hospital hills, I stopped for another 1:30 and then with a mile left to go, I stopped for 2:00.  I'm not sure why I stopped so much but I really wasn't in any mood to push my body super hard on a long run day.  Even though I had my iPod with me, it would have helped to have some water with me as well.  My 8 mile run to the CE was great because there was water along the way and at the halfway point.  This run was just an urban jungle or more like an urban desert.  I drank close to a gallon of water upon returning.  I ran way too fast as well which could have led to excessive tiring.  I completed 6 miles (with walking stops) in 50 minutes.  This may sound good, but not the kind of times I shoot for on my long runs.  Oh well, there is always next week.    I had planned on 3 miles Sunday but just didn't do it.  I maintained most of my miles last week and don't feel bad about missing 3 miles.  I'm still hearing reports that my partner in crime, Bradley Ryan Zappin, has horrendous shin splints and might try to get out of this marathon.  Keep him in your prayers if you remember and pray that he is okay by marathon time (or long before so he can get his miles in) because I will drag him the 26.2 miles if I have to.  Enough for today and this past weekend.  Thanks for tuning in!  Have a great week! TW
