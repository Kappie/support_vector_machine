I like: - pre trip meetings are mandatory - the idea of some progression to their trips - the integration of college age students too for the upper experience trips It's pretty cool. I don't see any reason why we couldn't do something like this at GCC.  In fact, I think this summer will be a great start.  If I could only get that one special leader...
