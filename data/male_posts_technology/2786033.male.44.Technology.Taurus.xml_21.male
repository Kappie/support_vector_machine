I violated some key rule of carpentry today, and I'm too ignorant to know which one.    Back to the books for me, and perhaps a weekend apprenticeship.   And now a tidy little segue:   I have certainly offended our local  urlLink doomsday cult  today.  Not only did I benefit from tree murder,  I also used  urlLink un-natural substances  to prevent my dead treeflesh from going back to mother earth.  (I'm serious! those asshelmets actually talk like that!)  I have to say that our local  urlLink doomsday cult    have not as yet actually murdered anybody.  They have so far been happy just ruining careers.  (But only of chainsaw weilding tree-murderers.)
