Of course he knows that it is impossible to alter the bone structure etc., but he feels he can be white. a la Michael Jackson. From the brown Indian to the white American, or rather the White Indian. In fact he is so obsessed that, he has already spent a fortune on it. The result, well that is the sad part.  In the mean time, he started learning guitar. Self learning, mind you. After two years, he is now a guitar player. A good one at that. He has really learnt the ropes, or rather strings in this case. He once made me listen to  Californication  by  Red Hot Chilli Peppers . Really good, I even exclaimed that this seems to be an unplugged version etc. Then I realized that it was recorded by him. Vocals, Lead, Base and Rhythm, all credit goes to the  great white hope .  All said and done, he is one of the most brilliant people I have met on this planet. (I will tell you about my inter-planetary sojourns later).
