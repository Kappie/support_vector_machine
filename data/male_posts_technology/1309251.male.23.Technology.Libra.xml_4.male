On Monday ,morning,I was feeling cold in my palm.I was just dabbling at the idea of going to work.My brother-in-law,had an early flight to catch at 7.00AM(I live with my sister and brother-in-law for the last 8 months after my employment).I just figured out ,that,it would be a terrible mistake to just go to my work place a rough 28KM from home.I nodded my head over everything my brother-in-law gave as instructions.The help maid was the first person to know that ,I was ill.By the time she cleaned the place and the utensils,my brother-in-law called.I told him to call my parents at Chennai(capital of a state in India called Tamil Nadu). I just made sure atleast an emotional support could be possible.I called up my office  to tell them ,I could not come.Still the manager was insisting that ,I come and explain everything to the backup engineer(I am an outsourced network administator).  The whole of Monday passed with the fever.The very next at 10.00Am ,my brother-in-law's office mate helped me with all the doctor and stuff.He even got me into their company's guest house. I was on a viscous rice solution for 2 and half days.The guy at the guest house was even bored seeing me eat the same thing everyday.I just told him that I will be leaving the guesthouse on Friday,before that I had a good north-Indian meal minus the oil.  I felt weak when I reached my home.I had bread and jam for breakfast,slept for a while and started cooking for my lunch.I sure was tired and my legs couldn't keepup with the pace .I called up my manager and told him that I will get to the office on Monday.He asked me to come on saturday.Just imagine how merciless and less human when normal workers become managers.They could just make things easier for everybody,but,no they  just want their work done.I told him that ,I was tired and weak to even go for field calls.  Even when your are not doing anything it is fun to just lie down in the sofa and sleep all day.
