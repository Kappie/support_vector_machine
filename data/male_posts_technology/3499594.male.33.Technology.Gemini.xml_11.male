She then took the 4 kids ( were watching 2 of them during the day ((nearly 6:30 p.m. and they are still here)) for the next couple of weeks). She calls me asking for a forgotten check here,from another mom. I said I would just take it there ( Basketball camp ). Well, after I spent 20 minutes trying to find the keys, I call her back. But she has my cell phone, and I cant remember my cell phone number.   No I don't call myself very often. I finally find the number in my PDA. I call her and guess what, yep, she has both sets of keys.   So she comes back home. During the time, I keep calling her cell phone to hear it ring. You would never guess where I found it, in the trunk of the car. Don't ask.  So she gets back, gets the check, cell phone, ect. and heads back to camp. I get back to work. I already had an 8 oclock conference call that lasted for an hour. I am on support this week, so that means any issues coming up during the day comes to me. Fortunately that  part was quite. I find out, I made a change to an interface, in production ie immediate effect, last night and my correction did not take place. Thus the on-call person got called at 1 a.m. and she wasnt happy, who happens to be my supervisor.   Its just 9:10 a.m.   It spirals from there. I worked on a interface testing it to go live in less than 2 weeks. Total frustration, in which I won't go into details. Let it just be known it sucks ok. I can't make the changes I need to because some Nimrod put the same transactions I need to change in live. So any changes I make will effect what is currently being used. Hence last nights episode.   I did manage to get out by 5 p.m., just one hour after I should be able to. I then vacuumed and put away clothes. My wife, bless her heart, made a great dinner. We had a big baked potatoe, steak smothered with mushrooms and vegetables.   I know her day was no better. She had to deal with the 4 kids, all day running to and fro. It's now 6:30 p.m. and I don't foresee the parents till a little after 7 p.m. So the evening is pretty much shot.   The rain finally quite and the sun is out, going down now. The grass is drenched and looks like it grew 3 inches today alone.
