I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day You got me in a spin but everythin' is A.OK!  Touching you, touching me touching you, god you're touching me  I believe in a thing called love Just listen to the rhythm of my heart There's a chance we could make it now We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down I believe in a thing called love Ooh! Guitar!  Touching you, touching me touching you, god you're touching me  I believe in a thing called love Just listen to the rhythm of my heart There's a chance we could make it now We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down I believe in a thing called love Ooh!  "I believe in a thing called love" - The Darkness  That band is fscking sweet. That song reminds me of Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes. Solid Snake falls in love, so I think...he seems to have a thing for meryl...Although he only subliminally shows it. He hasn't said that he actually is in love with her, but i can see it. When she got shot in both knees and her elbow and was lying on the ground bleeding, he was like "GODDAMNIT!!" and he was beating the wall. 'Cause he couldnt go save her, because he would have gotten shot in the head by Sniper Wolf. That chick is one hell of a sniper. Seriously. If  I  wasn't such a kick-ass sniper, then she would have pwnzed me. But i'm better. Ibelieveinathingcalledlove, JUSTlistentotherhythmofmyhearrrt.
