You are  not  that important that someone want to read about how you cut yourself.  In fact, others are laughing at you behind their computer screens.    Ah well.  As long as I never meet one of these freaks.  I may explode into a violent fury and give them to really whine about.    Of course, I really can't say much.  I'm about to lay some stuff down myself.  I've been listening to a lot of Celtic influenced music lately.  Why I don't know.  Must be because I can't find anything else that sounds decent.    A new little thing I'm going to start doing.  Recommended reads.  Books and comics that I thing other may like and why they may.  Today's is  V for Vendetta , a comic written by Alan Moore and drawn by David Lloyd.  A very interesting comic set in a facsist England where a "hero" named V begins to cause trouble.  To say much more would be to ruin the story.  You can pick this up at most comic shops as a trade paperback.  Do so.  NOW!   Oh, the Rolling Stones still suck.  Just thought I would throw that out there.
