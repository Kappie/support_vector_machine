And, yes, harmony, we are going to engage a part of the world with the Screaming Eagles. Sometimes, people will only stop and listen when you hit them over the head with a very big stick.... I have to say that the military has become a very effective instrument of exporting the good parts of America. See Dana Priest's new book: 'The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace With America's Military' for more information (and very engaging reading) about how the US military has successfully stepped in and delivered peace and security in places like Kosovo when institutions like the UN have failed utterly.  Can you tell how I've been spending my free time?  Another interview at 1:00 today -- keep your fingers crossed.....
