The movie argues that he is a very intelligent man, focused on power over morals and is guilty of war crimes.  I found nothing contradicting my previous knowledge of these subjects. That being said, Vietnam is the only one that I have studied extensively (something I plan to blog on later). My knowledge of East Timor mostly comes from the news and the movie  urlLink Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media  that I saw at the end of last year. Regarding Chile, what little recent knowledge I have comes from the news around the time of the whole Pinochet-trial thing. Since I was little I've known that the socialist Allende was overthrown by Pinochet, but I don't know when I became aware of the American involvement, whether it was a youngster or in my later teens.  The narration is very well done by  urlLink Brian Cox  and helps the flow of the film which is very good to begin with. It's much better than in  urlLink The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara  that I saw about five weeks ago.  This is much more of a documentary than Fahrenheit 9/11 (see  urlLink previous post ). Then again, there is a whole lot more information to go on, especially regarding de-classified documents and such.  This is definitely a keeper. The only reason I'm giving this a 4.5 instead of a 5 is that I feel that it could have been a little more even-handed - I would have liked to see more people defending Kissinger. I just hope I won't suffer the same fate as I did with Michael Moore's  urlLink Bowling for Columbine  - I was very disappointed when I found out about it's use of  urlLink fictitious "facts" . -->
