Printed the artwork, pasted it onto a frame and mounting board for submission, got the write-up finalised and printed out. Even went for an early lunch to get ready to submit it later in the afternoon after my P1 class.  Things went OK for awhile. That is until another class wanted to use the lab slot after mine. I was a bit confused (naturally since I was still in the middle of my class). Florence wanted to bring her class in later as well because it was her class slot. BUt I knew there was another CCA club that will be in the lab later. Got even more confused and after my class ended I tried to sort the whole thing out. I had gotten the class schedule out last week and submitted to my HoD then. After awhile, I realised it was Daphne (again) who didn't update her class exceptions which fell out of the usual slot. Basically it caused a lot of 'eating into' other class slots thereby affecting a few more classes here and there. Not a big problem that can't be solved, but I'm very tired of updating lab slots all the time when such a thing happens. I had to apologise to Florence (can tell that her class was quite disappointed), told Daphne to settle the future exceptions herself. Aiya, natural lah, not like I'm the one in charge of scheduling the classes anyway. I only update the softcopy for my HoD that's all.  After that, I had to pia down to submit the artwork for the competition. Got to Bedok View Sec (located next to Siglap CC where I train every Thurs evenings), and guess what ... found out I've gone to the WRONG SCHOOL.... pengz. Alamak! Didn't panick lah, just felt sian coz the weather was very hot and I was starting to perspire like a pig. Sianz man. I SMSed my HoD and asked if I could claim cab fare if I rushed down. She SMSed back saying it was fine if I had the receipt. As I was entering CHIJ Katong Pri, I got a call from David (final yr UK housemate) that they were having dinner. So random but a welcomed invitation all the same. Told him I was more than up for it. He even suggested asking my ex along. SMSed her but I might have left her updated HP no in my home PC because my SMS didn't seem to get thru.  Anyway, I got back to school, called up Bt View Sec (the correct one!) and asked what time they closed. The guy on the other end was really nice (a gentleman by the name of Mr Peng). He didn't think it was wise of me to rush down anyway so he said he'll let the teacher in charge (Mr Wai) know that I'll be submitting tommorrow instead.  When I think about it, since last month, I got no idea why I always had the impression that I was to submit the artwork to Bedok View Sec. I must've taken it for granted and not double checked it. Haiz ... stupid stupid.  Ultimately, carelessness on my part ended nicely today. Felt really glad that things worked out just fine.
