Customer: "Oh, more recent? Here's one in June." Me: "Ok, so the one in June is the latest?" Customer: "No, the one in May is." Me: "Sir...June comes after May" Customer: "Right, but you said the latest." Me: "...is June the latest, AKA most recent date available, or not?"  Three minutes of my life that I will never get back. There are two possibilities here: A) He doesn't comprehend that May is the month prior to June; B) He doesn't comprehend that in this context, the word "latest" is synonymous with "most recent". I almost have to dismiss A as a possibility right away because the man was able to dial his telephone, so he can't possibly be that stupid. This leaves us with B, but this isn't much better. I've never heard of anyone, anywhere, who thinks "the latest date" somehow means "the least recent". My mind is thoroughly boggled.
