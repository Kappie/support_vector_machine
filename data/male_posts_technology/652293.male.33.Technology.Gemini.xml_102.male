I just wanted to try it out because it was  urlLink developed  with a Mac.  I am still interested in seeing what  urlLink BloggerPro  has to offer (if it comes back online), and  urlLink TypePad  (whenever it becomes available).  I know  urlLink Phark  is using Typepad.  Now I have a friend who is thinking of devloping some blog-like software, though much more to it.  Yes, even than what is currently available or planned, so there.  And it may or may not become a  urlLink parabolic weenie roaster .
