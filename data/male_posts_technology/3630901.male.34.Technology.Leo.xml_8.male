Some people think I didn't wait long enough, but how long am I supposed to wait?  Did she simply blow me off, or was she just running late?  I'll never know, I guess.  I left her a message at home and sent her an email - no response.  Things seemed so good via email.  Maybe I shouldn't have talked religion on our first phone conversation.    After leaving the restaurant I had gone home, and I guess L and the kids and just gotten home.  The kids were excited to see me but I was feeling very irritated (I don't know why).  L was upset that I wasn't more patient with them.  I changed into shorts and went out, not sure where to go, but feeling in the pits.  I thought about going to the beach in Milford or calling a friend or just going for a bite to eat by myself, but it all felt so depressing.  I was feeling a little suicidal.  I went to Dean's house and just dropped in.  I felt a little bad doing that, but I was really down, so I needed to see someone.  He did his best to make me feel better.  Then he said let's update your profile and update your pictures on the dating service.  So we did that -- he made it more fun, I guess.    Eventually he got tired of living the life a single guy through me and he kicked me out.  I went home, even though I should have probably wandered around or gone for a bite to eat or done something.  I don't know what.  I went home and L said, oh good your home - do you mind if I go out for a drink?  Whatever.  I just wanted to take an ambien and end the night.  I actually opened the bottle and fantasized about taking the whole bottle.  But I'm responsible now and I shouldn't have such thoughts.  Sunday we had a late breakfast with L's folks at Cracker Barrel.  It was good - I like that place, even though it doesn't lend itself to helping me with my attempts and vegetarianism.  I had poached eggs, fried catfish, buttermilk biscuits with honey, and ice water.  After breakfast I couldn't resist getting some chocolate covered malted milk balls.  Then L took the kids to the zoo, and I presumably went to look at houses.  I drove by some but then got a little bummed out and drove home.  I played computer games until around 1:30 and then decided maybe I should do some yardwork.  Just as I was getting started, L came home with the kids.  I mowed, trimmed and dug up the weeds.  At one point, I saw about a 5 foot long black snake on the rocks.  I showed it to L, as it was slithering down the rocks to under the deck.  I was a little nervous, but did a little more yardwork before taking a rest.  A real estate agent came at around 4:30 and meandered about in conversation, eventually telling us our house could sell for 400k.  After commissions and closing costs, I think we'd each get about 45k in profit.  That's not as much as I thought we'd get, and L was a little dismayed by it too.  But on the other hand, it would be that much cheaper to buy her out.  So now I feel like I'm at a crossroads again.  Maybe I should keep the house.  I bought the 05 Matrix today.  So much paperwork!  It's fun to drive but looks a little different from what I remembered -- less sleek, more boxey.  Oh well, it's just a car.  The free cell phone I was supposed to get required paperwork and won't be me for a week, and then I'll have to sign up for service.    I've also been trying to get ahold of our mediator to figure out what paperwork i have ot send back, but I haven't been able to get ahold of her.  I hope it's not too much of a problem.  I don't want to send the wrong thing.  Well, that's enough rambling for now.
