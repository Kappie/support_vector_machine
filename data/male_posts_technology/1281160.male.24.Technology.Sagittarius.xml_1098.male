Ofcourse, it was not a thrilling match, but the way we enjoyed it all together, cracking jokes, what will happen, if an announcement is made that, the next match winner will get Kashmir! If such an announcement is made, then......... The story reeled on and on , containing Musharaf as opening batsman in Pak. team and Vajpayee as Opening bowler and what not comments and arrikais will be there and who would umpire them? None other than Bush ofcourse!  Really, socialising is always a vibrant task esp. when it comes to people of same circle or simply speaking among friends. This I realise, every time when there is a small gathering of friends at home. It gives me the energy to live with for the whole week and no wonder i anticipate weekends like anything and start planning for the next one, the very second its over!   I have seen people enjoying themselves, if they could feel the belongingness and if they feel "themselves" at home. And if, somebody is not able to coz of his/her own constraint or due to outer constaints, then every moment u spend is like spending it in hell though u grin all the time outwards! But what makes u feel urself is a question which always pops up in my mind when i see such events. Can anybody help me in finding an answer?
