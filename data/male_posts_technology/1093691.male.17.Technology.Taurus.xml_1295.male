Then we went for Pizza Hut, I only had one slice of pizza because I was too full up from the large popcorn and Coke from the cinema.  Plan for the week: Tues - Homework Wed - Fix Andy's PC Thurs - See Lora Fri - Homework Sat/Sun/Mon - At Nan's. Tues - School Wed - School Thurs - University Trip Thing Fri - School.
