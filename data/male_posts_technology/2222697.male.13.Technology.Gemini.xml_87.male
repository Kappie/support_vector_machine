If you guys don't know Mr. Stateler was my favorite teacher, he taught me science in a way I have never done before. The School year will end tomorrow at 11:20 am. After I take my reading exam I will be off to home... packing.  "It seems like the end of everything" said my brother. We are moving, he graduated, I will not sleep in this bedroom ever again, and school ends tomorrow.  A few people are coming over for our might of debauchery. It will feel weird not being in this house, I will probably buy it back in 2015.  -out
