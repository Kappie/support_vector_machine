He also said he was counting on the "United Nations' bickering over Weapons of Mass Destruction to save him." These statements prove two points. First, the Clinton era made America appear weak to the rest of the world. By not retaliating properly of the US embassy bombings in Africa, or the USS Cole bombing, the terrorists were convinced that America was a paper tiger. By allowing Saddam to violate multiple security resolutions and not doing anything about it, Saddam also became convinced that America wouldn't attack him a second time. The other thing that Saddam's admissions have proved is that the UN is totally useless. Saddam knew that the UN would never grow tired of playing Saddam's games, and that he could hold the inspectors off indefinitely. There is a very important lesson to be learned here. The US has an obligation to fight its enemies every time they rear their head. To not do so only emboldens them farther. This is one of the reasons why the terrorists were successful in attacking the US on September 11th. Forunately, in the last two and a half years, the Bush administration has been doing an excellent job of engaging the enemy in their territory. Most of Al Qaeda leadership has been killed, the training camps destroyed, and the rest of them on the run. The people who harbored them are no longer in power, and Afghanistan is almost ready to hold elections (if the UN would provide security, like the Afghans are asking for). Saddam Hussein has been deposed, and Iraq will draft a constitution next year, and also hold elections. Libya has dismantled its nuclear weapons program peacefully after seeing what happened to Saddam. The terrorists in Iraq are fighting a losing battle, and they know it. The next couple of years will be crucial in the war on terror. If we let up now, we will only confirm the terrorists beliefs that America is weak. Let's hope that we don't go down that road, or a few decades from now, we might not be celebrating the 4th of July.
