Rini's back!!.......briefing out those 21 seconds....... starting her cooking venture!!!......how far is ur office from ur home?....  now, back to the discussion....Answering to Rajesh.....hey Rajesh i did'nt actually appriciate that party's attitude.....in tamil, we call this as "Vanja pugazhchi ani".....By all means, i was trying to express the same thing which u guys have said....go back  read my post again.....  To Xavier,  abt his " people have a mindset. They believe that you can be well off only if you go to foreign lands alone."......it's not a belief, it's the fact....  to be frank, that's the only attractive force which keeps us here......"thirai kadal oodiyum thiraviyam thedu".......If some Indian coy, is willing to give us an equivalent pay cheque, i swear, we'll get back tomorrow itself..... ideas like, "u r not serving for ur mother nation", are all, junk talks.....It's totally a win-win situation......NRI revenue, is something nobody can deny abt. But i totally agree with your concern for the future generation......yep, they'll surely be confused. It's the sole duty of the parents to clear that confusion....i know poeple who arrange tamil classes for their kids every week end....not just to read  write...but to learn isai tamil, illakiya tamil...... abt the foreign language option....i've decided to take spanish.....which is the second language here.....  poittu vaaaaaraen.....
