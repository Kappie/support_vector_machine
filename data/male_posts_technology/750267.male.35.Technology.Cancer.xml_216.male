"What the world will read into Washington's bipartisan protectionist rant is the unwillingness of a bully to abide by the rules it expects others to follow."   The United States, for years, has been speaking out of both sides of its mouth about free trade. They work hard trying to open up foreign markets for American corporations (there was a great effort to get Kodak film into Japan, a market dominated by Fuji, for instance). But then they pass laws domestically making it harder to other countries to sell goods within the U.S.  The most famous catch-phrase used to describe the U.S. trade policy is an attempt to "create a level playing field". Of course, everyone has their own view of what is level.  The white house says that the main reason for imposing the tarriffs is to give the U.S. steel industry time to reorganize itself to become more competitive. Essentially, American producers of steel have very high per-ton costs when compared to low-wage countries like China, Russia, and Brazil. How are Americans ever going to compete with those countries on price? The answer: they won't.  There are only two solutions, and the U.S. seems unwilling to admit it. The first is to accept the U.S. steel makers produce a more expensive product, and then produce less -- close some steel mills and drastically reduce the size of the industry to a managable level. The other solution is to concentrate on things the Chinese aren't doing -- better quality steel, lighter steel, stronger steel, in more shapes and sizes, better customer service, quicker deliveries... cheaper isn't always better. The American steel companies need to become world leaders again in quality steelmaking.   Instead, they are satisifed with the status quo. The result is higher prices for car makers, and higher prices for cars for you and me. The building trades also have a right to complain.   Maybe the U.S. manufacturers should lobby their congressmen to raise the minimum quality levels of the steel used in car and home production -- after all, there are important public safety issues here. But to have a tarriff just on the basis of price hurts everyone and helps noone. The U.S. steel industry is no better off today than they were two years ago, and they don't seem to be doing any real restructuring or reorganizing.
