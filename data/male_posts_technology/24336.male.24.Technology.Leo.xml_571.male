 Lack of a kensei => New prestige class, weapon master

 Inability to see much of a playing field => Unlocked camera, meaning you can swing the view around to just about anywhere in the hemisphere above the floor around the character

 Boring henchmen => New scripting elements including romance

 Two character party maximum => Ability to bring along two henchmen
