That was a painful game to watch.  painful.  --    Jay put up the next cuisine at  urlLink Fast Food Fever   The McNugget Burger.  I wrote the article and chronicled its makeup.   I also suffered through the indigestion afterwards ;p  ---  I finally picked up a copy of  urlLink Empire Earth  this past weekend.  I like it.  I dont know how long it will hold me.. but it IS nice.  There are just scads of units in the game, and it makes for some interesting battles ;)  ---
