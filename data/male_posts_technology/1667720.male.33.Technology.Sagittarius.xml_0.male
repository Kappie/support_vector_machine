Witness this reaction to people asking for help:   You can see the latter on the axis user mail list, where users complain that they are getting a 'connection refused' error, AxisFault 'HttpResponse:404' or 'ClassNotFoundException'and can somebody please help them. These people should not be helped. There is an informal mountaineering rule that you never help incompetents up a mountain to killed higher up, only down, to get out alive.  --  urlLink Steve Loughran    The previous quote was from a very informative blog entry:  urlLink Sam Ruby: Bruce Eckel said SOAP sucks?
