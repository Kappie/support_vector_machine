Our waitress had that shifty, abnormally high energy, frenetic twitching, can't remember my name, methamphetamine vibe.  Anne and I, being from Goldville, immediately recognize the druggie shuffle after years of seeing people affected by meth.  She forgot to enter our order, messed up our order, forgot to bring drinks, and had to be bailed out by the other waitresses.  She was not rude or mean or anything, just in withdrawl jitterbug mode.  I half expected her to start climbing the walls or throwing things at random, but she barely remained control.  As we drove away, she was outside the back door smoking as fast as possible.  Fucking drugs.  Yes she chose to do drugs, but anyone can make a mistake.  Once you are hooked, you are fucked.
