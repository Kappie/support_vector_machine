But never noticing that of all the departments I've never done any updates to one of the department where they really need to use the system. Yet the worse part is that they don't even know who I am and where I'm from... Duh!!!  Then I tried to update for them. God knows that after the first workstation I've updated, the rest were not working at all. Seems like the network is not working at all and not a single have noticed. Besides, I always thought that leaving the PC not doing anything and causes the keyboard get dusty is just a myth. But, today I finally can tell that it's not a myth anymore. Somemore that is in an air-con room!! How could that be possible? I really wonder how long it took to stay the dust on the keyboard until that I could feel eeky about.  Then that morning is over, my job there seems done ~ since I couldn't do anything due to the network failure. Back to the office, I've done nothing much. My computer got hanged a few times, I watched a little "Happy Tree Friends" and here filling my blog. Now I'll be enhancing the system's reports. So lets get busy now..  Chao!!
