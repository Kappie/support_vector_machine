First off, let me say that I have the greatest respect for people of faith who half (okay, three-quarter) ass make an attempt to follow the guidelines they espouse. I may not agree with you, but as a some-color blooded American, I believe in your right to believe. Having said that, I strenuously urinate on those who proselytize a religion without following its basic tenets (read: hypocrites).  To understand my position, you need my history. For those of you without the benefit of a spare lifetime, I will summarize:  At age six my mother sat us down (me, my older sister, and herself) and informed us: Mom: WE don't believe in the bible. (even at that age, I wanted to question the wisdom of flatly informing me of what WE believed, but I didn't. I respected her ability to hit.) Mom: I think a bunch of people just made it up, then a bunch of fools decided to believe in it.  Okay, so we were atheists. Flash forward seven years, after the mormon missionaries talked to us. Mom: WE believe in the bible, book of mormon, pearl of great wisdom and whatever else I say.  Flash forward three years to some Baptist church. Mom: WE don't agree with the mormons. They are a bunch of godless heathens. Sunday School Teacher: Rock music takes control of your mind and makes you commit heinous acts, like underaged sex and taking drugs. Me: These people are weird. Mom: Shut up. Church is in session. Preacher: Women should be subservient to the needs of their men. Mom: WE're gone.  Next year at another Baptist church (hey, where you gonna go around here?). Preacher: Breadwinners, do your thing as long as you pitch in 10%. Mom: WE are Baptists.  I'll pick this up tomorrow.  I promise anger then.  Messianic, out
