Since it's basically a given that whoever SWAPO's designate is, will win, it looks like he's the next President.  I won't say that it's a bad thing. He's known as a reserved man, not a flaming extremist who calls whites 'snakes' at party gatherings (ala Nujoma)... however, the man is basically a Socialist, whereas Hamutenya was very much a capitalist. Had Hamutenya won it, this country's economy would most assuredly have grown. As it stands, it looks like we're merely in for 'more of the same'. This definately means that land seizures will continue, however.  At least the third guy didn't get it. Angula is one of those types who blame everything, ever, on their 'colonial oppressors.' Meteorites could fall from the sky and eradicate the capital tomorrow, and it would be the Boers' fault.
