 This could be really, really bad.  I hate to think that the best player of our generation and probably one of the top five players of all time has earned his reputation through the use of illegal substances.  I don't think baseball wants to go on any more.  They have one team that is willing to spend 50% more than their closest rival (the Red Sox).  Their players union and team owners are so far apart on most issues that they have to have a strike or lock-out every three years or so.  And now the superstars in the sport are under heavy scrutiny because of this BALCO scandal.  What a ridiculous business.
