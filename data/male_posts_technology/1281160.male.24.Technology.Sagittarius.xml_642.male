Yes machaan...for me too... i too have the same kind of feeling that u have as if we lost something... May be we wud hav lost our good friends (!!!!!) and unfortunately we ended up getting into all new contacts in our UG and more precisely in our PG...(diyounnnnnn!!!!!!!!!*!*!!**!*!*!) The kind of bad and bitter PG life...(ha ha ha...) may be the reason which wud have made you feel so. ok da past is past...hereafter dont spare any efforts to make your life full of joy and surrounded by good ppl.(Like me).  Mahen
