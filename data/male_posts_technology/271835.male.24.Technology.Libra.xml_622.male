The  urlLink Guide to Springfield USA  has a very detailed map of all the locations you could think of. They've done this by mapping the relative locations of buildings etc as seen during episodes of The Simpsons and have ended up with a map in 9 large sections. I'm still trying to find the Simpsons' house.
