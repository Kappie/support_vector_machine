As I'm listening to it on random I notice that even though it is playing randomly - the 4 extra songs are played together (just not in the same order)...  On a separate occasion I'm listening to my Get your Rock on CD (including such hits as It's Over Now (my new theme song) by Coverdale Page and Elegantly Wasted (me on Friday nights) by INXS... at any rate there are exactly 5 Aerosmith songs on the CD... again I listen to the CD on random - et voila - the 5 Aerosmith songs (scattered randomly on the CD) are played one after the other...  Freaky - I think so...
