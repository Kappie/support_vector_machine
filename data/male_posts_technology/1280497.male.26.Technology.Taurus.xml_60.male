Okay--the last portion of the article (which is quite long) reads as follows:  t's not hard to see how outsourcing to India could lead to the next great era in American enterprise. Today, even innovative firms spend too much money maintaining products: fixing bugs and rolling out nearly identical 2.0 versions. Less than 30 percent of R spending at mature software firms goes to true innovation, according to the consulting firm Tech Strategy Partners. Send the maintenance to India and, even after costs, 20 percent of the budget is freed up to come up with the next breakthrough app. The result: more workers focused on real innovation. What comes after services? Creativity.  What do you think about that? I would like to believe it, though there's plenty of ulcers to be created along the way, especially for those who have to retrain to get another job when theirs goes away.
