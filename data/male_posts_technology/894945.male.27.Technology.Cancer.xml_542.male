It was very funny and creative, although a little long for me and I have eaten to death by bloody mosquito's! Bastards!  Random thoughts I had today:  Why do people with less talent than a bar of soap insist on auditioning for Pop Idol and having Simon Cowell rip them a new a-hole? Why don't there friends have a quiet word and tell them not to commit social suicide?  Could I survive solely on carbonated water and those little Twister ice-creams?  Why does the heat make people stupid? Walking around town today, I saw people walking into lamp posts, tripping over little yapper dogs and being generally dumb. Then I forgot my swipe card and felt dumb too, having to call a co-worker to come and let me into work. Bollocks. :7  Why do people wear no sun block, STILL spend all day on the beach despite feeling like a boiled lobster and then wonder why they look like a sultana the next day?  Why do HMV do a "buy one get one free" DVD offer, then charge double the normal price for one DVD anyway?  Will Brett actually make it up the "Miss Battle of Flowers" float this year before security guards windmill him?  Anyway, turn your speakers up and watch this  urlLink flash animation.  God bless the internet.
