Sunburn on the tops of your feet really sucks.  There are a lot of little tiny rocks at the beach, more than, say, 100?  Duh?  When Anne says "I think I know what you are thinking", it just might scare the shit out of her to know what I am really thinking sometimes.  I should tell her the real, honest fucking truth sometime just to get her attention.  DO NOT try to figure me out, it cannot be done.  In my next life, I want to do nothing but play baseball.  I would be happy to be good enough to toil in the minor leagues for 10 years.  My therapist is making it all up as she goes.  She really has no clue about me.  Canadian Bacon was really funny on many levels.  Anne swears she doesn't have my testicles in her purse - maybe they will be found next to the weapons of mass destruction.  Dan is fun to take to a "grown-up" movie.  We saw The Day After Tomorrow, the day before yesterday.  It was entertaining in a "nature will get her revenge on our insignificant asses" sort of way, riveting in spots, although it was so implausible that I almost laughed in a few spots.  Gosh, LA destroyed AGAIN, how original :-*   The wave hitting Manhattan was pretty impressive, though, in that they showed the West Side hwy and all the streets filled with cars in a traffic jam, and the water just covered them all, one million people dead in a matter of seconds.  Still, nobody noticed this wave coming??  Hello, offshore bouys!!  The young girl (whoever she is) had a very sexy voice - she sometimes dropped into a lower octave, totally changing the mood of whatever she said.  I am still pissed at Dennis Quaid for stealing Meg Ryan from me - I was available at the time, after all.  Damn that Innerspace movie!  Hi, annebrev - you wrote me back! :-)  I'll e-mail later.
