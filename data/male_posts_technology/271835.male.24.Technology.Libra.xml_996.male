The last time  urlLink grow-a-brain featured us  we got loads of hits so no doubt the same will happen today.  Luckily they didn't link direct to the post but to the front page - which means if I fill it up with Dogs stories today my thirst for revenge will have been satisfied. Probably.  So without further ado let me present the picture of Dogs after his capture at the Princess Di  waste of money  memorial  urlLink yesterday .    The picture is from a canny collection of 'Owned ' pics - check them out  urlLink here .   Owned pics via  urlLink dumpalink
