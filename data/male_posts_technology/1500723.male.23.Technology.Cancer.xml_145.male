Any substance (solid or liquid or gas ) expands on heating.   c. When any thing expands it becomes less dense compared to the original substance and has so when air is heated it expands and it becomes lighter compared to air outside and tries to rise.  d. Air pressure exerted depends on the number of air molecules present or otherwise density of the air. So the Air pressure inside the hot air balloon should be less and it should collapse because of the Air pressure (14.7 pci) exerted from outside.  e. But Air pressure also depends (directly proportional to) on how fast the air molecules move so when the air is heated the Airpressure inside the hot air ballon is raised to such an extent that it equals the air pressure exerted from outside and hence air balloon doesn't collapse.    Archimedes principle - Principle of buoyancy  Buoyancy is the loss in weight an object seems to undergo when placed in a liquid, as compared to its weight in air.  Weight :- weight is nothing but a force towards towards the earth.. which depends on lots of things the density of the medium in which the substance, buoyancy of the medium and the density of the substance tooo.   Wow!!! What an example to explain a boomerang???  you've experienced this effect. You shift your weight on the bicycle so that the top of the wheel moves to the side, but every bicycle rider knows that the bike doesn't tip over as it would if it were standing still, but turns to the right or left instead.   The wing lift that boomerang gets because of the design of its wings acts similar to the weight that we apply on the bicycle and causes it to turn...
