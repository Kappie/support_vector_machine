There was glass in the sand! It was awesome. We played soccer and frisbee.  Jay, my roommate, left for a month-long tour with his two bands,  urlLink He Who Corrupts  and The Killer. Hopefully he'll come back in one piece.  My fourth-gen IPod came last week. It's super sweet. I love it I love it I love it.  alright. off to work.
