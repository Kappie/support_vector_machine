Whenever I would get a good idea for a story, I would think about for a good long minute, and then SOMETHING would come along to either distract my train of thought or otherwise. My idea for the story goes to hell and I never really complete it. The real problem behind this is my inability to focus on one thing for a long time (my work usually frowns upon doing that). I think I always have to be doing/thinking of something other than what I am currently doing, thus my mind is split such as the processor that governs our computers. The only thing that separates the my mind from a processor is the fact that it can prioritize the focus of certain tasks it is given. I have yet to learn that trait, or if I have, it is a poor implementation to what I want to do with my ideas (creatively speaking). It is easy to prioritize office/work tasks. I can do take without even thinking about it. It's when you're creating something completely out of the ordinary when your mind becomes utterly useless because you cannot focus on anything besides what's going on.   I'm sure it's a trait that, if I do start writing stories, I will eventually learn and do well at.   So it's my mom's birthday. I'm taking her and family to Parker's Lighthouse at Long Beach. She seems to really like it there. I don't know, when I've always gone, the food was overpriced for what it was, but if my mom likes it there, that's where we're going. It's funny, I think she's turning 53, but she doesn't look it. I guess there are some people that really look their age. Usually, it's attributed to all the bad stuff they have done to their bodies over the course of their life. Smoking, drinking, unhealthy eating, and other such vices can cripple the body when it becomes older. It's funny, but it's no wonder some old people are pissed all the time. They don't understand why they're getting older and weaker, thus they become senile. They want to keep doing everything for themselves, and while that's a remarkable trait, how can you do anything when you do not have the energy to do so. I've made up my mind that when I get older (significantly older). I will not drive on the streets (if it's called that when I'm 70+ years old). I will not attempt to adhere to my "old ways" and make an effort to see the good in what's current. I will stay in my house and take care of myself (even if I can not under my own power...I will attempt to do so), and if I cannot then I (would much rather kill myself) would seek the proper help. But the most important of all, I would spend my time finishing all the games that I have amassed over my lifetime. Even if my hands are old and gnarly...and can barely keep up to speed with the younger kids...I would still try.   Wow, thinking about all this makes me tired. So I go now.
