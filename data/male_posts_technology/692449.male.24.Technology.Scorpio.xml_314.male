This is the week before spring break so all my teachers have tests and papers do this week so I'm spending all my time at the library writing, studying, and doing problems. Other then being super stressed out though I'm doing pretty good. Susan is also stressed out because her classes are also pushing her hard. Mikey's job seems to be pushing him really hard and I don't think he gets as much time to relax as he should. Epw has a new job as a computer repair guy. Adam is doing pretty good. In other news  urlLink here  is a really interesting article about Fermionic Condensates.
