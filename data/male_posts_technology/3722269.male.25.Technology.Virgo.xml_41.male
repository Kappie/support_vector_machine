I've certainly flipped the sleep ratio around - but with the hope of it stopping this chesty cough shizzle. Being sick, sucks, but I'm still smiling from ear to ear. So many special people in my life. Hopefully some friends from auckland might pop in this afternoon, that'll be cool.. havent seen either of them for probably over a year. I'll give them the low-down on the tourist activities :D Grocery Shopping tonight, all out of healthy foods... either grocery shopping or pizza ordering. hmm.. pizza :D nah, I'm kidding, I wanna hit my targets. Short entry for now, as not much has happened in my awake hours today yet. Omelette on for lunch, yo. Peace.
