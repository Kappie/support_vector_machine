Names of users and tty's can be given, in which case last will show only those entries matching the arguments.  The  Lastb  command is the same as  last , except that by default it shows a log of the file  /var/log/btmp , which contains all the bad login attempts.   The pseudo user reboot logs in each time the system is rebooted. Thus  last  reboot will show a log of all reboots since the log file was created.   OPTIONS    -num      This is a count telling last how many lines to show.    -n num      The same.    -t YYYYMMDDHHMMSS      Display the state of logins as of the specified time. This is useful, e.g., to determine easily who was logged in at a particular time -- specify that time with -t and look for "still logged in".    -R      Suppresses the display of the hostname field.    -a      Display the hostname in the last column. Useful in combination with the next flag.    -d      For non-local logins, Linux stores not only the host name of the remote host but its IP number as well. This option translates the IP number back into a hostname.    -i      This option is like -d in that it displays the IP number of the remote host, but it displays the IP number in numbers-and-dots notation.    -o      Read an old-type wtmp file (written by linux-libc5 applications).    -x      Display the system shutdown entries and run level changes.
