Other times you can see them coming...   I reckon the only reason I'm feeling so sorry for myself at the moment is because of the past three weeks... I reckon I hit the crest of a mighty wave... the only problem with that is that you have to come down with it at some point :-P And when you come down with it, you come down hard :-( Oh well, howzit reality, how you doing? Heh heh :-) Reality is a bitch ain't it? I mean seriously...   So I know I can get with any woman I set my sights on (not bragging here, merely stating what I percieve to be the truth). So I spose, now I'm looking for something special... something to keep me up nights, all night ;-)  The funniest thing about all this is, normally, what keeps me in a relationship is the thought of sleeping with the woman. Since all of these woman give themselves up so easily, there's nothing to really look forward to is there? In the beginning stages of a relationship, before you get together and get down and dirty in the bedroom... You know quite a bit about the person, you know them... You sleep with them to deepen the connection, and then it doesn't matter whether they were good or bad in bed, you wanna see them again because you like them as a person (god that sounds gay :-|).   Now be honest, if you sleep with a woman on the first date, as a man, do you really think there is any need to see them again? (unless they were really fantastic in bed...). You don't really want to get to know them better, cause you know on the basic animal level what they about. What they look like, naked!! And so on and so forth.  I guess what I'm trying to say here is that its a fucking fantastic experience to have a few one night stands. But the loss of connection, the loss of companionship which normally comes with being with a woman leaves you feeling somewhat empty, somewhat shallow, nothing. Which would explain the feelings I'm going through at the moment.   Oh well, not a bad thing mind you. I've had myself a blast. I think now is the time to call the chicks I've encountered in the previous weeks and see if I can hook up with one of them for a while. Have a bit of fun on and off with them. Will have to see. I'll give the one from the party the other night a call tomorrow and see if she's keen on seeing me again.
