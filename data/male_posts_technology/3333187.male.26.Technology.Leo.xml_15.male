She told me week's ago and today she is now gone. There is no point going on. I'm back on the sauce. I'm going to fall off the wagon.  I'm going back to my old habits, sauce all the way. I'll start with tomato, and work my way up to Tabasco. There no point in trying to reason with me I don't care anymore....    If you want to find me, I'll be in Eddie Rockets with a bottle of Hines and a jar of mustard.    It a good thing I kept my cool... After all she is only going on Holidays for a week!!!!
