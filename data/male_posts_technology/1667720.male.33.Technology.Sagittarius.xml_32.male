One day (2-2-2004) we decided to get into shape. At that point I weighed 219 lbs, which is a lot considering that I’m 5’8’’.   After spending several weeks fixing our diet, we joined our local athletic club.  At that time my workouts consisted of ~20 minutes on an  urlLink elliptical machine . I continued to visit the gym ~3 times a week and after several weeks, I was doing 45+ minute workouts and feeling better than I had in a long time. After about a month a friend ( urlLink Martin ) invited me to play racquetball and thus began many weeks of running around in a white box sweating profusely. Loads of fun. :-)   After a couple months of exercising, I was happy with the progress I was making and I was certainly feeling better. At this point I had lost somewhere in excess of 15 lbs and my old cloths were starting to fit. I decided to step up the demand I was placing on my body so I began running. The more I ran the more weight I lost and the better I felt. So far, so good.   Somewhere around the 40 lbs mark I heard about sprint distance triathlons.  More to come.
