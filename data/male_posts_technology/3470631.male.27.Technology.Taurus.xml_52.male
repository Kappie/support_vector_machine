He's in a huff telling me that the whole Yankees team is there in the VIP section and that he's standing shoulder to shoulder with AROD and Bernie Williams.   15 minutes later he calls me up and says that he introduced himself to AROD and that AROD blew him off. Great stuff. According to him though he said something like "Hi Mr. Rodriguez, it's really great to meet you - GOOD Luck this weekend."  Sickening. Nice going Cusick. You fucking pussy.   2 hours later I get a call from Cusick saying he's been in a fight. This is where the drunken Qdog takes over and the details are still extremely vague. Something to do with his buddy hitting on some girl with a boyfriend. etc.   An hour after that I get a call from Cusick saying that he is now solo watching girls come out of Daisy Buchanans.I'm speechless at this point...  Minutes later he's finally back at the apartment eating doritos and pounding gatorade on our couch throwing out gems like: "The Qdog is in trouble-- repeat the Qdog is in trouble"   I left him watching Strip Poker on the Playboy channel at3 am.
