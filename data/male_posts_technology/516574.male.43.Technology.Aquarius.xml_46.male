I"m going to take a slightly different tack and list the one track that I invariably skip over on each of these CD's that I would otherwise play straight through on a pretty frequent basis (I know it's a short list -- the total time's about 44 minutes -- but I wanted to stick with  just  those cuts I *always* skip on CD's I otherwise like...):  1. Theme from Flood - from  Flood  by They Might Be Giants 2. Counting Blue Cars - from  Pet Your Friends  by Dishwalla 3. And God Said....... - from World Party's  Bang!  4. Mademoiselle Mabry - from  Filles de Kilimanjaro  by Miles Davis 5. One of Us - from Joan Osborne's  Relish  6. Mr. Webster - from  Headquarters  by the Monkees 7. Me and a Gun - from  Little Earthquakes  by Tori Amos 8. Ramshackle - from Beck's  Odelay  9. Untitled Blues - from  Talkin' Verve: Roots of Acid Jazz  by Roland Kirk  [  DISCLAIMER:  I have tried in the past to work past my dislike for #'s 5, 6 and 7, and expect to try and do the same with 4 and 9 as well at some point in the future -- right now, though the first three and #8 are all not ones I *ever* envision getting over -- although I have been wrong before (though I can't remember when...) ]
