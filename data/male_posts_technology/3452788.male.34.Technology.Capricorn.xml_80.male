It feels really good to feel better.  I am doing stuff with the kids, there is less tension, they are not stressed trying to figure out my behavior, I am not being overly picky or critical or intolerant.  It is in these moments when I think I can see a future where I am in control of the depression, rather than it being in control of me.    I still have a hard time concentrating at work, but maybe I just feel less guilty about it at the moment.  Let's shelve that for now.     I am writing this in the living room on my laptop.  I tried to start at 9:20 when I sent the kids to bed.  They interrupted me several times until 10pm, when Anne came home.  I gave up until 11:30 when she went upstairs, then Nikki comes out at 11:40, then I have to investigate what the cat is dooing at 11:50.  Too many sounds, too many noises, too many people around.  PLEASE just leave me alone and let me write.  When I write, everything feels better.
