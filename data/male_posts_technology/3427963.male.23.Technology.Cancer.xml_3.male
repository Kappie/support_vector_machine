Ironic huh?? and at the end of the day they blame u for not calling or contacting them. But i guess ppl need their own time and space also lah huh??   well, thats me i guess, someone who dont realli express my feelings openly. Someone who wld rather keep everything to myself (sometimes). Thats y the one i liked/loved wont know my feeling towards her and i will be so miserable. Keep thinking too much and making myself sad and down for the entire week. Try too hard to make it known w/o expressing it out verbally by caring and showing concern...in the end....remember i came across this phrase which i agree totally, "men express their feelings thru actions instead of words". well, that totally describes me.  Really miss her lor.....been so long since i last seen her( to be exact, ard 2 weeks onli lah). She agreed to meet me for clubbing wif few of my frens she knows last fri but on fri she msn me and say she got an appt and couldnt make it and that she wants to minimise clubbing cos of her coursework and job. Ok, its fine wif me. She said she would come for my debut performance at Safra Muchuan on sat nite and she even said she written it down on her organiser. But on sat, i sms her and she never replied. Thot she would come and was realli looking forward to seeing her but she didnt turn up even though i smsed her the exact location which of cos she nv replied. She never even called..... :( I was disappointed. Even though i enjoyed the experience of my first performance at muchuan but i feel that i will enjoy it more if she was there. After the performance, i smsed her again and again she nv reply. So i called her and asked her where she is. She said :" Devils, jus reached onli" which was ard 11 plus alrdy.(and she say she want to minimise clubbing).  "With who", i asked.  "Vive and a sec sch gal fren, u?", she claimed "still at muchuan", i replied "wah so late still there", she commented "yup, going for supper wif the new frens from muchuan, u enjoy urself then", i said "ok bye", she said and hung up.  well, i tried not to think about it so much but when someone u liked so much didnt even bother to reply ur sms, the feeling sux. On Fri, she msn me in office and ask me if i had replied her on the digicam question. I replied that she didnt asked me, and she asked me if i have a digicam which she could borrow for her brother to take some snapshots of his shop to be posted on web. i agreed intially but advice her on some things which i want to clarify. i asked her to be careful and take care of the cam cos my mum paid for the cam and i will be lending it to her without my mum's knowledge and she would have to return it asap after use to prevent my mum from finding out. As there was once my sis lend a cam to her fren and upon returning the cam was faulty and my mum made a big fuss out of it. As i dont wan things like that to happen as u know lah, it get very sensitive when it comes to money and stuff like this and cos i liked her so much, i dont wan things like this to happen. Then she said:" nvm lor, i also scared i spoilt it, its ok i can borrow from other frens". Am i wrong to make things so clear? Is she angry or upset that i brought that up? I dun know lah.....i even offer to help the brother take photo and send it over to her. can someone advice me if i'm wrong?? I realli like her alot lor and she jus ended a relationship. I understand she needs time and it realli hurt me when i hear or see her cry. But does she realise that i like her alot? i dont know? do i realli have to spell it out? isnt it obvious?? Can someone tell me wat to do.....missing her like fuck and been thinking of her so much that its realli going to ruin my life. Now i understand the meaning of " bei ai shi xing fu, ai ren shi tong ku".  Lastly on my debut performance at Muchuan Safra Town Club. It was realli rush lah the schedule, Ah Du, one of the singer there informed me of the performance onli on last wed's nite @ ard 11 plus and i was suppose to meet him for training the following nite after work. and i didnt even have time to search for lyrics of songs i want 2 sing, did a crash search and came out wif a few songs which i dont feel its enough. I was teamed up wif Ah Du who play the keyboard for us, a fellow female new singer( that nite was her second performance) called qiu qun, a nice guy who had been in muchuan for a couple of yrs who is suppose to do all the toking that nite cos we r new and would not realli know how to make the show interesting. his name is Jie Hao. Well, i did screwed up a few times and luckily theres not much audience present. onli a few tables occupied. I was having my vocal class from 6.30 to 7.30 that nite and the performance is like at 8. I rushed over w/o dinner and the worst thing is i didnt even have the chance to practice wif qiuqun. We sang three duets in total and was quite impressed wif the first two in fact. Ni zui zhen gui by Jackie Cheung and Gao Hue Jun, and Wu Ding by Jay chou and Landy. the last one which is suppose to be our finale song was a disaster cos ah du played it in a wierd kind of way and i couldnt realli catch up with the tune and key, and also cos of lack of practice wif qiuqun....but its all over. my overall feeling? I have a long way to go and so much to learn. Brought along my digicam hoping to capture a few pics of my debut performance but couldnt cos no one to do it for me while performing. but i did take a few after that. Qiuqun left early to catch a bus so miss a chance to take one wif her but nonetheless i can always take one wif her some other day bah. Went for supper with ah du, jie hao, qing shan(head waiter i guess) and alicia(Lady boss of Muchuan) and she was kind enuff to drive everyone back including me whose house is most out ot the way.....realli appreciated it... Really glad and feel so lucky to have a chance to experience all this. Guess life dun realli sux after all, u jus have to make it count ;)  Cheers, Teddy
