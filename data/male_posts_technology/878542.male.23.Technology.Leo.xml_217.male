No matter how you try to prepare yourself for it...   That hope against hope when you see the possibility, and you look, and you were wrong. But you already knew that.   I hate being sad this way. It's so preventable, so easy to see. But I still pretend it might not happen. That there will be a day without it.   Someday it won't always be just confirmation of fears... dreaming of a day it isn't so almost makes it worse.
