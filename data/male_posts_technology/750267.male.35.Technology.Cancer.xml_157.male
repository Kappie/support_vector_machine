( urlLink Price controls can be lethal - The Washington Times )  "The Canadian government requires that pharmaceutical companies sell drugs to them at very low cost, under the threat of taking away patent protection. The Canadians do not pay their full share of R costs - they are in effect parasites."   In the article, the author asserts that price controls discourage innovation, which (in the long term) will lead to needless deaths. Of course, high prices lead to needless deaths in the short term, but the author prefers to claim the opposite.  Let's look at price controls using an example. Let's assume it costs $100 million dollars to discover a new drug and get it through FDA approval. How much profit does the drug company "deserve" on this amazing discovery?   In the investment world, 10% a year is considered a good rate of return. But let's be generous and give the drug companies a 30% rate of return. That's $30 million profit a year, for 20 years (until the patent runs out). $600 million total.  But patents work both ways -- they protect an investment in research, but also give you the right to charge as much as you want. What if you calculated the drug company was earning $100 million per year on that one drug? Or $500 million per year? Or $1 billion per year? Is that a fair rate of return - 100%, 500%, 1000%?  I believe governments have a responsibility to ensure both parties (the drug companies and the patients) are treated fairly in the marketplace. Yes, drug companies should make a reasonable rate of return, considering the financial risk they must take in research and development for drugs that may not work out. But patients also need to be protected, so that a legal monopolist is not allowed to gouge the consumers just because they are the only cure in town.  I once had a dream that I had discovered a cure for cancer. In my dream, I charged $1 million per patient to cure the disease, and earned $100 billion in one year. Only once the millionaires were cured, would I lower the price so that the middle classes could afford to be treated. Not that I wouldn't deserve a healthy reward for discovering a cure for cancer, but in real life, I hope the government would step in and force me to charge a reasonable price (say, $10,000) so that more lives can be spared.
