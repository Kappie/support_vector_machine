Invitation: 1011x974 pixels, size 120 kb). You could saved a lot of bandwidth by reducing the size a little bit. Just a suggestion. Waiting to get my hands on the hard copy shortly.    Kicha seems to trying something . Good.     I've got a new design lined up for the blog. You can see the original version  urlLink here .    Not heard from the others for a long time, esp., Ram, Valli, Rajesh  Vijay.
