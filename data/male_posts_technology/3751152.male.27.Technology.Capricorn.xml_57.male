I then toyed with the idea of being a pilot and then wanted to be an aircraft engineer - I think that's coz my Dad was involved in building flight simulators. So here I am at 26 (almost 27!) and I'm none of those. I have an obscure job title (Learning Technologies Support Officer) and do a job that people don't really understand so they just say I work in IT. I used to be a researcher, which was much easier for people to understand until I told them what I researched and they got that glazed look.  So why am I telling you all of this? Well today was my annual review for my current job. I've been there just over a year now and the review was to see how things had gone and to set objectives for the future, it also involved re-doing my job description. So after 3 hours of talking to my boss I have a job description that matches what I do and a list of objectives that I can work on over the coming months. But one thing bugs me, much as I like my job, is it what I want to be doing in a year, 5 years, 10 years...? I don't know, I guess I'm just going to see what happens in my field of expertise (which incidently is online learning and is growing more widespread) and take things from there.
