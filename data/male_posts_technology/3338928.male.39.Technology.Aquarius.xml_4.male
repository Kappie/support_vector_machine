Potato and a salad and we are good to go.  Love Actually was the movie.  Not bad, some funny parts.  A bit slow, but we enjoyed it.  Work was uneventful.  Certainly nothing worth writing about.    Spent some time in the yard hacking away at the blackberry bushes and other weeds along side the creak that goes by our house right after I got home from work.  Our daughter came out and put her little gloves on and started pulling weeks near where I was.  Like mother like daughter :-).  Hmm...That is all I have the energy for.  Type at ya' next time.  I am going to bed.  TTFN
