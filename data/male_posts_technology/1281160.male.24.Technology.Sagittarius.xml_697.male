Jax here is the reason why we are not able to name folders and files with certain reserved words...  Illegal file/folder names and conventions for the Windows Operating systems...  The following file/folder names are reserved under Windows: com1, com2, com3, com4, com5, com6, com7, com8, com9, lpt1, lpt2, lpt3, lpt4, lpt5, lpt6, lpt7, lpt8, lpt9, con, nul, and prn.  You cannot use these names for naming your folders and files.  There are lot more reservations for naming files/folders in Windows.   ok then..bye bye and meet u all in my next blog.  Mahen.
