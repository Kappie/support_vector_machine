We've been drinkity drinkity drinkin since Friday afternoon and today is finally his *real* birthday, go twanky one!  There was a "plethrola" of funneling last night, which brought a smile to craig's face, although the backyard took quite a beating in the process.  Today was fun, starting with the usual morning bleezy, moving quickly to the birthday lunch at applebees, followed up by a trip to Triumph in Princeton for the sampler (holla back Doug E. Fresh).  Nothing beats your brother Doug hollain to random people on the street... "What's today?   It's my birthday!!!"  Although it would have been much cooler, had the dude on the bike fallen over :-)  I love how everyone is taking to the blog, yeah it's gay, but you know you still fein for it!  As for Evan's (ieatglueforfunbecauseitgetsmewasted) rules, he can hummm on theez :-)  I wish you wooould "kill and eat me"!  Oh, and shout outs to the two who were beat last night:  Luke La La  Why are they beat you ask?  Luke - Couldn't go pass out in his own bed, :-(  Had to wait on others to finish their biz... La La - Had to wait on Licky and drank a box of wine in the process.  Licky Licky Poo Poo (hova) has to do his thang thang, so beat it! :-)  -Your brother Craig  p.s. - Don't worry La, we still love ya, I wish you wooould post something on this ish :-)
