This game, is done by Microsoft, with the auspices of FASA, the group that created BattleMech in the 80's, later to become MechWarrior.  All I can say about this game?  AWESOME!  My sons and I have wanted it for awhile, and we couldn't pass up the game, as it was marked down to $19.95, down from $49.99.  If you've ever had the urge to run around in giant robots, armed to the teeth, this game is for you.  We've probably put in 2-4hrs a day since we got it.  I've made it quite far along in the campain mode, playing progressivly harder missions.  The soundtrack is awesome, the graphics are just as excellent.  I can't say enough good things about this game.  Both my boys, ages 10 and 7, are both enamered with the game, something I've been, since I started playing the BattleMech rpg game.  I've played all 4 Mech games on the PC, and some of the expansion packs.  If you want action, adventure, and just a good time blowing stuff up, this game series is for you.   Being that the Xbox, has a 733mhz Pentium III coppermine CPU, 128megs of memory, a special video chip from Nvidia, and high fidelity audio, it's hard to wonder why the games on it compare to the PC, as it basically is a PC, running a special version of Windows 2000.  With Mech Assault, Microsoft defintely came out with a winner and it makes me wish we had the XBox-Live service, so we could play other MechWarriors from around the world to see how we measure up.
