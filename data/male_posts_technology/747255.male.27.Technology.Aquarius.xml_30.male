I walked over to the desk where the radio sits and start listening to the alert... "Sever Thunderstorm Watch for Anne Arundel County..." "Gee, hon, looks like we're in for some rain and storms." So I go on with the shower. As we're finishing up the alert sounds again. "Severe Thunderstorm Warning ... places in the path of this storm are ... BWI ... Fort Meade ... Odenton ... " OK... we're right in the path of this thing. So I did my usual; I opened up the weather channel site and the NOAA site so I can look at the radar data to see how close it was and how bad it will really be. Yup... we're going to get creamed. It was a huge line of red returns on the radar stretching from York, PA all the way down to what looked like Quantico, VA. Everybody's getting creamed. About that time I start to hear the thunder. I love thunderstorms. My dad and I used to watch them roll across Tampa Bay when I lived in Florida. It was always a great show. So I always like to watch the storms roll in. I opened up the sliding glass door and screen and walked out onto the balcony. A nice wall cloud just passed over head. The storm was coming from behind us so I'd have to make do with watching it slip away to the southeast. The rain had just begun to sprinkle a little when I walked out on the balcony but it very quickly turned into a massive downpour with about 40 mile per hour winds. It was a great storm. I could feel alternating puffs of warm and cool air make their way onto the balcony. What an event of nature. I'm loving this! As the rate of rainfall reached its apex I glanced down at the cars in the parking lot. The Jeep is getting cleaned again. Good. I was a little tired of seeing the same mud on the sides. CRAP! I don't remember opening the sunroof today! *DASH DASH DASH DASH* It's only about 20 feet from the entrance to our building to where the Jeep is parked today. I'm drenched. Ang asks if it was wet inside like somehow the torrential downpour avoided the Jeep somehow. I turned to show her my rear end, soaked from where I sat on the drivers seat while closing the roof. The cup holders are now swimming pools for mosquito larvae and the center console CD holder is filled deep enough to hold Jaws himself.  I am King Moron. This is the second time I've done this in 3 weeks.
