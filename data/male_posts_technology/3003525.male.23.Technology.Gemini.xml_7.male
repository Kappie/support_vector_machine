Well, at least they have his face on it.  I downloaded somewhere on the order of 1 gigabyte worth of comedy mp3s today. holy shit, this is going to rule! So much good shit. oh man, i'm so excited.  I've still been coughing/snotty as hell. I really hope that this shit is gone by the weekend. I don't want to get anyone else sick, but I think I may have already done that. Meh.   hmm. nothing much to chat about. I'm going in to get my MRI on Thursday. I'm rather interested in what the F is wrong with my wrist, as it hurts quite a bit ALL the time these days. I'm sick of it.   ah well. I need to get some sleep. night!
