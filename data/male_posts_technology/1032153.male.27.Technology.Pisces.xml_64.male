Like the ones who burgle, rape, murder etc. Why is it that heaps and heaps of burglaries go unsolved, and yet we waste time on  urlLink this?    The Great Turia Tells Us There Are Many Racists In New Zealand.  Check  urlLink this.   Let me alert you to this woman's own racist ramblings..... (all articles from the Herald online)  1)  Government minister Tariana Turia says Maori should be on gambling regulatory bodies as of right to ensure they get their fair share of poker machine profits to replace money generated through traditional fundraisers such as housie, raffles and two-up.    2)  Associate Maori Affairs Minister Tariana Turia has labelled the word as "Pakeha" and says the people native to New Zealand want it changed to tangata whenua (people of the land).   - I assume white folk are not people of the land even though they have lived here all their lives? Piffle as Dan would say.  3)  Figures showing Maori are twice as likely to die of cancer than non-Maori show there is active discrimination in the health system, Associate health minister Tariana Turia said today.   Presumably since we have a public health system that makes Maori pay triple what everyone else has to pay, and does not pay their doctors extra for having patients of Maori or Pacific lineage.....  4)  Opposition parties yesterday failed in their attempts yesterday to paint Associate Maori Affairs Minister Tariana Turia as a Government rebel breaching collective responsibility by supporting the Waitangi Tribunal oil and gas reserves claim.   Thought I'd throw that in. Haha yeah well THAT's definately in the treaty.   5)  Tariana Turia, the minister responsible for Maori family welfare, says campaigns to help Maori solve social problems such as family violence undermine rangatiratanga.   "Tangata whenua get frustrated when official agencies tell us how to solve 'our' problems," Mrs Turia writes in a regular online column, Beehive Chat.   "We are the targets of campaigns to prevent family violence and neglect, to improve our health and education.   'These campaigns can further undermine our rangatiratanga [variously translated as sovereignty or self-reliance]"    Presumably in the same way that lower entry grades into university, and free computer courses etc do as well?   But alas, enough already before I die of uncontrollable laughter.  And now for a highly respected and intelligent man.  Sir Apirana Ngata had criticised the Labour Government's move towards a social welfare programme in the 1930s, saying it would bury Maori initiative and create a culture of dependence.     Amen and Amen. And he spoke a true prophecy. If we cannot agree on the fairness of these 'benefits based on race' we must agree on their lack of success. The more that is given, the worse the dependency becomes.
