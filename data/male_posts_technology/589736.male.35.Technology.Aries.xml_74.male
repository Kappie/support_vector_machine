     
      me again, with more advice on happy blogging.   the best page to bookmark (and the only one you need) is  http://yelahneb.blogspot.com .  from here, you can read what's up, and then if you decide to post something, you can click on the  click here to login and post  link on the left side (this takes you to www.blogger.com).  from there, login to "circle of irony", type in your words of wisdom, click on "post  publish", and then click on the  view web page  link in the left and center of the page to see how what you've written looks like on the blog (alternatively, you can just refresh the  yelahneb.blogspot.com page ).   REMEMBER:   don't forget to "post" AND "publish" your missives (there's also a single  "post  publish"  key).  if you only click on "post" and not "publish", the sysop (me) has to come in behind you and "publish" your text - otherwise, it doesn't show up on the blog.  everyone wants to read what you have to say - don't deny us!  ;)
