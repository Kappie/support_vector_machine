LOL  E was the first to arrive and I can tell you how strange it was to have her there.  Imagine talking, not at work, not on email, face to face, with spousal consent...it was strange and wonderful.  She met my dad, which was nice.  She met my son, and they didn't do well together...that didn't surprise me.  I think they've had past dealings with each other that didn't end up so well...  This time'll be better, I'm sure.  I talked to E after and we both had the same experience.  During the party, there were moments for both of us when it seemed like we were in a different reality.  That it was our home, our family, that we were a we....  And now it's something that we both miss, dispite never having had it.  At least not in this reality.  Yet. (hopeful aren't I?)  Okay...time to close...
