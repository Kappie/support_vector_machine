I was home Thursday and Friday and all I really saw on TV were commercials and specials that had something to do with Van Helsing.  Van Helsing this, Van Helsing that.  Grrr.  I even saw the making the movie special on one of those specialty channel.  I guess they had a lot of fun making the movie.  That was about it.  From the very beginning with the techno-classical music to the shot of Kate Bekinsale (sha-wing!) as she swings to the other tower in the end was just pure cheese.  I think it had more cheese than Wisconsin.  There were also so many other shots and lines and scenes and just bullshit that weren't needed.  Stupid one liners like "Don't Die!" (or something like that, were all over the place.  It was a good cast of interesting characters.  Dracula, Frankenstein, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, etc. etc. etc.  CGI effects were spectacular.  I really liked the fight scene with the werewolf and Dracula's natural form.  That was fun.  Oh and  urlLink Josie Maran  also played the last surviving wife of Dracula.  She too is another hottie.  Ahh yes, dirty thoughts of Josie Maran and Kate Bekinsale are just swirling about in my head that I can't concentrate.     Okay so back to the damn movie.  The Good - CGI special effects - Kate Bekinsale - Josie Maran - The story  The Bad - dialogue - music - too much CGI, not enough acting  The Ugly - the cheese factor - bad camera work - more fucking cheese  I really don't mean to be snobby here but it was just a cheesy ass movie.  Sure the little kids liked it but it was billed as this "adult-ish" movie that had a little bit of hype going into it's release weekend but failed to deliver.  Sure this movie will gross big and make the studies some money but it's not going to be "a classic" as one of the critics claimed that it was.  Good detail on the CGI not enough on dialogue and putting substance behind what looked good.  It was all fluff.  How's that for a one liner movie description.  Van Helsing = All Fluff  Unless you are a HUGE Hugh Jackman fan, this movie isn't worth paying full price for.  Now for the CGI and a couple of nice shots of Kate and Josie I would probably pay $5 for that or even rent the movie on DVD.  Otherwise the old school Dracula or Frankenstein would probably offer more.
