I had a real bastard cold at the end of last week and it is only alleviating now! I had a fairly dull weekend really, with only a couple of interesting things happening, such as making a 4ft paper mache egg! and pondering over satellite photos of the sand dunes!! So what new in the life of Baity?........  a) My work are now paying (HA) for me to acquire my HGV (Heavy Goods Vehicle) licence, which means look out because I now have over seven tons of pure horsepower to drive around in, Minden place beware!!! (Baity's coming to get you!)   b) I have decided that my plan for growing my hair has come to an end after spending a day ill in bed and having all the time in the world to think about the situation. I realised that I was growing it for the following reason:   "I was introduced to HEAVY METAL (that’s right pop bitches) HEAVY METAL.....and again....HEAVY METAL! at the tender age of 12 or there abouts when I played my first WH40K battle at my cousins shop, it was 'The Hell Of Steel' album by Man O War. Since then I have praised the 'KINGS OF METAL' and been a brother of metal as best as I can. Now after this initial introduction I continues to listen to various types of metal, and the first CD I owned was 'Use Your Illusions pt2' by Guns N Roses (Ok this counts as glam metal, what with old Mr.Rose wiggling his hips like a fairy in 'Sweet Child Of Mine'!). Anyway to cut a long story short, I have always thought up until now that I haven't truly fitted in with the headbangers due to the fact that I didn't have the hair to throw about etc etc.  However, I now realise that headbanging IS exactly what I have been doing for the last five years and in actual fact, it isn't the long thrashing hair that makes you a true HEAVY METAL fan, but the spirit, soul and energy (or blood, sweat and booze) that you exude whilst moshing to your favourite thrash or fantasy riffs! I wouldn't expect or ask anyone to understand what I am trying in lame words to explain.   So my hair is now shaved again!  Ok I appear to have drained myself with that last saga and I now cannot remember what the rest of my post was about (shakes his head in dismay)! Um....ok....looks like the coming weekend is going to be a good one. Princess Kate's family is coming over and theres going to be meals and drink fests taking place, SWEET! New people to meet, more cool TF photo shenanigans to be had! We have to think of a task that everyone has to perform whilst out, and I am currently working on this with Toaster. I must say that I agree with the main man, that us lot haven't been as active in recent times as we have been previous, but that’s mainly due to us all being quite busy and in others cases, not bothered or just plain shit! However, we have all got great times ahead and the beauty of our little circle is that we have a knack for having a crack (hehe ED!).  Ok my brain is truly blitzed now, I am off the tend the testi turnips, feed the nipple donkeys and choke the arse chickens!  Baity signing off........
