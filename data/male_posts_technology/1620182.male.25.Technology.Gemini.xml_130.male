 Are you kidding me? If that wasn't the all time jinx for Virginia football, I don't know what is. Seeing Virginia put in the same class as (defending co-national champion) USC, (perennial favorite) Oklahoma, and (SEC powerhouse) Georgia is something I did not expect. I can understand how West Virginia might slip into this list. They were a fun team to watch, especially when they completely humiliated Virginia Tech on national television last year. Plus, they have nobody in their conference to contend with them, and their toughest out of conference game is Maryland (at home).
 
 Virginia on the other hand, does not have it so easy. Yes, we have a relatively weak out of conference schedule this year: Temple, Akron, and Syracuse. But our conference schedule is going to be murder. Clemson, Florida State, Maryland, Miami, Georgia Tech, and Virginia Tech are all strong teams that will likely end up in bowls games next year. To win a national championship, Virginia would need to beat all of these teams, a tall feat to say the least.
 
 One issue listed in the realities of title teams is that you need game breakers on both sides of the ball. I'm not sure we have that on offense yet. Marques Hagans is a spectacular athlete, but I'm not sure he's ready to be "game breaking." Wally Lundy and Alvin Pearman are above average backs, but I'm not sure they're ready to take over games. And I don't think we can depend on Heath Miller (the tight end) to take over. Or not. Defensively, we're solid. The entire front seven could be considered "game breaking." I'm anxious to see how the secondary holds up, though.
 
 I have faith. And I have season tickets, so I'm going to be there as a witness every home game this year. Last year's experience was fantastic. I hope it's the same this year.
