We are currently developing the Hospital Information System for our dear beloved hospital. So, we need some information from users, naturally. Just now, we had a long discussion on the user requirements. The thing is, the discussion could be very brief. If it were up to me, it would have taken, the most around 45 minutes. And this with question and answer session. But our discussion lasted almost two hours. And I'm exhausted. Seriously!  This morning, I read in a friend's blog about user support and how the user was extremely inept at searching for things on his computer. In my case, however, he is the master of his subject, so we were in the user's shoes, so to speak. So it took him almost two hours to finish lecturing us. If it weren't for the fact that it was almost time to go home, I wouldn't be suprise if he still wanted to continue the discussion.   Enough of that. Had a rather tiring day today. I'm not sure why, actually. What did I do today? Hmmm... Well, in the morning, I had a discussion with a vendor from Australia via MSN Messenger, then another discussion with a vendor from Malaysia via phone, then yet another discussion, with a colleague, this time face to face. Have to settle a few matters before the week ends. Then, after lunch went to see the user.  On a more brighter note, a colleague of mine received flowers today. She was so excited when I told her about it, since it was I who received it from the messenger. I started to pass it to my colleague's staff, but then thought better of it, and deposited it straight into her room.    Before lunch, I went to see someone at the ICU. He just had his operation yesterday, I think. Anyway, I saw him and we talked for quite some time. He seemed bored with having to be in the ICU. I hope I cheered him up some. He had six holes in one of his lungs. So that lung completely collapse, causing him serious pain and difficulty in breathing. So the operation yesterday, the doctor stapled the holes. Then, as we were talking, a senior staff came to see him, then acknowledged me. The thing is, he looked at me, smiled and said "Doctor" while extending his hand timidly. I smiled and took his extended hand. I didn't have the heart to tell him that I'm not a doctor. Hehehehe....
