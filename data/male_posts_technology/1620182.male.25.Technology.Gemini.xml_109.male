I finally finished Nonzero, which -- thanks to an unscheduled three month hiatus from reading -- ended up taking me four months to fully absorb.  If you'll recall, Nonzero's tagline is "The Logic of Human Destiny."  Fascinating book.  Pick it up if you want to think about why things are the way they are.  I followed up Nonzero with The Tipping Point -- a book recommended through multiple channels.  The Tipping Point basically outlines how information is disseminated.  There are three people who move information: Connectors (people who know everybody), Mavens (people who gather inordinate amounts of information), and Sales People (people who can convince people to try something).  Then there's everyone else.  I am none of the above.  Well, I'm part of everyone else to be more accurate.  Bummer.  What are you?
