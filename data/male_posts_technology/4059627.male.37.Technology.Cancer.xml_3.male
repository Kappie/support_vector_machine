If you like, imagine the soundtrack to A Fistful of Dollars playing in the background.  You know the one, diddle diddle dooo DAH DAAH DAAH. It's on all the good soundtracks for showdown movies.  Well, anyway, if you know the one I mean, no doubt you are currently humming the tune in your head. In fact, it'll probably be stuck there for at least a day or two.  This is the essence of Song Bastardry. The ability to make a tune stick in someone's mind to the point of insanity.  There are a few essential song bastard tunes which you should have tucked away in your kit bag. A few of these include Barbara Ann by the Beach Boys, Duke of Earl and Walk Like an Egyptian. I can't give them all away or I might lose my status as a Master of Song Bastardry.  Consider yourself lucky to be reading this particular blog because you wouldn't want to become an unknowing victim of a true song bastard. The effects can be psychologically devastating. So it's just as well I told you about this.  There exists on the web a flash animation which documents the effects of a particularly bad form of Song Bastardisation. The dark side of the song is dangerous, and should not be played with lightly. For your information, the animation is called "Bananaphone". I will not link to this animation since I refuse to be held responsible for its effects. Watch it at your own peril.  Use the song Luke. Use it wisely. Do not abuse the power of the song. These are the three laws of song bastardry.  Remember those two cowboys? diddle diddle dooo DAH DAAH DAAH
