The day after we take our first load to tyler I end up hanging around (I do not actually know what I am doing before a-kon) for a week or so.  We officially have to be out of the house by june 3rd the day after is a-kon in which I am the slaves of Harrison's parents. Harrison has not had good luck with his money, he may not want to go because he doesn't even have enough to get in. I will then be forced to give him some money or else I cannot go. I am not telling anyone how much money I own but it is about 5 times as much as I usually have stored in my secret place.   ugh  It is 15 dollars to get in for a 12 year old and 35 for a 13 year old. I will lie since my b-day was only 2 days ago.  I can't wait to get rid of all my money, I will post pics and list of everything in my 2 backpacks.  bye
