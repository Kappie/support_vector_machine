This cat died a million deaths and was reborn a million times and was owned by various people who he didn't really care for. The cat wasn't afraid to die... One day, the cat was a free cat, a stray cat. He met a white female cat, and the two cats spent their days happily together. Years passed, and the white cat was taken away from him. The tiger-striped cat cried a million times, and then he died. But this time, the cat was not reborn.
