I'm pretty excited, I think we've got some solid goals outlined and to see them met would be huge for the Youth Ministry missions side.  I also think the MTF is going to love it and to have the church see our students taking a lead in missions would just be awesome. On a related note, K and E and a bunch of other guys are looking like they might go to Kazakhstan for a few weeks with a local, networked contact from MD.  Very very cool.  When I dream of SPACE and the progression I think it should have, something like this is the final, ultimate goal.  A team going to another culture, assisting long term missionaries in helping them with the essential task.  Wow.  And to think, in the year 2000, when I was thinking about summer missions for my dteam, and wanting them to progress through certain experiences, with the end goal of ministry on the beach in Ocean City, MD - that was a pretty cool idea.  It never panned out because those guys didn't get a sense of this kind of thing until probably very late in their senior year.  But as I was thinking about it earlier this week, K and E have fulfilled this dream of mine, they will just end up in Kazakhstan instead of Ocean City.  Hey, it's close... I know I've posted this many, many times here, but this job I have is the coolest one on Earth.  And what's even wackier, is that its not really a job.  Well, it sort of is.... (Do you see what I mean?)
