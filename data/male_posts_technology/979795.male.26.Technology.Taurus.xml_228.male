Probably won't blog much unless I'm like really pissed about something, or really need to note down something. I'm probably not going to Aikdo this week. Just to catch up on some work first.   urlLink Foolz!  I can't do my 200 cuts a day lah. I'll probably scratch my ceiling paint, or my bokken, or even both, if I did.
