You know he's had some rough times with addictions and such.  Anyway, he is graduating from high school this weekend and his mother is asking people to jot down thoughts, stories, verses, wisdom, etc. for a scrapbook for him. Here is my contribution:   My favorite memory of Tommy was the time him, Adam Holt and myself served as valet parking for a family friend's wedding party. Consistently, when there are boys and cars, there is adventure. This night was no different as we had the Price's 4x4. After some time parking cars and attending to guests, the reception started and we had little to do, except the truck, a huge plot of land and some snacks. So Tommy decided to give us a driving tour of the property. While driving around, it seemed like he decided to take a random turn off the road to go up a clearing to a light in the distance. And we got the Suburban stuck in the mud.  I think it was only slightly stuck at first.  Then Tommy put it in 4x4 and floored it.  By then, it was stuck good.  And the truck was covered in lots of mud.  We wouldn't have wanted it any other way.   There in the dark, in the mud, with a whole wedding reception going on up the hill, we sat and contemplated what to do. There was my SUV, Adam's Jeep, and the tractor in the garage.  And of  course, Adam and I wondered, "Where exactly is that light you were looking for, Tommy?" Eventually, we got my SUV and towed the Suburban out of the mud hole. After we got it back on the road, the hole was easily 12-13 inches deep. And really muddy. It's probably my favorite memory because, like most boys and men, we had an adventure.  But adventure isn't the only element in this story. This story, in many ways, symbolizes a lot about the grand story of life, and how God involves us in His epic story of reaching our  world for His praise. Like that night, it's easy for most of us to get stuck in the mud when you  are looking for a light in the distance.  Many times, God calls us to go through hard and sticky situations and circumstances, risking a lot of what we have and think in order to be misunderstood for His purposes and glory. It requires a great deal of trust to go off the beaten path when you believe the true light is calling to you.  And it really helps having a group of friends with you, who share in the adventure of seeking, the dare of not knowing, the risk of getting stuck somewhere with you. Tommy, my hope is that your life continues to embody adventure, risk and good friends willing to get muddy with you, all so God can be praised.  Always your dteam leader, -tony
