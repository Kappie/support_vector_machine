I couldn't help myself for i was completely scandalized.  The point is,  as i'm finishing, and reading the morning news as i usually do...i have the impression that we are being invaded by this american pop culture. More and more, our southern neighboor are taking over...or maybe is it that we're slowly being assimilated...and accepting it. It all started decades ago when this guy named Buck saw his fellow american named Red do some farming...well guess what, it didn't evolved much during the times into copying the culture..and i don't mean farming....sure american culture is funny...mostly due to their incompetency, lack of morality, under average(i'm being generous here) knowledge of an existing world outside of the US of A, and IQ demonstration of advanced kindergardenarism. It wasn't as bad in the previous years, but i think the actual turn out point was when Canadian society started to adopt and copy reality TV shows....oh geez, i feel my stupidity meter going off the charts!!! It wasn't that bad before because most of the shows that were copied, didn't really work well here up north. Not as popular, it would eventually die out the following year..especially the shows in french..(sigh)....but now after who wants to be a Millionaire, Canadian Idol(ok i know, this one comes from Great britain, but americans did make it more popular), the price is right, familky feud, etc..., here comes the horrific and french version of "The Simple Life"(Starring Nicole Richie and Paris Hilton)....dun tun Tuh!!!*dramatic music  Yes, starring two girls named Anne-Marie Losique and Jacinthe, the first one being a brunnette is actually a variety show host, she would be the Mary Hart or Nancy O'dell figure of french TV. The second being a pop singer. Both of them, of course being good looking, will be put to similar situations to the american show....but why oh god do they have to copy a show like The Simple life....Out of all the shows, they have to pay the rights to american companies for this concept...that my 11 year old sister could have come up with. We're already bombarded by stupidity...i mean why!!!!  Oh god, smite me upon your judgement and spare me the pain of zapping into this show accidentally...As Mr. Burns once said in a dramatized testimony(recall the show where Mr. Burns hits Bart while driving and is telling how he ended up hitting Bart)Take me!!! i'm old!!!...  I mean, why not have more shows that are smart..surely americans do have the Discovery channel with very interesting topics...like the one where they show how and when they uncovered King Tuht's sarcophagus.  Oh and i'm guessing that's just the begining...eventually we'll all end up talking like rednecks, we won't know any international news...our definition of international will become Canada and US...ok maybe Mexico, France and Great Brittain...I can picture it right now....as i watch the news and zap around, News on Tv(NOT): Tonight, an internaitonal crisis hits our country. me: how can it be international, if it's concerning our country...meh maybe it's actually affecting the world... NOT: The prime minister's dog attacked a baby! The baby was from a visible minority's background... NOT in a really low and diff. and fast paced voice like the one from the diclosures from adds on toys that we see on TV: of course the visible minority was actually native indians,  and the baby actually sustained no injury what so ever, was was psychologically attacked by the barking of the dog. NOT: Will it affect foreign policy...no one really knows...  has the world gone so lowly insane!!! i mean what are those corporate fat cats thinking...importing those kind of shows!!!! Has the demise of making money over the population gone so low, under the detriment of real culture. Oh but maybe it's a corporation conspiracy!!! oh don't even get me started on big corporations...anyone seen the movie "The corporation"....i strongly recommend it...now i'm working in a big corporation and have to be pro corporations.....but this is becoming ridiculously outrageous....
