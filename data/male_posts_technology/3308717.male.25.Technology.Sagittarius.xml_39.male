He brings up several good points. But only barely touches on the main point which I use in my arguments, censorship. He mentions Howard Stern and Jannet Jackson's nipple. This falls under the category of censorship. The FCC was originally a good idea, however times change and because of that fact, we need to change as well.  As you may have read in some of my other posts, I have found nowhere that the FCC has the power to censor. In fact, that is an impedement of our First Amendement: The freedom of speech and of the press.  Well, you just think about that today as you hear your lyrics bleeped off of the radio, or see a nipple blurred off of your favorite movie. Maybe you can think about it while you're reading the morning paper and get the feeling you are missing out on some facts.    -intX    omnia mutantur nos et mutamur in illis
