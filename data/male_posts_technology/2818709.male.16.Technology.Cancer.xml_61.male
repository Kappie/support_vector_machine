It had been there all year, so one could come to the conclusion that she was not planning on consuming it. I "borrowed" her drink, and furrer/dani/parker/me decided to take the liberty of partaking in the fermented squeezed-sixth graders. They were quite tasty. My companion furrer and I walked back to the HS, and refilled the bottle with an automobile anti-freeze mixture that was neon-green in color. Then I placed the bottle back where I borrowed it from. Now, Furrer/Parker/I thought that it was going to take her a couple of days to notice it, but she almost immediately noticed the un-natural substance, and knew instaniously that it was either furrer or I. Because we enjoy playing practical jokes on the english kook. At first, i thought that she was going to suspend or expell me, but it turns out that she can take a joke.  1:30 - 6:00 pm - My Dad and I went for a drive. First, we stopped at city bites because he hadn't taken the liberty to partake in his noon-time nutrition meal. Soon after, we drove to the optomitrist because I had not had my eyes checked in a few years, so I needed to check if i was blind or not. Turns out, that the stigmatism in my right eye has become worse, and my left eye's vision has grown worse. Oh well. Time heals all wounds...(wtf? that saying doesnt work). We payed the sadistic-nurse lady that was wearing a pentagram, and then we went next door to find me a new pair of spectacles. Me, being a geek, immediatly went to the "matrix" line of glasses, and picked out what I wanted. Only $70. The glasses would take an hour or two to make, so my dad and I went to run a couple more errands. We first walked to "Guitar Center" which has a lot of musical instruments/audio supplies. We went there because my dad needed a "Midi +" cable.  My dad psyched out the geeks at GC when he asked for it, they all had the general expression of "wtf is that?" They didnt have it, so we went to check at Best Buy. Yeah. Right. Like best buy would have ANYTHING remotely useful besides video games. I saw a few middle-school astecians...They didnt acknowledge me...i didnt acknowledge them, typical astecian meeting. My dad and I got bored, so we went back to check on my glasses 30 minutes early. For some reason or another, they were finished. When i put them on, i walked around, and ran into a few things. Damn depth perception. Fix yourself. We then went to audio dimensions to check on the 38 inch tv that would be going into my room when it was repaired. My dad had aquired it from a customer that claimed "Yeah, it works fine, I just havnt used it for 2 years." Oh well. The joke was on him. It cost $180 to repair, and new, it cost $900. We couldnt pick up the tv, of course, because we dont have the $ to pay for it right now, but it will be mine soon...After that, we went to one of the famly friend's house. Well. Soon-to-be house. They just bought it, but it's a "fixer-upper". By "fixer-upper", i mean POS. But, the support is still mostly intact, so it'll become a good house. The man that used to star on the show "Sheriff Bill" lived there. When they found him, he had been buying cases of jack daniels, drinking all the liquer in the bottle, and then pissing in the bottle, and laying the bottle to the side. Needless to say, he didnt maintain the building very well. On the way out, my dad started talking about some chili that tammy made. (we were at ken and tammy's house). My dad had some...problems with that chili. Then, he started talking about how him and victoria were having sex, and then the chili started acting up...*shudders* DAD! I DONT WANT TO HEAR THESE THINGS! DAMN YOU TO HELL. Then I hit him a few times, and we went home.   Alright, that was my day. I'm still trying to let my eyes adjust to this new prescription.
