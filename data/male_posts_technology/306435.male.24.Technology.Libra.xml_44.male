I have started a new shift at work.  8-4:30.  i don't like waking up that early in the morning, but I have found getting home earlier makes me do stuff when I get back from work.   The Bob Dylan concert was cool.  I have already found a bunch of the songs he sang last night on MP3 form live from this tour.  So that is cool.  I wish I could pull off all white suits and white cowboy boots like he did. I was really sick this weekend.  I slept most of Saturday and a good portion of Sunday.  I guess it would be "cool" to be sleeping off a hang over, but I was sleeping of sinus problems.   I had a good time with a bunch of peeps at McKlenberg (sp?).  It is a German bar (owned by my landlord last year...like he was my landlord last year, not that he owned it...like it matters you understand what I am trying to say) in the UC part of the city.    I split some fries with Ann and Mike Matera and the Christian Morleins is a very good locally brewed beer.  okay...well I am going over to Ann's cause she is going to make me some pasta...yum yum...until then...
