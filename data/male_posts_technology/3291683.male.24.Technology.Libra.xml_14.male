A dark purple, "Sugar Plum". It's a Behr color, I think? Just the one she liked most from Home Depot. We were originally going to do the next coat tonight, but that's looking less and less likely now. More to the point, one of her friends was supposed to be visiting next weekend (the 31st, or something? Maybe the 30th?) But now it turns out that they had their wires crossed. Her friend (Theresa) was expecting to be coming  this  weekend. If they hadn't talked last night, Theresa would have just shown up tomorrow morning, and probably neither of us would have been awake. I TOLD her I thought it was a different weekend than the 30th she'd originally mentioned to me, but she didn't believe me... :)  So the moral of the story is: getting woken up at 9 in the morning on a Saturday when you're trying to sleep in is the price for not listening to your husband. Always remember that, folks.  So the current plan is to go to my parents' some time this weekend. Some time tomorrow is a likely thing, but exactly when is still up in the air. Y'see, I have this BattleTech tournament this weekend, kinda. The Martial Olympiad is going on until... The end of August, I think? And my local Commando (the guy who runs such things) wanted to try and knock out three of the scenarios tomorrow. Thing is, last I head, it was a very up-in-the-air proposition... And so I don't know if tomorrow's get-together is still really on. But we're supposed to be going to my parents' after that goes on.  Next week is actually my wedding anniversary. I really don't know what we're going to be doing for that, yet; the plans we had were scrapped, and now everything's up in the air. I still don't even have hera present, because I'm just not sure what to buy. She normally sees all the credit card bills and everything, so it's very difficult to get her something that she doesn't know to the penny how much it cost... I'll have to ask her to just not look at the credit-card bill for the next month or two, or something, so I can sneak her present through. I have an idea of what I want to get... It's just hard to decide, on occasion. And time, of course, is running out.  In other news, I've been paying a lot more attention to  urlLink Board Game Geek , a fun little web site. It has entries for almost every board game in existence, and some that don't really exist any more in addition. If you're registered, you can write articles and such, including Session Reports... So I've been making a point of trying to report my various games on there. Not always much of a purpose, I know, but it is kinda amusing, and it wastes time when I'm bored.  On that note, I suppose I should go. Have fun, folks.
