Plus I have my contacts and task list on the laptop so I was able to use that for a while.   After a while I was ready to start using the palm again...but no.  It went on strike.  The battery will no longer hold a charge.  I have no problem physically changing the battery (side note: the battery is rechargeable and internal, therefore I have to take the thing apart to change it.  No big deal) but I am cheap...err frugal and don't want to spend $30 or so on a new battery.  But if I did I could go back to playing games and futzing around on my palm pilot wherever I go.  Aaah decisions...I will let you know what I decide.
