Brandon and I just told a few funny stories and talked about our different towns and states and stuff (he lives in Virginia). It was nice catching up a little bit and really cool to see him, but it'll never be like it used to be.We haven't really grown apart, we're still pretty much the same guys... but at times we seemed like strangers... what happened in the past is in the past. There's nothing I'm sad about though... i'm glad i got to see him. that was completely cool and random. i hope we keep in touch. alrighty then.... i'm gonna listen to my new cd and stuff... commence comments. (holy crap, that's an awesome phrase... i rule... DON'T STEAL IT).. ok.. *ahem*..    Commence Comments!
