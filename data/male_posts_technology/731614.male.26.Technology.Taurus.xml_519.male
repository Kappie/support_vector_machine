Laydies and gentlefellows more than half the time i havnt got the faintest idea what youre all talking about, i mean i think youre all great but... face it a bigger bunch of crazies im yet to (not) meet, dont take it the wrong way i mean if HAD to be stuck in a virtual house with anyone it would be you... to be sure! I've been google-ing all day and am yet to find some sort of translating device, its a sad  fact but apparently babelfish doesnt speak crayzee.   Happy Christmas in July (or something) Youre the best (phew i think ive covered myself there)
