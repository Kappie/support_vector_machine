So you think about posting resumes to US job consultants with the hopes of snagging a job or two in the land of opportunity. Well thats what a lot of my friends have been doing these days.   But then if you read  urlLink The Economic Times   ( and horror of horrors, believe it ), you'd be worried to death about going to the US for a techie job!!   A story at the start of this month says its a  urlLink tough call for geeks to either relocate or quit ! A few days later... another story appears... which paints a bleak picture of what happens  urlLink when even IT pros lose their jobs . Almost immediately after this, the focus shifts to the Techies' parents, who are described as being a  urlLink lonely lot  by our friendly neighbourhood financial newspaper ( or salmon pink coloured dishrag, but I repeat myself! ). Perhaps that is why it reports that  urlLink Indian techie eves are on their way home . And perhaps due to the combined effects of an exodus of Indian women techies ( who, the financial toilet-paper claims, are not driven by any fanatical desire to be Silicon Valley residents ) and arrival of pink slips in the DINK households,  urlLink marriages of Indian pros are breaking up ! Ohh the woe!!   And now even the  urlLink US techies managing the Indian IT pros are beginning to grumble . They grumble about about everything that has to do with Indians... the time-management, fake accents, clannish attitudes, easily amused nature and even the gold belt buckles!! Frankly speaking... this article does nothing to project the clannish attitudes that Indians harbour while abroad. Rather it comes across as a conversation between a group of bitchy Yanks! The article ends with a revelatory statement... "(This is a true transcript of a conversation)". Well... I'll eat my hat if it was a real-life conversation!!   One notable feature about these articles is that they all been authored by the same person, a certain Lopamudra Ghatak. Either this author is a crusader of some sort or there is some sort of a hidden agenda behind such a string of articles within the space of two weeks! ... Or maybe I'm just a conspiracy theorist!!
