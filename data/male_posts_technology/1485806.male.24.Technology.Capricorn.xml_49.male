Everything is not a coincidence...just a set of plans God have planned that have fall into place...  I have come back to Ipoh to realize that several people i met today have got to know the Lord....yeah a family that is very close to my dad's heart....aka Mr Foong..and family. I guess my joy came when i met one of the family member whom i have known as Jennifer...and her husband...mr foong junior...well have come to know the Lord and have been baptisized...The thing is that Ken Hiew, one of Pure Joy cell members who also have come from Ipoh, knows this family quite well .  Usual Chinese New year to this family is quite bored but most of the time, the motivating factor is that good and "exotic" food is there. But this time around Jesus became the main topic among us "Christians" which makes a good time for the Lord...Wherever you are Praise the Lord ...clap and say Praise God.  Certainly another couple come to know the Lord coz families in Ipoh are usually very bounded to old tradition, feng sui, supernatural stuff....and that is not wrong...they are just barking up the wrong tree..Most of them displayed a hunger for God's presence in their lives.  So people , even as u are in ur respective hometown, start praying for the ppl u met...share ur testimonies...how u deal with life...more importantly how you allowed God to deal with ur life...and what are the results... you don't have to show much scriptures...show your life...just like John 1:1  In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.  Live your life according to the word...and ur life will show God...  remember this to Connect, Relate and Resonate The Faith of Jesus Christ  Joshua Tan Fellow Jesus Freaks.
