If I wanted to, could I find people with whom I haven't spoken for three to five years?  The resounding answer was no.  No, I can't.  Well, for the most part.
 
 So I'm wondering, if the internet is really mean to bring everyone in the world together -- to connect everyone in the "world wide web," then why can't I at least find a definitive reference to everyone?  The reason?  You can't be found unless you are advertising yourself.  
 
 For example, try typing in your full name into your favorite search engine.  Something came up, right?  Why?  Because you use the web and you read things like this stupid blog.  Now try typing in the name of someone who does not use the web the same way you do.  Someone like your mother or grandfather.  What were the results this time?  
 
 In my experience, there are four ways for your name to end up on the web:
 
 1. Post your own webpage under you own name.
 2. Contribute to online forums such as commenting on  urlLink Amazon.com  or  urlLink Epinions.com. 
 3. Contribute to an organization that posts their results on the web.
 4. Be interesting enough that someone will write about.
 
 So basically, if you are online only to read and not contribute to the world wide web, you are promoting a uni-directional relationship with everyone else in the world.  You are not part of the community.  While this type of anonymity can be useful at times, it denies the true power of the internet.  
 
 I don't think there is any way to overcome people's desire to remain anonymous.  I do think that search engines could be made more useful.  Since most people are not going to contribute to the web, someone must contribute for them.  We need better data sources.  I don't need access to the FBI's database, but I would like to find an old friend with whom I've lost contact and would like to call or e-mail.  Is that asking too much?
