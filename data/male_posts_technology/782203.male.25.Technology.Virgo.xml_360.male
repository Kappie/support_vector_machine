Oh and speaking of which, I was on Business Class on SQ for the flight back to Singapore,while my bosses were on Economy due to some mix-up in Malaysia arranging out flights back. Yeah that was really weird. But the difference in service from Economy to Business is really huge, too bad I only got to enjoy it for like an hour.
