Only this time the organized crime units pulling this off are stepping up and showing their hand a little, none of this crap about exploiting only vulnerabilities that are previously known about.  I have to wonder if this is a scouting excursion, meant to see how fast some of these companies are about bringing down the hammer.  Or maybe it's just a lucky spam group, who knows?  Anyway, with no patch released to plug the two vulnerabilities, IE users beware.  Especially since the nature of the exploit is allowing well established business sites and portals to spread the infection.
