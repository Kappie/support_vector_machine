Played some  Fallout 2  recently, and I managed to advance the plot quite considerably. Unfortunately, I don't exactly know what to make of it all, as theres an awful lot to take in.    Managed to catch up on Angel, and even a bit of  Armor , which I have been reading (very slowly) for the last month or two. Reading is really quite difficult at the moment, and its really beginning to annoy me.    Caught half of two episodes of  Without a Trace  - it seems a lot better than I credited for. A lot like CSI, but I think they're both made by the same production company.    Bought the  Lord of the Rings  movie soundtrack trilogy set (its been in the HMV sale for some time now). Generally adequate music, but the little ridge / teeth things inside  all  of the cases were broken or damaged. The 'best' one is  Return of the King , which has only one tooth remaining. A bit like Gollum I suppose.    In other news, I have some plans for an  Exalted  game, but I really need to read the book, which, of course, I can't. Exalted is White Wolf's new cash cow, and is a sort of heroic fantasy type game, with all sorts of backstory, intrigue and so on.    Only problem is that no-one runs it that way anymore.    I aim to change that.
