Well I guess Im enjoying reading about what other people are doing and I'm finding that I dont spend nearly enough time reflecting about what Im doing / or have done.  Hopefully this will slow things down a bit and allow me to look back and say "Wow, I guess I really did do something last week!"  This evening was spent pretty much investigating (still a lot more to go) what a successful blog looks like.   urlLink Rebeccas Pocket  looks like a really good one.  I'm still kind of lost on what to write about.  My day as a Computer Network Analyst isn't really worth sharing.  Basically I drive from one place to the next fixing computer hardware, software, and network problems for doctors.  I guess the most important thing that I've learned from working on a job like this is to always keep an even keel, even when the client is flipping out, and also to keep the ol' ego in check; realizing that I don't know everything about computers and that each day is a learning experience.  I'm toying with the idea of setting up 2 blogs.  One (this one) to focus on the things that I enjoy, and the second to focus on health issues.    I'm the kind of guy who has many interests, but I have this character fault in that I seem to spend more time reading about my hobbies and interests more than I actually participate in them.  There's got to be a label for this kind of behavior, but the name escapes me.  (If you happen to know what it is, please let me know.)
