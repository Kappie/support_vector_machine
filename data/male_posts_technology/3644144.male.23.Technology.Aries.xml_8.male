I am assuming that everyone has heard about the upcoming Oskaloosa Senior High School Class of 1999 reunion by now. (If not, let me know and I'll forward you the email) I was just wondering what everyone was thinking about doing...going, not going, having their own reunion, moving to Denmark, etc. I think it would be a lot of fun to see some people I haven't seen for a while (and probably won't see for a while) again, but if none of you are going to be there...well, that kind of blows that idea! And if you're now living out of state, that's no excuse; I don't live in Iowa anymore either! Ok, ok, North Carolina might be a little far. But anyway, I just wanted to throw an email out there and see who was interested at all in attending the reunion. In any case, feel free to email me and/or the whole email list about what's going on with you and your undoubtedly fabulous life :-) I hope everyone is doing well!  Take care,  Anne aeselene@msn.com
