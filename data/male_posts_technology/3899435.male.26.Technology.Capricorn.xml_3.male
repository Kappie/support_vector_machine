Is there a objective measurement of this state of well-being? I keep wondering what people mean when they are trying helping other people improve their life through social and charity work? I always thought that such people are imposing their idea of well being on other people. It is more like telling all those people, whom they are trying to help, that their life is not good and needs improvement. Can person's life be judged as good.  How can you compare the lives of a software engineer in valley to that of the touareg of the saharan desert? One can never say one being well compared to others. Well being is mostly defined by the instantaneous gratification that can be obtained by each person. (Am I wrong, any opinions?). Can we compare the ability to spend a week in cayman islands to the of making a meal in the saharan desert? Well being cant be coerced into any definition.  One of the main things to have happened with this age of increased communications between people from different parts of world is the imposition of ideas. This is more like the "thought control" being referred to by Chomsky (wll talk about this later).  The state of well being as propagated by the powerful people of the world is being absorbed very well by vast majority of people. And it is influencing other people through "society" aspect of a person. The system is being defined with process by which you can also be part of it.  BTW, folks watch the movie "children of heaven", excellent movie about lives of two kids, where everything they look forward to is a pair of new shoes :)  Have a Nice One.
