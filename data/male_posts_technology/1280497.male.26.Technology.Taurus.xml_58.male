Here's what I like about Chairman Greenspan's remarks: I think he is willing, due to his relatively apolitical situation, to say the stuff that people can't say in other areas of government because they're afraid they won't be reelected if they do; I also think that he points to reality.  I wonder, though, how this all jives with his  urlLink remarks about household debt . I haven't read these remarks in their entirety, and I just wonder how you can say that he's worried about the ability of the government to pay for baby boomers who retire, but in the same week say that it's no big deal to not save anything.
