And now Marc leaves in like 3 weeks for Australia:(  On the upside, I have music to listen to today. I got a bunch of MP3's copied onto a CD before I left this morning, so I have the new Cake, Alien Ant Farm, some Green Day and Dynamite Hack. It's so nice to not have to listen to this game:)  Also, the more I read of "Youth in Revolt" the more I like it.  Dej- do you have this alleged "Last Unicorn"? I would like to read it. :)
