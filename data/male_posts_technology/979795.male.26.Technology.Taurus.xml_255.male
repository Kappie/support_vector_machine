All the while my parents were nagging in the backgorund .... buuuuuzzzzzzz. Didn't get any peace until after it was found. Sheeez... Left the house with Lynette and both our parents for Uni. Drove down, despite my recommendations to walk down. Weather was really dark and gloomy. No sun today. Duh...  Went to collect our convo tickets and the gown in the Avon Room, University Ctr. It was quite easy to put everything on. Was really chop chop. I must admit, despite having only achieved 3rd class, I still feel rather proud to be wearing it. Dunnoz, maybe it's normal for under-achievers like mua. Hyuk hyuk hyuk. We went around the Uni to snap some shots before the doors to the Great Hall opened. That would be where the ceremony is gonna be held.  Our parents went in to grab good seats in the front row as soon as the doors opened at 930am. Lynette and I met some people here and there and decided to take some photos with them before we had to be seated in the Great Hall. Took us awhile but we went in by 10am. I kinda fell aslwwp while waiting and I was jolted awake by the orchaestra's fanfare that followed when the procession (of Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor, lecturers, etc, arrived. It looked nice and kept me awake pretty much for the whole ceremony. The Great Hall was kinda warm, and I'm sure the shirt, suit, tie, gown, and hat didn't help to keep us cool. We listened to some speeches (less than I had expected, which was good), and preceeded. I was lucky to be the first half of the ceremony. Saw a few familar faces here and there. At the end, we followed the main procession out of the Hall. A lot of waiting around before the dept photo was taken. Paid £21 for it. My parents finished 2 roll of films which we sent for developing in the Uni Ctr.  When we left, the mood (expectedly) turned irritatingly and nasty. Parents were like blaming each other about where we can grab (cheap) lunch. Of course, I got part of the blame (as usual). The graduation day had to start and end in a crappy manner. I'd say that's a tradition. What a day.
