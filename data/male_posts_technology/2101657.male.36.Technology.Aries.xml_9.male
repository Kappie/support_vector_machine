I heard more volume and sound out of this band, then I have from college Marching bands with 200 people.  I must say, if you ever have an opportunity to see this band play, it's most worth while.  Every member of the band is a member of the Marine Corp's.  What I found a little missleading on that part, if I understood it correctly, they are members of the Marine Corp, but never have to go through Basic Training, and are generally exempt from that type of training. They are assigned TO the band and basically nothing else.  They get an automatic rank of Ssgt  , an E-6.  It takes most people on active duty 5-7yrs to get that rank.    The music itself, is incredible. They play alot of John Philip Sousa, and they played some songs from Broadway as well.  The conductors, whom I don't recall their names, are a Col. and  a Major.  There was also a gentleman who came out and introduced each song, and gave a little background on it. He sang the National Anthem, and also in the second half of the performance, sang three more songs. He can sing most excellently.  I was very impressed.    The concert was held at the high school.  We ended up in seats on the 2nd floor, toward the middle edge of the basketball court.  There was local law enforcement to help out, as well as some active duty troopers pulling security. The local AmVets were helping out as well.  There were probably 1500-2000 people in attendance.  I know, if they are back next year, we'll make sure to go see them again, they put on a fantastic show.
