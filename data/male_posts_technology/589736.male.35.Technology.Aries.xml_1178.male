My energy level is as such right now that I know I'm in the big time if I can walk to the living room and back!  But it's okay...'tis for a worthy cause!  Thank God my desk isn't too far from my bed, 'cause I'm such an internet junkie that I'd die if I couldn't blog and stuff...  On a Buffy note, I just saw Amy (Willow's witch friend that lived as a rat for a while) in a Dove Shampoo commercial.  That's kinda sad.
