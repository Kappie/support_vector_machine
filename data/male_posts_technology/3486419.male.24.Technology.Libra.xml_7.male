And so 5 of us (Inge, Sisca, Jon, Alena and Me) brave the 11deg weather (+ drizzle) to watch Shrek II.  "... Sorry guys, Shrek II's sold out.."   And what a fine start we've got for a wonderful evening. All of us frantically trying to use the remaining brain cells we've got after tormented by 3 exams.  "Hairy Potter! and the prisoner of Alaska!", no i mean Azkaban. Basically, the group comprises of 3 charming ladies and 2 suave and cool guys.  "... Sure..Let's do it!"  As the show starts at 2100hrs, we have 3/4 of an hour before the show starts, so 3 charming ladies and 2 suave and cool guys went to feed themselves before the show commences.   Ok. Here's the weirdo  cum eerie cum spine chilling part..To protect the identity of the 'weird guy', we shall call him "Ah Tiang"  Scene 1, Act 1:   Inge       :" ya.. so u know ... that's why la " ("Ah Tiang" aproaches our table)   "Ah Tiang" : "........................."  Stan       : " urhhh. Sorry. u mind repeating that again?"  "Ah Tiang" : "mbubumbfroppo.... boufrybo angel mubmimop..."   Jon        : " errrr u have to speak up..i dun get what u mean?"  "Ah Tiang" : "Sorry, i mumbiob sick... Arch bmoomboiuy very friendly bmioirty.."   "Ah Tiang" : "AHem bimoibnmbi. Archangel has told me that u guys are very friendly people"  Jon        : " Ohhh..."  Inge       : " huhhhh?"  Sisca      : ".........."  Alena      : ".........."  Stan       : " huh.  ok... thanks a lot.."  "Ah Tiang" walks off. That has totally spooked us to the max, trying to figure what archangel is that guy mumbling about.   Scene 2, Act 1 (Inside the cinema)   Basically we were seated like this, then "Ah Tiang" came in!!!! Then he went to repeat the archangel mumbo jumbo to the person sitting at location (V) at Row E        88888888888888888888888888888888888888888888     __________________________________________________ A________________________________________________|     |________________________________________________|     |________________________________________________|     |________________________________________________| E_______ (X)(V)(V1) ________________________________|    |________________________________________________|   G_____________  (S)|(I)|(A)|(J)|(M) _________________|      |________________________________________________|     |________________________________________________|     |________________________________________________|     |________________________________________________|     Legend S - Sisca              I - Inge               A - Alena              J - Jon M - Me X - Weirdo (Ah Tiang) V - Victim V1- Victim's friend    It was definitely eerie. And so i came to conclusion.  1. He's too stressed by exams           - Coz now its the exam period, so maybe he's kinda stressed-out  2. Pay it Forward logic            - Contributed by Inge or Sisca... can't remember. where "Ah tiang" needs to tell     to a certain amount of pple to pass the benefit.  3. Kena Sabo-ed           - Which i think its highly unlikely.  4. Cult Leader           - Fingers away from dialing 000.  5. Trying to be corny           - luckily i am in a good mood, else i will *Beeesh* him and *Zoink!* and *KarPow* him.(Verbally) haha, caught u there, didn't I? Come on, the '79s are so cool and suave, how could we resort to such scheming tactics? Ok. at most,              i will just tobasco his non master eye. *Smirk*  Anyway the show was great.. GOod twist at the end to make the ending so flawless. A  8.5/10  for me. (-0.5 for drizzling, -1 for the weirdo)  That's it
