The first criterion is colour, followed by size, he added. ' A particular horse behaves as per its caste -- horses of Brahmin caste are handsome, calm and well-behaved, ' said Maheshwar Pandey, a horse rider. He said a Brahmin horse easily follows its rider's orders; a Kshatriya caste horse is strong, tough and angry; and a horse of the Shudra caste is considered ill-mannered.  ROTFL!!  Pathetic!!... What more can one say about this?!!
