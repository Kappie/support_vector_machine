The strength of an argument depends solely on data and is supported only by strong writing skills. Hopefully I will be able to present convincing data!  In the 15th Century, Christopher Columbus sailed the seas in search of sea routes to the east seeking spice. He discovered an entirely new continent in the process. That continent now houses one of the most powerful nations in the world. Today the search continues. Man is reached deep into space. Space probes have ventured into the boundaries of our solar systems. Man has already gained command over landing on the moon. He is trying to reach the next planet: Mars. Who knows what such a search may yield. It may not sound very convincing today, but it's a bet that over time will yield benefits far greater than those that can be imagined. Man should never give up pushing frontiers trying to reach planets.  What is it that separates this species of the Hominids from the other species on the planet? He thrives on challenge. It is the challenge that causes him to focus all his faculties on achieving a goal. He builds from dreams and concepts, failure to him becomes the stepping stone to success. It is his will to achieve higher and higher ambitions that given him the power to be the dominant species on earth. Even though improving conditions on earth is important, it should not be a deterrent to achieving loftier ambitions. It holds several economic, strategic and sociological implications, with far reaching outcomes.  Trying to reach other planets is symbolic of human nature to innovate. Innovation is a prime mover for various spheres of life, whether it is business, politics or society. It acts as a catalyst, transforming our very lives. Innovation can be of two types: sustaining and disruptive. Sustaining innovations such as improvements made to methodologies used to improve agricultural output have contributed significantly to our quality of life. On the other hand, it is the disruptive innovations that have the maximum impact on our society. The study of genetics, for example, holds the key to disruptively enable us to solve our food problems, giving us a totally different approach to solving the age-old problem. Totally unrelated innovations in the study of the molecular biology have led us to the brink of quadrupling agricultural output. Trying to reach the moon was a disruptive innovation, as is trying to reach Mars today. In trying to do so, it has opened innovation in several dimensions. It may not help us improve the conditions on earth immediately, but it will help us to reap unfathomable benefits. A cat in a box will never know what lies outside the box till it tries to jump out of the box. Innovation should never be stemmed. It contains the key to survivability.  Even so, the space program has yielded several direct benefits, both tangible and intangible. It provides several spin-offs to the economy. It has affected diverse areas of our general well being from the medical sciences to public safety. It has yielded several technological innovations, with little fanfare, which have affected the way we live. Temper foam, for example, used in helmets, airline seats, crash protection equipment, is an offshoot from the American Space Program. Laser Angioplasty, which saves many lives daily, owes its origins to technological breakthroughs made during the attempt to reach the moon. Communication as we know it today would not have existed had it not been for satellites, which orbit the earth: TV, mobile communications, Global Positioning Systems all owe their origin to space related technologies. Weather prediction, resource mining, all owe a lot to man's strife to surpass the boundaries of the globe. Space related technological has helped countries lead in global markets. It has several tangible benefits to the quality of life experienced by humankind. It is said that money spent on the American Space Program has yielded returns at about the same rate as expenditure on any other government expenditure. It provides employment to many. It provides the industry with a rich talent pool, something that one cannot do without.  Indeed, the drive to reach other planets is a force to reckon with. It reflects the indomitable spirit of man, his constant thirst for challenge and his ability to reap benefits from the results. Would it be wise to focus entirely on one sphere of human life (improving conditions on earth) and ignore the other?
