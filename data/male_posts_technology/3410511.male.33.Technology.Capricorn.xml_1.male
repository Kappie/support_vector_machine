Just after the hockey game - (just wanting to see who the Flames are going to pound into the ground) So, they were making fun of me - they are actually preparing for Sunday school (what love I must admit) in making little booklets for 10 kids... I think Kim is trying to publish a novel (always over the top) and Sarahwah needs some help gluing paper (she puts the paper on top of the glue stick instead of turnig the paper upside down and gluing)  Anyhow, they were making fun and I decided to threaten them with a blog entry - being true to my word (And trusting the Lord He will bless their efforts in the meantime)  Sarah - I changed the spelling!
