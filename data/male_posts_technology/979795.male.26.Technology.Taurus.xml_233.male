Just 2 days back, I played some basketball and got a knock on my glasses. Now it feels a bit dodgy. Sigh, no choice lah, people will probably see me in contacts a lot more often these days.  Today was relatively quiet. Was considering going swimming at night coz 2 of my housemates were playing soccer in school at the same time. But in the end, I just decided against it. Got a bit of a throbbing headache now. Guess, it's better this way. 1 more hour to Friends. A bit sad lah the life here but I think it's coz exams are coming lah. So things just seem a bit more boring. Of course, there's a lot of studying to do. Sianz.  Just thought I'd best update some details on what's been going on before my papers start.  Oh yea, 1 fantastic piece of news. Aikido is still on this term in Uni and at the dojo. Problem is I can't go too often because of the exams. Argh! Looks like I can only go for the coming week and the 1st week of Jun. Depending on where I'll be going after all my exams, I may / may not be able to attend the last session before term closes.
