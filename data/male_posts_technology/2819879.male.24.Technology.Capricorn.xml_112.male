And I thought I'm already used to people parting.  I was wrong.  It still gets me when the time finally comes.  When there's a beginning, there's always an end.  Therefore, the only thing endless, would be something that never begins.  ...  Rather sad to be a mortal.  Maybe A. Smith is right; maybe human beings do define our reality through suffering and misery.  Of course, if this world is without suffering and misery, how do we know we are happy when the time comes?  If we are bind to and will never leave people whom we love, will we still precious the days we spend together?  Probably not.
