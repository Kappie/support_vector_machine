Is it odd, that I come across people that I have a lot in common with, in one way or another, on such a regular basis? I guess it isnt if we consider that like-minded people are bound to congregate in similiar appealing environments. Everything in life needs balance, relationships and indeed friendships (being a relationship themselves) are no different.. we must have enough in common with a person that we can find a level to communicate with them on.. you probably have friends yourself that are particular to one or two aspects of your life, and different friends to satiate the whole spectrum of your interests.. you might have online friends that you can bitch about your day with, work mates you can bitch about the online people with, and flatmates that you can bitch AT for not doing the dishes... whatever. The problem, if we can call it that, is when we come across people that are -too- alike, sparks fly, and not 'attraction' sparks, but more the *want to stab them in an eye with a fork* kinda sparks. I met someone online a few months back, that I hit it off with immediately, and the more I found out about her, the more we had in common, almost to the point of saturation. While our minds worked in different ways, everything else was almost identical.. as it transpires through the passage of time, there werent enough differences in the right places.. this can be true of friendships too, I certainly have my share of friends that are strictly 'enjoy in moderation' hell, I'm probably enjoyed in 'moderation' by some of you, but thats how it works. Give. Take. Balance. Sometimes the people that I most want to pitchfork in the head as much as I hate to admit it, are the people I think are too much like me.. or at least that we clash on the wrong levels because we both try to dominate at the same points. Thankfully a couple of these new friends have the same smart ass sense of humour as I do, so while I might still want to poke them in the eye, i'll probably still be smiling when I do. On a more humourous note.. my friend Fuzzy and I have devised a new product that we think will be infinately useful (I say 'we' it's his idea, I'm ripping it off) Basically its a 9v battery, a horn speaker, an LDR (light dependant resistor) and an eprom, wrapped up in a protective casing.  Huh? Well, basically when the LDR senses 'dark' or nighttime, it starts a program on the eprom that randomly picks a delay (0-4 hrs say) and then emits an annoyingly loud and obnoxious noise for a random duration, say 2-25 seconds, then stops, and this process endlessly loops. Fuzzy tells me on good authority, that a 9v battery used in this manner will last a good number of months. The whole unit would be about the size of a packet of cigarettes. Why? Lob one onto your neighbour/enemy/friends roof. How fucken annoying. 4am *BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP* not long enough to work out where its coming from. 7am *BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP* 7:45 *BEEEP*    every night.. for 2-3 months.  Well, the idea made -me- smile :D So watch out you fuckers.  Ciao
