The United States has decided not to proceed further with consideration and action on the draft at this time in order to avoid a prolonged and divisive debate,' the deputy American ambassador, James B. Cunningham, said on emerging from the council.   This is good from the point of view of cooperating with the rest of the world and ensuring accountability outside of functioning nation states. I still have strong issues with the potential for abuse of the ICC, however. I'm curious to see if it does become an issue with countries using ICC summonses as yet another tool for attacking each other in the diplomatic realm.
