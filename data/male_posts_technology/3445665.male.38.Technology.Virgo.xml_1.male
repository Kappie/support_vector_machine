For me to eat, and for my party on the 12th of June.  Not very far away at all now.  I finally got a couple pairs of bargan jeans, was down to just 2 pairs, now I have 4 again.  I have gotten about $1000 together for buying the new deck materials, but I do not think that is going to be enough.  Might only be enough to frame it up.  Oh well, that is better than nothing.  Working on selling my van, if I can sell it than I will have enough to finish the deck and get a new case to get one of my broken computers running again.  After I got home I chatted, watched a few movies, and worked on a program to break apart URL's.  I watched Something about mary, office space and fight club.  Fight club was a strange movie... if he was the other guy too, who was he fighting when he started up fight club?  This morning I woke up late again.
