Just when I think that they are stabilizing...WHAM! They come back and seem to make up for lost time.  I get kind of scared when I think about the cause for the sudden recurrence. I hope that it is just my body getting used to the meds that I have been taking, and maybe simply increasing them will help.  Don't really remember Saturday right now...maybe later it will come to me.  I do remember eating at Taco Bell, but that was LATE Saturday night. Other than that though, it is all a bit hazy...Oh well, it will come to me eventually...I hope. :-)
