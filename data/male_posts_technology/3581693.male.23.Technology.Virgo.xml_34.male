My younger cousin Dakota - he's 11 now - used to idolize me when he was 7-8ish... never the less, he discovered a golf cart parked way off to the edge of the ranch. He had been trying to get someone to go with him to ride it. He couldn't get any takers - until he came to me.   Obviously the little man was afraid of getting caught - and he figured that if he had an adult with him - he couldn't get in trouble.  Always one for a little bit of adventure - I go along with him to the golf cart. He would like to drive - so I figure I'll be the passenger - not too many options.  Anyways, within two seconds - he had the thing in reverse and he just puts his foot on the gas peddle. The thing just rockets backwards - into a ditch.  I'm thinking - hmmmmm - no problem - first time should be a little rocky... let's show him how to go forward.  Nope - not happening - the golf cart is now stuck. The rear wheels just spin as if they are stuck in the mud. There's just some grass underneath them.   I say to myself - we need some friction under the wheels. There's not much around to choose from - so I get some rocks - and have him try again.  Left a nice burnt rubber mark on the rock. Then we tried some cardboard - dumb idea.  After about ten minutes of trying and getting all nice and sweaty - I decide to give up. It was a good effort - but the golf cart wasn't meant to be ridden.   Of course I have to take the blame for the whole situation - thank goodness it didn't come down to that...  Dakota obviously had no problem telling people that it was me who got the golf cart stuck - trying to save his own ass or something - he didn't need to - oh well, a couple more years experience and he'll learn that ignorance is bliss.  In the end the owner of the place had to get a tractor out to get it unstuck - and many people said to me waaaay to go Shaun.  Meh - all in a good day's work.
