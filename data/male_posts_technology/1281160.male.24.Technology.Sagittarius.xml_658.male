Xavier...I'll try my level best to make it...but cannot assure you....cos next weekend is Diwali...anyway can you tell me the exact place of the ITMA fair in Birmingham.  Rini, as Valli said i dont have the same enthu as it would have been in India... My Mother-in-law sent me a silk saree and Boomi on his behalf got me a couple of trousers and jumpers...planning to take off friday afternoon to prepare some sweets ....have a party - not the sort that i would love to go....There is a huge Indian community in Leicester and they have fireworks...planning to go and watch it. Boomi's friends are coming down to our home for Diwali...so hoping to have nice time...  I never imagined that Bulb will be such a big kozhi, at the same time prooving that she is a Diana as well! Kicha, we are not certain of how long we'll have to stay...as u said one yr is over...and our visa is getting expired by jan 2004....probably v'll get it extended for another 6 months or so... gud topic for discussion...will pour in my thoughts later!
