Because they are a little off beat, but so well written.  They talk about faith and real life in a way that evokes so much emotion, its rather incredible. Anyway the first one I've been reading for a while.  The second one I just found this morning.  urlLink Real Live Preacher   urlLink Correction   "Friendship, like marriage, like parenthood does more than simply give us a moment's pleasure; it helps remind us who we are."
