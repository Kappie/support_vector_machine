I guess there are others out there who feel as I do. For those who don't, all I can say is, sorry, take no notice,everyone goes through these black moods occasionally. Think happy thoughts, flowers and shit. Why the sudden change of heart, you may wonder. Well, getting your first real payslip from your new job can do that to you. It's weird, having money. Lots of money. I'm sitting here thinking,  and a squeaky little voice intones - "Can money make you happy? Can it really?". But then another , louder, much more obnoxious voice in the back yells" Fuck  yeah! You can buy  all  sorts of crazy shit now, dog! Youse goin  shoppin  come payday, brother, and you is gonna be buyin all dat fly shit you bin wantin! 70cm TV? You betcha sweet ass! Dozens of the heaviest of heavy metal cd's? Aint that the truth, cornbread! Dat Wacraft 3 Collectors Edition box you been moonin about? It's yours, baby! Go crazy, Broadway style!" To those who say money can't buy happiness, I quote : "The best things in life are free But you can give it to birds and bees I want money Yeah, that's what I want."  Party on Garth.
