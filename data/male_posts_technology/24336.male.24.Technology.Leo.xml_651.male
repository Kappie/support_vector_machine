The overall body shape has remained similar to previous Mitsu WRC cars, but the underlying construction, components and technologies are radically different.  

Personally, I am not a fan of the looks of the new car.  I can definitely see how it would be more aerodynamic than the last model, but they needed to make a few sacrifices in the visual appeal area.  There is another small picture of the design available on the  urlLink official WRC site .
