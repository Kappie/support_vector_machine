Dear Angie:  I've missed being your friend.  I'm really sorry that I acted immature whay back when we stopped speaking to each other.  After the thing with the ATM card, you needed someone to support you, and I should have been the one who did.  Unfortunately, I couldn't do that at the time.  I was hurt not necessarily about what you did, but more by the idea that if you needed help with money or anything else, I would have done it for you, but you never asked.  I felt like if you had betrayed one friend by stealing, you might betray me also.  It turns out I betrayed you by attacking you with all the others, without bothering to hear your side of the story.  At that moment, though, I was looking for a reason to stop seeing you.  Actually, I really wanted to get more involved with you, and a couple times I thought you would feel the same, but it never worked out.  For whatever reason you seemed scared to get too involved with me, and I was okay with that for a long, long time, but I had about reached my limit.  When the ATM thing came out, all my frustration about our relationship interfered with my reaction, and instead of offering to help and stay loyal to you, I decided to be mean to you instead to drive you away.  Well, it worked, and I have not heard from you or seen you in about 14 years.   I can't believe all that happenned in 1990.  I have tried to find you over the 'net a few times, but with no success.  I wanted to call you or visit or write to tell you all this, but I can't find you.  Chris thought he knew where you were at one time, but no luck.  So I am stuck posting this here, hoping that by some cosmic accident you find this and read it and contact me.  Bye, Angie, you know I always loved you, whether or not I knew how to show you.   -- R
