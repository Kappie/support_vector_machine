I think the issues are the same and we have two ways of looking at them.  Democrats take issue with healthcare - wanting to provide for others an affordable system, stem cell research so that diseases that vex us may be cured, abortion - wanting a person to have the right to choose, economy - wanting to help people acheive more - and making businesses responsible, education - making the schools more effective, efficient, and accountable to families and students.  You want people to be equally afforded opportunities and allowed to compete for the same resources.   As I'm sure you are well aware, the duality of the political system is split - not because of these issues - but how we would choose to resolve them.  You see, Republicans also take issue with healthcare costs - wanting to provide for others who work or have worked in the past, - not giving people (who don't work) cheap (quality wise)  healthcare at the expense of people who already pay a lot for quality healthcare.  We don't want to water down the system denying ourselves the little we do have at our own expense.  We have seen the ideals of liberals (good in concept) fall apart.  Its good to be forward thinking and idealistic, but not to the point that you handicap the nation in pursuit of grandiose ideas that are only half thought-out.   Stem cell research is fine - if it does not involve harming a fetus or using other unethical practices - its not the research that's the problem - but the means.  Abortion - we generally differ based not on the woman's right - they should have rights - but the baby can not speak for itself - the mother made her choice - as did the father when they chose to have intercourse, in the case of rape - the child should still be born. There are alternatives to raising it if it is a financial hardship. (Other than killing it)   We differ on the economy as we both want to help people achieve more by helping small businesses achieve and giving hiring incentives like tax breaks- when you tax businesses more they tend to lay off employees for higher profit margins - but if you give them tax breaks they create jobs.  This also stimulates the economy by giving employees more money in their pockets to spend on products and services - rendering more tax money to the government through sales - as a choice they make - not being strong armed into higher federal taxes.    Education - making the schools more effective, efficient, and accountable to families and students can also be acheived through vouchers - because by giving people a choice in their education - the schools will be forced to compete and by virtue will become better.  Its like any business or restaurant - if they are forced to compete with competition they have to become better - or they will no longer be in operation and another restaurant or school will come along and take their place.   Democrats want people to be equally afforded opportunities and allowed to compete for the same resources. Both parties have this view.  But we believe in a completely colorblind society - by not considering race as a factor at all and diminishing it as a box to check on all documents; rather than giving anyone any leg up based on their ethnicity. Our party is often referred to as racist by the fringe elements or your party and I think many see us that way.  Most of us say the same of yours based on democrats perpetually keeping people in poverty by keeping them dependant on handouts - and not offering incentive to work harder and make a life for themselves.  Give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day... Teach him to fish and he'll eat for a lifetime.  This is a problem inherent in your your socialist ideology - you assume that everyone will settle for what eveyone else has - in essence average out into a communistic community leaving the few elites to rule and everyone to have all the same stuff. The problem in this is you ignore human's competitive nature as well as the American's keeping up with the Jones's lifestyle (which may not be the best idealogically, but it's what we are all used to.) In essence it smore like you are taking away from everyone to make everyone equal - except for minorities because they get special treatment.  Everyone else must suffer.  This seems to be the most centrist theme in your policies.  The DNC frequently made reference to divisive politics. I see nothing more devisive and dividing to the American public than constantly putting down their leader for standing by his decisions and seeing them through.  I see nothing more devisive than attacking our patriotism and religious views.  I see this far more often on the left.  Our liberties are important - but laws and rules and traditions are important to our values because without standards and guidelines chaos will reign.  The moral relativism is shattering the values of our youth and the perceived "rights" that are really nothing more than expected privelege - are molding future generations into spoiled whiners  - with no historical context and little more than expectation of others to get them by.      On the international level the Democrats want to rely on other nations that at best have proven ineffective - and at worst - untrustworthy - While Conservatives trust ourselves to get the job done and will see our ideals through because we are in it for the long haul and come heck or high water we will acheive our goals regardless of the time or cost. We won't whine that its not getting done fast enough - because we will stick through till the end.  People like Michael Moore would have you believe that kids are dying when in reality they are 18-year-old adults who made the choice to join the militray knowing full well the implications thereof.  He tells you Bush lied when he went by the same intelligence everyone else trusted. We all found the results together - at the same time.  We are all in this together. Bush also won all of the recounts in Florida based on the rules set out before the election. It seems to people that you're party will do anything to win - including acting like the election was stolen, rigged, and making the outher guy out to be a liar - when he is not. The negative politics seem to be coming from one side thus far - and it seems like it is from the left - regardless of how often Kerry espouses the adverse.   When activist judges begin writing laws defying the majority rather than interpreting existing laws - we are in trouble.  When a party will do anything to achieve/stay in power - it is scary. I fear for the state of democracy because of what is being done.  All citizens should have a say in the process, but when the will of the people is disrupted based on the desires of a few amoral - hippocritical whiners who want nothing other than our way of life and values destroyed so they may pervert our nations very foundation and ruin everything we stand for - it's time for something radical to be done.  It's time to get back to our basics, and weed out corruption and spiritual abandon.  It's time to stand up and say NO!  We will not go quietly into the night!  We will not stand by and watch the liberals and media and educational systems pervert our children's perceptions; we will not allow them to ruin our sense of morality or our values and we will NOT stand for pluralism and moral relativism.  If you want to screw up your kids and your own life, may God help you - but the moment you force your unGodly views on me - you have a problem.
