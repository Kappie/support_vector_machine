I am thinking about asking ed if I can temp work down there for the summer. Who knows it might happen.   While we were talking, he told me that Tony was called back to active duty. These were two of the people I cared for most in Lexington while I was there. I don't want to see Tony go back to Iraq. Yeah he may be in the communications area but that doesn't mean that he wont see possible fire fights or even a possible suicide bomber. Some people don't understand that war is hell and that to support people who pursue war as one would a piece of ass is a total travesty.
