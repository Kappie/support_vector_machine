But he had plenty of rants and the opportunity to express them before thousands of Java software developers Tuesday.   What McNealy says is too harsh I suppose. I feel IBM has never envied Java but of course it has its eye on it and why not? IBM has been promoting Java (apart from earning from it) by putting all the efforts. I do not remeber any conference/seminar of IBM which is not focusing on Java technology. IBM also has a vast developer base and a strong urlLink developer community . It has also provided enough resources and licenses to the development community to better work with Java. It has also given leading development tools and app. servers to the industry that otherwise might have not opted for Java based solutions.  Merely asking to Open Source Java is also not the way out. IBM is mistaking here. Java needs a parent but a strong one and of course now, Sun is not THE ONE.  Related Links:  urlLink Where do 3300 employees of Sun Microsystems go?
