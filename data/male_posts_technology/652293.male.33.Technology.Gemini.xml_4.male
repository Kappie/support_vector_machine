One of the clippings this time was an add for the Master of Science (MS) program in Library and Information Science (LIS) at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).  Love those acrymonious acronyms.    urlLink http://www.lis.uiuc.edu/   Apparently UIUC has a distance learning option for the LIS program.  And their LIS program was rated #1 in 1999 by US News.  (They haven't done a review since of LIS programs).  So I looked into it.  It does require some on-campus time, but since campus is only 40 minutes away from here, that isn't a big deal.  I'd get in-state tuition.  I wouldn't have to quit my job (and work may (emphasis on may) pay for some of it).  Claire could still go to school.  And in 5 years Claire and I would both have advanced a level in the school degree sitch.  The LIS program maps somewhat with what I do now.  My friend Dawn who works here has an LIS degree from Indiana University, and it is part of the reson she got the job.  And strangely it will be the same degree that my mom has.  I am not so much interested in working in a Library, per se, but the information science part is interesting.    I began the application process.  I just need to gather a few things.  Essay and whatnot.  I got the University of Oregon to send my letters of recommendation to the LIS program.  On the house side of things... not so good.  The only interest rate we've been able to get so far is 10.25%.  Outrageous!  Mostly because we have a bad credit history.  The last 2 years have been very good, but banks are looking for more like 3-4 years.  There are so many hoops to jump through.  In a way, I don't understand.  We have always made our rent payments on time.  They want you to be living in a single place for 2 years, too.  Strange.  Why would they care, since I am renting?  We keep moving because we find better places to live.  Although, looking back over the last 4 years, we have moved once each year.  Once from AK to OR, then to IL.  And twice since in IL.  Crazy.  That should bring things up to date at this point.  I guess I can still use this blog to track my upcoming education after all.  About which I am quite happy.
