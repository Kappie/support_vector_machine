So i dont find any difficulty in doing that, but then if some one else claims to be like what cheryl demands now, then it surely becomes a problem. Lets try to adopt what he says in our forth coming blogs and as such, lets remove the poem (since its read by everyone) and instead lets provide a link to the original poem in that place!. I dont think, we will be infringing any copy rights if we provide a link to the poem..  BTW ram, y rnt you making much updates to your mentations?  The latest blog which u had posted cliked some words in me, which i recalled today, " If you are busy thinking what others are thinking about you, they are busy thinking, what you are thinking about them". What do you think about these words ya?  In blogrolling section jax, why dont u provide a link to ROASM too, which will help us to navigate quickly b/w blogs.
