The night before we were fighting hordes of green balding undead in Neriak. All was seemingly well and my energies were staying in fine accord. I was beginning to daydream when I noticed all of the party was being swarmed by at least twenty of the evil monstrous hordes. I casted my new complete heal on them one at a time, thinking that Sivius, as strong as Ziggur could last till the end. When I finally got to my companion he was in dire straights. I casted complete heal which takes a while to catch hold. The monster was swinging at him time and time again it was all that I could do not to run up to distract the monster with my own capabilities, yes Sivius needed my heal so I concentrated hard on my powers and prayed to Brell for mercy. He fell then yet my backup healer was on the toes and he rose again within minutes beating the remaining enraged monster with all the might of my previous companions. Just as he was about to fall again. I felt the spell lift off of me and onto the shoulders of Sivius closing his wounds and giving him that spark of life. The beast was slayed within seconds.  There was another night of sheer anxiety and terror in Dulak. I had just gotten my complete healing spell and was with Sivius and Ziggur both who had decided on this night that he would like to meet Sivius to make sure that I was in good hands. Ziggur pulled one of his namesake pulls that we have dubbed the ‘Ziggur Pull.’ With many orcan pirates on his trail he ran to our camping grounds. He reached us only minorly wounded and Sivius ran to pull some of the creatures off of him. I healed them time and time again yet my energy was running low and there were still many monsters to slay.  I begged them to flee however they would not. I pulled out my spell book and quickly remembered the lesser healing spells of my youth and started healing with those. Yet they were not sufficient. With my energy at its lowest Ziggur slew the last monster and cried ‘Break!’  This was a good day for that night Ziggur, Kretais and I were together again and I received my Temperance spell. Ziggur looks mightier now with bigger muscles and new spells that he has learned. I can’t quite place it yet there is something ‘more’ to Ziggur now then there was before. However I will put that out of my mind and simply revel in having them both back in my camp with the new addition of Sivius.  Akcron – Ziggur! Wait for Backup!!!
