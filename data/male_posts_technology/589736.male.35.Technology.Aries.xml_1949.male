I'm in Zagreb, Croatia, where I did a gig last night (this is a pretty jet-setting time for me - I'm in Berlin in a few days).  It was my first time doing a gig to an audience who predominantly spoke English only as a second or third language.  Very interesting.  They were fine with most of the references (Bush, Iraq, Tony Blair, Harry Potter) and highly amused that my surname means 'poo' in the country of my betrothed.  The Bosnia/Croatia war was a no-go area, since Britain and France opposed Croatia's independence (I knew John Major would one day try to ruin a gig for me) and I think they were a little taken aback by my take on Catholicism, but it was a great night and felt really historic.  This is Croatia's first attempt at starting stand-up comedy and it was only their second show.  It's weird - I've never been shown actually doing my act on TV in Britain but in Croatia it took exactly one night.  Today I walked around Zagreb for about 3 hours.  It's a really beautiful city and has pretty much recovered from the war, cosmetically at least (socially, they have that World Bank/IMF thing going on: 5 per cent of the population is filthy rich and 40 per cent are below the poverty line).  Anyway, I've enjoyed being here immensely and thought I'd share.  The home page of the PC in my hotel is a hardcore porn site, which maybe isn't surprising for a Catholic country still in the throes of post-Communist freedom.  Nick
