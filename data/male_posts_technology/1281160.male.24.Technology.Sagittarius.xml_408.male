Madhu is yet to get her offer letter - hard copy or email... and if u wonder how she came to know of her selection despite not receiving any mail or letter from infy... here's the answer.. I told her...!!!!!  I enquired about her selection when she had requested me to do so and informed her of her selection.. she's expected to receive the offer letter by month-end...  and u r asking if I knew this...!! Infy pathi yaaru muuchu vittalum en mela kaathu adikkum...   PS: by kaathu I mean "wind"... ;-))
