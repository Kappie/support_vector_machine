I am now 24, so my parents divorcing so late in my life came to a real shock, it is like the sky not being blue on a clear sunny day.  Both of my parents now are "involved" with someone else. Both situations have there own fantastic stories, however it is not my place to publish either of those stories, it is their business. However I worry for both of them, there is no way for me to truly understand each situation especially when I am now 3000 miles away from home. However it comes as a shock, it seems like they both are moving quickly in their relationships. For reasons I won't discuss here, I am not sure that is so wise!  But who am I kidding.. I am still single, I don't want to be, I feel like I have most of my life left still and I still have the strong urge to find someone else.. quickly. The worst part is I don't, but my parents are better at the field then I am! How humiliating, don't you think?
