I have this buddy, and we'll call him The Mad Shitter (aka Harvester of Sorrow) for the sake of this conversation....so he comes over after the Broncos lay waste to the Raiders (yay! fuck the raiders) to smizzle a bizzle before he goes home...which is fine with me....but here is where shit goes south.  The Mad Shitter indicates that he has to drop the kids off at the pool (who the fuck shits at 11:00 pm??) and with no shame goes into the community restroom while my girlfriend n cousin are sitting there and totally droppes bombs!  He comes out looking guily....I question him: E: dood, did you turn on the fucken fan? D: yeah man. E: you better have left the door closed! D: i did....  I am comfortable with the damage control, so I drop it....... Yeah..... So I wake up this morning, and my cousin tells me that the Mad Shitter fucken shit on the seat!  Now tell me how that is fucken possible????  This guy is 26 years old by the way, so don't go thinking that I get hight with children, and he doesn't know how to control the beast that is his ass!  My cousin had to treat my house like a porta-potty, because this gross-assed, non-aiming, shit slinging muther fucker crapped on my toilet seat!  Mad Shitter......you need to work on that bro....doesn't bode well with the chicks....or doods, or animals, ect....
