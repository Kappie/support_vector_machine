This feature will allow you to edit posted messages directly from the blog. No need to visit blogger.com. This is very useful , if you find you had made some typo or not linked an url.     Ranj, did you receive my reply about your comments on the story?    Ram, what happened to Manny?     I feel that we should promote the blog more. Anyway, Kavitha would be joining us. If any of our friends are on the net most of their time, we can ask them to join also. your thoughts?? I wanted to put a message to the group about this, but first wanted to know your thoughts on the matter.     BTW, if any of you visit a big bookshop like higginbothams or landmark, please ask if they have audio books for sale. Audio books are books recorded as audio cassettes or audio cds, sometimes even as mp3s. If they have any, could you inform me about the average prices?    Just hoping this weekend goes as per expected lines.    Bye,  Jax.
