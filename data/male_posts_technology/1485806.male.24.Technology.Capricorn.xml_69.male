Fetched them and arrived in Bukit Kiara around 6.05am and went around 3 rounds today.Not bad , as i managed to sweat quite a bit and had a good time with wai phing and dewgem.  When i went back after dropping wai nyan and gang at his new house, i found that there is a package for me from Covenant Life Church from US and i thought what on earth have i done till there is a package for me from US. When i opened the package, and then the book Not Even A Hint from Ps Joshua Harris dropped out . I was thanking God and overjoyed..cause i never thought he would response to my email and yet be able to send that package to me in a few days time....  I have read the first chapter and was hungry for more as profound truth and facts are revealed to me.  This is an answer from God from which i have been expecting for the past 1 year plus as I am struggling with the whole area of Lust along with its companion ..masturbation. There i said it , I have been struggling with that alll these while.. Each time i did that, i begin to set a higher standard and poured in my willpower to resist the next urge to masturbate...to relieve myself from the pressure and temptation. Many a times this issue /battle have been confronted with talks, confessions, accountability groups, prayer, and etc...yet it goes again in a cycle. I am becoming more ashamed to come back to God to asked for his forgiveness for breaking thru his standards...but i chose to hang on.  In his book Future Grace, John Piper said we must fight fire with fire. The fire of the lust's pleasures must be fought with the fire of God 's pleasures. If we fight the fire of lust with prohibitions and threats alone - even the terrible warnings of Jesus - we will fail. We must fight it with the massive promise of superior happiness . We must swallow up the flickers of lust's pleasures in the conflagration of holy satisfaction.  Excerpts from the Not even a hint.  To expect victory over lust , we must believe with our whole heart that God is against our lust not because He is opposed to pleasure but He is so committed to it.  He invented pleasure and intimacy of sexual desire but he doesn't want lust to taint all of this and perverts it .  I would continue to immerse myself with the word of God, spending every moment with Him and coming to Him in prayers even i have masturbated.  I would come to Him by faith and not by guilt or feelings..but to believe that He can deliver all of this away.  Right , this are some of the things i have found out from chapter 1 of Not Even A Hint from Joshua Harris.  So Come Back next time to expect more reviews about the chapters in this book.
