If you lose a couple of sessions you are buying in again.   Anyway, not too much to report. I need to have a good session and just walk away. I was up 20$ in 1/2 and pissed that away. Was up $15 this morning in NL and pissed that away. The call I ruined it on was really bad. Had 10's on the flop. High Card. So I bet the pot trying to push people out. The turn was a Q. And the river was a 8, to make my enemies boat. It was really stupid to call this. REALLY! About the only good thing that has happened in the last couple of days is a nice RSF. I will post the hand history but it was easy to play. I flopped 4 to a flush, hit the NUT flush and then made the RSF just to rub it in. Someone said Part gives hats for this. I was on Empire, No Hat! Was I falling for a newbie joke or something?   Anyway, cards are running cold. Getting fed up. I think I might go back to how I built my bankroll in the beginning. Play some easy 5/1$ tourneys and try and jack it up a little. I really hope I can get a nice winning session. Not much. Just a few bucks to feel better.
