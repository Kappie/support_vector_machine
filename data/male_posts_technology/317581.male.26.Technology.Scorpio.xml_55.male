Then you deal with that, and how you deal with that is how you turn out. But really that's just bullshit too, cause you react to everything in a certain way, and that's just one thing you're reacting to.   If I had to choose between knowing everything and knowing nothing, I would most undoubtedly choose to know nothing.   A common dillemma has hit our house, we're out of TP. It's not a big problem, but it means I have to go to Costco, and I can't go to costco until people pay me for bills, which is basically like pulling teeth. Not you Cahlen, the other people in the house:) (and by other people I don't mean kevin or cliff)  We watched "Cowboy Bebop" Disk 1 tonight, which was way fun. I highly recommend the entire 6 disk series of which I only have disk 1 and 5.  Sorry for the depressing poem earlier, I just had to get it out.  The truth of the matter is this, I really do know nothing, but at least I have a good idea:)  I love that I have no idea whether or not anyone is actually reading this thing. This way I can write whatever is on my mind and it'd just there in black and white for all to see, if they wanna look.  g'night
