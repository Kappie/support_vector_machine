Lets see if we can't play catchup:  ----------------  Friends in New York   A while ago Chris and I managed to head up to Upstate New York to visit our friends (Ryan and Jodi) who moved to Ohio.  You may wonder why we would meet friends from Ohio in New York, but it turns out to be about the halfway point between us.   We rented a house on Lake Seneca, and after several adventures, including getting lost, ice storms,  losing power, and spending plenty of time with Jabe (Ryan and Jodi's new baby boy) we returned home safely.    Chris and I went up a day early and stayed at a lovely place called White springs manor in Geneve, NY.   We even had a chance to sneak up (8 hours of sneaking!) to Niagra Falls during a wonderful ice storm.  It was alot like... look the falls.. click... get back in the car its freezing!!    A gallery of my pics are below.

We have the invitations in hand, and now we jsut have to fill them out and send them. We also have dates set for the Jack and Jill party (I belive its August 23rd, but dont quote me i am an idiot with dates).    We have registered at several places.  Crate and Barrel, Linens and Things, Kitchens Etc, and Sears.  All of them have websites, and now.. so do we!  You can always find out what the latest is on our wedding at  urlLink http://www.russandchris.com .  Now we need to get rings, and get cracking on those invites!   -----------------------------------  Poker  I have found a new fascination...  Low Limit Texas Hole 'Em!  It started by watching the World Poker Tour on the Travel Channel.. ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING!!!    I reccommend you see this show, it is really amazing to watch.  Though in professional poker, they play no-limit, so the show is much more exciting.  So now my little group of friends who likes to play poker every so often are trying to master Texas Hold em.  Its a ton of fun, and when wer're not laughing at each other's poker faces, we are actually doing pretty well.   --------------------------  Hilbilly Whack   My last little update is in regards to the game my friend Jay and I have been working on, HIllbilly Whack.   We are getting close.  Finally close enough that I can actually see the work we've done over what is almost a year.  I am not trying to toot my own here.. but i think it will be a ton of fun, and frankly I think we have made somethign in Flash, that really isnt out there at the moment.      And the best part is, the system we made can be re-used to make more adventures for our Hickboy Jones :)    So hang in there folks.. .HBW is deffinitely coming soon.  I estimate we'll slip from the spring we were shooting for, but not by much.  Late May, to mid June, and you'll all see what we've been up to.
