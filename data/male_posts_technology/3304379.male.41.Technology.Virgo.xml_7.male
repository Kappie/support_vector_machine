Normally I would be pissed, but the thought of paying that high auto insurance keeps me calm.  However, right now, I am far from calm.  Got a ticket and a lecture from a pissed off police lady named Alice.  It all started because I was taking my truck that has a broken radio, hence no entertainment.  So, I brought Worf with me, my red headed rooster.    Everything was cool as we traveled down Immokalee rd until we hit some sort of big Everglades bug.  It got caught in the windshield wiper and struggled to get away, but was pressed against the windshield at 60 miles an hour.  Worf, not the sharpest chicken I have, decided he would have a snack, not understanding the finer points of say, a windshield.    He was pecking and flapping his wings right in my field of view trying to get at this bug.  I tried to slap him off of the dash, but he jumped up, got one of his feet stuck in my mouth, the other on my forehead and he made one last hell of an attempt at stretching his head through the steering wheel to the dash to get this bug.    I ran off the road and hit a pile of sand.  My chin hit hard on the steering wheel.  Once I came to my senses, I grabbed Worf to make sure he was alright. He was flapping and clucking like hell.  I tried to calm his nerves, and as the feeling in my mouth came back I started to choke.    That's when officer Alice blinded me with a Q-beam light in my eyes and started yelling at me. I felt something in my throat and instinctively coughed it up.  It came out and hit the officer in the chest.  Worf's toe.  I had bit it off when my chin hit the wheel.  Alice freaked out.  Other cops showed up and drew their guns.  I was frozen, holding my screaming chicken minus a toe, Alice screaming intermittently, I was yelling at the officer and Worf to shut the hell up, when damn if my radio didn't start working.    Highway to hell by AC/DC came on and drowned out everyone's yelling and screaming.  I held Worf and went for the sound knob when the policeman yelled "DON'T MOVE!".  I bet I looked just like the tin man after he got rained on and froze up with rust.  Just eyes moving.  The officer hit my radio, (now it really doesn't work) and he made me get out of the truck.  I would not let go of Worf.  I think they finally figured out I was no harm, especially since the only thing I was wearing was shorts, tanktop, and a chicken minus one toe, and a tin man look.  If officer Alice were a man, I am quite sure she would have beat me like an old woman beats a dirty rug during spring cleaning.  To make a long story short, I got a ticket for driving left of center, and a summons to appear in friggen court for carrying unrestrained livestock.  They threatened to make me leave Worf right there on the side of the road.  That took a lot of convincing otherwise.  I finally picked up Brandon, made him go into Walgreens to get bandages, ointment and such and let him drive while I bandaged up Worf's toe.  Tonight, I will let him sleep in the Lani.  I dug some cut worms for him.  I swear, I don't think he even misses the toe.    I think this chicken played me for a bowl of worms.
