The name Finglas come from the their regional dialect of Irish known as HOW-A-YA Irish. Finglas meaning to Herd Fish with Big Stick.  The Ancient languid of the Fish Herders is well documented around the town of Finglas, painted on the walls of local shops, Bar, Banks and any free walls they can find.. Sadly as the Ancient dialect of How-a-ya Irish is longs since dead the writing are meaningless today. Saying like UP-DA-RAH!, I'S-DID-JASINTA-ERE and may other hold little understanding to unlocking this colourful languid.  Details on the practising of Fish Herding are well know and documented in History. Strangely most References describe these people as, ruffle translated as "THE GOB-SHITES IN THAT TOWN". This Art is only performed by the men and never the women. Once the men reach the appropriate age, which is around the age of 18. They are escorted to the local Pub and then consume 8 pints of larger and a bottle of Whiskey. After this ritual the young Fish Herders are given inflatable shoes, Sheepdog in a bubble and sent out into the Sea the stake their clam on the Fish. They inflate the shoes and head out to the open sea.  Sadly dew to inebriation or lack of balance most never survive the first trip out. This can count for the reason why the Women of the town dress up in low-cut close and heavy amounts of make up and try desperately to mate with any male in the pub, knowing that full well the Men will most like die in this venture. This can still be seen today with women of Finglas warring revealing close, large amounts of make up and drinking heavily in local pubs in attempts to get men to mate.   In closing the life of the fish herder is one of large amounts of drink and one night stands that ultimately lead to your death.. It's a way life that can still be seen today one some from or an other!!
