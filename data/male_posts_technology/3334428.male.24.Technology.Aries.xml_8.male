This past month has not been like that.  I'm learning.  Honesty.  What is the first word or thought that pops in your head when you hear that?  A few different images and thoughts enter my head.  For most of us, you probably fall into 1 of two catgories, comfronter or avoider.  The latter will do everything at all costs to avoid conflict and problems.  The confronter is usually very confrontational and wants to handle the problem right away and get it all out on the table, that's me.  Sometimes I wonder how honest I should be.  There are gray areas. When do you REALLY have the DTR?  Is it 1 date? two dates? 3 dates?  Haha. And we all know this one: "How does this dress look?" Well in all honesty, I don't like it at all.  That would be my first thought if I didn't like the dress.  But should I say it?  Probably not.  Do I say it, yes.    Honesty can be a very positive thing.  There are so many people that go around life with grudges in their hearts about people that have no idea they even have a grudge against them.  Truth and honesty can set you free from that, just confront them, say how you feel, settle things before the sun goes down.  Well it all sounds simple in theory, follow-through is ROUGH.  Sure, being honest and truthful will probably hurt someone's feelings, and possibly hurt your own, but it's what is right.  The times in my life when I have been very honest in truthful have been some of the most rewarding experiences.  I cannot honestly and truthfully say they have been the easiest, but the more rewarding and helpful.  There is something about saying how you feel that liberates you and sets you "free" as the Bible says.   I want to be free.
