How do you tell people you're frustrated with them, when they won't listen?  When they 'have no flaws'?  How do you show them that as much as they don't want to believe it, they do the things they do?  How much of a crime is it, to protect your friends?  How much of a crime is it to possibly sacrafice one for another?  Is it a crime to not want to hurt people?  I will not be sent on guilt trips. This is one situation, that with  everyone  I have to be overly-cautious. I have to be hard and unmoving, unchanging, because I know who I am, and I am not going to be blamed for doing what I thought was right, for feeling what I was feeling. These days, people get   pissed   at you, for speaking your mind. Maybe the conversation was to come? Maybe I was getting to it. None of that matters.  What matters is that I did what I needed to, and there's much more to come. Everyone has flaws, but when you're stuck in between many of them, it builds up. I'm cleaning skeletons out, and I don't know who's staying and who's going. It all depends...  TOIWLGO: Thank you. For allowing me to show someone reality. Mike: I am sorry. That may sound meaningless, but I am.
