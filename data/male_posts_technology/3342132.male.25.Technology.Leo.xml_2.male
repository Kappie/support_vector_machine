Over phone one day, my dear friend  urlLink Karthik  who is an Usabiliy Analyst, suggested that I should start blogging. He had initially insisted that I set up a site. But, maintaining a site is too much overhead. It is much easier to blog which I feel is almost like a scribble pad where you jot down your thoughts as and when they arise. One thing I've really noticed and it may be just me, is that as time goes by the your thoughts/ideas tend to fade away and you start feeling that whatever remains may not be worth jotting down.   Then came across this  urlLink interesting article   by Bob Cringley of PBS. His thoughts are very interesting as to how the Blog is a personal posting and could be used for personal data mining at a later date. That's a very unique way of looking at the art of blogging. It really doesn't matter if the subject you are blogging interests others as long as it captivates you.   It's a personal diary on a public space. So better ensure that are no sensitive or personal details down here. Check out this  urlLink article  about how blogging and RSS can be used in the education space. We are already using a web logging/wiki tool at work for colloborative work and it has been really useful.   The first time is always the most difficult. Hopefully will be blogging more frequently in the future. But, I've always been a sinecure. So, you never know. Let's see how it goes.
