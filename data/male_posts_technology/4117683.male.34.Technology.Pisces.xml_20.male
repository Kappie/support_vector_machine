My mother is just like Erin... Well actually the other way around!  On July 2nd my baby sister was hit by a 72 year old driver that claims that he did not see her. Needless to say my sister had severe brain trama, broke her arm in 3 places, brusied her lung, and other injuries. In the first 72 hours they did not think she was gonna make it... What make it worse for me is that my parents both left to Cali that morning, and I was left alone... I did not get too much info aboiut what Dena was going through, and being alone did not help my depression! Oh yea... My sister was also suppose to get married on the 10th! So that didn't happen!  Well I finally got there, and Dena start making leaps in to recovery the Doctors were amazed! They were calling her the Mircile Girl. That's my sister! :)  Wel.. what else..... Well back to my dead marrage.... what really sucks I really miss having someone to sleep with, not sex, just someone to hold. I miss that human contact. Like when I was in LA at the hospital, one of Dena's friends gave me a nice hug, it took all my strength not to cry, and to let go... I really miss that human contact. I dont even wan sex at this point I just want some that I can hold and talk to... Is that too much to ask!?!? With me.. probally...  I hate this worthless feeling.... Thank god I have a med eval thur. so they may have tp up my welbrurtin dose. I am currently on 150 SR. I also hope that they deal with my possible A.D.D., if I dont have it.. I want to know what the fuck it is cos I know there is deffently something wrong!  Oh yea! I was talking to this woman today while I was waiting at the bus stop. She seems like a cool person. She told me that she is also a devorcee, and her husban cheated on her! With a 17 year old to boot... Now THAT SUCKS! But I gave her one of my cards.. I sure hope she calls or e-mails... I think she lives somewhat close to me, cos we too the same bus and she got off the buss like 5-8 stops before me. He has some beautiful eyes, lt. blue and knida green, from what I saw... and a nice smile... Well I can only hope...  Well whatever... I want to watch crank yankers.. I need to laugh...  shalom!  BTW: Plz sign my guestbook... cos I doubt anyone is gonna read this... So if you can please take a minute or so out of you life, it would make me quasi happy!  Thanx again...  joe
