There were three guys, 20-ish, who looked like they were typecast for President, VP, and Secretary of the (D, Chess, Computer, take your pick) Club - they looked like total nerds (yeah, like I don't!).  Anyway, one of them looked like he was following a girl with his eyes, and later, gets up and follows her into the video-game room.  This girl, also around 20, is simply gorgeous - around 5'3", dark tan to olive skin, some non-white ethnic background, attractive figure, etc.  I thought, how creepy, is he trying to stalk her?  Then I realize she is talking to him, then they start sucking face like the asteroid is coming - get a room, kids, I'm trying to eat here!  My next thought is, wow, she is his girlfriend??!!  How did that happen?  He must have some sort of contract with Satan for that to have happened.    This just proves to me a few things: --that love can occur in the unlikeliest places --that inner beauty can still be appreciated by the physically attractive if they have a good heart --that I can be pretty dumb sometimes assuming I have people figured out when I really don't.
