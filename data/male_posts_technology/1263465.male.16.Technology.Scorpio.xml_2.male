We had to answer all sorts of questions for each question.  And, he made us list 3-5 qualifications of a short story.  Pretty dum, that man.  Then in the second hour we finish the movie.  It's so sad that  urlLink Jenny  dies from AIDs in the end.  I didn't know that... But now I do.  I'm in another battle with  urlLink Joe  and  urlLink DJ Studios .   urlLink This  is the thread that it's all happening in.  I update the animations on the main page, don't know if you noticed...  TOMORROWS THE LAST DAY!!!
