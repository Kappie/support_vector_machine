Only 13 minutes for me to tell the world about the things they need to know. It all started on Thursday night. I went to see Spiderman 2 with a bunch of my uni friends. There were 10 of us. Had a snack at Burger King before entering the cinema. The movie was excellent, seriously. I recommend it highly for anyone who loves action-packed movies. The fight scenes between Spidey and Doc Oct are simply amazing. It seriously takes your breath away. During the movie, I would find myself holding my breath till the end of one of the many amazing fight scenes. Fantastic! Go watch it!  Oh no! It's 8.51! Another 9 minutes to go! Have to continue. Then, on Friday evening, went to the Wilayah Mosque to attend my cousin's  akad nikah . It was quite a big affair, actually. The  akad nikah  took place after the  Asar  prayer. It went smoothly enough. Although the groom had to say his line twice before it was given the thumbs-up! Met up with some of my long lost relatives. It was good to see them. My cousins mostly. The mosque itself is huge. Actually, it would be an understatement to say that, because the mosque is extremely huge! It was a chore just to walk from one end to the other. Besides that, the insides of the mosque is beautiful. Don't take my word for it. You ought to go and check it out yourself.   The wedding reception was on the following day, Saturday. Now, that was a grand affair. I enjoyed myself there. The reason being, I met lots of cousins and nieces whom I haven't seen in ages. They looked good. Very mature looking. Very very mature looking. Well anyway, we had to rush through that one since my parents had to attend their friend's birthday party. I was invited as well, although I didn't feel like going since it'll be full of old people and kids. No many people my age will be there. But since I had nothing better to do, I followed. It was in Ulu Langat. Quite far, by my standards. We were late, but luckily we came just before they were about to sing the birthday song. So, after the song, we had something to eat (yet again!), and I was introduced to a very charming tourist guide which they met while they were on holiday in Sabah.  We started talking, but once they started the karaoke session, she invited me to go to someplace quiet where we can talk in peace. So, we went to the dining room which was on the first floor. But still the noise from downstairs managed to be heard. So we had to sort of shout to listen to each other. She turned out to be very adventurous and very independent. I'm glad I went to the birthday party. At least I made a new aquaintance. :) What time is it now? Oh goodness! It's 8.59 am! They'll be here any minute now! I don't think I have much time to continue with today's blog. I hope you have understood what I wanted to convey to you.    This is the last few seconds, but I need to tell you what the significant of Bladerunner is to today's blog. Well, I have just gotten a Sun server named  SunBlade 1500 . And I named it  Bladerunner . Oh no! They are here. I can see the door to my room opening slowly. I can see one of their heads peering into the room looking for me. I have no choice but to submit to them. Because if it weren't for me asking them out for breakfast this morning, they wouldn't have come looking for me now. Well, ladies and gentleman. I bid you farewell for now, for I have a breakfast appointment with my colleagues.
