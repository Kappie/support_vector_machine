I listened to what I had and I just didn't like it.  I hate being a perfectionist sometimes because it messes with my schedule which I am 2 weeks behind now.  The weather outside the studio was just scrumptious yesterday.  With the remains of Tropical Storm Bonnie we had about and inch and a half of rain in under an hour.  Driving was fun.  Lately I've been looking at picking up another instrument.  Right now I'll call it the mystery instrument.  I don't want to spoil the surprise when everyone is finally able to see it.  I hoping a couple of months I'll be able to order the thing.  Now I bet you won't be able to sleep for months while waiting in suspense.
