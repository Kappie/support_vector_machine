But I did anyways. I wasn't good, hopefully by the end of 3 weeks, i would know to tread. My free style is pretty good, thats what my good-looking (;-))instructor said!:) hehe. Fun to be back in learning mode. i might go to swimming today. we dropped anna at airport yesterday and saw Kurien. He is getting married on July 10th. It was good to catch up with him. Worked whole of last night and slept thro the morning. busy, busy, busy...
