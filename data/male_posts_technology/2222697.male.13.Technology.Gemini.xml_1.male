I havent seen any of that game beacuse i cant afford it. You pay 50 bucks for the game and you have to scrape another 13 off every month to keep your account. And being 12 doesnt bring in any money. And the other video i got was a mix between 8 and 9 and had evanesence in the background (which is a nice touch). The video's will be availible on my site when i feel like it. I'm kicking myself for not finishing the video you may have to wait and dont rush me. I havent gotten any more pictures and my site wont make itself. It will be up before i die. Ok back to the movies i d/l-ed. I now understand why people call final fantasy 8's story "a make you cry story" even though is is just Rinoa letting go of a butterfly and there is that awesome evanesence in the background and us anime geeks are light-hearted.  It makes me envy squall because....well he...has...her. Geez my love life is horrible. (but programmers are lonely) BYE!!!
