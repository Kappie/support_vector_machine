Here are my reviews of the movies.    urlLink  The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King   I guess I need not give a gist of the story. The movie warrants a detailed post. I'll put it later.    urlLink  The Hunted   In the green woods of Silver Falls, Oregon, Aaron Hallam, a trained assassin AWOL from the Special Forces, keeps his own brand of wildlife vigil. After brutally slaying four deer hunters in the area, FBI Special Agent Abby Durrell turns to L.T. Bonham-- the one man who may be able to stop him. At first L.T. resists the mission. Snug in retirement, he's closed off to his past, the years he spent in the Special Forces training soldiers to become skilled murderers. But when he realizes that these recent slayings are the work of a man he trained, he feels obligated to stop him. Accepting the assignment under the condition that he works alone, L.T. enters the woods, unarmed--plagued by memories of his best student and riddled with guilt for not responding to Aaron's tortured letters to him as he began to slip over the edge of sanity. Furious as he is with his former mentor for ignoring his pleas for help, Aaron knows that he and L.T. share a tragic bond that is unbreakable. And, even as they go into their final combat against each other, neither can say with certainty who is the hunted and who is the hunter.   My comments :  It was wonderful. Can watch it more than once. This movie reminds me of David Morrell's works. It was ironic, reading a novel and watching a movie that were so similar.     urlLink  Confidence  : A con man gets into big trouble when unknowingly tries to scam an accountant that works for a mafia kingpin. Now, he has to pull off yet another scam to pay the mafia off before they get tired and decide to "collect their losses." Confidence is one of those heist films with plenty of twists, a lot of characters who are guaranteed to back stab at least once and flashy direction to put everything together. It is quite clear that by the end of the movie.   My comments :  It was interesting, humorous and twisting. Can watch it once or twice (if you like the dialogues).     urlLink  The Identity  :  Caught in a savage rainstorm, ten travelers are forced to seek refuge at a strange desert motel. They soon realize they've found anything but shelter. There is a killer among them and, one by one, they are murdered. As the storm rages on and the dead begin to outnumber the living, one thing becomes clear: Each of them was drawn to the motel, not by accident or circumstance, but by forces beyond imagination, forces that promise anyone who survives a mind-bending and terrifying destiny...   My comments :  It was a nice thrilling horror movie. Can watch it once.     Ennaku 20 Unnakku 18 : I guess this film does not need any story line.    My comments :  Yet another copy of Serendipity. The only best thing about the movie was the music. There were mistakes galore in the movie as expected from a Tamil film.     Janasheen : The newspapers seemd to say the movie was good. So this was my first Hindi movie for quite sometime. I don't know what the title means. Maybe someone can elucidate on it.    My comments :  It was a typical Hindi masala film. The usual baddies, songs in foreign locations, fights ad romances and infuriating makeup and dresses. THe one thing I liked in the movie was the bike race. It was filmed beautifully. I don't know if it was an archived footage or it was shot for the movie.
