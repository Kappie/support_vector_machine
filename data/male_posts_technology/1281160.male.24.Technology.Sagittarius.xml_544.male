Hi All,  As rini and jax are not able to access groups, I have communicated with jax, and have taken the following action on their behalf...  Membership Type :  Restricted (you approve all requests for membership)   and raghu_boddu@hotmail.com is removed..  I'm Cc'ing this to the great boddu.. to let him know he'll not be able to receive the mails sent to msitmmb anymore... or send anything...!!  Kicha
