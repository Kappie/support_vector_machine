My views on that are in. In the meantime, the powers that be at the label have given the album a big thumbs up after hearing the bulk of it.  Now the business begins, so it's emails and phone calls the bulk of the day. OXIDIZER is now slated for either the third or fourth week in October. There is initial discussion about a track appearing on a compilation, though that's not confirmed. It might possibly end up being the machine porn epic SCORNOCOPIA or the in your face rollercoaster rocker PULSE (aka WHITE ROOM BLACK NOISE though we're not sure which title to use yet).   I've asked Ash to get involved on an aggression remix for Chemlab, not just because I know he would do something incredible, but because I'd love to see Ash get his hands dirty in the machine world for a bit. I need to get him hooked back to a computer and away from guitars just for a bit.  Defcon Gilez (my pal and promoter of our UK extravaganza in 01) informs me the band he manages, Needleye, are remixing the aggression and could have something in a few weeks. These guys are hard and nasty. They are hurrying to wrap it up because have just drafted in a producer of some noteriety, also a friend of mine (and well known to industrial fans around the world and known especially to my advisor/lawyer/agent), to produce their new demo. I can't say who though!  I'm a man of many secrets, sorry. the only reason I get to hear this stuff (and keep my day job) is because I'm good at keep it secret.   It's no secret that Cerati is tomorrow night!  F
