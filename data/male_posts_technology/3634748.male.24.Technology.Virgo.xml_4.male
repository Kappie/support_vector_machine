Bouncing between gut-wrenching stuff and hilarity, with plenty of snideness thrown in, Moore's message came through loud and clear, in a well-produced package.  Secondly, love it or hate it, I think this country needs to thank Michael for having the guts to do this.  Some links:  urlLink Fahrenheit/911  [imdb.com]  urlLink Michael Moore's homepage   urlLink Christopher Hitchens attacks the film   urlLink Jason Godesky debates Hitchen's criticism point-for-point   Is it biased?  Obviously.  Does it leave important things out?  Yeah.  Is it misleading?  Partially.  Does it lie?  Actually, no.  There's a fair share of out-of-context cut-and-paste type stuff going on.  Some facts are very carefully worded.  But the truth is, Dubbya and his administration went well beyond fact-spinning and selective memory.  They, the government supposedly of, for, and by the people, lied to us.  Told us in plain language things they knew not to be true.  And take into account the amount of fact-checking that went into this film.  Selective facts yes, and you might disagree with Moore's commentary and opinions, but the questions he asks are apt and deserve to be asked.  Actually, I think Fahrenheit 9/11 should be one part in a series.  We've got our election theft / corruption / unjustified war film; we should also have one on the two-faced gutting of education, the disgraceful mess that's been made of the economy and the job market.  There could  be a trilogy of scathing documentaries dealing with the rotten things Dubbya has done to our country.  But I digress.  The film's been called propaganda, which I suppose it is.  Let's not fool ourselves, though.  Propaganda in favor of Bush and his war is everywhere.  Anyone who thinks the media in this country is "liberal" or even unbiased is living in either isolation or denial.  We've been hearing Dubbya's side of things for years, almost exclusively.  I am not a terrorist for questioning authority.  Folks in the 1950's were not communists for questioning authority.  Where there are hidden agendas, no matter how well-hidden, there will be people who smell a rat.  It's a sad day in the "free world" when so many people (good people, honest people!  But misled people) won't admit that there's a rat even when someone follows their nose, catches it, and displays it for all to see.  It's an effect of having it washed over us again and again and again.  Bouncing terror alert levels, duct tape and plastic mixed with messages to go out and fly to Disneyland and live freely.  "We're invading because of weapons of mass... erm... we found Hussein, which was our goal!"  Mixed messages scare and confuse people.  Who has brought more fear and mistrust to this country, the Taliban or our own government?  Obviously, attacking innocent Americans was a travesty.  Obviously terrorists are dangerous.  But leveraging that into social control and stripping away civil rights, that should be every bit as obviously evil.  Sending our young into harm's way so that the rich can get richer is not acceptable.  Whether you're a die-hard republican, bleeding-heart democrat, or someone with no special party affiliation, you owe it to yourself as a conscientious citizen of the United States of America to watch Fahrenheit 9/11.  See it in a theatre, wait for the DVD, copy it over the internet, it doesn't matter.  Just see it.  Preferably before you vote this November.  ;^)  You don't need to change your mind about anything if you don't want to.  If there's even a hint of openness in your mind, the film will get you thinking.  Even if your thoughts are mostly along the lines of "that can't be true, I'm going to research that", the film has still done its job.  You've got to think about this stuff, even if it's angering or depressing.  It's important.  This is our country too; it doesn't just belong to the rich and powerful.
