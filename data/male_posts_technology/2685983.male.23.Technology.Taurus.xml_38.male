I was surprised at how well it worked. Watt just sat in the chair plucking away and Kira was up bouncing around the stage. About half the songs are instrumental and Kira sings on the others. They played two 45 minute sets and there was no opening band. The crowd was an unfortunately small group of local hipsters and jazzfest patrons.  Watt was selling his book  urlLink Spiels of a Minuteman . I got a signed copy for $10. He didn't bring enough to go around for the fans. I also got my  Double Nickels on The Dime  CD liner signed and got a picture with Watt and Kira.  After the show I had another beer at Curtis' place and played the excellent Wario Wares on Gamecube. I passed out there.  Today me and Curtis went looking at yard sales. Didn't find much but I did go to one that was held by some kids that post on  urlLink threeohsix.org  and I got a The Rentals CD, a Beavis  Butthead video, a NOFX LP, and Tank Girl on DVD all for $9.50.  So now I have nothing to do for about 3 hours and then  urlLink Asterid  is practicing at 6:30. After that Todd is having a BBQ at his house and I'll be going to Manitoba (the band, not the province) at The Odeon.
