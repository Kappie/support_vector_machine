It will start as a story, but will eventually become true.  I can't wait to find my Norton.  He will rule.  The whole idea is so absurd.  I can't wait to make it happen.  Need a back hoe.  3) worked out my legs.  Wife hates my butt.  Says it is too small. Concentrating on making my butt bigger.  My butt hurts.  Maybe find butt padding.  4) Dude was working on the workout machines today.  He had a belly that would impress my friends in SC.  Easy a 12 pack a day belly.  If he locked his truck keys inside, there is no way he would get in the back window with that belly.  I watched him while I did abs.  I hope mine is that big one day.  5) Promised my wife a website and a rose garden.  Gotta do the website first so I can afford the rose garden.  6) met geek girl today.  She is nice.  7) Gotta finish this project.  When done, me and my new Nun transplanted liver are going to do some damage to my wine cellar.
