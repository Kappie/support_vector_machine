Look at it this way:  That $1.50 buys almost 100 tons of ancient plants, ecologist Jeffrey Dukes says in this month’s Climatic Change.  Today’s oil fields formed as microscopic plants living in ancient seas died and sank, then were buried deeply enough for heat and pressure to cook the organic matter into oil.  At each step, much of the original material decayed or escaped.  Dukes, then at the University of Utah, used published figures to calculate that every day, humanity burns up oil equivalent to nearly a year’s worth of plant growth across the entire planet."
