The line to get a picture with the Stanley Cup was about 45 minutes long, but Ethan did great. The good news / bad news was that to keep the line moving, you were pretty rushed when your shot came. Regardless, it was pretty cool having my son there, and him showing some enthusiam for this truly impressive trophy.   Of course, he was really hyped about the games that were setup there for the kids. One had kids playing goalie with the full complement of pads, mask, glove, blocker, and stick. They had a machine shooting ten or so pucks at each kid. Ethan loved it -- he even caught a puck with his glove. They also had a deal where the kids could shoot balls at a big goalie poster. Anyway, if I can figure out how to post pics here, I'll do that.   Oh yeah -- T-minus two weeks and counting ... and counting ... and counting ...
