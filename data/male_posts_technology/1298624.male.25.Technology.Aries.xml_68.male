They tinker and install new "upgrades" that supposedly make work better, but in the end, the server with that critical application that everyone has to have up and running, 24/7, 365 freakin days a year, will eventually fail. Ha! and fail it did these past few weeks. In some weird way, this makes me happy.  Donuts and work. How synonymous are these two things? I'd say pretty damn synonymous if you ask me. Jesus, is synonymous even spelled correctly? Everyone loves eating donuts at the office. Every friday, it never fails. One of the three higher-ups would bring in one to two boxes of donuts (depending on how frugal they are) and the hard workers consume them with a lust unseen by the animal world. It's always a race to get the donut that you love to eat before it's snatched by that unsuspecting co-worker...WHO KNOWS that NOBODY loves that particular donut as much as you do!   Not that I eat donuts all the time. I don't. But when you get a hankering for one and find out that your favorite was just stolen from its nest only seconds after you finished up that phone call, you gotta be mad at somebody!  *sigh* Donuts. The proverbial bane of human existence. Donuts will be the catalyst of America's downfall. Aaaack...don't go into conspiracy theories. I hate assumption...why should I think of something that could happen right? Waste of time if you ask me.   UT2k3 has taken most of my night's time for now. It's rather entertaining to play a game that literally plays two to three times as fast as your brain processes information. Maybe it's because I'm getting old? I don't know. All I know is that I see things that were in one place and HALF a second later, they are someplace else....SHOOTING ME!!!!! I mean, come on! What the hell is that?!  *cough* Goddamn cough.
