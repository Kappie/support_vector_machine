Inside one finds the premium salad of their choice (I picked fiesta), a 16.9 oz bottle of Dasani water and the 'prize' in the form of a 'Stepometer' and the 'Step with It!' walking program created by Oprah's trainer Bob Greene.   Now while I'm not a big fan of McDonald's I did want to support them as they encourage folks to eat better and I really, really wanted the Stepometer which was oddly enough copyrighted by Coca-Cola.   They also have a nice website up to help people start walking and keep walking @  urlLink http://www.goactive.com/  plus Bob Greene's site  urlLink http://www.getwiththeprogram.org/ .   I signed up for the President's Fitness Challenge @  urlLink http://www.presidentschallenge.org/index.aspx so I can track my progress and also to win a patch   I'm such a lemming at times..  --- Sent via Email
