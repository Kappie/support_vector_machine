Lots and lots of ministry opportunities, all with ethnic groups from the 10/40 window.  Very cool. Had a final team meeting tonight to go over the details. The very last thing this summer is a big missions party on 8/21. Whew.  I'm tired already... Lots of good opportunities this summer so far and I'm sure NYC will have plenty more.
