Now he is losing his own memories and time as he views  the dreaded future. Man, it was good. But it looks like a two parter. The next one will be  the followup of this one. Can't wait to see it.   Quantum Leap on DVD ! I couldn't believe it. The first season of Quantum Leap starring Scott Bakula and Dean Stockwell is now on DVD. Man, I grew up with this show! I have added  it on my list of interest. Now I am torned which to buy, the second season of The Dead Zone or the 1st season of Quantum Leap. grrr. Too many DVD's are coming out. A guy doesnt have enough money to keep up with them. I stil haven't bought any Farscape DVD's either and loved that show. Those are too expensive for me. But Quantum Leap and Deadzone, I can probably muster up for. :  )  Never heard of Quantum Leap? The Scifi  urlLink link is here .  You can check it out.
