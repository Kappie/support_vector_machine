Gwen and I just conversed (how or why... it doesn't matter anymore) and in the course of our brief conversation, she told me a name: Richard. I guessed and got it right; her new boyfriend.  I think it's time to blow the dust off the old stack of emo music and wallow for a while.  "This goes out to the one I love..."  ok, while's up...  *sniff*
