Well, not the people dying bit, but the walking around in shorts and a t-shirt bit and going to the beach and seeing beautiful babes in abundance.    So today I will call and quit my fido job and accept the job I was offered last week.  I don't know if it's the right decision or not, but hey...life begins when you jump off the cliff, right?  I've been reacting miserably for so long career wise that it's time to get my booty bouncing and take control of the situation.  So I may be taking a pay cut for a couple weeks, but at my low pay that's not all that painful anyways.  For the amount I was working at the job i'm quitting, I only need to sell 2 pieces a month to make it up...that's not so bad or difficult.    I haven't been getting my one post per night here lately...for whatever reason I think of cool things to write all day while i'm out and about and then I get home and I blank.  So I've got to get that creative ball rolling again as well.  There's a point one reaches when you're doing something creative (be it music, writing, art, whatever) where a burst of clarity hits and things make sense.  Problems can be solved and stress can be relieved, and it is that same feeling that one should strive for at all times in your life.  My whole point in writing this blog was to have an outlet to access that, to reach that point quickly and consistently and maintain it for long enough to ease the stresses of everyday life.  Hmmm...Perhaps I've been having trouble because I spend too much time trying to think of witty and intelligent things to write and not thinking about the free association flow that I originally meant this to be.    This issue gets back to my post about success and uberness and the part about having a vision and then maintaining it.  I seem to have lost some of the vision I had for this little endeavour, and I need to regain that now.  Which is, I guess, what I am doing in this particular post.  Now to keep this vision consistent and ongoing.  That's the hard part.  I don't know why I worry about what I write or how it's written; it's not like ANYBODY reads this stuff except me... and yet I do worry about it, and the result of that is that I lose the path.  Well, I'm gonna strive to not do that any more.  /me puts his foot down!  Back to the heat...time for me to put on my shorts and go out and find some foodage.  Maybe i'll see some pretty girls half naked too... don't tell my girlfriend...
