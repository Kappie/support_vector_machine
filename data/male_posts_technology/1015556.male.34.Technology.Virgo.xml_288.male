Images of my children just kept popping into my head, and the screaming desire to have them be passionate about Jesus just weighed heavy on my heart.  I'm not usually such an emotional person, I have no idea why.  It was weird.  I had to play this song over and over, probably 10 times in a row.  Weird.  But therapeutic.  Angels Words and Music by Marty Sampson   The holiest place there could ever be All you can do is bow Before the one who made heaven and earth Before the Almighty God For him alone  Sing with the angels Sing with the angels Singing the name of the lord Singing the name of the lord  For every soul  He gave it all Given for all of mankind Eternal life is his alone Given to all who believe  In him alone  Jesus
