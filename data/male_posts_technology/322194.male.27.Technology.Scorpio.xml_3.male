It's not just the art itself that creates this excellent comic, it's also the juxtaposition of music (via truncated downloadable MP3s) that combined together with the visual comic style create an almost movie-like experience. It's unique, all-encompassing, and fantastic. And it can only be done on the internet.  It's made the Evil Network Comics listing now! Great stuff!
