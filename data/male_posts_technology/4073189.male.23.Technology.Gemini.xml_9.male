Bored to death as I was counting the number of hours left~   Released from camp:   1735hrs    State of Condition:   Demoralized   On the way back home, I bought Mee Hon Kuey with Fried Chicken cutlet to boost up my morale… Yum~!! Watched DVD while I eat my dinner… It’s my usual habit to de-stress.After watching the DVD, I started to design CD-Covers for an Encoding job.  1400hrs: Finished what I supposed to do today. Updated Organizer and prepare to write a Blog~ Then Zzzz…zzzz…   ORD countdown:   76days    Why is there a timer for my ORD? NS is a waste of time…And I serve 16mths with a rank of CPL…
