The weather man said it was supposed to rain all weekend yet the little man and I showed our pale bods about every two hours as we walked to the beach for a dip.    The little man surprised me a good one too. I knew he liked to swim, however I didn’t know he was suicidal. He has taken a liking to jumping off of rafts and boats. He has also learned to like his Spidey life jacket. Suicidal is fine with the appropriate life saving devices.    Another big concern for us was quarters; you know it those round silver 25 cent pieces of valued coins. Not only are they there to clean your laundry, yet they can also be used for showers. Fifty cents is about 2 mins. I now take a 3 minute shower. Oh yeah, I'm good.However those coins are the new gold. If I wasn’t the one going around begging for the damn things I would be the one selling 50 cents in quarters for 5 dollars. Bet I’d get it too. Zack, on the other hand, has grown to hate water falling out of the sky. He thinks the sky is falling, or the oceans raining down or any other paranoid version of Henny Penny he can think up. He really trips a big one. Raging toddler tantrums from hell, face red through minor sun burn and flaling arms and legs. The showers are cut off of the rest of the bathroom by a curtain. With both of us butt-naked he ran through the curtain and headed for the door, our only towel in his hand. He opens up the door and runs out. Here’s flaming mom, flashing the camp, soaking wet, running after screaming, streaking two year old. Oh yeah, most embarrassing moment, *raises hand* I have the best one.    NEWAYS – Those are the highlights of our trip. I also have been sleeping since I got back. I’m hoping to do some Ever Cracking tonight. Miss that smash and bash.    Akcron – Ziggur! Wait for Backup!
