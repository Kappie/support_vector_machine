I came down with some serious sinus issues on Friday morning, I was all clogged up and no humidity was present to get it out.       The two finest hotels/casinos in Vegas are  The Venetian  and the  Paris , they are absolutely beautiful.  The best club would have to have been Coyote Ugly inside the  New York, New York  that place was happening.  My wife will be happy to know that I did not see any bare breasts, no showgirls guys sorry.  All in all I am very glad to be home and 2 to 3 days in Vegas is enough for me, especially without my wifey.  Oh and I got sick there did I mention that?  So yeah I fell like poooo!  Ain't life grand!
