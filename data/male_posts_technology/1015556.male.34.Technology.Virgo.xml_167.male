Just amazing to see and hear them worship so whole heartedly.  Went over some really good stuff missions wise - unreached people, state of missions today, Gen 12, etc.  The feedback I got was that a lot of them hadn't heard stuff like that ever before.  My goal accomplished.  Had some good team times too and we got them a great start to writing support letters - the notion of finding partners to their missions trip.  I feel a great sense of pride at a job well done.  Not only me, but having God lead in such a way, and, more importantly, that God would grab these hearts to be passionate to bring His glory to the nations for the rest of their lives.
