The aging progressive rock band who have been around since the dawn of time and who tour relentlessly to the enjoyment of their faithful fan base. It seems like only yesterday that we saw them in San Jose. Come to think of it, it was almost yesterday. April if I recall correctly.  So, Yes is coming back to the Bay Area on Sept. 17 at the Concord Pavilion. Great. We'll get tickets. Now, if you've ever purchased tickets online, you usually deal with either Ticketmaster or Tickets.com (the old Bass Tickets outfit). Neither is a great experience. The Ticketmaster website works for the most part, even when they're being bombarded by people buying tickets. Tickets.com less so, but still not that bad. With either, you end up paying the "convenience fee" which seems more like extortion. I've never had problems with Ticketmaster or Tickets.com although I always grumble about how much the "convenience fees" are.  Now Yes, being the type of band that is so devoted to their faithful fans, have partnered with an outfit called FanFire to sell special ticket packages for the latest Yes tour. Kennedy and I are interested in the lowest cost package, regally named the Bronze package. Each ticket is around $90. Kind of expensive but hey, we're fans. The other packages include other stuff like t-shirts and something about being able to meet the band in person. Of course, the prices are out of this world too. Sorry, but the thought of meeting the band while surrounded by some of the more scary hardcore Yes fans is something I will pass on. Watching overweight 40-ish women wearing spandex pants and t-shirts airbrushed with pictures of the band hitting on Chris Squire scares me. The image of Squire in spandex alone is enough.  So, the tickets went on sale today at 11am sharp. I figured that the site will be slow since everyone will be trying to buy their tickets online at the same time. What I didn't figure is that it would be really slow. Painfully slow. So slow that it timed out to an error page TWICE during my transaction. The second time, when it was trying to process the credit card information. On top of that wonderful experience, you are not allowed to select how many tickets you want to buy. You're allowed to buy two and only two at a time. Kind of sucks if you want to buy three tickets. Now here's the kicker. At no time during the entire process do you find out where your seats are. We could be in row 6. We could be in row 30, but we won't know until the tickets are delivered and in my hands. You buy them and if you don't like the seat location for whatever reason, tough luck. There's always eBay.  In an age where online commerce is so commonplace, it's amazing to me that there are still outfits doing business online that emulate what it was like in 1997. FanFire must have their website running on a Pentium II running Windows95 ,with an ISDN line.  Here's a thought: try using modern servers and provide ample bandwidth so that customers don't bust a gut trying to buy something on your woeful system.  I never thought I would ever say this, but I appreciate Ticketmaster now.
