       
      purposed as a quick means of escape used as a permanent escape from reality most of my time spent in another world daydreaming  realities get too complicated and can often be unsatisfying too often  there are no questions in daydreaming that go unanswered the hero always slays the dragon  CONTROL  gears shifted, paths traveled by a thought send in one direction as opposed to another does he find purpose? does he get the boy? in reality no one knows and since my reality is offers no answers with my daydreams i cure my woes  ...but i'm tired of getting through life in dreams
