Nor, having once been, does he ever cease to be. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, undying and primeval. He is not slain when the body is slain. "  Anything which has birth has death . The first and foremost rule set by Him. But the soul never takes a birth or dies. He is eternal, ever-existing, and primeval--that is, there is no trace in history of his coming into being.The soul is part and parcel of Him.   There is no endurance of the changing body. That the body is changing every moment by the actions and reactions of the different cells is admitted by modern medical science; and thus growth and old age are taking place in the body. But the spirit soul exists permanently, remaining the same despite all changes of the body and the mind. That is the difference between matter and spirit. By nature, the body is ever changing, and the soul is eternal.    Why we try to control the world ?   As, we all are disengaged part and parcel of Him, we have all the qualtities of Him. As He is the supreme controller,we also try to control the world. There is a conscious in us. This consciousness of the soul is, however, different from the consciousness of the Supreme because the supreme consciousness is all-knowledge--past, present and future. The consciousness of the individual soul is prone to be forgetful. Because of this forgetfulness, we do all sorts of things in order to rule. So, He made a system of Karma, that one has to pay here in this world for one's deeds. A killer has to be killed. If we remember that we are not the rulers then the problem of violence faced by this world will not be there.  He has created this world, so He has all the rights to own it, rule it, not us.  If we try to conquer and upset the nature's balance which he has created, only we'll suffer.  He doesn't play, He gave us a perfect place to live but its us, who spoil this nature and kill ouselves. He tries to guide us but if we don't listen, we pay for it.
