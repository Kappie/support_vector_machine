The only track I remember was a Rage Against The Machine track right at the credits. Daft. Also what the fuck is Persphone doing, i mean I know she's Monica Belchionia or whatever, but she's just T  A and there's a time and a place for that but not in the glorious cinematic geek-fest that is the Matrix. Trinity should have popped a cap in her skinny butt for mashing tonsils with Neo. What a harlot!  Anyway.. Kerrie sent me this..  TWO TOUGH QUESTIONS     Question 1: If you knew a woman who was pregnant, who had 8 kids already,three who were deaf, two who were blind, one mentally retarded, and she had syphilis, would you recommend that she have an abortion?   Read the next question before looking at the answer for this one.     Question 2: It is time to elect a new world leader, and only your vote counts. Here are the facts about the three leading candidates.       Candidate A - Associates with crooked politicians, and consults with astrologists. He's had two Mistresses. He also chain smokes and drinks 8 to 10 martinis a day. Candidate B - He was kicked out of office twice, sleeps until noon, used opium in college and drinks a quart of whiskey every evening. Candidate C - He is a decorated war hero. He's a vegetarian, doesn't smoke, drinks an occasional beer and never cheated on his wife.     Which of these candidates would be your choice?   Decide first, no peeking, then scroll down for the answer.       Candidate A is Franklin D. Roosevelt. Candidate B is Winston Churchill. Candidate C is Adolph Hitler.     And, by the way, the answer to the abortion question: If you said yes, you just killed Beethoven.
