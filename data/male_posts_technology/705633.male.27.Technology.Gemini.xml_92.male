You think your getting a decent ride whilst on it but afterwards you feel ripped off and unsatisfied. Everyone says how great it is you’re on it until its gone... There may be plenty of other ones around but everyone will slag you down if you try riding a new one when the old still has the contract. and finally the ride wont take you where you want to go and even if it does, not frequent enough.  Oh and be careful of the bubble gum on the seat.
