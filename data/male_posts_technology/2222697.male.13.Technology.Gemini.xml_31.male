But actually there were enough rebels to make it all worth while. We (meaning me, steven, brandon, and harry etc.) wrote down all the good songs for him to play. When he actually plays them, we start jumping up and down like jackasses and one of us usually gets slammed in the head. This time namely me. One guy from 8th grade threw a guy right in to the right side of my face, i fly 20 ft backwards. It hurt. But it got better. And then we did our usual we hate rap chant    when    he    played    rap. Really? does anyone ever listen to rap voluntarily? Then we did normal stuff until he played bohemian rapsody. That was fun. There were a mess of outcasts in the front. In the begining there is a slow part....then i gets good but after the slow part he switched the song. About 30 people ran up there and yelled at the dj. He steps back and hesitates to make a move. He was scared to death. then from the floor he changed it back and the goodness continued..     I am going to start my autobiography "My childhood sucked". I will give you the link later because i havent started. And i wont really  be done until i graduate. I will update it frequently.
