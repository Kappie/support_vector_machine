Im not an exebitionist, but last night was funny, all the double takes. I just wish that I had my camera. Why do I have this curse of all my camera’s getting stolen from me. The latest was taken from me by  urlLink Princess Kate and the wonderful Andy.  Please can I have it back? I will give you copies? On the same note, Andy is great as well, continuing on the Canadian girls theme. Not only does she drink proper drinks, sorry PK but wine is something you drink over dinner ;) Add to that a hand bag which could (and probably does) contain the entire population of a medium sized African state. Hope you enjoyed your stay in Jersey, We did.  Brett, I didn’t mention you in my last post because, as I said at the time, I was drunk. I also didn’t mention the big T’s stalker and the fact that she bit a pound of flesh out of custards neck in a vain (get it… Vein, Neck...) attempt to make toaster jealous. Oh, and Im a better zombie that you. Now I have to shave the rest of my head to match the bald side. And finally  urlLink something to keep Psycho amused .
