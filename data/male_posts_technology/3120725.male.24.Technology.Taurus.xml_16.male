My education system would ignite a new renaissance period, my healthcare system would increase the average lifespan 20 years. The people would be happy and over time the would become complacent. That is when they would see the true nature of a man with absolute power. I would crush their spirits and bend them to my will, fear and terror would rule. Sleep would be hard to find among the screams of the damned. Then after they could take no more they would rise up like a cornered lion, fighting with every last breath. People who hated each other would find common ground in their desire to crush me. That's when I decided maybe I should not rule the world, I will set my sights lower to a less violent species.  -AverageCypress Lord and Savior to the Hamsters
