We had our weigh-in, and measuring (car has to fit inside a  box  thats 7inches long, and no wider the the car with it's wheels on).  We got all our cars checked in by the 6pm dead-line. We handed out the participation patches to all the kids as they were certified, just to make it easier.  I arrived at 5pm, to start unloading the track from the car, and getting stuff carried in.  The track is extreamly easy to setup. We purchased a 35ft 2 lane aluiminum track from  http://www.besttrack.com .  All I had to do was to put the pieces of track together, pushing in the ends of the metal dowell pins into the other piece of track, and clip it together with some binder clips.  We had the track together, with our electronic time keeper hooked up, was maybe 20 minutes.  I gave it a quick wipe down, and then we were ready!  We started out with our Flag Ceremony, and some opening announcements.  I got to hang our 2004 National Quality Unit Award streamer on our Pack Flag, and we handed out the patches to all the scouts to put on their uniforms.  We also handed out some patches for our Webelos Overnighter last fall (we ordered the new patches, which came out in 2004, and was our first chance to give them out).    I also had some achievements for my Webelos II Scouts as well. Then it was time to start the races!  While we were doing our awards, we also had our 2 judges looking at the cars, to pick a  Best Design  and  Most Unusual  from each den, and those cars would get trophy's.  We had 25 Scouts racing this year! Always a good turn out for Pinewood derby!  We had no issues, no squables, bickering, or arguing! It was awesome. No cars malfunctioned.  It was probably the best Pinewood Derby we've had while I've been a leader.  The cars were great, there were some excellent races (Including * 2 * re-races, as we had to have the cars flip sides and go again, because they tied!).   All-in-all, it was just an awesome evening.  Z*lda made up 2 kerchiefs for the winners, out of a checkered flag material. These went to our 1st and 2nd place winners, and they get to wear those kerchiefs to districts where they represent our pack, and to our last 2 pack meetings.  Our oldest who is a Webelos II won a trophy for Best Design for his den.  Both boys want to take their cars to district to show, to have a chance for a trophy there.  Our youngest got one last year for Most Unusual Design.      All I can say, is that I really get into doing the Pinewood Derby races, and it just gets funner and funner every year.  I'm going to help out the local Boys and Girls Club's Pack a hand, and take our track down Tuesday to help out with their races as well.   Might be helping out another pack as well, they have to contact me yet.    Cant tell I had a great time can you?  It's a very energetic evening, and it tends to last for a little while :-) Can't wait for next year, to do it again! :-)
