I live in Africa. So it's no surprise then that I find very little sympathy among the locals for 9/11. Many people have attitudes akin to 'So what, thousands in Africa die every day to starvation'. Frankly, attitudes like that disgust me. How someone can watch the footage of the towers falling and not feel any sympathy for those who died that day, is beyond me. That many will denounce the loss of life as minor or inconsequential, ignoring the acts of incredible heroism carried out by the firemen who gave their lives to try and save the lives of others, disturbs me severely. Yes, people die every day. Yes, Africans are dying in the thousands because of famine. The difference is that those Africans dying daily are not being  murdered . It's a natural disaster. It's terrible, but it is the whim of God, Fate, whatever. Sep 11, on the other hand, was the whim of one insane man. That one man could cause the death of so many innocent civilians in a single day, is tragic. Not since the Holocaust and Hiroshima/Nagasaki has there been such a massive loss of human life caused by a single individual. That some are so ignorant that they can't  see  that, is disheartening to say the least.  In the wake of Sep 11 discussions, debate on  urlLink Prophecy  shifted to the Iraq situation, and the Bush/Blair intention of possibly pursuing military action against Saddam. Once again, many people dismiss it as frivolous, unnecessarry, hell even biased. It's time people woke up and smelled the nuclear weapons that Saddam is building. http://www.iraqwatch.org is an interesting site with some unnerving facts about Iraq and it's drive to develop nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. India, Pakistan, China, Korea, they all have nukes, is it so unimaginable that Iraq might soon have nukes too? And as Saddam has evidenced in Kuwait less than a decade ago, he is more than willing to use military might to try and seize land. Are people so quick to forget what insane Muslim fundamentalists are capable of? Has 9/11 already been forgotten? If Osama had a nuke, he would have used it. Saddam is fast approaching the stage where he can give Osama a suitcase bomb. Everyone knows the 2 are big buddies, hating 'the West' equally - some reports even point to Saddam having a hand in financing Al-Quaeda. Getting a suitcase nuke into the US will not prove impossible. If not by air, then merely by boat, or across the Mexico/US or Canada/US border.   Personally, I'd rather see the Iraq / Middle East conflict resolved now, with conventional weapons, than wait another 6 years and see a US city obliterated in a nuclear strike. Because I'm pretty sure the US would be willing to drop The Bomb again in such a scenario, and personally, I do not find the prospect of living in a world embroiled in nuclear war at all appealing. Even if I live out here in Africa.
