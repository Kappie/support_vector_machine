The guy screws up his marriage and it made me think about making sure, everyday, that mine is tip top. If I'm honest there are areas that we are just getting by in - so I need to resolve to sort them out now before they are a problem. In the film they both keep diaries so I thought I should blog tonight.   Weekend was hectic but great fun. Not that long ago k and I had to work on spending time with other people as a couple. This weekend we never ate alone, except breakfast. K, P and I went for a very breif trip on the river saturday durring a gap in the weather. K stripped off and went for a swim, I love her so much.   Tonight we went out for dinner. It was a lovely evening, the first in weeks, so we ate at the Bridge and sat outside, next to the  urlLink river .
