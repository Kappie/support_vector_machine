Today was a great mail day. I opened up the box and found three envelopes of nearly equal size and aoversized circular with ads from various local retailers. I found out I can have carpet installed tomorrow and a sunroom added on by next Saturday! Why do they send these ads to people in apartments? To taunt us, that's why.  On to the envelopes. I typically sort my mail in order of least credible to most credible and then from most relevant to least relevant.  So usually the bills are the most credible and most relevant. Not my choice but society seems to think that's the way it should be. Anything mortgage related that's not from my mortgage company goes to the bottom of the heap and is generally ignored all together.  Today's heapstarted with a confirmation notice from the post office. We recently moved and put a forward order in so we continue to receive the rest of the heap. Next was an envelope that wasn't marked indicating its business in my mailbox. I opened it and found it may have belonged at the bottom of the heap. It turns out that if I scratched the five boxes on the card inside that I could win a 13 inch TV, a DVD player, or $750 in cash! Would you believe my luck that I scratched and won $750? Me either. But if you check your mailbox you probably did too. I read the fine print just enough to confirm it was bogus. I think it was some sort of time share sales gimmick. I remember seeing something about 90 minute sales seminar. Must have been time share.  The last envelope, and the most disappointing, was from  urlLink The American Poets Society . Several weeks ago I came across their web site while doing a search for something else. While there I submitted a silly free verse  urlLink poem  I wrote shortly after I bought my first laptop. In the envelope was a letter saying they wanted to publish my poem in their next anthology which is due to go to press in the next six weeks. I was pretty excited. So I read a little more. It sounded legitimate but it seemed like they wanted me to buy a copy of the anthology while confirming the text was correct and that I was indeed the author. The more I thought about it the more I questioned how real it was.  I did some searching on Google and found a couple of pages that made me decide to just toss the thing in the shredder.  What a disappointment to think for one moment that I was being published and the next to discover it was all a scam! Of course, I can't complain much... I didn't lose any money in the deal.   urlLink http://www.complaints.com/directory/2004/june/9/14.htm    urlLink http://www.complaints.com/directory/2004/june/4/24.htm    urlLink http://www.eliteskills.com/writing_scams/victimview/55
