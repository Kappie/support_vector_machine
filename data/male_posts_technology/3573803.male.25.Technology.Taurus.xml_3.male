Although for some this weekly amount would suffice even for a month, we decided that we were going to live like kings and have absolutely no regrets about it!! While doing our accounts yesterday we realized we had gone beyond our budget. Which is quite surprising since we did not go for anything extravagant, just basic stuff that two guys would need to survive (such as 24 pack of almond snickers, a box or orioles, a box of choc chip cookies, caramel...). Yup.....jus the bare necessities...to keep us from dying of hunger.  Got to go eat now.....Sayonara.
