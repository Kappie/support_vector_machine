And by  break into  I mean write something that will somehow be published by someone.   I really don't know where to begin, and I don't think  urlLink AIBO  will be any help sniffing out a solution to this problem.   I'm crippled by what I consider my lack of a portfolio. The anemic bundle of bleached tree fibers amounts to two real articles, two real editorials and about 15 satirial  urlLink Onion -esqe articles and assorted commentary from my days as a newsie at the  urlLink Gonzaga Bulletin . Oh yeah, all the real articles were for the  urlLink Cheney Free Press --dunno if that'll work for or against me.   My big idea was to start small, stick with my roots. Living in Seattle I have access to shitloads more concerts than my fellow Americans in Spokane. Any act that rolls through Spokane more or less has time on their hands between the Emerald City and Boise or Missoula. SO, I write an article PREVIEWING concerts coming to Spokane based on watching a given band in Seattle. The best chance of landing this gig, I think, is through an independent spokane area rag (see:  urlLink The Inlander ,  urlLink The Local Planet ). Newspaper concert reviews are fundamentally flawed because they always appear after the fact. " Best concert ever huh? Tight, I'll have to catch them when they roll through again in 5 or 10 years."    My system, obviously, would fix that. I've already pitched this idea to some chick at the Inlander whom a friend (also working at the inlander) put me in touch with. The email went unreplied to. That was months ago, back when I kinda liked my job and wasn't actively think of ways to leave it and be self-sufficient. Things, like people, change. It's not me, it's you.    So I'm going after the idea again, but this time I want ammunition above and beyond what I've done in the past. I'm going to write an article  unasked-for , dazzle them, and I'm in. Unfortunately the only band coming to Spokane in the near future that isn't Loverboy or this guy is Pedro the Lion.  Fortunately , I really like Pedro the Lion and I'd jump at the chance to go to their concert anyway. Win win. One snag: the closest they get to Seattle before hitting Spokane is Vancouver, the  night before . The plan isn't nearly as well thought out as I'd hoped.   Back to the drawing board . . . If there is an easier or better way, someone let me know.   Update: Looks like David Byrne is coming to town. I'm seeing him in Seattle a night later but I saw him in Spokane at the Fox a few years ago and talked to him a little so maybe that'll work. . .
