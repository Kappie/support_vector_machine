I couldn't sleep because I'm not used to trying to that early, and close to 11:45 I got up to get a drink. She arrived home, accused me of disobeying her (what the he... such a huge offence...) and then accused me of lying to her when I tried to convince her otherwise. Whatever... I just went back to bed and forgot about it, but then the next night she was out again, and sometime around 9:50 my dad was like, "Why aren't you in bed?" I just kinda  stared blankly at him and was like "wha...?!?" I learned that apparently as a punishment for not being in bed 'on time' on Monday I was supposed to go to be at the hideous time of 9:30 on Tuesday. My mom thought that my dad had told me and my dad had thought that my mom had. It gets even better though... My stupid stupid mom didn't care that it was infact my dad's fault, she decided to punish me for the 'offence'  again  on Wednesday by making me go to bed again at 9:30.  Now on Wed. I don't normally even get home untill past 6:30 and yesterday, my dad had to run a couple errands so I didn't get home untill past 7. I flat out told her that I wouldn't have enough time no matter how she sliced it and that I was not going to go to bed at 9:30. Oh, by the way, we're having a blood drive today at school and I signed up for it assuming my parents would be perfectly fine with it. I mentioned it to my dad, who didn't care, and again to my mom when I got home, right before I told her that I wasn't going to be able to get to bed on time. She mentioned that she had some concern about me being constantly fatigued and that it might make it worse if I were to give blood, but then had to run out the door to catch a movie with some friends.  I called her sometime after 9:30 to address the concerns that she had because I was getting ready for bed, but she steered the conversation to why I wasn't already in bed, not some health issues she might have with me donating blood. I was really hurt by that because it says to me that she cares more about her rules that she impetuously lays down than for me, her son's health. We ended up in an argument which consisted of me almost pleading with her to hear me out, but finally after she cut me off the umpteenth time and said no, I hung up on her. I know, I know, that was a bad thing to do and I already appologized to her. Regaining my composure in a matter of seconds, I kept from crying and went upstairs to my dad's room and right as I knocked on his door, my mom called him. She started telling him her side of the story and before I could get a word in edge-wise, he started doing to her what she had just before been doing to me: abruptly steering the conversation to another topic and blaming it all on her. He started on his whole partyline about how she was a horrible wife and mother and she should be home helping us kids with homework and such (btw, she pours countless hours into doing stuff like that, he just never takes the time to think through his name-calling, yelling tantrums) Anyway, he ended up hanging up on her too, but for a much different reason than I did.   Now would be a good time to clarify that my family's disfunctional.   Anyway, this morning I talked to my mom for a good twenty minutes about the blood donation thing, and she still is stubbornly sticking to punishing me for something that I didn't do and then wasn't informed that I 'did' by not letting me help save a life. Brilliant mom, just brilliant.
