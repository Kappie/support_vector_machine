I think it is time to put the HTML skills and Control C + Control V skills to use.   How does the new layout look? Took me a lot of time and hand coding with ^C  ^V.   A few technical details about the layout: Fluid design. Uses CSS. The content will automatically resize to fit into the window size. Try changing the size of the browser window and look at the content.  Will get back later,  Jax.
