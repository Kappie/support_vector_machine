I have queued up my playlist so I don't have to keep fumbling for the mp3 player each time I wanted some thing to play. Though white town has been running through my mind all day.   Started to put together my new liger x zero last night got too tired to finish it. I just hope the dogs don't decide to eat some of the parts.  some thing strange happened the other day. I feel asleep for about 20mins on the couch and when I woke up my left eye didn't want to focus. At first it was like both eyes didn't focus for the first 15-20 seconds, but that is normal, but when the right eye focused and the left one didn't I started to Blink and stuff to make it clear out just in case some thing was wrong with it. But none of that worked. This lasted for about 2 hours. I am thinking in need to go see the eye doctors some time next week.        It's calling, from somewhere within my breast I want to always dream of dreams that make my heart dance Though the sadness is countless I'm sure that beyond it, I can see you  With each mistake they repeat, people Understand the blueness of the plain blue sky Though the road may seem to continue without end These hands of mine can embrace the light  The silent heart when the time comes for parting The body, which will return to nothing, listens closely The mystery of living, and the mystery of dying Is the same for all, even the flowers, the wind, and the streets  It's calling, from somewhere within my breast Let's draw our dreams, countlessly forever Rather than saying all there is to say about sadness Let's use those same lips to sing softly  Listen to the whisper I don't want to forget Within the closing memories Even in a mirror shattered to bits The new scenery will be reflected  The quiet window at the start of morning Let the body, which will return to nothing, be satisfied I won't search any longer beyond the sea Something shining will always be by me Because I've found it within myself
