My utter lack of talent and therefore success?   Bad Luck?   A general jealousy towards my good looks - resulting in spiteful employers?   Lack of drive?   Poor spending choices? (Front row tix for DMB 5 years in a row!! HI LUF! :)   oh well  I'm now accepting donations. Contact me.   "Save the Africans from Certain HIV" Fund (Aka the help get Capital One off my f'ing Jock Fund)
