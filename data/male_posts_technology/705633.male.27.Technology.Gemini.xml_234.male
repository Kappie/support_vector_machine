I have just been reading the 'Shut It' website and I have to say that I kind of got a bit pissed off at myself! The thing is that I would have loved to of gone out with the lads on the piss last night, had a laugh, met Princess Kate and generally had a crack. Unfortunitly my work hours at the moment are really pants and theres nowt I can do about that (says with a quivering bottom lip). Well I am going to be working winter hours now so hopefully I'll be coming out very soon haha!  Anyway, a big hello to Princess Kate, if she reads this, hopefully we will meet at some point. Oh and a big hello to Liane and Andy whom I had a cool chat with last night. Hope 'Baity's Spaff Wagon' ain't too boring, we will all have to live with cameras in our pockets and get some cool snaps ok guys!! Baity signing off......
