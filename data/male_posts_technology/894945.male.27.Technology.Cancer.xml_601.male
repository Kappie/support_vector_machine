Anyway, another weekend has passed us by, leaving sore heads and empty pockets in it's wake. This particular weekend however, has been action packed which makes a change from the proverbial norm!  So what exactly did happen this weekend??? Here's how it went.....  Friday 14th...  Our good friend Bobby H got married at the Hotel L'horizon, which was very very nice. I got to experience some of the best deserts known to mankind (hhmmmmmmmm dark chocolate). It all went superbly, without any hitches, which is always a result, and we even got to observe that strange dancing style known as 'Wedding Jive'. This particular style involves all the participants to dance in a totally disoriented fashion to each other and mock strip, in fact if I had of know all the people there, I may well have performed the special 'Baity Strip' that only some of my old friends from JCG will have seen before!!! Anyway, it was a great wedding and the fun didn't stop there.....  Custard and myself left the Hotel L'horizon and went into town around 00.15ish and went to Chambers to see a friend. I wasn't very happy to have to go into chambers as it is no secret that I dislike going out in town- too many townies!!! (Big up the Splash!) However, I was totally stunned when we got into Chambers and heard the familiar bass line to Metallica's 'Enter Sandman'! At first I believed that my mind was imagining the heavy guitar riffs as some result of exhilaration from the deserts I had consumed earlier but I was greatly heartened when I found out that a friends band, known as 'Take This' was playing that night! We stayed in Chambers until it closed and a good fun was had by all in the small hours.  Hmmm...that concludes Friday then........  Saturday 15th...  Saturday started off in quite a strange way! I woke up around 08.30am and in my semi half pissed from the night before phase, I walked from Custard's place in town to my cousins house up by Vic college to watch rugby, only realizing that I was meant to go watch rugby the next day, not Saturday!!!  So I then walked back into town and went back to sleep! Later that day I went shooting and shot some new guns- an A14 rifle and a Garrand. It was the really good session and I actually hit most of my marks. I think I may have to invest in my own gun soon as I always use my cousins at the club.  After shooting I went home to prepare for the nights festivities...  So Saturday night arrived and the Toaster crew celebrated Toaster's 24th birthday! We all went for a meal at the 'Blue Fish' restaurant and proceeded to drink the night away! I even fell in love with one of the waitresses hehe.  After the meal, Gristy drove us all up to the pub in St.Peter's where we continued our merriment, although there was a band playing that was covering a few 'Coldplay' songs that made us a bit depressed until they finished.   Lastly we all went down to the Splash and finished the night to some reasonable music, although Toaster buggered off home early, I guess there is no law against being a party pooper at your own party!  Yup, that's Saturday done.....  Sunday 16th...  Got up and went to my cousins to watch the rugby- England v France. It was a bit of a struggle in the first half but England prevailed as I thought they would and now I can't wait until next Saturday- England v Australia!!! I am confident that we will win but I am not placing any bets.  After the rugby, Richard (one of my cousins) and I went for lunch with our friend Andy (one of the guys we went to Santa Pod with) at St.Mary Country Inn, which put on some very nice food! The aim of doing lunch was to prepare for a short film that Andy was making, Richard being one of the important roles and myself being in charge of the pyrotechnics haha!  So once all the scrummy food was devoured, we headed off to shoot some scenes for the short film named 'Dreamtime' or it's alternative name 'Midnight Pussy' (the latter name being a somewhat misleading joke name). I will hopefully be putting some promotional clips up on the site soon, along with photo stills and possibly a little piece form Andy as director, producer, etc etc all in one!  Then in the evening I went to Simon 'Shrek' Surcouf's to chill, and so ended the weekend.....  So now it's Monday and I have to say that it has been a weird day too. It is one of those days that goes quickly yet when you reflect on the day it seems to have been utterly soul knackering! Yup..that's an average Monday for you!!! Oh well I guess I will now go and sort out something to do this evening......  OOOOHHHHH!!!! Lord Of The Rings- The Two Towers extended version is released for sale tomorrow, much spaffage!!!  Baity signing off.....
