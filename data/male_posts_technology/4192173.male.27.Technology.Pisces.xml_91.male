Sadly, the special guest couldn't make it as his mother was making him a going away dinner (note: hes not living here on this side of the planet any more). However, plans have been made to give him loops and such and he WILL appear on this record. And we need him. He's talented, classy and foreign.  So this left Brandt and I to our own devices and the first thing we did was listen to the rough tracks of the inital drum sessions. I'm happy to say the test run was a success and Robinowitz is well on her way. I have some new ideas on how to push her buttons creatively, and we should be implementing those ideas as well. I have referenced recent Gustavo Cerati live show bootlegs as our benchmark for drum/electronic combos.  So B, knowing in advance I was interested in beginning some vox, had the mic and gear set up. It took till 3 am, but I laid down some scratch vox for THE MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE, SOLAR and what is still called TWO BASSES. This was more to see where my voice is at these days and to see if the melodies and lyrics I had this far for the album worked. Well, Brandt seemed happy with the melodies and lyrics, and hes a fucker when it comes to this stuff, so I think we're at a good point. I'm also happy my voice has gotten stronger with age, or maybe I just know how to use it better. Brandt says I'm hitting 70% of my notes, which for me is a miracle this early in the game.   What will happen now is that I will listen to mp3's of the tracks with vox for a few weeks before cutting the next round of vox. Thats usually when I hit my 95% (the rest is technology at play). But it's off to a good start, and I'm also ready to work out ONENINEFIVESIX and CREATION PHASE as soon as I'm back in the studio.  Happy to report the long awaited REVENGE 2CD set finally arrived yesterday and godDAMN was it worth the wait. I've been living a lie for 12 years as it turns out the entire previously released tracks from their second EP GUN WORLD PORN were all in fact edits and the original versions appear here for the first time ever. Brandt and I almost shit our pants hearing the full version of STATE OF SHOCK (a lost classic). So much of Hook's bass was cut out. Whoever was responsible for that should be killed. Immediately. Anyway, this disc is the best.  I'm enjoying some time at home with Irene and hoping to get into the new Primal Scream bio should I grab a few free moments. Hopefully it's good.  I'm sure we will be discussing Chemlab soon as the album is just starting to get to the kids who pre-ordered. The reactions will be curious.  For the die hards: I have corresponded more with Mark Mohtashemi this week than I have in the past 8 years. I'll let you speculate.  blog blog.  F
