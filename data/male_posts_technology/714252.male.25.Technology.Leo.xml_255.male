Having trouble coming to terms with some things but I don't think that it's a bad thing and I know it'll be ok soon enough.. Just need to get used to it.. (Cryptic eh.. I wonder how many people are going to ask me if I am talking about them..)  I think I finaly have a plan of action with regards to work.. I see a light at the end of the tunnel and I even know how to get there.. It's actually all thanks to a surprising source.. Lets just hope it doesn't all fall through on me in a gust of bluster..  Salsa site is all in place now, so I just need to start getting you lot to actually start using the site.. If you are even VAGUELY into salsa PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE spend some time putting stuff into the different sections.. Put in links to all your favourite salsa sites.. Put in your favourite salsa combos in the articles section, put in links to pages with video clips in the downloads sections. Put in listings for any clubs I may have missed.. ANYTHING!! I want to launch the site but want to have a little bit more in there before I start telling people about it!!  K, I gots to dash..  Love you bye, bye.
