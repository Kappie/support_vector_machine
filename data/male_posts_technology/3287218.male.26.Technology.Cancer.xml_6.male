I still have my apartment, my cable internet, and my family.  Well...maybe not a lot has happened.  2 weekends ago my cousin graduated from Lancaster Mennonite School in Lancaster, PA.  I was able to attend and then go to a friends and family party in the afternoon.  That was fun.  Last friday, I finally took Belle in for a visit to the Vet.  She is now 6mo old and weighs 14 lb.  She is still hairy and cute as ever.  I also scheduled her for a spay.  She had that done today and I almost cried when I left the Vet's office.  My brother and I picked her up at 6:30 and on the way home she got sick and make some messes in my car.  When I left my house, she was very very docile and hasnt eaten anything since Saturday or Sunday.  I tried to give her some food, but she didnt take it.  Oh well...she will bounce back.  Thats all for right now.
