There's even a little history lesson from the old days of the 'net when NetScape was the supreme being.  Ahh, the "good 'ole" days when you had basically two choices for a web browser (Netscape and Mosaic), when Microsoft products were a pain to get connected, and AOL had no plans to mess around with this goofy thing called "The Internet". ;)
