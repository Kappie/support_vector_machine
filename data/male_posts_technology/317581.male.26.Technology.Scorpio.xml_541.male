It's basically what signs the scorpio find compatible and what not:  "You have an all-or-nothing approach to relationships, therefore you do not match up to all the signs. Here's a look at how you do interact with others.   SCORPIO  ARIES: - You make a hot combination in bed. Highly aggressive sex that could be described as implied violence. Lustful but not lasting due to your jealous nature.   SCORPIO  TAURUS: - Polar opposites that actually do quite well together. The Bull is stable and loyal enough to satisfy your intense nature. You both value long-term unions and are willing to work at them together.   SCORPIO  GEMINI: - This is not a likely match, the Illusive, fickle Gemini will drive you to distraction, which in turn could bring out your vengeful side.   SCORPIO  CANCER: - This is one of your best connections. The Crab is a loyal mate who is usually willing to stand behind you. Cancers are attracted to your strong, demanding ways.   SCORPIO  LEO: - This connection can lead to crimes of passion. Although you are strongly attracted to the Lion, Leo's flamboyant, flirtatious nature will cause anger that could erupt into murder-suicide.   SCORPIO  VIRGO: - The Virgoan has difficulties with your sexual leanings. You will bore easily and move on to more passionate partners.   SCORPIO  LIBRA: - This is not the best match. Libra is far too good looking and easy going for your jealous nature. You would likely end up spying on this social butterfly.   SCORPIO  SCORPIO: - Sexually you are truly compatible, however out of the bedroom you are far too much alike -- creating problems and mind games. You will always think that the other is having an affair.   SCORPIO  SAGITTARIUS: - This alliance is a waste of time for both parties. You are a homebody and the Archer is a travel nut. This is not a likely attraction.   SCORPIO  CAPRICORN: - This is a wonderful partnership. You both have the same values and cherish your home environment. Mentally and physically you match up well, easily satisfying one anothers needs.   SCORPIO  AQUARIUS: - Why bother. This will never work due to the Aquarian's need for freedom and your need to possess. Your values, ethics and approach to life are just too different.   SCORPIO  PISCES: - This is not bad. Probably the most erotic sexual combination. The Fish is willing to be a part of your whims and desires, and that makes for a lasting union.  "
