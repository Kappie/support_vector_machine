So there I was, sitting at my desk putting some finishing touches on a report I was writing in FoxPro (yeah, *cringe*), and I think to myself "Self, this needs to be compiled and tested. - You are absolutly right self!" So I begin to compile the program which contains the report, the one which I had mentioned earlier. Things go fine, then a couple errors crop up that keep me from proceeding. You see, this isn't all together strange, we work in a multi-user environment so all of our code is stored in a source control, usually when this happens it just means you maybe havent added, removed or updated some files; no problem.  (If you watch closely this is the part where my morning becomes... not so happy and fuzzy and stuff... as if it were before. Well, it was, to some extent, a bit more on the cheerfull side... but I digress.)  So I was deleting a couple files and I guess I just got on a delete spree for some reason and clicked on the report I had just written (I am currently blaming the fingers but the fingers keep pointing in other directions). As I looked this file dead in the eyes (or... whatever form of ocular organ a file may have) my finger swiftly and deliberately pounced upon the delete key. Immediately I realized what I had done when the confirmation dialog box popped up.   "Do you want to: [Remove] [Delete] [Cancel] ?" it enquired.  "Interesting choices, though I really don't want to delete this file. This is the one I have been working on." I said to myself as I clicked directly on the button marked "[Delete]".  The dialog box left in much the fashion that it appeared. I could feel my brow do a summersault and land in a half furrow, half questioning position. My eyes blinked of their own accord for a moment and then my hand joined in the fun and smacked both of them just for the hell of it, it made sure to include my nose just to make sure my mouth would be upset. Obviously it was quite upset, as it immediately let go of my jaw and muttered a few curse words.  Needless to say I will be spending the rest of the morning rewriting that report and hoping I do not delete it a second time.     -intX    Bottles and cans, just clap your hands
