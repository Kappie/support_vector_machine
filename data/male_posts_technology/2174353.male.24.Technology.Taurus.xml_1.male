A person applying for immigration to the UK, Australia or Canada is required to appear in IELTS General Module. The test consists of four sections: Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking. There are 10 bands from 0 (being lowest) to 9 (being highest). Usually a score of 7 is considered quite satisfactory.  From Sep 2003, the test fee has been fixed at Rs. 7000/-. The scores of the test are valid for 2 years and you must have a gap of 3 months before re-appearing.   Test Sections:   For speaking part, an interview of about 15 minutes is held. For listening part, you usually hear an audio cassette and have to answer the questions on your answer sheet as you go. The reading part has 3 passages (one of them being quite complex) followed by comprehension questions. The writing part has two tasks (an explanation of a graph and a short essay). The duration for listening, reading and writing sections is 1 hour each.  Speaking and Listening are same for both General and Academic Modules. General Module is easier than Academic Module when it comes to reading and writing.   Preparation:   The test is not very hard; however, it's not as simple as TOEFL. The best method is to self study for reading and listening (and writing too, to some extent). You can purchase Cambridge IELTS Preparation books from Urdu bazaar (for a sum of Rs. 180/-). It comes as a set of 3 books with 4 audio cassettes and covers a lot of ground. For speaking, however, you will need to do practice. In my experience, most of the people find difficulty in this area and it's best to get hold of a friend and start practicing with him [You know that already. Don't you? Why don't you start it from today? Believe me, it will give lots of tension at the end].   In case you are not getting enough time to study independently (or you are lazy in these matters like me), it's better to get admission in a training institutes. There are many and you should attend a class before joining the institute. I would recommend  urlLink The Princeton Review  at Clifton (near Abdullah Shah Ghazi). Back in Sep 2003, they were charging Rs. 4000/- for a one month crash course. Each week, there were three classes and there was one day for full-length test. My only issue with them is that they didn't let us practice speaking part much. Their address follows:  The Princeton Review F-37, 26th Street, Block 4 Clifton, Karachi Tel: 5824726-27 Fax: 5824725  [For those, who don't live in Clifton: with Abdullah Shah Ghazi on your right hand, go straight; cross the round about and walk for a minute; you will find the place on your right hand.]  Beware that IELTS tests your ability to understand and communicate in English - a skill that you have acquired throughout your schooling. By practicing for the test, you can only raise your score by a band of 1 or 2 (which isn't insignificant and it's worth practicing as much as you can).   Applying for the Test:   The test is given by both  urlLink British Council  and Australian Education Office. I am not sure if there is any difference between the two (there shouldn't be any; however, there are rumors that AEO is easier while British Council is preferred by universities and immigration authoritites). The test fee is Rs. 7000/- (as on Sep 2003) and you should plan ahead because there is a lot of rush during admission days. The details below apply to British Council:  You can get the application form from Standard  Chartered Bank, Metropole Branch (near Marriott). Pay the fee; you will be given two copies of the payment slip. Take the form with you; fill it in (don't forget to write a valid email address); attach two photographs, a copy of your ID Card and Passport as well as the Examination Services copy of the fee slip and submit the application pack either at Standard  Chartered or send it via courier to British Council [in that latter case, keep the copy of courier slip with you].  The address of British Council follows:  British Council PO Box 10410 Karachi, Pakistan  Tel: +92 (21) 111 424 424 Fax: +92 (21) 111 425 425 info@britishcouncil.org.pk   You will be informed about your test dates via email. That's why don't give an address on which you are getting too much spam. You will also receive a formal letter and instructions for test a week before your test date. I had applied n Aug 2003 and got an email within a week. The test date given to me was 11th Oct. I received a formal letter on 1st Oct, announcing the test dates to be 6th Oct for Speaking part and 11th Oct for the rest of three tests.    Sample Speaking Test:   General Introduction: -> Introduce yourself -> Why are you interested in computer science? -> What do you intend to specialize in?  Trend Questions: -> Do you like shopping?
