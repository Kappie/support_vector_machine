I am only a tenth of the way into the book right now (pg 150 /~1300pg) It is a very interesting book. So far it is about a future where man's philosophy is that everything should only be done for the good of those that are not as fortunate. To be more concise it is corrupt to produce for your own gain and value only comes from the sacrifice of your own wealth and ability to benefit those who do not have it. This is not the point of the book, the point of the book as far as I can see so far is to show exactly the opposite.  Now for the quote. I have been thinking on my own for some time along the same lines as the quote above. I do agree with the quote, mostly. However, I think that there is one level higher of depravity. That is: If a man has a purpose but does not take any action toward fulfilling that purpose, then this is the most depraved type of human being.    Perhaps I am splitting hairs and that the original quote implies this. However, just because someone has a purpose does not mean they will choose to attempt to fulfill it. Also, just because someone has a purpose does not meant they know what it is. Purpose needs a clearer definition. The book actually clarifies that definition of purpose partly by this quote:          "There's nothing of any importance except how well you do your work."           This implies that the purpose of man is work, because that it is the most import thing that you (assuming) work and do it well. What type of work, that seems to be up to the individual. The views in this book are extreme of course. I do agree that the definition of purpose must imply that it is not just a goal, but a continues state to be obtained and maintained. However, my point remains that even if you know, in the extreme case, that your only purpose is to do a job (even if it is chosen by you) and do it well, does not mean someone will want to, or will. Someone can simply lack the motivation and drive to accomplish their purpose. THIS I think is the greater problem then finding a purpose. Purpose is easy to find, it is taking action toward the fulfillment of purpose that people find difficult. There is always some action to be take to take toward a purpose. If you cannot find a way to immediately fulfill your purpose you must find out what goals you must meet first so you will have opportunity to fulfill your purpose. The point, there is a constant action, there is momentum that must happen. If someone cannot even find the motivation to define what purpose is important in their life then that lack motivation is the greatest deprivation they can have.  Comments?
