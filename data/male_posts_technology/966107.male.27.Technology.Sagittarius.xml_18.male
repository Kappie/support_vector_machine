A best friend tries to fulfil those expectations always no matter what  there is not phrase like impossible. A best friend is always there for you when you need someone alongside you.    I think its best not to have a best friend. You risk getting disappointed. No expectations... no falling short of expectations... no disappointment... no unhappy moments... Sounds simple, doesn't it? But its not always that simple. Once you consider someone as your best friend its pretty difficult not to have expectations  you can't help feeling disappointed.    That's what I plan to do henceforth. I won't have any expectations from my best friend. This was my first weekend alone after a long long time and I felt that my best friend could have spent some time with me just to make me feel good. But it was not to be. It does not mean that I consider someone as a best friend means that that person should consider me as a best or even a good friend. Just a matter of matching the expections, no?
