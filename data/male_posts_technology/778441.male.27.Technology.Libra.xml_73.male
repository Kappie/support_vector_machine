Ordinarily, it wouldn't much of a news. But this is not ordinary. These scientists shook hands with each other even though they were located 3000 miles apart!! Whoa!... long hands!!!... you might exclaim! But this was not a news to announce a medical breakthrough in lengthening limbs. Instead it was a news item announcing that these scientists were able to actually shake hands over the internet. Sounds incredible, doesn't it?!! Its true! These people used the high bandwidth fibre-optic cables to send across small impulses at very high frequencies. These impulses re-created the sense of touch. You can read more about this breakthrough  urlLink here . So now... if you are chatting with someone on the Net and get an urge to get touchy-feely... you know what to do! ;)  One commodity that's quite abundant in the world is stupidity and daily we hear about someone or something that just adds to this ever-growing reservoir of stupidity. Take the case of  urlLink this  jobless burglar who stole about 10,000 Swiss Francs worth equipment and fled. His only mistake in this whole affair was that he left his CV behind at the scene of crime!! ... complete with name and address!! How much more can you expect a person to be!! :-|  You must've heard about the funniest joke in the world... the one about the hunters who went to the woods for hunting. This was selected as the best and the funniest joke from among a collection of 40,000 jokes collected from all over the world. The study was carried out by the  urlLink Laughlab  created by Dr. Richard Wiseman (University of Hertfordshire) in association with the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Well, anyways... here is the joke that lost out to the first placed joke in the final round... Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson go on a camping trip.  After a good dinner and a bottle of wine, they retire for the night, and go to sleep. Some hours later, Holmes wakes up and nudges his faithful friend. "Watson, look up at the sky and tell me what you see." "I see millions and millions of stars, Holmes" replies Watson. "And what do you deduce from that?" Watson ponders for a minute. "Well, astronomically, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets.  Astrologically, I observe that Saturn is in Leo.  Horologically, I deduce that the time is approximately a quarter past three. Meteorologically, I suspect that we will have a beautiful day tomorrow. Theologically, I can see that God is all powerful, and that we are a small and insignificant part of the universe. What does it tell you, Holmes?" Holmes is silent for a moment.  "Watson, you idiot!" he says.  "Someone has stolen our tent!"  Well, here's something interesting! ... My friend  Rochelle  thinks I resemble a cat!! Now, when I asked her the reason for that she said it was because I appeared to be comfortable! ... or basically very untroubled at all times! ... *LOL* ... I told her she looks like a deer! ;-)  One of my friends sent me the following in a mail today. Its a repeat, but a good read anyways!...  (some knowledge of the programming language 'C' would help... but its not a must... you would understand it easily!) ...  struct female_professionals { double styles; short skirts; long time_to_understand_problems; float mind; void knowledge; char non_co-operative; };  struct married_females { double weight; short tempered; long gossip; float hopes; void word; char unstable; };  struct engaged_females { double time_on_phone; short attention_on_work; long boast; float on_cloud_nine; void understanding; char edgy; };  struct newly_married_females { double dinner_invitation; short time_at_work; long lunch_break; void bank_balance; char hen_pecked; };  struct husband_wife_professionals { double income; short tempered; long time_no_see_each_other; void love_life; char money_making; };  struct beautiful_city_girl { double boyfriends; short affairs; long stories; void greymatter; char flirt; };  struct old_lady { double chin ; short memory; long sighs ; void attention_from_men; char chatterbox; };  *LOL*... females explained!!  Anyways... today is a rare blip on my social-radar! My friend is treating me and a few other friends to dinner. Its been a long time since I ate out... bcos the past couple of months have seen me working from 8 to 8 in the office! So... its a welcome change! :)  Ok... with this I take your leave for the moment!  cheers!
