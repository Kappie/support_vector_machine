I did end up learning something about myself - in that I now know more about the kind of girls I "don't like" than about the kind I do.  It's just that it is a lot of fun pickin' away at people - and at times it can be very humorous.   I only say things sometimes - in a effort to be funn (all in good fun - what are we doing if we can't laugh at ourselves  and others ?)  That's ok rite?  'Cause we're here for a good time... not a long time...  However - we're not going to get along with everyone all the time - and sometimes it's best if we just stay away from the people that rub us the wrong way.  I personally have a lot of good friends that I can learn so much from - about how to deal with being around people that you don't necessarily like being around.  On the other hand, I do find it very difficult being fake - and well, there are certain types of people with which I have   great   personality conflicts.  Well, I think it's pretty safe to say that I am still in the learning process when it comes to bein' a true gentleman... I am wanting to be more of a gentleman though - that's got to be a good sign - and it's not just to get the pussy!
