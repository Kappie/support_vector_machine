We don't know much yet, but from what I can discern about the story I want to make some comments.   First of all after reading the story on CNN.com I, just for the hell of it, went to FoxNews.com to read what they had to say. It immediately struck me how the story was completely different depending on whether you were reading CNN or Fox News. So my concern is for the people who get their first and maybe ONLY news from Fox News, either on TV or on the net.   I will first tell you what I can deduce from reading the story so far. Keep in mind that my current interpretation might not be what things turn out to be, but stay with me.   As far as I can tell former President Clinton asked Sandy Berger to go through all the relevant documents during his administration that are stored at the National Archives that needed to be given to the 9/11 commission. ApparentlySandy Bergerwas up all night and and trying to speed read through all the documents and put them in piles to either give to the 9/11 commission or to give back to the Archives. All this time he was taking notes on the documents as well. He says that he put the notes in his pockets and mistakenly took some classified documents with him in his portfolio that he had taken into the screening room. Now apparently one staffer at the archives claimed that they saw Sandy put documents into his socks. He denies this.   Ok I know this is alot of info. But I want to use this story to try to illustrate how Fox News blatantly spins the news for a right wing agenda, and worse HIDES that fact behind a "Fair and Balanced" moniker!   First here is the CNN.com article.   urlLink CNN.com - Feds probe Clinton aide over missing papers - Jul 20, 2004   Ok some keys quotes from that article.    "Law enforcement sources said archive staff members told FBI agents they saw Berger placing items in his jacket and pants, and one archive staffer told agents that Berger also placed something in his socks. " OK notice that one staffer said something about the socks. Further that is denied by Berger's friend. There is also some discussion about how the timing of this leak is curious since the investigation into this incident has been taking place since October, and next week is the start of the Democratic National Convention, and the 9/11 Report is due out this week. Ok and a last quote;    "In the case of the classified documents removed from the archives, the associate said Berger was reviewing thousands of documents and trying to "power read" as much as possible -- placing some in a pile to be forwarded to the 9/11 commission and others in a "nonresponsive" file to be returned, because he did not believe they were relevant to the commission's requests.   Berger has told associates and his attorneys he deliberately set aside drafts of the millennium plot after-action report because it was a longer document and "he knew he needed to take some time on it," according to one adviser.   In Berger's account, after hours of reading documents, he inadvertently took the documents he had set aside to read later along with other materials and a leather portfolio he had carried into the screening room." Ok now onto FoxNews.com story.   urlLink FOXNews.com - Politics - Sandy Berger Probed Over Terror Memos   First quote;   "Former President Clinton's national security adviser is under criminal investigation for taking highly classified terrorism documents that should have been turned over to the independent commission probing the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, FOX News has confirmed." Ok I think that this quote construes that Sandy Berger is under investigation for taking documents and then NOT turning them over to the 9/11 Commission. My understanding is that he only mistakenly took copies of documents that he was reviewing, and that the Commission received all documents in question. I could be wrong. Next quote VERY disturbing;   "Berger and his lawyer said Monday night he knowingly removed the handwritten notes by placing them in his jacket, pants and socks, and also inadvertently took copies of actual classified documents in a leather portfolio." This quote is categorically WRONG! And as of 10:43PM MDT FoxNews.com has still yet to "fix" this. Berger and people on his behalf have called the socks comment completely untrue, and certainly Berger and his lawyer did not say that he knowingly removed the notes in his socks!   Now the fox story has sub-headlines which seem to have some strange connotations.   'Inadvertent' Action? is the headline. Notice that Inadvertent is in quotes and it ends with a question mark. That says to me that they are calling Berger's claim of this being an inadvertent mistake as questionable. Maybe I am making too much out of this. But I am going now so I might as well keep going.    "Although lawmakers didn't want to make a judgment call on Berger's fate until all the facts are known, they agreed that the situation doesn't look good for Berger, or even for Kerry." Sure. Here's the follow-up quote; "There's an ethic here -- that is of strict discipline, of not letting the fact you're working on a political campaign start to color your actions when it comes to national security," Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., told FOX News on Tuesday."  Oh man they are jumping right on this, and I didn't see any of these quotes in the CNN.com article. ANYWAYS, another sub-headline:   More 'Innocent Than It Looks?'  Notice again the same technique, the line is in quotes with a question mark at the end. Argh!   Ok there is more but I had better stop. Sorry for the rambling.
