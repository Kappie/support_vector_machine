As time progresses, however, RIAA looks less and less like an association who's on the side of truth and fairness.  Yes, we need to get people to stop stealing music.  No, I do not believe the RIAA has any of the solutions to solve this problem.  Seems to me the RIAA is their own biggest enemy. ;)  05/17 update: I subscribe to  urlLink iTunes Music Store  this weekend and tried out Apple's solution to music piracy.  Hey, RIAA, go talk to someone who got it right, eh?
