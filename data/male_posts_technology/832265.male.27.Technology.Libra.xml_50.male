What a great idea to make an apocalyptic movie that goes after the absurd rather than the sentimental.  Plus, there's the great choice to forego all explanation and just present The End as spooky, blown out twilight rather than trying to pass off some legitimate explanation.  Much better to get right to the good stuff like the gas company employee (played by David Cronenberg) who spends his last day at work calling his customers to thank them for their patronage.  Those Canadians - so nice, so wacky and so untroubled by gun violence despite their comparable socio-economic demographics and love of firearms ... or so I've been  urlLink told .
