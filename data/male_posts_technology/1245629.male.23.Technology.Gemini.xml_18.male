For all you people who say, "I love you" when you have no clue what  love is exactly!!! Something to ponder upon...   Are your palms sweaty, is your heart racing and is your voice caught within your chest?? It isn't love, it's LIKE.   You can't keep your eyes or hands off of her, am I right?? It isn't love, it's LUST.   Are you proud, and eager to show her off?? It isn't love, it's LUCK.   Do you want her because you know she's there?? It isn't love, it's LONELINESS.   Are you with her because it's what everyone wants?? It isn't love, it's LOYALTY.   Are you with her because she kissed you, or held your hand? It isn't love, it's LOW CONFIDENCE.   Do you stay for her confessions of love, because you don't want to hurt her? It isn't love, it's PITY.   Do you belong to her because the sight of her makes your heart skip a beat?? It isn't love, it's INFATUATION.   Do you pardon her faults because you care about her? It isn't love, it's FRIENDSHIP.  Do you tell her every day she is the only one you think of? It isn't love, it's a LIE.  Are you willing to give up all of your favorite things for her sake? It isn't love, it's CHARITY.  Does your heart ache and break when she's sad? Then it's LOVE.   Do you cry for her pain, even when she's strong? Then it's LOVE.  Do her eyes see your true heart, and touch your soul so deeply it hurts? Then it's LOVE.  Do you stay because a blinding, incomprehensible mix of pain and relation pulls you close and holds you to her? Then it's LOVE.   Do you accept her faults because it's a part of who she is? Then it's LOVE.  Are you attracted to others, but stay with her faithfully without regret?? Then it's LOVE.   Would you give her your heart, your life, your death??  Then it's LOVE.  Now, if love is painful, and tortures us so, why do we love? Why is it all we search for in life? This pain, this agony? Why is it all we long for? This torture, this powerful death of self? Why?   The answer is so simple cause it's...LOVE.   It is such an addictive thing that even people who are not having it wish to experience it and share it with others as well.
