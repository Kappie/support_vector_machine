That is a different matter.  The second thing that should be said is there really isn't any way to eat Tic Tacs one at a time if they are orange. I eat one. Then I "carelessly" (that's the lie I tell myself) shake out five or six, and before my conscience has time to kick in, I toss all of them in my mouth. After that, it's always five or six, sometimes as many as ten. What a guilty flavorama.
