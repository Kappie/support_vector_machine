He is almost always considerate of other peoples' feelings and truly cares about his friends, even when they aren't nice to him.  Give him another year, and he will find out how insincere and superficial other people really are, and turn bitter and hateful like me.  For now, he is wonderfully naive.   It turns out I was wrong on several counts.  A year later, he has not turned spiteful and bitter like me yet, and I hope he never feels he has to.  He has learned to protect himself a little while still feeling free to express himself at home, usually in an appropriate manner.  More importantly, I am learning from him (and from therapy) that it is not normal or healthy to turn spiteful and bitter and hateful and angry.  If I can re-learn how to protect my inner self in an appropriate way, I can learn to interact with people without being scared and mistrustful of them.
