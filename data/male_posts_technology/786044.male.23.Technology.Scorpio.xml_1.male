I'll be submitting it to the 2004  urlLink Steel Toe Books  poetry contest. I'm not entirely sure that link is going to work... Anyway, I'm very happy to have finished it, but plan on adding to it until I come up with an equally catchy title for a new book. When I decide it's finally finished, I'll make copies available at  urlLink the Fan P store .  Fan P walking...
