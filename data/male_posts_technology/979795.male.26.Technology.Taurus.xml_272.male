Yuishinkai has a really soft touch to their techniques and their class practice with an open attitude. There was a casual atmosphere throughout the stretch of class. Everyone was friendly and approachable.  We started with some stretches at a faster rythm then I was used to. A lot of ukemi too. A lot of emphasis on Ki extension and balance (ie. imagine your head is lifted by a think string, etc). It was an interesting and fulfilling class. Sure it seemed slower then the class I was used to. But they pointed out plenty of minute details in my technique I had not noticed before. Ki extension (the simplest one), isn't that impossible for me afterall.  All in all, it was a really fascinating experience. I might actually drop in more often to reinforce some of my concepts and fundamentals again.
