I am very forgetful, so this list will keep me on track.   First, I need to add some links, mostly related to the filmmaking department. Since currently I am planning to play around with the super 8 film format, I will add a few pages that have to do with this subject:   http://www.flickerla.com/  http://www.8mm.filmshooting.com/  http://www.super8mm.org/   Okay, now some regular filmmaking links.   http://www.tropfest.com/      (This one is an Australian film festival)  http://www.16mmfilmstock.com/  http://www.college-film.com/   Also, some new anime links:   http://www.animewallpapers.com/  http://www.anime.altocartoons.com/  http://www.advfilms.com/   Next is the "official" M.C.Escher homepage (this is one of my favorite artists):   http://www.mcescher.com/   Other pages that I will be adding are:   http://www.blogger.com   (Don't laugh, I haven't had time to add this guy to my page)  http://javascript.internet.com/   (This page has some seriously cool scripts to add to your web page. I will be adding a few real soon)  http://www.inyourfacebookings.com/   (For all those people who want to book your own wrestling even and have the resources to make it happen)  http://www.coolstuffvideos.com/   (Force Five DVDs !!!!!! Weeeeeeeee !!! Haven't ordered from these guys, but I will be doing so soon)  http://www.neowin.net/  http://www.ign.com/   And finally......   http://sailorecchi.blogspot.com/   (Haven't had time to add this either. Very important !!!)   I also have to update my zombie page with new reviews. I've been meaning to put up a review for the Dawn of the Dead remake and a low budget zombie flick called Shattered Dead. I hope to be able to add these during the week.   Okay, that's just about all that I have planned for this week. Might add some more stuff. Depends on the amount of time I manage to allocate for this task.    Sailor Ecchi
