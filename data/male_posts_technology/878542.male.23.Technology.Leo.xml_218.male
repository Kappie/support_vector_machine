Now I'm back, trying to get some work done, but life and people and internet keep intruding. I think I have a good concept for this environment, but I'm not sure. Running the experiment....  I like the way our internal scripting language has kind of taken shape. It's still very special purpose and hackish, but it has gotten massivly more general pretty quickly. Most expressive.   I still miss the generality of python, though. Maybe I'll bring it up someday? I should probably look into the difficulty of embedding it before I speak up. The relearning curve might be hideous. I don't know. We have put a decent amount of work into this parser, but I'm trying to think of it in terms of total efficiency, rather than sunk investment.
