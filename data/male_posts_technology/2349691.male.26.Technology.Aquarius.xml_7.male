Bike-Push , his room-mate, too started having dizzy spells. Turned out they were both suffering from jaundice. Then the rush started. One by one,  District Committee ,  Bride Seeker  and  Fear Factor  too went home complaining of jaundice. The last one to get infected was yours truly. Wait, that's what everybody thought.  One day, I called up  Lazy Lozenge  from my home, to enquire about his well being. He started screaming at me. Poor chap. He too contracted the disease, and was admitted in a good but cut-throat hospital. Mind you, in Allopathy, there is no cure for Jaundice. The only prescribed medication is 'complete rest'. It is heart-breaking to think of the bill presented to  Lazy Lozenge  from the hospital. And that too, just for using their bed for a couple of days.  Sadly,  Wild Man from Borneo  somehow escaped the Jaundice epidemic.
