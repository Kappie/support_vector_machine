Some things make sense... from  urlLink this  Miguel's blog  there was a flame post in slashdot..   *How do we copy Microsoft and get our "working something" out the door first? Do we go back in time? *  Ulu's Answer: First we should chase and equal them or be slightly lesser and get the people who are not willing to pay huge sums of money for upgrades and then.. If we can get some share then we shall decide the technology that is going to rock... If we don't have market share we can never be deciders and always be followers :(..
