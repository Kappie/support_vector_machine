They are all ADHD or at least one of them. There is not blood relation at all. Its my mom's step family that she has never been close to. I dont even know how annoying they are. I hate being around them because here I am a nerd wearing my nintendo shirt wishing to watch the XPLAY marathon. But they are all watching the football game and I couldnt care less. So I was bored and did not fit in (not like i wanted to) so i hope all you had a good turkeyday not like mine. live long and prosper \\//
