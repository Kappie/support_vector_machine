After realising that it was real, that I was infact all alone....and for a long time, I decided that I would make an effort to get to know Fred the dear neighbourhood cat, who I discovered was owned by George and Barbara, and you all know my hesitations to get to know pets, cos I get attached, and then they die...well I thought it was about time I got over this....so I spent the other afternoon, sitting in the sun, doing some reading and playing with Fred....a couple hours later...he was dead...maulled by a maximus dogus horribiliius....I was so upset....Sorry for waking you Kai, and sorry for not really sounding sad, but I was traumatised, I had heard the cat screetching and people yelling and screaming and had gone out to see what is was, and it was a huge greyhound cross with Fred in a lock jaw by the abdomen, and blood and guts everywhere, and I wasnt allowed to go and hang out with Anna cos she was alone at Spruzen Avenue and James was at work and she said I had to ask James if I could go over, and he said no, cos Marg had told him that no one was to be with anna when he wasnt there....I was soooo miserable (still am)...It was horrible...and just when I was thinking things couldnt get worse....last night my dad told me that my granny has cancer, so anyway....If things keep going like this...I am getting on the first flight outta here....I think Im gonna defer uni tomorrow....its all too much....  Anyway...sorry to be so sad....I will go now...it is great to hear that you both are going good....I miss you....  lots of love me....
