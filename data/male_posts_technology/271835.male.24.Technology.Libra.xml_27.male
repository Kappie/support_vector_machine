Sorry guys, but I have nothing interesting to talk about, just geeky crap about dvd burners, Firefox and my new online dvd rental subscription, which can be read at much better blogs such as  urlLink Mr Torrez's   Move along! Nothing to see here!   Excuse the title, I just felt like adding a cheesy tag line to this post    get well soon Fipi Lele
