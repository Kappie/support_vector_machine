Forgive the personifications, but they are like people in that they each have their own quarks and need different things. Most of them could deal with much more displine, need a change in the way they think (Operating System, Software), and patience as well.   For instance, I'm fixing several computers at the moment at work.... and I'm waiting for them ALL to finish some kind of scan or installation... My patience is running short, I don't like sitting here doing nothing waiting for them to finish. So I blogged this random thought. *Blah*
