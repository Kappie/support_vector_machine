A word of caution too: these files are hosted off my home connection... If they become too much of a burden on my bandwidth, I'll take them down. So whenever possible, please try to keep your downloading to night time.  Oh, and sorry about the wmv format... I would encode them in something a little more cross-platform, but for all its failings, Windows Movie Maker does have the ability to compress video to insanely small files... and it only encodes in wmv. Contact me for a divx version of any of the movies and I'll post it if it's needed.  Thanks :)
