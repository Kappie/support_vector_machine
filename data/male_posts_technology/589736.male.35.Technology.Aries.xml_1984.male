I was merely referring to her presence on the blog (and in the e-mail ring prior to that) and therefore seeing my previous comments on the 2000 election.  As for the political differences, I guess I have never really felt that I have seen your opinions.  I have seen the links you post on the political issues, but I don't take that as necessarily that you agree 100% with them.  Much like if I was to post a link to the Weekly Standard or New Republic or whatever one of the conservative rags are, I doubt you would find that I agree with it 100%.  It also sounds like you feel like I did from the moment Clinton took office and declared me, a fresh college graduate making $29,000 a year to be rich.  From that moment on, I wanted that man out of office and would strongly argue against anything he said.  Miriam - I can't respond to most of your post without seriously offending some people personally, and I do not want to that.  Argue and attack the points, not the poster, so I won't.  The economy is a cyclical thing.  We had about 10 years of positive growth from the early 80's to early 90's, then a recession, then about 6-7 years of positive growth from 93-94 to early 2000.  It will happen again.
