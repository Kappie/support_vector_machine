Jason drove Dave and I over to Rocky Point one Saturday morning with their bikes on the roof and  urlLink mine  mounted on the trunk.  Unfortunately, we mounted my bike in the wrong orientation so that the front tire was dangling right in front of the car's exhaust.  We heard a loud bang about half way there, but thought we had just run over something.  As it turned out, my front tire had melted, making the innertube explode.
 
 Jason ended up lending me another tire, but it's always bothered me that they don't match.  Like my man  urlLink TJ , I'm big on  urlLink symmetry .  Tomorrow, I plan on finally remedying this problem by going down to Bike Junkie in Bethpage and picking up a new front  urlLink Tioga Terra Firma 26 x 1.95 tire .  They apparently don't make these tires anymore (which shouldn't surprise me since they don't even make my bike any more), so I have to get a set of "slightly used" tires for less than $20.  Or so the bike store owner's wife told me.
 
 The next step?  I have to read the chapter in  urlLink Zinn  about replacing a tire.  I don't quite trust my own bicycle maintenance just yet.  So I'm going to have to take it easy for fear that my wheels fall off in mid-ride.  I don't have to describe how catastrophic that might be.
