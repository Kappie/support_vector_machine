One article about the Police officer on trial for abusing his power to sexually assault women, and another about the groping high school teacher. Now, the following comparison is missing something - it is a snapshot; it is not with respect to time. But it's what came to mind in the time I was perusing the paper. And remember, many modern arguments ignore many more variables than just time.   1 POLICE OFFICER is an abusive sexual deviant (pending conviction). Therefore...   1 out of 172 Eugene police officers are power abusing sex criminals.   1 TEACHER can't stop touching teenage girls. Therefore...   1 out of '800' (I'm guessing that number on the high side) high school teachers are juvenile gropers.    12 (last I heard) US soldiers have been convicted/indicted for prisoner abuse. Therefore...   12 out of 116,000 (or 1 in 9667) US soldiers abuse foreign prisoners.    According to the law of averages, it is far better to be an Iraqi citizen than a Eugene citizen, if you rely on the police and the public school system.
