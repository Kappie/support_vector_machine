The one thing I did notice is that new movies that I could not get yet on Netflix I could get on Blockbuster but I will try it and let you know! Also Blockbuster does not have as big of a collection as Netflix but it is still rather extensive! Just have to see how the mailing is! I will keep you updated!!
