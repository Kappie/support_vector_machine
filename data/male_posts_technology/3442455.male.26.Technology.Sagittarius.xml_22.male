"Aqua Teen Hunger Force" seasons 1 and 2. "Sealab 2021" "Kill Bill Vol1" and vol 2 when it comes out. Also I need a minidisc player/recorder and an air conditioner if I'm going to survive the rest of the summer. These are the things I need and nobody can tell me different and I will fucking get them or somebody will pay, and of course if I do get them then somebody will also pay, and that somebody who will pay will be me, and the thing that will be paid will be money, and it will be in exchange for the aforementioned items.
