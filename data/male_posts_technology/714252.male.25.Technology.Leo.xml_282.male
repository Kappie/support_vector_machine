Last two nights I watched two pretty heavy movies (Mystic River and Antwone Fisher) Both of which included fairly major plot points about child sexual abuse.  As most of you know already I was abused in secondary school for a couple of months, and whenever I see a movie like that it always reminds me of that time and leaves me dwelling on it for a while. This in general is actually quite healthy and I have spent a long time dealing with the issues surrounding it so overall I am fine, but two nights in a row was slightly heavier going than I am used too.  It also got me thinking about friends of mine who have had their own issues (all sorts of issues.. many and varied etc.) and have this super blinkered approach to them.. How can you show someone that the best thing for them is something that they can't even bear the thought of doing..  Anyway. Enough of the heacy stuff..  TTYL Peeps
