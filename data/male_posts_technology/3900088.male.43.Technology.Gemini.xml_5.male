It turns out there hope for me yet  was reading the blogger homepage  there was details of a woman over 80 yrs old posing blogs, wonder if il be in a fit state to handle the technology that will be around in 40 years time.Just been to see Spiderman 2, was worth seeing, better than the first film i thought which makes a change sequels are ususally crap. IÂ´m tired, time for bed.
