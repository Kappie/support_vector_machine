I'm a married guy, and even when I was single, it was like, *housecleaning*?... okay, now that I've probably offended most of my remaining readership, we really don't tend to follow any sort of strict schedule on that sort of thing (principally because my wife J tends toward the right-brain end of the behavioral spectrum...)   2. My favorite Sunday night program to watch on television is __________.  Historically, my main Sunday-night must-sees were  Good Eats ,  Iron Chef  and/or  WWE Sunday Night Heat , but I've been working on weaning myself from the TV (with some, albeit limited, success), so I don't have any current "gotta"s. A few hours ago, I was watching mostly the BET Jazz network (with the typical cliched male remote control flipping through the premium channels during the commercial breaks...)   3. Monday morning I usually waking up thinking, "__________."  "F$%, I gotta go to work  again ?..."   4. To wind down at the end of a busy day, I like to ___________.  Achieve a state of catatonia via TV-channel-surfing, web-surfing and legally-prescribed medication...   5. I try not to call anyone on the phone until after ______ a.m.  I generally *can't* call anyone before 9, mostly because I'm seldom together (in terms of mental capacity and/or morning hygiene) before then...   6. And I NEVER call anyone after ________.  If we exclude the hours of the day when I'm at the office, that sentence would end "I breathe"...   7. When I don't have to get up to go to work or school, I sleep in until _____.  On average, between 11 am and 1 pm (although 2 or 3 is not unheard of...)   8. I have ____ telephones in my house.  3 functioning ones (that I'm aware of) -- I'm pretty certain that, if we have any cell phones about, they're not much more than paperweights at the moment...   9. I usually answer the phone on the ____ ring.  At work, one -- at home, I generally let it ring four times, then the voice mail picks up; if it's really something  important  (or someone who knows me well enough), then it'll ring again right away, and *then* I'll answer it...   10. When I know I should be sleeping, but am having a hard time falling asleep, I usually _________.  Zone out on the Web (gee, will you look at the time), or the soft-core pr0n on Showtime...
