I would've been there but of course when tickets were purchased I was forgotten about which I'm still slightly annoyed about but oh well. I'm used to it so never mind.  Interesting day at work yesterday. Spent all day on stock room with Dean. Very amusing. He bailed on me for Wednesday though, he forgot he has to work so I only get him for like an hour and you can't see a film in an hour so now I'm gonna see if Rudders wants to come. Did have an idea for Wednesday which I was going to put forward to you Tom but it doesn't matter now seeing as you seem to be in London all the time and I'm sure if my plan work it would turn into another day going anywhere but the place I wanted. Or maybe we'd end up somewhere I didn't have aticket. Oh I don't know. Doesn't matter now.  If Rudders doesn't wanna come to cinema then I guess I'll be at home all day. Wahey. Even though I have tonnes of xmas shopping to you.  I have to go to work. I really don't want to today, I feel too bad and I think I will ask Pam if I can come home if it isn't too busy and there are enough people working. Got my pay. £160. Less than last time but I lost £30 when I was away for the geology trip. Ah well. What is money?   Glad we won. We are the rugby world champions. Yay us. God bless you Johnny.
