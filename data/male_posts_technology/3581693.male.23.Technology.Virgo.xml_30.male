Now I know this will never happen - but still - what kind of person actually thinks that way - enough to put it on the back of her Suzuki Sunrunner.  I hollered out at them as I turned into my subdivision - I'M WAAAAAAAAAAY SMARTER THAN YOUR DOG!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA     Okay, no I didn't - but I thought about it - but I came to the conclusion that I would be a bigger dog if I didn't say anything at all.
