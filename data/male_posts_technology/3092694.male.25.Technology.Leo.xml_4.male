For all of you who dare tread that well worn two lane path of kicking the smoking habit/cruel addiction be forewarned TGSO is not for every one.  Many disclaimers say “contact you physician before starting any…” I say contact your compulsive edgy side, he/she knows you better than any M.D. ever will.  For those of you who would rather not read The Sloth in its entirety, or for that matter Lisa’s copious chronology of the process known as the TGOS (http:/thegreatsmokeout.blogspot.com) I’ll pair it down for you.  Smoke many cigarettes on day one and then systematically cut back over the following 14 days.  Sounds pretty good right?  Bite me!  It’s like quitting every day for 14 days.  14 days of angst and panic, and having no excuse to go outside during the work day.  Actually it’s worse than that because you are still smoking, and smelling of smoking, and feeling crooked in the eyes of healthy bright skinned nonsmokers who make more money than you do, and who have a gym membership that they actually put to good use, and kitchen appliances made of stainless steel, and a water heater that runs on gas which predates 1985, and cuts back on electric costs.  My friend Sandie has been off the squares for a year now.  While she was never the nicotine fiend that I was/am she did it (Go you!) and tells me that cold turkey is the only way to go.  I’ve never understood why they call it cold turkey, (Is cold turkey a cure-all for the shakes of smack withdrawal?) never the less, I think I hear that chilly bird calling my name.  3 smokes down, 3 to go for the day.
