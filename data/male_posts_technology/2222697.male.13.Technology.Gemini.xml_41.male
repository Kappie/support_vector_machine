I got a good grade on my science project and i finished the semester with all A's average ROCK ON !!! NARUTO 65 aired on tv in japan today. So i will expect a fansub this weekend. I hope my GO board comes! I am going to the dallas go club tomorow and harry needs to come with me. If you dont know, harrison is procrastinating because of his website. WHICH HE HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING TO! he has a bad habit of procrastinating. But so do i....but i am working! I am almost finished and all i need is an hour in the middle of the night. But since skool has started again.....it may be a while....I will try to wake up early tomorow to work a little bit.... CYA!
