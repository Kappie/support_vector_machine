So I learn that there is a toaster night out Friday, yet I'm not invited? Great I was really looking forward to celebrating our birthdays with our friends, and then I find out that the time has come and you've actually realised that I don't have a c*ck.  Well, I thought I'd proved myself by constantly drinking you guys under the table, well if you really want to know guys, it has been proven that a womans internal erection is bigger yes  BIGGER  than yours!    Do't give me the blag that you are coming out to really celebrate our birthdays on the Saturday night, I've known you all long enough to realise that the majority of you last the distance until death on a  normal  night out, so I'd hardly expect you all to have a great night out on the  saturday  night.  Yes I am seething that I cannot go out and celebrate our birthdays with OUR friends. would any of you like to learn that your friends are going out yet  you're  not invited? I would also like to point out the times that I have celebrated your birthdays with you, yet now I am not allowed to celebrate my own..?  Don't give me the lads night out line, its never been an issue before and I will question the welcome to the toasterfiles speech etc and the fact that I am still unable to post in my own right.  Ok so I literally have the decorators in right now so please beg my pardon for being irrational and hurt by being shunted by my  'friends'    With lots of love and friendship..
