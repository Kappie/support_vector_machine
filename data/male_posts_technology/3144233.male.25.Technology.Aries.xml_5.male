Despite having the worst weather since day two we made a good deal of progress covering around twenty three miles, which with blistered feet and heavier packs was quite a push. We were a LITTLE unlucky trying to find somewhere to stay and thought we might have to spend the night in a public toilet but thankfully it was only an hour or so. Obviously our kit is pretty well soaked again but with any luck we will be able to get it dried by tomorrow.   The day was all a little rushed and with the weather so bad we were not able to get a picture for you. Sorry about that.  Leo fell over again and the wind is howling.   Hope to send a better update tomorrow. Tired now!  Speak soon.
