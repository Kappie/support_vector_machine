I just put my two kids to bed and figured I try this blogging out.   I initially started to see 'what the blog' is about blogging. Now I have a good idea. Basically blogger is a means for other people to find interest within this inside community. Fascinating, I checked out some other blogs of same interest and everyone seems to either a) post what is occuring in their lives or b) posting information in their work/home/area situations.   Now that I have an idea of what blogging is, I can safely continue forward and see if I acquire any interest in my mundane life.  :  )  I am currently reading Ed Sindson book on Revelation. It's a worthy book, I put him up there with John Hagee and that says alot since I have read many John Hagee books and find them to be to the point, yet understandble.   I am off for tomorrow, being memorial day, but I am also on-call from Saturday to Saturday( yes that means I got home Friday and started call the next morning ). I am hoping for a slow week in that regards, otherwise its going to be busy, busy.   The following week, we have vacation. My family and I will be going to St. Louis and I am sooooo looking forward to it. A week of no cell phones or on-call work.   I have to still catch up on the news, I understand the tornadoes rocked Oklahoma and Missouri. The Saudi Arabia hostages were released and John Kerry still double-talks.  I think I will go check some more blogging and see what I can find.
