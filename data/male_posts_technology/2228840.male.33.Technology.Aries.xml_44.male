In fact, by early Friday morning, Inbound was fully caught up on all duties and responsibilities, an event which I can assure you hasn't happened in quite some time! Of course, as mentioned before, the addition of  CK  and  Newbie  to the place has helped. But since Newbie missed Wednesday and CK wasn't scheduled for Thursday or Friday...  Friday's Big Task was to get ready for  Project X . CK will need a Base of Operations from which to oversee this endeavor, so I set out to establish this for him, with the help of Newbie and our  IT Guy . Naturally, the perfect spot happened to be occupied by countless tons of steel which nobody wanted to claim ownership of and really has no relevant purpose in the process of refurbishing computers. Never the less, as with most things in MSA One, I couldn't throw it out so the bulk of the day was spent relocating it.  Once the area was clear, all that remained was to install a command console. Normally, quite a simple task... However, as IT Guy pointed out to me, there was no existing connection to our network available in this particular location. And so, more of the day was spent fumbling around in the ceiling space between the Server Room and Project X HQ. I had forgotten how much I hate Fiberglas insulation, by the way...  In the end, it all came together nicely. CK will be able to take the Command Chair in Project X HQ first thing Monday morning. And, speaking of Monday morning, rumor has it that  another  of the  Old Crew  will be rejoining us. This is starting to feel like a Back to the Future sequel...
