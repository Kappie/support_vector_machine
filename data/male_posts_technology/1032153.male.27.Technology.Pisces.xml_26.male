The TV is my shepherd, I shall not want, it makes me lie down on the sofa. It leads me away from the scriptures, it destroys my soul! It leads me in the paths of sex and violence for the sponsorsâ€™ sake. Yea, though I walk in the shadow of my Christian  responsibilities, There will be no interruptions for the TV is with me. Its cable and remote control,  they comfort me. It prepares a commercial before me; in the presence of my carnality; It anoint my head with humanism, my coveting runneth over. Surely laziness and ignorance shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house watching TV to the end.

Isn't it amazing how fast time goes. It's not so long ago that it was this time last year! And when you think of it, doing that 70 odd times isn't really that much longer than an hour or two. Life is short. Eternity isn't. Do you know God?
