I would like it for my friends to move here, they would calm down and they have already been bias to their own city because of Tyler and its lan center.  If they could just live here for a month they would change and I wish that they could be here.  Except when they did come they stressed me out and brought some of Colleyville with them, the day after they left I rested all day, and I did not want to be bothered.  It seems I have mixed feelings about this whole ordeal, and I might move back after highschool. I am moving out of the house the first day they let me, hopefully I get to start my business and learn to be a game developer or software designer. I have thought this over more than most teenagers.  About the title, there are these things that make sheep noises but they are small, and I can't catch one to see it. My dad thinks they are frogs but I don't. I will make a website about them and hopefully I will get on  urlLink unscrewed   END
