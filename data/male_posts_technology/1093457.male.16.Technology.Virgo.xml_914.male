"A twelve-inch pianist. You see, I found this magic lamp, rubbed it, made a wish, I got a twelve inch pianist." "Can I try?" The man with the piano agrees and a minute later, a million ducks fill the room. "Ducks? I didn't wish for a million ducks, I wished for a million bucks!" "You think I really wished for a twelve inch pianist?"
