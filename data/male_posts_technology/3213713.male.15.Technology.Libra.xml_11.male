Neways, i explained the rasta to his driver. Then, I sat on the pc for some time. Then, I bathed and changed. Had some milk. Then sat on pc again. Chatted a little. Called Ahsan. He told that he couldnt come bcz car nhin thi :s. Us ko do teen galiyaan dien... phir phone rakh diya. Raamish thori der mein aa gaya. Fasih didnt come... dumb ass. Hamza also came after some time. Then, I played table tennis with Raamish. Damn! I lost 5 consecutive games!! Then we had lunch. After that, we played some NFS. Phir, I beat Raamish twice... but lost twice again!! :(. I couldnt believe it myself. Then, we went for jogging and took Raamish along. He was sooo slow. We had to walk most of the way bcz he couldnt keep up. Neways, when we got back, his driver was here. He left. Hamza also left. I had sth to drink. Then, I sat online. Chatted a little with Ahsan. Then I had dinner. Watched some TV. Played NFS. Hamza came online. And so did that Nabeela. For 2 hours, us ne mera sar khaya. After 12, she left. Since then, Ive been chatting and working on the software. Dad is angry with me. He told me to go sleep but i didnt. He just went to sleep himself. He saw me, but didnt say nething. Damn! Ill hve to do something 2moro... hmmm.
