Again I am completely amazed at how liberals like Gore are unable or worse yet unwilling to grasp the big picture. Here are a few of the more obnoxious quotes I haven't heard discussed yet.   George Bush promised to change the tone in Washington. And indeed he did. As many as 37 prisoners may have been murdered while in captivity, though the numbers are difficult to rely upon because in many cases involving violent death, there were no autopsies.  How dare they blame their misdeeds on enlisted personnel from a Reserve unit in upstate New York. President Bush owes more than one apology. On the list of those he let down are the young soldiers who are themselves apparently culpable, but who were clearly put into a moral cesspool. The perpetrators as well as the victims were both placed in their relationship to one another by the policies of George W. Bush.   Just so I have this clear some Fascists who have acted against America and/or the Iraqi people in Iraq die in jail and this has changed the tone in Washington for the worst? As if the tone in Washington prior to this “unfortunate” incident was something akin to the REM video Shiny Happy People. Isn’t Moveon.org the same bunch of idiots that months ago published Ads that compared Bush to Hitler? Ah…the good old days. What the hell is this “moral cesspool”? Iraq is a moral cesspool because they for the most part like Bush and want freedom? That sounds like hate speech. As for responsibility of both the perpetrators and the “victims” well I have some questions there too. How are the policies of a four year old administration responsible for Islamic hatred of America forget about the actions of the prison guards who are probably filled with a understandable level of anger towards enemy? Note that Gore neglected to point out any real policies that state “kill, torture and otherwise abuse prisoners in the name of America”. Even if our policies are indirectly responsible, and they aren't, if Bush is directly responsible for these deaths, and he isn't, I would like to see the Democrats take direct responsibility for Alger Hiss. They are undeniably guilty of letting Communist spies run free in the government throughout the 20th century putting America’s standing in the world in jeopardy on a level far beyond the "loss of respect" we've supposedly suffered in this case. So what is worse: an American policy that lets Fascist die in jail or one that hires them to make policy?    In my religious tradition, I have been taught that "ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so, every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit... Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them."    Ok, a bit about Gore's supposed “religious tradition” [note he didn’t say beliefs]. Democrats say they support America but historically have sided with the enemy. They opposed invading Afghanistan, so did the Taliban. They opposed overthrowing Sadam, so did Al Qaeda. No sooner did Al Qaeda rear its ugly head in Iraq did the Democrats start screaming for retreat. If we were to only look at the "fruit" of Democrats, say their positions on issues/their votes, the people they choose to support or the policies they put in place then we would be inclined to believe they side with forces opposed to America. They are the first to defend the enemy [sometimes even ahead of France]. Siding with the enemy when the enemy has stated they hate you and will kill you is an action that will only bring about ruin. Make no mistake here Fascist Islam hates Liberal values. Liberals will be the first ones killed. All of Islam’s arguments against American culture are focused on our crumbling morality, something Liberals champion. They are ideological lemmings at heart. Thank God there are enough Republicans around to keep them from driving us all off the bridge with them. So on this point I guess I do agree with Gore. By thier fruit you  will  know them.
