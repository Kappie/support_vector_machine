You know I was really fortunate to have the support of so many friends and co-workers out here that saved my butt so that I didn't have to sleep out on the street.  If it were not for them, I am not sure what would have happened.  My old room mate screwed me over by him not paying rent and so we got kicked out two weeks earlier than expected, and as it turned out I scored this great place one day before the girls came out to visit me.  I actually walked by the place one day and thought, dang, that would be a sweet place to live.  As it turns out, a friend of mine new someone that stayed here, and then they found out there was an apartment for rent.  And I jumped on it right quick.  It's a studio, but pretty big with 2 rooms, bathroom, kitchen, washer and dryer, and a little lanai (balcony) on the 34th floor with an awesome view of waikiki, diamond head, and the ocean.  And it's about 1 mile one way to a bar, and about 2 miles the other way to work.  Holler!
