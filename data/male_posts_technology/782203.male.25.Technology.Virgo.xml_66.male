Sigh if only she wasn't married i would propose to her !   Ok so went for my first jog in months at East Coast with Ben but only jogged like a kilometre before it started to rain. *Bert secretly thanks god* . After that we went to Komala Villas for lunch where i had thosai rava, it was ok but nowhere near as good as the ones at Little India. After that we walked all the way back to his place in which he proceeded to show off his extensive collection of porn in his PC ;) Went back at around 7pm cos he was going to meet his girlfriend.   Arrgh I forgot to watch Charmed today , only managed to catch the last 15 minutes ....but thank god there's still Smallville! My darling Lana Lang ....*swoons*
