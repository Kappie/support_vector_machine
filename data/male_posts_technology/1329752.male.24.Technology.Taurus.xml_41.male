"if one day i'll be dreaming of you once again, i'll force myself to die than waking up in pain that i can't have you in reality.  i never pretended to be a somebody because since then i know i was just a nobody in your life. sometimes i asked myself, "why can't you just go away, stop reading my words and leave me alone"... though deep in my heart it means "why can't you just stay, be with me and continue our friendship..."  you are here still, i want you to know that... occupying the most special space in my heart. i used to see you, i used to stare at you... i used to have this feeling for you, that i know will never be ever change. i guess some people are really meant to be special, and in my life... you are."    i just downloaded the song  color everywhere  by youth asylum and  because i love you  by DNH. i like it.  need to go home.  -fin-
