Visual branding is typically based on the use of large graphics, text that is set as graphics, and special effects such as frames, image maps, custom navigation icons, and animated text and graphics."

 Why is it so hard to understand that  branding on the web is the usability of the site  or product. If you can accomplish the task the site was built to do, you feel empowered. You feel good. That builds loyalty. That is your brand. You can also have clean, crisp site that looks good as well if you know what your doing. It's a shame very few people understand this. It's not about a spinning logo, large gradient fills, or Flash Intros. All that builds is dissatisfaction and annoyances to why you really came to the site in the first place, unless of course you came to look at pretty pictures or frivolous animations.
