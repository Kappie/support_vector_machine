If you are a dood, and commit one of the above mentioned offenses, you deserve a beatdown.  If you're a girl and are an offender....NO MORE DATES! (and if there are, you're paying!)  Both of these things happened to me last night!  I was so pissed I drank a bottle of wine for EACH sin committed.  I was so drunk I actually forgave the person!  Full forgiveness wasn't attained though until me n my buddy H.O.S. (Harvester of Sorrow) hit up a mid-day round of golf.  Hot as fuck...shot a 101 but got a great tan.  On a lighter note, tricky me has taken Friday and Tuesday off.  5 for the price of 2.  Look for me on the golf course, by the pool, or at the skate park!  Whoo hoo!
