Why do I even try to escape in this life. I am cursed to live on like this with out love.  You ask me why am i so sad? well I'm not sad i am a crazy lunatic, who does not like losing out to anything or anyone in life.     All along the lonesome highway, east of Omaha, you can hear the engine moaning out as one song. You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the life before. But your thoughts will soon be wandering like the way they always do, When you are riding 16 hours and there is nothing much to do, and you  dont feel much like travelling, you just wish the trip was through.      Here I am, on the road again, Here I am upon the stage, There I go playing star again, There I go Turn the page.     She is gone.......................................... Like the rest of them, If only i was good enough to be with atleast she would have stayed behing.  All that You build and all that you break, All that you can't leave behind.   Wish you a very happy married life  babe.
