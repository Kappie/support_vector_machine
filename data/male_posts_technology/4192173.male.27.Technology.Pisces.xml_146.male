In non-hypefactor news, a recent Guardian newspaper interview with Scotch charmer Kelly MacDonald included some wonderful news for fans of British drama (such as myself). The BBC ordered a second season of  State Of Play , a six-part series about investigative reporters and political corruption in modern-day London that debuted in the States last month. While substantially shorter than MOG favorite  24  - it is customary for a British TV season to run a mere eight or nine episodes - the two shows share a great deal in terms of pacing (relentless action, frantic dialog, radical camera cuts, heart palpatations.) In the first season, the i-team tied a government researcher's murder and a drug shooting to an energy scandal in the British parliament, with plenty of unexpected twists. Admittedly no arms were severed in the making of the series, but this program can effortlessly hold a candle to  24  or any other mystery-action show.  Need more convincing? The original cast, most of whom are tipped to return, includes MacDonald, John Simm (Bernard Sumner in  24-Hour Party People , a raver in  Human Traffic ) and Bill Nighy (the aging rock star in  Love Actually ), among countless others. And MacDonald, despite being married to a twit who plays bass in Travis, is worth the price of admission alone. Sadly, the BBC is rubbish when it comes to issuing DVDs in a timely fashion, and the first season of  State Of Play  is no exception: The Beeb's Web site lists a release date in February 2005. I hope, however, that BBC America will run the series a few more times in the interim for those who missed MacDonald's gorgeous accent. And the other stuff, of course.
