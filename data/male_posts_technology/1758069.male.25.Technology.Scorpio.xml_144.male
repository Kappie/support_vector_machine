SNAP!  ETC.!).  i don't normally watch cartoons, but i caught  the justice league  on cartoon network last night, and there was this great line where hawk girl, mace in hand, flew at a creature to attack it and yelled "hawk girl smash!"  it made me laugh, plus it could be a good band name.    album du jour:   urlLink   snowdonnas        over now
