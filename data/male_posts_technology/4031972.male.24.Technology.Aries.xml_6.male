Had a tough time in office. The biggest difficulty was to hold my mobile in my right hand.  Then came a bigger blow when I learnt that my hard disk was corrupted beyond recovery. Arnd 20 GB of data and songs gone. 5 yrs of hardwork. Nuthing much can be done. Infact I was planning to exchange my comp last week but postponed it so that I cud write the data on a CD.  Neway, waiting for my new computer. Hope to get that done this week end. Need to discuss the paisa detais with Appa.  I plan to blog on movies and music as well. I am big fan of Tamil Film Music and Illayaraja, SPB and  urlLink Karthik  in particular. I do watch a lot of movies. Will write reviews of movies in future.  Had a bad AIMCAT503. Preparing for 504. Preparing for CAT while working is really difficult. But that is what pressure is all about. Need to crack the CAT.
