Ellatheyum addikadi format panna vendiyadha irrukku.  Ram, I didn't understand your case study at all. Anyone made any sense of it.  Dei, I can understand Eco, but not your case study. As Kicha said, the answer is a road, actually I was thinking of a highway.  I guess this weekend will be a treat weekend for those in Bangalore, Kicha and Rini completing 1 year at thier work. Ram celebrating his birthday. Enjoy it.  I was planning to go to Maduraio this weekend. But as my parents are going to Hyderabad, I decided to stay at home.
