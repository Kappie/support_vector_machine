(I knew that before, but you never want to admit it.)  My shoulder is sore.  I thought my elbow would be, but it is ok.  It was great excercise for me.  Got me breathing and broke a good sweat.  I am thinking of getting a bucket of balls, and keeping me, Hunter, and Jonathan (my 5 yr. old T-Baller) busy hitting this summer.
