It's basically a way for you to stay connected to your friends online. And you are also connected to their friends , as in you can view their profiles and try to get to know them if you want. Anyway you should check it out , and if you wanna add me then just search for me using my singnet email addy, if you don't know it then you don't deserve to be my friend !  Hmpph! Ok you know what I sounded really bitchy there, it's a little scary. Ignore that.
