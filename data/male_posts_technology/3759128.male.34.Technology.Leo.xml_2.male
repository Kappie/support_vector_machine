She had a great display and attracted a reasonable amount of interest for a Friday night, in a quiet little town.    The thing that surprised me about Kent, was actually how cool the downtown area seemed to be.  I have been to Kent a few times (mostly to drop off Tonya's Grandma), but have never seen this side of it.   Wandering around, it reminded me of La Conner which Tonya and I visited spent the day in last summer.
