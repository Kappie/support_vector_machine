The teachers were hilarious though, all smoking like chimneys and half of them turning up pissed or stoned! What a bad example to set! Anyway, I thorogulsy enjoyed myself and I will remember that night forever, I really will. It was absoultely brilliant, even down to the last details like Mrs Kent beeping at us on the motoway cos we were all waving out the windows like looneys, oh and of course Oliver winning Best Smile, he was in his element last night! I really thoroughly enjoyed myself, thank you all for making it so special for me! I got to go guys, my hair is still a mess, see you at Andy's!
