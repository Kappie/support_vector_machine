After  Dil Chatha Hain  I had a feeling that there was going to be something different about  Lakshya  as well.   The movie got released in Bangalore on the 18th (Friday) and the first thing I did after getting up on the 19th was to go to  Innovative Multiplex  and book the tickets. Lucky me for when I reached the theatre the tickets were only available for the night show.  The show was at 10:00 in the night. When I reached the theatre with Kalpana, Asif and Chetan (Asif's friend who is studying at IIM-B) I found that they were screening the movie in all four screens. For a while I thought the people at  Innovative multiplex  were damn rich guys to have the courage of buying four prints of the movie. Later, after talking to one of the gate boys, I found that they actually had one print but they would be running it in all four screens. For a while I could not make any sense of out it so I kept bothering him for more details to which he gave me the following explanation. The four screens of the multiplex were at the four corners and hence the central projection area for all the screens was same. So, the reel would be fed to the first projector and then to the second, followed by the third and fourth. This way all the four screens would be showing the same movie with a delay of just about four to five seconds between them. Amazing isn't it. Well, I wondered if this was legal? Anyway, due to the arrangements the movie got deferred by 20 minutes.   About the movie  Lakshya is a movie about the Kargil war but is completely different from the regular "Sunny Deol" stereotypes. Its is all about a boy who is not sure of what he wants to do with his life till is joins the army and ends up becoming a captain at the LOC. The movie is about the transformation of Hrithik from a confused person to a focused individual and the gifted director has handled this change in an outstanding manner. The cinematography is awesome especially the ones at Kargil. One nearly misses a beat in the rock-climbing scene that talks loudly about sheer professionalism. I was literary in tears in the scene where Hrithik talks to his father before going for the mission. This movie is worth the 120 bucks spent and I am going to see it again even if Kalpana sits on my head and bangs it.    urlLink Read more
