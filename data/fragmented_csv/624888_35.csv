 variable winds this afternoon.  High pressure anchored over the SE US will control the weather through the weekend providing mostly sunny skies and moderating temperatures.  Each day through the forecast period the air mass will become a bit more polluted as the stable air mass leads to little mixing and particulate readings in the lower YELLOW range (GENTRY).
