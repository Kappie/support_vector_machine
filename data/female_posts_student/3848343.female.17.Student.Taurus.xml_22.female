Always being blamed, always copping shit, I’m done, it’s over, I’m sick of it. It will be final, life will end. You will carry on all as friends. Never will I see it from your eyes, Never will you have to hear my cries.  It seemed to me that we were friends, It could have been forever, till the very end. Those times have changed, we had to move on. You can leave your time has gone I will look from afar and see what may have been, Wonder and wish but never have seen We have to stop, forget and forgive. But how can we do that, it’s too hard to live.  Is it the answer, is it the way Or do I say goodbye another day. You may have happiness and love in your eyes, But mine are blank and its up to me to say our goodbyes  My final goodbye, the time has come. My journey, my trip, my life is done. U tried to help, but it didn’t work. It wasn’t you but I was hurt. Cya sometime, another day But until then all I have to say. This is it, the end My final goodbye goodbye  this is the first one ...more to come
