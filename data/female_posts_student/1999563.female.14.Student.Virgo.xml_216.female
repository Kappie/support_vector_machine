Ok, thiws mronign I went on this service trip thang and I was like "Uh..it will  be fun, I think..."  So I arrived at the chruch and I just talked to Shannon and the Duferenens (Hah) starteed to arive... [Big long side note.....in the summer we went on a service trip there but I didn't go. They served all these people. ETc....Etc..]  So I was like they are..interesting.  So we all went on the bus and went to Portland where we packed clothes 'n such into these boxes.  It was funnn!!  We foudn a pair of dirty unndeeerrwears! :o    So it was fun and I met all these AWESOME dufor people!!! Like this awesome cowboy who had a big belt buckle, boots, and a cowboy hat. his name was THAD!!! Isn't that the coolest thing you have ever heard? He was pretty hot to.  All the girls were like "THHAAAAAD!! we lovvvee Thad!" He farms sheep! Then we went to steakburger and ate. My awesome friend SARAH (I LOVE YOU! E-mail me!)  ate with me. Keary and Sarah's twin (who I forget his name..) Ate with us at our table too..   So this was pretty odd...  Sarah's twin and I both got the same thing... He was like I got a burger but I really wnated to cheese but I had to pay 40 cents, but I got it anyways... And i was like "me to...hmm"  Then we started talking about tarter sauce and he was like "I loooooove tarter sauce!" and I was liek "me too...  Then, the person comes with our drinks and we both had the SAME THING! A blackberry milkshake! :O It was like crazy dude :)  Then Keary and Sraah went off and this whole "You were meant to be together" thang. I was like oh geeez...save me!  Hahahha He was prety coolie though.   Then the service day was over and I had to go to voice, in case you didn't know I have been super sick so I couldn't really talk, never the less sing.  So we just sight read the whole thing wich was booooorrrrringg. Then we went to church and I saw the DUFOR people again! YIPPEEE!! They are so sitnkin' cool. They make me mucho happys.  Then we had to go to portland to get a c-mas present. I was my dress at that cool store again! :)  Then we went to churchy again and I saw the DUFOR people!!! YIPEE!!   I love them! They are all farmers and they are sue-wheat. They were all soooo nice to me, thats why I love them.  I guess thats al.  Peace out my man. (or men?)   Laura  AKA.   DUFOR LOVER!  Keary and I am moving there.
