I get ops in two or three channels that let me kick people I don't like (I like to excercise my power a lot :D), and I've managed to drag Ginchan and Boots into it so I'm not completely alone all the time. It's great.  I'm getting dragged on a road trip next summer (or maybe the summer after, depends on how fast we can amass enough money). We'll be going to Florida, Rhode Island, Michigan, and Canada (Alberta). Ginny, Monica, Justin, Travis, Sam, Takeda, and I are all going to get crammed in a van for two weeks. We haven't completely figured out what we're going to do after everyone gets picked up, but I'm thinking we'll pitch a couple tents and camp out in the Canadian wilderness a couple days. The exitement I have for this trip makes me want to pee myself. It would make a nice graduation present.  Ok I'm tired and in the middle of an arguement with Dave (go figure), so I'll blog after I go see Anchorman with Monica and Ryan or something. Maybe.   Current Mood:  None
