I don't like this...my school is known as a school that doesn't care when actually we are the ones that care the most b/c everyone is always in everyones business and always judging people and i hate it sooo much....it can't get much worse...aw well...i've got my true friends behind me 100% and i'm glad to have em...all you other fakes leave me alone...thanks
