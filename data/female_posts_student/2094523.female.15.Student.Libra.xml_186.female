Its bout life and how life is just a candle and it just lasts as long as a candle and can easily end. how we are just actors on the stage that play a part but after the show is done no one knows who u are no one remembers u, it was just like.. a trend. a short trend that one follows but eventually ditches. and after generations.. you become nothingness because no one on earth remembers you. maybe they'll only know ure name but they'll never know you. or.. sometimes ure name disappears along with ure death. I always hear you say: "next yr ill do this.. blahblah" well u knwo what? what if next yr doesnt come? and the year after won't either? what then. all i know is this very second im alive.. what happens next.. im clueless
