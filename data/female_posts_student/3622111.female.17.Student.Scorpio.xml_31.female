Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.  He's BLIND!!!! BLIND!!!!!!!!!  I worry for his safety.  He probably wouldn't be able to leave our country in one piece...  Btw, Mary, it's called cruising...? Not free. Going to Zhongshan for two days with parents. Just to get away from everything. You know. Especially the Stress and Tension. =P
