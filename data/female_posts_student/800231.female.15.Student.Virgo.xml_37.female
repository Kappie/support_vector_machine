I was quite surprised, I don't think I've ever had them that badly before. So, I took some Excedrin and went back to sleep. The only problem is now I have so many absences that I may have to appeal for credit. Oh well, no biggie.  My school has once again decided to show its individuality by giving us a holiday that no one else in the district has. Yesterday they called off school for no reason. I suppose I should be thankful but it was just bloody weird, probably has something to do with our new live-in superintendent. Anyhow, I had nothing better to do so I went downtown for shopping and photographing crap. It was actually really fun, we should have more random vacations.                     urlLink Marriage is love.
