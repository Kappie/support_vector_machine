We set things straight and we are breathing again. *smiles* I know life is hard and it seems like everything bad is happening to me, but it is happening to a lot of other people. Im just crazy! Im trying to collect the Neopets from the Happy Meals at McDonalds..I'll be eating hamburgers and chicken nuggest for weeks..I'll have fries coming out of my ears soon..XD Anyway, im bored again. I just gave Game Trader all of the consoles (Xbox, N64, and other shit) I have 156 in store credit. I need 129 for the PS2 and I have it! With 20 something left over. Im happy kinda..They don't have any PS2's in at teh moment. Ah, well im trying to ready myself from my 15 year old cousin tomorrow..He gets hard off of me and im grossed out about it. He is a little messed up in teh head..I think he likes me a little TOO much. Lol......Yeah. I have mah babers though! Hehehe..                                           *.*)>                                     PH34R T3H D4NCING KIRBY!
