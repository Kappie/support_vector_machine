I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder  Or return to where we were   Well I will go down with this ship And I won't put my hands up and surrender  There will be no white flag above my door  I'm in love and always will be   I know I left too much mess  And destruction to come back again  And I caused but nothing but trouble  I understand if you can't talk to me again  And if you live by the rules of 'It's over'  Then I'm sure that that makes sense   Well I will go down with this ship  And I won't put my hands up and surrender  There will be no white flag above my door  I'm in love and always will be   And when we meet  As I'm sure we will  All that was then  Will be there still  I'll let it pass  And hold my tongue  And you will think  That I've moved on  Well I will go down with this ship And I won't put my hands up and surrender  There will be no white flag above my door  I'm in love and always will be Dido - White Flag
