Dunno where id stay, whatever. i hope me and jessie come here next summer and trip out like crazy. and just run amok in london. yeah. anyway.   dylan is being mean to my friends again. stop it, dylan!  anyway. i have to go, my aunt wants to go back to the flat where were staying and she wants me to come so we can go shopping and i can carry some of the groceries.  i miss you all...  i love you, dylan...  ~abby
