I'm feeling better today though, last night Wonder Woman and I watched Notting Hill, and who wouldn't be in a good mood after that?  That's such a good movie, I love British humor.  Oopsy daisy!     It was so  cute I got to church today, and the Easter bunny had visited the Tech room.  There were york pepermint patties all over.  It's been so long since the easter bunny visited it was awesome.  The service struggled though.  I think it was two years ago that we decided that since we get so many people coming on Easter that never come other wise, we should minister to them, and do sort of a seeker service on Easter.  But this year we did traditional hymns, and we didn't even have any power point.  And of course we said the Lords prayer and the apostles creed without putting them on the screen.  I have no problem with saying them, it's just that the new people aren't going to feel very welcomed when they don't know the words, and have to fake it.     We did that at our really contemporary service (designed specifically for people who are maybe not quite christian yet) too.  We had two baptisms, but we said the apostels creed during them, and we didn't put it on the screen, so even the family who was up for the baptism didn't know the words.  It was aweful.  We definitly need to work on that hospitality thing.
