We took a tender boat out to middle of the ocean arounding surrounding landscapes of snow covered mountains and little islands.  I saw 4 killer whales with white markings, 2 humpback whales  a ton of seals.  It was just amazing. The ocena was so calm and the air was crisp. I will never forget the experience. I thought today about coming back to Alaska for 3 weeks and staying in a cottage. Just to experience the wildlife and live a simple life.  I saw 2 huge glaciers as well (the hubbard in the far view that we were able to view so closely yesterday.)  A spectacular experience. I took a ton of photos and can't wait to share with everyone.   Short blog today though as I am busy organizing my tables for tomorrow's final formal night. Must head off and finish!  Best wishes to everyone and see you in 16 days.    >>
