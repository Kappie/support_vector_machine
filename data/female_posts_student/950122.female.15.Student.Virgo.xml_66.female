Lately I've only been hearing about prom dates, prom dresses, make up and all that.. stuff. I'd say crap, but in a few days I might have the fever too. > not  going to the prom feel. Like Gretchen. She wasn't allowed to go the prom. That really sucks. She barely gets to go out with us, and now she doesn't get to go to the prom? Geez. She better go to the Grad Ball. *mumble mumble*  Oh! Tomorrow is Thursday... I'm getting my teeth tomorrow! XD Right now, I've two gaps on the upper teeth.. > long  time ago, but it got posponed because my dentist was pregnant and gave birth. 0_o I'll be getting 2 other teeth extracted after the prom tho. How ouch. Then I'll get braces. Meh.  ERGH!! I'm in such a thing situation with my mom right now. I mean, I know I failed my Trigo test. Nearly everyone did! But I passed Pinoi with a decent grade! And I got the highest in AP in my class! But she still grounded me. (Sorta grounded me. I don't care; she grounded me!!) I mean, she didn't even give me a shred of consideration as to how hard the tests were.  Now that she has High Blood Pressure, she acts like everything I do stresses her out.   *sigh* Seriously, that's not fair. She's still my mom, and I still love her, but the way she's treating me isn't fair at all.  Sometimes, I don't even know why I try.
