She was shocked about it, but she just laughed. She said I was 16, and I don't think she really cared all that much, but I know every parent likes to think that there kid is this perfect little angel, so I kinda ruined that for her. Hmm...I wonder if this gives me the liberty to cuss in front of her? HAH Just kidding mom! I don't cuss...well I do...but...only in my head.  : / Right then, have a good day all, and Man.Utd lost to Arsenal, I saw that coming, but still makes me sad. And mom, I won't ever use the f-word again, it was just the only word to describe that movie....k, bye.
