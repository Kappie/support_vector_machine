Hm........am keeping my eyes open for some good purchases tomorrow....that is, if I can convince mum to lend me enough money. :p My last shopping trip washed all of my remaining cash out. -_-  Oh well...I just want something new for myself to just pamper myself a bit this holiday. :p And hopefuly I WILL get something good tomorrow. =)  --Fluffles--
