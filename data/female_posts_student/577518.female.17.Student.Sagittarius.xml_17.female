P always jeolous if I'm better than her and always pretended that she's stupid than me; but Mei Shan willing to share anything with me, she's such a good classmate! Thank God! Oh, I love the picture from the quiz (below). Feel so calm when looking at it, and it's very match with this green layout. Ah, I'm tired. Need to study right now, tata~
