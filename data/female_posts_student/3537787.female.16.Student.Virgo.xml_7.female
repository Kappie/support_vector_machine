I've been messed with before, I don't want it again When will you boys start acting like men?  I was calm and poised, mature and stable With your antagonism now I'm simply unable  To keep up with the innuendo, the mind warbling spree That somehow your twisted mind has put upon me  Fly away from the nest if you bark and don't bite Let go of yourself, sail away like a kite  Leave anyway, anyhow, but whatever you do Make sure the last thing I see isn't you  Because you are driving me absolutely and incredibly insane But your welcome to call me when you've found your brain
