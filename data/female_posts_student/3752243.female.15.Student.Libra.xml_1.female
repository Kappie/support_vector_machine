Ok so tonight (tee hee) I had a soccer game, and everything was going dandy ( a word that rhymes with Sandy which reminds me of Grease which makes me do this, Oh Sandy Baby someday when highighschool is done!) o wow sorry! Anyways things were going uh...good, when I had to go in net and I was nervous and I didn't like it but I did farely well, if you think stopping 5 and leting in 2 is good, frankly I do so there you negitve Nancy! Anyways it is Tuesday tomorow. I have to go shopping and buy stuff for my friend who shall remain nameless due to she doesn't know about said lets go with "get together." Earlier I made food ate it and felt sick.I started reading the next in the line of books that makes me laugh so hard I pee, but not really of coarse I am a lady, and ladys don't wet themselves...in public. I am full of skittles at the moment and I think that that is a bad idea, due to the fact that o mother dear is making pizza. I will eat some and that will make me sick I can tell, but I am going to do it anyways. It is my friend Kurtis' birthday on Wednesday (if that is the 30th) I think that it is. Today is an election, so in honor of that I am going to start another pole. What movie with Orli is better? Troy (he wears a skirt and at one point in the nuddy pants ((or in englais naked)) ) Or Pirates of the Carribean ( He is all manly like with the swords and the swashbuckling! OOO la la!) I miss Eva and Taryn already, and Sarrah where in the name of Dan are You!!!(FYI: Dan is our makeshift God I being a member of this religion if you will am called a Daniete. Sarrah is the starter. I love her!)Well I am getting over heated and cranky. So I must leave you. Hoccha. Author: Eve
