Okay, we've only been moving stuff up since monday, and it's been up and down those freaking stairs I don't know how many times with books shelves and beds and laundry baskets full of plates and food and blenders and more!  Not to mention that my previous bedroom now looks like a closet threw up on it - clothes everywhere.  I am definately going to have to do some weeding in that department because I don't think i can fit them all in my "quaint" new closetless bedroom.   And I still can't decide which door to leave and which one to put my bookshelf in front - the door leading to the kitchen (closer to the food and the bathroom), or the one leading to the living room (potentially a quieter way, closer to the front door) ...  any suggestions?  I am still enjoying my colour choice, and the few pictures I have put up go very well with it. (yay)  But it's late and I have to work, again, early...  so goodnight
