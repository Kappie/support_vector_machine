Only without the technology...      Y'Know what, Miss. V.? Never let Sarah and Teal'c talk about Star Wars. Ever. We'd be there for eternity.   On the other hand...Sarah, if Miss.V. ever does anything Go-Demonic...      I prefer the tech...you  know  exactly what its supposed to do and its reliable.      I'd offer to get some C4 for you, but Hammond would have my ass for it.                  "By the right, quick Bleah!!"- Cpl Mike, Fran, and Me      		    urlLink    Yahoo!
