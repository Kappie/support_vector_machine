From a jubilant feeling, it immediately turned into a frightened one. I dunno. I really dunno. I'm confused and afraid of the arrival of wednesday. How will she react? How. The horrible nightmares that haunt my dreams... What if...What if she dun wan to be friends anymore? Just over a bag? What if...What if she's mad at me? What if...so many 'what if's I really dunno...I'm so in despair. A joyous day can become this worried. I said I'll heck care but I just can't avoid thinking and my imaginations running wild. I can't concentrate on anything else... Since I've already bought the bag, I can't change the fact. It had been a year and I had never felt this regretful. Why though...why...I really dunno what to do.  I really dunno how she'll react...
