"If you buy a card for a woman, she's gonna think you planned it when really you just bought when you went to get some milk or something and like signed it at a red light. Just remember don't leave the receipt in the car, it's evidence. You never know, you might be in the car two minutes later and its 'You got this card  five  minutes ago! And you bought a butterfinger first you FATASS!'"  one word... genius
