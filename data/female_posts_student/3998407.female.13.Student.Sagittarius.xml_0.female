Probably an actress over a model because I love watching movies and I think playing in them would be even better! I dont think I am too good at acting though but there are schools for that! But being a model would be fun too because I love clothes and shopping! and my sister likes designing clothes! but i think she wants to be an interior designer or an architect though! but if i have no chance at being an actress or model i would like to be a dental hygeineist! that would be cool also! I also think it would be fun to do people's makeup! Just anyone of those four things! but people do say you can do whatever you set your mind to! and I would most likely want to be an actress or a model! ok welll im about to go! c ya l8er!   ~amanda~
