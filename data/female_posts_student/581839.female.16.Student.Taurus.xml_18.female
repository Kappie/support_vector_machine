Ok, i don't actually feel that bad. the only one of those emotions listed above that i am feeling is lonliness. i wish y'all were here spending the night which i am sure you will never be able to do which would make me really really sad. but don't worry about me, im sure i will get over it...eventually. ok i will move on to  a happier subject....if i can think of one....hmmm....i am having some trouble....well i was talking to bess...that was happy----------------------but then bess had to leave to go to dance class and hasn't gotten back yet. so i guess that makes me sad too. i rented a spongebob playstation game and it turned out to be the most boring thing i have ever experienced in my short, sad life.ok must think happy thoughts! mush think HAPPY thoughts!!ooo! ooo! i know i know! my happy thought is, i can talk to y'all tomarrow! yay! only about 12 hours to go!!!! tty in 12 hours!!!!
