Yesterday I rode on a tank, £5 which seems alot for a short ride but its well worth it! I have developed a new liking for tanks now. And Hummers. I love Hummers now. Hummers are basically like the jeep just ALOT bigger. You can see them in Black Hawk Down. This year they had a Iraqi tank there which drew a lot of interest. People come from all over to see the show, Dutch, French (pah!), German, even American! One day i hope to be involved somehow, maybe with my own vechiles. I wouldn't mind owning a  urlLink jeep  or  urlLink hummer  (big ol beasts!) when I'm older. Maybe ever a half track! Now  urlLink half tracks  really are nifty little things.
