I love the women trying to pretend like their problems are actually serious and how they infuse the deepest meaning and symbolism into even taking a shit.  For the past week or so, they have brought the women back to host re-runs of the old episodes. They gussie up these women with pancake make-up, rendering unrecognizable. I am also fairly convinced that they give them a good does of Oxycontin to give them that euphoric perma-smile.  The whole thing has a distinct Stepford-wives feel. It is as if these women go into the house and become robots...Which would make an infinitely more interesting show if they did. And they would call the show  Starting Over...As Robots! . Ah, if only...
