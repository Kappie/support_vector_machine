I was sitting in front of my desk doing some work, and leaned back in my not so comfortable chair. "Ahh, what a relatively quiet Wednesday afternoon," I thought and took a sip from my frothy cappuccino. Little did I know that within the next two seconds, my relative peace would be brutally shattered by the sound of cannons blasting in my immediate vicinity and angry sounding children running off aggressively to war.  It all started with a silent, seemingly harmless, fizz. I cocked my ears rather half-heartily, and quickly dismissed it, as it was just a fizz, and nothing unusual considering the weird things you can hear in this building. The sound didn't last too long, and just as I was getting comfortable again, it suddenly erupted into a loud bang that shook my windows, knocked my cappuccino off my desk, and made my retarded cat jump on my shoulders, nervously clawing at my jugular vein and scratching me bloody. "Holy shit!" I shouted while trying to pry the cat's claws out of my precious flesh. "We must be going to war!" I logically concluded, and jumped up whipping my hair around wildly for effect. I snuck a quick glance at my other cat, and saw her staring determined at the door. I could almost picture the miniature helmet on her head and tiny pistol at her waist.  I looked proudly at the little Belgian flag I carefully attached to the front door when I moved in, and saluted in a way that is difficult to describe, as I'm not a military woman, therefore don't really know how the Belgian army usually salutes. After collecting my weaponry, the trusty broom and long stick, I ran down the stairs, and when I arrived, the parking was abandoned. No sound could be heard, save for a small dripping noise and pretty much every single car alarm. Confused, I looked down and noticed remnants, not of a great and bloody battle, as I had anticipated with a perverse sense of joy, but of fireworks. I'm sure you wonder why someone had been stupidly lighting fireworks in broad daylight. Well, your guess is as good as mine. Mexicans never did make any sense to me.
