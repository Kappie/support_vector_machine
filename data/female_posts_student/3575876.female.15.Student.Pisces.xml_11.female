I decided whenever I feel bad about my body, I'll just head out somewhere or go to my garage to sing, dance or workout. That way, I'm busy. It's really funny, though. Whenever I feel bad about my body, I do the same thing I've done since last summer, even when I know it is wrong. I go and binge and then I feel worse so I drink a lot of water and I throw up and cry in the bathroom for a minute, then go on with my day like everything is fine. I'm going to stop. I stopped for a while, but I'm going to stop forever. I promised I would. I have to stop. It's just hard to sometimes. It's practically a habbit now, it's just not practical. He's going to be home on monday, and I'm really not doing well. He'll be disappointed.
