B+ Spiderman 2 (Special effects were amazing, butcomic book villains are a little overdramaticfor me and Kirsten Dunst's lines sucked.)    B How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (Matthew McCoughnohay--sp?-- is sooo beautiful, but the ending was really hokey)    B- I, Robot (Not the most intelligent of films. Given that, Will Smith is also beautiful, and so is his bare ass, which bumps this one up from a C) See  urlLink Aaron's rating  too.    More when I see Anchorman, Harold and Kumar go to White Castle, and The Terminal, among others.
