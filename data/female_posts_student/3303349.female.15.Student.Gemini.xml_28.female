She was acting like her old self and she was not being depressed and ranting over people in a California! And she's coming in August and I can drive then...ahhh...nirvana...not the band of course...good band...maybe I should say euphoria...big words...I love them....anyway...took my first schedualed final today. I already took one of two in my science class...because my teacher is evil...and that wonderful pacer test and mile that I was complaing about a few weeks ago is my final in gym...yeah so seven more to go... Uh huh...you gotta love finals :( . Isn't sock a funny word? Just thinking about that. Yeah well I've aparently run out of things to say so...au revoir...
