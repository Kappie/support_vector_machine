Of course Nick and Dyllan had some good coments on Anne being at my place Sunday by herself, and no one else. We all had a good laugh, except I turned all red. Then Dyllan and I took a walk and we had a good chat and I really enjoyed that.   Today was watetmania and that was pretty cool. I got to chill with Nellisa and we really don't talk much so that was pretty cool. Yep Yep  Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo looking forward to Canada Day. It's gonna be AWSOME!
