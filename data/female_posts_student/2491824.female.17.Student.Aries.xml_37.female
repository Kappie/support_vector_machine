It'll be called "The National Fund to Get Ashley a Snowboard"... :)   You should donate a bunch of money to it... It's a worthy cause, honest...  The reason I really want one now, as opposed to waiting until spring/summer when they will be cheaper, is that I'm sick of the rental boards and boots. The board suck because they've been abused so much. The boots are, of course, torn up and worn out, and they are too wide. My feet slip out (while going down the slopes!) no matter how tight they are tied... ....Plus when I tell the guys at the rental place what size board I want they ask me over and over if I'm sure I want that size ... Because it is a pretty big size (152, size being the length in centimeters) for someone of my height--it's eight inches taller than me...  ..Plus they don't even have 152s... So after a minute of so of them making sure that I really want a 152, they tell me I have to settle for either a 150 or a 154...   Bah...   I'm cold...
