Or does things really happen for a reason? Well in my case things really do happen for a reason. There are always lessons behind actions, and lessons that i have to learn at this time in my life, and God never fails with that. He shows me why everything the was it is, and to look beyond whats right in front of me, just by certain actions that take place in ordinary life. This lesson that i learned yesterday took place at church. And lets just say it really hit home.   The subject of the sermon yesterday was Seeing God as a Perfect Father, "perfection vs. reflection". Tom, our lead minister,(who is awesome by the way ;) ) gave this very heart-felt sermon which left me in tears from the beginning all the way to the end. Tom talked about how we all want and need our earthly father's blessing. We yearn for that. And in my case, i knew from that moment that i would be a wreck. We want our fathers love, blessing, active participation, and encoragement. We also want he's spoken belied in who we are and what will will become. Our Perfect Father is the Lord God himself. He is our real father. He makes up for everything our earthly father doesnt have. This is the reason why we have fathers. For the very reason. we need the love , we need the support, and we need their blessing. Its our very instinct that we rely on that blessing to get us through life, to build our self-esteem, to make us know that someone loves us and supports us through life. And when you don't get that blessing, life gets tough. And thats what happened to me.   A.W. Tozer states thats "the most important thing about a person is waht that person thinks about when they think about God." This is one of my standards that i live by. I try and put this into everyday life. Applying it to the people i meet and how i can change their view on the father himself. Show them what an awesome God He really is, and show them what he has done in my life alone, and show them what He can do in there life. Show them that the Lord is our Perfect Father, and that his love for us is endless beyond eternity.  "How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called the children of God! And that is what we are! the reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is."- 1 John 3:1-2  There are five types of Earthly fathers models. These models are similar but they have there own distinctive qualities. They are: The empowering father, the abusive father, the absent father, the possessive father, and the performances based father. They are basically self explanitory. My father was a mixture of all really. HE was more a abusive and performanced based father though. The performanced based father is when you have to live up to his standards in order to get his love and his blessing, and if you dont succeed at this, then you get the grunt, the cursing and the abuse. (This is so hard for me to write but i feel like i should be, so therefore i am.) You see my father was always like you show me you can do this, and ill give you my blessing. BUt if you screw up along the way your in for a nasty treat. And basically to him, my whole existence is a screw up. But Tom talked about that too. And he showed us that in the bible it actually says you are not accident, that the Lord planned our existence. Basically the core truth in Tom's words is that God is not the reflection of your earthly dad; he is the perfection of your earthly dad. God will always give me the love, the blessing, the forgiveness that im lacking from my earthly father. He will never frown upon nor be distant and angry with me. He knows you even before you were concieved. He made you. To me, this is what i had to hear. I had to know why. why was my father the way he was, why was i his supposive daughter, why did it always feel like it was my fault. Well i know now that all i need from my earthly father is everything i can get from my Perfect Father. I will still keep up everything im doing with my father(e.g calling him, trying to get him to listen to me if i can actually get a hold of him, that type thing..and eventually try and get him to God...it will be a challenge, but im up for it.)  "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened for you. For everyone who ask recieves; he who seeks finds; and to him that knocks, the door will be opened. Which of you, if his son ask for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he ask for a fish, will give him a snake? If you, then, though you were evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!"- Matthew  7:7-11  This whole sermon was soo overwhelming but i really, really needed it. I needed to know that the Lord was there for me,(i really dont know how to phrase that, but to me its sounds odd) and that it wasnt my fault for the way my fahter was. I needed to know that i was a punching bag for a reason, that there was all a reason for his madness. I needed that closure that i wasnt a screw up, and that i really am cared for. The qualities of a perfect father are; Everything a Perfect father says is   true. everything the perfect father does, is   right. Everything the perfect father hears, he   understands. Everything the perfect father promises, he   delivers on. The perfect father    isnt going anywhere. He will always always be there for you, no matter what. And not all dads are bad. Many of them fit the father profile. But there are many that don't. And there are reasons for that. Just remember the perfect father is always there, with open arms.   "even if my father and mother forsake me, the Lord will   recieve me." psalms 27:10. This passage was the one that hit home with me. It was the closure i needed to get through life. I will always always have that one in my heart. that is the verse that should be publicized around the world for all to hear, Because once i heard it, i knew that all would be alright, for a while. Tom's message really got me throughout the whole thing. He ended it with " The miracle today is that you can leave this place having a BETTER blessing- a blessing from a Perfect father."  Tom had found a "fathers love letter" online and used it in his sermon. It was a letter from God himself, straight from the bible. Its a "cry of a Father's heart from Genesis to Revelation". If you want to check it out go to www.FathersLoveLetter.com   There was really a hidden message in it too. Well for some, they didnt see it. But i saw it. I saw it because i think it was only there for me to see. I saw it because it was actually happening at the same time. And it stood out because of that. God purposely did it for me to recognize it. He wanted me to see that there was someone who physically cared for me and that loved me and wanted to be there beside me through my rough times. And I just want to thank her for staying with me, because believe it or not, shes helped  me keep my cool. Just that feeling of someone sitting next to you and caring for you, its calming. It showed me how much that one person cared, and i needeed it at that time. I know my mom or someone would have hugged me or something, but then i also now there would have been a smart comment that would have ruined the moment. And i just needed one of those long, long hugs that last for life, long after you let go. One of those reassuring its alright hugs/i know that was painful type hugs. I want to let that perosn know that i appreciate her for being there with me through my rough times and to let her know that she is cared for on the opposite end of the chain that bonds us together, and that if she ever needs to talk or just someone to listen that im there for that. She is truely loved for life, and not just by me, by many.   I hope this message gets out to all, and that those people who have that rotten relationship with there father, or jsut really need to hear that there is someone else out there that cares for you. God will always always be there for you, through all times. ever.    Loved by my father,   sam.
