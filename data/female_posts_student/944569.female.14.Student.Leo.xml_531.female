I mean, if you want us to use this blog to write about only certain things, please tell us. If you don't want us to rant about everything that we are going through ... well, please us know. And another thing.. who really cares about the people that read this blog? Isn't this blog for ourselves.. we aren't posting on this blog to please others.. are we? I'm getting a little confused here. Please someone, enlighten me. Nikki, I hope you don't take what i just said the wrong way.. I'm not trying to be mean or blame anything on you.. because it's no ones fault, or start and argument. I'm just kind of confused. I'm "expressing my opinion".
