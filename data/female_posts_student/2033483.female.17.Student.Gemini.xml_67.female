On Friday, I went to Lexi's open house and that was about it for that day.  Saturday was crazy! (hence then title) We had a bunch of people at our house over the weekend for my aunt's birthday party.  Saturday didn't really go how I planned it though.  I went to my cousin Ashley's open house earlier than my parents did so I could leave earlier.  I left for Liz's open house and I felt kinda bad cuz their wasn't alot of people at her's and I only stayed for about 15 minutes cuz I felt uncomfortable.  Then I came home and no sooner did I sit my tushy on the couch did Renae call me and soon we were off to more open houses.  After a quick stop at B to consult the map.  Alisha, Renae, and I were off on the search of Joe's house.  We found it and said hi and gave him his cards but left so we could make it to Logan's.  After Logan's open house we all went to our respectable homes.  Renae picked me up so we could go see the Spill Canvas show, but Alisha's mom wouldn't let her go on account of the Tornado warnings.  We were early so we sat in the parking ramp until we heard the sirens go off and then decided it would be better to be inside.  It scared the shit out of me when the drunk Indian was at the crosswalk bothering some people.  He HIT ME!  ASSHOLE DRUNK!  But the nice man that was there protected us.  We ended up sitting in the hall for an hour until the weather cleared up.  DAMN TORNADOES!  I'm not gonna say what I thought of the first three bands b/c they did not please me.  Finally, what I waited all day for, The Spill Canvas played!  I'm gonna miss 'em.  Joe was nutz on drums.  They played some new songs.  Afterwards, Renae and I had planned to go see Soulcreate too at Black Sheep.  So we get to the door and see that it's down pour rain outside.  Renae being smart says, "we're runnin'!" So we go.  I take two steps and my shoe falls off. I scream, "My shoe!"  Renae keeps runnin' and I go back for my shoe. I took the other one off and ran for it.  We were soaked and were laughing so hard when we got to the parking ramp we couldn't even stand up.  After hydroplaning it down 41st street we went to our homes.    Sunday was a good day.  Graduation was great.  Kate's speech was wonderful.  She sounded so confident up there.  I could have never done that.  I had fun at Kate's open house.  The bandos still freak me out and I think they always will.  Mrs. Newitt was there.  Yeah, that's right Renae, the devil was there.  lol.  Church was wonderful.  I love Alan's voice though, so as long as he's singing it is a good mass.    Monday...not much to report on.  Everyone went home and my house is now mine again!   Love ya, ~Kayla
