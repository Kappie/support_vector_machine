Nothing from M.. two jokes from Robin and a question from Amy. I've been up a few hours and I'm ready to fall back to sleep. I'm so tired. I'm going to rest in the chair and watch t.v. for awhile. I thought if I ate it would help but it didnt. Kids are up except Tony but he stayed up until 4 letting me sleep on the couch. Poor kid. I'm feeling ok just ugh.. ya know. my head feels full, I feel dizzy but I feel ok. I wonder if it is some kind of viral infection (viral or whatever it is called) lab work all came back fine except thyroid well hello I knew that but that wouldnt make me feel this way.   Joey wrote a harsh letter to his ex girlfriend. They are / were still friends and each time he said something about another girl she got all upset but she could talk about her new boyfriend all she wanted. Joey basically told her that he wasnt going to bow down to her anymore and that she was acting like a slut. He said something about them having sex in the letter and she was so upset that she showed it to her mom Lol. Her mom didnt know that they had sex. She's not mad at Joey but is mad at the daughter. Joey at least came clean about it. Other then that. Tony is starting another cycle I think.. He's not in the best of moods but he doesnt know what is wrong. I personally think it's stress.. I would give anything to have the stress off these kids for awhile.   Joey was also suspended from school for the rest of the year.. Long story but basically a kid was yelling in his ear after several times of asking the kid to stop and the teacher knowing this the kid screamed in his ear again (he had a headache already) and then said "what gonna hit me" so Joey did not hard just smacked him. Nothing happened to the kid.. I swear I hate this school.. Ok i'm going to go rest..
