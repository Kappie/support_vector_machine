I didn't go anywhere, do anything, was barely on the computer at all. Today I have felt like crap. I have been dizzy and light headed all day. I went in for physical therapy, but didn't finish it all. When I got home, in the mail I found the letter from SSI finally. The day has gone down hill from there. I knew I was going to be denied. I don't have a problem with that at all. I am no longer disabled! I am happy that I am no longer disabled! I want to be able to take care of myself. BUT! I can't get any straight answers out of the SS department about what the bottom line of my status is. The paperwork sent me today said that I was a possible canidate for continued benefits under the 301 program. But in another place it said that I AM elegible for continuation under the 301 program. I went in to talk to someone about it. I called twice about it. No one can tell me for sure if I will have an interuption in benefits or not. I HAVE to know and beable to provide documentation so I can have my HUD refigured and apply for food stamps. Between this, my bank account and Aarons, the problems with getting my Voc Rehab vouchers in, and waiting for my Pell money to come, I'm about to go nuts!
