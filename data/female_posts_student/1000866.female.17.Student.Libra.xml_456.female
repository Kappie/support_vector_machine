I stopped at Gap and got the COOLEST pair of pants ever. Seriously I LOVE them. Ah, they're so soft and comfy and...AH! I love them. Haha, I don't usually get that excited over clothes but...these pants are the coolest. Plus, they're black which is awesome because black is an amazing color...err...not really a color but that's ok.  I'm really excited for Michigan. Of course, I'm only going for like...48 hours. I think I'll bring, The Great Gatsby to read in the car. Woo. Wow...I just realized that there's a spell check on this thing. That's exciting. I could use that. It says I spelled comfy wrong. Possibly because comfy isn't a word...  I hope Bryan had fun seeing, "The Producers." I really really want to see it. He's so lucky. I'm kind of bummed I'm not going to get to spend any time with him this weekend at all but it's ok. Possibly next weekend.   I wonder how the game went. I feel bad for not going, but it really wouldn't have made a difference had I gone. Nathan and Peter were there, and they're both strong players so I'm sure it's fine. Plus, I would have just been getting home now probably and I NEVER would have had time to do all the stuff I needed to.  Haha, today in Wind Ensemble, it was kind of funny. All of a sudden Dave says, "Wow, we are the worst trumpet section ever," and I realized he was completely right. He was like, "I'm sitting here not even playing, Peter's reading the newspaper, Norkus is doing..I don't know what the Hell Norkus is doing (I was wrting a note to Carson) and Dan is...just Dan." I don't know, it just made me laugh, especially hearing that from Dave of all people. Haha.   OK, I need to go get sleep. I'm leaving in lilke, 5 hours. Blahhhhh. I want the car ride to be done with. I wish I had a private jet so I could just fly there.
