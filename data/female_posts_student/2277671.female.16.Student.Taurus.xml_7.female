YOU MADE ME HAPPY YOU ARE THE BESTEST EVER!!      So here is the essay I wrote.... chaa.....   Dark and Hazy   	  A place where no one can go, and where no one can see. Dark, and hazy, it is a part of me. Thoughts racing, hurt and confusion, full of tension and no relaxation.  	In my dreams, a haven, colors, pretty pictures, good thoughts and happy times. Sometimes it makes me smile, and sometimes cry, a place to go, it is always there, guiding me toward wrong and right, always putting up a fight. In a state of euphoria, I am happy, nothing can bother me. Sad, crazy and funny thoughts. Images of little, big and scary people.  It is full of ideas of the future, memories of the past and warm feelings of the present.  	It holds my inner darkest secrets and does not tell a soul, except for my own. When I am down, this place can either keep me down or lift me up. Through good and bad, it will be there, as if it were a hand to hold, warm and soft, or hard and cold, depending on the mood. 	Sandy beaches with splashing water and pretty sunsets with  different colors, purples, pinks and different shades of blue. A dark dungeon with long dim lighted chandeliers and spikes coming from the walls, giving off a Closter phobic feeling. Suffocating and paralyzing every part of your body, giving you watery eyes, and bloody tears.  	It can bring smiles of happiness and tears of sadness. Not caring how you feel, good or bad, it controls your emotions. It changes your mood and attitude without notice. Others do not  know how this is for me, but they know what I am talking about. That one place that is always there, a place to get away, or a place to be trapped. Where no one can bother you.  It can be your best friend, or you worst enemy. At times, it can be a cruel place that gives you negative thoughts and leads you to a bad emotional state.               Lately, this place has served as a personal prison for me; it is not helping me sort out any of my problems. It is dark and cloudy, full of teary rain puddles. There is no escaping this place, for only it can change itself and set me free.       M Success comes easily to you.    O You are very open-minded on your mind.
