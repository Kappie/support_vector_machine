I forgive you for beating on me after I accidentally knocked your folder on the floor, spilling all the alphabetized papers. No matter how much I apologized, you continued to beat me senseless. I still have the scars. Also, don't forget my manliness.  This sentence has no meaning. Nor does this one.  Pointless space  And they lived happily ever after. THE END?                                555-9897*                 Cheech"   Today, in school, I passed around my yearbook to various friends of mine. Although I only have about 10 signatures at this point in time, I think that out of this year (and all other years of my schooling which are very many) that this was the best thing anyone has ever written in my yearbook. It's riddled with many somewhat pointless inside jokes and makes light of the situation at hand. The school year is over, he wants me to call him...but that's also another inside joke for another day's explanation.   *Number changed for privacy.     By the way...                                   +The End+                                +For the moment+
