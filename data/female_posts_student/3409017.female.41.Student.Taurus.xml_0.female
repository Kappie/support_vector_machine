My own mother passed December 29, 2001 at the age of 72.5 years to the day.  Finding her body was the most shocking, confusing, frightening and ultimately the saddest thing I have ever experienced.  It's an experience that has affected me in ways so profound I will save them perhaps for a later publishing.  Grandma and Grandpa spent MANY years gather information about our family tree.  My mother gladly inherited the task with great zeal.  After my grandparents passings, my extended family had begun to drift apart as I suppose most familys do every few generations.  My older sister who does not have children and I with one teenage daughter are my mothers only current desendants.  After her passing, I inherited the dozens of 3-ring binders compiled over the years about our ancestors.  My home is small with little storage and as I am currently on disability with some time on my hands I decided to retype and/or scan in all the information and burn it to disks for safe keeping in a firebox in case my house burns down or is blown away by a tornado.  I do live in Kansas after all!  My mother's name was even Dorothy!  Initially I started scanning thinking this would be faster, but soon realized much of the info had been copied from copies from copies.....leaving the quality very poor.  So I gudgingly endevored to retype most of the documents.  I don't know if anyone in the family will be interested in having copies, but I figured I could at least brush up on my typing skills in anticipation of returning to work at least part time.  Little did I know how facinating the history of my very typical, in many respects, family ancestors would be.  Stories that tell of immigration, farming in the newly opened west, adventures of daily living.  I find myself typing faster just so I can find out what the next story is about.  I hope after the CD's are burned, others will be interested in reading our history.  I'd hate for 50 years of work by my grand parents and mother to fade into obscurity.  Perhaps a time capsule.........hmmmmmmmmm.
