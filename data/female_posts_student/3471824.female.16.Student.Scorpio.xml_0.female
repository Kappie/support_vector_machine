It's not THAT good a game anyways- there's so many out there that are far better- and it's rigged. Rigged games suck. Especially when it's rigged against you. I'll NEVER become an Immortal, even if I do reach level 50 someday! And it's because of that little @#*ing b#^ Saskii! If I ever became an immortal, she'd whine and complain about not being one (she's been bugging magden for longer to become one) and if she becomes an immortal, chances are she'd kill me. Repeatedly. In the game, of course. But it's no fair! I've been working so HARD helping newbies and such, and Az, who never does anything but CHAT, just became one! I could scream for all eternity. What's the point of working to become a level 50 (and an automatic immortal) if I wouldn't be permitted to become one anyways!?
