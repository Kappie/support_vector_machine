I guess everything needs to happen once in life.   It has been snowing all day today. But it's not staying on the ground. I hope this is our last snow storm of the winter. School is ok. I have been doing better in Psychology but i have been doing worst in French. Hopefully i can bring up my mark on the next test. Other then that there is nothing new. So i will go for now. Have a good weekend!
