However, there is a quote about halfway through the article (scroll down if you don't believe me) that struck me as rather odd:   Byron Conway, 27, of Milwaukee, said Kerry was the only candidate with a shot at beating Bush. "I just want him out," he said.   Barbara Chamberlain, 79, also of Milwaukee, backed Edwards for the same reason. "I have hope for him beating you-know-who," she said.    You-know-who ??  Is Bush really so evil that Democrats can't bring themselves to say his name?  I think this lady needs to get a grip.
