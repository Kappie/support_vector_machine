Now just to find out about him...  Anyway, the letter was absolutely amazing.  They McLemores are sub-human if they don't accept that as appropriate apology.  I'll get it back to you tomorrow so you can send it.  I hope you don't mind, but I let my mommy read the letter, and she says that you should send it and that the McLemores will understand that people make mistakes, but that you have breached their trust and that this is a good step toward fixing it.    So there you go.
