And now I'm wondering if it was worth the sacrifices I made?  B is having the time of his life.  We're on speaking terms, and the animosity, or most of it anyway, seems to have faded.  We had a "date" on Saturday, ie: he picked me up, we had dinner, then we went to a movie.  Granted, he spent the night, but it's been five years, and we've been apart two weeks, and we don't need any damn excuse.  (Though, it wasn't make-up sex.  Just really, really good sex.  I don't think we've resolved anything together, though we've made leaps and bounds as individuals.)  He said to me, last night on the phone, "It's been kind of fun for the past couple of weeks, acting like I'm -- no offense -- a single guy.  It used to baffle me when Chris would say he only sees April on weekends, but now I get it."  "Yeah," I agreed.  "It can get to be a little bit much.  Seeing each other everyday is a lot, and it's not bad, but it means that then there's no room for much else."  So he's having a good time.  He said he's hanging out with his friends tonight, a description I found to be wholly non-descript.  I figure it's probably either code-talk for hanging out in "mixed company" or he's trying to make me think that's what's happening.  "Just as long as you're okay with that.  'Cause of course, if you  weren't  ok with it, you really couldn't get mad.   Ahem ."  Yeah, thanks Mommy, always with your words of wisdom.  Damn you...  But no, I wouldn't be upset if he was hanging out with chicks.  Besides, whatever he's doing, he's being very subtle, so that's ok too.  I trust him not to do anything to purposely hurt me.  Accidental hurt, well, that's just a part of life I guess.  So, we're not together, we're not apart...we're just...on a break, I guess.  I can still tell him I love him, we still exchange "baby", and we still talk, almost every day.  I saw him Saturday for our date.  Sunday for a rented movie, then Monday for shopping before I went to Quannum.  And it's good.  Who knows what will happen in the next weeks, who knows what will be said when we actually sit down to talk.  But right now, things are good, and I feel like I can exhale.
