When I wanna blog? No. That's wrong, I'm sorry.  Dangerous is my name, I live for the adventure that only you can bring.  I spent the night at Liam's last night. Mom almost blew a gasget, and finally, after talknig to his mom let me. As I turned off the TV after watching the most amazing infomercial, it hit me: I spent New Year's at Ash's. And I was even going out with him. And she never ever questioned it....  I have no conscienous anymore. I'm serious. What I have done in the past week would make normal people cry, or confused. Me? I laugh it off. And try to improve it. If it's there, it only eggs me on. I need something, or someone, to stop me. Fast. So that I get ahold of myself.  I'm looking at maybe....2, 3 certain guys when I say that.
