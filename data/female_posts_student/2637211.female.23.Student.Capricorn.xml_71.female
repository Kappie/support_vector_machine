I spent all of Monday writing my 3 papers, spent Tuesday morning finishing them, spent the day going to classes and turning the papers in, then came home in time to register for classes next quarter (equals cold sweats about my future). After I finished that, I decided/felt guilted/wanted to go to Oakland on Tuesday night because Jerm is spending the weekend in Irvine visiting with Jason. Then, Wednesday was a rush out to Stockton, then hang out and chat with Dad day, then drive home with Jerm having panic attacks (which happens when he doesn't eat) about how he was never going to get all of his tasks done before Thursday. We went to Pleasanton Safeway (which is almost like a costco--gas and everything), and watched two annoying yuppie ladies have a traffic dispute waiting in line for the gas station, one an older lady in a tan Volvo, the other a very well-dressed lady with crazy eyes in a Mercedes suv. They honked a bunch at each other, as the lady in the suv tried to cut in front of the lady in the Volvo. Then the suv stormed away, presumably to park. Then the suv lady walked up to the Volvo lady and told her something (we had our windows open to eaves-drop, but couldn't hear), and the Volvo lady completely ignored the suv lady. Then she saw Jerm and I watching the drama, and looked exasperated. It was awesome. Then we saw the lady in the grocery store, and she was buying healthy choice frozen dinners and wine. Interesting, right? It's almost as good as reality television...oh wait, maybe there's a reason people love reality television, because since we've closed ourselves off from our neighborhood gossip and intrigue, it's our only avenue towards satisfying our inner voyeur. Oh, and I came home this morning and realized I have another paper to write, a ton of reading, and I forgot my essential toiletries in Oakland, so I may well spend the evening driving to and from Oakland. I'm tired of it all, and can't wait for some restfulness... I forget this thing is so public, because I have some scathing analysis of some of the people in my life, but it's never good to publicly display short-term annoyances in a long-term friendship. Or in the case of family, they'll just make your life miserable for a while if you cross them. Oh well, off to school work.
