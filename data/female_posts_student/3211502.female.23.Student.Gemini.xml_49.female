Unlike its predecessor, this movie wasn't very good. It wasn't even good enough to make it into the movie theaters (and we all know that some sucky movies still make it that far). Instead, this sequel went straight to video/DVD.  And, rightfully so. It was horrible. The plot had some hope, but the dialogue and the acting was horrendous. Some classic lines include: "Make like a Tom and Cruise," "He was all over you like ugly on an Osbourne," and "If you put make-up on a pig, it's still a pig."  What a waste of film.
