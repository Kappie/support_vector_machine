French tres facile (and i suck @ french) then there was Math, oh sweet jesus that was sooo hard... it took me the full 3 hrs, im such a fuck up! I was ready to cry in the middle b/c i had no energy left, like my brain literally hurt. But now im sitting @ home b/c i cant do ne thing 2night b/c i have another regents tomorrow. I'm pissed off b/c i wanted to go to the mall w/ Dani, Tory, and Dave but I cant b/c my parents wont let me... not that it makes a difference Im gonna go to bed @ like 2 wherever i am and no studying is gonna get done so theoretically i should b able to go to the mall and enjoy myself after a hard days work but thats my parents for me... that's wht i get for being in accelerated classes... a really shitty schedual. U'd think b/c were smart they would give us this nice schedual where we get all the tests over w/ after the 1st week and we have the whole next week off but noooooo they just cant handle that they have to make it really long and spread out...and NO Parties, I miss middle school... Just Kidding!!! Well yeah i think u know how i feel about the shitfaces who make these fucking regents in the 1st place so no need 2 elaborate...Time for me to go and find other ways to keep myself sain b4 ppl go online 2night, oh ino ill straighten my hair if u care... well yea, later!!!
