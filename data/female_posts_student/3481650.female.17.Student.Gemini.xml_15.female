This week has been sucking, because I've realized how little time I get to spend with my brothers. Ross has a girlfriend, who he spends every waking moment with. We usually joke about it, but lately it just makes me feel like I'm missing out. Mark too, with Sara. It's the same way. And my sister Amy has a boyfriend, a job, and they're both working on their house constantly.  I practically never see her. My dad is always at work, or when he's home he's watching TV/ in a bad mood because of work, or sleeping. My mom...is usually pretty busy doing errands, sleeping, or working on the sunroom floor. Me. I just feel so unwanted lately, except for church stuff. It makes me excited for school starting. I got to page 337 on Owen Meany today. I hope I can get completely done by Friday. As for me never having anything really important to do, I thought for a second that I could go with my dad to his work, and then remembered that I'm the dainty one who can never do any real work. I also spilled my root beer earlier taking the cap off. That's it.
