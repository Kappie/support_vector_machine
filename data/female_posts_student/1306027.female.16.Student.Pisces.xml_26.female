It all started with the weekend     -Saturday  A relatively agitating day. My dad had the weekend off because of his business-sponsored trip to Texas beginng on Monday. My whole family got up and got ready to leave for Walmart and OldNavy. But what actually happened, was my brother, who's birthday was near, felt it was time to receive his birthday present at that moment and preceded to drag us all over town trying to find an Xbox steering wheel. By the time we reached OldNavy, all of us were on our last nerve. I wanted to go driving(Hello- 50 hour slip..) and my brother was whining because he had a new Xbox steering wheel that he had to try out within the next 20 mins or he would just die. My father didn't feel like being out at all and wanted to be drove home too. The day ended ok though, I got to drive and Dad and Alex got to go home. Mom finished it off by taking us to see a movie about alien space dogs(Good Boy).    -Sunday  Went to church, went to B, studied for the psats. It was a relatively uneventful day. Ended it by watching alias.    -Monday  Monday was a really hard day for me. It started semi-early in the morning. My family all jumped in the van and wisted off towards the airport. For those of you who don't know, my dad has never been away.. like ever. The whole time we were waiting I was choking back waterfalls. When the time finally came to say goodbye, I lost it and cried the whole way home. I don't know what I was really emotional about- maybe it was just that I had a lot to deal with in the coming week and it would have been better to have him home. My mom sensed my distraught and stayed home. I had the psats on Tuesday, and I was panicking big time. My mom bought dinner and studied with to the point where I thought my brain would crack. I went to bed at 1:30 with red eyes and an unsure feeling.   -Tuesday  I can't say that I really "woke up" cause I really didn't sleep. My mom bought me breakfast and sharpened my pencils. We left the house relatively early and got there early. We traveled to several rooms inquiring about the psats and were directed to the wrong room- then to another wrong room, and then to the right room. I sat with my pencils and my calculator waiting for the test. And then it was over. Done. Just like that. Scores will be back in December.    -The rest of the week  A blur, It really didn't matter. My dad came back Friday. And that's it. Kinda boring huh?
