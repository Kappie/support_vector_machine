I'm sorry but I wouldn't go stay at a friends house for HIS birthday! ARG fuck... I was having such an awesome day too... i got like a new necklace and make-up and shit and hung out with my friend and it was like awesome and then he has to to to tell me that he is not going to be there for my birthday... like SERIOUSLY! arg stupid ppl.  On the bright side... to that I FAILED MY SOCIAL TEST! yay... not..... this day sucks balls. And then on top of that... i WAS going to go see chad this evening but I have to go visit my mom which isn't bad at all but I'm also apparently going to my dad's friends house for supper like we did just last week... I don't wanna. This day totally sucks... I just wanna go like curl up in a ball and sleep... cry do anything... I DONT KNOW I wasnt to get away from here... Its not that bad but I just wanna go on vacation or something.   We saw our french sub who was like our sub for like 3 months today coming out of our school and we said hi to him. And yeah like I said we we being our entire class failed the social provincial... I mean with Mrs. Lowe... she didn't teach us anything except shit about Rasputin and there wasn't ANY questions on him... I mean we studied him for like 5 months out of ten... thats all we did... learned about Rasputin... HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CURRICULUM! oh well I don't really care... if was worth marks but...meh  Me and my friend were shopping and I was waiting for her to get sumtin and ther was this guy... and yeah he was lets just say "adjusting" himself and yeah it was funny.  Okay so I have another story.  We were in this park and just sitting there and this guy came along and I was like HI and then he layed down on a bench and I said HAVE A GOOD SLEEP and yeah he kinda waved and yeah... anyways theres these two sets of slides with 2 slides each and they're like 4 meters apart or sumtin... anyway me and my friend were laying on one of the sets of swings and then he came over and layed down on one of the other slides that was in the other set and yeah so we got kinda freaked and we walked away but before we did I was like BYE and then he said peace out but i didnt understand him so I was like... WHA? lol and he said it again and I still didn't understand but I just asked Melissa (my friend) what he said and yeah thats my story.  Oh and my brother was talking to someone but anyways apparently one of his friends whos in grade 5... like 4 years younger than me thinks im "good looking" except my brother said he actually said I'm hot... I was like EW thats not normal... but yeah.  Oh and I don't think I said... 2 months today! for how long Chad and I have been going out for... that time went by really quickly... especially the last month... jusy like WHOOSH and its gone... that time again and it'll be 3 months.... wow and its less than a month till my b-day right now which is even better.... even tho chads not going to be there.... oh well
