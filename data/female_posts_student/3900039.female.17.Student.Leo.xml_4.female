But I noticed shoes and a pillow and some odd placed things....so I kept calling him and there was no answer, so I went downstairs to his room and there was the boy and his dog fast asleep. It was one of the all time cutest things I've ever seen. He woke up shortly and I switched his laundry for him. Court and I swam and when we came back in Quentin had arrived. Then Court and I went to get ice cream(and to see Bryan oh so cute). Christina showed up at Collin's while we were gone and called to ask for ice cream too and it was a bad mess....we had so much ice cream all over the car, just a huge sticky melting mess, and then we didn't get Quentin any and I was afraid he would be upset, but he seemed fine(we are on good terms, I'm glad). Kaitlin also came over and Collin had a mini-reunion with all us. Then I sent him back off on his way to Portland with Mindy to catch a flight to Colorado for a family reunion. I seriously haven't seen him hardly at all, but he will be back for good in a week. Thank goodness... I'm having major Collin withdrawls....which is probably why I'm at his house with out him and we will prolly have a party here tonight. well not a party...more like a get together with the gang to swim and have a fire haha! So I'm going to jump in the pool now.
