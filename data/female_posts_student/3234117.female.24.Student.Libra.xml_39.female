Of course it would be my luck that I pick a place like this. I wouldn't have even known until my dad called me and told me the psychologist called him and told my dad the news. My dad approves/denies procedures for this clinic and several others so luckily the psychologist was able to get ahold of him to let me know. I don't know the whole story as I just heard that part from my dad.  This is great. Fortunately it is still early and I have some time to look. I wasn't dead set on going to this clinic as I still had some other options and I still do. I'm just waiting for my professor to contact them. You can bet that my professor will be getting an email of urgency to do so. Hopefully my dad has some other connections and I've also found some other places outside of the pain and rehabilitation field.   At least I got a new dress and the classy look for my interviews. I plan on checking out the Denton MHMR this week and maybe something will come out of that. Although I wouldn't be too thrilled to have to drive on I-35 three days a week. I guess it wouldn't be so bad if I decided to take some extra classes at UNT.  Speaking of, I've decided I'm going to be in school my whole life. I didn't realize, but after internship, residency or a post doc fellowship is an option. After or maybe simultaneously is another post doc in psychopharmacology so I can prescribe psychotropic medicine. Provided that Texas passes and implements the law, but I can't say for sure I'll even be living in Texas. That post doc is two years. I also have been thinking of getting my J.D. I know you think I'm crazy, but it would allow me to be an expert in forensics or other things. My dad is an expert witness and let me tell you, the pay is not too shabby. Who know's if I'll actually do this. It's a minimum ofthree years away. I doubt my parents would be too happy to know they'll be supporting and paying for my education for many more years. Although my father wasn't self sufficient until he was in his lower thirties with all the schooling he did. Everyone says I'm young and now is the time to be in school so I might as well. I'm not very competitive though so I don't know about law school. A few of us are thinking of doing it and from what I've heard, U of H is very diversified and would be a good place. I don't know. We'll see. It's fun throwing out my options and seeing all the paths I could take.  Okay now for some ice cream.
