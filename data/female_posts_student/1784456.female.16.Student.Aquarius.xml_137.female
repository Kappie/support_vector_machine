Oh I'm at home cause I'm ill. :( On Saturday I was really week and tired all the time, then on Sunday I hit my arm and went downstairs to get some arnica (don't ask) and I blacked out and fainted. Apparently I hit my head really hard, then when I woke up I kind of had some spasms or some thing? I was actually really confused and I didn't know who I was or who my parents were! Took a few minutes to remember. Today I feel dizzy and sick. Healthy huh? My mum thinks I've got a bug. Hmm, if I go to school tomorrow Laura should get it and I'll be fine...good...good. Mango isn't being very nice. My right leg looks like a scratching post and it really hurts. He scratched my big toe and it hurts. :( (Grr stupid cat...) Broadie was too, but Cleo was purring so loudly that I couldn'y hear the tv! Have a healthy day.
