So when I woke up, I felt really horrible. I spent today reading through all of my posts making sure I didn't allude to a hatred of any kind toward Lucas or anybody else. I just want everyone to know that I don't hate anybody, regardless of how angry I seem to get. Sure, I used to hate my sister Rachel, but I realize that she's probably the way she is because of a hormone problem or something. She's probably really depressed and I don't blame her. I mean, she IS going out with Scott Lord, but I digress and lie. Scott's not that bad, he's just boring, and it really doesn't matter if he reads this because he already knows that's what I think. I've decided they probably mesh so well because Rachel's always talking and talking and talking and Scott never says anything. So Scott doesn't care that she's infinitely gabbing, as long as he doesn't have to say anything. So anyway, I just want to let it be known that I don't hate anyone, no matter how raged I appear to get.
