Let's see, Friday night me and Justin rented You Got Served. On the way back from the video store, we got served. There was this medical vehicle so he swerved out of the way and hit the right side mirror on something on the side of the road. So...the mirror part shattered and i had to hold it the whole way back to my house, where we duck taped it back on. Anway, the movie was ghettolicious. "Chatta chatta chit chit!" Haha i
