I was worked! It was kind of like working on my train set, but way more effort. As originaly though, time crawled and I couldn't wait until I was done! Now it's back to work at the Stadium. It wasn't too bad. I was still so tired from work with Dave though. Anywho, today was really a Monday, it really didn't feel like Sunday! Oh Yeah, I'm not traumatized Nelly!!! I just can't believe I'm missing out on this "life changing week". Anywho...  Day 2: Complete Status: Hard!! Physicaly demanding!!
