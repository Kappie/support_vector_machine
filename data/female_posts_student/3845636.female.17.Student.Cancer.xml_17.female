I can only depend on my antibiotic... my flu medicine may cause drowsiness, therefore I can only take it before going to bed. ahaha~ or else... I may just doze off anytime during lessons. arrgh... it's irritating to be sick. You sneeze all day long as though your nose is gonna fall off anytime. teRrible man~ spoil my mood sia. Anyway.... everybody out there must take good care wor... now adays it's a crazy trend to fall sick easily. Life is very unpredictable... so do treasure your own self and the people around you. By treasuring yourself will already be doing a good favour to your love ones! so ... that's all. My head's spinning... haha.. wait till I get better... there will be more bloggy updates to come.
