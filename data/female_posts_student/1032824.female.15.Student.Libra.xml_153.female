It's Tiff from  Bardot ! After the group splitted up, she pursued her solo career like what Katie and Sophie did, and they're all doin really well! I'm anticipating Belinda and Sally's comeback. So here it is,  urlLink Tiffani Wood 's debut single, "What R U waiting 4?"! I've been waiting for this moment since forever! :P        What R U Waiting 4    (Matthew Gerrard / Bridgit Benenate / Steve Brooker)     Verse 1  Sometimes I get that overwhelming feeling So sad the faces on TV If I tried to make a difference would it help anyway and then I stop and to myself I say   Chorus  So you wanna change the world What r u waiting 4? Say you're gonna start right now What r u waiting 4? It only takes one voice so come on now and shout it out Give a little more What r u waiting 4?   Verse 2  Sometimes I feel a little helpless Seems like I can't do a thing But anything is possible, just you wait and see Good things happen if you just believe   Chorus    Middle 8  Someday, Somehow Gonna take that step Cause time is ticking away Right here, right now Before it's too late Gonna face tomorrow today  What r u, what r u waiting Waiting, what r u waiting 4?
