My politics final went surprisingly quick, and I feel like I got at the least a B.  I don't know... I don't need much to maintain a B, and if I got an A then I most likely got an A in the class.  I don't know if I made the Dean's List.  I'll let ya'll know... but I had to pull an A in either my Politics or Education class (instead of the high B I had in each class).  I don't know if I did that, because I only really studied enough to maintain the grades that I had... as opposed to trying really hard to make an A on the final and in the class.  I'll be happy with 3 A's and 2 B's, to be quite honest.  Okay, what else am I happy about?  This time tomorrow, I'll be soaking up the sun in Port Aransas, TX... playing lotsa guitar, bumming around, and just getting in a good week long vacation before I search for a job and then have summer classes the months of June and July.  Zack may come this summer for a visit, which will be quite interesting... :-)  Oh, some creepy guy from sims online sent me a message.  BLECK!  Yeah, and I think that Joe may have called me last night like, 3 times in a row.  I  think .  I dunno, I hope not, but he ran into my Mom on Weds. at Wal-Mart... so I wasn't all that surprised when I got several phone calls from a blocked number.  Ya know what I hope?  I hope he decides to give me my stuff back... and my Mom thinks that I should call his mommy and ask her to get onto him about it.  I don't think it's too much to ask.  I just don't want him to have things sitting around that carry my name on them, because then he may get the brilliant idea (in one of his fits of self-pity) to gimme a call and play "sad Joe" trying to get sympathy.  Sympathy which I don't have the time or want to give him.  Ever.  The only other time I want to have anything to do with him is to get my stuff back... and then that's it.  I don't care anymore... and I have lots of non-loser people to give the time of day to.  People that actually care about me, and people whom I regard more as family than just friends.  They know who they are...  Okay, well, I don't feel like posting much else, because I still have to take a shower and such... getting ready for that damned fashion show I'm modeling in tonight... yuck!  I don't feel like it... but it should be fun... Jamey's in it with me... we always have fun together... ; )  hehehe  I dunno... if Ricky wants to call and inquire about whether or not we're engaging in a wrestling match in a salad dressing filled pool... hehehe... go right on ahead.  It's no worse than asking me and Christine if we were finger painting each other when we were painting a backdrop for our play.  hehehe  :-D  Okay, kiddies... I probably won't update again til after I get back from Port A.  But, we'll see... my Uncle Scott will probably bring his laptop, and I think we'll have web access in the condo.  Bye bye til I'm back...
