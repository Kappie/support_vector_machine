Working to much but its giving me a lot of money. I need to get $3000 by the end of the summer to pay for school. Student loans is not giving me much this year. Oh well 2yrs then i will be done my BA. I am training a new girl this weekend. She is doing well. I hope this person decides to stay. I have to work both shifts tomorrow. Its going to be a long day!  Nothing much in my life is going. Don't have any time to go out. I am just working too much and working 7 days evert week. I had yesterday off the only day that i have off in the last three weeks. Well i have to go. I have a few things to do before going to bed. Have a nice day!
