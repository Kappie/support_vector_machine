"Slipped Away"    I miss you, miss you so bad I don't forget you, it's so sad I hope you can hear me I remember it clearly  The day you slipped away Was the day I found it won't be the same   I didn't get around to kiss you Goodbye on the hand I wish that I could see you again I know that I can't  I hope you can hear me cause I remember it clearly  The day you slipped away Was the day I found it won't be the same  I had my wake up Won't you wake up I keep asking why And I can't take it It wasn't fake It happened, you passed by  Now your gone, now your gone There you go, there you go Somewhere I can't bring you back Now your gone, now your gone There you go, there you go, Somewhere your not coming back  The day you slipped away Was the day I found it won't be the same The day you slipped away Was the day that i found it won't be the same   I miss you   I remember talking to Yasi yesturday. I said that I got teary because I read the email again. I didn't mean to. You know when you delete mail it goes to the next mail. That's when i read it. I don't know what's wrong with me, really. I guess it's the fact that, I believed in everything so easily. Some people say, just ignore everything he said because it was all lies. I'm thinking it now. He never loved me. Yasi said that I loved him but he didn't. I guess she's right. I was half way walking home with Nima. Well, we met each other when we were pratically at our houses. We were just talking about him and Joey. I remember at the end of the day, Nima gave the polar bear with a rose to Joey. It was so sweet. She was really happy. Jacqueline thought they were going to kiss. I just laughed. I walked home really fast today. Before I was with Nima. Safee, Anoosh, and Jordan were ahead of me, but I went first. I was speed walking pratically. I wanted to go to the pond, but it was too hot. I just noticed that I could see it from my room.  I watched Lord of the Rings, Return of the King, and there was one saying Frodo said around the end of the story. It was about life, the past, present, future. He said that once something happens, you can't go back. Of course, he says this because of his experiences with the Ring. For me, I would say it's about everything. But Frodo said, all you could do is keep on going. He's right, that's what I'm going to do.
