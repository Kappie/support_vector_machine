He showed me this morning and it looks like the top of his middle finger peeled apart. Anyway, the reason Ian isn't posting this himself is because he was on his way to FYE to buy some music. Plus Ian has that baseball game to go to tonight, so he asked me to post about it for him. If you haven't noticed yet, Ian is talking to me again.
