Met 2 years ago at Delia's place! We all had a sleepover together at Delia's and stuff. Went to Elbert (who was sleeping in Delia's room) and woke him up... but he was too sleepy to go eat ice-cream with us. Haha! Good times! Chris broke up again. *sighzZ* Poor kid. He's cool, but I don't know why he keeps getting dumped! Maybe he should go for Ingrid! LoLzZ~!  Jay talked to me a while before and asked if I was going to Bethel but I told him I couldn't. Had to babysit my sister. Bah humbug!   Nima was last seen at the park. I miss him... We talked about going outside today after school but yeah. Forgot about it. Whatever. I think he's with Jordan. Blahh.  Haha! Alice is so funny! "la" LMAO~! So yeaah. Hmm, maybe I'll call Elbert after school. It'll be long distance though. He's all the way in USA! Blah.  On the phone with Roger. Talking about band, PCW, the usual... haha! So many brothers! Muahahaha! Wweeeee! I'm high.. okay I'll shut up now.
