I think his goal is to one day sqeeze me so hard that he actually, non-figuratively speaking, squeezes the shit outta me. I know when he has a girlfriend I'm safe from the hugs...help me find him another girlfriend...please.  I stayed after school, and was arm wrestling with people. Two guys beat me....and oh....that made me mad. I went to the weight room and worked out. I love that place. Everyday after school from now on, I'm so there.  I also got asked out today. By who? Don't have a fucking clue. He's older, probably a senior. I'm guessing he was just joking around...but it was still wierd. Apparently, he's "seen me around... lots of places". Now....who the fuck is he?
