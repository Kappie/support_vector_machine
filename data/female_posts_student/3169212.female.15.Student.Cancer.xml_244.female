Now give it back!  Goku:  *angered*  What did you call me!?  Baka:  You heard me, monkey boy!  Goku:  Nyoi-bo!  *funky little stick weapon appears*  Nyoi-sansekkon!  *stick turns into nunchucks*  Baka:  Oh!  So that's how you want to play!  Spirit Bow!  *bow and arrow made of red spirit energy appears*  Everyone else:  NOT IN HERE YOU IDIOTS!  *red energy disipates and Nyoi-sansekkon disappears*  Kuronue:  *yelling**vein popping on forehead*  If you're going to fight, take it outside!  *Baka and Goku take their fight outside*  And hopefully that will be the end of them.
