I'm supposed to go in tomorrow morning to do it at 7:45, but the pot has to be sitting out for an hour.  I'm sure he won't be there at 6:45 so I might go after school on Tuesday.  He better not throw it out, either.  My name is on the bag that it's wrapped up in and all, and Alicia showed me where to put it in the back room, but I still don't trust him.  Anyways, I just realized last week that my life is really boring and routine.  I figured that out when I could write all of my homework in my assignment notebook after first period.  Yuck.  I hate it.  I hope my whole life isn't going to be this............. normal.  I guess that's how to describe it.  Normal, dull, boring, routine........ however you want to describe it.  I just really hope that when I grow up, I'm not one of those soccer moms.  You know the type, get up, make breakfast, get kids up, feed them breakfast, make sure kids get ready, get yourself ready, take kids to school, go to work, work your ass off all day, pick kids up from school, take Timmy to soccer, take Mary to ballet................................  BLAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It's boring just thinking about it.  That would totally suck.  I don't plan on living like that.  Maybe I just won't have kids, but I really don't think that would stop my life from being routine.  I'm going to aspire to bigger and better things (not like that, perverts........... well, maybe like that, too)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
