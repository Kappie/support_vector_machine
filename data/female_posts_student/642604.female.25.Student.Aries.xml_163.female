     
      So first of all I have to comment on last weekend since I have delayed it for so long.  Went to two dave shows... one on Saturday night and one on Sunday night and both were fun but Sunday was a blast because my cousin who I rarely get to see and adore came.  We saw the very beginning of Isabel hitting VA Beach on Monday morning when we prepared for our trip back.  After dropping off Susan (cousin) at the Norfolk airport we made our way back and despite the oncoming weather and many detours for different reasons we made great time.  By the way, DMB closed with an amazing two step on Sunday night!  Weather was perfect that night in VA Beach, so glad it waited till the next morning to kick in!  Tuesday and Wednesday were normal days at work  Thursday was the onset of Isabel, because of schools being out and the possible oncoming weather we got out at 12... nice.  Packed up Tobey, went to mom's, lost power at 6, ate by candlelight, put a puzzle together by candlelight, tried to set up my sister's computer for a dvd but her batery died right away, talked to people who made it sound like power might be on at my apartment, packed up tobey again and drove back to Manassas around 9.  Had power and watched dvds till I fell asleep.  Friday, woke up to Kim calling to see if work was going on since she didn't have power.  Called Jess and found out we were opening at 10.  Went into work, they bought lunch for everyone who showed up and then got out at 3:30.  Friday night I drove out to see someone and came home by 10:30.  Exciting so far huh?  It gets better...  Saturday, spent the day doing nothing... had plans for that night... person backed out on me by leaving a message on my cell phone and never gave a reason so after calling around and trying to find friends to hang with and finding they were all already out and about I decided to drink myself into a stupor.  And when Erin gets drunk and sad it's never a good thing... fortunately Bret took a moment to cheer me up which was a nice surprise.  Sunday... I woke up LATE!!!!  Got in my car and went over to my dad's to feed the birds and fish and then headed to Borders to pick up a new pilates dvd.  I've been using the same one for over 4 months now and it's no longer challenging for me.  We'll come back to the dvd later.  Then when I got home I decided for some reason to be productive.  I had set the challenge of cleaning the entire apartment but never got there.  I decided since my room is friggin huge I needed to take better advantage of it and decided to create more open space.  So I started by clearing off my shelving unit next to my bed and moved it out of the way and then decided to shift my entire bed into a new direction and push it way up against the wall.  Doesn't sound so difficult right?  This is what I thought.  My mattress is made of air, it's a select comfort and is much like the nautilus mattress you see advertised... it's all air.  Seemed like it would be a piece of cake.  Wrong.  My bed frame is cast iron.  Cast iron is heavy... it took me like half an hour and tons of bruises to move the bed but damn did I feel like I accomplished something when it was done.  Then came the restructuring of the shelving unit and the deep cleaning of my room.  I moved the stereo, moved the lamps and then picked up EVERYTHING.  I currently have a massive pile of clothes to be ironed (they've been on the floor of my room for weeks) and clothes to be laundered.  Well by now the laundry is almost done, the ironing hasn't been touched however.  Because after the room was cleaned I decided to wash the sheets and blankets on my bed, threw those in and decided it would be a good time to clean my bathroom.  Went in there and picked up (deep cleaning will happen tomorrow).  Then got the bright idea to do my pilates so I could then take a much needed shower!  I figured it would be a bit harder but not by much, I didn't get the advanced pilates or anything.  Now that it's over and I struggled through the whole thing can I tell you I HAD NO IDEA HOW MANY MUSCLES I HAD IN MY STOMACH, ARMS, and LEGS!!!  They all hurt, every single one of them!  Oh my God I am in pain!  Taking a shower even hurt.  Well this put me right in time for the Survivor rerun which Ben kindly told me about yesterday!  I missed it the first time cause of the power outage in Fairfax.  So I watched it.  It was good stuff!  Picked my favorite team right away and have decided for right now I was correct in chosing them!  OWWW my arms hurt from typing this.  Now Leigh and I are trying to decide which Phish shows to hit this upcoming season!  See, what an exciting weekend but damn was I productive.  Dishes got done, cooked dinner, did pilates and my room looks awesome!  I couldn't ask for more!  By the way, Bill's (my uncle) house is just fine!  A couple leaves scattered in the front yard and that's it.  Isabel hit Nags Head hard but thankfully took pitty on my uncle's house.  Also my uncle is making an amazing recovery!  YAY!!!!  I will go down next weekend or the weekend after.  I feel bad for Hatteras and the rest of Kitty Hawk.  Also my dad's boat is fine, didn't get touched.  So for once everything seems to be going well and I am grateful for that!  Now I think I am going to bed to prepare for the full week of work I have waiting for me.
