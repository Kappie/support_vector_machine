I have now, at this very moment realised that labels not only mean so much  but also have the power to influence or in this case destroy one's perception of their future.   Little Sister as it stands is deceptively innocent.   How could these words take my being from a place of positivity and hope to bitter disappointment.  I don't know how often others come across a person that is so much more special than the rest.   Someone so in tune with your thoughts, feelings… your vibe that they embody your idea of perfection.  Somebody so unique that you begin to redirect the original course of your life to allow for their inclusion.   Is this as good as it gets?  If so, the knowledge of your existence alone makes me want to be a better woman.   Alas, unrequited love is a bitch and she's spiteful.  Whatever flaws or inadequacies I possess that prevent you from being able to envision me as your significant other… my only retort is… I am who I am!   I just pray that as I walk through life, I will find another like you who doesn't see me as his Little Sister.
