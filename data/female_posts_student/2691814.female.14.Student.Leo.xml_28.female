Friday was just so terrible...bad luck. heres what happend:I couldn't lock my stupid door cuz the key wouldn't budge, Keith had to go to the hospital, My cd player wouldn't work on the bus, I got marker all over me and i didn't know it until i looked at my hands, my lollipop fell to the ground(i have no idea how). But there was one good thing, got to go shopping and go to the mall. But of course something scared me and my family so much that i just yelled the F word infront of my family. Yes...this taxi van pulled out right infront of us while we were driving and we almost hit. Thank goddess i had my seatbelt on lol. I was very shaken up but i didin't let my parents know. I kinda just laughed it off. My dad was like"ok i need a cigarrette" and he doesn't even smoke lol. I was like "pass me one too" but...i hope they knew i was joking lol.    The rest of the time driving we were jumpy because of what happend. Another taxi van kinda pulled up to us so we kinda swerved over. I swear i was about to flip off those mo'fo's lol. It really made me pissed.     But the rest of the day was fine i guess...enough of the bad luck already...now i really believe that Friday the 13th will haunt me the next time it comes around.
