This is for for me, so I can organize my thoughts; Ken, so I can explain EVERYTHING; and for everyone else who cares enough to read the whole thing...  I'm not really sure where to start this.  There isn't really a definite beginning..  Idk, I'll start w/ when Ken called me while I was at the mall...  By then I'd already had it made up in my mind that I was going to tell him everything that night.  Then he started telling me about how shitty his past two days had been, and all the bad things that had happened, and I wasn't really focusing much on the convo b/c my mind was 8000 miles away from anywhere, just mumbling replies every now and then...  And then when he hung up he didn't say I love you, which I think is the first time he hasn't in a long time, and I wanted to cry b/c I knew that he knew, and then I felt REALLY bad for wanting to dump all of this on him on top of his super shitty past few days...  So anyway, then I texted Lainie and told her that I felt bad for doing it that night, and she called me back a little later and I vented on her for a few minutes but she had to get back to work so I didn't really accomplish much I just told her I'd call her tomorrow...  So then I went home and I think I was home for like, 2 mins before Ken got there, and I was sitting on my bed about 2 sesconds from hysterical sobbing and I didn't know what to do...  I couldn't look at him knowing that he knew...  And all the words had totally evaporated from my mind.  I really didn't know why to say, I just kept my face on my pillow and tried to keep myself from crying...  Then I finally managed to semi- look at him, and he told me that he was pretty sure he knew what was coming, and he was just waiting to hear it.  The tone in his voice... he just sounded so upset, and that made me cry...  then he gave me a note that he'd written and went to the bathroom.   No way in hell would I have been able to read it in front of him, so I went outside and sat in the rocks on the side of the house, reading and crying and ignoring the mosquitos...  The letter hurt a lot, b/c... some of it was right, but some of it was totally wrong, as far as how I felt and why I wanted to break up with him...  And I wanted him to know that, but there was no way I could tell him that night.  And that's what he said in the letter too, that if I broke w/ him that night he wouldn't be able to talk about it and he'd want to leave right away.  Anyway... then I came back inside and leaned up against the wall next to him, and all I could say was "I don't know how to phrase it," and he said something like "I don't know why you have to find the right words to just say it"...  And... god, the tone of his voice... he sounded so.. hurt... angry... upset... The way he said it hurt me more than anything had the whole night, and I just blurted out "it's not just breaking up, there's so much more to it" and then I started sobbing and couldn't stop...  then he started crying too and I felt so horrible and I wished more than anything everything in life could just be perfect and fair...  Then he said that he was going to leave, and he'd call me later, and that he wanted me to write down what I wanted to say to him...  So I just wrote down my blog URL and gave that to him, told him that he could find a lot of stuff here...  I'm not sure that was the best idea, b/c all of the older stuff is missing,  plus...  I'm not really sure what I've said about him on here.  Nothing bad, I know that, just...  stuff I might've said out of frustration or something...  But I can't hide from shit anymore...  I'm honest with everything else in my life, this was the last piece of the puzzle.  He has every right in the world to know everything I've ever felt.  But yeah... after he walked out of my room I threw myself down on my bed and curled up under my covers and sobbed for god knows how long... Kait came in and wouldn't leave me alone "is something wrong brit?  is there something wrong?  what's wrong?  is it something with your friends?  with ken?" and she wouldn't fucking go away...  Finally I kicked her out and just sat in my room crying...  I couldn't find any Kleenex, so I had to use a roll of toilet paper...  I turned on music b/c music always helps me... Of course the first CD that came on was Evanesence...  That makes me cry anyway, so it just pretty much kept me crying,  but I was too stupid to change the CD... Then I texted Lainie to call me when she got home from work, then I started throwing things around my room...  so it's pretty much trashed right now... then I dumped all my journals all over the floor and got all my Ken stuff and put it in that box and shoved it under my bed...  The ring, the bracelet, v-day card, the pic of us w/ the tiger, the handcuffs, the letter (the only letter I've gotten from him in 7 months, and it was about breaking up), other stuff... everything that reminded me of him, b/c I couldn't look at it without crying...  The only thing I left out was the giant monkey, b/c it was comforting sorta.  B/c like, after I'd trown everything in the box I just wanted more than anything to hug him and cry, so I hugged the monkey instead...  Then Lainie called me a little after 10 and we talked for over an hour, and by the end of the convo I felt a bit better...  She offered to let me come over to her house, but I didn't have a way there, so it didn't really matter.  Then I tried to eat ice cream, b/c ice cream is an awesome comfort food, but I hate vanilla, and all we had was nasty tasting chocolate stuff...  Then when I hung up w/ her I was going to watch a movie, but the only movie that sounded good at the time was Sleepless in Seattle, which A) is Ken's; and B) last time I watched it was with him.  So I ruled that out, and figured that I'd just force myself to sleep instead.  Which actually worked fairly well, most likely thanks to the convo w/ Lainie calming me down a lot...  Before I fell asleep I texted Ken... apologizing for the way things had gone, and asking him to read my blog when he got a chance... then he called me, and I couldn't answer it... I hit the silence button after the first ring, then I stared at my phone for another ring, then threw it on my bed an rolled over on my side...  waited until the phone message alert beeped then listened to my voicemail...  then fell asleep...  any now today is a new day, and I haven't really done much all day...  Crazy Katie and Beth called wanting me to come over to Robert's, but I'm not really in the mood to hang out with anyone...  Lainie said she'd call me tonight.  And Ken said he'd call me today, but... idk if I can.  I'll probably just ignore his calls for a few days, until Tues or Weds maybe...  I need to get drunk so bad right now...  but I have neither money nor alcohol at the moment...  ARGH.... what's it going to do anyway?  I'll have a few hours of happy time, then everything just comes back anyway...  But now... the rest of this...  that ^ was the how, this is the why.  This is everything, folks...  100% why I feel the way I do and why I did what I did, so repeated some new, depending on who you are... here goes... mostly addressed directly to Ken...  Ken I love you so much I don't know how I can make you see that... I didn't do this b/c I hate you, I did this for so many reasons it's going to take me hours to write it all...  First off, the letter -- you were right and wrong, as far as the ring goes.  Yes, it did scare me, b/c suddenly it put ideas in my head that I never realized I'd think about this early in my life...  Just... commitment in general, especially.  I'm too immature to think about that right now, not on any level.  I still need to grow up and figure myself out.  I kinda described this in my "Ken and Sam" post...  I just feel... inferior as far as experience and maturity level go, and I don't think that's a healthy thing to have in a relationship.   I'd be a much better person, friend, girlfriend if I could just grow up and experience the world around me.    And I'm so sorry that I never told you these things right away, it was just that...  all of my friends seemed so excited and happy for me, and you just seemed so happy... I didn't want to ruin that.  I didn't want to burst everyone's happiness bubble...   And then in that first week everything hit me so hard and I overreacted to a lot of things and I just kept digging myself deeper and deeper into a hole I had no way to get out of.  And in a way breaking up kind of threw me a rope to get out of that hole, but now I'm in a completely different hole, and this time I have no one to hold and be with...  But I suppose that's what I get for being selfish and wanting to 'try out' other people before I commited myself to one person.  And I'm terrified that when I grow up and finally prove to myself that it is you that I want to be with, you won't be there anymore.  And it'll be no one's fault but my own, and that'll only make it harder to deal with...  But I suppose there's nothing I can do but wait and live life the way it is right now...  Besides the ring, age difference, maturity level things...  Those were the main reasons I need the break from you.  There's everything with me wanting to date other guys before I commit myself to one person...  And I know that it sounds selfish and horrible, like trying on clothes at the store and just returning the ones that you don't want...  You find something you love, but then you want to try a few other things before you buy it...  You can put a hold on it and leave it at the layaway counter, but that's not fair to all the other shoppers.  But if you put it bak on the rack, there's always a chance someone else will come along and snatch it up...  Oiy, I know that was a horrible analogy, but I'm not really thinking a whole lot right now, just typing.  And then there's other stuff.  Little stuff, pretty much stuff that's just in the back of my mind, but random things nonetheless.  Things that we need to addressed if we get back together sometime in the future.  And some of this is my fault, simply b/c I can't talk about things very well and I'm not very good at voicing when things are wrong...  First is the emotional vs. physical thing.  I know we've talked about this several times, and every time I bring it up you would get better about it for awhile, but then after a while things would go back to kinda like what they had been before.  Never as bad as it was in the beginning, but back nonetheless, and after awhile I just gave up on bringing it up.  It was extremely unfair of me to expect you to entirely change yourself for me, b/c there are some things abut me I wasn't and still am not willing to change about myself for you.  Like the blowjob thing, b/c I know that no matter how many times you said it didn't bother you that it really did.  You made enough comments that I picked up on that quite quickly...  but as far as that goes...  I know that it's something that I can get over eventually, but bj's in general are just nasty.  Maybe some people find drinking salt water to be appealing, but it's not very high on my list.  And I know that there's the whole 'reciprocity' thing -- you do this to me, I do that to you, blah blah blah, but...  Tell me, at any time did I even ASK you to do anything to me?  Everything you've done was upon your own free will.  I mean, of course I enjoy those type of things, but I'm perfectly happy without them, as I've tried to explain to you.  Especially when we're at my house, b/c there's too much of a chance of getting caught.  I really don't like the idea of my parents accidentaly walking in on something or coming downstairs and seeing something they don't need to see.  They'd lose respect for me, and they probably would have prevented me from seeing you as much too.  And as long as I'm living in this house there isn't a whole lot I can do about what they think of me.  It's a little late now, but I'd be so much happier if they were pretty much clueless as to what I do with boys.  I'd rather have them thinking all we do is play cards, watch movies, have water fights in the backyard, etc.  Which would actually be quite fine w/ me if that were pretty much all that happened anyway.  But I've said that countless times before, and if you haven't figured it out yet I don't know how else to explain it to you.  If that bothers you a lot maybe you should have brought that up to me every time I told you how I felt...  As far as sex itself goes... that was never a problem.  You are always so patient, and you never tried to talk me into anything.  You have no idea how much more that made me love you.  I know how much you wanted to have sex, yet you never brought it up unless I brought it up first, and never got mad or defensive or whatever whenever I gave you a reason why we couldn't at that time.  Thank you so much.    So yeah... that was that.  Please don't think the sex and stuff were the reason I broke up with you, bc they weren't.  I really do think that I need to a break to let myself grow up, and I hope to god that you'll see that eventually and not hate me for all of this.  And hopefully in a few days I'll be able to talk to you, and we can talk some of this stuff out w/o either of us freaking out (most likely me).  And hopefully none of this will be a problem later on, and eventually I'll be better at communication.  So I guess I'll leave you with one final message and quit typing, b/c I've been writing this for over 2 hours and I imagine it's getting to be a bit long...  I never meant to hurt you like this...  I didn't want to be the one to come out and say it directly.  I wanted you to see all of this ^ and see why I feel the way that I do.  I wanted you to understand and agree with me that breaking up is a good idea for right now.  I wanted everything to be as close to a mutual agreement as possible...  I hope you believe me when I say that I really don't want this break up to be forever.  Just a break, time for me to discover myself.  I don't know how long I need...  6 months?  a year?  two years?  All I can do is hope that we can stay friends throughout that time, and that when I am ready you're still available...  I love you poo-head.
