But, Billy Collins, the author of six collections of poetry, distinguished professor at Lehman College in the City University of New York, recently served as the Poet Laureate of the United States- even though his literary contributions in my opinion deserve questions. What is the fate of poetry in this sexually enhanced, breast implanted Martian landscape, TV raised generation of Americans, except dissolution into a watery abyss of nothingness.   I was walking through the halls of the University of Colorado at Boulder, where I am a student when I came across a seemingly innocent flyer for a Poetry Book Award Contest, judged by Billy Collins. I who am reasonably well versed (well versed, hah hah) in poets and poetry; I write poetry myself, have read it in poetry readings, and am familiar with most of the major writers, if not a devoted reader of Walt Whitman, Pablo Neruda, Marianne Moore, T.S. Elliot, e.e. cummings, Gertrude Stein, Rimbaud, Baudelaire, Blake, Dryden, Shakespeare, Alexander Pope, Rilke, Ogden Nash, Emily Dickenson, Sylvia Plath, Ann Sexton, Shelley, Yeats, Keats, etc...   I am familiar enough and flexible enough, and well read, enough to I think feel out a new style or idea. But, Billy Collins, alas, is another "stupid American", who brings his cultural literacy and illiteracy equally into his writing, in order to expose his own shallowness, the shallow nature of his writing and its' pointlessness- absurd personal anecdotal prose. Ah. But one must whet one's whistle:  Here are a few Billy Collins Masterpieces! And this man was chosen as Poet Laureate, some Presidents need to get out more and enjoy libraries.  ::::::::::::. 1. Study in Orange and White    I knew that James Whistler was part of the Paris scene,  but I was still surprised when I found the painting  of his mother at the Mus√©e d'Orsay  among all the colored dots and mobile brushstrokes  of the French Impressionists.  And I was surprised to notice  after a few minutes of benign staring,  how that woman, stark in profile  and fixed forever in her chair,  began to resemble my own ancient mother  who was now fixed forever in the stars, the air, the earth.  You can understand why he titled the painting  "Arrangement in Gray and Black"  instead of what everyone naturally calls it,  but afterward, as I walked along the river bank,  I imagined how it might have broken  the woman's heart to be demoted from mother  to a mere composition, a study in colorlessness.  As the summer couples leaned into each other  along the quay and the wide, low-slung boats  full of spectators slid up and down the Seine  between the carved stone bridges  and their watery reflections,  I thought: how ridiculous, how off-base.  It would be like Botticelli calling "The Birth of Venus"  "Composition in Blue, Ochre, Green, and Pink,"  or the other way around  like Rothko titling one of his sandwiches of color  "Fishing Boats Leaving Falmouth Harbor at Dawn."  Or, as I scanned the menu at the cafe  where I now had come to rest,  it would be like painting something laughable,  like a chef turning on a spit  over a blazing fire in front of an audience of ducks  and calling it "Study in Orange and White."  But by that time, a waiter had appeared  with my glass of Pernod and a clear pitcher of water,  and I sat there thinking of nothing  but the women and men passing by--  mothers and sons walking their small fragile dogs--  and about myself,  a kind of composition in blue and khaki,  and, now that I had poured  some water into the glass, milky-green.     2. Reading an Anthology of Chinese Poems of the Sung Dynasty, I Pause To Admire the Length and Clarity of Their Titles    It seems these poets have nothing  up their ample sleeves  they turn over so many cards so early,  telling us before the first line  whether it is wet or dry,  night or day, the season the man is standing in,  even how much he has had to drink.  Maybe it is autumn and he is looking at a sparrow.  Maybe it is snowing on a town with a beautiful name.  "Viewing Peonies at the Temple of Good Fortune  on a Cloudy Afternoon" is one of Sun Tung Po's.  "Dipping Water from the River and Simmering Tea"  is another one, or just  "On a Boat, Awake at Night."  And Lu Yu takes the simple rice cake with  "In a Boat on a Summer Evening  I Heard the Cry of a Waterbird.  It Was Very Sad and Seemed To Be Saying  My Woman Is Cruel--Moved, I Wrote This Poem."  There is no iron turnstile to push against here  as with headings like "Vortex on a String,"  "The Horn of Neurosis," or whatever.  No confusingly inscribed welcome mat to puzzle over.  Instead, "I Walk Out on a Summer Morning  to the Sound of Birds and a Waterfall"  is a beaded curtain brushing over my shoulders.  And "Ten Days of Spring Rain Have Kept Me Indoors"  is a servant who shows me into the room  where a poet with a thin beard  is sitting on a mat with a jug of wine  whispering something about clouds and cold wind,  about sickness and the loss of friends.  How easy he has made it for me to enter here,  to sit down in a corner,  cross my legs like his, and liste   3.   Pinup  The murkiness of the local garage is not so dense that you cannot make out the calendar of pinup drawings on the wall above a bench of tools. Your ears are ringing with the sound of the mechanic hammering on your exhaust pipe, and as you look closer you notice that this month's is not the one pushing the lawn mower, wearing  a straw hat and very short blue shorts, her shirt tied in a knot just below her breasts. Nor is it the one in the admiral's cap, bending forward, resting her hands on a wharf piling, glancing over the tiny anchors on her shoulders. No, this is March, the month of great winds, so appropriately it is the one walking her dog along a city sidewalk on a very blustery day. One hand is busy keeping her hat down on her head and the other is grasping the little dog's leash, so of course there is no hand left to push down her dress which is billowing up around her waist exposing her long stockinged legs and yes the secret apparatus of her garter belt. Needless to say,  in the confusion of wind and excited dog the leash has wrapped itself around her ankles several times giving her a rather bridled and helpless appearance which is added to by the impossibly high heels she is teetering on. You would like to come to her rescue, gather up the little dog in your arms, untangle the leash, lead her to safety, and receive her bottomless gratitude, but the mechanic is calling you over to look at something under your car. It seems that he has run into a problem and the job is going to cost more than he had said and take  much longer than he had thought. Well, it can't be helped, you hear yourself say as you return to your place by the workbench, knowing that as soon as the hammering resumes you will slowly lift the bottom of the calendar just enough to reveal a glimpse of what  the future holds in store: ah,  the red polka dot umbrella of April and her upturned palm extended coyly into the rain.   4.   Another reason why I don't keep a gun in the house   The neighbors' dog will not stop barking. He is barking the same high, rhythmic bark that he barks every time they leave the house. They must switch him on on their way out.  The neighbors' dog will not stop barking. I close all the windows in the house and put on a Beethoven symphony full blast but I can still hear him muffled under the music, barking, barking, barking,  and now I can see him sitting in the orchestra, his head raised confidently as if Beethoven had included a part for barking dog.  When the record finally ends he is still barking, sitting there in the oboe section barking, his eyes fixed on the conductor who is entreating him with his baton  while the other musicians listen in respectful silence to the famous barking dog solo, that endless coda that first established Beethoven as an innovative genius.  :::::::::::::::::::::::::.  Maybe I am not appreciating the humor or irony, but I find that this diminished role of poetry, as mere humor, a place to brag about one's idiocy. I see a few things in Billy Collins, first that he is an opportunist taking advantage of the changes in the literary scene since the Beat movement brought us Ferlinghetti, Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, the poets of the Civil Right' era, and Sylvia Plath, all who stretched the cultural boundaries of poetry as well as innovating in style and language, yet still maintaing a purpose, a underlining beauty of the idea, or of a turn of phrase, that emphasis that makes poetry important to read, a pursuit of beauty, truth, wonder or understanding, as well as breaking ground on a literary plot.   Billy Collins, Poet Laureate? Really. Not exactly a Robert Frost or a Maya Angelou, a literate hoax, a presumption on an audience, and he gets paid for this?  Well, there are plenty of fools in the world we live in, no list of credentials and credits can possibly replace the value of meaningful writing. Eh.  Everyone needs to eat- one shenanigan fools another.   I see a few intelligent themes in his poems, but nothing like Poetry. 1. Tourism: the position of an American traveling in other cultures, or countries, with a limited education 2. Titles: the charm of titles 3. Looking at a work of art, as an American, and finally 4. Everyday thinking when faced with extraordinary or pretentious subject matter.  Thanks.  Alisia Barringer
