I just had one jerky customer who threw a fit because his ice cream was "too soft". And we all know   I   have control of that...But moving on. Today was pretty normal, pretty boring. Nothing exciting. Oh That dream, much to my dismay, did not continue. I was trying to make up endings but it just didn't work. So, I suppose I'll just have to sleep until it pops up, gives me a bit of a suprise, you know?  My dog is snoring by my side right now, and I can't move her, that'd be cruel. What's a girl to do? Oh...I tried calling Lance today, wasn't home.  Dissapointing, but expected.  I ought to make a support group. You know, a "love yourself" type of thing. If you wish to join IM me at Kaymo06 or email me at that same screen name, at yahoo.  Or don't  Well of all my posts this has been the most pointless, and for that matter completely rediculous. But I feel to maintain sanity, I need to pour my day out somewhere, even if it is to a blog, which is rarely read, or for that matter, not taken heed to. Oh well.   And  Tommorow, Tommorow, Tommorow shall come.  Kayle
