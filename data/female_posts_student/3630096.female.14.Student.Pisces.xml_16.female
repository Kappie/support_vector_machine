So I quickly finished up the literature assignment which took up 1 1/2 hr to complete. I just did it anyhow...then I discover I have finished my chinese homework, so I quickly finished it all up. By the time everythig was done, it was already 1pm. I on the computer then switched off then got visitors...I go read a book...until about 2.20pm. Wash up, got dressed, went out by about 3.30pm...I saw Jasreel and Lixiang on the bus, odd eh? Both of them actually recognised me! weird. Then board the bus and went to victoria concert hall. The concert is terrific! It's marvellous and nice. Especially for the Song, 'Godzilla Eats Las Vegas'. Although I can hardly make out the words on the screen, the pictures were hilarious. I regretted not bringing my spectacles along...sigh. Then go home... On the way actually, there were a lot of conversations on the subjects we choose. I could not decide, however. I don't know...which one is better? I don't want to get into biography nor dnt but there doesn't seem to be a choice. Pure science is really competitive but I'm not interested in literature or geography at all. I do not seem to make up my mind afterall... I'm so confused...people actually chose A,B,C,D. But I cannot make up my mind....there wasn't enough time. I'm on two minds, unable to decide... This is really a hard decison to make.
