Could it be that I’m a threat? When we’re together you act as she doesn’t exist We flirt away We have a ball But in the back of my mind I know That you two have done it all Here she comes She sees me here We girls lie and act like friends To ease the tension you try to distract her Making out sure works on her But that distracts me too! Is there something more to it? This display in front of me Perhaps to make me jealous Maybe to cause me pain They say “All’s fair in love and war” But they must have never been in love And been forced to watch and wait Now I will wait for you Just like you waited for me “What goes around comes around” they say I find it to be true
