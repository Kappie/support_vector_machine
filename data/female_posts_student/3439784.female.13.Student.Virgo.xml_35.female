Same old song, just a drop of water in an endless sea All we do, crumbles to the ground, though we refuse to see  Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind  [Now] Don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky It slips away, and all your money won't another minute buy.  Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind Dust in the wind, everything is dust in the wind.   i really like the lyrics to that song. theyre beauuuutiful! anywho. man, im bitchy. im just in fucktaclur mood. dah well, ill live and survive. ciao.  .chels.
