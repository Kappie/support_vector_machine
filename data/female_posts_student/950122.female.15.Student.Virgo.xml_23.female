I bought a book of Hamlet. I couldn't find an english version of Noli, so I decided to buy it instead. I remember someone telling me that we might take it up in third year, so I decided to look it up. [Hoshi, was that you?]  I haven't read past the first scene... n_n; The way Shakespeare wrote is quite confusing. He has no sense of sentence construction! >    Not much happened today... So I'll be signing off early. Sweet dreams. That's what we all need.
