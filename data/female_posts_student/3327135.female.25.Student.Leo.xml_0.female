Currently watching Disc 5 of FOJ and I just think that Flora's acting was really good for a newcomer(at that time) and her perfomance kept improving ever since. Actually, I had watched Burning Flame II before, but at that time, I disliked Flora's character for I think she snatched someone's husband. However, I just need to have everything with Flora in it, so I bought it as a keepsake and for appreciating how beautiful Flora is in that show  .  I had also bought Flora's second album   again because the packaging is different and I can put one at my workplace and one at home.   Now, Flora totally replaces Sammi from my heart   , mind and soul. Just a mention of Flora's name or knowing that someone also likes her or acknowledges how beautiful and talented she is, is enough to make my day!!!
