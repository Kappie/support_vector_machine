I miss everyone! It was a great experience and I really enoyed it. Well for the most part. The stalker guys weren't that great and some of the seminars were kind of...not that exciting. I met so many cool people though. Larissa, Edd, John, Jamie, Matt, Eric, Chris, Amanda, Christian, Tanner, Jim and many more! They were all really awesome! Larissa (Lars, Lari) and Jamie were my roommates, they were both really great! Larissa and I hung out a lot and we had a little group that we mainly hung out with, it changed through out the ten days a bit but pretty much remained the same. Our first little group was basically Chris and Charlie, but Charlie got annoying and became one of out stalker guys and then Chris sort of started ignoring us...probably because we payed more attention to Edd. Anyway then we started hanging out with Edd and John who are just completely awesome! Then we had Eric, Matt and Christian hang out with us a few times, and they were all fantastic guys! We also hung out with Dan and Fred two more awesome dudes! Heh heh, all in all the trip was fantastic and I was sad to go home! I did get some totally rad pictures though! I think the group is gonna just trade a bunch of pics...at least I hope so. I really want to see the whole bunch of them again! They were all so wonderful!
