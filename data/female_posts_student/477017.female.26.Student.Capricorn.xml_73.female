Let me explain... The Yanks were supposed to be playing the  urlLink BoSox  at 2:05 PM yesterday.  urlLink ESPN  decided at some point that they were going to make it the 'Game of the Week'. Game time is now pushed back to 8:00 PM. Now, I am not saying that it wasn't a good decision to have the game in Prime Time. What I am saying is why is that fair to the players, fans and ticketholders of this game? Baseball players are just that, they play for a living. But, what about the rest of the world? Don't people have to work on Monday mornings? It's not like we're talking about a quick game. I was up until 12:30 AM watching it. It's a good thing that I didn't have to wake up early this morning to go to work. And what about the fans! Certainly, Senator John Kerry didn't have to worry about the traffic after getting out of Fenway but what about Joe Average who had to sit and wait in traffic for two hours. Who gives ESPN the right to change someone's entire day.
