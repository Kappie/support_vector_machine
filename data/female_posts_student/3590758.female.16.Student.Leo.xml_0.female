The place i had the most fun at was this 50's themed diner where the waitors and waitresses sang. I had a few favorites...Jazz, Philly "cheese stake", Eric and John. lol yes all of them guys. but hey, it was only fun and games. Eric the waitor, stoped dead in his tracks and gave me the seckz eye and pointed to me.then everyone in the resturant looked at me... i sort of felt...dirty...special...yet embaressed, all at the same time. but it was okay. lol he was probobly doing it for tipz and he was an older dude X_X and i will be having none of that, it was simply an experience. then we moved on. to the wax museum..hah...rape-age of wax models....there was this one wax model, specificly, of elton john..that was in this pose...he was leaned over with his hand and arm out smiling...so..being me...i asked jamie to come over and take a picture...as i bent forward and the wax model touched muh bum, then other people came around and started laughing...as i stood there...waiting for jamie to take the picture....that pic was priceless....then i took a picture of a old japanese man in a sushi bar...right next to a "hot and crusty"....heh...hot and crusty japanese man....anyway...i saw this billboard that i also took a picture of..."bunny sutra" it was called....it was a billboard of these innocent looking pink bunnies...in random sex positions...*sigh* oh how wonderful...my urban adventure! HAZZAH!  Love and lollipops ^_~
