I will add though that i believe msn is evil, i spend a little to many hours of my life on it talking to people i know and people who r just added through friends. As much as i love my dear msn messenger it will end up turning me in to a lazy fat little lady who sits at her coputer all day with nothing better to do. I should so as my mother and papa says and go out and get a job but it becomes fustrating and i really believe people should come looking for me, not that im anything specail just it would be alot easier for me that way. Again i shall leave and post again later
