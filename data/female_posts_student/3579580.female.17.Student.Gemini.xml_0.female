I leave for Costa Rica on Wednesday, Mel leaves for a Eurotrip tomorrow (terrible movie), Kat for Finland on Thursday... and Alexa is home, her only friend her brand new Blog.  Check that out by the way, there is a link on my side menu.... it's like  Sex and the City  moves to the suburbs so far, our own little Carrie Bradshaw. Delicious.  Once Lex and Mel had left, Kat and I went into e-hood and ran into this guy she knows since she was three.  He lived in the Galaxy apartment buildings with her.  We bought a cookie with a Sacajawea (my new FAV currency) and then he gave each of us a free lemony-limeny sorbet... not to mention somthing else green.  It was an interesting experience, and every time I hear the song "Hey Jude" by the Beatles, I will think of it.  Here is a cute pic of me and my girls (and some guys) on our crayzay night on the town:       The girls are me, Kat, Lex, and Mel. (Bex took the picture, she's hot too though, don't worry...hah)   What a night that was, last Wednesday.  We went to this party at Coral hosted by the infamous actor who played young Ben Stiller in "Keeping the Faith" who forgot to tell us that it was for 18 and older only.  After some arguing though we got in.  We then procedeed to have a rockstar night, loose my lipgloss and Kat's eyeliner, and end up at the Plaza diner in Fort Lee at 6 in the morning.  Good times.  Ok, I'm tired from my rendevous in the back of Ben  Jerry's, I'm off to dreamland. tata.
