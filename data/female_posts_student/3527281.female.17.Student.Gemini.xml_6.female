But then I graduated . . . or got kicked out, I don't remember which. But I was there for a while, and I worked there for a while, so I know it pretty well. So . . . I guess that's why I'm here. Yeah. I have three blogs now . . . none of which are mine.  So, Hillsdale. It's pretty cool, even if it is out in the middle of no where. Although, I notice they started all the cool stuff after I left. The humanities class, the newspaper . . . but that's okay. I'll survive.  Anyway, you'll probably get a lot of college ramblings from me . . . once I'm back in college that is. But for the most part, I'll probably just sit back and let the people who actually go to Hillsdale ramble away. If I know the people that Jacqui probably invited to this blog, they're very good at rambling. (Incidently Jacqui, Tarah's email is blondie26_2006@hotmail.com)  Which reminds me . . . who else did get invited to this blog?  Go Falcons!
