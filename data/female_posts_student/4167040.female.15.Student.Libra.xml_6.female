I'm reading this book called 'Keesha's House' (I think that's what it's called anyway) and it's pretty interesting, it's written in a weird/poetic way. After I read that I got on-line to see if Jeff was on and he wasn't, so I put my away message up and then I went and ate breakfast. After that I came back and Jeff was on! So then he called me and we talked for awhile. We talked about all the stupid but funny memories with me and Michael, lol...good good times! Oh, last night I had a dream and Michael and Jeff were in it! It made me happy...lol of course, because the 2 best people in the world were in my dream! After I hung up with Jeff I practiced the piano and then put my CD cases in alphabetical order, lol...I have no life, I already figured that out. Then I got changed, and Jeff called again! Later I'm going to Epic to work out and then take a shower, get ready and go to the mall! Woo Hoo! Well, I guess that's all I have to say for now, so I'll write in here later! Luv yall!
