I woke up this morning worked for a few hours and then went to my cabin and went back to sleep. Had lunch around 1:00 when Lisa and I headed to Cabo for our favorite spot, Pueblo Vielo. Our waiter recognized us immediately and took special care of us as if he knew how much we had worked since the last time we saw him. We had some amazing food and then headed to the mall to do some shopping. There was some football/soccer/baseball (heck, I don't know what sport) victory in Cabo so all the locals were driving around honking with red jerseys hanging out their window. It was funny - we were cracking up. We got back about 4 and I havejust kind of been playin catch up this afternoon.  I had after dinner drinks with the producer of the Ellen Show and her family. Very well connected family!  I am looking forward to spending more time with them throughout this cruise.  She gave me her card and told me anytime I was in the Burbank area that I could get VIP tickets to Ellen's show.  Pretty neat! Apparently there's a 6 month waiting list as is and she said that she would love to have me there to meet everyone.  I really thought that was nice of her to offer.  We talked a lot about the show and Ellen and it was just interesting to meet someone who worked with one of the greatest. Alas, I just retired from that meeting and now i am jsut blogging and checking email.  I met a really nice couple on the last cruise that emailed me today.  They were so incredible. I am really looking forward to all of the guest relationships I am building onboard. Very fun.   Tonight wehave our crew Christmas party - not as elegant as the passengers as I hear we will be served Pizza and Beer. Guess we can't ask for much more. Hahaha. That is definitely one of the most interesting Christmas dinners I have had. Nonetheless, I am sure it will be fun.   My familyis the greatest. I received all of my christmas presents yesterday with a card signed by all.  My grandpa left the funniest message on my card. He said watch out for the scary men.  It was funny, I laughed really hard. And then I cried. It was really depressing to be sitting on my bed all alone in my cabin opening my presents by myself.  Esecially after I had a glimpse of the contents when the security guard checked my packages for bombs. I told the security officer, Ita that i was glad we could share that moment together. (Very sarcastically).  None theless, all of my packages from Jennifer and family were much appreciated and very much needed. I felt very loved and missed and I guess that warmed my spirit enough for Christmas.   Gotta run now. Ciao as we say here.  Best wishes to all for a safe and Merry Christmas.   Shelly
