Everyone at the office thought she was absolutely adorable.  Appt went well.  I am now on a mission to set boundaries in my life with the ppl, typically men, who walk all over me.  So watch out Alan, Tom, and Angel to name a few.  Not that you are bad people, but in some way, shape, or form you cross boundaries that I need to put into place.  Boundaries that have effected me enough to talk to my therapist about, which indicates that I am uncomfortable with them.  Went and picked up Shane from school and met his OT at the house.  Went to my mom's for lunch and nap time.  It was nice because I got to lay down with the kids and take a nap myself.  Picked up Lex and Nic and went to the grocery store for some light shopping.  Milk, eggs, that kinda stuff.  Then came home and watched some T.V. with them.  We all are going to sleep in my bed.  Not a very eventful day except for the therapy.  I did talk to Alan about the weekend plans for a visit but they fell through and nothing happened.  Oh well, his loss not ours!   TTFN B
