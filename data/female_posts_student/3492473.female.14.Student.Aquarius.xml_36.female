Especially at school! Take today as an example. The whole 8th grade split up into two teams for "capture the flag." So here I am thinking, "YAY! This is gonna be awesome! No classes, just fun." Boy was I wrong! See, no one told me we'd be running...that was very bad and it pissed me off. Why you ask? Because I have an inhaler that I have to use 20 minutes before any running activity in order to breathe easily. And I didn't use it so obviously, I couldn't breathe very easy. So we start the "game."  Within 2 minutes ,  I already ran into 2 people and hurt my knee.   A few minutes later, guess what? Ran into someone else and hurt my shin! Yeah, so I was having LOTS of fun! (BULL SHIT!) We were also losing so I was even happier about that! So here I am running towards the damn red flag trying to tag it (don't ask, the teachers changed the rules and we had to tag the flag 30 times before we could run with it) and  I just get smacked in the face with someone's shoulder!  It was someone from my team and it was an accident but it pissed me off because I seriously flew and landed on the ground, not moving. All of this happened in front of a teacher. A teacher whom didn't even bother to ask if I was okay. I was on the ground, laying on my tummy,  fucking crying!  Okay, people don't see me cry much so, yes, it was a big deal! And I was on the ground for like 3 minutes and walking around by the teacher for like 5 more minutes. You would think they'd care. That's the funny thing...in the beginning they set all these rules (especially about hitting/tagging people) but once the game started they didn't really care! RR! I was so pissed! And if I go to school tomorrow with a black eye and bruised cheek and one of them asks me how that happens,  I'm gonna scream!  Now that I got that off my chest, I'm gonna go  ice my face  and read a book! Damn world...
