You only have to gather them ONE time though. After you have collected all the map pieces you can "zap" one pet a day with the lab ray. The lab ray can improve or reduce pet stats. The lab ray can ALSO change your pets color, species, or gender. The only way a person can get a ROBOT pet color is by the lab ray.
