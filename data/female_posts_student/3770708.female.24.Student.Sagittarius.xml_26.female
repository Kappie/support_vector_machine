The neighborhood children became intolerable again this afternoon, so we walked across the street to visit the grocery store in search of a distraction. Gavin, who had been mysteriously refusing food all day (opting instead to yank my breasts out in public for several long snacks at the mall), stopped suddenly in front of Loco Moco, squealed in delight, headed straight in, and pulled up a high chair. Indulgent and in no hurry, we made ourselves comfortable and ordered Gavin a large plate of macaroni salad, his favorite. He proceeded to woo us with his charm as he munched happily and sang us excerps from Blue's Clues. A large mirror covered the wall across from him, and he discovered that he could see his chewed food if he opened his mouth wide enough. "Teeth!" he proclaimed in delight, "Aaaaah!" (jazz hands).  Such is the life of an only child with a doting grannie on hand. After dinner, he ran happily around the grocery store, clapped his hands to his cheeks and cried, "Oh dea! No bahs!" when he discovered that the ball bin had been moved. When he was tired, he said "up", and snuggled his head against my neck to rest on the way home. I tugged on his diaper and jammies, and the wee boy curled up against me to sleep immediately. He takes after his father, never complaining about an opportunity to sleep. Last night he slept 7 hours straight before needing to nurse - hoorah for my sore nipples! Let's hope for the same tonight.  Also in Gavin news, he has started nodding "yes" when asked questions. He simply stares when the answer is "no", but we're making progress. He also declares "pee!" and points to his diaper, for obvious reasons. He's really starting to communicate. He even called me "mama" today, for the first time, requesting my water bottle ("wah?"). *swoon*  I know it doesn't sound exciting, but it really, really is. I absolutely love seeing Gavin grow and learn every day. He's amazing..
