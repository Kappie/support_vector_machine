I received a bad news from my mother saying my grandfather passed away yesterday morning [Malaysia time] :’( I was shocked but mostly I felt regret coz I didn’t had the chance to visit him when I went home last April. I think that was the most regrettable moment I had in my entire life. I wish I had seen him before so that I don’t have this guilty feeling burden on me now. But someone had told me that there’s nothing to be regret about because it already happened and I got to move on. I hope my grandfather will forgive all the mistakes I have done and I will always love him and I will never going to forget him. Amin to my grandfather:  Abdul Aziz
