We played  v-ball , watched some  b-ball  and  soccer  and even  sk8boarding ! It was tight seeing so many people all havin fun together and then all coming together to worship too! The speaker was  Art VanZanten , who rocked and the worship team was  One Accord ! We had service every night, and tons of  wonderful ,  awesome ,    amazing    free time! On the way home I was so tired and hyper at the same time...it was funny. I played the  "alphabet game"  like  500  times...or so it seemed! I thouroughly enjoyed it though...  thouroughly.   So yeah, now I'm home and a little heartbroken, but I suppose I'll live. Do you know the feeling when you  totally  give your heart to someone and it only seems that they are putting on an act, or lying to you? Yeah well, if not, then you're lucky. So here I am writing to you, whoever you are reading this, and I don't know what to say. I had fun at camp, but half of the stuff that happened really isn't worth talking about, and the stuff that is, well no one seems to want to hear it. So now, I suppose I'll just go. Hope you are well, talk to you soon. ~K ooo by the way, I have these song lyrics, tell me what you think of them, and tell me who they are written by, must be a remote artist since I can't really find it anywhere but I know it's a song...    I'm ready to whisper in your ear
