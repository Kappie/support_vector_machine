I wish my skies could be bluer, But all I see is gray. My lasting days become fewer, Though my dreams want me to stay.  I wish I didn't have to struggle To make you understand. You don't listen when I'm in trouble, When I need a helping hand.  They think I'm real with this "happiness." They refuse to see me bitter. I'm morphed, molded, and helpless. They don't see that I am a quitter.  I just wish that everyone didn't judge By the smile forced on my face. The emptiness won't seem to budge. I'm unraveling like ripped lace.  Since people can't change me for better, And my words are set in stone. I'm teaching the world the word "never" Because I'm always alone.
