So yesterday I woke up to the phone ringing...it was Jon saying him and his family were gonna sit up by City Hall for the parade so I was like okay...I'll see ya up there. So I got up and ready and walked up there bout 20 till 10. I walked around looking everywhere and couldn't find anyone. I saw Jenna and Paige and walked with them for a few minutes then I spotted my Aunt Laura and went over to talk to her. She was going in and out of my Grandmas so I followed. Finally I saw the Filkins so Jon sat with my cousins and I at the parade. I got a handful or so of candy...it was soo exciting! ...right. Then said by to Jon and went inside my Grandmas to have lunch with the whole Hansen family. Then a family member took Rachel, Katie, and I for a ride in a 1931 chevorle (sp?) touring car. It was pretty neat. Then we decided to go on a walk around town and soon after we left we saw Lance...my stalker. It was scary! He followed us around and wouldnt say anything to us but just followed. Then we went to Grandmas to get rid of him but he walked right in after us. It was scary. Then we came down to my house to watch a movie and finally got rid of him....for 2 hours. At 5 Katie and Rachel went back to Grandmas and Kim came over to my house since I haven't seen her all week and then Lance came along too. So they sat back here and it was scary cuz he was acting all flirty n shit and he asked me out. I was like "HELL NO!" but I was nicer and said "Im sorry I have a boyfriend" *sigh* Thank God for Rachel and Katie. They called and asked if I wanted to go out to eat with them and Grandma at Petes. So we went and Lance left. When we got back he wasnt around Thank God...but he showed up at my house for a little bit. Round 9 Jon came here and we walked uptown to the dance. We decided we didn't know anyone so we left after bout 45 mins of it. We didn't even get in...we stood outside and talked to my cousin for awhile. Then we came back here and I was happy cuz Arik was home...so I talked to him for awhile...and then Lance arrived. I was scared...he came in and wouldnt leave. Finally he did....and I got to talk to Arik for another hour....so about midnight I hoped in the shower...blow dried my hair and went to bed around 1.  Today I had to get up early and be at the highschool at 8:30 for choir and bell practice. It sucked. I was sooo tired. And I couldn't find my parents anywhere. It was nerve racking! But it worked out alright. I played bells...messed up horribly...it was bad...sang in the choir....I was once again the only young person. Im used to it tho...Im the only highschooler in my church choir. So yeah church was alright. Then I looked for my mom afterwards and found out she fell back asleep and didn't get up in time for church....so we came back home and got ready for family pictures. Oh Joy! I really didn't like our outfits...my shirt was huge on me. I looked pregnant! I told everyone that too...eh. So around 1:30 we took pictures and then about 2 we had lunch at the Family Table. My mom, Rachel, Kate,  and I got tired of listening to the guys talk about stupid politics so we went outside and waited...finally we came home. I sat around doing nothing...calling Arik and random times. *sigh* I love hearing his voice...that much in one day. I called him 3 time and he called once. Its great. Im soo glad for phone cards! We both keep chanting...5 more days...*sigh* I can not wait to see him. We get to spend all day together...its gonna be great. Go swimming...shopping...other fun stuff...haha. I can't wait. Anyways so I just got home from cleaning the library a little bit ago...woohoo another 8 dollars...ha. Yeah...so thats the rest of my uneventful weekend....catch ya later.  -Tara
