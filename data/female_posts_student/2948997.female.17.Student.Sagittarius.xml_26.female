I know  alot  of people, and it seems that every I go, I know someone or will leave knowing someone.   But, I don't like people. I know this. I think I like qualities of people but not people...I don't like what people represent.   I have a large amount of friends, a few good friends and a couple people who I love with all my heart.   Lately, I've noticed...it is better to have one close friend then a bunch of false friends.   I love things, but I reject most. Explain that.  Ah, co-worker...I see you on Saturday...where we'll laugh about the 104.00 bills.
