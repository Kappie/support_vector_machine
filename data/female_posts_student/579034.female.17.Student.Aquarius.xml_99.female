Though we are going to the Atrium and I HATE the Atrium but hey it's Erica's b-day night and as long as we are all together the location shouldn't matter. I don't know what we are doing afta but I think we are doing something. Who knows? Not me.  I got to talk to 2 out of the 4 of the Canadians. I talked to Dave and Randy a little while ago. I tell ya they are full of sh-... I mean... awesomness beyond comprehension (just kidding guys x0x).  I've actaully come up with a good story line for a short story. And I know my short stories usually run like 20+ pages but this one seems good and short. It's like, kinda based on a song Erica told me about. Like, this guy breaks up with this girl and he realizes what and idiot he was about it. And it's from a guys point of view so... I guess I'll have my work cut out for me since I am penis-less.   You know what song I love? "Hanging By A Moment", I forgot who sings it but I love that song. It's like been out for mad long but they play it every so often and when they do my love for it just comes right on back. I should download it. I'll do it later.  Well that's all for now. x0x
