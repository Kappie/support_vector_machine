The bad is that I still don't have a date for winter ball. I want to go but I'm really tired of asking people to dances. I really hope we don't have school tomarrow because I have to write an editorial for my journalism class and I haven't even started. Wrestling is so boring you don't even know. I really don't like it so far. It's kinda just a waste of time. Were watching Cast Away in my health class, it's so random. I have no idea why were watching that movie! I got a 9/10 on my math quiz tho, I was sooo happy. Thats like the best I've ever done on a math test. As for my grade in that class, I still have a B, which is good, I'm not complaining. I have a B in my science class also, I think I can get that back up to an A tho. It's a high B. Timeline comes out the 26th, which im soo excited about and Kari and I are going to go see it the day it comes out! Anyway, I should get started on my editorial!  *Kate ~love is like a role that we play
