But I was playing with my Powerbook.  And the iPod, too.  I think I finally have everything working.  Yay.  So, yet another day goes by with no mail.  Nichts.  Nada.  Nothing.  Boo on that.  But at this point I have at least realized that the photo CD I've been anxiously awaiting was probably never mailed, or at least was sent far later than originally planned.  I'm such a fiend for pictures.  Back when I was younger I used to always carry my camera with me, and as a result I have shoe boxes full of pictures.  However, and oddly enough, I have but one far away shot of me during my ho year.  I don't know why that is.  That always kind of disappointed me because they would have been good show and tell when I try to explain to people about the history of Jamie.  I certainly have plenty of pictures of poodle haired, dorky looking freshman year Jamie.  Ah well.  Hmm.  I've realized lately that I start far too many sentences with "So," and "And."  I should work on that.    Okay, off to check the football scores...
