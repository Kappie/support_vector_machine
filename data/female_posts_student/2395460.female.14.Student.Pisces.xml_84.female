You can't argue with a camera and I'm never convinced that I was doing anything wrong; all I can see for sure is that it's a picture of my car. The fact that I probably was speeding doesn't make me feel any better. It all just feels a little dirty and unfair. You can fight back by being really clean, super-shiny clean.    urlLink PhotoStopper  makes your license plate so shiny that using a flash to take a picture of it will result in glare. Without further enhancement of the photo, the license plate numbers will be unreadable. It's not illegal (yet) in most states since the gloss is clear and not obstructing the numbers to the naked eye. At $19.95, it's cheaper than a ticket.
