It seems latly that i have...i try my hardest to be seen or heard....but it's like i'm invisible...is it because i'm not trying hard enuf...or to much that i 'm gettin on everone's nerves....because that's what it seems like...it seems like that's the only reason any one talkes to me is because they have to not because they want to(with the exeption on Matt and Sam)...thanks guys! I don't know what to do....i'm looking at the bright side believe it or not...but it seems like it would have been better for everyone if i had just stayed gone....not like i had a choice...i would much rather be miserable than make someone elses liife miserable....but hey that's just my opinion! Untill later!
