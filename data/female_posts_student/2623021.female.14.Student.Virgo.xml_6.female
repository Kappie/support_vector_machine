I must agree with Felicia on this one, there were a lot of annoying Freshman there, but there were a lot more annoying sophomores there. Prom Queen and King was predictable, it usually is. Although homecoming king and queen and prom king and queen wasn't who I voted for, but hey it's all fun.   You learn things about people everyday. I must say Prom was really fun, I talked to some people who I haven't really talked to since football season. It was a nice change from Red Heart Hop, Homecoming, Winterball where all of the freshman and sophomore guys sit at the side and watch people dance, and barely anyone shows up. AND IT WASN'T AT THE HIGH SCHOOL AND DIDN'T HAVE STUDENT DJ's.  I just realized that it's almost May! 5 days until May which means basically a month of school left, graduation will be so sad, yet it will be nice, So many seniors that I can't wait until they are gone. Our seniors think they are all that, well some of them. I'm just excited for summer, I get to leave this shitty town. Man I can't wait 2 months of complete isolation, well at least from people in this stupid town. My mom wants to move, and I basically am not totally against it. Graduation is sneaking up on me. I've already been to 11 years of school (counting pre-school) I seriously can't wait until until college ASU all the way baby. Well ASU or MMA, most likely MMA, way to go for Crystine Maine.   Nowadays I seriously can't stand anyone. Some of my friends I just plain out don't know anymore, lets see my freshman friends have been annoying me so crazily much, other than that it's pretty dandy, but I did realize that I don't like someone anymore but I do like someone I liked in the past again, at least I think I do. I'm not sure about anything anymore, I really need summer to clear my head. Well adios
