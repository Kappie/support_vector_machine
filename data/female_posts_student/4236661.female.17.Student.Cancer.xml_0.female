It made me feel so proud of him!  i wish i could write free verse now- he's so inspirational! another reason why i think he's so awesome!  I can't wait until wednesday, but I get to see him on monday too! :) i hope we manage to get up close to the stage! even tho i shall be tired, i will NOT sleep on the subway or car or at work to preserve my eyesight, i will!  isn't this ridiculous? i feel like i know someone i never even heard of up to a few weeks before.  but he's great and his entries and songs are so bare-all that anyone who reads them will have a good grip on him. :) MUST go back to Canadian idol on the 1st!  the only bad thing about being there is..well there's a couple- you can't vote unless you run to a payphone (tho it's free, you can't call as much as you would at home), you spend a lot of the performance screaming or listening to the people around you screaming and blocking out the singing, you're too far away (depending on the seats) to see them very well, and you don't know what the judges are saying unitl the last bit, where you either cheer or boo.  good things are- you get to meet them after the show (and they are all GREAT people with lotsa charisma), and they really do sound lots better live than on tv, even tho they sound excellent on tv too). So go check out his entries! you won't be sorry! my next entry will be on the show, even though i know i should have done it before this one...i didn't have much time and i really wanted to get this out before i forgot!
