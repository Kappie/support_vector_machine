Feeling rather down now ... But thanks to  Shiwei  which was here to crap with mi ... lolx ... this let mi feel abit better than just now ..... I was happily chatting with  SOMEONE  which i had alot of trust in him .... but later, he broke my impression towards him ....    Cruel truth or even reality hurts .... Haiz.... Don't know whether i should angry or not... but definetly i got angry just now .... and its really damm angry .....I really trust this guy alot .... treated him as my very good fren and when the truth is that he cheated on mi or can say cheated on us .... i felt really sad and disappointed...... This truth cannot be said ..... "sorry" kinda confidential .....    Called Peiyu and told her about it ..... She was shocked too ..... She was also angry ..... But why do u did such things ..... Or i still dunno the truth ? ..... i hope i dunno it in the first place .... why do u ask mi to go to there and read ? why ? but just one day i will know ... it is just a matter of time .... am i right ....    I guess now only time can fade away all these unhappiness away ... other than that i couldn't think of another way .....    Praying hard that all this could fade away and our friendship will regain its day .... GOD BLESS !!!    [.J.u.S.t.P.a.S.s.I.n.'.B.y.]Signed off at SGT-0008 Hrs
