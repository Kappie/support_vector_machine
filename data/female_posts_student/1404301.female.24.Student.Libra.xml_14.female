I have been fencing for nearly 16 years now and I like to share my knowledge with any person who wants to try. In Adelaide, I joined the  urlLink Adelaide Swords Club  where I fence against children and adults, beginners or not. Back in France, my club is the  urlLink Masque de Fer de Lyon .  Because I enjoy teaching this sport, I decided to complete a Level 1 Coaching Principles at the  urlLink Volunteer and Coach Education Centre Courses  here in Adelaide. It is a day course and I am very excited. I am sure I will enjoy it.  So kids, as Inigo says in the movie "The Princess Bride": "My name is Inigo Montaya, you killed my father, prepare to die!"...Well, in fact maybe just a  bout should be enough!!
