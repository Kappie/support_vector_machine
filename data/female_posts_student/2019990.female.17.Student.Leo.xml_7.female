Paco was awesome, he talked to me, and danced with me, and didn't even complain about the millions of pcitures he had to take.  I was proud.  I felt bad for Agammemnon though, his date ditched him at the after party, and she wouldn't dance with him much at the dance.  The best part was when Aden showed up for pictures only wearing his shoes, pants and shirt.  He couldn't figure out the rest of his tux.  It was so cute, so Paco had to help dress him.  Although Wonder Woman was telling me this morning how her date kept breaking a button on his tux, and sewed it himself.  It didnt' go as well as they had hoped.  Her date also ate some of the crystal ice that decorated the tables.  Pretty sure that that is not edible.  Although he has eaten an entire pizza box before.  Good fiber.  But I'm off to work on my monton de tareja.
