It was in my appartment complex and I was just there watching her in a hold with that shadowy person or thing. I walked towards them after that thing tried to kill her and it disapeared. Mom woke me up cuz she said i was beatin on my pillow. Now, when she woke me up I was okay...then I got outa bed for a water or something and i just start cryin my eyes out! I did't know why-maybe cuz it was Dee being killed or me having to see her being killed by something that didn't exist? Today I found out that the same thing happend to Dee. She couldn't sleep...just lay awake in her bed then she started crying and sayin she missed her friends and she missed me and she wanted her dog(who died a while back ago)Nikki. She was tellin her mom she wanted to go home when she was in her kitchen. We told eachother that we didn't get to sleep peacefully till about 12:00 in the morning. All day I've been feeling miserable tryin not to day dream in class..keeping my eyes opened...their irritated as I type this right now. My dream was bad...really bad and scary. I had to eventually sleep in the livingroom. I swear that I've never had a dream so intense and vivid before. I knew it was Dee suferin in my dream because of the color and length of her hair. I've seen her cry before. I knew it was her.  Could this dream mean something?..I need to check my cards and I'll let anyone who reads this know what it meant. I hope i NEVER have a dream like that again.
