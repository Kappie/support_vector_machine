The hotel is ok I guess, and they have free internet access, which is what I happen to be using at the moment.  Aim Express SUCKS ASS.  Anyways, tomorrow, we'll drive the rest of the way to St. Mary's City, where my mom will drop me off and I'll be for 3 weeks, and she'll drive home.  And I'm sure that it'll be tons o' fun.  We're going to dinner soon at this crab restaurant thingy.  This place is the ultimate Hicksville, and in the middle of nowhere.  I heard that St. Mary's City is kind of like Jamestown.  *shrugs*.  It was only a 4 hour drive, with one rest stop.  There are all of these random baseball players running around in towels coming from the pool.  *wink wink*.  Apparently there's some type of tornement going on.  But they're like 12 though -_-.  But some are older, ;).  Lol.  So that's about it for my life at the moment.  I'LL MISS YOU GUYS!  I'm hoping that I can go online at camp.  *crosses fingers*.  Anyways, you can just call me on my cellphone I suppose.  (610)283-3553  ...la Gu
