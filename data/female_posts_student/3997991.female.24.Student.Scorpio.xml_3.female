Baby's heartbeat was good and I am growing just fine (a little too fine) so we are on the path towards childbirth (AGAIN! Yikes!). I FINALLY made my ultrasound appt. It's for the 26th of August at 10:30! That baby better be in the right position to tell the sex! I am so excited!  Good news: Caden's hair is already coming back. The only remnant of the horrible event left is now a slight buzzer mark above an ear (think Vanilla Ice's cool hair!). He is being a little cranky right now so I think he might be popping another tooth. He ate a few Gerber finger foods Fruit Puffs today. It wasn't the first time he had one, but the first time he put a few in his mouth and actually chomped it up rather than just sucking it and spitting it out. He's on his way!!!  I just started my Stampin Up business and am really excited about that! Email me at  urlLink Stampinupmama@msn.com  if you want to host a party and if you don't know what it is look up  urlLink www.stampinup.com . It's a lot of fun and I have so many ideas for Caden's and Our Wedding's scrapbooks. You can all be expecting to get all SU! cards and gifts from now on.  Michele--Sorry! I don't have any pictures! Can you believe that???? I was too much in shock to get the camera out, but I did remember to save some hair for his baby book. Oh well...next time. I am sure it will be just a fun filled! ;)
