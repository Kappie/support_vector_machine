Last night I had a little birthday bash thing that was last minute, I'm suprised at the number of people who actually showed up.  Lizbeth came... so did Peter and Jessica and Kimmy and Micah and Ertl and Andy M. and Rachel.  It was fun.  We went to the park and played a little frisbee.  Then came back and ate some cake because we couldn't see the frisbee in the dark anyway.  Woo!  Frisbee is in an hour!  I have to get ready!
