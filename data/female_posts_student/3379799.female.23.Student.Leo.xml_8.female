You are right ladies, I have sunken to a new low.  But will discuss that later.  Anyway, he's talking about all the money he makes rapping when it suddnely hit me.  If you are making so much money($3000 a show)why do you still live with your mama?  I mean I hope that his reason for telling this story was to just share his professional lifestyle with me.  But for some odd reason, I think he was lying to impress me.  Move out, buy me something, introduce me to Jay-Z, then I will be impressed.  Anyway, the moral of the story is this:  REAL BALLERS don't chunk thier own rock.  If you are balling out of contorl, let me ask you where you got that Bently from and THEN what you do.  Don't just offer it up.  I am impressed by hard work and honesty, not gold teeth and mama's cooking.  DO BETTER!!
