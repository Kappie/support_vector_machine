I think i sold some to the kizito cookie lady, but i forgot to call her back today. I'll have to do that tomrow. Kevin showed up when we were at senica park, that was really sweet. I went ova to his house after that and did something stupid, cuz i though it might make him happy, but i feel so used cuz i know he doesnt want to date me and we prolly won't get back together, but he still wants to sleep with me. I gave him a really long foot rub, and that didnt make him want to be with me either. we saw the day after tomrow at village 8. after that he expected me to give him head. I didnt even get a back rub, which is all ive been wanting for the last week. we were suposed to chill today, but of course we didn't. I worked 10 hours and my feet really hurt. I want a foot rub with lotion now! $20 says he wont call tomorow. I really wanna go out to lunch with him or something. Hes getting drunk at a party right now. Awsome. Who knows when I'll see him again. I want everything to be good between us again, but I know thats not what he wants. Fuck, ive been crying way too much lately. OMG tomorows the 13th. I wonder if he cares. I miss him so much. I'm gonna go now before i say any more stupid things.
