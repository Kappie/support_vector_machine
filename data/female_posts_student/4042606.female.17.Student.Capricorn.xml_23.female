Ian wanted me to do a favor for him and post once and a while on this website so he can see what is happening with me. Sometimes it is hard for himto get a hold of me on my phone, so I guess I will do him this favor and post. I can't post a lot because of my living situation with Adam and I am not always near a computer. I am mostly outside most of the day because I got a job working on yards and stuff like that. I hope this makes you feel better Ian. It kind of makes me feel a little better too.  I don't really know what else to say, I am not really good at stuff like this. I don't always know what the right thing to say is so I guess I will just end my post now.
