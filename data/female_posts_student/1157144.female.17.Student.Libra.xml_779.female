Neal is gonna be there too, and yeeaaahh. The movies that are showing at the Plaza right now are S.W.A.T., Spy Kids 3D, Johnny English, Legally Blond 2, Terminator 3, and The Matrix Reloaded. Johnny English + Legally Blond 2 are a double feature, and so is Terminator 3 + The Matrix Reloaded; so if we wanted we could see 2 movies for the price of 1. The only thing is that S.W.A.T. doesn't have a matinee price, so if we wanted to see that, then we'd have to pay full price, and yeah. I thought matinee might be coolness since everyone would only have to pay $4 at most, and yeah - if that doesn't sound alright to people, then I can change it and think of something else to do. And yeah...I mainly just want to see y'all again, I've missed everyone so much, honestly. Anyways, take care.
