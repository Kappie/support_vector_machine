I picked up Camille yesterday and went to see Princess Diaries 2, it was OK. I think the first one was better. Camille really enjoyed it, she said it was the best movie ever.   We had some diner at Martys,and then went to the movies. We got home around 9.  Then I showed Camille how to clean out her hamster cage, because frankly I am sick of doing it . I clean it out 2 a week, because if i even smell it I will freak out.  Anyway, she forgets that Usher even exist(hamster) I am really tring to teach her to clean up after herself, because I am just getting sick of picking up after people. I mean how hard is to take off you cloths and put in the hamper. Or how hard is to have a soda and when you are done with put it in the garbage. I mean, i do stuff like this all day, just to keep the house clean. Carl has to be the worst.  we use different bathrooms. And I wanted to see how long it would  before he picked up his pile of cloths from the floor in the bathrrom and put in the hamper, it went a whole week-Mon-Fri, and he still just moved it over. I mean YUCK! He is the worst piggy of all.  Well not much going on today.  I do have a big project that I want to start maybe today. I am going to start going through my cloths and giving away my old stuff, I have way to much cloths, and it's really old stuff that I know I will never wear again.  This project will take me all weekend.
