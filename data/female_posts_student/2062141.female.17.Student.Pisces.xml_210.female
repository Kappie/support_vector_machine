It's fun to type and just never punctuate ever...........  ...Maybe it's cause it's May now, maybe it's cause it's been warm and summery lately, maybe it's cause I hate my classes, maybe it's because it's not Thursday, but.. i'm really hating school... I can't fucking last through the end of the year... SUMMER IS SO CLOSE YET SO FAR. Ga. This summer is going to be SO GREAT.  Camping in my backyard, chillin' at all the parks like everyday, swimming in nasty-butt lake washington, going to seattle, barbeques, driving around, sitting in front of the Thriftway, walking to Baskin Robbins, Mariners games, Camp Burton, summer concerts... Not having school... being the new Seniors.... It'll be the BEST SUMMER EVER. I need to take everyday at a time.  Monday... monday's half over. Yeah. Tomorrow's Tuesday.. I can handle that. Wednesday... sure. Thursday of course. Friday my brain will explode in my restless little body waiting for 2 o'clock. Then the week will be over! Yeah! And there's only like 6 of those left! SHIT
