Chorus: Never underestimate my Jesus. You're telling me that there's no hope. I'm telling you your wrong.  Never underestimate my Jesus When the world around you crumbles He will be strong, He will be strong  I throw up my hands "Oh, the impossibilities" Frustrated and tired Where do I go from here? Now I'm searching for the confidence I've lost so willingly Overcoming these obstacles is overcoming my fear  (Chorus)  I think I can't, I think I can't But I think You can, I think You can I think I can't, I think I can't But I think You can, I think You can Gather my insufficiencies and place them in Your hands, place them in Your hands, place them in Your hands.  (I don't know why I am posting lyrics because you can't actually hear the song, so I find it very pointless. okay, out of my system.)
