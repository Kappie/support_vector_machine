I haven't had much running lately so I expected myself to give up halfway.. All I can do is have a good night's rest and drink sufficient water IN CASE I dehydrate!!  There's also the upcoming a cappella performance that Mr Ong is going to perform in!! I forgotten to hand in the money to the SLs today.. I doubt I will meet them tomorrw but I'll still bring the money along.. If that's so, I'm going to bring a large amount of money with me tomorrow!! HEY!! Robber's out there!! See if you can rob me!! Haha..  I got to go now.. Byebye!!
