I'm getting kind of bored let's get some food and then hit movies 4 what's going on?whats up with all our friends? let's start a rumor just to find out where it ends  cause a small town is like a small stage for teenagers and their drama  instead of playing shows, we'll be showing plays like 90210 without the beverly hills  well, don't you think it's high time what we never settle down well, don't you think it's high time that we get out of this town cause if we leave then we just might be okay  hoopes i did it again i messed everything up, and i think i hurt my friends hoopes i did it again relationships that work are things that i can't comprehend  ohio has the flavor of a water chestnut it's not too crazy and it's not the best but we're not setting forest fires just out of boredom i'd rather see a movie if in fact i can afford one  well, don't you think it's high time that we never settle down well don't you think it's high time  that we get out of this town cause if we leave then we just might make a difference and if we leave then we just might be okay and i don't think it would hurt to get away  dan bakitus said i'm shallow he said i've got no integrity but, i don't know dan bakitus and dan bakitus, he don't know me  cause we always sayin canton you can't enoy(canton joy) yourself well, there's thruth to that but may i add it's not half bad and never less than that.
