Dani had gone 2 a concert so i definatly wasnt expecting them to end up coming and i didnt think they were hanging out w/ Dave so that was another big suprise. He's so funny he showed up playin his harmonica, and when he throws the ball he throws it so freakin hard the all the pins go flying. Overall i had a good time. I really suck at bowling but i was good that one time so i'll hold on to that, i bowled like 120 and ever since then i havent even been close to breakin a 100 which kills me because i HATE LOSING!!! But obviously i had a good night. Then i slept over @ Chrisitna's house and we finishes watching Down With Love, and Ewan McGregor was sooo Hot in that movie, he was just as Hot as he was in Moulin Rouge. Christina wa talkin to Fisher on the phone and now i remember y i dont like him, he is such a prick to me, he pisses me off sooooooo much, it's really weird, i dunno something bout that kid really sets me off and i dont think it's just that fact that he hates me for no reason. Oh well who gives a rats ass about him ne ways. Well next weekend should be eventful, we're gonna go 2 my grandma's church's picnic on one day and somewhere else on Saturday, so i guess friday is the only day i can do something so yea lol that sucks b/c i really dont wanna go to my grandma's thing lol, so that's all for now later.
