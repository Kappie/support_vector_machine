(I'm using this in the sense that it generally is in western society; discrimination against Jews, not Jews and/or Arabs, which is the technical meaning of 'Anti-Semite'.) I actually love Jewish culture and I admire Judaism as a religion. Heck, at certain times in the past I've considered becoming a Jew.   Anyway!  I'm sitting in the coffehouse; sipping my coffee at a table. On the table, I have my books; a French synonym dictionary, and Jean-Paul Sartre's  ? Les Jeux Sont Faits ? , meaning, 'The Game Is Up', in the French. At that time, two Jewish gentleman walk in, evidently they have planned to eat lunch together. One I know is Jewish from previous conversations, and the other is wearing a  yarmulkah,  so I assume he is an Orthodox Jew. As the yarmulkah'd guy regards the table at which I am sitting, he sees the book.   He walks over and asks, "What is the title of that book?" "It's  Les Jeux Sont Faits ," I said, "By Jean-Paul Sartre."  He points to the word 'faits' in the title. "What does that word mean?"  "It means 'done'," I reply.  "So what does the whole title mean?"  "The Game Is Up."  "OH!" He exclaims. "Jeux means  games . How do you say 'Jew' in French?"  It is at this moment that I realise that he has inadverdently translated the title as 'The Jews Are Done'. "Umm... Juif."  "Oh! That's right.  Juif.  Merc?, merc? beaucoup."   LOL Oh boy. I was almost mistaken for an anti-semite. Damn Sartre and his ambiguous-when-looked-at-in-another-language-because-of-false-cognates-story-titles!! (Don't get me started on the misunderstandings I've seen people have over  Les Mouches .)   -Ian
