Hmmm, my immigration final is on friday and I  have my debtor creditor take home essay "What did you learn in my class?" due next tuesday. But on  brighter note, Happy B-Day A.  I miss you.  And congrats to Mindy, who went to the "Fund." in Toledo with me in 2002, SHE´S GETTING MARRIED.  Ah, I remember many wonderful bonding moments over Sangría hearing about her man Tim and now they are gettin´hitched.  CONGRATS!          This computer is actually a pentium two, so basically a dinosaur without a USB plug for my memory stick, which contains some good, some bad, some very bad, and some just downright crazy pics from Barcelona.  Hmm I guess ya´ll will have to wait.  And if anybody knows of a pimped out job, one of my friends is now looking, so please let me know.  Moving right along I skipped class today, wow, that is just amazing.  Proof of my illness and ill-fated hair.  Anyway, so I was out dealing with mail when everyone got back from class, and apparently started calling my room, my roomate was funny about it, kinda cool to know that people noticed I wasn´t there and missed me.  Anyway, I don´t think I am dying of Stomach Ebola, but maybe.  It is possible.  But, if so I wish I were dying in Roma instead, in Gucci.  HAHA- take care. I will now go on an internet café hunt for a USB equipped comp.           P.S. did anybody see the Spain game, that was some messed up stuff, huh?
