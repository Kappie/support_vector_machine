While it was almost a year ago, I still sit here with tears streaming down my face with Sheryl Crow's song "I Still Believe" playing in my head.  It still feels like it was just yesterday that I heard those painful words flow from your mouth.  To you, it was nothing--a walk in the park.  I feel like someone or something has turned my whole life upside down.  And there's nothing I can do about it.  I reach out, offer a smile, and friendly hello every once in a while.  I feel stuck and abandoned.  When I see you, I freeze and tremble.  It was so difficult for me today to give myself to God.  It was so hard.  It took all the strength inside of me to remain sane and refrain from bawling my eyes  out with you there.  But I'm glad you were there.     What is hanging on to this accomplishing? Nothing, because I know it will never be received and returned.   I'm asking for your friendship.  It's what you offered me so long ago and I screwed things up with my feelings.  Still, the closure I seek is not apparent.  I just don't know how to do this anymore, that is, living in this madness of reaching for  the unattainable.  You are like the wind to me--I feel you strongly but I can't grasp  you.   I don't know what to do.  It is just so painful  to me.  I can't take it anymore.  I feel like my heart has just been ripped out of me.  And I  don't blame you; for some reason, I am mad at myself.  And no one around me understands what a powerful impact you have had on my life, and for it to be instantly taken  away  left my face down in the dirt.   Please let me know that you forgive me for having my heart in the wrong place.  I just feel broken, and even after almost a year, I don't know how to put myself back together.  Gosh, I  hope you read this and understand that I'm talking to you.  I have had a strong inclination  to do something, and this is all I  can think of to do.  I miss you.  I'm sorry.  Truly.  "I Still Believe" ~Sheryl Crow Come to me now And lay your hands over me Even if it's a lie Say it will be alright And I shall believe  I'm broken in two And I know you're on to me That I only come home When I'm so all alone But I do believe  That not everything is gonna be the way You think it ought to be It seems like every time I try to make it right It all comes down on me Please say honestly you won't give up on me And I shall believe And I shall believe  Open the door And show me your face tonight I know it's true No one heals me like you And you hold the key  Never again would I turn away from you I'm so heavy tonight But your love is alright And I do believe  That not everything is gonna be the way You think it ought to be It seems like every time I try to make it right It all comes down on me Please say honestly You won't give up on me And I shall believe I shall believe
