I blinked past the wetness of white and lights, Some sat down, some slumped against walls, Choking as all spirit fled us, Unable to stand and muster a farewell to This gentle soul into the night. And then the line went meekly straight, I looked upon he who laid ashen, Still as the gripping cold of the room. Behind him the machines wept and breathed, Into veins curdled, Into lungs drowned. The sickle had reaped This gentle soul into the night. And then the line went meekly straight, As it should have some time ago, If not for comrades that have kept the semblance Of a living heart, with tired arms and bent backs. We have seen more deaths than we care to know. But, we men and women, now pained to the pith, Will always remember the passing of This gentle soul into the night.
