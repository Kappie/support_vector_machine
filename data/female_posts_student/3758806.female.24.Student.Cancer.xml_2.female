I'll plug that tomorrow, though.  I'm sleepy and feel a tiny bit shameful because I voted for Paul Martin (lesser of two evils)... and for now  I feel like talking about a comedian who really embarrassed me at a show tonight... Yikes!   We went to Montreal's biggest comedy club , which is a block and a half away from my apartment, only for me to get called up on stage and have him realize  I'm 5'9"  (6'0 with the heels I was wearing)  towering over his 5'6"...  he then called me "Freaky Amazon Woman"  (ok, let's not go crazy).  He asked me for my measurements, that was annoying... What was even more annoying was that Crystal gave them to him to share with the audience.  Then there were the hoots and the hollers and he smacked my butt (I can play along with the jokes, but sir, don't touch my bum please!), told the audience it was firm (I was annoyed... and smug).. he then said I was tense and asked me when was the last time I had sex (don't rub it in!  I'm single and I'm just not that kind of girl!), asked me what I'm doing with "grandpa" (my  friend  Jean Michel, who is only 36 which is age appropriate for me anyway!) and then, distracted by Crystal's car-alarm laughter, moved on to her.... Thank goodness!...   Anyway, he was bad.  There is a shortage of really good comedians out there... And the good ones only come here once a year for the Just For Laughs Festival.  Luckily, we get to occasionally watch the really awesome comedians, like  Juston McKinney  on  Jay Leno  *  My plans to go to NYC are coming together nicely, while my plans to go to LA at the end of July are falling apart!  Gaah!  Mel's going to be in Amsterdam so I can't stay there (don't worry though Mel, you're still welcome to stay here during the Just For Laughs Festival)... So I have to find out what two nights at an LA hotel are going to cost me (my soul?).  American dollars make me cringe!    *Juston McKinney will be on Jay Leno with Ben Stiller on Thursday, July 1st 2004 11:35/10:35 on NBC    ... Yes, I realize that's Canaday Day, but I'll probably pop a video in the machine while I'm doing the improv.   In tomorrow's post, I will promote myself shamelessly!
