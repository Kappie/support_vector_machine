God, forgove me, but I hate her. How can she do this to me? I don't think anyone else is even going to be able to take her place. It's going to cost hundreds of dollars more to change the name on the airline ticket and the cruise line people said there are penalties involved, but we don't know what they are yet. I asked Noelle if she could come with me, but she's not home right now, so she's going to ask her mother when she gets home. I hope everything works out, because if it doesn't, I will lose about one thousand dollars. I paid for Deanna to come on this trip with me. She always does things like this. I can't take it anymore. And she didn't even have the nerve to call me herself. She had her mother call me and tell me she can't go. I can't believe her mother didn't even offer to give me anymoney! That's one thousand dollars down the freakingdrain! Deanna really sucks. She's so lazy and selfish.I'm so disappointed in her. She screws up everything. She's going to be such a failure in life. She neverputs effort into anything.Oh, I'm sorry, she does put effort into getting drunk and getting high and skipping school and getting in trouble and being rude to people and being lazy and disrespecting her mother and being careless and being forgetful and getting involved with guys who beat her up and cutting herself and wasting all her money on drugs and cigarettes and ditching peopleand letting her friends down. Yup, that's Deanna, my best friend. So much for all the time and effort I've put into our friendship. She could care less about me. I don't know why I keep trying to convince myself that she really likes me and wants to bemy friend. She puts no effort what so ever into our relationship. And then she cries when I talk about going to college in Virginia. She says she's going to miss me so much. Yeah right! If she really cared about me, she wouldn't treat me like shit. Iregreteverything I have ever done for her. I feel like she doesn't appreciate any of it. How can she do this to me? I hate her so much. I can't help it. I really hate her. I know that's a sin and I'm so sorry for feeling this way, but it's how I feel and Ijust can't help it. Deanna is nothing but a loser. She can't do anything right. I'm sick of putting up with her. I need to let go and realize that maybe this friendship just wasn't meant to be. I've been friends with her for so long that I guess I'm just scared of losing her. But I think it's time to let go. I need to move on. I have so many friends that treat me so much better than she does, but I still call her my best friend. I'min denial. She is not a best friend. She's far from it. I need to accept that. I'm not going to call her or anything. I know she probably won't try to contact me. She never does. Especially now that something so huge happened. I'm going to leave for college in less than a month and if I don't talk to her by then, oh well. It's her loss. I have given her so much. It was all for nothing. She's a loser. If she keeps living her life the way she is now, she isn't going to have a life at all. She's going to be a bum on the street or she's going to die. She has no sense.I care about her so much that I wind up being hurt by thestupid mistakes that she makes. I need to get myself out of this before something really bad happens. I shouldn't have to deal with her problems. This is going to be very hard because I really do love her and I'll miss her so much, but it's whatneeds to be done. She just doesn't feel the same way about me. She doesn't really take friendships seriously. Five years down the drain. We have been best friends for five years. What a waste. I feel so stupid. I feel small and helpless.I don't know what I'm going to do now. I really hope Noelle can go on the trip with me. Itall depends on whether or not we can pay the extra money. I'm prettysure Noelle's mother will let her come with us. I really don't want to go without a friend. It'll be so freaking boring! My dad and Margo will haveeach other, Pat and Laurawill have each other, and Kylie and Erin will have each other. And I'll be all alone. I know I won'thave a good time. It'll suck. Mary better give me theextra money if I need it. It's my money. Anyway, I'm going to go rest for a while. Maybe I'll take a shower to help me relax. I'm a mess. I cried so hard when I was on the phone with Deanna's mother and she didn't even seem to have any sympathy for me. Shejust kept telling meit's Deanna's fault, not her's. I'm so angryright now. I can't believe this is happening. I never thought it would come down to this.
