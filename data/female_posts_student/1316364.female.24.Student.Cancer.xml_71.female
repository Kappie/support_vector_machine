So when I got to work I quickly logged on to the Internet and found him on Yahoo, just like he told me he would be. I sort of wished he had been home so I could have celebrated with him, but after all I did get to talk to him online and even a little bit on the phone (he called me at work). It was so nice to hear his voice.   Last night I decided to do a search online to see what I could find regarding the Sacramento based 319th Signal Battalion. I found a whole bunch of links and decided to do some research. There were a few news articles from local area newspapers. They included partial interviews with family members of the 319th. After reading a few I wondered if my day would ever come where I would be contacted regarding my husband and asked for an interview although I am not to sure as to what I would tell them. I also came across a weblog from a member of the 319th   urlLink http://missick.com/ , newly appointed Sgt Chris Missick. He has some wonderful pictures of Kuwait on his site and itâ€™s a great place to read a little about the things a soldier would write about. I actually have to wonder if anyone else in the 319th has a blog going, it would be interesting to see what types of things they write about during their free time.  Other than that nothing new is going on. I am just living each day and my drive is knowing that with each passing day it brings me one-step and day closer to seeing Jesse again.
