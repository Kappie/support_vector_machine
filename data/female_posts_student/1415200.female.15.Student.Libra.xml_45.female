After I posted earlier, I went for a very looong walk. For like 2 hours I was gone. I was down in the bottom, in the woods..haha I was running from the people on the quads! It was crazy-hu-ha-hu-hu-ha! I hate the way I am. I hate being so funny, and so loud. I hate it. I wish I was more quiet and serious about alot of stuff. I wish I was more studious. People can't take me seriously. I can't take my self seriously. Maybe that's the reason I can never get a boyfriend. They have infurity complexes when Im around, because Im so loud. Guys always have to be the center of attention.  I dont know what I could do to change that though. I mean I can't just change in a snap. Things take time. I never seem to have anytime. I hate this shiz. -*argh*- Oh well.  I think Im going to go on a scary movie marathon! I need one! I love those movies.  Oh, snap jesus, that kid has kicks. I need to read more some more of Edgar Allen Poe. He was such a genious for his time. He creates such atmosphere, and dramatities with words. 'The Cask of Amantillado.' Its very good. You can learn a thing or two about revenge in that short story. 0o; Well ima go. I need something. I dont know what yet. If you kno, let me know. I'll love you 4-lyfe!! Okay. Nevermind I've got something else to complain about.  I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. Yes, That's right folks. I do. I dont care anymore. I am going to go far away. Maybe Cocoa Beach. That way I can live on the beach, surf, and go to school, where the people dont know me and everything would be all fine an dandy. I can't wait until I drive. I can just get up and go. I dont care, and I doubt you do.  Oh, snap jesus, that kid gots kicks!!
