Today sunny comes in. actually, he should be home, here, in a couple of minutes! i'm very excited and i hope this time we get to hang out more, because all the other times he didn't. anyway. i recently discovered the wonders of cocoa butter-- go buy some. it's amaaazing. last night i had a weird dream.... we were in the future, right? and staying in my room was some weird lady from the movie cold comfort farm, and daniel radcliffe. in jordans room, the one i'm sleeping in right now, tom felton was sleeping. i mostly paid attention to dan though. tom slept a lot. i was on the steps talking to him, but he was twelve again. so i picked him up and kissed him on the cheek and forehead, and said how cute he was. we went down to the kitchen with uncle dan and my aunt jane, and mary, and dad, and then our house, which is apparently mobile, left. so we're like, dang it, we have to get them at the mall. so we walked around the mall, and dan became fifteen again. and we kissed on the stairs. and went into these expensive stores which actually had some thrifty items. i remember a pair of earrings with beavers that had blue stars on it's tail. anyway, so then, there is this ride in the mall, and dan goes in it and disappears. so we go searching for him. i think i run into tom and we made out or talked or something. and then, the mall was about to close, and we NEEDED to find daniel. i think, the whole family separated, and we all found eachother in the end. it was very odd. the mall reminded me of valley view at certain times, but it had some futuristic touches to it. bizarro. anyway, it was weird how i liked dan more than tom. everyone knows i love tom. but dan was SO NICE to me in the dream. it was weird. i'm going to go, i'm watching music videos and mulling over that... dream.
