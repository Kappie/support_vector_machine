I'd lock my hands behind my head     I'd cover my heart and hit the deck     I'd brace myself for the impact if I were you          (It's a long wait) is there anything     (For an answer) worth looking for     (Is there any news) worth loving for     (Is there any word) worth lying for     (Is there trauma) is there anything     (Or a struggle) worth waiting for     (Am I missing) worth living for     (Was the body found) worth dying for
