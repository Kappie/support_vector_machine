A kind of respect and trust that shouldn't even be questioned, how can I open my heart with dishonesty sitting next to me?  I've honoured your honour to the point of embarrassment, but innocence in the hands of the guilt-free is kicked to, is kicked to the curb  I was ashamed of my innocence, I was ashamed of my innocence but now with clarity I see that your bullshit is just not worthy of me   Chorus  I don't want to be angry.... This is not worthy of me and now with clarity I see that I can walk away, I can walk away
