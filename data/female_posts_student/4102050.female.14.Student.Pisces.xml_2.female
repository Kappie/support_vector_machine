Be myself as much as possible 2. Smile all that I can 3. Don't get in people's way 4. Tell people what you think of them, if they ask 5. tell the truth when people ask for it 6. Try to be happy with the choices I make, and make the right ones, the ones that will not hurt someone else  I think that is good. That sounds like everything I do wrong, so maybe now I can do stuff right and not hurt people's feelings. I spent the entire day just sitting on the couch reading. Wow! I am tired right now. Well, I am going to leave you to yourself, so that you can come up with some thing else to do besides read my boring posts.  ♥Jeanne♥
