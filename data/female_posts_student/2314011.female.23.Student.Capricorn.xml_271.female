It was so intense.    "I'll talk to Mary Jane about it," she said pleasantly, making a reminder-Post-It note.     Damn right you will.     Cut to 7 hours later as I prepared to board the precarious elevator to the depths of the library's basement and said boss made her way into the mail room.  "Oh! I talked to Mary Jane about..."  "Oh right..." I said, preparing myself for the inevitable "...and you're screwed" speech, but hoping for the "...and we raised you to the $8.50 we said you'd get to begin with" because really, she  has  changed.    "and I was able to bump you up to $10."  ......   SAY SOMETHING!   "OH!  Great!  Thanks!"  So yea...for the next three weeks (one and a half pay periods), I'll be making big bucks.  Sweeet.    Finally in for the night, which feels nice.  Thought about going to The Grind for a bit to edit Miss Q's homework, but the thunder/windstorm changed my mind.  So we'll just have to make do with some yoga and Harry Potter in an apartment that smells like rain.  Shucks.  And what.the.fuck is the goddamn deal with all my hot accessories being shoved down to the bottom of the page?!
