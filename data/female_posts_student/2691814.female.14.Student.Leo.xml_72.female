I just got back from Francesca's house...fun fun fun!It really was...we went walking at night with Buffy and Spike(dogs) and watched Final Destination 2, Idle Hands, and Once Bitten. We stayed up till 7in the morning talking and watching movies and on the internet. So anyway...Theres not too much to talk about since i just got home.    I'm pretty tired so i'll be posting later.
