A couple of weeks ago, I was fortunate enough to get a house-sitting assingment for a friend, who is so very kind enough to pamper her friends by outfitting her guest suite with a Tempur-Pedic foam mattress from  urlLink Brookstone .  I have to say, I have not had a more restful night's sleep in the last decade.    Developed for NASA, "the visco-elastic foam in Tempur-Pedic mattresses molds itself to your body shape to evenly distribute weight and eliminate pressure points, which has been proven to improve sleep and increase the level of deep sleep, so you wake up more alert, refreshed and better rested."  Sleep is such a personal thing, it only seems logical that a mattress that customizes itself to the individual would be so perfect.  And it was!  Stop by your local  urlLink Brookstone  for a test nap!
