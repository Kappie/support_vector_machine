I just thought that i post up 2 many pics and that i should really be typing more Useless fact: Humans eat at least 6 spiders in a lifetime (in their sleep *duh*) Is it quantum theory or relativity? I'm not very sure........i think i'm more on quantum theory's side..cuz i'm that kind of person who believes in that kind of stuff.....but then again i believe in lots of stuff like being able to write poetry and fantasy books about elves, bow and arrows, magic, god and goddesses.....  I think i'll write and Acrostic poem:  Dare to imagine Reality is unknown Each one in an Abstract way My world
