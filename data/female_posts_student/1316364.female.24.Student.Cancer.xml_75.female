Let’s just say what I thought to be allergies turned out to be a strange viral infection that took over my throat, tongue and mouth, leaving a trail of nasty ulcers. My Doctor said it was probably Herpes Simplex which is caused by stress. I am beginning to think so. I had tons of Homework to catch up on since I left to see Jesse 2 months back. Any way I am so glad I caught up and at the same time got better.   I haven’t talked to Jesse since Friday Morning. He hasn’t been online either. I am not to sure what he has been up to but I am sticking to my motto, no news is better than bad news. I hope he pops back in real soon though, his package is set to arrive in Navistar real soon and I would hate to have it not reach him.   In other news, I feel that the FRG has slowly but surly fallen apart. We were never an organized bunch but I feel as if there is no rhyme or reason to the effort and that is becoming a waste of everyone’s time, not just mine. I guess my original plan of staying busy to pass the time will have to go back, or in this case remain, into affect. I signed up for 13 units next fall and I know that the courses I signed up for will require me to spend a lot of time hitting the books and less time worrying about Jesse.   I know he will be fine I just hate not hearing from him.   I hope he is fine.
