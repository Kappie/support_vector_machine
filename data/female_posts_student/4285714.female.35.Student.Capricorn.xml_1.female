He said the only reason that he filed for divorce before he left is because I had mentioned doing it myself and he felt like he needed to in order to protect himself but he didn't actually want a divorce. In fact he was very adament via phone calls and e-mails to his lawyer that it be dropped immediately once he found out that I was just bluffing. Yeah, bad me....I know! I never claimed total innocence in this relationship, I only claimed to not know WHAT I actually did this time.  I don't have a hard time believing that my sister may have actually been the one who made the move on C and is just trying cover her tracks (by putting the blame on him) in case he has told me about it. That could also be why she hasn't called me since she went back home...all of the phone calls between us since then have been instigated by me.  I don't think that she would have said anything bad about me to C that would have pissed him off at me because #1: what the hell would she say? (maybe I am more naive than I realize) and #2 I don't think he would believe her anyway........he knows me. (or so I thought)  I  have  asked him what is bothering him and why he is mad at me in e-mails and in person, with the e-mails I get no response at all and in person as I said...he won't even look me in the eye, he just rolls his eyes and pisses me off which makes matters worse. Not sure how many ways there are to get a man to talk but either of the above would have worked for me.  As for the being self sufficent comment..............and don't think I've taken offense....I haven't at all! BUT..........oooh...there's the big BUT........... I have always played a major contribuitory factor in this marriage. In fact, he lived with ME when we first got together and I paid ALL the bills. Then after we married I worked full time as a dental assiastant bringing home $520.00 a week (not a whole lot but still a contribution) and also put child support ($1000) into our mutual funds. Even after my surgeries I was receiving unemployment almost equal to my pay, and I received that for almost a year. Our money was always combined so his numerous lawyer fees to go back to court with his ex-wife and paying off his uncle sam debt from his prior marriage was also paid in part with my money, I don't think it's so much to ask that he hold down the fort in my time of need after having had 3 major surgeries. I also don't think that it's too much to ask that he help pay my college expenses seeing as we will both benefit from the outcome. Which if you will remember was the plan after we purchased a home.  Our money only started being in individual accounts after he filed for divorce last year and it just seemed more convenient that way so we left it. I can't actually say that he cut me off from the checking account because I wasn't on it to begin with but...........I did have a credit card to his checking account at my disposal until it all of a sudden disappeared which he denies any part in. I say he has "cut me off" because prior to his not speaking to me he always made sure that I had money required for expenses and etc. Then last week I log into his bank account as I have always done and he has changed his passwords so that I am not able to get into his account anymore. Seems pretty fishy to me when combined with the rest of the circumstances.  He came in again this eveing around 7 pm and the same thing......stood at his truck drinking. It will only be a matter of time, I'm sure, until someone in the Homeowners association has something to say about this.  Again........not a single word spoken between the two of us. Maybe I am being hard headed here but I have tried on numerous ocassions to get him to talk to me but I am NOT going to beg. Sorry! Just not going to do it and that's just how it is.  Well..........once again, a long rambling post but I feel better each time I get on here and rant so maybe the blog was a good idea...it may save my sanity!! :o)  Ta for now....Dawn
