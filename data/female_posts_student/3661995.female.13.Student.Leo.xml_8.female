I hate the English project, and the teacher along with it...    I still have a lot of homework... is this a holiday or what? I'm buried under a heap of work, I can't even enjoy myself!    And I really dislike Jia Ying... she is that annoying... Geez... I swear, that girl needs to GET A LIFE!!! She really irks me with all her phone calls! I really regret giving her my number... Can I sue her for harrasment? I wonder how her family stands her.... I would have killed her by then...     My mother is also equally irritating... she likes to complain about me; how I always don't listen to her, don't do my work, keeps on playing, how I don't talk to other people much...    God! That woman is seriously crazy! What's wrong with not doing my work now? It's the holidays!    Anyway, I have to go now... must finish project... By the end of the holidays, i probably will become a ZOMBIE!!!
