And now I'm REALLY scared that Marsha isn't going to let Katelyn read my blog anymore because of what that word means to you Canadians - sorry Marsha! Let me just say that scanky is a totally safe word here and just means rubbish, old, yucky.  so when I said scanky computers I wasn't meaning anything dodgy!!  Let me explain the points system: basically James and Lizzy and I are doing this thing, whereby we get a point if we say or do something positive towards ourselves, if we admit that we are ok people, if we believe that someone likes us. But if we think/say we are rubbish and put ourselves down, or deny that anyone could possibly ever like us then we lose a point. The winner is obiviously the one at the end of the term with the most points.  I can't believe it but Katelyn, despite living with the apparent queen of ER, doesn't know what the ER rules are. so for the benefit of her and any other fortunate others who haven't been subjected to them here they are: 1. No talking except in the adverts (although Melanie has slackened a bit and said you can say one-liners) 2. No questions except in the adverts 3. No criticisms of the medical aspects of the programme at ANY time and then there are optionally extras like sitting in the total dark.  I can sort of understand the first two, but no criticisms - the programme just asks for it really.  i mean don't get me wrong I like the show but what sort of programme puts 2 med students in a NICU?!! Ok I'll shut up now Debs. So I think I'll have to take a gag with me to Canada in order that I'm not deported!   well this is it folks, my last blog for a while (yipee I hear them cry) I was just reading through Platinumblonde's old blogs and she is just SO eloquent and witty in her blogs. She makes really mundane, everyday, boring things sound funny and exciting. she obviously just has the gift of the gab! [in the nicest possible sense!]  So think of me spending the next week at Butlins with 300 5-7yr olds!  I'm actually REALLY looking forward to it. Have everything ready - including my paint-splodged dungarees (canadian translation: overalls), my wellies (what do you call them?), my supply of food, a clothes horse to make into a cool doorway into our den, some old sheets and pegs to make the den, and tons of other stuff too.    Off now to pack the car and do my ironing.  Ok guys take care of yourselves.
