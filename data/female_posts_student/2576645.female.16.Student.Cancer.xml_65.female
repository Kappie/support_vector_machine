For instance, you may see one (one? psshh.. try one  hundred ) of these:      *shivers* EEEEEEEEWWWWWW   I actually ventured down to Heritage Landing for the first time since it started. Yup... Kool  The Gang. (not fimiliar? Hits: 'Celebration', 'Get Your Back Up Off The Wall')   But as we all know, no one goes to the concerts to hear the washed up disco bands.... ooohhh no. We all go to walk around and eat carni food. Which is the best part.  Okay, not the walking. I mean, EXERCISE?? I think not.  But the thing that gets me is that people (mainly, my disillusioned sister and my sister's disillusioned friends) buy passes for a week, but only use them to walk around. Guess what? You can do that for free on our treadmill. No joke! I'll turn it down extra slow so that you can talk and I'll just stand here next to you listening. What... don't give me that 'but its not the same'! Here, I'll turn on the oldies station and spray some bad cologne. See? Its just like your're really there!!  But I have no complaints about the carni food. Nope, none whatsoever. "Pile the cheese on those nachos m'am. But could you please avoid dropping one of your teeth into them? I have noticed that you must have some rare gum disease, concluding the lack of molars in your mouth. You only have a precious few left! Lets keep that mouth of yours shut tight, as not to lose anymore further."  ****  hey, I'm not gonna do the 'song of the day' thing anymore. I don't think anyone cares, and I think lyricsondemand.com may start charging me for my excessive use.   But to entertain yourself, I hand picked  urlLink this  especially for  you .
