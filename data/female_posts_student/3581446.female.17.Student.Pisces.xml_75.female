"Getting up early" is not in my best interests.  I mean, I'M SORRY IF I DON'T GO ON TEN MINUTES OF SLEEP EVERY NIGHT!  Chew on that one for awhile, Duckshirt.  I'd tell you guys about the A Perfect Circle concert I went to (in detail), but supposedly I have some kind of limits to the kind of words I can say and the kind of things that I can talk about.  You know, this Blog is supposed to be suitable for human beings and all.  Anywho, I need to find some kind of edible (sp?) substance.  Prolly cereal.  Later.
