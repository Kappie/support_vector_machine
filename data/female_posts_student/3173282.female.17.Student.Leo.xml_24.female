It started to rain on monday and the campground turned into an absolute quagmire! Haha that's my dad's word and i love it. But it is a real word. Sounds like a Hillary word to me! This week is better. I put people in their places and have attempted to make things okay with others. Whether they are okay, i dont know. It's hard to tell. The most unlikely people can turn the other way suddenly, and the most unlikely can turn right back around. It's a fun game. Not really, ho's!!! I love dustin kern. He signed my yearbook so ultra-cooly. Justin is going to sleep now to dream about my cute little face.....aww how dreamy! I wish i could pack him up and take him back to washington with me. Justin, you are my bestest friend here, i love ya! Omg! the new Harry Potter movie comes out on friiiiidaaay! YAY! And hillary might not be coming cuz her mom is sick but her mom can suck it up! hehe, u better come hill, or i will flip shit! Ok i suppose its sleepy time for little girls. Good night!
