There was a big difference between the movie and the book, but still I could find some similarities between them. At first, I could see the main character named Marlow, and he has same personality in the movie as in the book. He didn't talk much, I think he liked to quiet, but did only when he needed. Also the place where the stroy takes was same, where was in the Africa. I didn't read the book much, so I don't understand the character and the background clearly, but still I could findsome similarity. I wondor why don't they makemore similarties in themovie as book that readers can understand easily when they saw the movie.
