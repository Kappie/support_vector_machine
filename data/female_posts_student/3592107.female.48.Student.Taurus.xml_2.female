(what fun)lol I took a nap after that and didn't wake up til like 5:50 or almost 6. I watched a little Law and Order SVU as usual. I had to take a shower because I had been playing with Legs (Skylar's dog)and he don't smell that great.lol! So now I am talking to Jera and Turry. Well, I am fixing to go watch some more Law and Order Criminal Intent. So c ya'll later! Peace
