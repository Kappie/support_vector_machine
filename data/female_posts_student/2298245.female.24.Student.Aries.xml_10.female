It's just getting to be crunch time here for me at law school, so I don't really have the time.  It isn't stopping me from doing it now, of course, and probably won't stop me from updating occasionally throughout the day, but since I'm not sure if anyone is even reading this, I won't feel that bad if I don't get to it.  Mainly it's an outlet for me anyway, and if I don't have the time, then I'm the one who's getting hurt.  And yes, in case you were wondering, it really is all about me.  Now back to work.  I'm outlining for my tax class, trying to see if I really know anything from the massive amount of material we covered in class.  So far, I've done pretty well in school, but this class may be the one that does me in.  Or it may just be one of those things that I have to let go.  Hopefully, after a day spent in the library agonizing over the Internal Revenue Code, I will have a better handle on it.  'Til then...
