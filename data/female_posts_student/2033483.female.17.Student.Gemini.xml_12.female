Countdown to new house is now at 5 days, but since most of the computers are getting packed tonight this might be the last entry for awhile that is undetermined as of now though.  I took a nap around 3 ish, naps are so wonderful!  Although I'm still not feeling my greatest.   When I came back from the mall last night I packed some more and watched stand up on comedy central.  I was laughing so hard at this guy...He was talking about church and when he went up to communion he called the body of Christ the "cruton o' Christ"...That cracks me up, hahaha!    I was bored so I decided to go online and read some blogs and see what was has been going on in my friends lives for the last week or so.  I was going in and out of folders when I came to Brad Dawson's blog.  My response to your comment on the incline of bogger users is:   1.  You're very immature if you're going to stop using a blog just because others are now using one.  2.  But if you  don't  like reading my blog, you  don't  have to .  Simple as that!  *thinking*  I don't feel very good.  I'm very tired.   I suppose I'll go to church tomorrow, but no confirmation so this makes me happy.  Although it is a lot better this year than previous years and to make it even better it's my last year!  I like having the O'Gorman kids with us, it makes for different people to look at.  Note*: Renae it's costing me $16 to get my bag fixed.  It's okay, I know it was an accident.  And you will not get a cold from being cold!  If I stay on for much longer I'm going to start babbling more about things people really don't care about or don't need to know.
