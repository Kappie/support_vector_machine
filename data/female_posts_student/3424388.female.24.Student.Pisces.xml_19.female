Wanting to see what the gov has to say, naturally, I visited the U.S. Copyright Office's site and conducted a search for "blog."  I get one hit - a pdf document commenting on a case involving DVD's and CSS.  Not quite what I was looking for.  Seems to be a bit of a time lag between the real world, the government, and, lastly, government-affiliated webpages - shocking.  So then I started thinking about the  Creative Commons logo I saw the other day on a witty, informative blog,  urlLink LawGeek   , and quite a while back on  urlLink Lawrence Lessig's blog  (I actually cited the LawGeek blog in a management paper I wrote today!  That was an enjoyable first.)  I knew a bit about the  urlLink Creative Commons  from  urlLink EFF , though I don't know much at all about IP issues.  After doing some marketing work for two law firms, I developed a severe disinterest in the law.  Still, that doesn't excuse me from being an informed cyber citizen.  I wish I had more time, and I wish I remembered what I read and where I read it.          But the information overload rant is for yet another post.
