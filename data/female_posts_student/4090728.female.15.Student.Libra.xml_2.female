I got my summer reading there. There were a lot of other things that I wanted to buy but I didn't get anything. I am too cheap to buy things. I wish I weren't always so cheap. I really want to find this one book that Matt and I were talking about before. It seemed really good, but I can't remember the name of it. This was a long time ago though. Tonight Dave may be coming over to watch some movies and stuff. I really wish that Matt and I would go out again tonight, but I highly highly doubt he will call me again tonight. I'm sure he is majorly sick of me. I had so much fun last night with Elissa and him. I'm so happy that Elissa was there, because I don't think I wouldn't have been able to kiss him. I would have probably been too embaressed. Or else it would have been really nice if it would have turned into like a make out session, or else if he just like stayed longer or something. I really enjoyed leaning against him, and having my leg on his. I wonder what he thought of it. I just can't believe i did kiss him. I'm happy I did it though. Well I'm going to be leaving now. Peace out, dogs.
