In between the play, antoinette, caroline, katie and i all goofed off throwing food at eachother and listening to music. i killed a huge and scary bug with orange legs. it was sick. then i talked with some other "pops" (the popular people, they came over most likely because we had food) and they started looking through my CD case and saying how great weezer was and how they loved phantom planet. sure, i'm sure they really love phantom planet (sarcasim is the key to understanding my blog.) so anyway, all day i thought about how people i don't know very well care about me (i.e. mark, and mary's other friends) while people at home who do know me well are evil to me (i.e. margaret, smith) about things such as, me needing to call the orthodontist and having margaret and smith say (when i say i'm going to go) "it's ok, just push mute again" like i'm listening to their conversation. ha! like they ever talk about anything productive, i'm sure! mark, i do very much appriciate that you care about me, that's like a symbolic blanket being laid over me, knowing that someone cares. i really do need more hugs! but it's all good. my friends are awesome, and grades are good. mom and dad are safe in rome, and mary's discussion avec moi was very supportive because it showed me that i should be independent. thanks mar. so anyway, i'm hopefully a better person. unless this is a phase, but i don't think it is. better go, later, Jules
