It was actually a trippy sort of experience, not because I haven't been there for a while but because everything seems to be falling apart. Not the building but the way Eckstein used to be seems to be gone. When we graduated a whole bunch of older teachers and the principal of 14 years left with us. The new principal seems to have either changed things for the worst or lost control completely. It's very strange in there now, trash and graffiti is everywhere. One of the teachers we talked to today told us that the new principal is extremely strict and the entire atmosphere feels strained most days.   I was at Eckstein for a photography project, if nothing else its an awfully interesting looking building, with the right light it makes a pretty good picture. Especially the old choir room, the sun sets directly into it making a very lovely, shadowed scene. The current teacher in that room and I were trying to figure out the vintage of the sound equipment, evidently there hasn't been a choir class in there since the late 50's or earlier. Anyway, there is some pretty spinky stuff to photograph so I'm happy. :)  Helen showed up today looking dead... Her eyes were bright red, it was pretty freaky. I mean it was ALL red; eyeball and eyelid. I dunno what happened to her but, damn. I should've been the one with red eyes today. I could not get my contacts in this morning. I sat around poking myself in the eye for 20 minutes before the bloody things finally went in. Good lord.   My hair is so dry that it was actually making crunching noises earlier. I'm disappointed in it, I've been waiting months for it to grow out so I can dye it again and now this. What did I ever do to it? Besides dying eight different colours? The problem was the two times I dyed it black, the stuff will NOT come out and it takes forever to grow. So I've been sitting around for the last hour with super-conditioner in my hair. Not the funniest thing ever but my hair stylist claims it'll help. Suppose I should wash it soon though. Ah well, I'm off to do it now.
