I finally had it when my water bottle fell out so I kicked it and yelled at Shauna to pick it up. (Sorry about that by the way) Anyways waking up at 5 isn't so bad anymore now it's just trying to make it to class on time. I won't worry about that for now though it's almost the end of the week and I'm glad enough that it's here sort of... On other news I'm sick. What started as a simple sore throat turned into a nasty stuffy nose and me sniffing at every second. It's hard enough to remember everything I had to do. I have duties and I attend to finish them all. I feel like I'm giving a speech or something. Heh here's something funny my dog is walking on the computer. Here's what she typed "bbv b ncxghnjb b vv" Lovely isn't it. I'm going to do stuff I have to do instead of talking to a screen so who ever reads this. Go buy some of those really squishy pillows at Chandler Mall...
