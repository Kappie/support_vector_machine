Tune in in a couple of hours. Maybe I'll be pissed off again by then. Oasis is a good band. I'm not just now realizing this, I'm just now listening to the music. I knew they were good, I just didn't listen to them. If only I could find that CD.......  God I'm tired. I had a good dream about Jeff Corwin last night. Emily (Keegan) had connections so she made it so I could go with him. We were swimming in Lake Conneaut. It's like, all the playground equipment was still there, just submerged in water. And there were all these really cool fish. Man, he could swim fast. Made me feel slow, and I'm a pretty good swimmer. Then I broke his cameras and I thought he was going to get really mad at me... but he didn't... I dunno. Then we were going back to shore (the parking lot) when dad woke me up and told me I had to get up because the realitors were showing the house at 10. Damn them all for interrupting my good dream. Man those fish were cute. It wasn't nearly as weird as the dream with cassie and tracy though. Woodstock was there too... I'll get into that one later. For now, I think I'm just gonna go back to sleep...  Mmmm, sleep.  rockcandy1419 (10:43:29 PM): i want mark's dick? rockcandy1419 (10:44:37 PM): hehe...he would enjoy it...
