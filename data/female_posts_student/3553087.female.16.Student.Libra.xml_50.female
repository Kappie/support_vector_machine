'punk-o-rama", from walmart. its a two disc set. its alright but it has too many new songs and not enough of the old british punk shit that i like. the fuckin clash, bitch! heh. so..whats been up lately..hmm. i found out that peter's not the one who called me a stalker, it was matt stephens. hes really stinky. i wear my gas mask whenever i have to 'stalk' him. : ) what a complete douche. one day hes callin me a stalker and the next hes tellin me he still has feelings for me and stuff..RIGHT. i doubt that bitch can even feel love.  lee was over here today. we watched kill bill together. we were completly fucking broke so we couldnt get high. cj called but he was on his way to work so that was no help. but i had fun with lee, without getting high, and i think thats a good thing. i like him a lot. i take back that shit i said about breaking up with him. hes too nice for that. well next week, we will have had been together for a month. kinda feels like that to. i talked to brandon c. the other day and he said him and roxy have been together for thirteen months...thats a long fucking time. geez i really hope me and lee can last that long, and even longer. that would be so awesome. i've never had a really long relationship like that so that would be really cool. well, time to go find some trouble to get into. im outtie.
