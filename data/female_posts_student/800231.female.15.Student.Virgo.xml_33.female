It's always bloody math, I had A's and B's in ALL of my other classes. Of course I was pretty much expecting this, I haven't actually done anything in math all year, but still. Anyway, my mentorship teacher Mrs. C saw my loverly F in math and went insane again. You'd think it would be my parents that get made but nope, 'twas my mentorship teacher. Anyway, after several minutes of discussing how this would look on my record, Mrs. C decided to take matters into her own hands. She was going to go Mrs. B and try to get my grade changed. So there  are  pluses to making friends with the teachers! I expected her to email her or something, but as I was leaving school yesterday Lucia told me that Mrs. C had actually walked in during a class and interrupted Mrs. B. Then they stood around talking about me rather loudly in front of a class full of people that know me... There goes keeping my grades private. It may of actually made a difference though, I'll have to wait and see.  They've been having a school-funded "Rap Battle" for the last two days. Couldn't they find anything better to spend the budget on? We're in a district that can't even get the toilets fixed but setting up a very expensive three day show is perfectly acceptable? They've even found a few semi-famous people from around the city to preform. Of course, all of the school contestants are white guys with whiny voices... Great, eh? Then we had some guy who sounded just like cookie monster, when he was finished he was all: "All the gangstas in the house! Give it up!" *Crickets* "What? You guys musta not had breakfast or something..." Alice, Lucia, Breanna, Helen and I were laughing our asses off in the hallway. The guy left looking all confused and hurt.  I actually fell asleep when I got home today. I don't think I've ever done that before, slept from 3 o'clock to 5. So I felt like a total dipshit, but I feel rested.
