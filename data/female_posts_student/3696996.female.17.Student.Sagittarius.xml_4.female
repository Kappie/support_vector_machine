It's so good, I started reading it yesterday and I'm almost half way through, it's wicked good.  another good recommendation is the princess and the goblin, I read it last year...if you read that, though your second summer book has to be the princess and curdie.  They are really better than they sound.  So, I'm trying to figure out what is going no today so I better get going.
