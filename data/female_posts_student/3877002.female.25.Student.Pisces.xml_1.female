Hilary Duff for making a movie so bad that Rolling Stone called it "upchucky"    The scheduling department at "On Air with Ryan Seacrest" for booking Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, and Warren G. on the same day as Richard Simmons   The meter maid for giving me the standard $15 parking ticket rather than the $55 citation that I usually get   The Director of Catering at the Renaissance Hotel for being just late enough for our 1:00 lunch appointment that I spotted Jeff Goldblum in the lobby   The Starbucks barista in Cleveland who gave me a freeextra shot in my Iced Grande Skim No Whip White Chocolate Mocha   Barnes and Noble for always having an empty seat by the window   Bravo for showing a " urlLink Blow Out " marathon every Sunday afternoon   All my fabulous friends who are all just as screwed up as I am but consistently take time out of their busy schedules to validate and consoleme
