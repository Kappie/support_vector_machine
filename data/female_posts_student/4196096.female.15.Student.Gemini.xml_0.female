We got free food though so it wasn't all bad!  Tonight me Kelsey and Brianne went to Casey's with Nick...and Shahrom and Landon were there as well! That was pretty fun I guess.We sat there bored for awhile then Kelsey got a little tipsy and she was funny, then poor Landon got sick, but I can see why...I mean that kid mixes some weird shit!! Hello vodka and beer in the same container? In the words of Brianne "WHO DOES THAT!"Yeah, it was sad! Then we got bored so we walked on over to Wallace Marine park.....Where we played on the swings!!! Now that is where the fun began...Casey pushed Bree and Nick pushed me. It was fun. It would have been more fun if Kels and Shahrom would have joined, but NO they were busy!!!Then we decided it was getting late and we should proabably head home...so Nick took me Kels and Bree home, and Casey joined. AND the cones on commericial right before you can turn onto Kuebler, yeah Nick almost hit them straight on...you shouldn't let stoned guys drive.Then Brianne saved us.......THANK GOD!!!! My heart effing stopped I swear. Anyway, we got Kelsey home safely.After that we had to decide which way we wanted to go home...the boring way or over orgasm hill, well obviously we picked orgasm hill! Although we had to Pry Brianned fingers of the steering wheel becasue she was too scared!!!! Then Nick kept going straight when the idiot should have turned, and once again Bree saved us. Nick was driving bad because he was busy freaken tickeling Brianne. And on the way up the hill casey wouldn't fucking stop tickeling us, while he was trying to convince me there was ghost's on the side of the road! Haha with Axes, and they wanted to kill me so I covered my eyes!  Overall the day was probably about a 7, it wasn't great but it wasn't bad at all, the end of the night was prbably the most fun!  Okay well I am really tired so I am going to stop writing now, goodnight everyone...sleep tight!
