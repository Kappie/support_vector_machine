Oh, we saw Alex and Audra at Hi-School Pharmacy. There was a tennis thing tonight, but Amanda didn't want to go, and Kaila did, so she had to drop her off. Earlier, Alex called for Amanda and wanted Amanda to come, but she was set on not going. So we try to drop off Kaila, without being noticed, but I don't think it worked. Oh well, it was funny. Also, when Amanda was trying to take me home, she decided to take the long way...a nice 20 min detour. It was so funny. Basically, today was a fun day.
