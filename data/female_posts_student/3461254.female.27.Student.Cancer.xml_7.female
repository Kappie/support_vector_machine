Then I came to Ann Arbor and had fun with my friends (including Amber, who also needs to update her blog :) All in all, it's been a nice trip, and I hope it doesn't get too stressful when I try to contact the "fake family" and let them know I'm on to them...  That is, trying to figure out how to tactfully let them know I'm not really related to them.  Also wondering if I should try to make progress on the "real family" front.  Always a mess...  But for now, relax! Get ready for the trip back to Detroit!
