I went to dylans house, which is always fun :) we slept so much... we literally woke up, went back to sleep, and woke up at like 4. but thats okay.... as boring as it sounds i had fun sleeping next to him. I love him.  then i hung out with melissa! :) shes probably like, my best friend. she came over and we had all this ambition to go work out and we just sat around in the sun and ate and did NOTHING. and then we went over to jessies and hung out and then we were going to go to a party but it was "cancelled" or something stupid like that... so we went to king soopers to buy dxm and we saw stevo... so we got distracted and went to fascinations to buy nitris and did a bunch of that... it was so cool. First your lips go numb, then your toes... then your fingers, then your wrists, then your shoulders, then your arms and the back of your legs, then your chest and then you lay back and sort of trip for a while. Dont think ill do that ever again, but it was still fun. I really want to to dxm again. Or try acid.  dylan wrote this huge long cheesy entry in his blog about me, but i read it and i couldnt stop smiling. I love that kid. if you want to read his blog, the address is www.wyrmwood.blogspot.com  My spring break was so short-lived. it just flew by. It seems like it has just been a normal weekend. And tomorrow i have to go back to school. ::pout:: But at least tomorrows wednesday, so i only have a 3-day week. And then my freedom resumes at 3:00 on friday afternoon.  My stomach hurts... it gets worse and worse. I hope nothings wrong with me.... i'm tired, though. Im going to be a dork and go to bed all early. nightnight.  ~abby~
