Plus, it's my problems and I'm sure people are sick and tired of listening to it or trying to understand. I understand people have their own stuff to deal with and I'd rather help them out. First period I found out some stuff that made me more confused than I already am, if that is even possible. It feels like we've both been hurt, although I know it was my fault. But then again, it feels like there's been so much misunderstanding and as much as I want to clear everything up, I said that I would stop putting drama in their life. It's my fault and missing them is my punishment. But one last time, of talking things out, I would do anything to get that but that chance left me cuz I'm dumb but I don't know, I guess I'm naive but I'd like to hope that it's because I had so much faith and love in our friendship be4 I screwed it up that I"m not willing to let go of every single memory or every single hope that we'd talk again, my heart just can't do it. I'm trying so hard to change so this can never happen again but no matter what, even if I do succeed in changing into a better person, the prize of having the past back probably won't be what I'll get..argh..and then there's him...I know he wanted a break but it seems like this break is pushing us further apart and the longer the dayas go, the more scared I am to talk to him. For every human being, it's hard to say sorry and admit to your flaws but it's also harder to consider that maybe even when you do say I'm sorry, it's not good enough..I think I just need 2 give him breathing time, I don't want him more mad at me but I know for a fact I do not want to lose him so hopefully, I can say sorry in due time [just scared] but I know it's worth it cuz I'm exhausted from crying and I'm exhausted of being the girl that doesn't fix the wrong she's done. It's not worth losing my friendship with him just because of my stupidity and all my flaws. I'd rather just fix myself and lose the worst part of me...The rest of school was long and dragging after 1st pd..Pauly signed the yearbook and so did Kev, oh man, for Kev's yearbook I did 2 pgs and I had more 2 say but I ran out of space cuz weird ppl wrote like in humongous font on his hehe it's okay. Afterschool always breaks my heart. This is the one emotion I"m most prone to showing but I know I can't. I want him to be happy and everytime I see him from the corner of my eyes, he's smiling or laughing. I mean ya it hurts to know that smile or laugh isn't because of me anymore but it's because he's without me or it's because some other girl gave it to him. But his happiness is all I want, no matter how much it hurts..I just wish we'd talk..but I can't force him to talk to me if his heart doesn't want to, I have to force myself to be content with the memories and the smell from that sweater I smell every night..I just hope the next girl can show how much he is appreciated the way I didn't show it but most of all, I hope she can love him how much I do now...Okay this is enough rambling, all I do these days is ramble...it's pathetic...I'm sleeping so much now a days too it's sad cuz it's how I can stop my mind from thinking even tho sleeping doesn't cause the heart to stop feeling, sometimes I wish it would though..omygod plus I'm getting so fat now from actually eating it's so digusting to see, I definitely need to put that gym membership into work or better off, just run at pl cuz I need to get rid of this fat, it's hard enough to look in the mirror, I don't need to see fat either, sickly. Anyways, after roaming the halls for a while I went to the bus concourse to meet up w/brendan and mike novakowski (or however u spell it lol) and me and mike walked to kev's. We had a good talk going there, I really never took the time to get to know Mike so it was nice. He told me about some of his problems so I hope that gets better and I hope he just does what will make him happy in the long run, don't live life with regrets. At kev's, we were just all nerds and studied for a while then me and kev looked at yearbooks then joined mike and mikey to play baseball and then I went home..now I have to try and focus to study for chemistry and english..it's so hard 2 focus or even care...oh man it's getting hard 2 breathe again like I was walking up the stairs to geometry class and I get in the class and I stopped because I had to catch my breath I could not breathe for the life of me and diandra felt my heartbeat and it was going like 100 per second. My back's acting up again but I just want to ignore it, it's the least of my problems...
