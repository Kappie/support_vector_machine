I've always told myself that I would find someone and fall in love w/ them just like in the movies, by the time I was sixteen.  Well, I did fall for someone two years ago...the thing is...he never knew it.  His name shall be anonymous throughout this whole entry.  Anyway, we had become good friends and we were constantly bickering and being mean to one another.  I didn't really realize that I had fallen for him until last Christmas.  We had become even closer and I even started thinking maybe he felt the same way.  My friends started telling me that I should make the first move, but if you know me, you would know that I'm really shy.  I've never once told a guy how I truly felt about him.  Then I started thinking that what if we really did feel the same way about each other and I just didn't know, and I would find out on down the road that if I had of said something then we would have probably been together.  I wasn't going to lose that chance.  So, I did it.  I wrote him a letter telling him exactly how I felt and all I asked in return was for him to just think about it and give me an answer.  It could be either way.  All he had to do was just say "yes" or "no".  That's not that hard right?  Well, I sent him that letter in the middle of May and it is now July 10.  At first I didn't really worry about it b/c I told him in the letter to take all the time he needed and I meant it.  Well, I get a call from my friend telling me that she saw him at Applebee's last night w/ a girl, holding hands.  I know you're prolly thinking, "Why does that surprise you?  All guys are like that!" but if you really knew him the way I *thought* I did, then you would be surprised too.  He's completely different from other guys.  He's a big christian, he likes you for who you are, and he has very valuable morals.  And he's the only guy that could ever really make me smile and laugh.  So, hearing all of this from my friend really hurt.  I sent him an email letting him know how hurt and pissed off I am about it.  So, I guess I'll just have to wait and see what his response is.  But, right now all I can think is...Love really bites!
