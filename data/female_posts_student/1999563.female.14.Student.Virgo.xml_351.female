Tonight we were supposed to go to Target but hannah foolishly didn't do anyof her homework today or yesterday at CYT and instead played cards. She had not very much homework and she just put it off which caused me to suffer greatly. It makes me mad, I worked hard all these two days off and I got everything all done then she goofs off and causes me to suffer. Now they are going tomorrow while I am at piano. :(  Then I was bored so I cleaned out the fridge and after I finished I was putting the nasty old food in the trash and the whole can fell over spilling the contents all over the floor. I then had to clean this nasty noodle junk from the floor.   Thennn...I was making a yummy smoothie and my mom made me give half of it to my "hard working sister"  But, I did win a lip gloss from Lucky Magazine, which was cool.  The internet has been so good to me.   Liek the one time where I won 100  bottles of gatorade. That was funny.  After like two bottles I was like, "this is the most disgusting stuff in the whole world."  Today I finally ordered my sutff off of Delias which is *cool* I can't wait till it arrives.  Later gators,  Laura
