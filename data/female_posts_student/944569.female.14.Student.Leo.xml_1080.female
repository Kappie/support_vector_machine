I decided to launch a line of "doll fashion wear" with bits of clothing and such that i find on the internet.  Wish me luck. Oh, i'm also working on a new book.  i feel that this one will win for sure.  I have decided to title it as "The Glass Rose". It will be a really sad book of philosophy and life.  I can see it already...
