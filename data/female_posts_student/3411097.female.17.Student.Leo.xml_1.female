HaiZz.. life sucks.. Sometimes i really dunno who to talk to.. Who exactly will understand my feelings.. Friends? Boyfriend? Family members? But at this very moment when i need someone to be there.. i find no one.. Maybe my circle of frens are jus too small.. Suddenly i really feel pity for myself.. For that.. i cant even find someone to pour my problems to...Haha.. Today then i noe e feelings that pple said.. Words can actually hurt someone deeply... Yah.. a few careless words actually can pierce someone heart so deep..esp when e person mean so much to you.. What make it worst is you had to act as if u are very strong when u are feeling v v sad.. Haha.. i am so "fortunate" today to actually receive this feeling from 2 diff person.. Haha.. But its good in a way that i get to experience diff kind of feelings and learn things from it.. Maybe.. maybe... i should not had fall so deep.. so deep..Well.. I guess that's life.. Now i am starting to believe in retribution.. Haha..
