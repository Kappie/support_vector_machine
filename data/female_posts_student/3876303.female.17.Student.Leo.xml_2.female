My mother is getting married and moving to Belize. I am moving to Wyoming to live with my grandparents while they put me through college early. I knopw my mom loves me, but why must she be such a royal b****? Why must she hate me for having friends online? I can't believe how horrible she can make me feel. Sometimes, I just wish I could be on my own, ya know? Sure, the responsibilities are huge, but you're allowed to be your own person.
