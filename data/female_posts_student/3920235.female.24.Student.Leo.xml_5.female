However, I'm getting quite bored with it because there isn't much you can really do with is.  I decided to explore my options as far as weblogs are concerned, and as you can see, I ended up here.  I liked using LJ, but after a while I started getting bored with it because really, there's only so much you can do with a free account.  Hopefully this will better suit my needs.  What I'm struggling with right now is whether or not I want to be brutally honest with this thing.  Yes, I am a good, honest person but do I really want to post  everything  that I'm thinking or do I want to conveniently leave out specific details about my personal life, like I have with LJ.  It would be a different tactic to try with this weblog, and I'm sure it'd make me seem that much more interesting to those who happen to stumble across this page.  I'll have to think about it some more.  I should go ahead and end this now because I read somewhere on Blogger that they're going to be doing some maintencance this evening and I don't want this entire post to be lost because I didn't publish it in time.  Adios, amigos.
