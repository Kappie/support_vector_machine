It was weird. ..I'm not going to try to describe it here; I'm just going to say that it took place at a very, very, very odd bowling ball factory.... But it started out as some cheap end of a very small town in the middle of nowhere that I was seeking refuge in from.. someone.. I can't remember, and I don't think I was too sure in the dream either. It had the basically same plot as before, but this time I died very differently... well, I didn't actually die, but I was a cliffhanger, so I think it is best to assume that I did...  I love my dreams!
