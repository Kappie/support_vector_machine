Played Vice City, and got bored actually completing missions, so I ended up seeing how many cops I could kill. And now I'm doing absolutely nothing.  Well. I just forgot I was posting something in here, and it's been like 20 minutes since I started this.  So I completely lost my train of thought.  Take it easy, crazies.
