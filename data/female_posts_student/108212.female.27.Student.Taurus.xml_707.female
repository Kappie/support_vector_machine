Who wouldnt have a great time?  A ten course Chinese dinner;  My brother-in-law as the DJ; All of Dot's friends from UB* and of course Open Bar!  The open bar made the headlines.  Our friend Dave (Nappy) went to the dancefloor with a drink in hand and spilled half of it on Dot's dress.  Thank goodness for club soda and a blow dryer.  Em changed dresses 4 times last night from wedding gown to traditional chinese to 2 night gowns.  Man, this is where Cher got the idea for her concerts.  No drinks on Ems clothes though.  After Dot's incident, Billy (brother-in-law) announced through the PA that there will be no more drinking on the dancefloor.  The tea ceremony was  a tear jerker.  Emily had tears in her eyes when she received the traditional red envelope from her mother.  Was it the amount?  Only Em and Werner know.  Going off for now, The Sopranos are showing again on HBO2.    More to come NET
