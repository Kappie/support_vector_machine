I see...  a world full of hate  a world full of death  Destruction.  Where is the good?  Where is love?  I need love...  In world full of depression...  Suppression  Cruelity  Disdain  Animosity  Malevolence  Resentment  I know it's there somewhere....  Is it out of my grasp?  Surrounded.  Like the walls of a great city.  I cannot escape it.  The hate is everywhere.  I know love is also everywhere.  Then why must I focus on the disdain?  Why must our world only see the problems rather than the solutions?  What about the 9 year old who raised 400,000 dollars to fight cancer?  No one hears about Alex.  Now she has parted from our world...  Just a word in a novel.  A stroke on a canvas.  What about the man who gave a dollar to a homeless lady?  No one will hear his story.  Why can't the news focus on the amazing love that is everywhere in this world?  Love is everywhere.  We just have to look past the sorrow.  See the mother and her child living on the street?  The mother starves so her child can have a little food.  Why is not this rewarded?  I guess I will find out when my page in the novel is completed.
