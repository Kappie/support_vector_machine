Tom and I went on up to London and he has already said what we did. The guns you can move were great fun. My arms are all muscly now, lol. Well we kept pointing them at on coming boats and then following them as they went by which was great fun. It was great being a kiddie again. Hehe. The musems were interesting, well, what we saw. I think they will have to be made into proper day outs then we can actually do all the exhibits. Oh yea - Bow, stern, starboard and port. WAHEY! It wasn't that bad wandering around trying to find the photo shop. It was worth it. Its cute. hehe. And the lady was really nice. I liked her. Yay. So yesterday I did sod all. Today I went shopping in Bromly with my sister. Got some cheap clothes in the sales. Wahey! I have alos just figured out how to make my own CD!!!!! So far I have made a 'Rock On!! A Nikko Production.' album. Over the coming weeks I will make a party album and 'Nikko's Greatest Love Songs'. If you want copies you will have to give me a CD and I will make one. Hehe.  Um, what else. Max BLOG.  Park on Sunday should be good. Nic and Jen will be joining us for once. Wahey. One last note, you know you got a willing slave you just like to play the thought that you might misbehave but since I'm only dead to you I'm saying stay away. Get it?
