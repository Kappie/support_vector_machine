Here are the 12 picks by Entertainment Weekly readers:  1. "Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die." --Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) in "The Princess Bride"  2. "Inconceivable!" "You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means." --Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) in "The Princess Bride"  3. "Have fun storming the castle." --Miracle Max (Bill Crystal) in "The Princess Bride"  4. "As you wish." --Westley (Cary Elwes) in "The Princess Bride"  5. "I'll have what she's having." --Female diner (Estelle Reiner) in "When Harry Met Sally"  6. "You had me at hello." --Dorothy Boyd (Reneé Zellweger) in "Jerry Maguire"  7. "Fasten your seat belts--It's going to be a bumpy night." --Margo Channing (Bette Davis) in "All About Eve"  8. "You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together...and blow." --Marie Browning (Lauren Bacall) in "To Have and Have Not"  9. "If I'd been a ranch, they would've named me Bar Nothin'." --Gilda (Rita Hayworth) in "Gilda"  10.

And don't come back for five to seven days!" --Vada Sultenfuss (Anna Chlumsky) in "My Girl"  Entertainment Weekly editors didn't want the readers to have all the fun. So they picked 50 more great movie quotes from the last half century. Here are the top five:  1. "I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender.

She's my sister and my daughter." --Evelyn Cross Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) in "Chinatown"
