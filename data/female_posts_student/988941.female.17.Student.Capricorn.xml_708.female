Thank you for remembering :) I'm not looking forward to Thursday either, I don't think our group is meeting up but I am sure we will all merge together when we are at the school. I haven't heard of any dinners or parties, or I haven't been invited. Guess I brought that on myself by not turning up to Daz's bbq. Oh my. How could I. I'm sorry but I am rather annoyed. People are a bit mad at me for not going. Fair enough. But how come its me they are mad at? How come when other people do the same thing its fine!? No getting annoyed at that person or whatever, just me. Grrr. I just can'tget it right can I? Perhaps I should disappear off the face of the earth and then perhaps people may miss me. Or maybe they will start to spread blame out rather than focus it on one person.  I understand that perhaps I have annoyed folk by talking about James, Jon, Leon and Ema alot but that is because  1) they are new and the novelty hasn't worn off yet 2) they don't place blame on me Its not everyone, only a few. But those few make me go all urgh and then I guess it can affect the ones who I love. If that makes sense. Yes I am in a badish mood. Why? Because my gorgeous new fabulas skate shoes decided that today when I walked up to Warlingham they were going to rip half the skin off my ankle which is not pleasant. I have also been shouted at 6 times today for the smallest things. So excuse me for having a moan.
