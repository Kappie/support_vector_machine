This does little to help. As now she just stands in front  of it, looking at herself, asking him how she looks.   One day, fresh out of the shower, she is yet again in front of the  mirror. Now complaining that her breasts are too small!  Uncharacteristically, the husband said. "If you want your breasts to  grow, then every day take a piece of toilet paper and rub it between  your breast for a few seconds."   Willing to try anything, the wife fetches a piece of toilet paper,  stands in front of the mirror, rubbing it between her breasts.   "How long will this take?" she asks.   "They'll grow larger over a period of years," he replies.   The wife stops," Why do you think rubbing this piece of toilet paper  between my breast everyday will make my breasts grow over the years?"  she asks.   The husband shrugs." WHY NOT, IT WORKED FOR YOUR ASS, DIDN'T IT!"    ------------------------------------------------------------------- okay nvm on wif todae. woah. todae is one day which im back  urlLink home  early (dat means before 5 reach  urlLink home , assuming i spend abt 8 hours outside everyday) in the morning went to amk mrt there and reached there abt say 6.50? damn tiring, seemed as though my head weighed a ton. lucky my dad fetch. lucky me. lolz had to brief michelle and yong chun larh for their bm and dm understudy.. but i was supposed to meet them at say 7.20? haha. ended up that i din bring my headphones out then did some paperwork for band till then. met terry and chuan jian and nice them came to talk to me lor. haha. they were supposed to meet their frenrs at seven but when they reached at say 7.10? nobody lor. haha. and they were supposed to hve breakfast. lolz. wait i thot michelle lost the outing minutes lor. turned out as she typed it out and lost the original copy. hai wo rewrite everything according to my  urlLink memory . dotz. after briefing them, went up to the plaform. as usual, i was the earliest. saw pauline on the way though. lolz. next came vincent then after a while, matthew appeared out of thinair(idinseehim) b4 peizhi,lihuan joined us. lolz. and the latest was the organiser lor:xiwen. haha. saw some realli funny sights. and disgusting ones. saw ck. lolz. nvm.. haha.i was like omg ck.. then eeks. haha. nvm. then went to somerset to hve my seminar.. orh it was boring. seriously. i culdnt keep myself awake. oh yah. did i mention that anthony wanted to kill me. coz i told him to meet in sch or sth to brief his QMs, but i din say im goin. so i din go and he... haix. he waited for me i guess. wahhaa. he came in pe attire larh and attracted quite a lot of laughter too larh. nvm larh. ya gort ya dear daryl to sit wif u ma.. lolz. percussion.zzz.  nvm. the lecture was boring lor xcept for the break. haha. i enjoyed the  urlLink food  lor. weilong, me and vincent were like eating second and third helpings. haha. but we din finish all the fd on the table larh. we're nort pigs. tokin abt pigs: rmbed someone who suaned me that i can nv be a pig. i thot she was being nice or wat before she said that i dun even deserve to be a pig. juz becoz i sleep a lot.. she oso whatx. but nvm. it was onli suaning... lol  after that decided to go off wif my class. dun say i always nv go wif u all larh.. haha. lucky jiesin nort there.
