It is distressing to see how the government is handling the whole issue about national security. I do understand the fact that people are tensed about the current situation in the U.S. But people are sacrificing their fundamental rights to national security. Is this the only way to find the terrorists?  The “Patriot Act” is violating everything about America (I hope I won’t get killed for saying it). When I hear the word “America”, I picture freedom. But today it has come to a level where Americans can’t be Americans anymore. Rights of expression, privacy and religion have been deprived from the people. Is this what the people in America voted for? Well it is true that the “terrorism” was not expected until the Towers and the Pentagon was attacked. But I “hear” that the government knew about this brutal act even before it occurred. Why didn’t the government do something about it then? Why did the terrorist even attack in the first place? I have so many questions wandering around in my mind. I hope someone can give me an unbiased answer someday…
