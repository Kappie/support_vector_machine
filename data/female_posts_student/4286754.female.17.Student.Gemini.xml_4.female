But I'm excited because there is a party planned for Wednesday, invite-only, and I just so happen to have an invite! Woo!  I feel sort of bad tho, cause I am cancelling out of another party that I have been invited to on the same night. That party won't be as much fun tho, only a few people are coming and we're going to some lake that I've never been to before. One of the guys that would be at the lake party (his name is Justin) really likes me and wants to take me out...but I have cleverly made up lies to get out of that. One of those such lies is that I am going out with Jared...which is quite the whopper considering that #1. Jared is one of my  best friends , not my  boyfriend  and #2. Jared is gay. So obviously, I am not romantically involved with Jared, but since Justin doesn't live here and he only knows me, he has no idea. I do feel bad about lying, but I figure that its better on him to think that he can't have me cause I'm with someone else, than to not get me cause I'm not interested. I'm not  that  mean, am I? >.  Anyways...I hope I get to see Scot tonight. I'd post a picture of him but I'm not at home.  BYE! :D
