And hopefully this is the first post of many...even though I would imagine that no one is going to read this for a while. Although, this site had already given me a good spot of trouble today. I hope it is just an off-day because it is the 25th. What a day to start my new journal on :-/    Go figure.   Well, award ceremony tomorrow...meaning I get to find out what I got exactly...while simultaneously missing my meeting. Blast! I sent the e-mail to Dave so it should be all good. Wow. Now that I am using this I have to remember that basically none of my former readers are reading this so everything that I am saying is basically going to be irrelevant. Er, I suppose that I shall need to use my best discretion in choosing who to tell about this journal.   ::taps keyboard::  Yeeeah, k...well, I suppose that I am going to run and assume that this post will publish now. Hopefully I will get  someone  to read it by the end of the night. Talk to y'all later...er...maybe not...   -J9
