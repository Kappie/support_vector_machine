I sat on the four sided sea saw or something and my ass hurts now. but kids were like harrassing me and they didn't listen and they were saying stuff they shouldnt have been and busting me about this kid. Nina came to visit me which was cool .. i wish she was working again. Matt's going on vacation next week so i might be stuck walking home =\ ooo and then my brother john threw something at a little girl and she cried for like 10 minutes and i was pissed at him and then i was arguing with my dad about it. in the end john is not going tomorrow but keira might be which is probally worse. ugg  I want to go for a run but it's too hot and i just cant run in this weather. Oh and i was going to have people over tonight but I dont think that's gonna work out either cause my mom's away and i cant deal with my father. And i need to visit my greatgrandma but my dad probally wont want to bring me but i havent seen her in a while =(  But i just read Mandie's journal and it motivated me to do sit-ups so i'm gonna go do that.. write more later   Pink Floyd- Wish You Were Here   "so you think you can tell heaven from hell, blue skys from pain?" *Kyle was playing that for me when i was talking to him on the phone yesterday so that made me happy and now i'm in a better mood =)  Well now it's 8:27 and i showered after my 45 minute/hopefully 4 mile run. My dad is bonding with steve over music like Pink Floyd ..who's CD i listened to when i was running and other real music like that. So that made me happy. I beleive people are going to carissa's after the Hannan bball game but i might just chill here. That's it for today xoxo -kacie
