One person told me I was nieve when it came 2 boys, because I don't know when they check me out or hit on me . I think if u think that people are checking u out or hitting on u that u are kinda vain and stuck on yourself. I really don't care if any guy looks at me as long as I marry Devan. Andrew got the same car as Devan that is not cool. All I could think of last night was Devan it was weird I havnt felt like that in a while , oh well. I really dont want 2 start school cause I know it is going 2 be a walking Hell cause their is no one that I can really trust there. And I could say some other things but I will write those in my real journal. maybe
