(i think this is how i managed to stumble upon  urlLink hell ,  who introduced me to a lot of weird web art.. which is sadly not showing up in the archive or on the current site.)   well, today we're going to take a walk down memory lane, with the wonderful assistance of my beloved  urlLink archive.org .  do you remember orbitz, the sci fi drink of potential?  the drink that was beyond a drink because it had globs of gelatin  defying gravity ?  the only time i drank it (c'mon i was supporting  the future , and i love the future) was at a party, were it was discovered that it made for a shitty mixer. (the globs sink to the bottom when the density is changed, and you find yourself at the bottom of a glass being attacked by globs of jelly.)   well, at the time i didn't bother to rush out and see if the drink had a website of the future... and the drink was mostly forgotten.  well.  orbitz had a website.  urlLink the oldest archived version (from 1996), is only amusing because it requires netscape 2.0... unfortunately, one can't explore further into the depths because it wasn't archived.  *sigh*  a year later, in 1997,  urlLink orbitz's site  gets exciting.  go explore for a good laugh.      hi, welcome back.  now, i hate to break it to you but orbitz the drink is no more thus there hasn't been a need for a website about a drink that no longer exists.  but in one of those silly dotcom moves, the website itself became something else.  a travel website i use, whose name i've questioned yet never connected back to the balls of gelatin suspended in a beverage. somehow i find it strange to watch  urlLink the birth of orbitz the travel site .....
