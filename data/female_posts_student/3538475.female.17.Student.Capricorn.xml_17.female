I went into town today, but the bus driver gave me a child ticket and said take it and we'll not argue about it, I was impressed!! It's not often that a bus driver is so nice to their passengers.  I see we have a rebel in the ranks!  It inspired me because I thought, if he got caught doing something like that he could get serious punishment yet he still did it...doesn't take much to do a good deed.  So, until I'm back at school my entries will be as boring as an afternoon in a nursing home.
