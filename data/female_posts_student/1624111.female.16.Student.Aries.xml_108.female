Love does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the right. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things." 1 Corinthians 13:4-7  Auto response from SweetMnM111: "Love never fails." 1 Corinthians 13:8  she often has that away message but i felt like...complimenting it...I'm so cool. :-)  haha, i love this movie!!
