Good music, at Maimes, (no, he's not here if that's what you're wondering :P) and I just had a Vvector Bar.  Woot.  Ewwy, I dislike Fefe Dobsone very much, she bothers me.   Ozzy Aerosmith... I have no idea why that name is in my head.  I can't remember who told me that.  I think it's someones nickname that I was told about.... Who's is it though... Tell me if you have any idea what I am talking about... Honestly, I can't remember!  I'm a Timmy Hoe!  Yea, my Fajah (aka my Dad) is bringing me to Tim Hortons and I'm gunna get chicken stew in a bread bowl and some other yummy stuff like a donut and coffee... (sorry, i was talking really fast there in my head... got a little to excited there...) (I like Tim Hortons).  Ok, I'm off the food train... I think me and Amy are gunna see a movie tonight... I wanna see The Butterfly Effect, (I thought it looked good, but then Shane made it sound really good, sooo, unfortunatly we have to wait until next Friday... :( )  I dunno what we'll see tonight though... we'll just have to see.  I'll go check what's out now.
