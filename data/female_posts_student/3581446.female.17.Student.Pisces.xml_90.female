The endings '-r', '-m' and '-t' are used to construct different types of concepts. '-m' indicates 'selfness', or proximity to the observer. All of what we would call 'nouns' in the language (though there is not a strict division between nouns and adjectives; they're all considered predicates to the all-important koppa verb) are indicated by the endings '-m', '-r', or '-rsi', which mark noun or adjective objects which are either 'self', (could indicate actual self, or possession) 'other', (things relevant to the second person) and 'distant other', an other more distant than 'you' and can generally be considered equivilent to he/she/it/they.  Now the '-t' ending just turns something into a participle, which are the Koppa equivilent of verbs. Verbs aren't constructed by putting the pronoun and participle by one another:    dala  m   felu  t   "I hoping"; rather they use the koppa verb to indicate the relation:   dala  m   koppa   felu  t   Now, word order doesn't matter, so that could be 'koppa dalam felut', 'dalam felut koppa', or whatever you'd like.   So 'dalat' is being. Also, what we would indicate with prepositions Koppa indicates with affixes. So instead of 'ke dalam', 'with me', Koppa says 'dalamke' or 'mewith'.   'beha' moves the relation indicated by the koppa into the future. So if the word being koppa'd is a participle, it moves the participle relationship into future time; 'dalam koppa felut' is "I am hoping", but 'dalam beha koppa felut' is "I will hope", or "I will be hoping".   Finally, the particle ka (as in Japanese) turns the sentence into a question and nulla negates the koppa. Therefore,   "nulla beha koppa dalar dalat dalamke ka" is  "Won't you be being with me?"  Make anymore sense? :)  -Ian
