Whether you know it or not, you are a much stronger written communicator than many, able to get your ideas across better than others.  It's also likely that you are methodical and efficient at many things that you do. You could also be good at math, particularly algebra, which is based on very strict rules that make sense to your logical mind.   You've got a healthy love of life and a killer instinct. Chances are you hate rules, and don't plan on getting old. You're flexible and friendly on top of being innovative and smart. In short, people respect you.  You're extroverted and love being in the spotlight. Your mantra is "work hard, play hard" — you like to live life to the limit.  Your intelligence seems to be the trait that you most value in yourself of the five main traits that affect confidence. You also seem to appreciate this characteristic in others.
