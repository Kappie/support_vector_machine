Everything he does is great.  This is why I love Kill Bill.  Not that I'm saying any of his other movies suck.  (Kill Bill knocked Pulp Fiction out of my no. 1 spot.)  It is my personal belief that everyone should see the two Kill Bill movies, to make them complete.    So, some treaties for those of you who have seen it-quizzes:  urlLink For the ladies...   urlLink For the know-it-alls...   urlLink Anyone who has seen the second movie...   Yeah, I know.  I should have better things going on with my time (school work, weight loss, ending world hunger...) but I don't.  There are very few things I'm this passionate about.  Sad that one of them is this movie.  Hey, Karen, thanks...I love you :)
