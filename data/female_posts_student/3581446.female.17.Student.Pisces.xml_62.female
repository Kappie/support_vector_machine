Felt the incredible crush of existential angst, while detesting in the strongest of terms my seemingly inevitable fate of being both aphilosopher and a misologist... Also, feeling cynical and misanthropic, in a hypocritical and self-abnegating sort of way. The demons of sleep caught up with me and extracted their fee, deprivingme of even more hours of the day...   hat of course being on top of the hours I spent talking to Loupe... Or Loupette. I tell you, when you can talk to someone for nearly eight hours straight with hardly a single lull in the conversation, you're reaching dangerous levels of conversational compatabillity.   Which reminds me- I and she have agreed that I am, most likely, some sort of clone of her with slight modifacations. To what end and by whom, we're not yet certain, but the evidence is fairly compelling.  The weather changed, so my monitor and modem have begun acting bitchy again, which means conversely that there shall be no L-box logging unto the net. Oh well.  I'm pretty sure there's nothing I can do about the philosopher/misologist status. I pretty much fail every time I try to dismantle my philosophical instincts, and like any experienced philosopher, I absolutely detest reason and wish I could live like regular people do, more or less by instinct alone. People usually don't go very wrong with that strategy.   Anyone considering getting into philosophy: don't. It will kill you sooner or later. As the refrains of a Chinese opium addict went, "My words are like the loud laugh of someone who is presently drowning".   As for the misanthropy and self-abnegation, I just need to lighten up. Actually, I need to do that about a lot of things, but I find it difficult. So there.  To anyone who was depressed or otherwise bummed by this post... Er, sorry. Don't worry about me. Things aren't so bad. It's just darkest before dawn, anyway. Tout va aller bien. All will be well. Life goes to the fighters, especially those who keep going when they're on the ropes. Those who stake little win less, those who press their bets win every time.   Is this true? I don't know. It doesn't matter. It's what I need to believe right now. Something that will work by your belief in it is not qualitatively inferior to something that will work whether you believe it or not. Function is truth.  -Theo
