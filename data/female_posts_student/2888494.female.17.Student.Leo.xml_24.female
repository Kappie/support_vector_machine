Max and Dan and I went on a wild rampage to kiss everybody on the cheek, seeing as it was our last day. I had a spiffy time.   I'm going to miss the play. Honestly- I am. It was ever so fun, I loved it. I'm going to have a cast party (get this) at my house either this week or next. Dave is throwing a hot tub party soon. I think I'm going to stay in touch with most of them, I'm excited. I love these people so much. Huzzah.  Yes- well, there is a chance I'm going to the temple tomorrow morning at 5:00, so I think I'll leave you and sleep after taking off the extreme amount of makeup that is currently covering my face.    Bubye, all.
