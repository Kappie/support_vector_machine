I've tried online journaling before but it never really worked well.  Dunno why.  I'll give  this blog thing a go and see if it works any better.  I created this blog because I thought it might be fun to outline some of my experiences.  You see, I'm going to be 39 soon and I'm a college student.  I'm working towards an undergrad degree in Biology.  What fun it is!  I'm single, I have a dog and I have a few off the wall hobbies.  This could get interesting.  So here I am on the second day of the first semester of my "junior" year.  I put junior in quotes because, well, I'm not sure how they figure that.  I'm in an odd spot.  I already had an A.A. degree so most of my core classes are taken care of.  It's all math and science from here on out and it might take me another three years to finish, but I'm determined to finish.  Wish me luck!
