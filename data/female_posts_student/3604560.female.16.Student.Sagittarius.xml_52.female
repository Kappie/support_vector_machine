(and u still owe us a b'day wants' list!)  man i wanna go ice skating...but i'll prolly fall like every second or soemthing - me and my ditziness....  mel - if u can't find a pic, i'm pretty sure u can draw it - how to draw it is a problem with me...i'm just gonna ask whitehead or cherry or betty or something....it's not due till second week...just enjoy the time u hav with teh snow  i finished pride and prejudice and trying to get teh video off teh library...its not a bad book...i can see why u liked it divs :)  omg u guys hav to promise me to watch teh season finale of charmed - that's nat's sis who always watch it and loves chris liek me!, divs, mary, marty, eve and marija. It is a really good finale.

[edit] can someone explain why there are stuff like '----shire' in the pride and prejudice book? it's like its being censored? go to page 297 for lots of examples...
