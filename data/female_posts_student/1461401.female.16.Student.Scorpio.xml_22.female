Kari, the only reason I'm not talking to you right now is so I DON'T SAY WHAT I REALLY WANT TO SAY TO YOU! GOD DAMN IT, YOU HAVE TO STOP! YOU ARE THE MOST IMMATURE PERSON I'VE EVER MET! You make me madder than I have been in so long. Now don't think that I'm just being angst, or that this has anything to do hormones. I'M MAD AT YOU. ACCEPT IT. DEAL WITH IT. You've ruined so many things for me. It's kind of hard for me to not be mad at you. ~Me
