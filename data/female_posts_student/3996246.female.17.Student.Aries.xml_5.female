I didn't mean to hurt his feelings but I think I might have...I didn't say anything mean, I just told him some things I've wanted to say to him for a while. Every girl in Pictou County wants this guy and he's always accidentally leading girls on and complaining to me how he feels bad for hurting peoples feelings, he's such a sweet guy, and I usually listen to him. He always puts everyone else first and himself second and gives himself no credit when girls mess with his head and try to put the guilt trip on him when he doesn't want them. But tonight he was complaining about being torn between two girls and I told him to "grow the fuck up and start taking people's feelings into consideration because what you're doing is a tad bit grade 9, don't you think?" or something, and then I continued on into a big speal on him basically ripping him apart.  Some new guy at work flipped on me tonight for no reason and said that I'm snotty and stuck up and think I'm better than everyone else and that I take jokes "too far." It's strange how that works seeing how I get along with everyone there, and I'm always really nice to the guy...it's not my fault that everyone there likes me and knows how to take my jokes and he just gets his panties in a twist.  So I told him to eat a dick and shut his fucking mouth...
