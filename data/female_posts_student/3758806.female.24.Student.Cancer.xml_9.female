I woke up this morning and had a hot bowl of oatmeal while sitting out in a chair on the dock by the water, while wearing a big wooly sweater (it gets chilly in the mornings).  A family of ducks swam by.  And I felt like I was in a commercial.  Was tempted to belch or something just to break the tension.    I'm off to do some more editing of "Vodkadvice"... I'm organizing a script reading for the end of July, and I want the script to be as clean as possible by then.  Also, I was offered a job as an editor at a publishing house... On one condition.  I have to pass the editing test with 100%.  Gaah!  No pressure, right?  They're going to e-mail me the text this morning.  I'll keep everyone posted on how that goes.  Yikes.  Hmm, maybe I'll go for a swim before I edit.
