Learning to say no is something on my  To Do List.  Yesterday morning I had some personal stuff to take care of, then I came home and took a nap. Or, some what of a nap. Hard to actually sleep with So and Mo running around. Pretty much just did the mom routine and got them to bed at a decent time. Remember, it was Thursday. Thursday is pool night for Superfly. It is also "no boyfriend night"--for superfly. So I meet her at the Marine Corps post and then we proceed to  The Bar.  She decides that since she has already consumed four beers, that drinking a pitcher with me of Miller Light, would be ok.  Ah, the stuff of dreams.  Anyway, I wanted to hear a few songs, and I usually always give up a dollar for each song so  I can hear them now.  Play Nows are basically just a way to get rich. I didn't hear my first song till about a half hour after I played them. Plus we were outside on the patio, so it was hard to even hear them at all. The two guys from last week were outside and Superfly spotted them right away. I don't think I mentioned in the previous post about last Thursday, but she had exchanged numbers with one of them, well actually, she had me get his number and I accidentally got the wrong number. Switched up the 0 with an 8. =\ So he was waiting all week to hear from her, while she was calling some other guy, surprisingly with the same name.  Small world.  So the five of us were standing outside looking around for a picnic table to become available, when this other group of guys told us which tables were being saved and which weren't. Just making jokes and talking in general. Those are the type of boys that attract the ladies, not shy and just all around cocky, but in a good way. Superfly and I played a long game of  ping pong-  Sitting with the boys from last week, then getting up and standing with the 'new boys'.     Mr. Bigpants...     I happened to turn around while in the middle of conversation with 'Scuba Steve', and I noticed this pair of eyes staring at me.  He walked over, said Hi, gave me a hug and in thirty minutes we had left the bar.      -----------      sports.....
