Anyhoo, camp was interesting today.  We played hangman this morning.  First word: love.  After they guess the word, they sculpt their clay to represent the word.  Sounds like a great activity, right?  Until I ruin it by saying:  "Okay, now you can make love with your play-dough."  Oh, the scandulous phrases that just seem to slip out!  I'm changing the subject to courage.  Something which I once lacked but now realize I have developed.  I am debating whether to act upon something, and it is driving me nuts.  Then I think of the quote: "Good things come to those who wait."  Okay, so I won't act.  But then this one comes to mind:  "He who hesitates is lost."  Fudge it all.  If I don't do something then I will live in an inner hell (which we don't want to happen again).  And don't worry--I do not believe I am being hasty.  Not at all.  Just courageous.  And not blind courage.  Very visible courage.  It's one of those things that if I don't do by the end of this week, it will be a lost cause.  But I'm afraid I will fuck things up again.  I tend to do that.  Come on, Megan!  Pressure's on!
