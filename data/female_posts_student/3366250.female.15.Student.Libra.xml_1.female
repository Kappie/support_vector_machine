HA yah right just kidding. :P i got a new journal, it's so rad. it's pretty big too, i've writting a couple pages in it. it's mostly about *him* and all the personal conflicts that are corrupting my mind. there is this one guy on myspace that im kind of interested in, but we're just friends, and plus he lives far far away. so nothing would ever become of us, so it doesn't really matter. but he is just oh so perfect. i wish we had guys like that, that lived here. but of course we don't. nothing ever good is here.   last weekend i went to brynn's house on friday with caleb and we watched Eurotrip. and went out to eat, and just talked all night. and i came home around 11. then saturday i hung out with her that night and we watched seabiscuit, and stuck on you. seabiscuit was good, stuck on you sucked. then sunday i did homework and went online. last weekend was a chill weekend for me, i did like nothing. the first weekend like ever that i basically did nothing.  i think i want an emu as a pet. and name him emo. that would be nice. and then all my other friends would have emu's and they would all have tea time together like one big happy family! and we'd live in this huge mansion where there would be over 2000 rooms. and we would always get lost in it, and we would play hide and go seek with all of our emu's. ooh wouldn't that be lovely? i would just love that.  i need to stop living in a fantasy world, where all my troubles would be gone and that everything would be perfect. i need to get rid of my problems on my own and just relax. i need to get my head in the right place and stop worrying about boys, and when im going to fall in love or not. my time will come, but it already has. and i guess i just have to move on and accept the facts.  im meeting soo many new people its amazing. i love it. im better friends with the new people that i have met, then with the friends i have here. like everytime i am online im not talking to anyone here im talking to all the new people i have met. so far i have met 62 new people. wow. i have more friends than phil!! whoo hoo!!   i think that's all for now. ill be sure to update a lot more a lot sooner, no more big gaps in the updating process.
