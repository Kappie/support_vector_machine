We laughed for a while....I think it's a girl thing.  My fish, Derek, has Tail Rot for the past month or so now. Since he was only like 12 cents I didn't want to but stuff for him and I thought he was going to die like.....a month ago. lolz. BUT the tough somma bitch is still alive and swimming with no fins whatsoever. lolz...It's kind of sad but yea. I wanted to freeze him because that's the most human way, but my pops wont let me...so I guess he will have to suffer the hell in his tank. I'm sorry Derek I love you man!  Today or tonite rather, I'm going to the movies with Karen, Anna, and myself to see THE VILLAGE. ooooohhhhhh. Scary.....ahhhhhh. By Night M. Shyamalan...ramam lama lama ding dong. Yea so I hope it'll be decent, I haven't been to the movies in a LONG time....I think the last time I went I saw "Day without a mexican" But yuh. Jenn wanted to go to the movies but when she heard we was seein' THE VILLAGE she didn't want to go. Me here. I'm a scary movie gal and she ain't. So yeps...  Oh on Sunday I'm going to hang with my chicas Anna and Tiffany. Uhhh...lolz. I don't know what we're doing but it'll be fun we never seem to have a dull moment. ya ya.  I think I like a guy...  P.S. My uterus still hurts....... RaH!! GrRrrrr
