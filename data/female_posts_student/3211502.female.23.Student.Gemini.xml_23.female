And, finally, when on the phone with Garth (I hid it from him, though), I broke down. One of the patient presentations in the Clinical Demonstration was extremely sad, yet inspiring.   The patient, RS, was in his early 50s, and had been diagnosed with Huntington's Disease (HD) about three years ago. During the patient presentation, the neurologist leading the demonstration conducted a cognitive evaluation of the patient. From the patient's responses as well as his speech and demeanor during the presentation, it was apparent that he was suffering from various cognitive difficulties.  Throughout the presentation, RS's wife was sitting right next to him, helping to answer questions and giving her perspective. I kept watching her throughout their segment of the clinical demonstration. At times, she seemed to look embarrassed, but, for the most part, she looked like a woman who was sad, yet trying so hard to be strong, not only for herself, but for her husband as well.   And, what was extremely touching about RS and his wife was that the love that the two of them shared was so apparent. At one point during the presentation, when RS noticed that his wife was having an emotional reaction while answering a question about how the dynamic of their family has changed since his diagnosis. He reached over and affectionately rubbed her shoulder and arm. Later on in the presentation, he wished the class well and hoped that we would all be able to find someone like "P" (his wife) to have in our lives.  It was so sad at the same time. With HD, it seems as though RS's situation can only worsen. And the disease will not only affect his own physical, mental, and emotional health, but it was also greatly impact his family as well. I couldn't help but feel sad and want to cry.
