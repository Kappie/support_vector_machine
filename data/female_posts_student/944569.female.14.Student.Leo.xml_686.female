If anyone is feeling lonely on msn, you can add this address to ur contacts. It is a robot friend, it tells you anything you want to know from the weather and what movies are playing at theatres. IT is really helpfull.Start by saying hi with it and it will tell you everything it can do: absc0302@activebuddy.com. Hope to see you all soon!
