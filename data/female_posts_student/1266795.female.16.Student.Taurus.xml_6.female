It was much fun, although it was somewhat stressful. AH well. The movie was good. I enjoyed myself, alhtough I am quite tired now, so yeah. I am repeating myself.  So yeah. WE ARE JUNIORS!!! WOOHOO! In Algebra today I didn't do anything. It was great. So much fun for me. I got SOOOOOOO bored though. Everyone was asking me what was on the French final. argh. They didn't understand what I was trying to tell them and I was getting quite frustrated when they didn't understand. Ah well. An hour wasted. And then I took my Latin final. It was SO easy! Ah well. I am glad to have it finished.  Well, Alison's kicking all your butts in my quotes. She has 480 points. Olivia still has 160, and Michael has 10. Why is no one else joining in?? They're quite fun!! And Ali was right. Horace said What prevents me from telling the truth with a smile? Good job Alison!! Woohoo! Next! Mea mihi conscientia pluris est quam omnium sermo. Have fun with that one! Well, I'll let you go now....btw...  I (still) GOTS EARS!!!!
