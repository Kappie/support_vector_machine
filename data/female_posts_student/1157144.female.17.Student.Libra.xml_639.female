They hellsa showed up at my house randomly, and so then we went over to Houge and stuff, and yeah. Brad was like "You should call your friends and have them come over here" and I was like "Yeah!!" But then I realized that I don't know anyone's cell # or whatever, so I was like "damn." But yeah, really wish y'all were there, his friends are cool. And yeah, now I have possession of Brad's hat...mwuahahaha...but yeah, where is everybody??
