( urlLink The article in question .)  What struck me was how abstract, and yet cool and hyper-modern CNN's picture is. It looks more like the cover art for a new Anthrax album if Anthrax were to turn into a pop-alternative band than like the scary anthrax bacteria.   Needless to say, I'm really not sure what the picture has to do with anything other than having the word 'anthrax' written across it and having some quasi-bacterial shapes on it. Good job CNN! Clearly one of your graphic designers was bored and needed an assignment. I suggest that you also replace all of your photographs of world leaders with editorial cartoons depicting them. That would make reading the news much more fun.
