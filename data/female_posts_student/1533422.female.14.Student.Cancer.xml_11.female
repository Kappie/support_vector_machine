It started off being alright (hee, none of the boys like Clare, and most of them would go out with me, according to Dan, and even he said he would, even after everything he's done to me.  There's no way in a million years that I would ever go out with Dan ever, he's soo horrible.  But still.  And it looks like I'm better prepared for Fousseau than Clare, if we really are all going to go out with someone.  Mel's going to ask out Tom, but he likes Lucy.  Awww ...) but then at lunch Pooj and I found Clare's bag (she'd lost it at break) gave it back to her, and then everyone was going, "Oh my God, you nicked it, didn't you?"  Mel asked us separately where we found it, and she was being soo confusing about it.  We found it outside the exit between E3 and the toilets in the EDM block, and Mel goes, "You know when you go in the English block, and you go to the left and then up there, was it outside the first door or the second door?"  I said first door, thinking she meant the second one was the one right at the end.  Pooj said second door, thinking she meant the first one was the one between the staff room and E1.  So we had different answers - I still don't know what the hell Mel meant - and Lucy goes, "You've just blanked yourselves out."  What a bitch!  Why would we steal Clare's bag?  It's so pathetic!!  Now Clare's not talking to me :S she was blanking me all the way through ICT.  If you think about it, Clare's not talking to us because we did her a favour.  I wish we'd just bloody left it there now.  Lool, my sister just came in with leftover helium balloons from her party.  The best thing to say in a riduculous sqeaky voice is, "I love you baby, and if it's quite alright I love you baby, on the lonely night I need you, baby ..."  Yeah.  My MSN name at the moment is "I love you ******, and if it's quite alright I love you ******, on the lonely night I need you ******" lool.  (Psst ... the stars stand for Andrew, but he might come online, and Michael's online anyway, so mayby it's best to leave them blank.  Jeremery's trying to find out who it is, though.)  Katherine's just gone clubbing. *Sniffs* My big sister's growing up.  And she's found my blog, too *growls* take one last look, Ko, cuz I'm changing the address. Ha har! Not so clever now, are you?!  I'm booored.  No one's online, except Billy (who's started talking to me *shudders* freakoid, PISS OFF), some spaz I don't know, J.M., Birdie, Michael and Jeremery.  Why can't Andy come online or something? Lool, look at my convo with Billy.      (8) shel be right here in my arms so in love, shel be right here in thees arms she cant let go (8) says:  i herd dt asong   (8) shel be right here in my arms so in love, shel be right here in thees arms she cant let go (8) says:   inme   (F)(8) I'm holding you, holding you close to me, cuz you are my angel (8)(F) Why has no one heard that song? says:   yup  (8) shel be right here in my arms so in love, shel be right here in thees arms she cant let go (8) says:   it kool   (F)(8)I'm holding you, holding you close to me, cuz you are my angel (8)(F) Why has no one heard that song? says:   yeah   (8)shel be right here in my arms so in love, shel be right here in thees arms she cant let go (8) says:   kool    (F)(8)I'm holding you, holding you close to me, cuz you are my angel (8)(F) Why has no one heard that song? says:   dude  (8) shel be right here in my arms so in love, shel be right here in thees arms she cant let go (8) says:   k  I HATE it when people say "k".  It should be outlawed.  "kkk" is even worse.  Argh, I could KILL anyone who says it.  DIE BILLY DIE.  God, he's so annoying.  And a right minger, too - why oh why do loadsa girls fancy him?  That's like me saying, "I FANCY HORVATH, HE'S DEAD SEXY." Well, maybe not quite.  But almost, almost.   :O Andy and Michael don't like Jeremery! Must sort this one out ... but damn, they've all gone on study leave. Well, actually, Jeremery only has five days of school left. Noo! I almost forgot! Must have teary farewells from all the U6 ... lool, and then you see them the next day and it's like, "D'oh! I went through all that for nothing!"   HAHAHAHAHA.  Clare came online, right?  So I changed my name to, "Okay, so we do 'em a favour and now they hate us? IS THIS A DEMOCRACY? *Is on helium high, take no notice people*"  So she says to me - argh! Noo! I got rid of it! I'll make it up then - "who hates you? cuz mel's just paranoid and crazzzy" or something like that. I said, "Yeah."  AND NOW SHE'S BLOCKED ME!!  HAHAHAHAH!  Now she can't say I'm a bitch, because I gave her her bag back and now she's blocked me.  What a charmer you are, Clare.  Hmm.  The bassist from INME is fine.  Charlie Ross doesn't think so.  Eh, she went out with Mattie Rowledge and he's a crime against human nature.  (I would show y'all the picture of him dressed up as a girl, but I don't want to de-flower your virgin eyes.  It's really not a nice sight.)  I'm going to go now.  Pooj wants me to publish.  (Take that horrible pic OFF, Pooj - he's disgusting!  The Way are not a joke, people!)  Aurevoir! *~Jools~*
