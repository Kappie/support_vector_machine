We're thinking beach towels, chairs, tables, food, and 4 mats of Twister put together for one massive orgy Twister. And a boom box with better music than what leadership picks out. Hella. Soooooo, if you can, bring food and whatnot on Monday for lunch. I'll try to bring some dessert food or something.   And I know we're all mentioned this between ourselves, but we really need to get everyone together so that we can all sign each other's yearbooks at someone's house for long periods of time. If anyone can volunteer their house or whatever, that'd be awesome. Or we could go to a park to do it, and have like a pinic or something. Either Monday after school or one of the other days after that would be good for signing, I think.   Last thing -- we still need to exchange Senior Portraits, people, so maybe when we sign each other's yearbooks, we can swap pics as well.   Rawr. My face is peeling. Goddamn sunburns.
