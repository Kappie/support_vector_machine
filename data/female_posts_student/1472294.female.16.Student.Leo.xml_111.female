And read Sunday Life's comics section. I loved it!!! Then had lunch and watched The Tick. I like The Tick, it is very different from the normal superheroes... I hope I can remember my Neopets password. I forgot and worse, they sent my password to who-knows-where!!! I think it links to my manga as I was quite crazy about it that time and changed reguarly to my title....  How, how HOW?!?!
