I woke up not really caringif I did anythingand I think I ended the day with people thinking I was desperate to do something with them, and that's not the case. I dont want anyone thinking I'm some typical needy girl whose desperate to do things all the time, because I'm not, but I'm scared that I come off that way. I'm not one of those psycho bitches,like the girl I dealt with all this weekend, who thinks that they own a guy because she screwed around with him. I'm sorry, but that is a prime example of a stupid girl. If you are pretending to just want to have fun, but really have some aort of agenda to tie some poor guy up, then you're just screwing yourself over. But then there are those guys that do really annoying things. Okay, just because they have dealt with the desperate little "call you every 5 minutes, down your back 24/7" kind of girls I have described, doesnt mean you have to treat every girl like that just to protect yourself from having baggage to deal with. I mean, what ever happened to screwing around, having fun, and still hanging out being friends? I dont know why things always have to be weird, its almost like you want things to get boring and go sour. I dont understand it, so there. Thats all I got...
