So minor studying this weekend, and I hope to get work done on my paper. I'm debating whether to bring the computer or leave it and write the paper by hand to force myself to edit. Hmmm.   Also, had a nice time wandering around Davis with Melissa after my long week. I forget how much fun Melissia is, and how I feel like I've dealt with my issues more. She's such a therapist. She's great.
