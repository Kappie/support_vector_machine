I literally SCREAMED!! I SCREAMED!! LoL. Then, I had to text 3 people, and write it on the message board, for an hour we were all freaking out. But, like 3 seconds before Ludo was announced the winners, Matt told me that this guy (he should remain unknown, lol) wants to produce 3 songs from Matt forbasically nothing plus expenses then going to "shop me a record deal (with the help of his manager)!" I freaked!! OMG!! How awesome is that?!?!?!?!?!?! I couldn't be happier for him. He totally deserves it. Right now, he's concert is going on. I hope he's having fun.            OMG!! I just watched FFF on Jay Leno.. **sigh**that just added to my best day. Ok, now back to my story....            anyways, when I got the mail, My package from Reign Kings was there!! I ran back inside.. There was a LOT of stuff in there!! I got a signed CD, a poster that says: To Breena Our #1 Fan! Thank you!!! And I got a Bio page, and a group picture, and Iron on's and get this: a CD release pass!! It was from Feb. But that still rocks! Those guys (and girl) are soo awesome. Rhonda says that she can't wait to meet me on the Message board. Scottie is awesome too, I want to talk to the other pplz.. lol.            I keep thinking about Matt, I know that he is on the top of the world. Hedeserves it. I hope his albums goes platinum 100 times :P He is soo sweet I told him I would live in LA for a year, and after thinking about it, That might be cool. I can go to an Elly K concert too :P That would be awesome. Well, I guess that's everything.            ~~Breena \m/(>_
