Imagine for a moment packed emergency rooms at 1:00am with understaffed personnel, earning half of what they once did, trying with little motivation to get patients in and out while caring very little about curing.  Closed medical tech plants that once produced state of the art treatments for Cancer and Diabetes now being used as warehouses for more profitable businesses.  Imagine more and more specialists, no longer capable of making extraordinary advances in fields of medical science, instead work as general practitioners because they have lost the financial incentive to strive for more.  This is not a third world country, or Russia after the fall of communism, this is America after it’s lost itself.  Our country flourishes in all fields because of the dedication and innovation of the individual capitalist mind that seeks only their due reward for success.    The topic has brought to light that the United States is the only highly industrialized nation without socialized health care.  I would also like to bring to light that of all existing highly industrialized nations, America is the only one that is free, the only one that strives on Capitalism, the only nation in the free work which is actually free.  By selling medical care as a “commodity” to those who can afford it, we evade the many, many problem which are associated with socialized medical care.  When medical care is socialized, the quality of treatment is no longer worth its true value, but becomes worth what the government is willing to pay for it.    In a sense, the United States already provides a form of very limited socialized medical care to those who are judged needy, we call this socially undermining invention “Medicaid.”  If we were to take a quick look at Medicaid, we would find that the health care provided by this program is worse than unacceptable, it is the lowest quality care, provided by the most uncaring under-qualified doctors who can’t get jobs anywhere else.  On another side of the very same coin we have what we have so lovingly called “free clinics” where we find the same horrid health care, by the same under-qualified doctors.  Consider for a moment why a doctor who spent 12 years or more in medical school would work for free or for what the state is willing to pay him?    If we were to socialize medicine, who would pay for the expense of research and development?  Would the government?  Yes, however they would make the money to pay for this very expensive endeavor with our tax money.  Now, since the rich pay in the highest tax bracket, and doctors make a considerable amount of money, image for a moment what would happen to the economic state of this country if we took away a major source of governmental tax income. Now, our countries doctors are not only unmotivated by the lack of their own income, but they are also paying for a good deal of the research and development it costs to treat the sick they are not even being paid very well to cure.    America is a country that is free to its very fundamental core, a country where the government has a very limited role in the day to day life of its citizens.  Immigrants from other countries still flock to America to live under our Democratic society.  America is a country that promises prosperity and freedom for all.  Socialized medicine steals the very meaning of the word prosperity and steals from those who seek our freedom their given right to be prosperous.  When other countries need medical assistance to cure some new disease, it is America with all of our prosperity to which they look.  It is America who answers their calls for help willingly.  High quality health care is dependent on and the result of research and dedication.  Putting a prince on health care provides the necessary financial motivation to continue to provide high quality health care and better the field of medicine. In a country where competition breeds quality, success, and motivation, socialized health care, like all other social programs, undermines the foundation of our country, capitalism.    ~Kristyn Hammond
