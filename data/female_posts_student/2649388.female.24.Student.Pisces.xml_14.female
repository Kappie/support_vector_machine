Now people can post comments ... thou I am not sure how many people will actually do so.  Haven't been in good mood for a long awhile ... Don't ask me why.  I haven't quite figured it out myself yet. (not like I will publicly blog about it once I figure it out anyway)  Just got back from the family trip to Canada.  Loved Montreal and Quebec, but again, too lazy to blog about it ... maybe I will blog about it later, or maybe not.  Maybe the topic will just sit there until the time window expires ... like everything else that I wanted to blog about and ended up not to.  Sometimes I wonder, what's the point of blogging, if it's so public and everyone else can read it (whether you like it or not).  Everytime before I write something, I have to pause and think: do I really want this to be publicly discussed?  Maybe I will start another private blog ... or maybe I will just keep a private diary of my own ... or maybe, again, I will be too lazy/busy and ended up not doing anything about it.  I should stop ranting.
