Ahh... as of now, no graduation ceremonies for moi... dunno if it's the sudden lack of interest, or the fact that there's other festivites going on that I'd like to attend, needless to say I'm not planning on attending '04 grad, which in the long run, is most likely gonna come back to bite me in the ass.  As Tan put it, we have most of our EXTREMELY gorgeous men leaving us tonight, which, indeed will be sure to shed tons of tears, so maybe that's the reason I'm not going.  Anyyyways... today was tons of fun... ya'll know what I'm talking about... celebrating is always a good time with the pals, but today was a outright blast haha.  As for this evening, I really need to get some massive energy, and very soon if I'm going to do everything I've got planned, which includes: dress fitting @ 6, then POSSIBLY graduation ceremonies, depending on the time and what not, so doubt it... then coming home for a bit... and outtie for the night :)... tomorrow though, shall suck the big dick.  Tomorrow most-likely includes a massive lack of sleep, and work from 2-9... yes no fun there! Anyways, time to get my ass in gear... HOPEFULLY tonight all goes well... with the lack of shedding tears :-/  Love ya's!
