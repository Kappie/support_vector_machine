Don't want to write anymore...i'm done.One more thing though, after the homily i heard from Church, i've never been more confused in my life...and no depressions now...i'm done with th carbo-loading and choco-craving! YEEEEESSS! But i have a very pounding headache...why do women have to suffer this PMS?Argh! But then, given the choice, given a chance to choose if i want to become a man or a woman, i still would have preferred to be a woman...Love being me! :-)
