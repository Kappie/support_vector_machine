Apparently, the digital signals make the FM stations have the quality of a CD. One set back to this great idea is that people do not have digital radio receivers, and Kenwood, a company that recently began making the receivers, priced such a devise at about $500. Also, the Federal Communications Commission has been asked by the Recording Industry Association of America to prohibit the use of digital radio because of the possible widespread piracy.  Since we just visited the radio broadcasting station, I thought this article was relevant to what we have been covering. In our textbook, there is the mention of digital radio and names the lack of receivers for digital signals as the reason why digital radio hasnâ€™t taken off. I am not sure of the entire process to making digital radio system works, but if the quality of the sound is improved than I think it should at least be tried. I am sure that if the public ends up not liking the digital radio, radio stations will hear about it. The only loss is to the radio companies. By acquiring digital radio signals, large radio companies like Clear Channel could move to using these. Meanwhile the traditional FM signals could be given to the small, local radio broadcasting stations. If I were the F.C.C., I would definitely be looking at these possibilities. What do you think about adopting digital radio? Or, should we stick with what has worked for decades?
