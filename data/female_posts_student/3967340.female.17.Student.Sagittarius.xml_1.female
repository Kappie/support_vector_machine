So many people think that they have found it when in reality they have just lowered their standards to avoid being alone. One of my bests... there he is so crazy about one girl and her "friends" are making her life miserable. So being the sweet, caring, wonderful guy that he is he is going to do whatever it takes to make her happy. And that means putting aside her emotions."Fall,with you i fall so fast.... i can hardly catch my breathe i hope it lasts." We all think we found that person and slowly but surely their faults come out and we either look past it or end it right there. WE all need to know that nobody is perfect and we need to get it through our head. Love is it all just an allusion.
