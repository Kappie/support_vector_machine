Today I had the AP Spanish Language Test. It was hard and long. The speaking part was TERRIBLE! It was so bad, we're just not even going to discuss it. Spanish is taking over my life, I'm so sick of it. IT SHOULD DIE. Nothing really funny happened today. Oh, I had to go to B Day's lab today. I was partners with Megan Quinn-that was fun. She was playing with the eyewash and pulled the trigger and it sprayed up, but it was directly under a wooden shelve and the wood got all wet. It was nice, then Doc pulled it out and pretended to spray her and she was running around the room. Then she was going to rub something all over her to turn her skin black, and she was singing around the chemicals, I laughed really hard. Then SAM PARSONS-little brat I am going to kill her-was the curve breaker on our test! I started screaming and Doc got scared. CP locked her keys in her car so we hung out after school. I got home at like 5, better than yesterday, but I'm just so tired. I need ice cream scoopers for the tutoring party tomorrow-if you have any PLEASE BRING THEM! THANKS. Oh ps FOX FOREVER called my house today to discuss the party-it was crazy!  I leave you with:  e c 2 4 4 2: We just use spoons around here for the ice cream e c 2 4 4 2: When there's food in the house, haha
