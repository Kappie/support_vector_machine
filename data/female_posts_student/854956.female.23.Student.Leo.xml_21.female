Yeah... we had planned on sleeping in Saturday.  Didn't happen.  My Mom woke up at 6ish, and I woke up around 9ish.  Then I watched some movies that came on.  In between that and the evening, I read some of the book I have to read for my World Civilizations class.  I have to use it to write a paper that's due a week from Friday.  So, you can guess what a portion of my Thanksgiving weekend will be comprised of.  It just kinda bites.  I'm anticipating the end of the semester, but I'm not anticipating the finals and papers and such that are due.  Oh well, it's part of the game.    I'm just ready for this semester to be done with.  I'm ready for the break.  I'm wanting to have a job again!  I miss working with kids so much.  I've had several dreams in the past two weeks about the kids I worked with at the Center.  It makes me sad.  I won't be able to do daycare stuff next semester and that makes me sad.  I'll have to just wait to do that until the summer.  My schedule for the Spring just will NOT let me work at a childcare or preschool facility.  Too much class stuff going on in the afternoon.  I may get a job somewhere next semester, but it's not all that likely.  That's the convenience of living at home, not having bills, and not HAVING to work.  So, we'll see.  Okay, well, now I must go to study, study, study for my last world civ. quiz.  I'm not looking forward to it.  Not at all.  But, I'm looking forward to getting the reading of The Crusaders out of the way hopefully BEFORE Thanksgiving.  It's not a terribly long book.  So if I can get it read before Thanksgiving, then I can spend the rest of the time after that compiling my data, and piecing my paper together.  That'd be nice.  :-)  Alright, kiddies.  I'll try to post something tomorrow, but if I don't, I'll post something before I go to Kerrville for Thursday and Friday, and then I'll update about Thanksgiving when I get back in town.        urlLink  postCount('25Nov2002');
