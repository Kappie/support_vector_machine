Today I attended 3 services... yup.. but by the 5pm onez.. was kinda drowsy... can't be helped.. I'm a late bird.. I slept at 1am++...I know this entry might sound boring to some of you.. I've changed my blog music again... Boredom.. I'm currently experiencing it.. Ever so proud of my sweet lil' siblings...but most of 'em seems to be so damn busy.. No idea why..but it just seems like I'm too free.. No homework... in ITE.. it's juz slack slack slack.. SLACK ALL THE WAY..But my week seems much better.. due to much prayers.. God's help... He's always there whenever I'm troubled..Now I gotta pray  pray.. that my bad habits can be eliminated...don't wanna mention 'em... BLEAH.. Today.. all 3 services.. 3 different sermons! AMEN! Thank God it wasn't the same one again for 8am  10.30am service ... or else I would be yaking away for 10.30am service again... anyway.. PRAISE THE LORD FOR A GREAT DAY!!
