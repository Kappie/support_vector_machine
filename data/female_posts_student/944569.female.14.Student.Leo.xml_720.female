Make sure you save the world and clean away all that oil, squalor and filth that are attempting to choke out the lives of our dear penguin, fish and fellow residents of our sweet mother Earth.  Do your job with pride.  I-  WHY AM I TALKING TO MY HAIR?!  HAVE I GROWN SO ATTACHED TO IT THAT...?  AUGH!!!!!!
