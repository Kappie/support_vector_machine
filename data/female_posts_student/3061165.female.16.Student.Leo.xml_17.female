Maths I got 29/60(1 mark), physics 19/45(3 marks) and chemistry 21/45(2 marks)! So due to the large nu,ber of failures for these subjects, they caould only afford to give those who got F9s in the subjects! Yay~ ^^ Okay, back to Today...  Today, we had physics lesson doing some xperiment.. After the xperiment, Jason(n i didnt do anythin 2 stop, was enjoying actualli) somehow managed to loosen some nichrome wire on the ruler, turned the batteries upside down and hammered them in and messed the virable resistor thingy! Haha... Wonder which pair later taking Physics would hav our table? Anyway, after i went back 2 class i noticed my wallet was GONE! It's the 2nd time oready... Lucky lucky lucky for me, I managed to find it in the science lab and thank God again that everything was safe and untouched. =) Anyway, today's Sherilyn's b'dae n she's carryin lots of presents! Haha.. Didnt get her anythin cuz i didnt know its her bdae.. Well.. then again.. even if i knew i will not make de effort 2 go n buy.. hahax.. ^^"  After skool we had a boring SS-SSS! Haix...
