HOWEVER, THERE ARE TIMES WE AS INDIVIDUALS MUST ASK FOR AND ACCEPT FAVORS.  ~~~  Thought these two songs were interesting... kinda self-reflective right now. I'm discovering the use of song lyrics to understand how we are not alone. From  VNV Nation .   When I have nothing left to feel. When I have nothing left to say I'll just let this slip away.  I feel these engines power down. I feel this heart begin to bleed as I turn this burning page.  Please forgive me if I bleed. Please forgive me if I breathe. I have words I need to say. Oh so very much to say.  And whose life do I lead? And whose blood do I bleed? Whose air do I breathe? With whose skin now do I feel?  I'm supposed to walk away from here. I'm supposed to walk away from here.  And whose life do I lead? Whose blood do I bleed? Whose air do I now breathe? I'm convinced there's nothing more.  What am I supposed to do? Is there something more?  The engines power down. Like a soldier to his end I go. Because I'm convinced that there is nothing more.  and whose life do I lead and whose air do I breathe? With whose skin and whose blood do I feel?  What happens now? Have I done something wrong?  Forgive my need to bleed right now. Please forgive my need to breathe But I've so much to say and it wouldn't matter anyway. You're not here to hear these words that I must say and I'm convinced inside that there is nothing more.  Whose life do I lead? Whose air do I breathe. Whose blood do I now bleed? With whose skin now do I feel?  I have nothing left to say. I have nothing left to feel. Am I supposed to let this go now, let darkness come and take me away?    ~~~~~  Eyes betray the soul and bear it's thinking. Beyond words they say so many things to me. A stranger here reborn it seems awaking wonders deep in me. If nothing's ventured nothing's gained so I must seize the day.  And fighting time so hard I pray that this moment lasts forever. And will the world stay standing still at least for me. Through my eyes stare into me. I bear my heart for all to see. With my face turned to the sun there ever standing still.  It wasn't you it wasn't me it wasn't anyone. It was a day so long awaited and a chance to be as me. I let the wind run through my hands as I turned to walk away. In distant days I long to sense it all so clear.  And fighting time so hard I pray that this moment lasts forever. And will the world stay standing still at least for me. Through my eyes stare into me. I bear my heart for all to see. With my face turned to the sun there ever standing still. And fighting time so much I ask. I will this morning last forever. Though seasons change and things come to pass remain inside of me. And fighting time so hard I pray that this moment lasts forever. and will the world stay standing still at least for me.  I had no faith before that day in any vow or deed. Days followed days and years were meaningless. Despite the wisdom of defeat I bore my heart for all to see the wonders I'd seen.    ~~~~ Having a long talk with Brad Owens tonight. Alot, if not all of this is based off of that conversation. Here it is..    In my humble opinion...  People look for certain traits in people.  I think people seek traits in others that are non-threatening to themselves... for example... so where alot of individuals see me as independent, that scares them. In this geographic area, girls are "groomed" to be submissive, and guys, particularly, in my experience, want that. Either that regarding traits or people that seek other people that are similar to themselves are less likely to bring themselves into a highly self disclosing atmosphere. People like others like themselves because they don't have to tell them as much, so they don't get hurt as often, or at least they think this is true, but they should find people that are different to befriend b/c when people are with people that have the same problems, dreams, goals, etc they usually do not like the things that they are going through, this translates to the relationship or friendship being negatively intimate and the dislike of things within their own life bleeding to the other, leading to a dislike of the other person.   I find myself in a situation in the great cycle, that is we are completely different form model number to model number, and the struggle to understand what others are trying to convey or either what they are thinking is so often missed.  I think that people just don't "get" me..  I'm so diverse... it bothers people that I have several layers... several interests. As it was said in Shrek, I'm like an onion, I have layers, I can be a very hard person to grasp in one simple swoop. Pardon the cheesy analogy to Shrek.   We are all still searching for the  TRUTH . Logos (logic), Ethos (character) and Pathos (emotional appeal) are elements of rhetoric (the analyzation of speech and artifacts). We use logic, character, and emotion to find ourselves and whatever it is we are looking for.  We describe, reveal, conceal and prescribe things for ourselves all the time.  We describe to ourselves what we perceive to be reality. We reveal what we want others to know, we conceal what we don't, and we prescribe ourselves remedies or senerios all the time. This is how we deal with day to day life.   We carry morals, ethics, and personal motives. This goes back to Jarrett's essay on morals. We are all different. Some of us believe that sex before marriage is wrong, others believe that its ok. Some of us believe that we must not cuss, others don't care. I believe we have to do what makes us happy and what works for us, as long as it doesn't hurt ourselves or others in the process. What befalls us so often is that we don't check with others before we do something. What do you do if lines are crossed in a relationship and the other person is distraught while you are not? How do you confront them? Do you even confront them? What do you do when someone blows you off? Do you lose your cool or are you higher than that?   I think that one thing that we must absolutely work on is competition. We are drilled from the time we are babies to compete. Whether it is competing with siblings for a parent's attention or for equal rights among each other, or in an audition in a musical ensemble, or a political office or for a promotion at work, or simply to be popular, we compete.  Competition is okay ... what is  not  okay is when we take it home and compete with our friends for whatever. We don't need to do this because in the long run we end up  tearing each other down.   We compete for all sorts of junk, but think about it,  what do we really need to compete for on a personal level? Really? Why do we get upset when good friends go out with someone new? Or someone we know? Are we jealous of them going out? Are we upset that we may not be the front-runner for a relationship anymore? Are we upset that we may not get the time we believe we deserve in the future?  So many of us need to take a "chill pill" and just be "loyal as a dog" to our friends.   Lets start there... I wonder what would happen if we all did just that?    The possibilities are endless.
