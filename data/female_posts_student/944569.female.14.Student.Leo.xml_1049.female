The best rides were Ripsaw fall (i went on it 7 times), The Hulk (two times since Derek was too short to get in.  Well, at least we managed to sneak him past the attendants once) and Dueling Dragons (Go, Ice Dragon!  That one's better than Fire.  More loop the loops and upside down turns).  Later, I'm going to this awesome and legendary fondue restaurant with my dad.  It's rumoured to have a haunted women's restroom.  Ppl say that they can hear things from the door.  I can't wait to go in and check.  If i come back posessed by an angry bathroom spirit, i hope you guys know how to perform exorcism!!  I also went to the Coke bottling facility and tasted different typed of coke from around the world.  I then went to see the CNN HQ where they gave a tour.  My mom wants me to be a news anchor when i grow up so it was a good experience... See you all on Monday or....earlier...i dunno....Hasta luego (i practiced my Spanish in Florida a bit)
