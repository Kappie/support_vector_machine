If everything in life goes wrong   And nothing you do seems right,   You just try a little harder   And soon you'll see the light.      For every person who has put you down   And filed your life with pain,   You must strive to achieve gretaness   And show them you can win.      For every disappointment,   For the times you are let down,   There will be a better moment   And your life will turn around.      Because everyone feels heartache   And everyone feels pain,   But only those who have true courage   Can get up and try again.      -Teal Henderson
