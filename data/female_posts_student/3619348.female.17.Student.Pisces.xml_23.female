They are two of the best people I have ever known, and they both seem to care for each other so much…..bah….I am thrilled!  I usually don’t care about the ring, but Emily showed it to me and it IS gorgeous!  The princess diamonds and white gold are nice, but what makes it SO adorable is that Emily said “Oh Camille, he picked it out himself, he did so good!”  Oh gosh, they are so sweet.  I sound like such an airhead, but I honestly don’t do this with every engagement I hear about, this is exceptional.   *tears*
