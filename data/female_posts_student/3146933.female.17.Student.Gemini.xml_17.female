Not much happened today...been on the computer a lot...I think I missed the computer just a little too much.  Jessica B's gettin her hair cut Tuesday and so...she's wantin it kinda like mine so I'm goin with her to help her out! She's goin to the same woman I'm goin to too! Should be fun! Talkin to Patrick Hall right now. Hopin' Monica and I can go watch his church do some dramas and sing some! He's wantin me to meet this Dustin guy that's in his band. Said he's freakin 6'7!! Whoa! Tall guy! But they're best friends so he's gotta be cool! Soooo I agreed!  Brad is so crazy! I was watchin him on his webcam tonight and he crax me up! He'd like start bustin out laughin at these random times...I love it. I hope we can hang out soon. Brad is just...great. No...I didn't forget. I talked to Brett a lot today...since I'm home, he can call my home phone and I don't have to wait until freakin 9 to talk on the phone to people! lol! grr!! He's upset that band camp starts Monday. I would be too...band camp sucks..and I'm not even in band. *sigh* I'm ready to get schedules!! I hope I can change accounting...I heard it sucks. I'm a senior. I want easy classes!! :D hehe! And I'm ready to get the last year outta the way! Buuuuuuuuut anywho...I'm off to bed!...more sleeping...like I need it. *rolls eyes*
