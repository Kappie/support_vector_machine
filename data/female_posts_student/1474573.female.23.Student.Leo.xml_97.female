Usually it's my little brother and his inane questions and absolute REFUSAL to listen to me always get him (or us killed). This time it was someone else . This time we were on earth when the sky was about to get blackened and sentinels were flying through manhattan, so I gather my dad and my aunt and hop into the car and head for canada......before I do though, I call this  other  that i  sometimes  find significant and he's on some " well I wanna ride this end-of-the-world thing out and see where it takes me.....I can't settle down just yet." So I have to convince this idiot that running off to Canada and having sex for the last 3 days of our lives COULD be fine.....so finally he piles into my car with all my other relatives and says to my dad "Nice to finally meet you Mr. Roy" like I've been keeping him from this! now you see why i get mad at people just from dreams I have? I know I have isssues and someone's in the doghouse......  P.S. sorry I haven't been blogging but i've been working on something even BETTER...an actual webSITE equipped with articles, poems, research etc.....and naked pictures of me (for a fee)
