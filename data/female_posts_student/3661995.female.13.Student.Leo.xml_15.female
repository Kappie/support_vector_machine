First I lose my watch, then my water bottle. And now, the computer has to go off and BLOW UP!! Now I can't post any more stories, not with my limited time on the computer... haizzz  Anyway, I've better start preparing for Aishah's birhtday. Atiqah and Amirah said that she wanted either a samurai girl book, or a date with her crush.. uh-uh, I am not going to be match maker for anybody. v_v... no way! Hell, I don't even know how to get a date with a guy, let alone how to help my friend got one! The way I'll probably do it will be : getting up to him, hold a chopper right up to his throat and threaten "If you don't go on a date with my friend Aishah, you'll be a head shorter..." Lol... what would he think? That's we're all psychos?? Probably, and cart us off to the loony bin.  Anyway, there's still time. Maybe we'll just buy her the book. Oh well.  Now back to my computer! Seriosuly, I''m grousing a lot on my blog, don't I? When will my brother fix it????  I just found out a cool japanese bnd recently: Dir en Grey. Yeah, I know it's been on since like a long time ago, but I just saw it not long. They're a bit punkish and kind of goth like, but still pretty cool.
