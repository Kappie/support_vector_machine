Jupiter has moved into the house of Virgo meaning luck, properity, happiness and anything you can wish for! You may not see it now but surely it will light up your future later in this year so keep your head up!! This occurence ends at the end of next year on August 28   BULL SHIT! I must say this has been one of the worst years in my life..lets see:  1) I practically grew away from my friends 2) I almost got arrested TWICE 3) I got dejected from that SCHOOL  4) I never felt so depressed in my whole entire life during half the month of Feburary 5) My friends turned stupid and got into hardcore drugs and alcohol  6) A nice big hopeless romantic spell still goes on... 7) That nice big suspension for 'illegal substances' 8) Having a mental breakdown  9) Just feeling that plain old empty feeling all over and over for NO reason at all 10)Having issues with my self esteem / confidence 11)Feeling stuipd and lonely and like a misfit 12)Figuring out that majority of my friends just have low self esteem problems and do not look forward to the future as much as I do  But then I looked around and found this :    While Virgo is traditionally a modest and disciplined sign, having upbeat and expectant Jupiter here can bring you into line with your greater potential. Expanding your experience through study or travel, or the adoption of a new philosophy on life, are all possibilities. Driving these is a more futuristic and optimistic outlook. The effect of that will be to attract more confident and beneficial associates around you. This is a once in twelve-year opportunity; your generous benefactor has arrived, so move with it. The downside would be doing a Captain Bligh and ultimately landing in the drink.   Dude! Can I ever agree on this. As shitty as my year has gone from the above list...I DID get a new outlook on life...check this list out:  1) Taking philosophy DID give me a new out look on life. Especially the question:      What is life?   I figured I wanted to be a doctor..or some health care      professional 2) I found GOD..something I thought i never would of and through the weirdest time of hardship of this whole year.  3) I travelled to RI in the USA and met so many cool people 4) I never knew I was that outgoing and funny and had 'leadership qualities that can do great things for me'  5) I never knew I was that well like by a bunch of strangers I met for 6 days 6) I have this new plan of taking a year off after grad and travelling around the States and Mexico with a few 'religious professionals'  7) I made new friends and got closer to acquantinces  8) Relay For Life let me know I was NOT alone in my weird social journey 9) I am going back to my homeland where I was born and to Australia, possibly Brazil and Atlanta 10)Possibly and hopefully going to Germany next year for WYD with some American friends 11)Wore a dress for the first time in a couple of years (yes its a huge breakthrough =P) 12)Started becoming more open with myself to myself 13)Finished every single course..well except for Bio..but still 14)I met a few people with the same goals and philosphies as I had  Man the list can go on..I guess I did have a shitacular year but the shit just made me grow up...I guess without everything that happened this whole year, I wouldn't have had learned half the things I did...I guess liek they say ..thats life...i just wish everything was as easy and simple as it was but then i am growing up so problems had to come sometime....well i kno i figured one ting..as much as i am cool with my firends rite now and having such a good time, i kno i dont' wanna be stuck with them forever...i wanna meet new people and see a different side of the world..they are so paranoid about not making friends cuz they are so ashamed of themselves..why? i dont' kno .. my theory is that if u act urself..what is there to be a fraid of?...sometimes i guess peopel are afraid of themselves but honestly i think if eveyrone acted liek their real true selves .. i think that they woudl be even cooler...they jsut gotta realize that..man to be honest..i think i am sick of them sometimes...or maybe i just need time alone to figure things out...it wasn't like that before..i used to LOVE chilling with them..it was so much fun..so somewhere along hte line either  a)I changed and 'matured' b)they changed and 'matured' c)we all changed and 'matured' d)we jus dont' click anymore cuz I havedifferent direction  I say its d). Another thing I know that wherever my life takes me..i just wanna kno that GOD is with me liek I am doin what HE wants me to do..even if it is not what I wanna do..I found God and I dont' wanna loose HIM.   On the other hand here..the horoscope...is it something we shoudl beleive?..soudns freaking beleivable but apparently it is 'evil'...liek so many of the things are beleivable when it comes to personality traits and stuff like that. so that makes u beleive the daily horosope crap like the ones above...half of that stuff has liek happened already...are we lettin the horoscope take over our lives?..liek say we read it in the morning and live our days out..liek we would have the horoscope thing on our minds all day and let wahtever it is happen..then say we read it when the day is over..would the horoscope still make sense?...i don't get it either...liek some peopel put so much trust into these daily horoscope things its ffreaky. In my opinion there is no point to living life anymore if u kno wats goin on. Its liek ur just there to feel teh emotion of it..if u get wat i mean..  [meh..ce la vie]
