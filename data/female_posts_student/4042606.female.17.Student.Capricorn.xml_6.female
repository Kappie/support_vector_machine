I asked Ian to post a review of the game and he said he would think about it. I seriously won't be going anywhere for about a month because of this game. My wood elf scout is on her way to fort frostmoth to solve some problems!, if you are unsure what this game is about then  urlLink click here  and go to it's official website. And to tickle your fancy I have posted a picture of morrowind in action. Ian says I post to many pictures but I don't give a shit.
