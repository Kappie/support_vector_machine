That friend, the one that put me on ignore, I got on a friend of mine's e-mail and sent him a message, here was his reply:  Tha's low...tricking me into reading an email from you..well I was gonna take you off ignore today..but I don't think I will. Hope you're having as much fun as I am. toodles...  He's..having fun..without me... I screw up everything, I really do. I don't want or deserve to walk this earth anymore.
