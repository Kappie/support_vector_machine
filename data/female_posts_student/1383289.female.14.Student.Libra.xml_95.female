But like i dont want ot set my self up for a heart break. weve been going out for 2 freakin weeks. its a good start. kelly and alex have been goin out for like almost 6 months. but then again they dont even talk anymore. i dont want to be like that. i like leo a lot. i luv him. i care about him. right now i cant really remember being with out him. i remember beign kinda down. and hookin up with guys who just wanted head. but with leo its different. he doesnt want that. he actualy want to be with me.  im excited.   i luv leo
