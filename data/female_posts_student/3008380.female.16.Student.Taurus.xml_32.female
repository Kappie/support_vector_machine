Well, summer has been treating me descent, been hanging out with Joel and Sarah and Kyle a lot, which is cool. Been working as well, makin' some moolah, of which I have spent all of my last pay check on Saturday. Yeah, I'm embarrassed. But oh well, I'm going to start saving up for college money, more ear piercings, and XM radio. Not in that order though.  I took a test today and it said that I'm 52% bitch. What do you think?
