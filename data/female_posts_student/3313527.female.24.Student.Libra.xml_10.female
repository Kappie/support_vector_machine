I think it would be really super cool  if everyone who reads this would post a comment  with a few lines of what  you  mean when you say the three magic words. I could be quite a beautiful collaborative poem. Let's keep it to what we mean within the bounds of romantic relationships... if we start getting into what we mean when we say it to mom and dad, this could get really long. Thanks!  What Do You Mean 'I Love You'? 1. I mean that I will make personal sacrifices for  your  greater good.  2. I mean I am irresistably attracted to your Essence, in the limited way I understand it.  3. I mean I am curious/enthralled, and want to learn you inside and out, so I can love your Essence objectively, and know you as a Truth.   4. I mean I trust you implicitly.   5. I mean I am gracious because you help me feel good about myself. My love is a great big 'thank you'.  6. I also mean that I am grateful, slightly in awe and proud that you would allow me to know you so intimately.  7. I mean there is something in each of us that mysteriously draws us closer, and I revel in that.  8. I mean you inspire me.  9. I mean that I accept you no matter what, so please don't be afraid.  10. I mean I believe our time together is a way of praying, and that in loving you I am also closer to loving God.  11...  ...
