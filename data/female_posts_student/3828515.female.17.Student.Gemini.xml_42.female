Apparently it is a paid gig, so I'll get a little fundage out of it :). I played the piano a whole bunch today, and I played Crimson Skies with my brother on Xbox Live. How eventful.     Last song I listened to:   The Luckiest  by Ben Folds.   Last album I listened to:   One For The Kids .   Last meal I ate:  A Whopper from Burger King.   Last movie I watched:   Seabiscuit .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  Umm... The summer band thing. Who else but a band nerd would spend their time doing something like that?   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  Discussing with Dan why Mr. Wheeler was such a terrific teacher.   Last person I talked to:  Melissa.   Favorite song today:   A.W.O.L.  by Yellowcard.   Favorite food today:  I can't say I thoroughly enjoyed anything I ate today.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Improvising a little on the piano. Try it sometime - it's a lot of fun when you're bored :D.   Funniest thing that happened today:  Nothing excruciatingly hilarious took place today :(. It's too bad because I could have used a good laugh :P.
