That i also don't care about my appearance. I'm thinking about trying to be anorexic maybe just for alittle bit. just so i lose some weight, and then ill eat again. If i did that, everything would be better. I have alot of feelings inside that have never come out before. but for some reason they are tonight. I wonder if i became a cutter. would it feel better? would it take the pain away? I need to figure out where the pain is comming from. I still think it goes back to my past with my father.      It's kind of odd, ive never had suicidal thoughts before this. Would people miss me? would they ever notice if im gone? I'm pretty good at hiding whats going on, by staying busy, and trying to be perky and not down. and throwing myself into my music. I am really scared. I just realized im depressed, but i don't want people to know.  I know on one hand i shouldn't be depressed because i have a wonderful boyfriend, im good at playing piano and singing. But on the other hand, im fat, and getting fatter, I have been really sick, and stressed because of all the schoolwork and stuff. I still think if i lost weight, by becomming anorexic, and being a cutter or something, it would make me feel better and erase the pain from all the years.  do I need help? or is this just thoughts running through my head? i don't know are these thoughts that will develop into something? or are they just thoughts and writing is a way to get them out of my head? all i know is that words hurt, and go straight to the heart. You need to be careful about what and how you say things to people. Because like what my mom said to me tonight. I got suicidal thoughts in my head, and she doesn't even realize she did that.    If I wrote what i felt through music would people know what i was going through? would it be to obvious? or not? i don't know but that would help. I have lots of thinking to do. Anorexia, Cutting, Suicide? is it worth it ? to get rid of the pain?
