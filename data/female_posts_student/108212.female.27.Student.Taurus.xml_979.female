Next season though, thats another story.  I use Backblog as my feedback provider.  One can post comments and add emoticons to it too!  There are extras that you can have if you pay the premium and it is easy to install just copy and paste the javascript to the body of your blog template.  Has anyone worked up some writeups for the zine? Im getting tired of seeing my mug on the top of the page =Þ
