Then i get to math, and i learn useless stuff and i find out i have a quiz tomorrow.  Then later on i have lunch, pretty normal, computer, boring, and science...samela deletes our whole lab assignment (hes a smooth one).  When i get on the bus (lys is coming home with me), she bare asses me with her jean skirt (very lovely experience lol), and when we get home we eat...very normal amounts of ritz crackers with cream cheese.  then we go online for a while, talk to sean our best friend, and have some...fun secret experiences during our get-together. Then after she leaves i do a shitload of hw, and when sue (dads gf) comes back from boston to pick up her dog, we have dinner with her and two of her daughters.  We mostly talked about how i might not go to school on friday so we can get manicures and pedicures before leaving for the BAHAMAS!! its gonna be amazzzing (btw on sat. night at 11:30 i started packing bc i got really bored..) alright i gotta go to bed, so ill talk to you guys laterrrr...
