Welll, I suppose New Years Eve has potential, but I'll probably just end up staying home reading or something. I'd almost guarantee it. Anyway...now that they're over, there's not a whole lot to do. Chris is seeing LOTR. I think I'm actually going to see that this weekend at the IMAX. That should be fun. Good times. I don't know. The problem is, I don't have my lisence yet, so I can't very well invite myself to do something.   Haha, yay for finishing this a day after i wrote it. Whoops. I don't think I'm going to bother finishing it actually. I've lost my train of thought from yesterday and I just don't really feel like finishing it to be honest. Hmmm, I wonder if it shows that I posted this now, instead of yesterday...
