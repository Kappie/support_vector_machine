But then, maybe we're only afraid of being alone because it somewhat resembles death- not being seen, heard, experienced. Who am I if not in relationship to other people? True, deep loneliness feels like there will never be anyone to interact with again, and it looks a lot like death, like grieving for oneself, for one's cessation to exist in the social world. Even for someone committed to spending time alone, such as myself, when I am happy alone it is grounded on a stable knowing that I still 'exist' to the rest of the world, I am just choosing to not interact w/it at this time.  Another manifestation of these fears, and the one that seems the most frequent and hard to describe for me, is this feeling of disappearing when among other people. I suppose, for me, being alone is where I go to define myself, is how I nurture myself, is how I know who I am, but I also love being social, love my friends, etc. When I am with others, though, I often feel like I disappear. I have conversations, even with people I love, and they seem to always be about the other person, or about the other person's experience of me, and I rarely feel like I get the chance to authentically express myself.   I guess we all see the world through our own pair of goggles- we can't help experiencing somebody else through the lens of our own Selfness- but I long for relationships where I am seen as I am, not how I am expected or hoped to be. I want to be interacted with and respected as a separate entity, not just as a character who plays out whatever storyline my partner/friends want to play out on any given day. Am I the bad guy today? The savior? The best friend? The neglectful parent? Sometimes it seems everyone decides this except me.  Perhaps it's my fault for not having a more solid identity, or for not being more outgoing or assertive. But is that it- am I doomed simply because I'm introverted, and a better listener than talker? Although there are certain parts of myself that are very solid and concrete, and certain topics I am very opinionated about, a lot of the times I feel very malleable, not fixed, and thus prone to being projected-upon.  So often I feel like I am in the process of disappearing. It is hard to explain this feeling. An example I used recently that helped was likening it to Back To The Future, where Michael J. Fox's character has these pictures where the people in them are disappearing, and at some point in the movie, he looks down and starts to see his body evaporating before his eyes. Strangely enough, this is exactly how I feel when in these situations. I feel like if I were to look down, my body would gradually be pixelating and fading away in plain sight. Perhaps energetically it is a feeling of being so enveloped/wrapped in someone else's powerful, more dominant energy field, that I literally feel like my energy is dissolving into his/hers.   And yet, this feeling of dissolving, evaporating into someone else, is so similar to the ecstatic experiences explained in so many faiths- either through sexual union, union w/god, etc, this evaporation of the self/ego is exactly the point of Life. I guess the real point, though, is for two to dissolve into a third state- 'the two become one'- or unifying w/god, or creating a third energy field unto itself- not for one to disappear due to being dominated by another.  These feelings happen mostly in conversations or daily life. I generally feel 'in control' of the trajectory of my life- I don't mean to imply by all of this that I am not an active participant in my life. I generally feel fairly empowered, like I have choices, etc. I suppose it's more in my social relationships where this becomes an issue- this deep, abiding loneliness which I can't seem to break out of. Except for when I do.
