Woke up with a sore throat and a blocked nose and my head felt rather heavy- very clear: I was going to get a cold. But I had no choice as I had  a competition to go for. I got ready and dragged my feel to the MRT station. It was one long, boring train ride to CDANS Country Club that lasted for approximately an hour. Finally I got there.  Soon it was my detail. I picked up my shooting shoes and air pistol and proceeded to my lane. I went through my shooting routine. I was shoot well. The words of my teacher rang through my head over and over again, " Let the feelings, emotions and thoughts pass. Focus on each shot. Take one shot at a time." I shot one shot after another. Each was to me a separate and individual shot. It felt good even though my nose and throat were bad- something like a bright glowing light in the middle of pitch darkness. During the shoot it felt as though I had almost complete control over my trigger and all the thoughts and emotions that ran through my head. It was an amazing feeling! And the just like that-358!  When I think about it now, I could have shot 360 only if I had not shot the 6 on my last series. It need not even have been perfect 10(bullseye). Just an 8 would have been enough for me to hit 360. But I guess the joy of hitting 360(90%) is reserved for another day someday soon- just not today.
