You know the stuffy nose and really scratchy throat kinda thing. Daniel and I babysat his sister's kids from like 10-2 and then we drove out to his house and watched some movies and just hung out the rest of the night. Not too much excitement. Yesterday I still wasn't feeling very well but Daniel and I decided to go school shopping anyway. I really wasn't in a shopping mood (amazing because when do I not like shopping?) . Anyway, I wasn't in a shopping mood so basically all I did was help Daniel shop and I didn't buy anything. He bought some new shoes and a couple shirts and stuff and we looked at a few things for me but I was just feeling lousy. So then we went back to his house and watched more movies. Daniel's friend Billy ended up coming over and staying the night. We all went in the hottub for a couple of hours and just hung out. Today I woke up STILL feeling lousy. We ate some breakfast and then we were off again to do more shopping! (Daniel had to return a few things from before) anyway, we ran into Sarah and Kayla at the mall said hi and then came back over to moms. Great fun. At 7 we're going to babysit again so Daniel's sister can go to some party. Tomarrow morning I'm heading back to dad's and I need to work some more!
