It is what life is about. It is what i plan to ask God when I meet Him (hahaha..awh GAT memory - buko babes ;D)  Talk about relief. I only have three to go. But today. My teacher approached me  said something to me. Actually I received news from three teachers. But this teacher..what He said was absolutely different?..I don't know. Don't get me wrong..it was a compliment. But I took it differently.  I really dont know. I really really don't know. This is what I was scared of. Everything going absolutely right. Putting my heart  soul into something..and even receiving positive feedback which in my opinion was genuine, or as least I hope so. But then..gah. It juss sucks! Its just so discouraging! And I don't know why Im so pessimistic (for the fact that what He said was a compliment). Maybe I am in denial. Maybe I'm only believing in what I what to think. oh shush.    And last night's thought was,   'How can you remain close to God when he seems so far away?'   THAT is really hard. But I have to trust  after all - it is His plan. And I do want to. I told you I was scared..of everything just taking a turning point. See I told you! haha oh dear.  Thank God for happy people! They are an absolute joy ;) Ian rang today even though it was his birthday - haha 'manual.' I also talked to an anonymous person today. Don't think she knows how gorgeous she is. Full of charisma, knowledge  talent. At such a little age. I ultimately have respect for you -   Happy birthday to Nikki, Jess  Ian :D  -- had better ;) --
