I got up at 6:30am and did one lesson of math. (we do school throgh the year, not as much in summer though) Then I went back to bed for 2 hours (cuz I was REALLY tired!) THan I got up and ate a early lunch *smiles* then my mom took me to get some stamps for my letters at Dillions and we got some pop and a candy bar and we went to the park. And my mom told me that we have to get rid of my puppy!! *crys*. She ahs been diggin and chewin up everything! I LOVE HER! I DON'T want to get rid of her! *CRYS SOOOOO HARD THAT MY HOUES FLOODS*!
