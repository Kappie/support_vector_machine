If they knew there was a consequence, they why didn't they take the responsibility? Why tarnish your record when you know that you are the one at fault?  Today, these questions plagued my mind. I couldn't grasp the reason why certain people had to resort to this kind of thing. And since they could have all hated me for the rest of the schoolyear if i got noisy about this, I guess it was better if I got home and wrote it down on this nifty blog instead... If they feel guilty (if ever they get to read this) then I hope that they at least finish reading the whole entry... and see why cheating is the biggest joke to play on yourself.  Okay, to start the ranting and raving (although I don' think that this being more organized would still be considered as raving @__@), I would like to ask first an essential question... "Have you ever cheated?"  Of course, the normal human being must have at least done this at least once in his lifetime. If you seem to be a different case (meaning, you've never cheated your whole life), then you deserve an award!!! But as for now, I doubt that there is anyone who has not cheated at least once in his life (and yes, copying homework, answering a question using someone else's answer and "sharing" your "blessings" is considered cheating...), but then again, you have to take into account the person's motive and his awareness on what he's doing.  But looking at it as a whole, cheating will only be considered "right" the same day that murder will be considered a moral act. Meaning... never! So, no matter the reason why you cheat, you're still doing something wrong. As for lying, there may be the so-called "white lies". Perhaps, the motive for saying "white lies" may be for a better cause, but then again... it's still called "lying". As for cheating, there may be instances when one would cheat simply to pass a subject, to get through a problem or simply just to show off that he can do it. There may be times when it would be for a "good cause" for the person concerned. But, again, it's still cheating. Therefore, it's still wrong, no matter how you look at it.  Now, let us take into consideration what I had said earlier- that cheating is the biggest joke you could play on yourself. First of all, its because cheating is irrational. Why? Okay, considering that you're taking a test, you know that a test would contain so many questions, that you'd either prepare and memorize the answers to all the questions... or not. If the choice happens to be the latter, the person usually resorts to cheating. Unless of course, he still wants to preserve his moral values. Now, let us try to remember the main reason why you even take a test... to measure how much you have learned. So, it should be understandable that when you take a test, you have learned something or at least you have understood something about the lesson. The reason why you "review" is simply to refresh the memory. Cramming then, could be one technique to study, but then, you lose the main purpose of studying... which is to learn. When you cram, your main goal is simply to pass the test. And now, we reach another irony... you end up studying blindly, when the objective of the test is to see how much you understand. Lucky for those who have good comprehension skills and a photographic memory, but for the others who lack in these, it is unsurpring to see that they end up with a disappointing result.  And so, without enough time spent in studying or understanding whatever was taken up, the student then resorts to the last option available- cheating. Let's say that the test is your only hope to pass for the whole semester, and now you're stuck between lacking the answers to the last twenty five questions and not really caring about morals anymore. If you choose to give up your own moral values, then consider that you also gave up your own self-respect. Why again? You see, when you cheat, you admit your weakness in standing up for what is right, and the same time, you admit that you are not responsible concerning your own studies... you admit your lack in mental capability. And also, you lack the responsibility and humility to accpet that you were the one at fault for not prepearing for something you knew was going to happen. Now, after the test, and after the act of cheating, you either find yourself nervous about the answers or you feel nothing at all. If you feel nervous, chances are that you're scared... either it's the first time you've done something like that, and it bothers you OR you aren't sure whether the person you copied from was even competent. But, if you feel apathetic, chances are that this wasn't the first time you've cheated, either that or you just don't care about passing anymore... Do you notice anything???... there isn't any good point in it. You gain nothing from the experience. Not matter what the reaction. Why again? Okay, for the former (feeling nervous), the reason why you are bothered is because you know that what you did was not right. In short, your conscience has not been silenced. Then, being unsure about your seatmate's answer, you are again disturbed simply because you aren't sure about what you wrote. You aren't sure of yourself, you aren't sure of the person, thus, you don't know whether what you wrote was even right at all. Now, for the latter (apathetic), now that you're used to cheating, it seems that your conscience has been silenced (or maybe, it's still there, but you pay no attention to it), but then, after cheating for so many times, can you say that you have achieved anything? Can you say that you have learned? And if you're still apathetic about that, maybe it's time that you quit school. In the first place, you're there to learn, not to copy. Copying can be done by a 1st-grader, and if you can't use enough of your brain to study, then might as well stop wasting time and money. Okay, if you're apathetic about even passing... then what's the use?  Now, let's say that it just so happnened that you aced that test. The answers you copied were right, and you passed! Of course, you feel relieved, you're glad it's over, you can finally stop worrying (of course, this doesn't apply to apathetic people). But then, is there really something to rejoice about? Can you say that those answers you wrote down were the product of your own intellect? Can you boast that you understood all those questions and answers? Can you say that the grade you got was really from your own effort? (if you can answer "yes" to that, maybe it's about time you talked to your conscience again... or maybe it's time to visit the psychiatrist) Again, you gain nothing at all. And in the end, it's an empty accomplishment. You accomplished nothing but simply learning how to imitate without thinking, how to copy without being caught... That and nothing more. And, to add, you end up spending money, time, and energy on this. Take note: your own money! You may say that it's your parents money, but think about it, it was spent for you. If they decided not to spend it on education, you could have bought something else! But, since they loved you so much and believed in your capablities so much, they decided to give you a brighter future through buying you a really expensive educational plan (or at least paying for the jaw-dropping tuition fee). And so you see, cheating is the biggest joke you can play on yourself. You may not know it, but you are deceived and the consequences of it arise later on-- when you are incapable of making up for the mistake.  Oh, and though I only discussed cheating within the academic field, I would just like to say that cheating is applicable also to the other social aspects. As they say, "once a cheater, always a cheater." But of course, that option is up to you. ^__^ What a wonderful, more meaningful world it most probably would be if everyone was honest... ...If only people were aware of this
