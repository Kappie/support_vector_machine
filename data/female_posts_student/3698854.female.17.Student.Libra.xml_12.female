I cannot school my thoughts onto that dull road of studying... i long to set my mind free to let it wander to the furthest point of the earth and beyond. Would you not rather be dancing and twirling with the starlight as your guide or be chained to a desk, weighted down with doom and dread of the forcoming exam? Yes i know i SHOULD discipline my thoughts but they bring me a somewhat brighter image, a place i would rather be than this cold, harsh world. Who am i in the world i travel to? A young girl, with wide blue eyes and a wide smile. Ah, i remember what smiling is... indeed i do... but there just hasnt been any reason to smile lately. I guess a Child of the Shadows may learn to love, but are forbidden to be happy. Happiness... a long lost illusion. I cannot remember a time when i was truly happy. A life of sorrow and tears. A childhood of having to be an adult, my adolescene as a lonely outsider trying to uncover a place in this cold harsh world for a person like me. Perhaps there is no place for me.... Banish me to the shadows. There is no place here...
