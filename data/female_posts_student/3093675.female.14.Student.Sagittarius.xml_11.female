I am a vegetarian trying to go vegan, and i believe that it is completely unnacceptable (sp?) to consume any living creature. Now, for people in 3rd world countries, who would die if they didn't eat meat and have no other way to get food, i don't like it, but they have to. But I don't live in a 3rd world country, and chances are, if you're reading this, then you don't either because you'd need a computer. I have the option to abstain from eating dead animals, and i am using that option, and so should you. These animals are brutally slaughtered, and you don't need that to happen. That's blood on your hands every time you eat a hamburger or a chicken sandwich. Think about that.   So, in closing, i shall present thee with a link to an interview that  urlLink  Peta2   did with Quinn from The Used.  urlLink  click here   for the interview.
