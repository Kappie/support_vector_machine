Though, it's not an actual college degree, since it's a 2 year program. But it'd be great for maybe after college. And it's located right in Dallas! Basically, you live and breathe acting. Not so much theatre, because it's "Career Acting" but you take a bunch of technique classes involving voice and movement. And then a bunch of history on acting. So that's definitely a possibility for me.   I also got my information stuff for camp...I'm not allowed to bring my cell :( What am I going to do for 3 days without it?   Looks like I have a pretty busy summer. Going to Nebraska next week, then the week I get back I'm going on that tour of KD Studios. Then it's off to Tennessee the following Monday and stay a week there. Then after that I have to go to North Star Camp from July 25-28. And then I have to get senior pictures. After that, summer drill starts August 2-6. Then a bunch of back to school stuff for the North Stars. And finally school starts August 17th. Hopefully my David will be able to visit one week in August :)   Don't stop the love for anything I'll do everything I am into you
