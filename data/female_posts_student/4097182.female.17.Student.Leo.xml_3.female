I reached home at.... guess wad? 4 am! n my dad sent me home... Btw, i went for e countdown for national day on 8/8/04 wif lilian,  yan fen, lai yong (n his frenz...), tai liang, raymond n fu wei...(n supposedly to be wif machi, mindy, wei ding n yong jun, but we decided to go separately after we met)    Though it was a pity we didn't get to c e concert, it was still fun... We walked a GREAT deal tt nite, n my blisters burst... so tai liang piggybagged me for a short distance back to shaw towers... After tt, we stayed in e maintenance office for ard 2 hrs before we proceeded to haf supper @ geylang...    Yah, i noe its not very nice for gers to go there esp late in e nite, but i wasn't doing anything immoral.... Besides there were both guys n gers mah... wadz e whole big deal???    Anyway, my dad's reaction was... "y go geylang? Dun u noe its a poultry farm?" but he didn't say much after tt... My mum, on e other hand, went ad telling ppl in e stupid temple tt i went geylang for supper n those UNCLES started giving me lectures on "y gers shldn't be there"     C'mon! its food paradise in geylang, n i mean EDIBLE food... Anyway, i intend to go n explore again in future... dunno when though, but most prob wif e same grp of ppl...     SSHHHH.... dun let others noe hor...
