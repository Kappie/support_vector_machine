I have a C in his class and I still have 4 test grades left. Skills test, Test #7, and the final is worth 2 test grades, and they all have to be done by tomorrow. My tests grades are 51, 56, 83, 86,  93, which is a 73.8 average. I hate math so much. Tonight is totally dedicated to Studying math, so is Study Hall tomorrow, and part of language, and lunch. Then it's PE  Math! I've been gone for so long and when I got back the teachers I eneded to talk to were gone, Interesting eh? So now it's Tuesday and block day is tomorrow, lab due on Thursday.
