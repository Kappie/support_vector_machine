All I can hear is the constant yelling in my head. Yelling for me to make up my mind. Make a choice. Choose the murder weapon, time and date. And the victim. Oh if only it could be me. "The fewer sacrafices the better... right?" Yeah. Kill two birds with one stone. Stop two hearts with one bullet.  I find it hard to think straight anymore. I have no idea why these thoughts are running through my head. I need to make a choice.
