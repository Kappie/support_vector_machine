So here's yet again...another itenerary...can't promise that that will be fulfilled...see below for a prime example...  But wait before you see below see this below...the list: 1) Review of the school play 2) My "quote of the day" for today 3) Last night's ep. of HM 4) Recent anxieties and/or annoyances 5) Writing pieces  You may not know what some of the things are on the list but I sure will remember what they are when I see that list.  To homework I go a-running! Too bad I can't go a-running  away .
