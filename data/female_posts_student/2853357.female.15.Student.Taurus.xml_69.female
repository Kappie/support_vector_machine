About half way through the swimming and stuff there was an... err... accident.  My little cousin suddenly had the urge to go in the pool... and no, not turn the water yellow. Thankfully, I had decided that I didn't want to go swimming because I went swimming 2 days before with my other cousins.  It was pretty damn boring.  So now, they're all over at my house (the liliputians). Ryan's got them hooked with the GC right now.  (*thinking: camera...*)   I've eaten SO much today, I'm feeling pretty blah just sitting at my computer. (And come on, what was I supposed to do for like 4 hours with all these kids running around giggling like theyre drunk?)  (*thinking: hmm... that would have been a good idea*)    I haven't been able to write for a while, and it's KILLING ME. And I've only gotten 3 reviews... one from a former reader. YAY! (conincidently, the person's pen name's 'faithful'... but it's the first time I've heard from the person in several months...)  Oh, did I tell you [people] that ryan got kicked off/banned from ff.net?  (*LITTERALLY FALLS OVER LAUGHING*)  He didn't follow guidelines or something or other. Thought that was HALARIOUS!  Qué más?   Omg, Jennifer is driving me insane. She's in that giggly barbie stage thing... she's the ultimate girly girl. You know... pink night dresses with those fake plastic dress up shoes and her room's covered in purple and she's got all this make up already... The damn girl is seven. Jeez, and I don't even wear make up... Who the hell is SHE trying to impress? Kinda makes me wanna chuck her through the window.  I can hear them fawning over Isabelle downstairs. I better go check it out. (Mom does this weird Filipino thing like Mz. Welsh used to do...  *cringes*  Mz. Welsh makes it popular while my mother makes it sickening...)  Later,  Patty
