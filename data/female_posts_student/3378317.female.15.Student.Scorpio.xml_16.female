Life goes on No matter if your life is tattered And you can't fix what went wrong Life goes on Your battered and your life is scattered You're a hook in your own theme song Life goes on You're a fighter but the grip is tighter And you know that you can't stand long Life goes on Yours only gets brighter Life goes on Yours only gets brighter Life goes on  - Pigeon John  Abstract Rude  yeaa..  hit me up when all tha frustration mellows down. for now, who knows whats going to happen.  i wanna see you but then i dont because then i will have to say bye for a while.  i dont know.    feel like im on auto-pilot.  out.  something close to how i feel:  The walls in this room are slowly closing in, like a slowly working punishment for an unspoken sin. I came to my bed at just after eleven, but last time I checked, it was almost seven. The sun is newly shining but it seems very late. Is there some reason I've been so cursed by fate? Every night I just wish that I could drift off to dream, waiting expectantly until the alarm starts to scream. I'm weak and exhausted but carry on nonetheless. It feels like it's killing me and it's hard, I confess. Every day I face a Battle, another total emotional drain. Constantly, I'm being criticized and told that I'm to blame. I'd give so much to sleep in peace even for just one night. Nobody seems to understand that every night is a harder fight.  peace.
