It had these true or false questions that I don't think I did very good at. I went to ASB. It was..ASB. Yeahh. Then I went home and made some noodles. Then I went to CYT. It was quite boring. There was only four people there...all girls. So we just talked and painted our nails, fun but a waste of time.  Then I went to the rehersal. Yuck! I walked around with this girl named Eliza who is an exchange student from Brazil. She is cool. But i REALLLY needed to study because today I am going to FAIL two quizzes in two classes. So I never got to study. I am in a horrible mood.  *sigh*   Today is a bad hair day and a "nothing good about me day"  I woke up at 5:30 then I just did homework all morning so I haven't had time to take a shower or anything. Oh well, it doesn't really matter what I lok like at schoool. Yuck. I am a nervous wreck.   Thank God its the weekend.  Goals for this weekend: Study Spanish Write great expectations character anylis clean room be in contact with Mr. Hotness at the play Don't slack of See sunshine at church  Get closer to God Wrap Matt's present (his birthday is tomorrow!)  I think thats about it..  OOH! wait...this oen is most important... GET BETTER GRADES!!!   Gosh,  hate school.   I hate every little thing about it.   I am such a mess.  I better go study.  Love, Laura
