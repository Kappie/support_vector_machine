One such example is AT, which the New York Times ran an article on titled "Yet Again, a Brand Name Loses Its Magic". The piece details how AT and other brand names such as Polaroid, TWA, PanAm, and other major brand name companies have falter recently once they got to the top. The  Times  says that the companies fail because they often become complacent once they reach the top. One small, but interesting point that the  Times  makes is about the advertising of brand name companies. They note that:    AT may have cut back on marketing just when it needed to bolster its image the most. Last year, with its share of the market a fraction of what it had been even after the breakup, ATT spent an estimated $312.6 million to advertise in United States major media, compared with $427.8 million in 1998, according to TNS Media Intelligence/CMR, part of Taylor Nelson Sofres.   AT decided that it was not important to market their brand, that they were already a household name, and that it was a good way to cut costs. This approach seems to be the incorrect one. For example, the author of the article notes that Apple has become successful in recent years by marketing itself as "cool", especially with its iPod. With this new marketing strategy Apple has been able to make huge amounts of money. This shows that a large company, no matter how important still should advertise. But, can a large conglomerate company that has almost all the market remain "cool" in the eyes of buyers for long? That is one of the most important questions for large companies today.
