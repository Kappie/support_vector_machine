Err, ahem, Forgive my utter lack of manners or inhibitions, it is a trait that I have lovingly developed during my last year of high school. Although it's far from complete, it's probably best that I leave it that way. I can honestly say that I can honestly say just about anything, especially on something so intimate/impersonal as an internet post.    My first post is destine to contain very little substance. I don't really want to seem like an Ashley, so I'll leave out as much of my self-depreciating rants as humanly possible.     I'm heading to Braleigh's house now, to hang out with a few friends, and hopefully not get sick, like I seem to have a knack for doing when it's time to do something fun.     Now for the big question... Who do I share these thoughts with... I would feel pretty horrible if all of a sudden, I had a hankering to rant about something, and have the subject of that hankering read it... *Long sigh* Well, I guess if you're reading this, I'll have to muffle those rants. Haha! Not that I'd rant about YOU!!!
