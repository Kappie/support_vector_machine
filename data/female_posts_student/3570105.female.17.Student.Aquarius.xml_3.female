In he waltzes with his ideals on relationships n compromise..throwing my ideals out the door...dress like that u look like a slut...dont drink its a sign of weak character in a girl..talk decently..ditch the sarcasm..ohmahfahkingawd. it leads to many questions..too many questions...i need prozzac or i need alcohol....
