I think they need to have a kids day because we have to put up with the crap or parents tell us to do. No offense Mrs. Cunningham! But truthfuly I think that parents put to much strain on a childs head. Yeah right.Anyway. I don't know aboutyou guys but my parents tell me what to do to much. Do they tell you what to do all the time. anyway I am going way off the topic here. So. I reall yam not doing anything. I will have to deal with my grandparents but you really don't want to get me into that. My grandparents are anything but enjoyable to be around. My grandfather bosses my grandmother around and she does it. He sits in a chair all day and orders everone else to do everything for him. When he comes to my house he kicks us out of the chairs that we are sitting in because he wants to sit in it. He also takes over the tv because "he is the guest he can do what ever he wants." Bull you just don't change the chanel unless you have permission from both adults because soemtimes the parents put the TV on to keep the kids occupied. I just want to slap him. bUt I know that I can't. But do you guys have anything interesting that your doing for fathers day?
