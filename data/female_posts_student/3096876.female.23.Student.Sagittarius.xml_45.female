Celebrities are far more cracked out than we give them credit; whatever probs I've got with NO-money, they've got worse with PLENTY-O-money; gossip column writers should be award-winning fictionaires.  And I read the whole thing from the comfort of my own bed.  Luckily not because I was bed-ridden, but because I just didn't want to leave the sunny comfort of my room.  My surgery, thank Allah, Buddha and Ganesh, went just fine.  There were some tense moments, ie: in the five minutes before I was to head into the OR, they still didn't have a bed to slice  dice me on, and there was also a little bit of confusion as to whether this would be a local anaesthetic, or a general.  "LOCAL???  I don't think so."  I asked the nurse if she might check my chart once more.  "Oh yes, here it is.  You're to go under general anaesthetic."  Damn skippy I am.  But I woke up with minimal pain (accepted a shot of morphine in the ass, just for good measure,) and went home without incident.  Here's the part that made the day so banner...  In the few days before my procedure, not surprisingly, I felt brutally alone and depressed.  Then on Sunday afternoon, Anil showed up.  We spent the afternoon together, hung out with Mattee and burned a couple joints down in bee-utiful Lyons Valley, kicked the soccer ball around for a bit, had dinner at Lick's (ah, memories...), and just generally had a laugh.  Monday morning, Brent showed up at about 10am.  He stayed with me and even drove me to the hospital.  I gotta say, I was a little shocked that he showed up, but also a little relieved since I was  hoping  he would.  He even came by afterwards to see how I was doing.  Sure, his annoyingly chirpy cell phone dragged him away not long after he showed up, but the fact that he made the trip said enough.  "I'd still do anything for you," he told me.  Thanks B, you don't know how much that means.  I had an out-pouring, literally, of support from my friends.  A ridiculously long-distance call from Bridge, a heart-warmingly supportive and funny message left from my QueenMo, and many others.  But B walked me right to the mouth of the lion's den, holding my hand the whole way.  At least in the break-up we haven't lost sight of the feelings that  weren't  hurt.  And now it's all over with.  I don't have any more nasty surgery to dread (I hope), just a couple of years of cuddling-sessions with my specialist.  Not to go ahead bashing when this post has been so positive, but one of the things that the break-up did was show me who I've got.  When I was with Brent, the tunnel-vision was totally detrimental to almost every other relationship I had.  I ignored so many of my friends because I was with B so much of the time.  Something that I came to resent quite a bit.  But now I'm on my own, so to speak, with absolutely no reason to feel lonely.  TO MY FRIENDS,  THANK YOU .  I LOVE YOU, I'M LUCKY TO HAVE YOU, I'M GLAD YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I NEED YOU.
