I like the new blogger design, too- a little Gap, but streamlined, sharp. Last time I tried to sign up for one, I was put off. I am easily put off by things with bad design.  This is me procrastinating when I should be studying for a final exam. This is me wasting time online when I have more 'important' things to do. Whoever invented the internet must have been the world's most committed procrastinator. I wonder what s/he should have been doing when s/he invented the internet instead. I wonder how many wonderful inventions/works of art/science/etc have been created in the name of avoiding other more 'important' activities. Funny how the stuff that is so 'important' to daily life isn't the stuff that matters in 100 years, isn't the stuff with real staying power. Like, for instance, the laundry is a pressing concern right now, but isn't likely going to be the thing that lives on in the memory of generations to come. Such it is.
