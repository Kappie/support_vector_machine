We watched The Exorcist. Yeah, I really don't understand why my mom said I couldn't see that movie. It wasn't scary at all. A little weird, but I didn't see the big deal to it. Oh well. After Marty's house, i went to Holli's house. It was the weirdest thing! I was talking to Holli and I stuck my hand in my back pocket and I felt a little piece of paper from a gum wrapper. I take it out and unfold it, and I notice there is a phone number written on it. I can't remember whose number it is, or why the hell it is in my pocket, so Holli suggested I call it.  Wanting to solve the mystery, I decide to do just that. Out of all the people whose number it could be, it turned out to be Josh! Isn't that crazy? I thought it was really weird. I have no idea why the hell his number was in my back pocket. It makes no sense to me. It was really weird. Oh well. Me and Holli also called Harley and talked to him for a bit. I haven't talked to him in a long time, so it was nice. He should be coming home late this summer. I miss him. Oh well. This summer I may get a job working at a mortgage company, helping to do office work. I'm not too sure yet tho. Hmm...well that was the extent of my weekend so far. My grandparents are over right now because they are going to eat dinner over. So my plan is to be on the computer so I don't have to talk to them too much. They are kind of boring. Oh well. I'll be sorry I didn't spend enough time with them once they die. Awful, but true.
