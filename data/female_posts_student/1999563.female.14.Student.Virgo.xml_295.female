Well, let me put it this way.  I am going to break my day into different parts rating each part ona scale of 1-10 (10 best.)  Morning: 3, I turned off my alarm clock in my sleep so I had to take a shower late which then resulted in: A.Matt being mad B. Hannah being mad C. Being late for being early. English: 4, got in trouble had to be moved by danielle (he is a guy..i think I spelled that wrong) But its okay cuz we just talk about guitars and switchfoot the whole time. Poster dude, about a stinking word. And you know what word I got? Succumb!!! Hahha Science: 2 Way to much homework for my own good. Spanish: 5.7 Forgot to do my homework. But then I read Inge's YM magazine and got to make fun of "hot" guys for the rest of the period. *coughhh* CHAD MICHAEL MURRY! "Hillary duff and I are just friends!!" WA History: 4 I finished my project but I had to stay after to fix somethings with the printer then resulting in being late for lunch. LUNCH! 9.5 That was SOOOO much fun. I have NEVER laughed that hard in my whole life. Hahahah. Sara, Caitling, Taloy- you know why ;) Then that pretending to be fairies in the b-room. Hahha Math: 3 Yuck tastic. yeah...but I got to look at beau's guitar magazine and it had the music for Meant to live!!!!! (s-foot)  (home..) 8,So I was gonna buy that magazine at voice lessons but the teacher called and was like "I can't do your lesson today" So I was like YAYYYY so I went on amazon and bought the book that has ALL the beautiful letdown songs for guitar on it! YIPEE! 3-7 days ;) I don't think I can wait that long.  CYT: 3 it was bad. So I am in this improv callss and you kind of have to be funny, but I wasn't funny. I suciked so bad. It was horrible horrible horiblle. I kept messing everything up. :(  Piano: -2 WORSE! I have to have this song memorized and because I am stupid I didn't memorize it so she yelled. High point: I get to quit at the end of MARCH! EE!! Now I  can just play guitar all night and day! Whoopee!  Home: My sister made me turn off switchfoot!! :(
