But I'm seriously very excited because I heard from a very reliable source (ok, I saw it in HMV) that there's a Meatloaf DVD full of concert footage, songs, and much much more! Eeeee! I sound like a really bad shopping channel spokesperson. I've decided that that is my future ambition... Shopping channel spokesperson. I'm sure that for someone who's failing math, that is the proper career choice. Yes. And I've done it again.
