HAPPY BIRTHDAY!   shit.  first, on friday, i had no money for a yearbook.  i was really upset that day anyway, but when i remembered that yearbooks were being handed out, i was really really upset.  so i frantically called my mom 5 times within a half hour, only actually reaching her ONCE.  so she came with the checkbook, yelling at me while we were walking toward the gym, and we walk in.  all of a sudden, my two best friends turn around and hand me a yearbook.  i pretty much died right there.  well, not really.  i just cried my eyes out.  i couldn't believe it!  they spent  $40  on that for me!  i couldn't believe it.  yeah.  after that, my mom was not very happy with me...for a while at least.  things got better as the night went on after our short and emotional quarrel after school.  i think we both needed to say what we did.  oh, and the korean boy gave me a gift that i was not to open until the next day.  a bit creepy when he handed it to me, i guess.  it gets worse.  okay.  saturday.  right after midnight.  i open korean boy's present.  it's a $150 minidsic player.  i was more shocked than happy.  a little dreadful, in fact.  he has it bad for me.  but i perceive us only to be friends.  later in the day i confronted him about it (told him that i could not keep it because of its monetary value and the occasion and our relationship status, etc.) and he wouldn't take it back.  this is messy, and probably going to get worse.  i dunno yet. anyway, at a decent time in the morning, i got up and ate breakfast that my mom cooked for me (accompanied by her favorite '50s music) and opened presents.  enjoyable!  then we sat around for a while and did nothing (well, i was actually admiring my gifts) and then i showered and my mom and i went to sheboygan for food for the family party yesterday.  we also went to tj maxx, where she also bought me a cute late '50s-style party dress and a nice pair of white cropped pants.  and then she bought me some sushi for lunch!!!  we got home, and her friend from chicago sent some flowers for me (even after saying in our phone convo earlier that she had something else for me).  so sweet!  then we went to church and at the end, she made the whole congregation sing for me.  after church, i was invited to my best friend's house to  "hang out" , but had to be late because of the talk with korean boy.  so, after that fiasco, i went home to change and went over to my friend's house.  that little  "hang out"  time with her ended up being a   SURPRISE PARTY   (!!!!!!!!!!!) with all of my closest friends.  IT WAS SPLENDIFOROUS!  i had no clue that they would plan something like this...it was the greatest b-day ever.  i was there 'til after midnight.  all that while, my parents were toiling in the kitchen for the next day's big meal.  sunday:  got up, finished cleaning, working, etc.  and got ready for the lunch with my family.  lunch was enjoyable, well-tasting, and fun.  my parents surprised me with an original copy of "David Bowie and the Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars" and a MANDOLIN!!!!!!!!!!!  i'd wanted a mandolin for sooooo long...gosh.  it's so much fun to play!  i probably annoyed the heck out of my family!    today i had to go and play for band for the memorial day celebration (no parade this year--too much rain!) and then i went to my brother's boy scout troop leader's house for a while.  the low point of the weekend.  then i got home and was bored for a little while until my friends who planned the party came over.  we had fun just being stupid and playing guitar.  they like john mayer, and i taught them a chord that he uses often.  they spazzed over that.  it was funny!  my little sister drew a pic of my friend...and even drew on the zits.  what a little chump.  god.  i felt so bad about that.  but it was funny.  good weekend.  this is the happiest i've been in a very, very long time.
