First impressions of me are usually bad and then people don't like me just because I'm "shy" or "rude" or "bitchy" or "inconsiderate". I'M SORRY I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO ACT WHEN I FIRST MEET SOMEONE OK?! I don't understand how anyone can form an opinion about me unless they talk to me. I'm not a bad person. I can't be mean to anyone unless I'm pushed to be. So why don't people like me? Why do they think I'm a bad person? I would never intentionally do anything to hurt anyone, even if I hate them. If you just sat down and had a conversation with me then you would understand where I'm coming from and maybe even like me. I just hate how people don't like me and think I'm a bad person when they don't even talk to me. I'm sorry but is it a crime that I don't want to be like everyone else? Is it bad that I'm different?  I know what people think of me. I'm not dumb or blind, I see how people look at me. They think:   "OMG look at that Kelly girl, she wears black that means she's goth."   No, I'm not. I wear black sometimes. Oh My God that's a crime and I should be hated for it. Or,   "Kelly tries to hard to be what she's not, a punk."   Well, I don't label myself or anyone. I don't consider myself goth, punk, prep, or anything. I am who I want to be. Or then theres,   "Kelly's a bitch because she (insert something bitchy here)."   Well, I'm sorry but I just don't know how to talk to some people ok? If I don't talk to you it's not because I'm a bitch. I think my friends would tell you that I'm not. I don't talk to some people because they either intimadate me, or I don't know them and am to shy to talk to them. And you can't forget the   "Oh Kelly? Yeah I talk to her sometimes and she's pretty cool, but I don't consider her my friend and would never hang out with her outside of school."   Well, all I have to say to that is, I don't care what anyone thinks of me. I am who I am and noone is going to change me. If you get to know me and don't like me then ok, don't talk to me anymore. But if you judge me before you get to know me then you are just like everyone else and that is boring.  Well, on to other things. Today I have dinner dance at the Hulbert House in Boonville at 5. Go if you love me! It's $15 by the way. Before dinner dance I'll just be finishing my AP project and just hanging out around here. Oh how fun. Not really.  Listening to: [Worst December by Sugarcult]  It’s a big mistake 50 days, 3 months away I’d be laughing today But your voice on the phone gives me no reason  Don’t take from me My heart is barely beating Don’t take from me I’m falling down  All I want to do is lie in bed with you All I really ever need is you All I got to do is give up all I have to be with you  It’s a different day 1500 miles away Why would you want to stay? So take a look around  All I want to do is lie in bed with you All I really ever need is you All I got to do is give up all I have to be with you  All I want to do is to be close to you All I want to do is to be next to you All I want is you to give up all we had to be I can’t remember why I’m here If you’d let me spend my life with you  December’s gone It came and went  All I really need is you I’m waiting here for you December’s gone It came and went
