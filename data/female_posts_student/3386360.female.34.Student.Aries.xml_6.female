If I wouldnt have woke the whole house i would have gotten up and started cleaning or something. I dont know what it was. I flittered around tossed and turned and finally got back to sleep but I still woke up with the jitters. I dont know maybe it's because I have the phone bill to pay today, I always stress during bill paying due to money issues. Maybe that was the problem. Ether way I am going to finish writing this and talking to DK (The MP friend of mine who is helping down the road) and then clean the livingroom from the night before mess. The joys of going to bed before anyone else means I get to clean te mess up from the night before after I go to bed that everyone makes Lol. Still no e mail from AC but I hold out hope and faith. Today I have to get the school work for J due to his suspension. Tomorrow is the conference to get him back to school. I will be so glad when this school year is over and he is out of that school. T. is having trouble adjusting to things right now I think mainly due to Ricky's death. My heart goes to him because he is seriously struggling. If I had the chance / money I would take him and J back to California for a short visit maybe it would open the gates to his memory but then I am scared of what it would do. I know it could only help but as a mother I want to protect him. But no sense in saying "what if". I had a day dream today. I was looking at dresses (started out looking at skirts and then I went into dresses) and I saw this beautiful dress (saved in favorites)and the first thing I thought of was "beautiful simple garden wedding" oh gosh am I bad. Of course then my mind went in a weird direction (as is the norm with me as of late) AC comes down and we hit it off (this part of the dream is the same) and we head off down to California to visit with my sister, we swing in to visit all the family and I show him parts of where I grew up. Then onto the normal fantasy of Vegas and a quick wedding. I know I am silly but the fantasy is sweet. Ok well I am going to call my sister, clean up the livingroom and maybe catch a nap. I might write more later I dont know ether way I love you AC and you are here with me in spirit until you can get back here in person.
