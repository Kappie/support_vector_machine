Comm. and we had to choose a song and take or find pictures that best describe it. I did "Celebrity Skin" by Hole (you guys all knew that anyway...) and It was sooooo fucking awesome. My teacher love it. I know it's really vain, but I love it! Oh and theres gonna be a "rumble" tonight. Give you details on the out come later! BTW- there is gonna be footage of it too, we are gonna try to upload it to kaza!
