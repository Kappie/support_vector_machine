Everytime I looked at her I just started laughing because it was so unreal. The whole thing felt like a fake reailty. Every time Ilooked at her I was like "Wow.," She is quite wow worthy. Firt of all she is the most beautiful, friendly, funny, person EVER. I love her! Gosh. It seemed so weird. I was finally like right next to this person i had talked to for like 2 years. There she was. It was crazyyy. Schnarlififc. ;)   Tomorrow I AM GOING TO YOUTH GROUP. MWa ahahahaahahahha. It shall be QUITE amusing. Mwa ha.  BTW. Mandy has the coolest family EVER. They are so funny and friendly...and YEAH. I love them all to death. GOSH I am still amazed. They are WONDERFUL.  But it was weird.  Because while I was around her I just could never think of anything to say. It kinda felt like I had already told her everything there ever was to say. I shall thinkof things to say tomorrow.
