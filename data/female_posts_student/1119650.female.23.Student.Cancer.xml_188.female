We're often scared to let those people in our "real" lives close to us, we shy away, put up fronts on dates and at work and never REALLY let people in.  Yet here, in our little blogging community we (well me in particular) divulge some of the most intimate details of our personal lives that complete strangers can read and give us feed back on.  Perhaps its theraputic as we're getting a semi-objective opinion on many situations, but in a way that seems so strange to me.  Why is it that the anonymity (depending on how much of yourself you put out there) of the internet allows us to let people into our lives easier?  Is it less scary to face human interaction when its only in print?  Some people make the same crass, asshole comments that they would normally make, yet does it seem to bother you less because you don't knwo them?    Furthermore, I've been turned onto this whole "blogging lifestyle" because each new blog I discover shows me another personality, another life, another person putting themselves out there and feeds some bizzare voyeuristic side to me that I never knew existed.  Am I soon to be a peeping tom??  Aside from those listed in my sidebar, I've stumbled upon some really great blogs through clicking links in links in links...and so on.  Here's a list of a few that I love to read.  (They'll go in my sidebar soon enough so I don't have to remember how to click through to them.)   urlLink Cheeks    urlLink Amy Choppa    urlLink Attorneys Suck...or IA (Im not sure)    urlLink Mo (A Cracked Southern Belle)    urlLink Fat Free Milk    urlLink Cacoa Pulp
