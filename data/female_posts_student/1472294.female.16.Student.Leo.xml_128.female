What is worst is that I realised that my school's so- called E- learning portal has recorded my website as I had put in my e- mail. ShIt! I am dead. If ANYBODY inocently clicked to either me or another classmate's website (there are only 2 of us with websites), I am as good as a dead chicken. (;-_-;) I think I have to change the website. Hiazzz.... Oh, can somebody pray for me that I will prevent myself from falling asleep during ES? It will be very tiring and I hate photo- taking session....
