Last night was also the worst night of my life. I got into 2 fights with friends today. I bitched out another friend. I betrayed someone's trust. I tried to steal $500, but thought better of it.  So all in all, my day pretty much sucked. And the worst part is I made everything so much worse by yelling and complaining to ppl about it. Right now I really Have no one to talk. I really want to make amends, but their are so many fucked up things right now, I don't even know where to begin. Maybe I should just start with the truth, even though that one will be the hardest ever...  Hopefully I'll get back online after work and will be able to hash out a few of my friendship glitches...  Later,  ~Ani
