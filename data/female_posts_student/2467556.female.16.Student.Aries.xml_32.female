Brittany had the golf thing going on and was making all these hole in ones and then me and Jess were all playing hockey with our golf balls until they got into the hole.  I made mine skip out of the mini golf thing several times.  The lady there was sooo mean to us, she cheated us out of 2 more games and made us pay more for our glowy necklaces.  Argh.  Then there was this REALLY WEIRD guy at the fajita place that was all hitting on me and Jess.  it was weird.  I thought the reason he talked really slow and had a weird accent was because he was foreign......no it turns out he's from Arkansas.  I should've known.    Sports update: Stars win over Vancouver (a frickin 9:30 game) 3-2.  It was awesome, Niko and Antti rocked the house.  I watched some of the Colorado game before the Stars game and Paul Kariya was sooo cute! He's so little!!!  Now its time for the friend story of the week!  Sarah Casey  Yeah so we met over the internet because she was a friend of my friend, Haniya.  She was also dating Harper Weaver at the time which i thought was REALLY ODD.  We always talked about Harper etc and for the longest time i thought she was a year younger than i was.  i remember this one time, Harper wanted to send her flowers while she was on vacation in washington or something......and i spent hours researching and helping harper.....and then he got her a TEDDY BEAR!!!  Oh well, good times.  Me and Sarah officially met at the PSAT (we're such nerds!) where i was so tired from staying up until like 4am at a friend's house, that i was completely out of it.  I remember it was our break during the PSAT and i was staring at the school song on the opposite wall.  Then i started asking myself and Sarah, if our school was really on a lofty hilltop.  Sarah thought that this was just the funniest thing ever.  lalalala we became good friends.  We ended up having geography together second tri which was like the best tri EVER.  We had sooo many jokes in that class and most of them were rather inappropriate.  if i tried to list them all, it would take weeks.  Most of them were about Finland, Masengill, Hockey, newsboys.......and generally everything else.  Can i just say D lunch 2nd tri!?!?!  i can just say that Sarah was the person that cheered me up when things got really down.....usually with something really dumb that would make me laugh.  She was also sort of the voice of reason whenever my pessimistic side came out.  I love Sarah to death and she's always been there for me when i needed her most and she always listens to my dramatic and embarassing stories.  Baptist-palooza!!!! LOL!!!  We always joke around about who we're going to marry which generally ends up in insanity......yeah.  i love my Captain Casey!!!!!!!    Go Stars....even though we're losing as i write this.....  Love,  ~~~Taylor~~~
