I wish we did  not have to leave this early, and I could sleep longer.  I'm still trying to get the hang of this...telling my ideas and feelings on a computer..this is new to me.  It feels kinda funny...that's ok though I'll get used  to this.  I guess eventually I'll make an about me page or something.  Not that anyone would want to read this blog of my boring life..=)
