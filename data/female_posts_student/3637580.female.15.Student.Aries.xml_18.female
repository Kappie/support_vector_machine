I mean COME ON who wouldn't wanna get up every morning at 6 AM (yes that is the morning) and get to soccer at promtley seven and then run like 5 miles or sprint the whole morning. Tuesday is when it started to get bad, We ran about 4 or 5 miles I think. It was tough. We also did alot of ab work, which didn't seem so bad intill I tried to get out of bed this morning...sore muscles really suck. Today was better though, we did sprints(diagonals) which hurt after about the 6th one but those aren't nearly as bad for me as distance. Mandy lined us up for ladders, and all of us were so tired from the sprints we just finished, She looked at us and then said Fuck this we're going to Studebagels, that was awesome by far. We came back and scrimaged with the boys. Haha it's funny to think the last time I scrimaged with the boys team was last year when I broke my arm. That fucking sucked. But I'm really glad I decided to get off my ass and get back into soccer. I really didn't have an excuse last year, cause my arm was better by the time conditioning started in the summer, I just knew no one at all so I didn't go, I guess you could say I was scared. Well that and laziness played a factor in it to. Even though we only did sprints and perimeter today my muscles are killing me, I feel like someone kicked my ass 3 times. OuCh!  Ohh so as for Lauren's party this past weekend, It turned out to be really awesome. It was Lauren, Lucy, Lindsey, Lesley, Kristen, Sarah and myself. We went Tubing like 20 times and we Jet skied a couple times too. Lindsey, Lauren, and me water skied also. We all got along really well and there were no fights or anything. I love LoLo she's such a sweetie! And off the subject but I can't WAIT till she gets her car! haha Lindsey and me decided were buying her a taxi light to stick on the top of her car..ok not really but we are for sure riding around in her 13 year old Ford Taurus with style. I mean come on the boa in the back window, the seat belt covers and the air freshener COMPLIMENTS of ME, and the fuzzy stearing wheel, it will be hot for sure, in a cheesy 80's type of way haha..  I have more to say but it's 10 in the morning I REALLY need a shower and then I think I'll sleep for a while. LaTeR...As Bigs (Simone) always says...Holler
