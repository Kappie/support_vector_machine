But I am sure I'll feel better tomrrow. I applied for 15 Jobs this mourning, hopefully one will call me back.  Watched the movie the Butterfly effect. I thought the director's cut was really amazing.  Still waiting to see the Secret Window, with Johnny Depp, and I want to go the movie theater and see The Notebook, I read like half the book a couple of years ago. It was ok, what I remeber of it anyway. I am most definately ready for a little romance movie.
