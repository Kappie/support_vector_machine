I'm like most of these bloggers because NO ONE reads this! It's kind of weird, but I feel like I'm keeping a record for myself of what I think is interesting on this blog, and on the other I record my personal drama. Lately I've been more verbose in the confessional, mostly because I've been going through more drama and spending less time being transfixed by world events. Next week should be light all around because it's PAPER TIME!! Yay. :(
