Got back choir practice at 9:30, and was able to sing Sana'y Wala Ng Wakas through the midi that i downloaded from the net. To everyone who helped me in trying to find the notes or the chords of the song, thanks!!!  Anyway, Father Dennis and Father Edgar called up...just to tell me they're leaving for Hawaii...hmmm...i bet in an hour they'd be there and will probably be exchanging "aloha's" with Father Hiwi.  Not much to say for today...oh well, there's always tomorrow.
