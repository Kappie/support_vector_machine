It was bizarre and we had to like "vanquish" this thing that we called gollum, but it so wasn't him, so we were like chasing him... in an elevator. It was weird there was more to the dream but thats the only part i can remember. The whole Charmed theme is kinda random to because i haven't watched that show in like a year. hmmm.
