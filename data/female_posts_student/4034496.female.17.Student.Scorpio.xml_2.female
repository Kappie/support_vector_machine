It would be so much easier if I lived on my own. I'm only 17. Thankfully mom and dad andbrother left last friday for the weekend, so norm came over on Fri night, we rented  Eurotrip.  I wished he could've slept over, but I forgot to ask him, so it wasn't arranged. So instead we just fooled around, he ate me out, i gave him head. We havn't had sex yet. I think this weekend it'll happen. Mom, Dad and brother are going to Montreal for a week for vacation. I can't go because of my stupid job.       Norm has no post-secondary education. He makes $400 a day as an electrician with Hydro1, but still, no education? "Preposterous," says Dad. "Absolutely outlandish!" says Mom. I don't really care, as long as he doesn't get all pissy when I dump him for some fancy shmancy pre-med student, whom I will inevitably marry.       I'm 17. I have had sex twice, with two different people. Is that slutty?      From the outside I have the perfect life. Iexcelled in school, wasvery extra-curricularily involved, have professional parents, both of whom have treatedeachother and mewith nothing but love and respect, and volunteer at 3 different places. My friend's throught the years have always bugged me that I have a picture-perfect family, I think it's got it's problems, but is probably about as close as you can get....so why am I so different?       Of course, no one understands the way I think. Because I keep it in my head. I recently got a job as a telemarketer for a large firm. On the second day of the job I was the top seller. Now, a week into the job, I have been promoted. Why? because from the moment a conversation i open with someone, i conform to whatever they want me to be. Thats why everyone likes me. I feel like i have no identity. I have taught myself how to be someone else so well that I've lost who I truely am.       Am I what is known as a "closet slut?" 2 months ago I got my right nipple pierced. I figured it's edgy enough for the guys to go wild, but not aseverlasting as a tattoo.    P.S. My english teacher would go nuts, this entry defies everything I have learned in 4 years of University level high school english.
