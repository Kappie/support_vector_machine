I haven’t spoken with him in a few days I have to admit that I am not too worried but I do miss him a lot. Soon my friend Danielle Barber’s Husband David will be coming home on his two-week leave. I know that Danielle must be very excited but upon his return I am also reminded about how the ARMY screwed Jesse out of his R request and how he will not be coming home in July. I am very angry because I really was looking forward to seeing Jesse again, even if it was just for two weeks. Every time I talk to him I always ask him if he has heard anything about the second wave of R but he says not yet. I just don’t want him to get screwed out of his chance to come home even if it is only for a little while. I just hate having this feeling inside of me, this empty feeling. I see these couples walking hand and hand, or hugging and kissing and I am reminded that even though I have someone, I don’t have that. I see young couples walking side by side with their little ones and I don’t have that either. I miss feeling the way it feels to be in love and intimacy. Don’t get me wrong though, I do very much so love my husband and I always will but I am reminded that we have only been a married couple for 7 months together and 8 months apart and when he gets home it will be very close to celebrating our 2-year wedding anniversary. Every day I look at my wedding ring and I remember the day I said “I Do” to our minister under the shade of a beautiful shade tree, in front of my family and his and I smile from ear to ear. I often wonder if he thinks about that day, or anything else I think about.
