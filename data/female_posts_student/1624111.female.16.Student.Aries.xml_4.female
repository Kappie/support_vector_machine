I mean, its not that I don’t understand when someone talks about reality as being everything you can see and touch, because I understand that that is what a lot of people define as reality. But that’s not really what I think is real. My real is not textbook real. My real is not “1. a. being or occurring in fact or actuality; having verifiable existence: real objects; a real illness. b. true and actual; not imaginary, alleged or ideal: real people, not ghosts; a film based on real life.” And I could go on with the dictionary definition, but I think that’s enough to prove that my real is not the conventional real. My real is...having substance ...mattering...  having depth....existing beyond existence (ooh, i like that one)... reality is not what you can touch and feel and mathematically prove to take up space in the universe. reality is what is true when 2+2 does not equal 4 and its what you can feel and see when you close your eyes and touch nothing. It is far beyond the physical. it is the things that would still be if the physical world exploded into a million pieces and disintegrated tomorrow morning. in this way, reality (at least my definition) is contradictory, because it is not what is touchable and provable. it is not what has verifiable existence as an actual object. it is your ideas, your emotions, your understandings, your bonds, your beliefs, your...feelings. its what would still be true if all life was an illusion...its not the pencil on your desk...its all the things that exist only in the mind and only in the heart. i mean, i was thinking about this once when i was walking home from summer school last year...like...what if all those crazy people are right and life is really like the matrix or something and we live in some sort of fantasy world but really were in boxes somewhere with wires attached to our brains and bodies and some alien race or something is living off our body heat? well, thats crazy, for one, but...i was thinking about...and i was asking myself what is real...beyond everything what is real? The only thing I could come up with was my feelings. My feelings are real. How I feel about something is real, whether the thing itself is real or not. (not that the worlds not real…just…hypothetically) And so when I talk about things as being real I don’t mean…like…this keyboard is real…well, yeah, it’s real. But it is not a part of me that I can feel when im alone in darkness away from everything physical that ever existed. Those are the things that are real. People are real. A lot of times another person is the most real thing you know. And I think some people can be more real to you than others. Not that the other ones are fake or something, the just aren’t as…aren’t as real to you. Or something. And I cant really explain what I mean when I say someone can be “more real to you” than someone else. But I think its true. Because there are people who you can feel when you close your eyes and then there are the people you don’t feel…not that they aren’t real, because they are…but not to you. Yeah, so anyway, I just felt like explaining my real and a little bit about how some people can be more real than others. I explained that a long time ago on my profile…although I don’t know if I did a good job. It was before fencing one day…it was probably rushed. Maybe ill write some more on the concept of “real people” vs. “non-real people” but the point of this was to explain what I meant when I said “real.” Hope this makes sense. -adapted from an emily email
