Chelsey called me last night so we went out for dinner to Perkins cause we both used to work there and stuff and that was like so fun and well after we just hung out at her house and talked for like a million hours and when andreanna got home from work we were all listening to Christmas music..Lol.  Then I left around like sometime after eleven but man was it creepy walking in the dark.  Like I know self defense and all and even though I have my brown belt I kept thinking someone was like behind me or like hiddin in the bushes.  Then like I heard this noise and looked back and then when I looked forward again and I saw this massive shadow and I almost had a heart attack cause I thought it was someone else - luckily it was only my own shadow though.    And well I went to South Centre today and got a new winter jacket and some boots for when it snows and stuff and well I was doing my homework but social is no boring and I am behind and I just don't want to think about it anymore.  It is driving me up the wall cause I really hate how we always have to work through those guides and stuff cause I just don't have the time and patience to sit there and do that kind of thing - I wish they would just get up and teach already and well they should at least give an option if we want to be taught by someone or if we want to do it independantly but ya know I don't think that is going to happen.  And well AHHHHHHH math quiz Wednesday and I don't understand.  And well my goodness lately I've been coming to have like a totally obsession with space and that.  I don't want to be no astronaght (sp?!?) or nothing like that but I actually find it really fasinating and really cool!               I mean sometimes I wonder...what am I good at anyway - I have a lack of answers when it comes to that and when it comes down to it I don't really know if I have any talents.  I mean lets see I am not very good at Chem, or Math, or Social, or English, or Physics and yes the list goes on.  I've played sever years of soccer with fourteen medals, play the flute but I don't take band anymore because the theory is too hard for me, been sewing for a couple of years but really not very good at that, used to do a form of Korean Martials Arts and I have my brown belt but all that doesn't make me talented.  Why does it have to be like that...I mean just WHY???  I definetly KNOW it is not from lack of effort so I just really don't know and wish I did.  I wish I had some subject that I just would naturally excel at but Drama doesn't count because well anyone can act if they put the effort in and I wish that I just had something special that I could do that would define ME.  But right now I don't feel like there is.  And knowing that I am not doing well in Chem right now and I DON'T want to major in Physics if I am not good at Bio next term I have no idea what my purpose anywhere is.  I mean I know that my HEART tells me that no matters what happens my dream is to be some sort of Secondary Science Teacher and I couldn't imagine doing anything but that but in my MIND I just don't know if I can do it.  And I KNOW that if I don't become some sorta of teacher that has something to do with Science I will regret it all my life and will always wonder well WHAT If.... and will probably not be very happy.  I was so confident at the end of last year and so happy but I don't know what happened to all that happiness and I don't know what happened to that girl I once knew will all that confidence.  But then summer happened, and it changed everything.  Everything right now is changing and I don't really like change very much.  I was happy the way everything was last year but over the summer like Drivers Ed totally ruined my confidence and self-esteem cause of the fucking bitch of a lady who called herself Kathy who thought that she could stomp all over teenagers and tell them they are no good at anything.  I mean I don't hate alot of people and that is not really my think but I do know that I HATE that Kathy girl.  And well even though I met Aaron over the Summer our intial relationship was good but then everything just fell apart.  Everything fell apart in the Summer just the way it is falling apart now.     Hopes and Dreams  Just feels like everything is falling Knowing what my heart is calling Wondering in this mind of mine Hope to know what is right in time  Dreams arenâ€™t what they used to be Confidence left I cannot find in me Searching in this life of mine Hanging on this one lifeline  Gasping for that breath to take Looking around for a purpose I can make Questioning this authority somehow Thinking of these dreams right now  Falling through this dirty floor Knowing I am not welcome anymore Left alone and on my own Searching for a brand new home  Where shall my heart sleep tonight? These dreams are drained from this flight Everything now keeps falling in Surrounded by hopes I can only loose or win  Looking through the hands of time Finally I found that someone so kind Special, rare, and precious too She is someone just like you  When I am lost, she guides me through She knows just what she is suppose to do Sometimes I wish I could be just like her All her hopes and dreams they are so sure  In this destination she stands still But here I am waiting for that day until I find my confidence and achieve these dreams Knowing I have the willpower and the means  ~Vanessa     Maybe in a couple years from now I will probably laugh at the way I feel now.  But right now it feels so real and it feels like my heart is being crushed by everything.  My hopes, my dreams, my goals - all that I have even wanted in life I don't even know if I wil ever have any of it.  And hopefully in a few years I'll be at the U of C.  I've got it all planned out I just have to get the marks and everything which is a challenge now and I heard that now they only accept people with the highest marks and that is what it is based on.  But well I want to do three years in the science field and get a degree and then do the teaching program for two years and then get a job teaching somewhere is the S.W. or S.E. at a highschool and then I want to do evening classes and go for my masters in teaching.  That's my plan but somewhere along the way I want to meet my husband which I hope will be a big church go-er and someone who is also a teacher then I want two kids.  Not one, not three but two because one is not enough and three is too many.  I wish the sex of kids were in my control though cause I want two girls - Edele and Janine but ya know if so happens that I have a boy I like the names Eryk and Jaden.  So it's not like I don't know what I want in life because I KNOW EXACTLY what I want I just don't really know how to get there because it is not something that anyone can even have total control of.  and well I guess I just don't know and for now I will just have to keep going from day to day knowing where I want to go and trying to get there.
