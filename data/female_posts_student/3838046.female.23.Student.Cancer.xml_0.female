Oh well, last night I did the final one and hope all this nonsense stops there..  One more week of holidays...  I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS!! How can this be??  It's so weird that we have only  1 week  left and I feel like there's so much stuff undone.. Next thing I need to so is to reformat this darned destop and sell it off, then there will be more space on my table with a nice, small laptop =)  Looks like this week gotta double the efforts... here's a list of things I have to do...  thread eyebrows go gym (like min of 4 times this week) pack up my room help my bf move home, pack his room and get his furniture find some vendor to sell my 2 desktops give tuition + look for more tuition jobs have lunch with ex-colleague and visit them  Should I do my nails - nice nice before i go back to school? Extremely tempting!! Haha, see how my finances work out next weekend.. and I'm still trying to psycho my bf to get me the toy in watson's!!
