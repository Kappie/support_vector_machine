I will have to take the whole day tomorrow more than likely^_^;; Which is going to suck because people will be dying to get more. Speaking of which I have to get writing! Currently I am working on 3 stories:   -Public School (PG) -The Taiji-Ya Village (I think PG...) -Love Never Dies (R [Technically NC-17, but Anime Spiral doesn't go that high])   Look me up on Anime Spiral as  urlLink Kesshou ! I hate Fanfiction.net, so I use Anime Spiral instead. So before I dart off, I'll give the daily quiz result...     Goddess of the Moon. Beauty, yet a sadness lurks about you at times. But hey, pain is beauty, right?    urlLink   What element would you rein over? (For Girls)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Go Me!
