I am one of those people Harry makes fun of because they have so little connection with humanity that they go write in their xanga etc. in hopes that someone somewhere will give a shit.  So maybe I haven't complained on this too much recently.  That doesn't change the screwed-up-ness factor of my life.  And don't flatter yourself by thinking what's bothering me is something about you although you did assist in putting me down this fucking psycho path (oh wonderous Jeremy etc.)  Holy crap why are people such jerks.  On another note, what happened to my so called intelligence? Anyone seen it lately?  So maybe I can't get pissed at people when they unknowingly label me as a vapid bimbo.  HowEVER, I think I wouldn't be this dumb if there wasn't so much drama.  Go away drama.  I think everyone could help me out by quitting with the stupid stupid lies they constantly feed me.  Someday all of the people like me that sacrifice their self-respect in an attempt to amuse others are going to lose it and blow everyone elses fucking brains out.  I'm thinking maybe I shouldn't post this.  But honestly, does anyone read it? No.  But I can pretend.  btw, I'm not actually going to shoot people so dont go reporting me to the school or anything  also im not that depressed but felt like expressing anger at a few people  rawr  actually this weekend was nice :) but that doesnt change the all-encompassing theme that is this life.  enough of this emo crap  goodddbyeee
