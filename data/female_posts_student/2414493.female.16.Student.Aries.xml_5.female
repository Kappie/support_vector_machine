       
      It's 11ish, and I'm just having a good time reveling in my stupidity.  I wonder where all my stamina has gone. Even at the beginning of the year, my late-night/early morning record was past 3am. Now I'm lucky if I make it past midnight, still alive. Is it because the homework load has diminished? Probably not, since I still have the term paper to deal with, and when Mrs. Freeman--oh, shit, I realized I could do something journalism right now.   Anyways, I'll get to it soon. And my printer's running out of ink, too.  Right after I put up last night's post, I got a call from Tiff saying that Ryan and Mark had split from our main Excelsior body and was forming their own wind quintet kind of thing. So I'm like ok, they can go off and do their own kind of thing. But now I've realized that I haven't gotten rid of them just yet. Aw, that's such an insensitive way of putting it, too. As I understand it today, they're still part of Excelsior and all, just a separate branch. Ryan makes me mad sometimes, though. During English this morning he was talking to Alli about how he was starting a wind quintet and Would Alli like to join? I'd already heard about his secession plan but he didn't know it yet. I don't know if he was just flaunting it in my face to make me confused and jealous, but maybe I'm still a step ahead of him. Then, at the end of the day, we come out of history and he's like, "Have you talked to Tiffany today?" and I say no, knowing what he's going to bring up. He thinks he's so devious. He's not. He IS doing a good job of pissing me off though, so congrats, Ryan.   I really don't feel like I should have to go to the hospital tomorrow and have to talk to Irene about playing for us and then add that there's some other group that wants to do it too except we're not affiliated with them at all. That's just ridiculous, if you ask me. If you're going to cleave, go off and find our own venues. Don't make me do your work. I don't know. Maybe it's simply my misunderstanding of the situation, but I'm not too happy about what I see. And I was talking to Mark and Ryan comes on, or so Mark says. I'm still blocking him. And I think by now he knows it, so tomorrow morning will certainly be interesting. But I don't really care anymore if he just marches off in the opposite direction, because I don't have anything to say to him and anything he'd say to me is probably something slimy, as it was after sixth period today.   I am not a happy camper.  And for some reason, the journalism dealine now is next Monday instead of next Wednesday, so that cuts down on work time. My main concern is that I'm trying to put together an investigative article on plagiarism and turnitin.com, except I haven't gotten any interviews or information. Go me. I really feel terrible about it, though, and when finish this I'm making up a survey and seeing if I can pass it out to Ballard's classes, since he's so flexible about going off on tangents anyways. I'll see if I can capitalize off of it, I guess. It's just that I have my first driving lesson on Friday and I don't want to cancel, but I just might have to since it goes from 3 to 5pm and that's prime journalism time. I also have to tutor on Wednesday when I want to make up laps for PE (patching up for Costley's tyranny) so I'll have to get rescheduling in order, and even then, that still cuts into journalism time. I just want to fulfill my role as copy editor, too. Sometimes I feel like I'm so bogged down by other pages and other obligations that I'm not doing my job that's been assigned to me. And Keira has to house-sit starting Wednesday and tutor as well, so she's going to be busy. Melody's always busy. So maybe it's Jonathan, Coral and me, if I can manage to stay. OH, this sucks.  Mr. Francis saw the tape of me playing at the Contemporary Festival. It wasn't a happy scene. I've forgotten all about it by now and thought that I was getting off scot free; didn't happen. I also have a piano recital next weekend, too. I know it's an informal affair, just at his house, where he lines up the kids and has them go up and play whatever's ready, but I know that by the time I get up there, I won't be the same person who usually plays during lessons. And I'm annoyed because I did practice this weekend, just not honest piano stuff. I have Colburn on this next Saturday, the same day as the recital. We are all expected to come back from Colburn, grab something to eat and report to Mr. Francis's house to play. I'm doing the Chopin scherzo. Somehow I supposed that ok, maybe we weren't going to have a recital because so many have to go to Colburn, but it didn't work out that way. Oh, damn it, in the middle of journalism and schedule hell I also have to practice enough to be able to present Chopin at a recital.  Talk about a crappy day. I thought it was just because it was Monday's fault; I forgot my wallet and phone, I didn't exactly get paid for half an hour of tutoring (should I? $7.50, maybe?), had to deal with Ryan and the physio test and a history test and make like I didn't care about Excelsior.  Tiff annoys me a bit, though. She says I'm too uptight about things and thus takes all matters into her own hands, which I almost resent. I mean, whenever she sees me, it's like "Ok, bye" and she finds some reason to ride off into the sunset. I mean, ok, so maybe I am anal retentive, but that doesn't mean you have to deprive me of a civil greeting (what of the dork initiation today? HUH?) and of whatever's going on in Excelsior. Ok, so she can talk to Heather and I won't interfere. Just tell me what the heck is going on and don't make me feel like everyone else who gives a damn in Execelsior has just turned their backs on me.   Except Andrew. But God knows which side he'll wander off to.
