I had my maths trial...i could only do about a quarter of the paper, and of the quarter i reckon i only got a quarter right. I am hating everything. I swear, why bother with someone as stupid as i. I look around and everyone else is happy....HAPPY....  I wishing that it all would end. Oh it would have all ended were it not for my "friend" who had to have her own way. If i go no doubt she would blame me and hate me forever, actually i think thats what she wrote. that if i go i have hurt god and her or some shit....cant she see that being here hurts me. it hurts me more than anything. i dont want to be here.  It wont matter if i go now or later... i just hurt everyone when i stay here. I hurt everyone and i cant stand being here. i just want to go and i cant. i cant coz i dont want her 2 b angry at me. i am so scared. I...i just want to crawl into bed and stay there for as long as possible.       "Story of a lonely guy". There is no point to anything. Nothing. "I'm all torn up inside." What do i have to do? stupid. worthless. Useless. Its all pointless. No purpose. No direction. I wonder.... is it my "friends" fault. i wanted to go and she wouldnt let me.... so now, is all this pain and suffering her fault?       ~Aine
