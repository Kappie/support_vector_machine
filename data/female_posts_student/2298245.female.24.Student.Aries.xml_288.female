I myself saw it on MSNBC, and they did indeed call the first count "not guilty" and flashed a graphic reporting it as such before correcting themselves.  It struck me as ironic watching all these reporters stream out of the courthouse just as quickly as they could after the verdict was read, looking like complete idiots as they tried to communicate to their colleages in their own special way what had happened.  Of course, I sat there like a fool watching it, so I guess I'm their target audience.  And I must say too that something about all that confusion and chaos made it sort of exciting.  That said, I wouldn't have been injured in any way if I'd had to wait a few more precious seconds to hear the news, and that's all it would have taken for them to get it right.  As for the verdict, I must say I was surprised.  I haven't followed the case that closely, but from everything I have heard and read, the prosecution's case was weak.  It just goes to show that you never know what a jury is going to do, so it is best to avoid them to begin with.  In an informal poll in my Evidence class on Monday, most people seemed to think she would be convicted of  something  - even I thought she would be - but I didn't think they'd get a conviction on all four counts.  This probably means, that barring any favorable decisions for her on appeal, she will probably do some jail time.  Most experts say around a year to 18 months.  Very surprising indeed, in my admittedly uninformed sense.
