I emitted a little scream when her loved one/husband was killed in the middle of the night by her brothers though.   I wasn't expecting it.  Which was good, I get tired of the books where the plot line is so easy to predict (ie. chick lit.).  I have a habit of getting too into stories and not being able to put them down.  That may have led to my sleeping until 11am this morning.  I figure it's ok since I have nothing much to do today.  Just work at school some, and meet my father and sisters in a nearby town for dinner.  See, one sister lives in KC, and another lives in one on the way to KC.  All in all, we all live about an hour apart.  From my home town to KC.  I am considering wandering the stores in L-town (where my younger sis lives) before meeting with everyone.  Get some nice alone time.  Too bad I don't have money to spend after Thursday and Friday. You know what?  I sorta like my blog.  It's like my online journal that everyone gets to read.  Granted, not many do, but I still like it.  I've almost given up my real journal for it.  Nothing can replace paper and pen though. I'm considering actually styling my hair today.  This is how bored I am this weekend.  I never put much effort into myself...I guess Im not as girly as I sound.  Just think of all the mens that would be following after me if I tried!  I could get all the supermarket rejects.
