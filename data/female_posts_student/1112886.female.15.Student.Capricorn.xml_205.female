Blue eyes, as deep as the sea       Drowning, drowning, yet no misery.       Searching, searching for signs of life       All expressed here, love, happiness, and strife.  ok so its cheesy. pretty good for top of my head. his eyes are so beautiful. i luv elijah wood's and joseph fiennes' eyes. jf has green eyes. i'm so happy i got a luckogram from will shakespeare. he was so hot!!! in the movie of course. i cant vouch for real life, but we can ask bethany since she lived back then.
