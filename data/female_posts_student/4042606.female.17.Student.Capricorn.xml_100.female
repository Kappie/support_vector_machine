Jackie picked that lame blue template, but, she isn't here to force it on anymore so I am making it green. If you ever would of thought that the little teen princess would throw the biggest fit on earth, well youmissed it. I was there when she flipped out, it was totally awsome. She finally realized that I wasn't some little girl and I could take care of myself. She was just pissed that she could never have Mute. She thought I was trying to steal him away from her or something, even though we are just really good friends. That's why she got all pissed and left early, because she couldn't pressure Mute into things like she can with most people. And another thing, Mute was wondering if I still went by the nickname "Spinner". I hadn't been called that since I left for Pennsylvania. I am getting used to it again, as Ian is probably to me calling him "Mute" all the time.
