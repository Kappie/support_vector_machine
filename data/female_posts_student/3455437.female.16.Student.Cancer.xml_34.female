LOL, anyways thats pretty much all i have done. Malcolm got a new dog just like Ollie but its only 4 weeks old and it is so small, it has to be bottle fed, anyway when i went to Joelles yesterday and i was holding the new dog (which they called Cleo..) and it was moving around and i smelled something so i lifted up the dog and said to Joelle, something stinks and i was all confused n shit, then ....then ...IT PISSED ON ME. stupid little dog..i ran to the sink as fast as i could to wash it off and for then next hour Joelle couldnt stop laughing at me :@ bitch.. lol anyway im never holding that puppy again. well i probably will but the second that i see it do something strange or wriggle or something im giving it to someone else. stupid dog. heh anyway i better go and do something otherwise i would have wasted my whole weekend pretty much. check.
