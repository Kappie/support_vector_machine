I think my mum's having a funny turn, she has decided it is obligatory for me to go out tonight, as she loves my new hairstyle (which will only last a day) and top. She is craaazy and evidently having one of her funny turns...           The hairstyle is rather odd, kind of 70s style (although I'm sure I can brush it out with ease), and although the top is fairly pretty and in a style I like, I wouldn't really attribute it with magical compulsory going out qualities, but still...          On the one hand, she has offered to pay for my travel and anything else I may want to do while I'm there (I *told* you she's having a funny turn, there's my proof...)           But on the other hand, I have nowhere to go, nothing to do and a feeling of lethargy. Hm.          Ah well I'll probably give it a miss, especially as I can't just force myself on Jade as I would in such circumstances normally, being as she has graced the seaside town of Borth with her presence.          The dogs sit around moping and sometimes I feel obliged to mimic!           Enough about boring personal dilemmas. WATCH FRASIER. WATCH ALL OF FRASIER. ALSO WEST WING. This order has been brought on by my mum's recent purchase of season 2 of the former and season 3 of the latter on dvd, SO DAMN WATCHABLE IT'S CRAZY. Wit and cutting dialogue, so rare it should be treasured like platinum...          Eurgh my goddam hair's too bouncy!!!          Better go before it knocks me out...
