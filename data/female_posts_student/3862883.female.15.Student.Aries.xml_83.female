First it gives the story the classic western feel, but more importantly it establishes the two different places in the story, Tony's house and the desert.       Tony's house is life.  At the entrance the vines at the door are healthy and have white blossoms. The windmill is described as a sacred emblem.  While Durante is there the sky is described as beautiful.  Everything from the outside and from the desert is dark and ominous.  The air, from outside, is dry. After a little while there is no more blue sky. Eventually the desert cuts of his vision of the blue mountains, the only other thing described positively.  In this manner the description is very important to the meaning of the story because it really sets the difference between the desert and the havens of tony's house and the blue mountains.
