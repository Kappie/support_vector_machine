It's off to a good start... on Friday even though I was all sicky me Charlotte Josh and Nick went to Coulon Park ("Come with me, come with me! We're almost there!"), it was sunny and we had good times... then on Saturday I went shopping with my mom because she wanted to reward me getting good grades by getting a new outfit... but then it came to me that instead of that.. I would rather have my reward be Prince tickets... I'm not sure why that didn't occur to them earlier cause uh I've been bugging them about it for like two weeks.. but... I GOT PRINCE TICKETS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm sooo excited!!!! Yaaay! I got really not great seats but they were the best available... but I really don't care. Then... I got my hair cut again... it's really cute but I'm sad that I spent all that time growing it out just to have it cut off again. Oh well. I'm a short hair girl anyways. When I got home I went to Charlotte's.. we decided to drive around but then we were like let's pick up Erinn... and then we picked up Josh.. we went to Southcenter and messed around... then we went back to Charlotte's with Taco Bell and decided we must chill at Kuwanis (sp) Park down the street... and who should be there but like all the drama kids (i.e. Charlotte's drama people, i.e. people I tolerate but not neccessarily love, i.e. people I don't want to see without their shirts but somehow it happened) they were playing ultimate frisbee (? it was about 10 pm)... yeah but that was fun. Even though I'm not going on a vacation for once on a break, I'm liking it, I plan to do something every day, so far it's working. Well today's a family day cause it's Easter... I'm all full'a chocolate and eggies....lol we're going to go see Hellboy (???). Blasphemous? Oh well. Happy Easter everybody!
