There is an emo couple in my class; they are really creepy and a chinese guy with a mullet; makes me wonder. Anyways I really want to go to the Pixies concert so if anyone wants to donate tickets to me, go for it. I went riding today and met Laney. I'm doing a lot better at cavaletties, posting, and 2 point position. I have to start running and going to the gym again. Hopefully the pool is being drained sometime next week so that I won't have to take like 3 showers a day. Last night I found the funniest blog of someone who claims to be Andy Kaufman. I'll post the link later. Well I'm off to better and exciting things..riiight.. Current Song: Where is my Mind - The Pixies
