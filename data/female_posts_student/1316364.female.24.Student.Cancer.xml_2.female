I have actually been so worn out that when I get home in the evening I get so tired all I really want to do is sleep. I have talked to Jesse off and on all week but the calls are getting more spread out and shorter. I have a feeling they are keeping him plenty busy and that he is feeling the same way I do from day to day, tired and exhausted. I booked our hotel room for march and am looking forward to seeing him, I miss the world of him and I would give anything to hold him for 5 minutes. I just never thought I could miss someone as much as I miss him. My brother is coming over to work on my computer tomorrow so as soon as Saturday night I should have a computer I can go online with, I’ve been writing these at work, shhhhhh.  I can’t wait to get back online and be able to hook up my web cam so he can see me. I told him I have changed since Christmas, and I want him to see. I’ve lost some weight and I want to show myself off to him. He said he was so proud of me so I am glad. I wish he would send me a picture of himself soon, I am curious as to how much he has changed since he has been gone. When he came home for Christmas he looked a little different. I made the mistake of not getting a picture of him then, but you can count on me taking my camera when I get to see him.
