I am going to have a total dramatic airport entrance when I see my mother,  I am sure. I did get my flight plans though, I have about 10 hours of traveling which is just ridiculous because I should be flying directly to Texas.  I leave San Fran at 3pm on the 29th and have a connection in ATLANTA.    Isn't that ridiculous???? Freaking Atlanta. Anyway, 1 hour lay over there and arriving in Houston at 12:43AM. What a pain. I will not have much time to visit with my mom and Richard before we head to sleep to go to my grandparents' reunion the next day.  I am excited to see all of my family though as my grandmother has been updating them all on my travels.  I am sure I will be so tired ofhearing myself talk by the end of those 2 days.    Today was nice in Icy Strait Point but I didn't get off the ship because it was formal. I am always so busy on this day which just sucks in general.  Anyway, I got my afternoon nap and I finished watching the last 2 episodes o 24 Season One. Hopefully, our ACD, Bill will give me the season two set tonight. I am determined to watch all of these before I leave in 2 days. Hahahaah.  Okay, I will run now - picking up my table in about half an hour and then off to hang with friends for the night. Much love.  Shell
