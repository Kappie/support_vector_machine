So instead of just thoughts going through my head i could actually say them; it was great.  And through all of our (and by our i mean my... lol i didnt really shut up much and i think she wanted to sleep) talking im starting to completely change my way of thinking about all of this.  Like at first i didnt really see how his parents could change their minds about the whole situation... and let us start seeing each other, but now that i think about it more rationally and try to look at it from a parents' point of view i dont see how they can not eventually let up a little, even if its just a little bit at a time, i think they will eventually start giving him more trust.  I mean cuz i was thinking about it, and yea... if i were them i could see them having grounded him for the rest of the summer... becuz yea we totally broke their trust and lied to them, that is most definitely rooms for serious grounding... But... once school starts they'll have to start giving him more freedom.  And i mean they are doing all of this becuz they dont want him to fall in love at a young age, and i think they're trying to do all of this to show him that he's not really in love... like this is all so bad that obviously its not worth holding on.  But if we do hold on... and stay together... maybe they'll see that im someone that he actually cares about... and maybe they'll give me a chance to show that im not that bad of a person.  I dunno... i guess im just happy that im finally starting to look at all of this in a positive light instead of my wonderful gloomy outlook on all of it.  And i mean yea i miss him and i wish i could see him and talk to him more... like a normal relationship, but hey i love him, i can wait for all of that.  I mean what is so great about a relationship if u dont have to fight a little bit for it.  Im definitely convinced that if we make it through all of this, then we will be able to make it through anything...
