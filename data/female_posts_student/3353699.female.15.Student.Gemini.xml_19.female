(get the pic?) well anyways yeah they pretty much asked me if i would want to go snowboarding in chile with them just to be their translator. Now normaly i would think 2 guys like that would be joking, but one of them that i know od it a really hardcore boarder. so yeah it was still weird. Then after that i couldn't stop thinking about how awesome that would be to go boarding in chile. VERYVERY VERY awesome. but year right like i could actually go. yeah i can't stop thinking aobut that and just thought i would let anyone whos reading this know that little story. sigh, you know i was j ust thinking... to some people it would think it was weird that people like me are "pouring out our personal life on something like this" well lemme just ell ya. it's not really a personal life. well not for me anyway. see everything that im telling you is something that people would already know if they knew me or walked around my school with me. it's not even really my personal thoughts since whenever im thinking about something i have to tell SOMEONE. usually my sister gets that short end of the stick, but yeah. I guess some of this IS personal, but that's exactly why i don't give names. especially the one of the guy i like. but if you pay close enough attention and you know me, you can probably figure out who i like, just cuz i talk about him sometimes. and now i don't even remember why im on this subject, but yeah im just typing antything now in the hopes that someone will come across this and be amused. my sister is watching the pirates of the Carribean right now and it's at the part where jack sparrow is saving elizabeth Swan cuz she fell in the water cuz he corsette was too tight. hehe. it's a good movie to all you that haven't seen it yet. you should rent it if you haven't. cuz well. it's good. ok well i think that's all that really happened today. ill post tomorrow or something.  oh yeah i turned in my comic book today!! ITS DONE!!!!!! -drea PS *Mental note, copy Pantera CD for sam*
