I have always thought myself more the raging liberal.  But, upon questioning, I found myself the newest member of the recently created St. Mary's association for Law and Life.  This is  a pro-life group.  I told them I would only be able to join if I could still think that some abortions were permissible, i.e., rape victims, incest, mothers life in danger, etc.  Apparently this was okay, so my name is on the members list.  Wow.  I could never have foreseen this.  Yes, I suppose I am a fan of life, life is good, death bad, but I cannot adhere to any extremist view.  This group seems to run the gambit, myself representing more the liberal side, big surprise.  They had a table at school today and I helped and hung around a bit, got a buddy to sign up after assuring her that I am not an extremist and many others are not.  But, my friend from PILA [Public Interest Law Assoc.] let all hell break loose, feeling strongly that the proliferation of these ideas of a pro-life group were detrimental to society, that we might bring others to the dark side.  I don't understand how she can be shocked that a political organization exists on a law school campus?  Is this a surprise captain obvious?  I want to be involved in the upcoming service projects where we do diaper drives and the like for places like the unwed teenager mothers home.  Is this so bad?  Do I need to feel weird about that?  I am not an activist, but for those that in dire straits have chosen to have  a baby, should I try and help?  There decision is good a baby lives....it is sad when babies don't, and for indigent, mothers such a decision would be trying, should I feel crappy for being a part of this group.  Have I switched sides, or did I think this way all along?  Where would I draw the line?  I believe in gray areas, substantially, mainly, but for women who by their own volition get pregnant [yes, captian obvious if you have sex, babies may follow], and are financially set-able providers, why should they be allowed to have an abortion?  How could this end be the desirable one, shouldn't we say no, life is good, yes you will have to learn to get up at three a.m.and feed someone else, but don't most of society's evils stem from our apathy towards another?  Where did love your neighbor as yourself go?  or Treat others as you would like to be treated?  Faith, hope and love, but the greatest of these is love?  This is a catholic school, for God's sake, how in the world is a pro-life group's mere existence itself a shocker?  The wonders never cease.
