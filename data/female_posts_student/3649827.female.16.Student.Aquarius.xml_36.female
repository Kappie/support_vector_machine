(welll that and my license and etc)   but nothing in some other things i usually hope for...   but that's all irrelevant   the point i'm trying to make is that, the friend thing was good.   i liked it. it was the summer of the bubble.   i don't know if the bubble is a good thing...just b/c well i'd prefer my fellow bubblians to anyone else. sort of. i don't know nemore.   nevermind.   it's like i'm sad b/c not a lot of bubble members are in classes with me. and i'm afraid the bubble might deteriorate over the year. and i'd be heartbroken. b/c i've come to be close to my bubble.   and i really like the ppl in my bubble.   and i want to keep it like this. i don't want school to start. i don't want to think about it.   what if i don't like ne of my classes?   maybe i'll drop out. dammit. no i won't.   i have to go pick up my parking spot tomorrow. i hope nothing bad happens, and i don't get it or something.   i'm sorrry this was so useless, i swear i thought i was going to say something, and it was going to be interesting, and i would feel good about it.   but apparently not.   now i shall try and force myself off the internet and get to working on that damn summer work.
