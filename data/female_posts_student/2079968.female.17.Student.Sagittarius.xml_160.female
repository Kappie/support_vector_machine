It's much easier than the SAT...I took both just to see if I'd perform better on one than the other. I think I did okay on them both, but I want scholarship money! I know I took them both a little later than most juniors do, but this is the only time I really could this year.   Shooting for at LEAST a 1200 on SAT; 24 on ACT. I will just be so relieved once I finish applying to schools and get an acceptance letter. Wow, I realized how much I'm rambling. Forgive me, it's tiredness.  Maybe I'll write more later, but now I'm gonna go chill out a little.  Hey! Keep suggesting CDs, ladies and gents! I love getting feedback!
