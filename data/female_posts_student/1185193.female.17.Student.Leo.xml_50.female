And yes, there was already a line.  Isn't that crazy?  Gosh, these parents sure love their little dancers.  By the by, I don't know the actual catchy title, but the theme of the show has something to do with TV.  I don't know if I've mentioned that before, but I guessed with my dance numbers named "Wonder Woman," "The Jeffersons," and "Bonanza," I thought you would've guessed.  In other news, I am going to see the movie  urlLink Mean Girls  this afternoon.  It has gotten really  great reviews and I really like Lindsay Lohan (mostly from her Disney days and The Parent Trap).  I'll report back my own review later.  If I don't give my review today, it's because I was too tired and had to take a nap before going to babysit my little Willow Glen Brats tonight.  Fun!
