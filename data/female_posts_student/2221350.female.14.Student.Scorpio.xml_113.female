I love blogs. Speaking of which, I think I'll sell tee shirts that say "I Love Blogs". It will make the internet freak wearing it feel special because everyone will ask them "what is a blog?" and they will get to explain.   today was nice. I went and saw shrek 2 and ate Mexican food avec muh peeps. As soon I was in the house, mamaw invited me to bingo, so I threw another $15 down the drain, and now I'm finally home, sick of people, and glad to be alone.  I better get over my antisocialness quick though, cause tiffy invited me to bowling with her and some other folks.   I haven't talked to Johnny john in a looong time, I think I'll call him. waaaaah.  when I'm busy doing stuff like this.. Movies, bowling, lunching, I have no time to think. It is annoying. I must think now.  shrek by the way... Awesome. It was sooo cute! I cried at the end.  lately I've been obsessed with the distillers. If any of you out there have the privilege of kazaa and haven't been arrested yet, I would recommend them highly.  it's not the things we do, it's the things we aspire to do, that makes us the people, the dreamers, the poetic couch potatoes.
