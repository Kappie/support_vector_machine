And I've just realized, after conversation, that I can't stop. Everywhere you go people'll ask you how you did and you'll have to sheepishly reveal that you were as pathetic as to not make it to the top four teams, as you've done for the past few years. It just doesn't feel like a mock trial this year. From personal experience, I've come to associate the whole entire final lap, shall we say, with the stuffy jury assembly room and all of us in our white collared shirts, having already taken off our jackets. We're standing and sitting in the back row, as we always are, and we hold hands and look at each other: "This is it." And when they annouce that Westlake has made finals, we all toss our arms up in the air and hug and kiss random people because we're so amazingly happy and nobody gives a care.  But now, it's computers, the "insurmountable computer error," and a rainy afternoon. And not making finals.  I will not philosophize.  I feel almost the same way I felt when Nick died. I know it's not comparable at all, really, in terms of magnitude, but I'm still sitting here with the Burberry on and sometimes I just have to make myself think: hey, am I supposed to be crying here? am I supposed to be grieving? Should I assess what mock trial meant to me and what I feel now that it's over and done for this year?  And then again I will steal away from this compulsory grief and find the strangest solace--in piano, of all places. All I need now, I think, is just the casual somberness of the Szyumanowski, the confusion (and the sloppiness that stems from it) of the Ravel, the elegant Schumann. It's funny: I haven't found this kind of peace in a long time, and I have forgotten how it feels to get your fingers worked up, to just get carried away.  It's raining hard now. I think I could almost enjoy it if my contacts weren't threatening to pop out and if I had that same kind of satisfaction inside me as I should feel when the rain is falling outside and I know that I am safe and dry.  I need to do a lot of thinking tonight, too. I'm already behind in schoolwork, but I think that will be solved with a little extra diligence, and it's time I got back into the rhythm before I am too tempted to forego school altogether for reasons of "illness." I would like to go to finals tomorrow night and just sit there and take notes. I don't know if there's anyone else who even cares enough, and already I can imagine a few who won't bother to show tomorrow night at the courthouse. I don't know if I can skip orchestra, but I think it'd just make me feel better if I went, though I cannot afford to play the role of snubbed competitor.  In four days, I have felt two kinds of peace. Peace tonight knowing that it's done with and there's nothing more to be done. I know there's the second part of that feeling, that "what did I do wrong?," but for now, I'll just leave it be. And peace in the security of being around people who mean, strangely, more to you than you expected. And truly, this time.  I know such things don't last, for I wouldn't be able to appreciate these things without proper tumult, but tonight I'll accept what I have.  Keep me strong.
