I want to grab him and hold him in my arms. We have reasons to hide it, good reasons, and I don't want my family to know. But he acts like I'm not even here at all. I know that's acting natural, but it's so hard. It's horrible. I don't know how to catch his eye without being obvious but it is hard. I want to kiss him. Just take him aside and remind him, Remember me? Tomorow holds such promise and excitement, I can hardly contain without exploding. I don't know how it will be, or what we will do, but maybe that's the best part. I'm so nervous and anxious, but if I get to be with him then it's all worth while. Hiding is hard. I can't even sit beside him without looking weird. I got to hold his hand today. It kinda made me jitter, even if we were trying to knock each other over. I can't wait until we can do it, and be sincere. Tomorow, no matter what, when I see him I'm going to hug him. Show him that I mean business. Life is tough but I'm living. And I love it.
