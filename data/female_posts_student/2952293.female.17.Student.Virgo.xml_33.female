Let's go back to the beginning...(no this is not a dirty ho Hilary Duff song)... It was last Tuesday. I got up, felt a little weird but ate some breakfast, got ready, and was about to leave. As I came down the stairs, I felt like I needed to sit down, so I did. Then I thought I just needed some water, so I went to the kitchen sink and started to drink some water. Then I threw up. Twice. So, as the responsible girl that I am, I went to school. Yes boys and girls, I went to school after throwing up, let me tell you why: I had gym class that day. Welcome to the life of a unicorn, I went to school for gym. See, if you miss it, they make you make it up, and I just do not have that kind of time. So I took a plastic bag with me to school and was prepared for another day. In announcements, I started to feel bad again. Everyone told me to go home, so I went to the nurse's office. I laid down and then ate some crackers. I started to feel better, and I decided to go back to class. MY mom said if I got worse, I could call and come home. So I go to second period, and it got worse. I could hardly lift my math binder. It was like running a marathon. I was so cold and shaky, Ann thought I was an idiot, so I went back to the nurse after class. That was 9:45. I wanted to go home, so we paged my mom. I laid down again. Long story short, my mom NEVER got the pages and only called to check and see if the nurse had heard anything. I left school at 12:15. I know. SO I went home and slept a lot. And I stayed home on Wedenesday as well. My head hurt so much, I could hardly leave my bed. Wednesday night I felt better and was planning to go to school the next day. Thursday morning I woke up at like 5:30, screaming from cramps. Yes, I got my period right after being sick. I was writihing in my sheets from pain. I took like three Aleve and got out the heating pad and tried to relax. I swear, I thought I was going to give birth to something, I didn't know what, but something was coming out.  I went to school. Classes were shorter for Red/Gold day, which was nice. I told Dr. Doden I was back, and he asked me who I was. AHH DAMN YOU! I was really obsessed with Doden on Thursday. I got a good math grade and Ms. Potts was nice to me. Ms. King has been in our math class to prepare for her college classes coming up, and she's super nice and funny. I want to be her study buddy, cause she's going to take our math test. Chemistry was funny too. We played with the $10,000 computer with the touch-screen. CP was funny. I did sooo badly on my spanish test, I can't even tell you. Then I had AP spanish. We really have to work, since the test is coming up, but we talked about my problems the whole time. Senor was actually nice, for once. Then I went and told Zazu I was upset about what she said to me in the Student Council meeting, she apologized, but didn't mean it. Instead of the Red/Gold games, I had to go to the Honor Code meeting, BORING. That night was so fun, though. Erica, Lizzie, and I (or as I have now named us "The Raisn' Craisins") has some funnny times! We went to go see The PRince and ME, just to make fun of it. IT was bad and we made fun of it. But we took a bag of Craisins with us, and things got wild. WE threw them at people out the car and were screaming. In the movie, I offered a hand-full of Craisins to these girls next to us!!!!! We were super into stickers too. We went to CV Wrapers and stole the stickers they stick on your food. I had "BLT" and some others and my favorite "Mexican Burrito" cause people think I am MExican. I also had this sticker with a cow on it on my face. We had so much fun, the three is back! Friday me and Liz went to a concert. Eri went to look at some school in Indiana, so she couldn't come. We went to see Mest with Fall OUt Boy, Matchbook Romance, and Dynamite Boy. My sickness was still present. I couldn't eat anything, because I thought I was developing Acid Reflux disease. Everything burned down my throat. So I went with very little in my stomach. We got there at like 3. We wanted to meet Fall OUt Boy, cause we love them. But we waited for a REALLY long time. This one adorable man, with a lip ring, and a camo hat kept coming out. Finally he saw us sitting there after like three hours and kind of laughed, this is how it went down: Man comes out, sees us, and chuckles ME: "Yeah, we're STILL here" He starts to walk over: "That's okay, I don't care." Me: "We want to meet somebody!" HIM: "WHo do you want to meet?" Me: "Fall OUt Boy" Him:" THey're really nice, just go over there and talk to them!" Liz: "Are you in a band?" HIm" Yeah, Dynamite boy."   I felt really bad cause he was in a band I didn't know!   Anyways so we went over and the guy in the hat kept coming up and saying "JUst get in there, they're really nice!!" He was cool. In reality, the guys in FOB were kind of strange. The one named JOe, looked at my Mexican Burrito sticker and we ended up having a talk about races and religions, yeah I don't know. The good thing about these concerts is that you get to know a lot of people and you see them at every show. So we talked to some funny people. The concert was good. We were right in the front of the pit. There were moshers, but we were far left so it wasn't too bad. Except for MEst, I ended up holding onto the barrier with my right arm, and my body was completly to the opposite side. This girl had a spike belt on and when she would jump, we were so close that my shirt came up and her spike slid against my side. IT hurt. then one time my arms were crossed at the barrier, and when people on either side of me would jump, my own arms would choke me. I coudln't breathe  A LOT. That was bad, plus I was really hungry and my acid reflux hurt a lot. All the guys in the bands were friends and would come out and sing each others songs. Then they all hugged. I've never seen so many boys so touchy-feeley. It was worse than CSG. IT was funny. One band had their last night, and they threw flour at them at the end of their set. It was funny. Some girl threw up a tampon at Mest. This is gross, get prepared. Tony (lead singer) opens it up, says "you must be on the rag" and then puts the whole thing in his MOUTH! Then he starts going on about "the rag" and all that. HEY YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE! It was funny though.  THIS IS THE LONGEST BLOG EVER, I need to go do something else. BYE!
