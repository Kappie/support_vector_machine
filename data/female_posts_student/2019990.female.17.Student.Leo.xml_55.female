I actually had a really good conversation with my Aunt today on the way to check on some of her patients about having medical anointing.  (That's where when you pray for people you can actually feel the hol spirit going into that patient.)  She's had this laot apparently, it's pretty cool.  She also told me some interesting stories about my mom.  There's alot of stuff she never told us.      The house has settled down now.  Htis moning we went to my Aunt's church, which was really fun, it reminded me alot of  Willow Creek, and it cracked me up, because they were projecting their powerpoint sutff on trampolines.  It was neat.  hen we came home and took a nap after I followed her on rounds.  Naps rock.  Then we took her dogs for a walk on a trail she has three houses down from her. That is the prettiest trail I have ever seen.  I'm definitly getting ym camera down there asap.     I should get going though, we have to be at the ofice ealy tomorrow as my aunt's first surgery is at 7:30.  I'll talk to you all later.  Mwah!
