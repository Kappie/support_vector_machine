I'm planning on learning how to play some of the songs on my flute over vacation. Oh yeah man, I'm a real party animal like that. Yesterday I went to see Lord of the Rings for the second time, and it was still really good. We were all dressed up (yes, we are dorks like that) and we saw Mrs. Dunn. The funny thing was, she saw us first. Yeah, that was interesting. (luckey for me I have a good grade in english) We were supposed to do something tonight, but no plans were ever made, so I'm pretty much just sittin around here looking like a bum. Oh well, I have my Billy Boyd.   Home is behind The world ahead...
