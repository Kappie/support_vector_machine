And I'm so tired I can't handle it.  I feel disappointed. Disappointed in myself.  I feel really unstable. I think it's from lack of sleep, or frustration...  Being nice to people really backfires sometimes.  I go out of my way to just overwhelm people with kindness, and they stab me in the back...or in the chest. Or both.   It really bothers me that so much effort can be so useless. At least I know that I'm the better person.  I'm too good for some people's shit.  I'm too good to lower myself to certain people.  Quite honestly...in my opinion (which is always rights...and I'm really not joking either)...I'm just plain better than ALL of those people.  The way I see it...anyone who is childish enough to hate me for no reason and hold a delusional grudge...is too far below me for me to acknowledge.  I'm too good to consort with trashy people.  Boy oh boy I sound like a conceited bitch.  Good.  Because with all the effort I have to put into to being nice to some people, and reaping no rewards...I have the right to be a bitch.  And let's face it...I don't have to hold anything back about being slightly conceited...I don't walk around talking shit like I AM the shit...but I can justify who stands below me.  Anyways I need to go to sleep...I can't take this anymore...  G'night crazies.
