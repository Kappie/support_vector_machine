We were in a circle outside at night, around a small campfire. One of the stories was about La Llorona and her children. Another was about the candyman. We didn't try saying "candyman" three times, everyone was too scared to do it. I felt scared, i don't know why, maybe because of the candyman or maybe because it was dark at the time.
