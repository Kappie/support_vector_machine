FUCK YOU RIGHT IN YOUR DIRTY LITTLE ASS WITH OUT LUBE.  FUCK YOU TIL YOU BLEED.   No, this isn't an angry rant about wheelchair guy or any of my other insensitive prick stories.  This is a matter of just climbing out from under the moutain of bullshit that has been the last three years of my life.    First of all, when people come in and ask for a parking permit and I tell them its on the first floor, don't get huffy with me because you have to go back downstairs.  If you actually  read  the letter you were sent, you'd have seen that it says the permits are issued by the Finanace Department,  but available at the parking permit office on the first fucking floor across from the elevator.  Also, it is not my fault that you are being charged a late fee on your bill becasue you decided you were too important to mail me a $10.00 check in July, and when you've paid late every single year for the last two years.  Also, don't try and tell me that you've never paid this before, 'cause I'm gonna fucking tell you both of the past check numbers  AND  that you were late both times.  It will only get uglier from there.  Last week I had an unfortunate accident: I went to the proctologist and he did a seemingly delightful thing by taking my head out of my ass, however this apparently removed me from being in the running and being qualified for any of the positions here in the Town.  Furthermore, it is absolutely ludicris that I am not  qualified  to be a fucking secretary here, and its even  more  ludicris that  I am qualified  to be a financial analyst like Anthony and do the same work ( PLUS  my Alarm Ordinance duties on top of it) and still not be able to get the same pay rate as him 'cause of "union issues".    You know what: this isnt the first time this shit has happened.  I should have taken that job at mastercard, but nooooooo, I decided that although you had fucked me in the ass once before it wasn't good enough, I wanted to stick around for  more  lubeless anal maraudings...that maybe this time I'd get lucky and you'd use something sharp like a fucking pine cone, you fucking jerkoffs.    I'm so out of here, you can keep paying me the same bullshit pay-rate you've got me at and dick me out of my first step which should have netted me 3k more a year cause there was an "issue" and I will just sit here and use your precious time to look for a new, better job with an entirely different set of bullshit co-workers and issues, but you know what: at least I'm  choosing  who gets to fuck me up the ass rather than leaving it up to my supervisors and union reps to decide who gets to hold the broom this week.    Fuck off and die and I will keep staring longingly at the paper cutter looking for a swift way to slit my wrists with it.
