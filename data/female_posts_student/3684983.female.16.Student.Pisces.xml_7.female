I know I had to move on.   After all, it was me who suggested a break up.   It was me who never even try with whole efforts to change for better and raise the white flag to surrender.   Though I hate to admit the fact that I am the one, who is selfish, immature and stupid.   I should at least keep on trying to communicate with him.   Now he's all well blessed with an angel.   The angel I guessed he had been searching for ages, who totally care and concern about him.   Unlike me, I was a timid coward who is trying to find the best way to escape from problems rather than solving them.   With sincerity and whole-hearted, I wished him happy always although my heart still do felt heavy sometimes.    2nd.    Almost all who are familiar with me knows that I had a crush on a guy for 5 to 6 years.   However, in the early this year, I've decided to stop my obsession.   There's no need an explanation, because there's forever could not have any sparks between us.   Its not that I have not tried hard enough, its just that I'm tired.   I could not find any reasons to carry on my crush on him because there's been no improvement.   Similarly, he is also well-blessed with an angel.   Words are not my forte at the moment now.   I'm speechless.   Feelings that left to be describe but not describe, are feelings that usually holds with significant meanings.   Without hesistation, he is one of the important person in my life.   Now, I don't know...
