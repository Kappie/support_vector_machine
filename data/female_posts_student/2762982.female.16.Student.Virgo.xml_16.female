I don't handle relationships well >.  Yay for problems.  I'm over at my mom's, when I'm supposed to be at my dad's, which has created a lot of family stress.  Moved to my mom's for the week my dad was away on business, and here I solved a lot of issues I was having, and decided that it would be better for me if I was just able to stay here...yeah...brought that up with dad and wow.  He never gets anything.  He's always looking at things his way, that or he doesn't register what other people are trying to say and takes them one way without asking what they really ment.  I can't handle it.  I've put up with it for so long, I'm sick of it.  Yes, I said I would rather live with my dad, and guess what, at the time he was spoiling me silly and I was taking advantage of it.  Woohoo!!  Got a car and a new computer (which currently sucks) out of it, which is pretty cool considering.  Anyway, he's pissed and keeps saying I'm running away from him (and when he's like this it's probably true, but any child would) and that I'm abusing the situation >.  Kat...yeah...that's an interesting problem.  We get along, sometimes >. . .  I think I'm muttering nonsense now >.
