Oscar said that my theme song was  Avril Lavigne's  Complicated ......   Normally, I'd protest but within the context he was right. My life is complicated on it's own, but how I've chosen to deal with things or better yet NOT deal,my hyper-sensitivity,my need  to deconstruct and overanalyze everything just MIGHT add to the drama........ just maybe maaaaaaaybe lol....  hey I'm working on it. What helps is honesty. It simplifies the conversation. Honesty not just with myself but  with others as well.  I'm sick of lying and keeping secrets. I've been doing that my whole life and I'm not doing it anymore. It's killing me. It's gotten to a point where I can't give a straight answer to save my life and when people push I feel cornered and the cycle begins anew. Ask me a question and you'll see.    Person: So what do you think of slam?  Diane:  Well the real question is what IS slam? Where has slam been where is slam going?.....   Person: So are you seeing anyone?  Diane:  I see people all the time. I'm seeing you right now...   Person:  What's your name?  Diane:  well there are names and there are identities......  And I can and will go on like this forever.....I'll just talk until you forgot what you asked in the first place :) Just take a hint and drop it. I'll let you know when I feel like it.   soo.....  last night I read Tesseract and got some great ideas/edits for it. I subsequently got into a discussion on a theory of love with a highschool physics teacher in the audience....it was dope :) Then we talked about string theory.... I miss physics...... *sigh   Sal was there and heard me read for the first time and she liked it! This means alot because from my understanding Salome doesn't like poetry, or better yet  she doesn't like bullshit. and pretention. and poets. Period. Ironically Tesseract has not been my favorite poems, because it can do alot more. It's one of those poems that upon first read it SOUNDS really cool, but when you reread it, it's just a bunch of fluff at least to me it is, maybe I don't like it so much because of it's  potential to go much further and much deeper. Lately it's nice to have your work liked PERIOD. Artistically I haven't  gotten that support and my ego needed stroking/validation.    Anyway being the total geek that I am I said "yeah I'm a closet nerd" and  Salome responds:  Closet? You mean glass closet with the the doors wide open? Girl you are a NERD!  (*note:If you suspect that you're full of shit, have a conversation with Sal and she'll clear that up for you)  I don't know why that validation made me feel so cool. The Nerd Validation not the poet one.......ummm  because you're a nerd. Yup.  So speaking of Sal and of honesty, here's another  quizzical Quirk.   I consider myself heterosexual, meaning I'm attracted sexually and romantically to men and exclusively so. In this bi-curious world of gender ambiguity, that's probably one of the few really defined things about myself.......I've never been into women, I've never been repressed about being into women, I've had many opportunities to be with women. I figured if it was going to happen it would have already.  However I still get crushes ;) I'd say it was admiration but it's more than that. Never really having a woman to look up to growing up I get these weird non-sexual crushes on women that I look up to. If freud ever factored women in his psychoanalysis maybe he'd talk about the effect of maternal absence on girls...  When I was a freshman it was my Voice teacher.... Strong, beautiful, confident, talented, when she walked by everything happened  in slow motion.... but it wasn't sexual and it was more than admiration.... When I came to New York I there were a string of women who fit this category.... and secretly they  became my blueprint...for the woman I wanted to become....they've been helping me grow up...grow into that woman I want to be come....I just have no idea how.  So here I am 23 and still awkward and goofy, trying to tap into a woman that is confident,graceful and gracious........ Men...if women are a mystery to you, they are an even bigger mystery to me and I AM one   And In Totally UnRelated Poetry News  1. urlLink Evert Eden  joins the blogging community. Go Check him out.  2. What is Beau Sia doing in the  Manchurian Candidate ? His cameo is just as random as the one he did in  Slam    3. As of last night Team Providence at NPS is on the run :)    I have a special place in my heart for anarchists and a newfound    respect for Carlos Gomez and Jive Poetic. *quoted from guy's livejournal  urlLink    Jared Paul and the Providence team apparently caused some drama at the opening ceremonies with a group piece related to the Abu Ghraib prison tortures that included Jared in a loincloth and some accidental nutsack peek-a-boo that led to him being arrested for indecent exposure. The resulting hubbub reportedly shut down the opening ceremonies! Some are dismissing him as an opportunistic asshole. Personally, I applaud his efforts and hope some of those t-shirt wearing faux-activists take notes.    here here. Showing your balls and risking getting kicked off stage is applaudable. So is team that does either all or mostly group pieces...I'll stop now.   4. All the NYC teams have won their bouts and are in the top 15.  5. Three New Yorkers, (two nuyoricans and a transplant) are in the top 10     6. While I understand that last night was Guy's final feature/appearance, part of me treats it as Cher's repeated farewell tours and Jay-Z's black album: It's difficult for me to believe that I'll be hearing the last of him poetically. However taking the pressure off has a tendency to open you up to writing more. I understand the need to break off, break out. I'm in a similar place or similar plateau. I'm excited to see what the future holds, artistically and personally :) Guy's  inspired me poetically and personally.... I doubt he realizes the influence he's had on me as a writer. How does it feel was inspired by  Leaps of Faith  Sanctity of Stillness inspired by his poem  Salome  Enough of the ego stroking, ya know I loves ya like a fat kid love cake... and I love cake. Like several people said last night, I wouldn't still be involved in this scene where it not for guy, which is ironic since he was never around for most of my slam career, but his voice lingers in my head.
