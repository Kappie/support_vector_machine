This claim is nothing new, since I've seen products that promise this since I started buying  urlLink Mood Matcher lipstick  in 5th grade and it looked identically grotesquely fuschia on everyone who put it on.  My Lip Miracle contains  urlLink hydrophobic pigments  which make me think this lipstick will be afraid to go swimming but probably just means the stain will last through a drink or two as will most greasy, I mean "moisturizing" lipsticks.  Other Intuitive Technology products on the pipeline include 10-day nail enamels, All-day eyeshadows, lipliners, and mascaras. Avon traditionally offers half price specials when new products launch, check out  urlLink Avon  in September.
