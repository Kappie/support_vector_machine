To start getting mega-sick right before something that I have been looking forward to doing for months. Plus there's the pool party tomorrow night. :\ ...(@ Sara Cree Hall at Shepherd, if you have any clue where that is, you should go! It'll be great!) It's a fund-raiser for the pool at Jackson's Mill.  ...And, yes, the pool is indoors....
