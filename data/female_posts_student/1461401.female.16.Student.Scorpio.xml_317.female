This paper is going to consume my weekend, along with my ten-page study guide for science and the pops concert on sunday. Speaking of which, you should really go to that. It's Sunday night at 7:00 at Kobacher Hall and it's free. As far as I can tell, it's going to be ok, and we're all going to be fancied up so why not come?  done.   only moments (hours) later: I'm done! My 10 page biology study guide is completed!!! And I have an evidence warrant sheet for my stupid english paper! Yay!!!  so... tired... *falls down*
