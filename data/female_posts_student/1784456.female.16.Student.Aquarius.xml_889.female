Any way, back to serious (riiight) I should stop reading those Jostein Gaardner books they make me go all phsychological! *is that right?* Well... look at this  urlLink http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,545653,00.html  Or read on... I don't really care, I'm happy in my pink haven. :) (Really needing to get out more) Do you think robots will take over the world? (LOL!) Sorry, sounds sooo stupid! Well... robots don't have a consciousness right? So they have no desires or needs, they don't hate or love, so why should they want to or ever get that idea into their heads? It would have to be planted by a human and they would have to be trained to kill, they would never want to because they would never be able to want any thing. So basically... in theory if they were programmed to they could... But some one would have to programme them, and the machines that make them, and the transport. If that person died then where would we be? However you look at it, a human would have to be behind every robot. Was the egg not before the chicken? Ahh... I have no more thoughts on this subject (cause I'm tired and ill) so say what you want in my meaningless void of silence.
