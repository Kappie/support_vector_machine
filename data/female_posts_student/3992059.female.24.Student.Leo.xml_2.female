For some reason corporate thinks that it's better to kick out all the residents and send them to nursing homes and then get more residents who don't require as much care there.  Understandable.  Actually, it's kinda cool.  I'm going to miss them all though.  I love the residents there.  They are wonderful to work with.  I know I have complained about it before but it's actually kinda nice.  Where else can I work and basically sit on my butt all night long?  It's nice for when I'm in the nursing program.   Speaking of...I'm so scared.  I have a math test in a week and I don't know what the hell I'm doing.  I also have so much homework to do that it's crazy.  HELP!!!!!   Ugh.  this entry has absolutely no point to it.  So here it ends.  See you later Mr. Bloggie.
