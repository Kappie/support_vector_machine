We had a carnival made up of indoor and outdoor activities with different game stations and attractive rpizes to win/ This was all specially planned for our invited guests from the various children and old-aged homes. It was definitely an enjoyable one! We had our very own tpjc Radio Station with 2 lively DJs keeping the atmosphere to the MaX! We could make our dedications which consist of a mixture of Chinese, Indian and English pop songs ... which were played continuously throughout the whole event.   On my part... I definitely had os much fun netertaining them... Chasing after all those little kids, teaching them how to play the games and having to endure all the bursting of balloons that was surrounding.. (it was like a time bomb man~ ahaha) Anyway, it was really my pleasure to be given the opportunity to mix around with these kids. Although it wasn't enough to get to know them better, but I believe that my small effort had definitely managed to make someone's day better!   Maybe they are a little different from us, but their courage and determination to attempt the different games had really touched me a great deal... (no words can express it all k...)   I really look forward to such actvities in the near future, I believe we will be able to make it better each time. 3 ChEeRs for all Of us! =)
