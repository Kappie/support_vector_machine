Woohoo!....well, actually, I'm already a homeowner...it's just that I won't be living in an apartment 4 days from now.  I'll be in transition (aka living in sin with Bruce) until August 8th and then it's off to Orlando!  What sucks is that I won't be able to really unpack until September since the Valestons won't close on thier house for another month. But I won't have an 8 year old child stomping up the stairs on the other side of my living room wall anymore, and I won't have to pay another security deposit!  Homeownership rules!
