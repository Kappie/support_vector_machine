Today at church, i sat with steven, kirby, amez, and chesson. I don't think i even remember what the name of the sermon was because i didn't pay attention at all. Kirby proposed to steven, but sadly got turned down. :( haha. So after church I gotta look at Steven's pictures from SD and they were awsome so i've gotta borrow them sometime to make copies.   Then we went to my g-parents house in prosperity. it was loads of fun. not. I told my grandma about shrubbery. She thought it was hilarious. hahaha. Then I came home and watched tv and ate dinner and did all the boring everyday stuff then i got tired and took an hour long nap because last night i didn't go to sleep til 2:30 and then i woke up at 8:00. Not a fun thing to do. So everyone's going on the virginia trip tomorrow and i want to go too, but no can do because i went to kure. I'll go next year though.   The picutre thingy at mr. bill's house is on august 8 at 3:00. Well, my flight doesn't come in to charolette until like 4:50, then i have to drive from charolette to columbia so i don't think i'll be able to come at all which really pisses me off, so i'm trying to get my dad to get me an earlier flight. I hate the stupid airlines they're just dumb. I also hate being bored. I got home from my g-parents and i as so bored i was aobut to go crazy. I've GOT to do summer reading, but i keep on putting it off. I'm thiking maybe i should just say screw reading the book, bomb the test, and then work my ass off to pull my grade up. what do you think? Well that's all folks. g'nite-  Liz
