It's just my way to keep track of what goes on in my life since I'm not too good at it. Haha, I'm ridiculous. Yesterday I got to see Tyler and play which made me very happy because one thing I'm sure of is that he's leaving for Canada tommorow...I'm such a sad girl. Oh well, he's supposed to be back the 11th so I have something to look forward to. It's sobad that he's the only thing I can ever thing towrite about...it's become an obsession...but some obsessionsyou just can't avoid and I think hes definetly ok to be obsessed with. I saw Stacey yesterday too which was definetly a cool thing because she hasn't came around since December or so...but she took us to the mall and I got the new TBS cd...which is excellent for those of you who haven't heard it (it's so pathetic that I pretend I'm writing to people...lol) and I got RHPS and ATHF Vol. 1 and 2 on DVD so I'm set for a while. Then we went to DQ for some ice cream...yum. K-Woody called me last night and wants us to go to the Charleston fair today so I'm getting ready...to go get ready for that lol. It could be ok I guess, town fairs aren't too bad sometimes...but that's where I'll be today. As of tomorrow, and this weekend, and until the 11th, I'll wander about aimlessly trying to find something to do as I await the return of Tyler...and Lloyd...HAHA...ok, but as of now, I'm going to go get ready. Bye!
