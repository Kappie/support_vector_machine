My liver was tappin' out because from last Thursday until yesterday I had drank to black out / tears /mega-bad hangover 3 times.  Thats B A D.  I spent all of last Friday at work running to the toilet to puke at least once every twenty minutes.  I woke up for work still drunk.  Wednesday night of this week I lost my f'n mind and I realized I have no control.  I got 4 hours of sleep after a raging-lunatic-scream-fest on my part.  (Sorry to all those who had to look after me and deal with my insanity).  I dunno.  I think I need to chill out for a lil while on drinking...either that or maybe I should stop drinking 2 half and half pint glasses of gatorade and absolut in an hour...after three drinks at the bar before that.  Cinco de Mayo is coming so there is prolly a tequilla-fueled bootfest in my near future.  I dunno, I feel mad guilty about all of this and I don't think I even did anythign *that* wrong.  Hmmm...  On a happier note:  I gave work defintive notice that I'm leaving July 30th to be back at school full time.  Thats a Friday so you all better be ready to get into the city to get your kareoke/dance/party on to celebrate my freedom.  The aggrivation of this job: gone.  The decent pay check: gone (which sucks) but I'll be able to make it.  Its an interesting day, kids.
