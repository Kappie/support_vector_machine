I wanted a links thing so I can link back to people who link to me (::coff:: writers revolution ::coff::). Plus Deb and Erica's Xanga's could be a good read as well. If anyone wants me to link to them then just tell me cause I'm too lazy to go around to all your Xanga/Blog things and do it. And the comments system is down... again. Dave if you could, can you e-mail me the code thingy for comments cause the comments site is on the fritz and it's not giving the code. Thanks a bunch. x0x
