(just so we don't have any confusion) oh yeah i meant to do this at the beginning :  mood:  blah  music:  none...really...Ambiance of the lab? i can tell you what's stuck in my head though....well obviously it's the Lit song. and then the cure, and for a while jewel.....yeah. it goes a little something like this:  i can't remember what was said or what you threw at me, please tell me, please tell me why.... i brush my teeth i put the cap back on, i know you hate it but i leave the light on. i read the paper it was more bad news, more hearts being broken more ppl being used. put on my pjs and i hop into bed, i'm half alive but i feel mostly dead.  i try to tell myself it'll be alright. i really shouldn't think anymore tonight. cause.. i want to love you more...ooo ooo ooo  anyways. today i didn't have to go the processing lab, which is fine and dandy with me, it is so fucking hot in the big suit thingy. grr. and the work is so tedious. but what i had to do today was even more tedious if that is possible. i had to sit and grind 'specimen' (otherwise known as fucking pieces of plastic) into their proper sizes.  yeah. that's right. we're talking millimeter precision. -_-; did you know there is a tasnia.com? and all it says on there is welcome to tasnia.com. kind of queer. haha. i wonder who did that.  wouldn't it be sad if it were me? and i just didn't remember? wait. don't you have to pay for an address like that? i  sure didn't pay for any of that kind of shit. is cursing allowed on this site...? well...it should be...if it's all about expression and such. i think i had other things to say, but at present i can't recall any of it. it's hot as a motherfucker. i'm glad i wore sunscreen. haha. now i won't get cancer! yay! but seriously, i don't burn. i just get tanner and darker and darker...i remind myself of a caramel sundae. *thinks about what she just wrote* uh...hell..what is the point in taking it back? i've already said it. my stupidity just seems to increase with age. i swear i was sharper when i was younger. should we list all the stupid things tasnia has done so far in her life? no we shouldn't...it would take to long...  and stupid is often synonymous with embarrassing. so yeah-no.  i guess you learn...kind of. and get experienced. let's just say tasnia this, i guess, past year has become, uh... somewhat... more experienced. *sigh* does stupid also go with illegal...yes...sometimes. nothing major gosh. it's not like i'm a drug dealer. more like sneaking out and stealing the padres car...just things i didn't i'd do. but i am. and enjoying the hell out of it. it's neccessity. what can i say? i think that's enough for now.
