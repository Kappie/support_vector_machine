Obviously, if there is no ginger in the recipe, use good sense and estimate.  Or, for better result, overestimate.   This weekend has been particularly inspiring.  I'm not at all sure why, to be honest, but it's really been a relief.  I've done a lot of painting and recently, some writing, and I made my way through the rest of the Pullman book I've been reading.     And I've blogged three times, which is probably a record for me, this blog has been neglected for months.  In any case, I feel very revitalized and ready to have my spirits beaten back down to acceptable levels by Kelley and Imresek for the next few weeks.  Summer is becoming visible though, and that seems to shed new light on everything.
