Most of the people on the ship go to this resort so it gives everyone chance to hang out off the boat. When we arrived we jumped in the pool and swam up to the bar to order our favorite - pina coladas. We stretched out in the stone pools inside the pool and just sat there. We vegged and did nothing but soak up the sun and hang.  A few minutes after we got there Lisa saw the guy she is dating and his friend Pantelis. So the four of us hung out and played volleyball and drank. Well, most of the time it was the three of them hanging as I wanted to just lay out in the sun.  Nonetheless, it was fun and relaxing.  My friend E-tie came and hung outwith me for a bit. He is from Israel and we just sat there talking about what brought us to the ships, how long we were both here, etc. etc.   I got back to the boat about 4:00 and my mobile was already ringing when I walked in my room. Bother, work again. I am now back in the office. I got some sun so that was cool.   Tonight is ladies night in the crew bar and supposedly everyone is supposed to go because we all need to have a girls night. I personally don't feel like it after being out in the sun today. I want to finish what work I have, eat some food and check out a movie - wonder if that will happen. Hehehe.  More soon. Shelly
