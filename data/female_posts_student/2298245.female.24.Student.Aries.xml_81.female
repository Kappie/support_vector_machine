       
      I know I said I was going to post lots today, but I perhaps underestimated the amount of time I was going to have to devote to my great Tax adventure.  But tomorrow, after my exam, I will be devoting my time to studying something much less strenuous, so perhaps then I will have time to devote to the blog.  Until then...pray for me, for I will most certainly need it.
