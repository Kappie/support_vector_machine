You don't happen to know their names, do you? (This question only applies if they were B-wood cops).  Also, As I Survey the Wonderous Cross is absolutely amazing.  Must commend you on that version.  You would make wesley or whoever it is that wrote that song very proud.  (Quite frankly, I like your version better.  The other goes REALLY slow.)
