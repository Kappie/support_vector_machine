I felt really awful, because yesterday I was helping Aden and Abner with their videos for Spanish, and Aden's went well to start with, and then Abner came out, and found my house on the second try, after returning to retrive his map.  And his was going well, until the tape ended, and the battery died twice.  Well the problem solver that I am, I'm thinking.  No problem, we'll just tape before Aden's video, and it'll be no problem.  Bad idea.  I taped over and small scene of his, although he still got his video in on time.  Abner however had more difficulties, and in the process of transfering his, the machine ate the tape, and it was unusable.   So he had to reshoot his whole movie today, and he was editing it, as I left school.  Poor guy.  it's rough.  Mrs. Evil Spanish Lady better not dock him points, but she would be in character if she did.   In other news, I found a Marilyn Monroe time line, which makes my social presetation preparation much easier. So much for today.  Back to my homework.
