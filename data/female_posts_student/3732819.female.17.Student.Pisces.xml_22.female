Richard actually called me...surprisingly....cause he was a player type...at least he seemed like it...but he called me and asked me to meet up with him...and so i did...told my mother that i'm going to the "gym" and i met up with him at like 6:30....and we hung out till like 9....it was so much fun....he was a total doll...cause he said that he'd treat me to dinner...we went to Demities instead....yummy! we got a black velvet and pink slips...so yum...and so much fun with the whippedcream;) tee hee *blush* yeah...he was super yum....yeah...blonde hair blue eyes nice gorgeous toned arms, and nice football build...but another thing that he got was a lotta scars...although he hates them and he was cute and kept hiding them but to be honest i found that damn hot...i dunno...guys and scars makes them seem so much more dangerous....tee hee i got a nice little massage from him *blush* yeah...i dunno....i had a lot of fun though....too bad he's a smoker....he had like 3 ciggys while we were together....but he only had half of the ciggy....so he had like one and a half ciggy....i dunno....he's a total player but another thing was that kinda freaks me out about him is that he has a REALLY bad temper...like REALLY bad...he gets into fights on a daily basis....hence all the scars that he's got all over his arms...but he's like the kinda guy that is my type...like the bad boy type ya know? smoker, fighter, and we asked each other all these questions i dunno....but yeah....*shurg* before ileft (which i didn't wanna only cause mystupid mom called and asked me to come home)he asked if he could call me again and i said of course you can, and hes like alright i definitly will call you...and gave me a nice long kiss....yeah...so me superb happy:) cloud nine baby! Blah blah, i know i'm stupid, whorey, sluttyand whatever, i did kiss him...and i dunno...like i knew he had a girlfriend so i guess its his decision on whether or not he'd cheat...anyways we were eatingat demetries and he asked me again if i had a bf and i said no we JUST broke up like yesterday, and he's like yeah yeah i know what you mean, me too...she came to my house and grabbed all her stuff and left....which i was 100% sure he wasn't telling teh truth...but its just i remember him talking to one of his friends about it...and he said something to his friend about his girlfriend going to his house and leaving last night...so i'm not really sure...either way i went with him still having a gf...but then we ate and we talked more and more and after we decided to go for a walk, which was fun....i think we walked around the amc complex about 15 times....but anyways yeah...we would be talkinga nd walking in the middle of the road, and he's a little oblivious and when i saw a car come i would pull his arm to the side with me so the car could pass and when i did that he'd give me a flirty look like " ohhhh" sorta thing ya know? so i said to him "i'm pulling you aside cause i dont' want you to get hit by a car!" and obviously as a guy he said something macho "no, no car would hit me" and then he said "anyways i should be protecting you" and he grabbes my hand and he like covers my body and says "woah woah car, woah, woah i better cover you" and then he didn't let go of my hand....instead he got more comfy with it...like a better position. So we kept walking around holding hands and what not...and we went down that wooden ramp close to Alice Fazzoolies...and we went like a quarter of the way down and he slows down and he pulls me in....and like he was so sweet cause he started like nosing (not sure if thats a word) and then he kissed me....i didn't stop it...lol i couldn't....well i could....but i didn't wanna...i wanted to kiss him since i first saw him hell! he has the hottest lips int he world!! So yeah...we would walk a little and kiss a little along the way....so yeah....meh, he's a player type but whatever....the good thing about him is that he's got his life pretty set...like he works for his dad, but not one of those "because your my son" sorta deals....he actually WORKS for his money....he gets paid the same amount as the other mechanics there....so he's a hard worker, he's got a lot of qualifications and he's already got his own apartment house sorta thing, with his own cars and stuff like that...so yeah...but oh wells....i guess we'll have to see now wont' we?:) anyways, i'm not too serious about this guy so its all good...he's just a friend...with a little bit of benefits....lol *blush* but yes i challenged himm and i said that he doesn't know where i live and that he couldn't look it up because when my car was getting fixed it was put under my moms name and she uses her madien name which he doesn't know...and then he says that he'll just look under my car model....and i was like aw fuck! lol and he says dont' be surprised if i show up at your house;) and yeah....so thats my ranting on Richard....so yes....i guess we shall see shant we? Although i did find something about myself too...he asked many questions....and if my questions were i don't know he'd try it out on me to see if i'd like it...but to be honest i think whatever he did i would like it anyways....its all good...he's definitly got his moves, and thank god for those sexy lips...okay i must leave before i drool all over my keyboard!!
