I went shopping with Sarah today it wasnt really shopping b/c I didnt get anything for myself I just had to get Keith a birthday present although he prolly doesnt deserve one but I feel bad.  I also got to see Lindsay who I missed so much.  Tomorrow I get to go play bball in the morning and then go to the guys bball game and then out to eat with the group or atleast lindsay and sarah I dont care who else goes I would just perfer some individuals not to go but what can you do?......kick their butt....:)  j/k I am a good kid at times.  I finally went into town to buy my Alvarado sticker to go on the back of my explorer it was so much fun to put it on there.  I am officially a teenager with an alvarado sticker on my explorer I love it.  Well that was my day I hope you had a good day actually I dont really care.    Jess
