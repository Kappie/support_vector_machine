It was definitly great to see my friends and to meet new ones!  Im so happy I finally got to see them!  This year at camp really made me see how strong my friendship was with some of my greater friends!  I mean dont get me wrong I love them no matter what but I did get tested quite a bit that week!  I learned alot about God too!  I didnt even begin to think of how we are all in a battle right now!  Not just our troops in Iraq or any others for that fact!  We are in a battle against satan and God is our leader ,our colonel if you will!  I never would have thought to put it in that context!  I think it was the hardest to leave this year because I totally realized alot this past week!  It was very hard leaving Madison and Taylor and Meagan!  It was especially hard to leave Leah!  By the way I wrote a new poem mainly for Leah and Madison but its to all my friends too!  Its not good at all to me but Ive heard it was pretty good!  I dont know!  I think I cried the most this year and I hate crying!  I just hate it when you are in the reality of the world and just when I feel like Im gonna blow!  I go to church camp and it all just comes together and Im finally able to be in a christian atmosphere!  I can relate to all these people with at least one thing and thats the love I have for God!  I get close to God and just when it seems I could stay in this wonderful place forever its time to leave and go back to that horrible place we call the real world!  Some can be good but most things that are going on around me arent what God wants and I hate that!  Well to sum this camp week up, I had fun, learned alot, got tested alot, and made greater realationships with my old and new friends!  Right after I left camp I went straight to Temple to play some SOFTBALL!  Well sorda I sat that game!  It stunk but its ok I played the whole game the last 2!  That day was extremely hard because the night before I went to bed at 3 and got up at 7 in the morning!  Well I had a softball game at 11:30 that night and lets just say it went into extra extra innings!  HA!  Well I ended up going to bed at 2:45 the next morning!  Then we had to get up at 9 that morning to play another game at 11!  Then we played another at 5!  It was alot of fun but I cried some more when I lost the game for my team!  Let me just say that there was a girl on third and we had 2 outs!  It was 2-2 and pitcher throws a fastball a little outside but I swing and it barely hits the bat but its fair!  I run as fast as I can to first and Im about 4-5 feet away when I see the ball out of the corner of my eye going right into the 1st basemans glove!!  IM OUT!!!!  It ends 4-5 in the 10th inning!  UGH I WANTED TO BE THE HERO!!!  Its not as much of the fact that I didnt hit the ball good or that I got out!  Its the fact that I let my whole team down!  Anyways we were out of the tournament!  That night I went out with Janaye, Jenna, Daniel, Danny, Mrs. Julianne, my niece, my mom, step dad, Moni, Molly, Meagan, and John to eat at El Chico!  We ate and talked and had a good time and then we went to get ice cream!  Then we came back to the hotel and got on the computer!  (well other people did I didnt get the chance) Then we had to leave and I went to bed and the next day we came home!  The past 2 days have been boring except I had softball practice yesterday!  I also got in a fight with this girl named Amberly because she came up to the softball field to hit with this girl Katie and her dad and no body on my team likes her! She is nice to me but Im not mean to her!  Well we got in a fight because they were talking about her at practice and she wanted to know what they said and I wouldnt tell her b/c Im not like that!  Well I better go b/c this is really long and I could probably go on forever!  GOD BLESS YALL!!
