Well here's there band's webby, they wouldn't let my brother in cause he lead guitarist was jelous or something!  urlLink http://www.lifesentence.freewire.co.uk/  Oh and then their's the Mr Zippy (a band) web site and my brother knows them too! Hehe, it's funny to see them so serious though!  urlLink http://www.mrzippy.co.uk/  So any way... I got up really late today then had a "Oh my god what to wear" thing, but I'm ok now! (Yeah, I am wearing something!) Mmm better change the thought! Oh and Valvados I haven't blocked you! No one's blocked! I just sign out when I go on this so people don't bug me! We have to go shopping in Bristol ok?! Hey I'm gonna go shop on Amazon cause I've got £15 to spend from people... so they don't have to give me money! Aha! Manga here I come!
