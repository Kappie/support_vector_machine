If there are women out there that need money and are willing to earn it having sex then let them. The same goes for the horny men that have or need to buy sex to get it. What is so unfair about this? I feel nothing. I think that the government just makes it illegal because they know that it is still going to happen no matter what and this way they can collect money from fines.  This is allowed in Nevada. How under one constitution can different states make up their own laws? What would be wrong with having some more bunny ranches?  This is allowed in gentlemens clubs no matter which way you look at it. I guess people just think that they are just "dancers" but how is going into a special room or a "VIP" room any different. You are still charged more to do what you please at their discretion. Paying for sex is paying for sex, no matter if you are a whore, a horny bastard, at a bunny ranch, or at a gentlemens club.  We all know that sex is an industry in itself, if you know what I mean. We have all heard the phrase sex sells, so what's wrong with selling sex?  Would love to hear comments on this one. I am a firm believer with this topic. There will always be those diseases out there no matter what we do, and realistically we wont stop having sex, even if it kills us.
