I never realized how often I have a beer when we are hanging out or a glass of wine with dinner. It didn't really help that cute boys were putting it in my face saying "awe come on you want some!" Yes I do but I will not!  Anyways: I realize I haven't blogged all weekend so I have so much to share.. well not really but it is cool to me. 1. My room is on the 10th floor and there is a parking garage out my window so I can see the top which is open and Saturday morning I looked out and there was a police car sitting there all by itself. I thought it was strange but maybe he had taken someone to their car and was doing something but when I looked back ten minutes later he was still there. I thought he could be doing two things... taking a nap or abusing his authority. I think he was taking a nap because it was almost 30 minutes later before he left. I fought the impulse to call the police and ask if there was something wrong and get him in trouble but now I know to look out for him.  2. I am officially roomie less for the time being. I know of one girl who is moving and I am really hoping that she moves somewhere else. Not that she isn't nice but man I like drying my hair in my room in the morning. I was a little sad to see my roomie leave. She was a really nice lady but not what you want in a roomie while in college. I would come home at midnight and she would ask if I had been reviewing. I would just say yeah. But there was a going away party for her and I meet some nice people in the community and supposedly a couple is going to call me and have me out for dinner. They have a son around my age so who knows it may work out alright. Plus its great to have someone fix a meal for you.  3. I had the best intentions to do work this weekend but somehow I only got done what was due today so I would say that I am going to work hard this week but we all know that I will just manage to slip by. I would like to thank my sis for being a great distraction and talking to me for over an hour each day while I was in my office. Its great when someone gives you a way to be distracted instead of having to make your own.  Well that's all for me for today but I am going to be having dinner with the boys that were at Sangria Spectacular on Thursday so hopefully I will have something great to report back.
