I deserve for  him  to hate me and never talk to me, but of course thats not what I want. In the perfect world,  he'd  forgive me eventually and  we'll  live happily ever after. But I think  hes  just confused now, so I'll give  him  time. I don't think  he'll  ever read this, but  kevin  I love you so much, please just be happy, even if  your  happiness doesn't include me, just knowing  your  happy is all I want. I love  you  so much  baby .
