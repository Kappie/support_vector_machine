I miss everyone sooo much. I'm IMing Chelsea so hopefully she'll tell me if we do or not. or, I could just call Greg and ask him. Yeah, thats probably what I'm gonna have to do. Me and Drew talked until 5 this morning... so I was dead tired. Oh well, it was WAY worth it. I like him alot... and I think I am falling in love with him. He makes me feel all happy and stuff inside. I like that feeling. I'll post later on about the church situation...
