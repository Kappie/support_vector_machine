I'm totally losing my voice though. I don't care, it's all worth it. I love my friends. They're like, the coolest people I know. I know that sounds really corny, but I don't honestly give a damn. Besides, I swallowed too much pool water today, do you honestly expect me to make sense?!  There's only one thing that's bringing me down right now. Some people just can't take a hint. Some people just don't know when to drop something, to let it be, to move on. Oh well, I had too much of a good day to really let it get to me, so for now I'll take it with a good humored shrug and an attempt to aid the situation. Oh well, it's all good.  Good night, sweet prince. May we meet again some day.
