I have many memories of that place and will always remember the good and bad times that were had there. The last of the apartment was packed up last Sunday and carted over to my mom’s place. It was very strange to stand in the empty living room and look into the empty kitchen. I grew so used to seeing it filled with a collections of old papers and magazines, tons of DVD’s/ CD’s, everything that was either placed into storage or in the garage of my mom’s house. It looked and smelled the same as it did 2 years and 3 months earlier. It was just a strange feeling to be there again, but this time without Jesse by my side.   In other news, Jesse is doing ok He found out earlier this week that the training he did, the 3 weeks in Arizona, were for nothing and now they aren’t going to be able to use the equipment they got trained on. This really bummed Jesse out, he was mad because they made him and 3 other guys, leave 2 weeks before the rest of his unit to do this special training and now it was all for nothing. You all can imagine how pissed Jesse was. He said that the military took 2 weeks away from him that he could have spent home with me. Everything was just cut so short and last minute. But what do you expect from the ARMY? Other than that he is doing good.   In other news, next week I start school again. I am taking a bunch of Early Childhood Education classes, to help me pass the time away. I am looking forward to this, going back to school and getting back into the swing of things. Last semester I took home classes so I wasn’t at the campus, it was sort of my way of taking time off from school, but not taking a semester off. It will be great to get back to school and keep my mind busy. TTYL
