There was a quote in Win A Date...that I liked "Love you get over with in two months. Big love- 2 years. And great love, well great love changes you life forever." Or something like that. Well, I know for sure that for me, it wasn't just love because it's been two months. Eh, whatever, life goes on and everyday is one step closer to truely being happier. (Maybe?)  So I went to see my grandma Hoover today. It's the first time I've seen her since she went into the nursing home. I feel so sad when I think about things like that so I'm not going to talk about it anymore.  In a little while I'm going to my other grandma's house for pizza with my mom, Emily, my grandma, aunt, and Paige. Should be a blast (not). Well, atleast I get pizza out of the deal.  I really don't want to go to school tomorrow. I would do anything to get out of ever having to go again.  Right now, I'm just listening to HIM and realizing how much of a friggen loser I am and how boring my life has become. Oh well, nothing I can really do to change that. I choose to stay home and not go out because I don't want to see anyone so I guess it's my fault.  Song:  The world was on fire, no-one could save me but you It's strange what desire will make foolish people do I'd never dreamed that I'd need somebody like you And I'd never dreamed that I'd need somebody like you     No I don't wanna fall in love this world is always gonna break your heart   No I don't wanna fall in love this world is always gonna break your heart ..with you   What a wicked game to play    To make me feel this way    What a wicked thing to do    To let me dream of you    What a wicked thing to say  You never felt this way  What a wicked thing you do  To make me dream of you     No I don't wanna fall in love this world is always gonna break your heart  No I don't wanna fall in love this world is always gonna break your heart ..with you  The world was on fire, no-one could save me but you It's strange what desire will make foolish people do No and I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you I'll never dream that I lose somebody like you, no  Now I wanna fall in love This world is always gonna break your heart Now I wanna fall in lust This world is always gonna break your heart ..with you  Nobody loves no-one -Wicked Game- HIM ---oh, how true...
