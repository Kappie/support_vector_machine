Mrs Stoner ( ex-tutor teacher) came up to me after school and said ashley wats wrong you look down and I told her why and she offered her shoulder to cry on basically and that is great because she is just lovely.           On a happier note today at lunch 2 me and karl were playing on this skateboard we found and kept fallin off it was awesome! lol I guess you are all thinking F**k your dumb! Yea I knew you were. I got a txt from ed so yay i guess.     i also played badminton tonight it is gay but meh i dont really care.     I wont my single 15-13 or sumthin and me and JennyJ lost our doubles but who cares lots? You do? Oh well you will live I am sure.     I guess that is about it. must fly as dinner is nearly ready.     PEACE and out
