My family and I went to The Philippines last year.. and we bought lots of packets of M's and blocks of Cadbury's (as heaps of Filipino-Australians do when they plan to go to The Phils.. quality chocolate and stuff is apparently expensive over there, so we bring 'pasalubong' for our Filipino relatives)... I remember my mom and I went to that supermarket at like, 10PM! And he served us... and he was really nice, I could've melted on the friggin' supermarket floor.. And he wished us well and aahhh... So that was one week before we left for The Phils... October! So the last time I saw him before the party was...*counts on fingers*.. OMG 10 MONTHS AGO?!!  I wish I could remember these things on demand, and not so spontaneously...
