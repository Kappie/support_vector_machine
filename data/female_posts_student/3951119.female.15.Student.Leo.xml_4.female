Never made it over to the Gravitron thing...but there was the Zipper, I love that ride. Didn't break the record of 7, but we spun upsidedown 6 times. Just one away!!! And then this other ride I went on twice, same song both times, but it's a good song. I like it. "...cause I'm breaking down, this picture is frozen and I can't get out..." aa...I need to find the lyrics. *grins* and this other ride...aa...I like seeing the entire world upside down now and then, but for so long and so often? It was fun anyway. The wait was awful though, because I convince myself it's going to be scary as Hades and then try to convince myself it won't be, and the unconvincing never works. hehehe. But now my arms are sore because of the restraints they have to keep you from falling out. *sighs* ouch. And the Zipper needs more padding. aa...But enough complaining. I had a lot of fun. That was part of my B-day present, mom said. The dinner and the rides. And then my cape. aa...*grins* I can't wait for that to get here. And OE is too hyper. I keep having to go back and retype everything because I start typing too fast. CALM DOWN, darn it!!! CALM!!! *sighs* aa...hyper people...*grins and goes bouncing off the walls*
