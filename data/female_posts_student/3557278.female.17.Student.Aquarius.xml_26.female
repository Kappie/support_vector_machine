He was a jerk to me therefore he can go to hell.  I don't agree with 99.9% of what my dad says, of course thats my problem because i'm only 17 therefore my opinion doesnt matter... im trying to make things tolerable for all involved but im not going to deliberately start shit (not that i do).   I'm going to be a nurse. I'm going to go to UTS and i can get the UAI i need - (81.35). Yay, i'm goint  urlLink HERE . woot!  I can reverse park.. oh yeah watch out :P (which my shoulder doesnt like too much). Anyway, hopefully i can get the physio to check it (my shoulder, not the reverse parking lol, and the more exercises i do, the stronger it will get.  Oh, and it's the long weekend :) Watching parramatta play on sunday, yay!
