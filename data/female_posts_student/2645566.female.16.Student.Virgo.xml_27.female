I just wasn't really conscious of what I was saying, and that's not ever good. When I finally got my lazy butt out of bed I remembered that I had to get my pictures taken today. Now how can someone forget that? I don't know. So I did some wash. Oh, I should probably mention that I was babysitting. So, I'm doing wash, watching kids, and making sure they don't make a mess while they make lunch. Then I have to start getting ready to leave. The little heathens decided that since I was a little bit preoccupied that they could do whatever the heck they wanted. BIG MISTAKE ON THEIR PART. So now I'm doing wash, watching kids, making sure they don't make a mess (in general), trying to get ready for my 2:00 appointment for senior pictures in Manchester, and trying to control the mongrouls. By the time that I was FINALLY ready to leave I had to turn around and come back because I forgot my clarinet. Then I got caught at a train. Here comes the part that I am   so   happy about. My freakin car broke down again! By the time that I finally got to my grandparents house, my car had died twice. And I still had to go to Manchester! It died two more times before I even got out of Tullahoma. It dies when I go fast, it dies when I go (period), and it now dies when I slow down!! I have to say that the best part of my day was when I was getting the pictures taken (which took a whopping 2 and a half hours)...except the fact that my mom didn't come like she was supposed to. Then I came home. My car *only* died 2 times by the time that I got home. It's been a long day. My car won't get looked at until Thursday at the soonest, and band camp is on Friday. Oh poo...I just found out that I'm going to have *another* kid to watch tomorrow. I think I need a break.  God Bless.
