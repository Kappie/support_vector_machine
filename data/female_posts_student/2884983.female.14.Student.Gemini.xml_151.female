But this is my life currently: Today I am going to Pitt to go camping in Manning Park with my Krystal and co. Yay. My stepgrama is dying and when I get back from Pitt they expect her to be dead. I finished reading one of the most amazing series in my life. I havent been sleeping well so I am exhausted. My riding was cancelled this morning due to rain. I have no books to read and I cant go to the library. On the bright side I have no other news.
