I won three awards in my division, which is Varsity. I won a Third place In Science, Botany *cringe*, and two seconds in Music and Art. It was all very surprising. My coach was giving out the awards, and, when he announced the science award, he said, "She's going to faint." I very nearly did; I was so beyond stunned. I guess it just proved how low the scores were. I got a 500 out of a 1000 possible. Really low scores. I don't know how I did for music and art.   However, I know I personally sucked at speech, half my fault and half the fault of a bitch. You see, what happened is that I didn't have my speech as well memorized as I should've, so I stumbled a bit. My fault and I take full responsibility for my lack of responsibility. But the other part was that the timer didn't do her job. She was supposed to hold up the cards telling me how much time I had left, but she never did. She sat there trying to poke her eye out with a pen the whole time, an endeavor I wished she had succeeded in, and she didn't hold them up! So I was left there with a few sentences left in my speech, thinking I had gone horribly fast. So I started to stall. Then the damn buzzer went off! GAH!!! It makes me so angry. Then the bitch had the nerve to try and apologize to me, which I tried to accept politely, so that the judges wouldn't really kill me, but I might just kill her in Spanish class tomorrow. Other than that, my part in the scrimmage went off without a hitch. I'm angry at myself for not winning anything in Literature which is my strong suit, and I'll study the poetry better, because I know that was what got me.   Well after I died of shock. My friends and I went out bowling, which was just plain awesome. My first game rocked, my second sucked so badly that I rolled a gutter ball and it hit the pin collector thing. I had fun  though, so that's what counts.  Today has been boring with the exception of one thing. I had another political argument with a guy I happen to like. We always fight like this, and I happen to like it, despite the fact that he always wins, but that's not always what makes an argument great. In my opinion, a good argument is one which makes you think, and he always gives me that. So now I'm thinking about what he said, and he's starting to make me question my political standings. I don't like Bush, I never will, because I just can't respect a man that has no respect for me as an atheist. A Texan Christian is definitely not someone who loves all people no matter their religious creed, and his speeches, despite being written by someone else, clearly show his religious affiliation, and I hate hearing the religious undercurrent in every one of his speeches. It's really not right.  Bush's foreign policy was also one  of those things I never liked, but he's getting me thinking that, though I may dislike open war, maybe it was necessary for the people of Iraq. But then again, has this war made these people's lives any better? Are they really free now? I don't think  so, and maybe I'll talk about that to him later, most likely to be shot down, but I like the debate.   Ah well, that was my weekend, and I suppose I should talk more often... Anyway, back to thinking. Damn him, I was enjoying my brain being mush for today.
