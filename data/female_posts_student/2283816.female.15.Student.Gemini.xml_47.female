She's beautiful. There is no one prettier than Catherine Zeta-Jones. I promise.  Guh - well, today I wrote a Tzeitel fic. Rather exhausting. But it was about if she had been forced to marry Lazar Wolf instead of Motel. I love this girl to death though, so it sucked doing it to her. But it was an idea I've had for awhile. Just ask if you want to see it.   Nothing is going on! I need to do something. Bleh. Life is sooo very dull. I think it's the absence of Michael/Hillary. And the fact that somebody should be calling me on the phone and hasn't yet and I'm starting to go into aortic fits of heartbeatingfasterfasterfaster every time the damn thing rings. Please call; at this point, the suspense is killing me and GAH!!!
