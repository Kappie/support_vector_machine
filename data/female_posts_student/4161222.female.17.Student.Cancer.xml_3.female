It's like...if you go without sex for a LONG time, when you do it again it's an "Oh my God" experience.  Well, it's the same for me and my No Doubt CDs.  Anyways, nothing much going on today.  I'm babysitting right now, and the boys and I are probably going to hit up the mall today.  I'm getting a little excited for school to start again, but I'm also really nervous about seeing my ex-boyfriend.  I haven't seen Brenton (Buggy) since...well, since school ended.  It's just been really, really, really different this summer.  I don't mean that like it's been bad, just different.  Last summer, Buggy and I were together for the whole summer, going right into school.  Now I'm with Randy, and he's not going to be there for me everyday (not that he doesn't want to be there, just with him living in Montvile, being 19, my strict parents, ect...we're not going to be seeing each other as much).  I don't want anything to end between us, but more than that, I don't want to be with him as school starts, be totally content, and in a few weeks hear him say, "I met this really great girl in one of my classes."  Ugh.  That would be  urlLink total devestation.   We discussed this briefly last night, but once again, no real progress was made concerning everything.  We are walking on eggshells.  There's stuff we just won't discuss because we're afraid it's going to spark conflict and fighting.  And it's really sad, when a relationship has to be like that, but what can I do?  Every time we try to have a "talk," things get about 93824793287 times worse.  It should be really easy.  I like him, he likes me.  End of story, right?  WRONG.   Relationships are, unfortuantely, not that easy.  I wish they were.
