(oh please josh dont get angry again if youre reading this..) him saying that he was unhappy about another guy making me better.. it made me feel like hes the only one im supposed to talk to, like i shouldnt have friends, he should be enough for me. josh means so much to me, dont get me wrong, but i do have other people that i talk to besides him.  ~~>but anyway.. after that we kind of just talked for about twenty minutes, both of us apologizing again and again. then i said something to make him really upset.. not even going to go into that.. but we ended up fighting for another twenty minutes. it was pretty intense..  ~~>then he told me he gave himself a little "reminder".. -->juggalopimpjosh (1:07:09 AM): i did it because i was mad at myself for being like that since i was jealous that guy made you feel better and i didn't , i did it to remind me that i don't want to treat you like that again -->juggalopimpjosh (1:09:26 AM): baby , im sorry  -->ymcm8 (1:09:39 AM): its ok.. -->juggalopimpjosh (1:10:28 AM): no it not  -->juggalopimpjosh (1:11:12 AM): i have treated you so bad and you should be treated a lot better then i have tonight -->juggalopimpjosh (1:13:07 AM): meggie i love you but i am not sure what to do next -->ymcm8 (1:13:27 AM): i love you.. he loves me.. =)  ~~>so after that we.. uhh.. talked for a little while more. he made a journal and talked about how he felt about me and our fight. i left this comment for him: -->hey joshua,  sexyboyjosh eh? you are sexy. and cute. =) makes me wanna eat you all up..  i need pictures of your sexyness. =Ãž ima print out your sexyness and tape it on my wall so i can look at it every single night. =)  im so sorry about tonight. i know that it was my fault because of what i said, and i really wish that i could take it back. i know it hurt you so much and i didnt mean to hurt you. i love you so much. i really hope that we can get past this and be like before.. i dont wanna lose you.  --meggie  ~~>and then he said: -->Hey baby ,  thanks for your comment , i hope we can get past it too, i don't want to lose you either . I love you megan , I hope we can be like before and maybe please each other soon .   meggie i know you didn't mean to hurt me but you did hurt me and it going to take some time . baby i will get you that pictures soon .  night baby i love you so much .  josh ::sighs:: isnt he the best? =)   ~~>i hated fighting with him so much, and i  know he hated it too. it really sucks though because it kind of changed things between us. i know it hasnt even been a week since the fight and we still need more time to get over it, but its so hard. before i never thought that we could fight; everything was so perfect between us. but now i know that it is possible and its just.. different..  ~~>so were trying though. the other night i was so sad and i missed him so much i decided to use scissors - yes, scissors, dont judge me - to, um, put a J in my leg. it worked, lol. it only stayed for like two days though. it still hurts if i push on it. =/  ~~>so i guess ill stop talking now, lol. i didnt know this entry was going to be so long! ive been writing non-stop for 40 minutes. most since.. uhh.. i cant even remember. a looong time. and the south park movie is about to end and ima go to bed after that. kenny is such a cute little kid.. i love seeing him without that little orange hood on his head. =) later journal.
