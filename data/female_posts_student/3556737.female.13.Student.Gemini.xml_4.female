I wanna watch Pirates of the Carribeans (i'm not sure if this is the right spelling of "carribeans", but what the heck). It's a humorous and action film, (i guess). I wanted to watch Shrek 2, too. But i have the feeling we have to wait for it's dvd release, lol. It's okay. DUH!  that's all bu-bye! ...dessa...
