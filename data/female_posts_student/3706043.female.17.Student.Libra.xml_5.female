Courtney you were always there to talk to me and stop me from thinking such bad things about myself.  you always boosted my self-esteem.  I love you so much and i know that i have helped you in return.  Manny you have also helped me.  when i use to talk about it and say that if i did go through with it you would always be the one to say there are people who would miss me and that you are my friend and you would miss me.  it is scary when you stand on the top of something at an amusement park and wish that there were no bars on the edge so you could just jump off.  i know it is scary and i shouldn't think like that but i do.  a lot of the times now a days i believe that if i were gone only a selected few would miss me.  i really hate to think like that but i do.
