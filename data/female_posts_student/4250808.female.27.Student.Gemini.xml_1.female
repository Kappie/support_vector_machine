It didnt turn out that way at all. This morning i was using the computer while Tish was getting ready for work and i opened up the notepad on MY desktop and found saw something called Darling. Of course i was like "whats this?"I opened it and to my total disgust it was a love email from my woman to her ex. It was an old letter but still i didnt need to see that shit. Just 2 days ago i came across saved IM's of theirs. I was furious,sad,and hurt. I called her in and she was just like "oh" like it was no big deal and when she said sorry it was so fake i couldnt even accept it. Now everyone has a past. Myself included i was in love once before but i really feel like her past is always being thrown in my face and it makes me feel so awful.I really feel like i cant express my emotions without her getting mad at me. She had the nerve to ask me why i opened it...... I was like WELLLLL. So anyway that led to a uncomfortable day and me telling her that i wasnt using her computer anymore. I am so tired of seeing shit like that.(another time i came acros naked pics of a different ex) So i went to best buy today and i got my own computer(yea) I was going to wait a few more weeks till i could get the notebook i wanted but i just couldnt imagine using that pc agian. I got a really great deal on a desktop that came with everything. This is my first very own computer!   We talked a little and we both said the same ole things we always say and then things were a little better. We dont have Noah this weekend so it has been a nice break for us and we are both looking forward to sleeping in tomorrow morning.   I love her so much and at times i just dont know if i can be the right gyrl for her.I dont think i have it in me. I am so afraid that i will just keeping taking until i cant take anymore and ill snap. I really dont want that to happen.She really is an amazing woman and we dont really have a lot of problems it is just that the few we do have are BIG. Well i am going to go to bed now. I predict a good night sleep tonight. Wishing for a better day tomorrow.
