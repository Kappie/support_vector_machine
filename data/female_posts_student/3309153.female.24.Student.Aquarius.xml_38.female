It is such a deeply implanted and immovable stone in my belly that it prevents me, even, from accepting the kindness of the most beloved of my acquaintance. Strangers certainly need not attempt. No hope there.  I look around at other people, who easily ask and ask and ask, and then I see them acquire. So, I think I could, too. Because certainly I want things. But I never want in a way that can separate the denial of my object. Wanting is inevitably, for me, all mangled up by the possibility of rejection. A possibility so strong, I had better not take the chance. There is no such thing as rejection if the question goes unasked, if the outstretched palm stays hidden, if vulnerability is masked. I say to daft me.  So, I am good at hiding. All I have to do is avert my eyes and I imagine I am invisible before anything or anyone I don't want to face when they have what I want or need. If I have a thing called a sixth sense, it is to know that as I am hiding from you, you are trying to seek me out. But I will resist. So afraid of what I will see there, what the answer to my request will be. And if I was a right-thinking person, more than what I actually am, I would think--why in the world would anyone work so hard to draw you out if it was going to end in badness? Why would that woman across the room work to smile at you if she was really thinking you're an awful sort of human being? I don't know. But the truth is that I act everyday guided by foolishness such as this. And if I can tell about it/write about it, shouldn't I know better? Shouldn't that mean I'm doing something to mend to get away from that? In the best of all possible worlds it would. Not here, thank you very much. Our sense has gone out to a long lunch. It is sitting at a red light somewhere in town, staring blankly ahead wondering if the body it abandoned is worth returning to. So, I am as I am, until it decides whether it will come back to me. And I will not ask with my eyes or my smile or any discernible thing. Fighting for  me  is work too hard to bother with. Can't dredge up the necessary bravery at key moments where it is the essential thing. If I could just speak or just look or just touch. Just ask. If only, if only...   Oh, but to-night, now, I dare say these things-- I...to you...and you hear them!...It is too much! In my most sweet unreasonable dreams, I have not hoped for this! Now let me die, Having lived. It is my voice, mine, my own, That makes you tremble there in the green gloom Above me--for you do tremble, as a blossom Among the leaves--You tremble, and I can feel, All the way down along these jasmine branches, Whether you will or no, the passion of you Trembling... -Cyrano to Roxane   The   asking   often becomes more the thing than the thing itself. It easily overpowers, for, if it is actually accomplished, I cannot even bear to stay around for the outcome, sometimes. Asking is all because it is too much, all by itself.  I can do it for other people, though. For someone else, I will fight until all fighting passes out of fashion. And then I'll fight some more, because people deserve things--happiness--in life.  Happiness or peace or opportunity should be everyone's due. Everyone like: children, students, the dispossessed, the disenfranchised, the ill-loved, the elderly, the forgotten, the sick, the women, the men, the human beings, the earth. Even the ground I stomp around is more deserving of my advocacy than I myself am. I'm like Cyrano in that way. Christiane deserved a beautiful woman, he thought. And Cyrano used all his powers to win her for him. And Cyrano, as everyone knows, was brilliant. If he could never trust people enough to be better than he expected them to be, how will I ever manage...remember...I am admittedly missing a few key gray cells. This, I fear, will be the sort of thing that finally gets me committed.   That I choose to not ask is always a surprise to me, though. Because most of the time, I talk with no hope for my listener that I might shut up. But there are still times when I retreat into myself, activating my "You-don't-phase-me Girl" armor and walk right past the things that frighten me so that I imagine a trickle running down my inseam forming an awful pool, which I imagine I will also actually drown in, if I face what it is I don't want to face. Ask for what it is I don't dare imagine I deserve.  I do not claim favorites. Often. " 'ardly hever, Mr. Higgins." But if I had to choose a literary character that was me...all the way through...it would be Monsieur le Bergerac. But because people will ask too many questions, I always say Jane Eyre. Or for the past ten months or so Margaret Cadmore (II). But there is something about the gentleman and I that, no matter what I could do to remedy the thing that one would think is the obvious reason I think of him being lodged deep and immovably down in me, I cannot get away from. It must be something else, something I was born with, not learned after having been denied. He is there. Haunting, but not always active. Then when I think, perhaps this time it will be easier...no. I am reminded of who I am. Of him in me.  So I hush.
