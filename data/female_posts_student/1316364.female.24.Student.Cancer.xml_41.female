The sun is shinning But all you seem to see are clouds. How can ignorance  Be the plan  The flowers are now blooming But dead steams are all you crush I try to reach for heaven But its hell you seem to touch  The sun is shinning But all you seem to see are clouds. How can ignorance  Be the plan  A playground where children once played Is now ground covered in glass All of our childhood memories Have been discarded in the trash  The sun is shinning But all you seem to see are clouds. How can ignorance  Be the plan  Ignorance is bliss Ignorance is bliss Ignorance is bliss But blissful people are  truly ignorant
