Listening to:   This American Life    Watching:   Grown Men making asses out of themselves    Mood:   hermit-like   One of the few things that I unequivocally dislike is when stores have men dress up in animal costumes and pester customers. Really, I think if anyone had a desire to dress up in an animal costume, he better be a "plushie" and about to fuck someone up the ass in that costume.   But no, my stroll around Barnes and Noble today was disturbed by "Rusty", an undistinguishable animal mascot for a minor league baseball team in Gary, IN. I had to ignore him as he waved to me when I drove into the parking lot. I looked the other direction as he called out to me as I walked in the store. And I had to walk hurriedly away when he came up and violated my 3-foot personal space radius requirement while I had been browsing through books on a table.   It was like "Rusty" had sensed that I didn't want to be ANYWHERE near him, and then tried desparately to induce a smile and fit of giggles from me. I came to Barnes and Noble to look at BOOKS, not be harassed by a shitty animal mascot. "Rusty" should consider himself lucky that I didn't kick him square in his animal bits.
