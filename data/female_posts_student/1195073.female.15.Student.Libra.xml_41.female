I grabbed this one guy's tit and my cousin grabbed his belt and started whipping him with it. It was good, clean fun. Then we rode in the back of the truck to the Stumble Inn. There were about six of us in the back and three up front. The Stumble Inn. What a place. It was boring, so we left and went back to the party. Almost killed myself doing fireworks. Not fun. But they were pretty. We did some sparklers, but one, like, exploded on me and I got scared.         Heard some pretty interesting things about  JW . It's not actually about him, though, and I'm not too worried about it.       Then I went home and our neighbors dog got out, so I went looking for him, then found him and told my dad to tie him up.
