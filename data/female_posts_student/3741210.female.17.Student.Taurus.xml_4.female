I also got a pair of black and pink converse, a pair of adidas sandals that everyone wears with socks, and a pair of dress pants for the dreaded work.  I may hate the place, but at least I'll dress well.  I watched Dawson's Creek today in the morning.  I love how there's always drama going on every second in Capeside.  There's always someone falling in love, being in love, getting dumped, getting laid, talking about getting laid, or complaining about how so-and-so doesn't notice them.  So much teen angst, so little time.  I think I have to go babysit tonight for my mom and her friend.  They're going to see The Notebook and I'm going to watch Mrs. L.'s kids.  I wish I could go see it instead of staying home.  Maybe I'll go see it tomorrow night to congratulate myself on getting through another day at work.  And maybe I'm being a baby about this whole work thing.  Other kids seem to hold jobs without complaining as much as I do. My brother should be getting home today and he can tell me about it.  I hope we don't have to answer phones because then people will know how absolutely little I know on the subject of title insurance.  What if they yell at me for it? Pray for me...
