I was ditched by two people!! well really only one because i forgave one of the persons.  for their own reasurrance, i will call them Billy and Bob. So... We, meaning Billy, Bob, and me, were having a great friday and we were all hanging out and talking about how we would have a great weekend.  So that night, i had to go out to eat with my family for a birthday, so they said we would hang on Sunday.  i wake up the next morning feeling refreshed and ready to spend the day with Billy and Bob, and so i go down to Billy's house, and she isn't there!  turns out she had to go shopping with her mom and Grandma... and so i decided to go to Bob's house.  when i got there, i found out from a neighbor that Bob was at the beach with her mom and aunt. So i was stuck with the lame neighborhood kids down the street.  How great. i should have called someone else who was also ditched. we could have hung out.  well got to go study for a history exam for tomorrow!  thanks for listening to my boring sob story!  ---Sara
