I have too many clothes.  Karin makes good cheesecake.  Elf is a funny movie.  Andrew looks a whole lot like Ed, stretched out.  Andrew now weighs 141 pounds.  I'm very proud.  Writing disjointed sentences is entertaining.  My life sucks, but it's getting better.  I'm terrible at basketball.  I've grown half an inch since last time I was measured.    WAhoo  My butt, however, is still dead.  It needs to be resurrected.  Goodbye
