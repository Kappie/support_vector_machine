I printed off all my info on Masochist Artforms and Masochist performance Art. I still have to finish transferring notes to note cards, and the writing of my outline must be completed aswell.   Sebastian and I went to Riverside after I put a hold on the whole homework situation. I was great to chill at our old hang out and talk. Talking does a lot when you feel like shit. We made a new Blair Witch friend, Sebastian named him Billy. (Oww!! Carpal Tunnel Syndrome setting in... not fun) Billy is an alien who likes soccer and dancing, he has a dick growing out of his mouth. We left Billy at Frog Island though. And that was the highlight of my day.  I came home to my parking spot finally open and my brother pulling in beside me. Nick (a Kettering friend), Sara, and Eric cooked a dinner for Eric's girlfriend, which I contributed my wonderful meat sauce to, because apparently Eric and Nicole's family are on bad terms. I hope they enjoyed dinner.  At about 5:15 I dropped Sebastian off at his dad's house and then headed to A2 for some moping around the city. I made it a point to not waste the remaining money I had. I ended up driving back to the east side of A2 to get gas then headed back into the downtown area to chill at a coffee house and do homework. I had plans to hang out with Max but those fell through... not surprised. At 9pm I headed back to the parking structure and died halfway up the stairs to the 5th floor, cigarette in hand. I'm such a dumb bitch.   I did have a very unhealthy conversation... no... note that I left Max. I wouldn't be surprised if he never talked to me again. I just hope he's not like most of my old petty friends, by hiding behind a mask and never telling me until the end that he's using me or that I'm naive and dumb and need a life. Which would be the absolute truth. He's going through a lot, so I do understand how quiet moments are sometimes needed. Again, I'm a dumb bitch.   SomethingAshley: hey you SomethingAshley: you there? SomethingAshley: If you don't want to talk/hang-out/etc. with me ever again you can tell me you know? I may be imagining things but I'm pessimistic like that so you get the idea... SomethingAshley: but on the other hand by weird turn of events I do enjoy just hanging out with you. I enjoy more than just hanging out with you, but if you don't particularly feel that way for me (anymore?) that's alright. I just need to get out of the house and into some sort of a normal social life I guess...  SomethingAshley: and I'm really sick and tired of hanging around ignorant idiots that go to my school... Okay, I think I'm just trying to convey to you that you're a extremely great guy, and I care about you and all. But, in the past, I've usually been the girl that gets ditched or whatever, that's why I'm half expecting it this time.  SomethingAshley: At any rate... I guess I'll hopefully talk w/ you later. If not, I'm always here... :-)  I'M A DUMB BITCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
