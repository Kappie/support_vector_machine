And apparently its meant to be fun, but if thats some peoples idea of fun, then they can carry on and do it.  (Strange people)  I absolutly stand of Odur de Mour end Spout aswell, which is not very pleasant, and I was very hungry and thirsty.  But is was *cough* *cough* Yeah great fun???*cough* *cough*
