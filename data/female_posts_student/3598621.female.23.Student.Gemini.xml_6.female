(I should start my data collection in July so as to finish the pilot project before September!!)  - Respond to all emails and voice mail within a day by Friday, July 8.   Step 2: What are the obstacles  - Lack of motivation -- there is no immediate rewards or punishments related to these acts. The long-term benefits for cultivating these good habits have been acknowledged, reflected upon and written about. But the motivation is inconsistent, and the change of thought pattern has not fully taken place.   - History -- all of the habits discussed above are related to a tendency to procrastinate. The actions and thoughts tied to procrastination has been with me for two decades now. I desperately want to change these patterns of behavior, but the habits may be deeply rooted in my subconsciousness. Strong determination and will are required to change them. I know I'm not very strong in those areas, either. But I have good patience. Hope that helps.   I don't want to go too much into obstacles such as history and personality because they're even harder to change than the bad habits. I want to focus on areas where I could find leverage points instead.  - Influence of the subconscious I have been indulging my subconscious "interests" control my behavior, as if being interests-driven is OK. After all, there aren't any direct consequences. However, I've seen how my talented friends ruin their career because of their *strong interests* in video games. Interests aren't always a good thing. If they are not constructive and not productive for anyone, I really shouldn't indulge them any more. The voice of my subconsious tend to be lounder than my voice of reason. Theories claim that thinking is mostly done in the subconsious, and conscious reasoning often simply justify the decisions made at a deeper level. This is very creepy but I suspect that there is some truth to it. If that is the case, only stong values and deep beliefs could help me combat the thought patterns that I want to change.  - Slow temper, or avoidance of facing challenges asap. It seems like nothing could get me anxious except for pressure, stress or excitement. Unlike Wei, who claims to have a quick temper and wants to get everything done asap, I want to have "boring" things done alap (as late as possible). When I was young, finishing things early means my parents will assign me more work to do. Whereas doing a thorough job very slowly will get me some time to relax. It's not surprising, then, that I develop a habit of procrastination.   Today, putting things off could still make many tasks go away, but it has also taken its toll on my career and social life. It prevents me from putting my talents to use and being a reliable person. I'm not sure whether I'm getting into a career that awards slow temper and thorough time-consuming jobs. A consultant need to be quick, responsive, proactive, and fast in adapting to change, whereas I have a thought pattern that could indulge inertia.   I don't want to be seen as someone who is in the quarant of not responsive and not assertive if I want to pursue a consulting career. However, from my past experience of working on consulting projects, I don't think I honestly enjoy the act of consulting itself all that much anyways. Maybe that's why it hasn't helped me combat my slow temper. I don't know whether anybody would find consulting as fun as drawing though. I don't want to compare doing a phd dissertation with drawing or playing computer games, it's not really going to help this situation. As long as I know that my tendency to have too much patience, and my systematic avoidance of facing challenges early are major obtacles in the say, that's good.  - It's simply more fun, more comfortable, and easier to not do these things. It's not a crime that I'm not born to be a hard-working nerd. These things I listed above take efforts. Granted, doing these things will be much easier once I form a habit. Meanwhile, I don't have to blame my genes and my history for enjoying my favorite TV shows and great novels more than wriing my dissertation. It's understandable. However, I also know that I can't allow myself to only do fun things. It's not like doing research is not fun, I actually get a wonderful sense of fulfillment from it as well. It's harder, yes, and less comfortable, true. But I'm not trying to push myself to work 70 hours a week. I just want to make sure that I could do some basic things that my competitors in the job market oculd do. That I have the basic good habits necessary for one to be a reliable team player and a good leader. If others could do it, why can't I?
