Tonight I am going to that teen night thing and we are having free pizza and cotton candy not like I really need that or anything.  I think I am really starting to get annoying counting calories and everything and I would like to think I am not obsessed but I am begginning to think I might be.  It has gotten as bad as skipping meals and things like that and everytime I eat I feel a huge sense of guilt afterwards.  Maybe this is just normal for teenagers though and everyone is probably just over-reacting.    Anyways I am still excited for chemisty cause well I think I want to either major in Chem or Bio but I am not sure which one I like better or which one I will advance at more quickly.  I am really thinking I want to become a high school teacher.  Like I am not the most talented at science or anything and even though sometimes it seems really hard but it just really interests me.  When I see people doing their thing and teaching kids about my age I think how cool it would be to do that same thing.  I really look up to alot of older people that have chosen the teaching profession - I mean if you really get to know them they are not as different from teenagers than everyone thinks - they are caring, compassionate, and really have an understanding of what others are going through.  I'm sure it is not the easiest job with the best pay but I remember a quote I once read that went something like  "Chose a job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life." The quote really speaks to me strongly because I mean I would rather be enjoying life than rich and unhappy.  Still I continue to wonder about the future - Like will I ever meet someone that loves me back and will I ever get married and have kids.  Just the normal things that people are expected of today.  Considering I haven't been with many guys really it concerns me but most people say high school relationships don't usually work out.  It is really quite confusing, in fact almost everything in life has never really made sense.  Like this summer I really had the worst drivers ed. experience ever, met a boy and fell in love but that turned out awful, and couldn't even find a job.  But really now that I think about it I am not ready to drive yet and I should take more time to improve, I know now what kind of guy I *DON'T* want and exactly how I *DON'T* want to be treated, and now that I have seen my school schedule I was thinking "Thank Goodness I don't have a job because I know that would not be about to handle everything."  So I guess everything really happens for a reason and I feel that all the great and wonderful people I meet and have met in my life are there for a reason!
