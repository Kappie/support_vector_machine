Huh.  I think I may go to the mall.  I haven't been there since April 2nd.  The day I took my boards.  Did you know that it is July?    I had a patient start yelling at me this afternoon for hiding her "bill" today.  (I think she was saying bill...I'm still not positive about that)  I was informed that if her bill showed up on television, that it would become  my  bill.  Also that I should stop pretending that I didn't know what damn bill she was talking about.    She knew that it was July.  Which I didn't.  Even though I fully understand that the reason I saw fireworks lighting up the night sky recently was in celebration of the union's 228th birthday and not because I was kissing my new-found soulmate.  Because I was not kissing anyone, soulmate or otherwise.  Question of the day: Isn't the concept of "soul-mate" somewhat boring?
