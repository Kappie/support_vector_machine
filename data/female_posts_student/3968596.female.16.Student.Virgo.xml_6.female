She still made me cringe though---what with her tendency to be anal about  everything ---but it was okay.No death glares for me today!I also saw Jackie, ajournalism buddy (who btw also agrees that my teacher is anal, it appears she's seen it first-hand as an observer while waiting for guitar lessons), at Sounds of Music.   It's a freaky coincidence that I've also her seen a couple weeks ago at the mall. It's weird how I keep bumping into people from school. I'm not really used to it.It doesn't seemlike a big deal to most but I'm what you'd call...a social hermit during the summer timeor any vacation time. Why?Well, I can't drive myself---yet, andI like my solitude.      Think of it this way: I'm not anti-social,
