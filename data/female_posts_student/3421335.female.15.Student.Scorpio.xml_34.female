Your back it had shonea little the adult  The distance two  Just a little it had made far   When we would like to be together You thought for the first time  When you insert together, also this winter directly  When this time meeting, we would like to become gentler   Connecting the hand on this road of December,  We would like to walk Don't you think?  The north wind goodbye is Y form road here which is blown  Because the chest becomes painful, it probably will start walking first  Even promise how word it cannot put out to the mouth  Long separation it is to place, is not  After the releasing section to act playfully  Don't you think?  Name favorite of the child you heard  Now you cannot hear at all   When we would like to be together  You thought for the first time  When you insert together Cold wintery wind seems also the sky. . .  When this time meeting, we would like to become gentler  Being in Christmas side  The thinking drill you hold and would like to close  When we would like to be together, you thought for the first time  When you insert together, the night when the snow falls  Directly together... Together...
