Tonight is Joel's party. I wonder how big it's goign to get. Me and Sarah Milne are going together. I'm picking her up at the Keg after work. Brad'll probably be there, I wonder if we'll talk at all, or if I'll confront him or whatever. It'll be interesting to see how the evening pans out.  Today me, Danielle, Melissa and Leigh were all talking on msn. I wonder what the hell is going on with Danielle. I swear she's like depressed or something. I have just about had it with her though, I don't really care anymore what her problem is.  omg I miss Norm. It hasn't even been 24 hours since I've seen him.  I wonder when I'll see him when school comes. It'll be wierd because I'm not usually supposed to go out on school nights, but when else will I see him? Other than weekends I guess, I don't really want to think about it. Ah, I wish it was this time last week. I was so happy, I had 9 days parent-free, with Norm. I'll miss him a lot.  Okay enough sap, I've got to get ready for work anyway. Later
