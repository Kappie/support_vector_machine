We got out the paddling pool and filled it with cold water. It was sooo hot today. Too hot for my likeing. Then I had dinner with them. That was nice.  I've been playing on the gamecube alot. Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg. I know, sounds stupid. And it is, but its fun, so who cares.  Ross made a coat for one of his friends dad today. He makes stuff so quickly >.  Dad is standing right behind me (grrr) so I'll go now.          Loooove Zen xxx
