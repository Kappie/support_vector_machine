I'll be the first one to admit that i was not the nicest of all the girls in high school. some would even say i was a huge bitch. and i know that is not too far from the truth. i don't think that high school is a useful tool for judging one's character. with all the hormones and confusion, i completely understand now what i was feeling then. not to say that i can relate to any of the kids that are in high school, because i honestly think that in five years a lot can change. but thats an entirely separate entry. although i wasn't the nicest person back then, i think that i have changed a lot over the past five years. not to say that it has been all that easy...i mean every once in a while that sixteen year old girl comes out and starts throwing temper tantrums about how she has to be able to return the pair of shoes. but i never apologized to people that i may have hurt. and thinking about it now, i still wont apologize for my actions. not to say that they were justified. but i think that instead of apologizing and saying the words that people have come to take for granted, i put my apologies into actions. and i became a nicer person. my patience is another step that i have to work on. i think that because i have become a nicer person, i feel more of a need for this reassurance from others. and i have to say that i hate that about myself now. i mean, i kind of feel like i have regressed. i feel like i was once this strong-take-no-shit-from-anyone(and I MEAN ANYONE) girl into this young woman who is searching for acceptance into the places that she once thumbed her nose at. aim not talking about trendy bars or up-tight restaurants, but i mean the people that surround me in my life. and even the ones who just pass in and out. i think that right now is one of those times where my words have to go into the great unknown so that i can feel the reassurance that i am so searching for right now. i need to know that at the end of the day that everything will be okay. sometimes i just wish that i was stupid so that i never had the capability to analyze things a billion times over.
