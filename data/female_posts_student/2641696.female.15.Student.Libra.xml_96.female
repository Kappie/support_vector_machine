Okay, well, the performance was pretty fun, even if aimlessly wandering around downtown wasn't. The senior choir's first song was by far the highlight of the show, at least for me -- so beautifully spiritual and holy-sounding! I love that sort of thing. Inspirational; good thinking music.    Despite everyone's utmost attempts, I did not go speak to the bass guy. Even if he was cute and tall. This was mostly because there was another, cuter and more-liked person there ^^; But we did have a nice lookie relationship *g*   Another really cool thing is that B is an awesome person. Never really got the chance to talk to her, but me, M  B hung out a lot waiting for rehearsals and performances and stuff. And she's a great kid! It's always fun to find out someone's awesome. I love being impressed ^^; This happened more than once today, too... heeheheheehee..   Well. That's not all for now, but just to keep ya on yer toes, I won't be saying any more o_O (shhh!)
