Just before my mom left the house to go out, some guy called me, he said his name was peter... and supposedly hes a "SPECIAL" child...i really think its some sick joke my brother is playing on me....but ill find out sooner or l8er. okay, im gonna go now...i have more cereal boxes to smash..l8er ^o^
