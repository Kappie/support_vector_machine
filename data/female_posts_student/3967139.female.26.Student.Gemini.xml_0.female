Things are getting better with Nat.  Now that we are getting into more busy roads she doesn't want to drive anymore.  We were in four different states yesterday, that would take significantly longer back at home.  Things are just a lot closer back here.  We also passed into Eastern Standard Time yesterday.  It's been fairly easy to adjust to the time since we have spent a few days in each time zone.
