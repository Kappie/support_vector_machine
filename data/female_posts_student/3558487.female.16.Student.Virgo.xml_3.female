Lets see, Monday, i went to the zoo with James. That was a lot of fun! I really like white tigers, but they didn't have any on Monday and most of the animals were laying down cuz it was HOT, not because I was there like james told me. They did have tarantulas though, I could've done without those. Then we cooked my family dinner and it was surprisingly very good!   Tuesday: My sister and I spent the day w/ my dad. We went and got him a new suit at men's warehouse and then we ate lunch. After that, we went to SpeedZone which was fun. I don't really like running into people while driving GoKarts, but apparently other people liked running into me. After that, i saw 50 First Dates at the dollar theater and it was 50 cent tuesday! Well, everyone else knew this information as well and it was very crowded. We had to sit on the second row which wasn't too bad, but near the end my neck did start hurting a little. A lot of people laughed really loud, which isn't a big deal, but it was a very dramatic laugh/scream which was kinda funny. That was a good movie, kinda weird sometimes, but good and cute. So the next movie i wanna see is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.   I've been sooo tired lately and i was guna sleep in tomorrow but we have flute sectionals, so that isn't guna work out. Maybe Friday i will sleep in.   So i've had to drive my sister and dad lately cuz his car is in the shop and today as i'm driving on the highway my dad tells me that my driving seriously scares him. Can't say that isn't the first time i've heard that. But, I've never gotten a speeding ticket or in a wreck. Oh well, people just need to trust my skill.. :)  That's it for today!
