Well, okay, I know that's naive, but still.    I just came back from the dentist... AGAIN ...I finally got that cleaning I wanted.  My teeth look all nice and sparkly, but I may have "a cavity or two" in the back.  He didnt really check, because I have to go back next week and have him look at my guard to help with my incessant teeth grinding... so I guess I may have a filling "or two" to look forward to as well.  (sigh)  It seems that I should have looked into this teeth grinding problem earlier because it has caused bone loss, a mild infection in my gums because now I have gaps where the plaque can build up, and other shit...and so on and so on and so on.  It's like never-ending!  And its not like I havent been to the dentist in  forever , its just been 2 years, so what gives, man???  Can all this happen in the span of 2 years?  And if so, who or what is to blame?  Because really, I've never been happier in my life!  Then I think, all of this is so minor compared to dealing with Chemotherapy or something, which a friend of mine is going through right now and is taking it VERY well.  Still has a sense of humor and everything.  So really, who am I to complain.  At least its not root canal, though I can totally see the dentist saying I need  that  next too!!  argh.
