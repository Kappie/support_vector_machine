Here is how you matched up against all the levels:     Level    Score       urlLink Purgatory   (Repenting Believers)   Very High       urlLink Level 1 - Limbo   (Virtuous Non-Believers)   Low       urlLink Level 2   (Lustful)   Very Low       urlLink Level 3   (Gluttonous)   High       urlLink Level 4   (Prodigal and Avaricious)   Moderate       urlLink Level 5   (Wrathful and Gloomy)   High       urlLink Level 6 - The City of Dis   (Heretics)   Very Low       urlLink Level 7   (Violent)   Low       urlLink Level 8- the Malebolge   (Fraudulent, Malicious, Panderers)   High       urlLink Level 9 - Cocytus   (Treacherous)   Very Low      Take the  urlLink Dante Inferno Hell Test    I guess if you have to fit in somewhere in the world of this quiz,  urlLink Purgatory is as good as it gets , at least according to the quizmakers:   You have escaped damnation and made it to Purgatory, a place where the dew of repentance washes off the stain of sin and girds the spirit with humility. Through contrition, confession, and satisfaction by works of righteousness, you must make your way up the mountain. As the sins are cleansed from your soul, you will be illuminated by the Sun of Divine Grace, and you will join other souls, smiling and happy, upon the summit of this mountain. Before long you will know the joys of Paradise as you ascend to the ethereal realm of Heaven.   Not suffering damnation is generally a good thing.  However, I am slightly disturbed by my high score for Level 8.  It  urlLink doesn't sound like a very fun place .  I'll have to do my best to avoid it.
