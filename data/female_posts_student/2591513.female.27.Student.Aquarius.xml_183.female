But no, they are saying that I am going to need 3 semesters.  So I may have to take Spanish.    I guess in all reality that Spanish is actually going to help me especially since I live here in CA.  Not to be stereotypical, but souther California has a large population of hispanics.  So I think that it would be good for me to relearn Spanish.  I guess for the most part I am venting because I am scared that I will fail miserably this semester.  I am taking so many units.  But the reality is that in order for Ed and I to get out from under this debt hole and stop getting parental support...I am going to have to have a career of my own.  The Navy just doens't pay nearly as much as they should.  Ed was telling me stories of some of the guys he is working with.  I must say that for the first time in a long time I am afraid.  He is going into Iraq, a fairly unstable part of it.  The guys he is currently serving with have seen so many unbelievable things.  There is so much going on there.  I worry about his well being.  I worry about our son's well being.  I am scared shitless and well I haven't been able to really talk about it.  See if I cry then I know Ed will feel bad.  I don't want him to have to worry any more than he already does.  Last year he stayed in Kuwait, so even though I was afraid, I knew he would be relatively safe.  Now he is actually going to be in Iraq and I am TERRIFIED.  I just know how unstable things are there.  Then at home I just have to pretend all is well and try and not focus on my fears.  Then night comes and I can't sleep and my mind wanders and I take the time to cry alone.  I am painfully worried.  I feel alone at times, no friends nearby.  The few friends I do have I keep at arms length for fear that I may destroy whatever friendship we have...without knowing it, like with my other friends.  I feel alone in that sense.  I need to get out more.  Maybe I will meet some good people while taking these classes...one can only hope that there will be some mature adults I can make friends with.  Today is one of those "Calgon take me away!" days.
