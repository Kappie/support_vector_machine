The language divide between her and her mother made me consider writing about my own, not really the same in particularities, language divide between me and my mother/family. Believe it or not, everything below this little preface was going to be a just a comment--and it ended up being almost, quite literally, as long as the original thing. Far too embarrassed to post all this writing to another's blog, I chopped up my thoughts to a nice bite-sized morsel, and decided to bring the entirety here (with a few touch-ups). It would be longer had it not come to life in some other place. Still, I hope the fullness of the idea comes across.  My younger sister, who lives with my father, which means she can come and go or not come home at all for several nights in a row, has been taking advantage of my father not paying attention to her entrance and exit habits. And the family is talking about it. Seriously talking about it.  Skip ahead...  My grandmother, who also lives with my dad in his fantastic, new home and thinks young ladies of 22 years should be home in their own beds every night of the week, especially if they live under a roof she shares, is not quite as unbothered by the habits of the little street prowler (my horribly irresponsible sister) as my father. So, though it is not actually her home (in that she doesn't own it), she has been proclaiming to the whole family...miles and miles of telephone conversations in the last two weeks...that she is going to put my little sister out. :)  Last week, as I was making dinner for my grandma, we were talking about my sister--yet again. I said, trying my best to take grandma's side and say it in a way that renews my membership in the family, "One of these nights she's gonna find what she's looking for in these streets." Grandma loved it. I got that drawn out "Mmmmmmmm-hmmmm" characteristic of southern-southern locution. I felt fantastic, because sometimes it's very hard for me to participate in family drama without EVERYONE feeling as though I'm patronizing them or being condescending...(sigh)...but ever so often I find that I have negotiated the line between school-Tony and home-Nysha brilliantly. I feel like I'm a part of my family--that they can still love me even though they are incredibly suspicious of my motives concerning everything--just because I am bookish and an English major.   Anyway, I was too happy about my membership in the family being validated too soon.  I was standing in the room with my grandma and a cousin, talking to my mother on my cell, and she, too, was talking to everyone I was in the room with through me. (Does that make sense?) I suggested that maybe my sister could go live with my cousin when grandma finally puts her out. My mom said, "How? She's livin' on a humbug her damned self!"* I was floored. I had never heard that phrase before in my life...and in my family beautiful little "nothings"...that mean the world to me...like that surprise me everyday. But I know better than to make a big deal out of it--everyone thinks I'm being sarcastic if I seem to love it too much. But I genuinely and earnestly do. It's one of the reasons I'm so combative against people who lord standard speech above all other varieties. No one is going to tell me that there is not poetry in that--that there is not beauty unable to be found anywhere else in life in what my mother said. I could spend my entire life cataloguing my family's natural locution for the whole world to be able to read and adore, yet still I wouldn't be able to record enough of it.   Back to the story...but before I could catch myself, I'd said, "Ma, where did you get that? I love that." She "sucked her teeth" as loud as teeth-sucking gets and said, "Toe...nysha...puh-lease." She was so disappointed she couldn't even respond. My mother, more than anyone else, feels distressed about the divide she imagines (my God, I hope it is imaginary) there is between me and...my people. To her, though she is herself college-educated, the more I learn and the more I read--please readers don't you dare judge her for this, because I understand what she means--I am also becoming corrupted in other ways. She is savvy--she knows that there are idiots out there who think the more books they read, the more papers they write, the better they are than other human beings; they think the more fully living life and knowledgeable about the world they are. Whole other story...anyway. She doesn't want me to become like that, and no matter how fervently I try to reassure her, she is still uncertain. And I imagine her, night after night, tacking onto her prayers, "...and Lord, please don't let my child forget who she is. Help her stay connected to us. Amen." Seriously.  So before I ever tried to renew my membership in the family by, yet again, trying to show them that the living language that is in them is still in me, too...I should've known that my victory would be short-lived. And I was right back where I was before I ever even spoke--as far as my mother was concerned. On the outside, longing to be let in. Begging for them to see that I belong. Interestingly, I often feel the same longing toward the academic world--the other side she thinks I have pledged my allegiance to. She's wrong.   When the truth is even more complex than I could ever even tell my mother about. And I never know which way to turn, loving both worlds as ardently as I do.     *Translation/Explanation: My cousin, not having her own place, can't have my sister come stay with her when she herself is benefiting from someone else's (perhaps begrudging) kindness and/or charity.
