They never win because sororities are based on "high priced," fancy family based orginizations. The sister's in the different groups go as far as setting up parties to get the "Little Sisters" hooked on Ketamine, or "Special K," and take them to a male fraternity house where they have already prearranged to "deflower" the sisters. That is preposterous!!!! I definatly am thinking twice about being in a sororitiy group for fear of becoming somone I am not, and subjecting myself to their immature, childish, self-absorbing ways! I think I will stick to clubs where everything is in PUBLIC so I can assure my safety...lol.
