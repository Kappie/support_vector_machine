Didn't get to make up the calculus quiz I needed to make up like I intended to do, and I'm not sure that I'll be able to get around to it very soon now. Things are coming to a semi-close, and I'm never practically ready (although spiritually, I always am).  'Nuff said about that.    On a different note, what is insanity? I can't really plug in a definition, what with the numerous relations that exist.  Sometimes I think I may have lost my sanity half my life ago. I was 8 years old, and something really weird happened-- I don't know what it was-- I didn't then, and I still don't know. One day, I just started crying and couldn't stop. There was a reason, but I couldn't explain it- not even to myself. And up to this day, I have no clue what happened. I was terrified and insecure and saddened and anguished and ashamed about it. The day I burst out into tears in church with a group of concerned people futilely attempting to consolate me was the day my mother said it had to stop. I didn't mean to cry; and yet I couldn't stop.   This continued for an extended period of time, and I was on the verge of seeing a psychologist when it stopped. Again, I don't know how nor why it stopped. It just did.   Maybe my subconscious regret for causing so much trouble made it stop. That's my best theory up until now, although I have none to explain its commencement.    And then everything was different. I don't know how nor why, but it was.    I don't know whether anyone shares such a strange episode with me, but I think that's when the general concept of rational thought process I had left me.  It amazes me how much fear people have of their own minds. I'm faulty of it, too, sometimes, until I return to my original stand that the mind is a gift and must be accepted as is, no matter how wacky it may seem. I actually like to appreciate that wackiness in other people, for they're those who aren't afraid of thinking. In essence, it's really not so scary, and it's okay to diverge from the flow.   At one point in my life-- namely, roughly two years ago- there was light, and although things were still never the same, they were better this time. I've drifted so far away from it, and I'm waiting on something to fall out of the sky for me. Literally. And I actually think that it'll happen.    So, if you think I'm a little out of it, don't penalize me for it. I don't mean badly, and it's not so bad. Really.    "With Every Light" by Smashing Pumpkins   Taking over  We're taking over  Throw the weight up off you shoulders now  That we can show our love  It's almost over it's almost over  No more war and no more soldiers  To stand against His love  Away with all the troubles that you've made  Away with waiting for another day  Away  Look ma the sun is shining on me  Impatient, in love and aching to be  Could you believe in heaven  If heaven was all you had  We're taking over we're taking over  Throw away your four leafed clovers  And stand beside this love  Away with everything you've grown to hate  Away with anything that holds you safe  Away  And every light I've found  Is every light that's shining down on me  I'm never alone  Look ma the sun is shining on me  Taking my time to do as I please  Could you believe in heaven  If heaven was all you had  The sun is beaming, radiating  All the love we are creating  We are creating  And every light I've found  Is every light that's shining down on me  I'm never alone
