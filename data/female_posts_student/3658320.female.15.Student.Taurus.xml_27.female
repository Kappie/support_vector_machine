We went putt putt and went swimming! It is fun going swimming with them..but aj kept trying to dunk me which was very mean of him!!!! lol... and then we went home after swimming for a while and he ate dinner at our house before my softball game that nite!! SO yea...i was walkn outside to put a towel on a chair and there are steps going out onto the patio and i totally miss the 2nd step and fall right on my ankle really really really bad!! and i started screaming really loud!! Aj was the only one who saw me fall and everything and he came running out and so did my mom..and it hurt liek a mother! so bad!! and then after me screaming and in pain for a lil bit i finally got up from off the ground and my mom helped me back into the house..and aj was playing docter with me and helped me get ice and a towel and put ice on my ankle and made me feel a lot better!! thank you aj!! i really liked that!! and then i still wanted to go to softball that nite with my ankle in pain but o well..so i went and played on it..even though it hurt really bad!! ow! and then we went to dairy queen afterwards and it was good and drove aj home! i went home and looked at my ankle and it was huge! it was swollen alot!! and it still hurt bad so i had to elevate it and ice it some more..then my mom asked if i wanted to go to the er and stuff even though it was like already 10 at nite! i wanted to but didnt want to make her go out to it! so i said no and we went in the morning! and i found out that its just a sprain and so i have to wear this air cast thingy! and i found out a good thing!! I had to take x-rays and the doctor said my growth plates r just starting to close so he said that i might still grow a couple more inches! omg i was soo soo happy! i'm 2 short and need to grow!! haha but yea..then i went to aj's baseball game that nite too...and went to marching band with him after that..i'm such a supportive g/f...he owes me for that!!
