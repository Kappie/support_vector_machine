I hope he's not just saying that. This could be a big step for us. He assured me he really wants things to work with us. *happy sigh* Last night Julie called me. I haven't talked to her in a year and a half. We chatted for hours, til 2 a.m. Today she brought the kids over. I couldn't be any happier! The bad part? I caught my brother in LIES. She finally proved me wrong, and I really don't know what to say about it. *shakes her head in shame* He's so pathedic....
