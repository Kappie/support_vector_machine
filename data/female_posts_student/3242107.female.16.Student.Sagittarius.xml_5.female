" lol it was so funny. and then chuck told us that it was trace that called lol.---> trace is a senior from our spanish class, that gets on mr.wilson's nerves, along with morgan, chuck, stefani, christa, and travis. it will be really weird finishing school without all of my senior friends :( i was walking with anna to 7th period and i told her how much emptier the halls were , and that i'd rather the freshmen leave and the seniors stay. jeez, we have way too many freshmen.....1006! craziness. o well, im going to graduation next week , o and i so scored! i got out of taking 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th period exams..! that means i get out 2 days early.
