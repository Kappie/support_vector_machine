You once told me you don't look at the sky but how can I believe that. You're such a dreamer and sometimes when I glance at you you'll have this faraway look in your eyes and I can't help but smile. I'm not doing much here, just trying to get over some illnesses. I was up all night last night sitting in the bathroom because it felt like my stomach was going to crawl up my throat at any moment. When I did finally get to sleep, It was damn near 3 AM. Woke up around noon and my stomach was still doing little flip flops so I'm just sitting here taking it easy. Derick's graduation party is today and as bad as I feel about it, I'm not going to go. It would be just my luck to get there and then embarrass myself by throwing up all over people. Oh god, how mortifying! Besides, I really wasn't prepared to go in the first place and seeing how you're not going either I don't feel as bad as I could. And being around Derick is kind of uncomfortable since Emily broke up with him. I didn't think Emily gave him enough of a chance, sure, but she's still my best friend, more like my sister at times, and it's kind of weird when he just starts talking about her bitterly. I'm sorry for what she did to him but I consider both of them good friends..and well...getting stuck between them is definitely something that grates on my nerves. I'm always the mediator it seems..I guess it's just because of my understanding nature. LOL..Funny, right? You sounded kind of sick on the last days of school, maybe I got this damn cold from you. The moment summer vacation hits I get a cold. What are the odds? Oh well, It hasn't been that bad. All I know is report cards come out Monday/Tuesday and I'm dreading to see what I got on my final exams. I know, it's my own fault I didn't study, but honestly, the days just drag on and on and AHH! lol Sometimes you just have to scream. Just like sometimes you have to say what the fuck..Good quote, Thanks Booger! I'm a little more light hearted than usual, maybe it's because I'm sick, maybe it's because I know that went camping and are hopefully having a fun time with Jess and the others. I'm stuck here for awhile but it's okay because I'm starting to feel better and that's always a good thing.
