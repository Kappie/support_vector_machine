But since I haven't gotten the chance to update my untouched diary in too long, I guess this is pretty useful since I'm on this computer half of my life! People like coleen  mary have probably influenced my decision on creating this. I don't know. I just find it rather interesting that I can catch up with my Year 12 friends through their bloggings. Its like when I saw Mary at the YFC Anniversary..it felt like I was readily  updated enough. Despite the fact I haven't seen her in too long! But yeah since that was ages ago..  Right now I'm thinking (as always hehe). But people have got me thinking. Individuals can be so deep (not saying who)..so deep that they become emotionally retarded that they get lost in their own dwellings of emotions. Emotion itself is such a deep word. But yesterday I was speaking to someone, trying to counsel them (as always) but there. *pop* they got lost in their emotionally distressed world. So lost  confused that no matter how hard they tried, they fell deeper into that little back hole. I get that alot so Im pretty much used to it. But I cant help but feel for the person, you know? Hence why psychology would not be a very good course to take upon next year. I get too wrapped up in everyone else's dramas or whatever that I myself get emotionally involved. But why am I thinking so much. Anyway I do pray for that person I honestly do. Thay they may be happy  content with what they have, let go any regrets  forgive themselves.   Patricia and I, came up with this theory. She reckons she's got the pearly whites to lure everyone. Whilst I on the other hand believes its the heart..it is though. I'm more attracted to the heart (and I do have a hair fetish I must admit haha). But going to an all boy school..yes there are some up there with the good sort..hahaha you know what I'm talking about darling! But a good heart? mhmm..  Anyways I talked to Cheska today! I miss her. Hurry hurry Year 12! Finish already. Let alone all of the other assessments I have to get through - 7 to be in fact. And there's only three weeks of this term left! Remember that song by Peter Andre? Give me some kind of sign girl? hahahahehe just finishing with a random quote!  Happy birthday Reena! And Fran! haha *beautiful eyes*   -- feeling sick *cough* --
