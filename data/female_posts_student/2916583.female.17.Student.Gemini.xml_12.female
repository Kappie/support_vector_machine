She's grounded now, like me...except I'm not sure if I'm grounded or not, cause I watched Friends, The Simpsons, and got online.    Anyway, I'm just waiting for my grandfather to come and take me to my house.  I forgot my calculator, lip stuff, bookbag, money and a shirt to go under this one...it shows too much!  I wish I could just go to sleep instead of coming back though.  I went to sleep kind of early too.   TGIF!  I showed my mom my interim (we finally went out for making straight A's for semester...gotta love Cici's), and she was "disappointed" in me b/c I got two B's.  Actually, I'm glad they were B's and not C's like I thought they would be.  From now on, I suppose I'll actually have to pay attention in Chemistry and Math Analysis.  They drag on FOREVER!  At least I have lots of people to talk to in Chemistry...In Math Analysis, I'm surrounded by people I can't talk to. (except the hispanic ppl in my class...they're amazed that I am half Puerto Rican and have blonde hair and green eyes). Speaking of which, I had a dream that we decided to go to Puerto Rico in March and in July, and I hadn't packed.  Strange enough, I was in the journalism room, trying to find everything so I wouldn't miss the plane.  Even more strange is that I actually was finding stuff.  At least it wasn't about snakes. It's only 7:30?  Gosh, time is slow!  Hopefully, it won't speed up again when we get to my house, cause I don't want to miss 3rd period.   You know, I don't have a single scrapbook.  I was just thinking about that because I was looking up at all the pictures in the journalism room.  It might be nice to have one to *capture the memories* (note the sarcasm).   I'm not sure what I'm going to do this weekend.  It's going to be pretty hot for Virginia's March.  Today, it's supposed to exceed 80Â° (hence, the corset/tank top I'm wearing that shows a lil too much of my chest.  That reminds me; I need to put batteries in my calculator.  Don't ask how I got that from revealing tops.  Well, it's 7:40, so I better go outside and look out for my grandfather.  Later.    Wonder Woman (Diana, Princess of Themyscira). You're used to the royal treatment, and sometimes come off a little spoiled.  But you're also enthusiastic and an anchor of stability to your friends.    urlLink   Which Justice League character are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
