As I think I have found some calm in this storm it brews yet again...I see him and think of him with her...how I long to be in her place again...the wounds are still fresh and the hurt is too...  It's hard to know that you're truly a woman now...you don't feel as if you're ripped at the seams of childhood and adulthood anymore...you know that you're an adult...you feel the heaviness of it in your heart as you look back and long for the solace and innocence of your youth and beauty...who knew that at 17 you could feel so old and so weary? Has my idealism lead to my ultimate heartbreak? Will this confusion ever end?  This time I know i'm not being overdramatic...I'm fighting the bitterness and hurt of lost love and praying for the strength to have dignity through all of this...God is my only hope now.  But in my darkness I know I'll see the light again...I'll find my inner picture of beauty and love and peace...It waits for me and I will wait too.  I'll try not to search when it isn't time for the scavenger hunt to begin.  I will let it run to me in due time, and until then my arms will remain open waiting to receive my peace.
