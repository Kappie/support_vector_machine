The longer you live, the more you'll realize that adversity is the rule in life, not the exception. But don't look at problems as things to be avoided: These are the things that test your character, patience, and faith. Sure, we might suffer grief and pain, but with Christ we can endure any hardship.  Adapted from: The Bible Promise Book for Teens      Give glory to God even when you are in your deepest darkest times. -Abigail   When everything seems to be going against you, remember that an airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford
