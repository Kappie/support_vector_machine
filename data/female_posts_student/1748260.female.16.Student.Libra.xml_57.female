There's Lei Ping..Michelle...Charlene..Siew Ting.. ..Joslyn..bought the damn uniform at last but bein' the last group, I got the skirt size 38.. GUESS WHAT! It's too big for me.. Like damn? I gotta wait until next Wednesday when the new stock comes in... Then I can change..FREAK! Hai..then after that went to take some photo for the new ez-link card. Alright... yet another tiring day..  "Thoughts of you dance through my mind. Knowing, it is just a matter of time. Wondering... will u ever be mine? You are in my dreams, night... and sometimes... day. The thoughts seem to never fade away."
