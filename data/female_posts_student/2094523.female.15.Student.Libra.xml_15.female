Its that lame but thats how we work.  so what makes us the way we are? Greed i assume.  hmm ..man, we are all such greedy bitches we have a home, money, family, clothes, food.. but i guess that just aint enuf. im a bitch ure a bitch...which brings me bak to what i always say. humans are fucking stupid.
