The weirdness that is my mind, haha.  It's fun to write again .   BTW, Baptist Hospital is the most confusing place I've ever been to- and the vending machine ate three dollars.  Rawr .   Call from Morgan last night!  Crazy girl ..I'm going to jump on her as soon as she gets home. Bear hug her or something. It'll be fun.   I want to go see  Sleepover  in my pajamas. Anyone wish to join me? Or let's see  Spiderman 2 . Tobey Maguire... *  melts  * Someone please come out with me.
