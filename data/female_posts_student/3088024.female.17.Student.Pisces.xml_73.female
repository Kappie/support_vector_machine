Then Saturday night, Jenna says "torg and i are sleeping outside tonight" apparently she also had that idea out on her roof.  So I thought well if Jenna is doing it too, then it must be a good idea.  Wrong.  Note to self:  If Jenna ever says "I am doing...", don't do it.  Sleeping outside in April in dumb, and now I am sick.
