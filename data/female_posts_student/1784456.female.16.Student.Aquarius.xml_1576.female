(We went to see  urlLink  Ocean Colour Scene   It was ammmaaazing! Aaah, I love their music! We danced the whole time... ok, we didn't dance we just moshed! Yeay! The sideliner guys were 'Simple Kid' (?) They were reaaallly good, but they were on first and the whole crowd just wanted OCS so no one danced! There was a age gap of about 14-50 in the crowd! (But we got everyone dancing!) I loooved the atmosphere, everyone's so happy and jumping madly! I'll have to go see another gig, you should too! *brainwashes you into watching OCS* *adds some polish for good measure*
