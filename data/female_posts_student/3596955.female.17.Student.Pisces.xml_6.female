And it is at that notion, why I am in several ways, not ok. I am not okai for the fact that I am contemporaneously bearing staying up awake til 4am (5am last night, or should I say, morning), tolerating the treachery of the 5 or so it seems, immeasurable tasks anticipating to be accomplished. In actuality, I should be brooding, fretting, worrying, stressing, irritated, exasperated, livid  outraged. But I'm not. Im okai. Presumably, it seems as though I don't believe I am okai, as evident throughout the repeated phrase. But really I am. But should I not be okai for the fact that I am ok. And at that thought, it scares me.  The only concern I have at this moment is the fact that I have not seen nor heard from anyone in too long - and that my friends is a travesty. It is utterly enticing to drop, relax  do what any normal teenager would do - smoke. hahahaha only joking s'if I'd smoke ;) I'm asthmatic! As I was saying, it is not unusual for I to be home alone on weekends, even til 2am at times.   My family is constantly out with the CFC Community - yes! We got to love them. My brother surely does. He weeps at the thought of not attending a meeting at least once per week. Hence why I love my YFC Community. Hence why I miss everyone. It is a community where everyone brings out the best in everyone. It is where you can be yourself, be surrounded by people, meet people old  new. It is where you will eventually find best friends, if not - find friends you had lost contact in previous years. It is where positive vibes are definately  ultimately disseminated. It is where you learn, cherish, love  worship the Big man upstairs. It is where you are you. It is where I want to be. Juss missin everyone! that's all ;D  At least Ian's is on the weekend! If you are not there, you are not anywhere. hahaha.  -- missin you --
