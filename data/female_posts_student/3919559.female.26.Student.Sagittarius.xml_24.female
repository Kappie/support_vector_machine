Yep. Deal with it.  Maintaining a traditional website was just too cumbersome and inconvenient for me, given the tools available to me and my limited and dated knowledge of HTML, and that's why you saw so few updates to my previous site. So hopefully, with Blogger's much more convenient features, there will be more fresh content for both of you (and hopefully more soon) to read.  From this point forward, please consider me official converted to blogging!  Brenda
