What does it mean to give more than a 100%? Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more than 100%? We have all been to those meetings where someone wants you to give more than 100%. How about achieving 103%?  Well, here's a little mathematical formula that might help you answer these questions:  If the letters of the alphabet  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z were numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 then:  H - A - R - D - - W - O - R - K would be: 8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98%  and,  K - N - O - W - L - E - D - G - E 11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7 +5 = 96%  but,  A - T - T - I - T - U - D - E 1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100%  however - -  B - U - L - L - S - H - I - T 2+21+12+12+19+8+9+20 = 103%  and, look how far ass kissing will take you:  A - S - S - - K - I - S - S - I - N - G 1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9 +14+7 = 118%  So, one can then conclude with mathematical certainty that: While, hard work and knowledge will get you close, and, attitude will get you there, it's Bullshit  Ass Kissing that will put you over the top.
