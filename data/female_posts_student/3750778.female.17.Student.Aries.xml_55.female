I'm also going to see if I can  reserve  a parking spot/locker (i'll  GIVE THEM THE MONEY THEY SO CRAVE  via Alesha)  I feel that they could at least extend me that curtousy seeing my parking spot was un-avalible to me half of last year becuase of someone parking in it. :P  Also, my locker didn't have 'hooks' in it, dammit.
