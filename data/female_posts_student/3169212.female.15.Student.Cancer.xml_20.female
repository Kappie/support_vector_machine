The demon in black jumped down, the white in his spiked hair standing out, he drew his word and prepared to attack. She stopped as his sword was nearing her head, one of her katanas hovered over her eyes as she turned to face her assailant. But all she saw was a black blur, she held her sword ready as she walked on slowly. Hiei was crouching on a tree branch watching this girl curiously. Her walk was slow and paced, she came to the path where Baka stood with Kurama. Hiei made his attack as she turned to look at the path she had just walked on. her sword just blocked his but her still knocked her down. She dragged on the harsh path for a moment before standing, her long black finger nails that looked like they had been sharpened into points, wrapped around the hilt of her sword as she poised for the next attack. Baka and Kurama watched as the two headed off on another attack.   The Girl held her ground as Hiei again became a blur, she looked around the leaned back her sword shielding her heart, Hiei knocked the word from her hand, she performed a quick back flip and stood, She froze hearing the voice of Kurama, her other katana half out of it's sheath.  "Stop NOW!" he said sternly as she looked out of the corner of her eye at him  "Oh! COME on!!!" her sword slid back into the sheath, "You're like the annoying older brother I never wanted but got ANYWAY!"  Kurama walked up to her hitting her in the head, "None of that anger now...Sak...saki, How do you pronounce your name?"  "The human and demonic tongues could never properly pronounce my name for the fact that it takes at least 20 years, starting from birth, to even grasp the simple pronunciation of the language of my home...Call me Hitogoroshi, Or Hito actually" she smiled picking up and sheathing her sword  "Doesn't that mean Murderer?" Baka asked curiously  "yup..." Hito said smiling
