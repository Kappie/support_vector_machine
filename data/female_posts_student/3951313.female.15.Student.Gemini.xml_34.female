I feel these things  I want out  I want normal  I don't want to be with my dad  I want to be with my friends  They love me, they actually care  I want to be free  Just hold me please   Kiss my fears away  Hold my shaking form  Tell me everything will be okay  That we'll get through it all together  That you love me  and will no matter what   Emotions running all over the place  Love hiding fear  Questions hiding scars  Going numb  Help me  Love me  Save me
