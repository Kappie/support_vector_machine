"No more!" it is saying to me. "We don't want to experience anymore tough times. Let's just relax with a pint of icecream and  Whose Line Is It Anyway?  and let those tough times wash over us like so much caramel in Ben  Jerry's  Karmel Sutra ."     Well, Body, if only things were that simple.     I am making a promise though, to myself, to bring back some youthfulness to that beating heart inside me. See, although my internal self is popping and cracking and aching and inflamed, my external self looks like she's about eighteen years old. She gets carded for lottery tickets even though she will be twenty-four in just a few months. But the irony is that if you look really close, just beyond the smooth skin speckled with freckles from summer, the round, rosy cheeks, the sunburned, cherub mouth and the few dot-to-dot blemishes of a high school girl, you will see wrinkles and dark circles around the eyes. If one feels old in spirit, no matter how youthful in appearance, that "old" will find a way out. It will manifest itself around the eyes, in the joints, in the muscles, and eat you alive like a cancer.     What I need more than anything is some R For some reason my busy-body self has decided this means  painting the living room . No, the act of painting is not relaxing and will probably leave my back a mess of jumpled knots (as if it isn't already), but I'm thinking long term here. Painting the living room a nice color will make it more inviting, thus allowing me to relax in it. This project begins on Friday.    The other thing I'm considering is a hot salt scrub massage thingy. (I don't know the exact name but you get the idea.) That sounds like  Heaven , especially if it's performed by a Ryan Gosling look-alike with his shirt off. (Just watch, I'll get that--but he'll be gay). And some new shoes to cradle my feet in soft, loving ecstacy while I stand on them for eight hours at a time.     Baby steps, People. Baby steps. I'll get twenty-three again, you wait and see.     ---    Now that I know my dear friend--my favorite OTB buddy, my favorite person to see  The Notebook  with--is reading, I have to give a shout out. Wassup chick! Stop "snuckering!" (
