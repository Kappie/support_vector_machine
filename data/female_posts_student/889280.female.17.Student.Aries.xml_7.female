The doctor told me the procedure would take about 45 minutes, and I would be unconscious the whole time so he could drill and stitch in peace. Essentially what happened was that my four wisdom teeth needed to be pulled out because my mouth was "too small" to fit them... and they were still under my gum and so I needed surgery to get them out before they caused more trouble.  The nurse attached those clasps-like things to both of my arms to keep track of my hearbeat in those heartbeat line monitors where a ~~~~ is goood, and a ----- practically means you're dead. I also had those tight heart pressure thingies attached to my left arm. My right arm was reserved for the UV pipe that stuck into the veins of my arm, and I could actually feel something fluid-like going into my arm. It wasn't painful or anything, but it was discomforting.  The next thing I knew, I woke up. The sneaky doctor had injected the medication without saying a word, so I had already been unconscious for 50 or so minutes, and I finally woke up. I was unstable on my feet at first, but it got better. There was also intense bleeding for about 2 hours, and now it's gone.. which is considered pretty good, I guess, because the bleeding is supposed to go on for 2 days, then wane out.  The only bad thing is that I'll probably be limited to soggy and soft food. Sigh, goodbye fast-food places.
