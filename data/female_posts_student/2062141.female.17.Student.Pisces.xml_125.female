Grades, friends, family... I'm just hoping it all goes up. It's nothing really specific I suppose... just little things, like people not making time for me lately, uncertainty about my future, sad that my b-day party doesn't look like it's ever gonna work not crucial I know, but it's important to me, I want everyone to have a good time and be able to go and stuff... and then just the whole thing with Justin and Peter dying... it's just really sad and it reminds us of our own mortality i think. Least I have yet another reason why I don't ever plan to ski again in my life... or uh get cancer.  Well anyway.. it's my birthday next Tuesday, 17... I'll have to go see a rated R movie. But even better than that is that I get my full license on Sunday! I told my mom it's Saturday though cause she's making me go to Mallorie's music scholarship audition on Sunday, no driving for me then. Not that I'll have anyone to drive around with on Saturday... cause everyone made plans that didn't include me... Oh well no biggie.. i can drive around by myself i guess
