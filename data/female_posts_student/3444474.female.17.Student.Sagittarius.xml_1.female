I'm intrigued by this girl singing it though...JoJo...she's beautiful, and her voice is so amazing...I don't know why I like her so much, lol. I'm not usually into this kind of music but I can't help listening to it over and over again. It's the same thing with that Maria Mena song, "You're The Only One". I can't stop listening to it, once I start, I don't wanna turn it off, I just want to sing to it over and over.  God...what the fuck is wrong with me?  I can't sleep, Lord knows why. My sleep schedule is totally fucked officially. I wish it wasn't. I start work on monday, I'd kinda like to not be tired when I go in.   //sings, "Get out, right now, it's the end of you and me..."  GOD MAKE IT STOP!!!!!!  I don't even feel that way about anyone, so what the fuck?!  Oh well...whatever.   At any rate, I am bored at 3:30AM...someone hit me with something...hard.
