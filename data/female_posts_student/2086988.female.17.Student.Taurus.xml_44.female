Let's see, I missed turning in my theatre project and an Algebra test. Oh well, no worries. At least we had a sub in chem I heard, and I was only counted absent for 2 class periods, lol that looks real good. I feel better though, so I'll probably go to school tomorrow.   I'm just so sick of school and everything. You would think that being back in school would take my mind off things and be able to concentrate better, but no, it's actually harder. I want to be 18, I want to just be out on my own, away from my parents, and I know that as each day passes, it gets closer to that one day. It's just time doesn't seem to be going fast enough...No one really understands, Ritika ridicules me, calls me stupid blah blah, Kiera just sympathizes she really can't relate, Embry helps some, but she has her own problems right now, Rhonda doesn't understand at all, Dylan is like Kiera, etc.   Anyways I've always had an issue expressing my emotions/feelings to the people I love, I don't know why. I can't open up the true way I feel, which is why I always seem hyper and try to be funny. I don't let people know if I'm upset or mad, like on Sat night, I could of easily said something, but I didn't. Also, I can talk to Kiera all day about how much I love David and stuff, but when I get on the phone with him, I can't say any of it, I just freeze. Like during our akward silences, I'm thinking about what I want to say, you know, how much I love you and want to be together and my fears and stuff, BUT I CAN'T ON THE PHONE. That has been my worst thing, confrontation, I can say stuff over the net or text, but it's really hard for me to face to face or on the phone.  Maybe it's because I'm afraid of the reaction or sounding like an idiot. Typing things, you can't see or hear the other person, so it doesn't matter, but on the phone and stuff it's all out in the open. I guess I just need to work on this stuff, be more open with my feelings, try not to hide them, be able to express myself without worrying about what the other person might think.  I'm going to go talk to my GIR now, yeah that's right I talk to a stuffed robot in a dog costume, what now?! I love my GIR :)   Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together And I just wanna stay with you In this moment forever, forever and ever
