So I was very clever walking home, I managed to get half way across the field but then my umbrella started dragging me off (you had to be there) so I put it down and I put it inside my bag :) Oops, I think it might of been the lack of sleep getting to me because we had a family get together yesterday. Then I got to my front door and thought about it (it took a long time for my brain to react) My great Aunt's 85! Wow! Happy Birthday to her for yesterday! I got to see my Auntie's kittens yesterday! (My actual Aunty) hmm Aunt? Aunty? Aargh! They were sooo cute but erm soooo round! Ours are long and thin and hers are short and stubby! (Aww) And here's are only 10 days younger than ours! (I think something's gone wrong with Brodie though, he still looks big and compared to my Aunt's cat about three times bigger!)
