I skipped all the lessons on Monday, and sat in my room, with my Biology textbook and revision guide, and studied from 9:00am until 5:00pm. During which I took several small breaks to the loo and one large break to lunch including internet time of 30mins. After that I went to tea (dinner).  After 7:00pm I sat in my room with my Music Anthology and Past Papers and revised until... 11:00pm. During which I took several small breaks to Elisabeth's room.  After 11:00pm (lights-out time), I took a flashlight and revised the musical definitions under my covers. I finally fell asleep at about 1:30am. Then this morning I woke up at 6:30am to study for Music again.  And guess what, the exams were so bloody easy!! Especially music. I wondered why I studied so much for it. Biology Modules 1  2 were also easy, but Module 3 was quite difficult (may also be that I didn't actually get to finish revising for Module 3)... but overall it was ok.  Yeah, I got a Math Pure 1 exam tomorrow, but it's easy la...
