I'm sure you're the most beautiful angel up in heaven, you were the most beautiful angel down here on earth.  I know you will be always protecting me and our son,you're the best thing that could have ever happened in my whole life and I'm so glad I met you. I thank you for everything you did for me, and I apologize for the fights we had, and for hurting you, cuz I know I did at some point. I'm sorry. I will always love you,my beautiful.  Love, Kay.  ~A memorial to Danielle~
