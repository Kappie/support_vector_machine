Like I just read the bbc and it was about that president that got assisnated and thats what I thought it said...yeah :)   Today was mums day! Yeah.  We had to get a present for my aunt so we went to nordstrom and I kept seeing all these people I knew. It was kinda freakky... First I saw a girl from my rowing team..then this girl from CAM. Then Lauren. I was like "whoa hey..people go away!"  Thats a cool saying. It kinda ryhmes. I got the coolest sunglasess at nordstrom. They are like totally rockstar shades. Plus, they were only 10 dollars! I am really tempted to wear them tomorrow with my "I heart pad thai" shirt :)  After nordys we went to the buffett thing. It was at the Heathman Lodge. Purty place.   I ate so much. And my cousin, David is obsessed with Paul Mccartney!! We are going to stalk him together. he was like "Its my life goal to meeet Paul McCartney" and I was like "Wow..me to!"  Then there was this guy there and he was probably my age. And whenever I went to go refil my plate he was ALWAYS there. It was a little creepy. He like followed me in the food line... then when we were leaving he was leaving to! I was like "Hmm"  When I got home I just used the computer for ages then I gardened for an hour. I love my garden. Its purty! I can't wait to put all the flowers and such in it. How exciting!  Now I am just being bored...I am gonna study for my science test purty soon. :)  Adios Amigos!  Laura Fantora
