Well to everyone but the groomer, who asked my dad when he went to pick up Pepper and Lucky if we were sure we wanted to take her home.  Apparently she does not know how to react to certain noises, whatever that means.  While Lucky is still being protective of us they play together now and follow each other around.  Pictures to come as soon as I figure out what went wrong with photobucket.  I realize that my blog has deteriorated into impersonal statements of daily matters.  I'm just physically and mentally exhausted and socially deprived.  Hopefully everything will be right after a good real weekend.
