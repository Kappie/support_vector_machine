And just kidding about that math major all, jeezus. I hate math, I'm just good at understanding it.  So if everyone couldn't tell, I'm in a bit of a mood, and that's never good. Most of the time, I develop these little things and they tend to bleed out on everyone else. So yah.  The rest of this post is going to be what is known as a "rant". Linds's BLog is called as such, and it reminded me that I haven't ranted or used the word "fuck" on this BLog in a long time. Not that I expect that anything will have changed by the time I have ranted or used the word "fuck"...to the greatest ends, no less...but I'm wanting to do this so that I'll feel better.  And again, I'm mostly expecting everyone to pass this part up, seriously. I mean, BLogs are really meant for talking to yourself, especially the EMO kid side of every BLog. Not that anyone actually does...what can you really say to these kinds of things?   So that is the disclaimer, and if you're going to keep reading (and I promise there's nothing special, and there won't be any names used, not that I'm pissed at anyone anyway), be my guest.  So...I hate myself. As hard as this is to really accept, I hate the way I've been wired, which is, in essence, myself. My family has a predisposition to the worst kinds of mental deaths, the least of which is depression, which is a constant and horrible knife in my back. It ruins every function of my life, relationships, grades, ambition. A couple of weeks ago, I was probably on Cloud 9 about this time, and a few weeks before that, I was probably sinking lower and lower as I took the labours of breathing.  The point is: I can't control it, and I can't understand it, and neither can anyone else. It helps my maturity and sense of humour, when I'm not in the middle of being depressed...other than that, it's a curse.  I can tell when it's kicking in. I'll always be in the middle of a sentence, and I'll start to trail off and lose interest in what I was talking about, or I'll be trying to say something I find funny, and just drop the reigns on it. Then I'll start to really loathe myself for how I'm becoming and it'll only get worse and worse as it goes.  Speaking of maturity, that shit drops off pretty fucking (that was the first one) quick. I make the dumbest connections to why I feel the way I do, and why people are reacting differently to what I say. Fuck (and that was the second one), I  know  why, but I still sit there and worry about it, knowing what the hell is up.  I like psychology because it lets me know why I feel these things. I don't like psychology for the same reason. It lets me know why and reflect on what a commonplace freak I am.  It's not the common part that gets me. It's feeling isolated and knowing there's a thousand people with the same damn problem...it feels selfish, and giving to that selfishness is something I have to do, but it makes me feel horrible nonetheless.   So I deal with it. I spend time alone with it, I cry about it when it's bad enough, sad as it is, I just don't know what else to do sometimes. Suicide typically always occurs to me, but not as a reality...as in, it comes up, but I never consider it in reality. And the saddest shit is, it happens everytime, and that's horrible. I hate thinking about it.  Honestly, life is really great right now, and that's another reason why I hate myself. I mean, everything is so even, I have the best girlfriend that could've ever been imagined, I'm doing ok in school, I have friends, I have a decent family.  Oops, I found out that someone is doing better than me in something, time to get depressed! Oops, guidance people say you need to get involved to get accepted into college, I'm not! Time to get depressed instead of getting involved and actually doing something about it! Start thinking, you're too stupid to get in on intelligence, you're not going to know what to do on the essay, you're going to fail anyway, so why not just quit and  kill yourself now  before the rest of your life does?  And THAT, friends, is shit. I don't like thinking that way, but inevitably, I do.  I keep waiting for myself to make some faulty association between two things and depress my brains out because of it...fuck. Just waiting and waiting, knowing that I should stop waiting but I can't. It's depression.  It's sad because, chances are, I'm going to be schizophrenic in the very near future...in case you didn't know, that's going to really fuck me over. It's happened in my family, it happened to my biological grandfather (who killed himself, by the way) and his grandfather (who also killed himself, if I'm not mistaken)...I'm a prime target for it, or something to that effect.  I mean, come the fuck on! I have a life to live here!  It kills me to watch these guys who don't care about shit, who langour in infidelity and debauchery, and they come away morally scot free. How the hell? A piece of me wants to be that whoring fucker that I detest so much, sometimes. I figure I wouldn't be depressed.  Then I get to be normal again, and say to myself, "That would be more depressing, living that way. And killing yourself is a bad thought, so I'll  never do it again ."   So when it does happen again I get really fucking mad at myself for having lied. If I were to tell a bit more about my past, you would find lying to be a great and murderous part of it, the likes of which I would aspire to damn from my being, but no...I lie to myself to make things better, despite my knowing that the fix is always temporary, no matter what I do. Just like anyone else.  I aspire to be my own person, and that's definitely dampening that. Imagine the struggle trying to recover a sense of self after Leigh Anne. Imagine the fear of becoming that lost self  again . It's terrorous, even. It's worse now because now, I would know what was going on before it happened and find myself not able to stop it, again. At least, that's what I think. But I'm in "pretty down" mode as of now and of course, every thought that comes out is a negative one.  Most of the time I write these things away...I can't this time, for some reason. It's like all the music was taken out of me, and here I am, left to die with these wonderful little chips of anger on my shoulder.  Just now, I typed, "I HATE I HATE I HATE" and deleted it. But that's just a part of my ID longing to come out, just like he did before, when I didn't really care.  I'm trying to keep this under raps guys, I really am. I didn't like what I was last year, and I'm fighting it with every single fucking bit of my essence. And that creates a lot of negative sentiment at the same time, which I am forced to fight with simultaneously.  I wish I could describe this all to someone, but it's one of those things you can't put it to words if it's true enough. It's like love, if you really believe it, you can't say it, you can't even show it, you just know it's there, and it's real, you acknowledge it and you deal with it the best you can.  But even those that provoke the best of my words (and there are no names, but you all can probably deduce, if you're still actually reading) couldn't draw all this out, I've made it too complicated and I'm fighting a war that shouldn't have ever started, against myself.  It's a horrible war, having the entire world on your side, every confidence you could have ever asked for, and somehow, just somehow you're losing that fight, you're dying fast, you don't know why, you won't. At first you think there's an answer and you go looking for it, but actually, there never was a question, so you're reaching out for something that's not there, and that's where your constant depression comes from. I've since staved that, now it just comes back in sprees when it wants to.  I just hate the way it makes me feel and interact with everyone. I feel it taking a toll on my life. As if everyone couldn't guess where my thoughts are now, going to that primarily important and strange and new aspect of existence.  It is my fear that this will take its toll. That only drives it onward.  So that's about it. What more could I say? I fight, by God, I fight, and I hope that some day I'll understand all of it. I'll keep praying for a solution, I'll try to hold on to my loves and passions without letting the depression taint those too.  I just hope I can stay true to that chivalry.   Wow, that's quite a lot. I hope you didn't read all that, because you'd be just as much of a loser as me for writing it all for no apparent reason.   Whining is good within reason. Hell, you're mind produces things typically horrible for your body, but does it with reason. We should all be adhering to that wonderous natural logic.   This is the end. I'm going to bed now. Goodnite all.  I feel much better, by the way, if anyone couldn't tell, or cares at all, if you were worried at the suicide part.
