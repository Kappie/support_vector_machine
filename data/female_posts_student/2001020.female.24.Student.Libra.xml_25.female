Tomorrow is it, this is it. I am never ever going to see him again. I am going to be relegated to a girl from his past, a lesson he learned, and that will be that. I hold no place in his future, and I guess he really holds no place in mine either. I can't say I feel great about getting to have that position. I'm a chapter that's already been read, I'm a thing of the past. I'm distraught over this. I know that this is the closure that I need, but I still hope for us. I cannot help it! None of his decisions have made any sense to me, even a year after the breakup. How many years will it take for me to forget about him? My friend K was in Kent this past weekend and she said people said nothing but good about me. Not even an inkling of bad sentiments from anyone. If that is the case, then why am I alone? Why am I always suffering? Why is it the things that I want most elude me until I'm blue in the face? Law school, love, happiness...I may have complicated thoughts, but I'm not hard to please. I only ask for some of the things that people have and take for granted. I could appreciate them, and I'm certain of it. Why can't I have a chance at any of them to know whether or not I would really know what to do with them? I don't want to meet anyone else who's not into me like M. I don't want to get my feelings entangled in someone who's not capable of losing themself to someone. I just want something to work, dammit! Geez. I guess I'd better finish closing out my life here and get my worldly possessions into the boxes and bags and other storage mechanisms where they belong...I'm returning to the status of "nomad," as I have lovingly nicknamed myself after the past year of my life. Always roaming, always alone, searching for something...
