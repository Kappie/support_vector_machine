Often, because of this, my weekends were devoured by their careers - going to SA events, preparing for church the next day, etc. This particular Saturday was no different.  We were at a small Christian Book Store in Paramus, New Jersey. They had these pencils with Jesus' head as the eraser and I just  had  to have one. I asked my mom and was denied. So I tiptoed around the perimeter of the store to where my dad was. Flashing him my best puppy-dog face, I was denied again.  So I took matters into my own hands.  Looking around, I crammed the Jesus-head pencil into my coat pocket. Then, in a brief moment of generosity, I picked up an Abraham-head pencil and did the same. For my brother.  We left the store and went across the street to Burger King - our reward for being good while our parents shopped. After we ordered, my brother and I went to get a table while our parents waited for the food.  It was then that I unveiled my prized Jesus-head pencil.  "Mom said you couldn't have that." My brothers jealous eyes glared from across the table. "Relax," I told him, "I got you one too." As I produced his Abraham-head pencil, I felt the pride bubble up inside of me: I had done something nice for my brother.  Well, apparently he had something against Abraham, because quicker than I had shoved it into my pocket just minutes earlier, he already had run to the line and come back with my mother.  To make a long story short, I got a lecture on stealing and was brought back to the Christian Book Store. I had to apologize and promise not to do it ever again. And I didn't.  Until the next time we went in.  This time it was a pack of "Disciple Cards" that caught my eye. Well, it was the same story. Both parents said no, so I pocketed it. Afterwards, we went to the  same  Burger King and after my brother and I ordered, we went and found a table.  Looking back, I should have held out until we get home, but I couldn't. The excitement was too overwhelming. I took out the cards and began reading them. I think all of New Jersey heard my brother announce, this time without actually leaving the table, that I had stolen  again .  Like the last time, my parents took me back and made me apologize to the old woman who worked there. Once again, I had to beg her not to call the police. I was forgiven, although my parents were asked not to bring me back, as I was now a repeat offender.  So there is a small Christian Book Store in Paramus, New Jersey that I am not allowed in. I'm not exactly sure what would happen (or even if this store is still there) if I went in, but I am pretty sure it would go something like this:  I would walk into the store and the door would shut behind me, echoing for dramatic effect. As the door slams shut, all the lights in the store would dim and turn a reddish hue. A deep voice, without a definite location would bellow, "I knew you'd be back. Just as I knew about Eve and the apple." And then the building would starts shaking. There would be cracking and popping noises as pieces of drywall fell into my hair, and I would have a sinking sensation. At that point, I would pass out. When I awakened, I would learn that the earth had opened up and swallowed the building (and me) whole and that I was never going to get out. I would spend eternity stuck beneath the plates of the earth. All alone. With no Jesus and Abraham-head pencils, and surely no disciple cards to keep me company.  That said, I'm not going to risk it.
