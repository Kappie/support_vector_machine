BUT i am making money.  and that's the only reason i'm there. working in the lab is tedious.  i hate it. i really do despise work. but i guess i shouldn't be complaining. i know a lot of ppl who want work..and don't have it.  but this is just a summer deal. but i wish i wasn't wasting it. i don't like having nothing to do. makes things feel worthless.
