Well obviously for sexual purposes its a gift, otherwise its like a very bad friend. One of those friends who stears you in the wrong direction, Gives you bad ideas and leads you astray.      Once the penis is in control it takes over. Im sure you wonder what the hell i am talking about?      I have just got back from a cottage with my boyfriend and his family. I had a great time, i really did...apart from a few things. No sex for two weeks due to the fact we had no condoms. It wasnt really a big deal, we could still have fun.      It was very hot at the cottage and being in the sun makes you very tired, and maybe even give you a headache as it did me. That night in particular when i wasnt feeling so good i was ready to go to bed. I was not up for the fooling around we did on the sofa as i did not feel very well. I tell AJ im off to bed and he flips out.      He was so angry at the fact i didnt feel well and that he wasnt going to get any. Fuck you. :Growls: I told him im not well, and he sulked like the big baby he is. I got angry and was like fine, ill stay and then i'll go to bed. He was like "im sorry". Your sorry? Your sorry for keeping your sick girfriend up just so you can have some fun. What an idiotic, arsehole kinda thing to do.      The penis was in control. Thats what he says. It definatley has a mind of its own, and over powers his actually mind. Can you see why i'm angry?      This wasn't just on one occasion but on a few. If he didnt get any every night he sulked. It made me so angry.      My conclusion: The penis controls which is why guys are such jerks...most of the time.      DramaQu33n
