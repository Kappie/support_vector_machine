I'm beginning to feel hallow, wanting to almost carve out my remaining insides and show them all I was never lying. I am truly nothing and no one can argue with me now. I believe I've actually forgotten how to give a true smile... I try but it burns and scorns... I want to wash away my eyes... I don't want to see this shit anymore, while your at it there are a pair of ears close by that don't want to hear your shit anymore either... I'm slowly falling apart...
