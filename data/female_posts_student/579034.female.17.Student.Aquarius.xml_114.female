To show the world the new Lauren, here are  urlLink before and after  pictures. They need a bit of whitening but, they aren't half bad. I'm really happy with them. Plus, I got to miss school today and the whole Florida plans are set and Mick's plan for commin here are like looking really good. Lets just hope school goes well and my arm heals quick and I can run Manhattan College and then all of outdoors with out killing myself. That would be good. Very good. Okay.. thats that. Peace x0x!
