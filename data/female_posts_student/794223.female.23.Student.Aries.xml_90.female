This is a very small town, but the rest of my family is here ;-)  I'm stuck in a little corner between boxes, floor to ceiling.  There are over 500 of them in our new house, about 200 of them in the game room alone (books).  I have been unpacking non-stop since 8:00am this morning.  Tomorrow's going to be another long day...  Hello to all my friends back in Austin--I miss you already!  I will come back to visit before I head off to New Orleans in August.  I've got to finish unpacking my room, and then I'm going to take a nice bath and go to bed (finally!).
