It was nice to get away but I kept getting the nagging feeling from recent events though they faded away after the first day. Eastern Washington is beautiful. I've never really seen any other desert besides that but I still think it's great. My mom finally found Chief Josephs grave. We went to the first cemetary and looked around. I was chasing grass hoppers when I stumble across a small old grave. I stopped and crouched down to read the tombstone. It had a name but I've forgotten it now. The dates on the grave were something like: October - , 1912 to February - , 1914. She wasn't even two yet. I wondered how she died, or if her parents had another baby. If a couple lose a child so young and then have another, do they eventually forget about the first one they barely knew? Do they still come to the grave? No... They'd be gone by now. No one else knew her except for those people. No one comes to rest flowers on her grave. No one remembers her smiling face. God the mound where she was burried was so small. It's sad to think that someday while I rest everyone who knew me will eventually go on and forget or die off and then no one will come to my grave anymore.
