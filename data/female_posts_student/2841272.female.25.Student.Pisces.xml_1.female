Not because of the legitimacy of you arguments, or the strength of the proclamations you made, simply because we are putting a few of the discussions to bed and I don't want to drag them out anymore than you do. So with your Josh Schwartz "one word disagreement" I will concur with you, I do think he is on the verge of something big, and you obviously think he is strolling down the right path. You must give me one thing though, you must concede the fact that Josh has started off better than any writer(TV or movie) that has crossed our paths in a long time. As for the Eisner thing, maybe I see a connection between two people that I have a serious dislike for, Eisner and Dubya, that doesn't truly exist. But I do think Eisner would be hard pressed to put a check in the Kerry box come November.  Now to the new aspects of your latest post. The White Stripes, I must admit, I do not listen to them. I have tried but they are not my particular cup of tea. So trying to argue against your superior knowledge on this topic would surely not end up in my favor. Although I do believe Eminem is quite creative, I also believe that he is possibly one of the most over-rated performers in the music industry. He has created some of the original and cutting edge songs I have ever heard,  I am  is one of the darkest and most insightful songs in the last twenty years. But the esteem most people hold him in is absolute garbage, he is not the greatest thing since sliced bread, he is a rapper who has an original sound, nothing more.  Michael Cunningham and Eric Schlosser...Absolutely no idea.   I should've expected that you would bring up Courtney Love, but it completely shocked me. You must have known that this would not be topic that would sit well with me. I have a seething hatred for Courtney Love, and maybe that blinds from this so called creativity, but what I see is a drug-addicted alcoholic with therapy bills that have to be running in the millions of dollars. When I listen to any of Love's music this is what I hear: She tries to play the guitar(which she fails miserably at), her scratchy voice reminds me of the woman you see at the end of the bar who has smoked three packs a day for the last thirty years, and her lyrics she could have stolen from a 5 year old girl who was crying and yelling at her parents in the next room. I agree with you that Britney and Christina have very little talent, but Courtney has less. Remember one thing - Madness is not creativity.  I mentioned in my last post that I would comment on the state of the magazine world so here I go. I agree with you 100%. I obviously have a different taste in magazines than you do(I wouldn't be caught dead reading  Vogue  or  Vanity Fair ), but the magazines that I used to like have gotten incredibly weak in the last few years.  Sports Illustrated  isn't exactly pop-culture(though I think sports does play a role in pop-culture), but it is now scandal driven, and articles are written about players in which the press either adores or hopes to tear down(ie. adores Tim Duncan, despises Barry Bonds).  Entertainment Weekly  is an occasional good read but it's only constant is Gliberman/Schartzbaum, the second best pair of critics out there.  It is a pretty bad state of affairs when only after four posts I have run dry on people I think are creative. Now there are probably people out there that I have not thought of, and that's my fault, but there is a serious lack of creativity in Hollywood today. This will be my final post on this topic, I look forward to the next topic and I would like to know if you think creativity in tinseltown is as rare as I do.
