She doesn't know it, but I read her Live Journal, and I cannot believe the kind of stuff that she puts in there about me. First of all, she is always so mean about people. Not really mean to their face or anything, but just mean when talking about them or mean behind their back. I think that it is definitely jealousy. In her LJ she said a bunch of stuff about how I shared things with Hunter that we "secrets" between us. It is such bullshit. Can't I tell a guy about "Badger, Badger"? And the other day we were talking about how I gave Hunter Donnie Darko, and all his friends watched it and liked it. Then, she was all talking about how it just isn't cool anymore because it was fun when not that many people new about it. So then I was like, "So you can tell Denise and lots of other people, but I can't tell guys about it. So, that's it. That is only 5 more people." She is just being so stupid. In her LJ she called me an airhead, and said that when I talked to her, all I did was brag about stuff (mostly Hunter). For one, I am not bragging, and the only thing that would make her perceive it as bragging was if she was jealous. Second of all, what if I want to talk about Hunter? What if that is what is on my mind? Shouldn't she be happy for me or something? If she was having a problem with this shouldn't she have confronted me instead of saying all this stuff about me? Then, she complains about how I got pissed at her and wouldn't talk to her for the rest of the day when she said that she isn't going to Germany. We had been planning this all along! She was half the reason that I signed up to go! If she hadn't signed up, I wouldn't have signed up! The only fun person going is going to be Emily; Matt isn't even going, and Hunter is going to Egypt at about the same time as Germany. He really wants to come.
