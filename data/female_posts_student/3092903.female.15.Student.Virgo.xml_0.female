Like today I found out that one of his favorite bands is Radiohead, which I am completely in love with. He has every single one of their CDs. That really rocks. I wish I had some of their earlier stuff. Once I can afford it after a few weeks this summer, I am going to pick one up, because all I have is OK Computer and Hail to the Thief. But that was really cool that we shared that in common. because I love talking about Radiohead. Just because their so innovative and keep reinventing their sound in these really ingeneous ways. Yeah, Mike bought me this CD of some band that I dont really know who it is...Bad Religion (?).. I think I've heard of them, but its probably just another Atheist, hate God, conformist punk group. I'll have to check it out before I make my final judgement. I'm by myself tonight and my parents are at some dumb party. I think I'll call Sara later. I miss the boys, they're so much fun to hang out with, besides the fact that I have crushes on a few of them, but I guess I'll just have to do without tonight...(sigh). Well, I'm going to go get started on The Crucible and Sophie's World after I see what Sai is up to.
