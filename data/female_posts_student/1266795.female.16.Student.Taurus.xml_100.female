However, the thought of hot weather, shopping on Rodeo Drive, Japantown (and Chinatown), and seeing Nat overrides my feelings for you all.  But yes, I must say that today's WestWingCon was great fun. I had a wonderful time meeting, talking with, and laughing at everyone today. Still, though, there must be some rules to follow while I'm gone: 1) People must blog. I want something to return to! 2) Jane! You must e-mail us all back! We're waiting! 3) Nathan and Ash, please try to keep yourselves off each other in public places! For goodness sake! But yes, Amaris is leaving. I bid all of you farewell. Good night.  "I never tire of being useful."
