Right now im watching the rock countdown on Mtv2, and so far its been Breaking Benjamin-so cold at 10 and Franz Ferdinand-Take me Out at 9 and Yellowcard -Only One at 8. I love that song,i like all of they're songs, butI can relate to Only One very very well. So anyway, i've been working on another song on the guitar its called 'Say Anything' by Good Charlotte all the chords are like C F C F so its pretty easy. Last night i thought my fingers were gonna fall off cuz i was playin the guitar for like 3 hours straight. Dad helped me on the first verse: i kept listening to like the drums instead of the guitar part so i was messing up pretty badly lol, but thanx to dad now i dont really mess up anymore on that song. Oh and franny- that song by Mest, its really good and its super easy to play but, i havent really listend to the song very much so i dont know the beat or whatever. its like C D G kinda chords. ok now Blink-182-Down is at 7. I might as well just list the countdown today since i have nothing else todo but it gets boring after a while....once you've heard Linkin Parks-braking the habit about 10 times at 1, you get bored of the countdown lol. ouch,,,im still sun burned by the way i just wore a tank at the beach walking around for about 10 mins and thats how i got sunburned and it sucks. Oh ya and GREAT NEWS!!!!>>>>>Crystal (my cousin) got the job for Lane Bryant and she's on this HUGE poster thing in the window of the store!!! She's like in a phone booth holding a phone and looking out...its so great. If anyone wants to, just go on the website, it is:  urlLink http://lanebryant.charmingshoppes.com/  she's on the front page of the site. She's on a few other pages as well like 'new arrivals' and the ponchos page. And grama even told us she's going to Africa soon for a photo shoot with this designer. When keith saw the poster, he was like 'omg!!!' it was funny. Im really glad to see that she's doing so well now that she's over that 'straigt modeling' she looks so much more...normal. thats a good thing.  Beastie Boys-Triple Trouble:6 ok welli'll write more later. bye for now.
