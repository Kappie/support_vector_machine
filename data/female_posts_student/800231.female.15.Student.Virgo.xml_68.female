Suddenly I hear someone yelling, I turn my head to see the most ridiculous thing I'd seen for weeks. Some dude was marching proudly down the street, wearing a clown's nose, bunny ears and face paint and holding a box of Trix cereal above his head. He was pointing at the cereal box and smiling like an idiot. Several people were yelling after him, but he just pointed to the cereal, gave everyone a thumbs up and marched on. It was brilliant, I seriously wanted to get out and join him. That was quite possibly my soul mate. Or at least someone from my home planet.
