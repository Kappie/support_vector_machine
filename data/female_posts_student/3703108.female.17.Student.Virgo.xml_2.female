We were supposed to go to Maria's party together on Saturday because neither of us wanted to go alone because we wouldn't really know anyone. I asked her over and over if she was definitely going because I know her and I know she always ditches me when it comes to these things. She kept saying that she really wanted to go, so I believed her. I had two other parties before Maria's on Saturday, so Deanna didn't have to be ready to go until like 4:00. So I called her around 11:30, when I was on my way to Nicole's party and her Mom said she was still sleeping. She woke her up and asked her if she was still going to the party with me and she said she forgot about it. I figured she would still go because she still had over three hours till the party. So I called her after Nicole's party, around 2:00 and her Mom said she was laying down because she didn't feel good. Deanna never feels good when she's supposed to go to a party. Anyway, her Mom said she would have her call me. I went to Aimee's party and Deanna never called. I left the party around 3:30, ready to go to Deanna's house to pick her up, and I called her again and her Mom said she just walked in the door and Deanna wasn't home and she didn't know where she went. And that's the last I heard from them. Deanna always does this. I don't know why I put up with it. I guess we've just been best friends for so long that I'm scared of losing her. I'm scared of not having a best friend. I know she's not gonna call me. I'm gonna have to call her or else we'll probably never talk again. But I really don't wanna call her because I'm mad at her. She should call me and apologize. Just like last time, I'm not mad at her for not going to the party with me...I'm mad at her for not even calling me to tell me what was going on. I told her over and over that I wasn't gonna go to Maria's party if she didn't go with me and I went out and bought her a present and everything and I didn't even get to give it to her. Anyway, I have to go do laundry. I'm pissed.
