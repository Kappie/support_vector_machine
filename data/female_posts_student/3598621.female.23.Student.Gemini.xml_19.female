Topics: - Work-related: what she does; how she likes it; how long she's been working there, etc. - Family-related: what her family's like; what they do; whether they're close, etc.  - Hobby-related: what she likes to do in her spare time; what she does on weekends, traveled anywhere special, etc.  - Pop culture-related: mention whatever's in the news lately. "Did you hear about what happened in England?" Or ask him whether he's seen the latest James Bond flick.    Talking about the weather - Beautiful day, isn't it? - Can you believe all of this rain we've been having?  - It looks like it's going to snow. - It sure would be nice to be in Hawaii right about now.  - I hear they're calling for thunderstorms all weekend. - We couldn't ask for a nicer day, could we? - How about this weather? - Did you order this sunshine?   Talking about current events - Did you catch the news today? - Did you hear about that fire on Fourth St?  - What do you think about this transit strike? - I read in the paper today that the Sears Mall is closing. - I heard on the radio today that they are finally going to start building the new bridge. - How about those Reds? Do you think they're going to win tonight?  At the office - Looking forward to the weekend? - Have you worked here long? - I can't believe how busy/quiet we are today, can you? - Has it been a long week?  - You look like you could use a cup of coffee. - What do you think of the new computers?   At a social event  - So, how do you know Justin? - Have you tried the cabbage rolls that Sandy made? - Are you enjoying yourself? - It looks like you could use another drink. - Pretty nice place, huh?  - I love your dress. Can I ask where you got it?  Out for a walk - How old's your baby? - What's your puppy's name? - The tulips are sure beautiful at this time of year, aren't         they. - How do you like the new park? - Nice day to be outside, isn't it?   Waiting somewhere      - I didn't think it would be so busy today. - You look like you've got your hands full (with children or goods).          - The bus must be running late today. - It looks like we are going to be here a while, huh? - I'll have to remember not to come here on Mondays. - How long have you been waiting?  Practice: - Keep a journal. Write down funny stories you hear, beautiful things you see, quotes, observations, shopping lists and calls you made. That story of the long-distance operator misunderstanding you could become an opening line.                                                                 - Talk to yourself in the mirror. Make a random list of topics and see what you have to say on the subjects. Baseball, Russia, butter, hip-hop, shoes ... the more varied your list, the better.          - Be more social and talk to people.                                                      - Keep a few exit lines in mind too. For example, "Thanks for the wonderful chat, but I must make believe I'm interested in everybody else."                                 The key to breaking the ice: "You don't have to be brilliant," Carducci says. "You just have to be nice."    The best opening lines relate to something you have in common. A simple observation on your shared environment will do; discussing a mutual interest is even better.    If someone introduces himself or herself to you, avoid responses that will stall the conversation. Without rambling, mention something your co-worker can ask about. If you've just returned from vacation or recently taken a new job, say so.    "Give them something to talk to you about," Fine says. "Throw the conversational ball."   - Before arriving at an event where you'll be networking, spend a few minutes brainstorming conversation topics. Staying on top of current events helps. In a pinch, skim your newspaper's sports section and check out the book and movie reviews.   - Always have something to say when people ask you what's new. "Not much" is the wrong answer. Similarly, when asked how your weekend went, "fine" isn't good enough.   - Visual cues also work. RoAne likes to wear unusual pins that serve as conversation pieces. Hanging pictures in your office or cubicle can help, especially if they tell people something about you.    Most importantly, smile. Put your conversational partner at ease, and the chat will flow.     go to this ESL site for more http://speaking.englishclub.com/small-talk_practice2office.htm
