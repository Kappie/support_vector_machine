Seeing pictures of myself at all ages and with family and friends who impacted my life led me to reflect on my life and the blessings in it.     One could say that I led a charmed life as a child; my childhood was carefree--idyllic, even-- and I was never burdened with the worries of so many children in the world. The pictures showed me the ways in which my family, my church family and my community impacted me and shaped the person I am today.     The first set of pictures I came across were of my family and I. There were baby pictures of me being held by my parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, aunts, uncles and others who nurtured me and loved me. I was actually  always  being held, which  might  explain why I talked at 6 months but didn't take my first step until I was about a year old. ;-) There were pictures of me as a child playing with family members, learning how to interact with people and feeling completely confident and a stranger to vulnerability. There were pictures of family holidays, pictures showing a family that was thrilled to be together and thankful for every day of life we'd been blessed with.       On my second box of pictures, I came across pictures of the people I'd been surrounded by as a child in church. I saw photos of my friends and I at church activities and photos of the adults in the congregation that made all of that possible. I saw pictures of myself being encouraged, edified and treated like a person with a purpose, even when I did not seem capable of doing much more than running around sweating or coming up with new ways to be a smarty pants. These were the people who taught me the value of service to others and showed me Christ's love through their own love.    The third set of photos were taken at the Buna Redbud Festival, South Jasper County Little League Opening Ceremonies, at school and at other important places and events in the sleepy little town of Buna, TX. Growing up in a small town gave me a unique perspective on life. I am of the opinion that a small town is a wonderful microcosm where the residents learn about loving picture and have a special understanding of human nature and the types of people who make up the world. In my small town, I saw compassion for the helpless, colorful personalities, and the value of community.   These photos reminded me of all the things that made me who I am and have shaped the way I view the world. I am thankful for Kodak, that I can go back and see these memories in living color, and I am thankful for the people who gave me these memories .
