In my big comfy bed with my crazy doggy.  Because he's so warm and sleepy when it's sleepy time.  He always wants to be doing what everyone else is doing.  Even if that's laying down and not being awake.  Good thing he doesn't run with the drug crowd.  He'd be a junkie doggy with a tendency toward freebase and rolling.
