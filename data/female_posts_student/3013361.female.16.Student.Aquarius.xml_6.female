A great love story that made me cry twice and I'm not normally the crying type. Starring Ryan Gosling (Murder by Numbers) and Rachel McAdams (Mean Girls,The Hot Chick) its the story of two people in love but society's standards could not accept it. Taking place in the late 40's its a touching story. You must see it. Guys will hate it but girls will love it!
