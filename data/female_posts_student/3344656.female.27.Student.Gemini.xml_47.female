I hope I get paid this week or I may cry.          It's been a funny week so far. I truly have very little awareness of what day it is. Let me reckon it out... I think it's Tuesday. Last night I had to go to Petco to buy more dog food (see previous post), but I had to go to another city. Because there isn't even one Petco in the city of Denver. I was so annoyed, I didn't really know where the store was (other than Sheridan and 88th Ave), and I drove around that area for almost an hour before I grew a brain, called 411, called them and asked where they were. In the meantime, I'd made myself carsick and sort of started growing a migraine. In my annoyance (mostly with myself for not paying closer attention when I was looking at the store location online) I swore more creatively than I'd have though possible. I suggested the City of Westminster do things to itself that are anatomically impossible. It was nearly art.          But I missed the first 30 minutes of I love the 90's 1990, but saw all of 1991. It was fun... Hal Sparks is fun. I even like Michael Ian Black on this show.          And I have been obsessed with Bravo in general. At my house in CA, I didn't get Bravo, so I'm newly into Queer Eye... I also love Blow Out (I actually love to hate Blow Out), and have become fascinated with Celebrity Poker Showdown... I even understand Poker... finally. I'm still a tiny bit fuzzy on the betting, but by and large I understnad what's going down.          Okay, thus ends my TV ramble... Except to say there here, its' really nice that Whose Line on the Family Channel is on at 8 instead of 10, so I can stay up late enough to watch it!          Jill told me the next season of Alias wasn't starting until January... After the last season (which sorta blew except for a few shining moments: "I was in a tangent once." "How nice for you"), I'm okay with that. JJ Abrams is all busy with The Lost, I suppose.          Okay, that really ends my TV ramble.
