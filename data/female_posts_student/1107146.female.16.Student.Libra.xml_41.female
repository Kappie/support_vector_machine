And that fact that he says so and is being so fake...well...I just can't take fakeness, or arrogance, which he has in abundance. Like today when he called Alex stupid for not knowing a Calculus problem. He's probably the only geekass on the fucking planet that knows the answer to that. And then he jibed at him. Alex was just doing it for fun, but Gunter didn't have to react like he did, "I'm better than you because I'm a senior and I know more math stuff and you can piss off and suck me you underling". SO GAY. I wanted to fucking BLAST him today. And I wanted to throw the Gilgamesh box at you too for being all "HEHEHE" at him.  Yet I  know  he isn't over it (I was like him a long time ago, the "sutble flirt"), and if you're being all overly nice to him and trying to get into his head like you are he's going to take it the wrong way.  I can't tell you to stop, because I wouldn't listen either in that situation.  But I'm telling you to look to the horizon so as to prevent the present from closing in.
