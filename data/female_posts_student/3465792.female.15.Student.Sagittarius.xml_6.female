It was about then that I realized that I had left my money, a home. Great day so far.so. got woken up early, (12;50pm), couldn't pick up my book, bikes a piece of shi*, got cramps going on, and I forgot my money. The good news is that I now only have $8 dollars on my card and I found a giant cat fish in a stream near the library good for a Monday though way, yester-night at the very stroke of midnight, my radio turned itself on! I was highly surprised as I was reading. I also felt a warmth in my chest. Two minutes later, my folder fell! I think it was mainly me, but I think my old friend, The Presence, came back these "dreams" happened when I was half awake me explain... At the end of December last, as I was waking up around midnight (I have really odd sleeping habits).. In my dream------. I was sleeping on a mat that had four chairs surrounding it. I was at a sleepover and my friends were sleeping on the chairs. I dozed of then re-awoke in the corner of the room( which was very large and had nothing in it) and it was my be. There was something over me and it was naked to my eye(invisible).It was very malevolent and I could feel it as an aura. I was under the blanket and my head was to the side. IT began to blow/whisper in my ear. I tried to cover it with the edge of my pillow but couldn't. I tried screaming and thrashing but I had no control over anything. I then got control of my arms and tried to hit it but there was nothing there to hit! I being myself was never afraid of it but I hate being controlled finally left and I awoke. my second dream goes like this----- I was in my room sitting on my mattress talking to Aaron on my new phone when I felt it enter nearly rushed in and I felt it coming and knew what IT was. I was going to tell Aaron about it when it got control over my voice. I struggling fiercely for a few seconds when it left my room. I was wondering why it had left me without doing anything to me when it rushed at me again. It did this process 3 times I awoke and got angry with it then marveled at how it was doing this and for what purpose. the third one occurred as such on Monday, January 5 or 12------ I was in my bed in the same position as in the waking world, body straight and fingers clenched. Suddenly, the PRESENCE was at my side. Not malevolent in any way,but there. I tried to talk but again, I couldn't. IT began laughing and then IT spoke! IT's word went something like this "You don't have..." and the rest was lost as I awoke.  those are my PRESENCE 'dreams'. I know that they aren't just dreams but something of a another sort. I have nothing to influence them in any way. No movies, conversations, pictures, nothing. It might just be a poltergeist *tucking* me out from my slumber. Whatever IT is, its as if its testing me... kinda. In the first, it enchants me by whispering in my ear. Then it tests me of my strength, then it even talks to but of what I hope to learn. Then it checks upon me periodically. What does this mean? Why me?Oh well, why try...?
