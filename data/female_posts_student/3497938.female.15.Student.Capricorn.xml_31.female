He always makes me laugh. When he was leaving he gave me this big hug *well, I have to stand on my tip-toes to reach him, lol* and a kiss. It was so sweet. And our friends were around, and he didnt care. That means alot to me. We are workin out pretty good, so far. And I think we could last for a very long time. At driving tomorrow we have to take our final exam. dum dum dum! Im sooo nervous and afriad I wont pass. Then on August 6 and 7 I have to drive to Atlanta with Ted. yay! NOT!!! So yeah, im still on my 'mark high', lol, and I dont think I have been this happy in a very looong time. I like this feeling.   Mark, if you are reading this I had such an awesome time tonight and I miss you already.
