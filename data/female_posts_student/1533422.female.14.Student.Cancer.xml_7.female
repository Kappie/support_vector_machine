What is up with you reading my blogs, dude?) cuz I want to rant on about the people making my life hell right now.  Clare - fallen out with me, and acting like a cute, hurt animal to everyone else so they're all on her side.  And is pretending to be in America.  Charlotte - having a bitch fight with everything and everyone for no apparent reason except, according to her, we're pissed off with her.  Lucy - in America, and therefore doing nothing, so I get blamed for bitching about her.  What?!  All of the above - have been bitching about me and my best friend, had a sleepover without us, and are just generally worthy of thirty-four slaps each.  MSN - signed me off and won't let me back on and Bob's online!! Why, cruel world, why?  I am soooo annoyed at the world.  All except Pooj, and she isn't allowed to come to or have a sleepover, but a movie night is a possibility.  I'm just getting agitated writing all this.  But I must let it out.  Oh my God - Clare majorly fancied Dan even after he was being his worst to me.  And she wonders why I'm annoyed with her!  *Whispers* it's a little thing called self-respect, girl ...  You will get sucked in by my blog.  Resistance is futile.  Later, honeys!  *~x Jools x~*
