Does he still want to remind folks that he invented the internet? Is he under the impression that he still has political pull.  The overweight and bearded Gore was much cooler than Robot Gore.  At least he had that crazy unibomber thing going for him.  The West Wing makes me want to work at the White House.    urlLink
