I found myself with a heavy heart. While the normals went about their routines, I felt akward and isolated. Perhaps the anticipation for break was beginning to wear on me. In any case, I spent the evening about in my PJs and enjoying the sweet melodies of another sufferer on the stereo. I thought my uppers and downers were over. I suppose it is all a state of mind.   I am deeply longing for the sweet morning of Christmas. The open fire hearth and cheery smiles of the morning should broaden my spirits. Until then I remain melancholy stationed in this position.    "And then she realized...they're all the SAME!"- notepad I looked over at a darling boutique in Sanoma. On the notepad, there is a woman accepting two different arms from two different gentlemen. Quite intriguing.
