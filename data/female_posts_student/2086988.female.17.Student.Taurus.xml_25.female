Plus, no history hw this weekend! Wee!!! I hardly have any hw at all. Whoa, yesterday during rehearsal we were making each other black out and I did it 4 times and then I did it once tonight...not a good idea...I keep wanting to go to sleep...so I'm going to find something to do to keep me awake. Ok, well I really don't know what else to talk about...too many lost brain cells, lol...   Forever walking through December Forever longing for a sign of life, a bringer of light
