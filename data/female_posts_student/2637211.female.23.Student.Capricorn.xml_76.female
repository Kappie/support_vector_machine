Interesting to have Friday the 13th the day before Valentine's day too. I hadn't even realized it until I read Liz's away message. I think I need to call Liz something else... since she's an Elizabeth, I feel like I can get away more with weird nicknames. What about Liza? Or Betty? Bessie? Libby? Lizard-Breath? I always liked Eliza. It's such a cute nickname, with so much more personality than Liz. Liz is a boring, run of the mill shortening of Elizabeth. When I was in second grade I went by Beth. On the first day of school, the teacher asked if we had any nicknames to go by, and I surprised everyone, including myself, and said I liked to be called Beth, even though no one had ever called me that before in my life. I'd only been called Elizabeth, Lizzie-toes, and Lizard-breath. Oh and my dad called me Bob-tot. Not really sure how that evolved, but he still refers to me as Bob... that's right, Alex called me "Bof-boss," which was because of my mother trying to get her to call me Beth-beth, to be cute. Must have evolved from that. I always called myself "Ebis" when I was little, and I guess I still think of myself as Elizabeth. It's such a weird thing, what people call you, it becomes such an important part of how they identify you, but you are able to respond to so many different variants and combinations of your name. In track, everyone called me Liz, and once I was wearing an initial necklace with the letter "E" and someone asked me what it stood for. Elizabeth!
