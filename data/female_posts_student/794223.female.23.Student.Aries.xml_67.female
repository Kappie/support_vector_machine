I have been earnestly praying for several days now, nearly always in agony and to the point of banging my head against a wall, "Lord, please take these evil thoughts and temptations away from me.  I hate them; erase them from my head!"  Then the Holy Spirit said to me, very quiet and when I wasn't looking:  "Rejoice in your temptations and struggles!  The devil would like to discourage you and bring you down with guilt, but your Father wishes you to gain strength from your trials and temptations."  And then I realized that I had been praying, in a way, for the wrong thing.  There will always be temptation and evil lurking around us from all sides, at least until Christ returns.  My prayer is not so much that my Lord would take all that away from me (although that would be lovely...), as that I wish for Him to provide me with strength to RESIST temptation.  If God provided Jesus with the strength and courage to resist the temptation and overcome the sin and guilt of every human being that ever was or will be...think of what God can do for me in helping me resist lesser evils!  Also, I was reminded that temptation is not sin.  Yielding to temptation is sin.  Satan was making me feel guilty, wretched, and as if I weren't a strong enough Christian--for the thoughts that he put into my head in the first place!  Tricksy, he is.  I firmly believe that attacking new Christians and making them feel like crap is his personal favorite past time.  Well, this is all I have to say about that: "News flash, ass hole: I am a child of God, and you are the father of lies, deceit, and guilt."
