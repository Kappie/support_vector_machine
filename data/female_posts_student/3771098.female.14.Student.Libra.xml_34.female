First of all, mi hermano y yo had to wear these red lanyards with UM on them.  It stands for unnaccompianied minor.  I felt so retarted wearing it but what can ya do.  Oh!  I didn't make the alarm go off!  It was awsome.  So i got on the flight and my little brother sits in front of me.  I have some chinese guy yapping on his cell phone in chinese (the worst language in the world.  It's so harsh sounding!) for like the entire flight to the left of me, and then there was this girl who was engaged but looked like she should be in the 6th grade sitting to the left of me.  No one talked.  No one was friendly, but good news people!  No people in turbans.  Hallelujah right Ted?  So the seats on the plane are scratchy.  I would know this because i wore a skirt with a thong so literally my entire ass was on this scratchy seat for 3 hours.  No me gusta US airlines.  So we finally got there.  Oh yeh, they don't feed you on planes anymore!  You have to pay for your food!  How gay is that?   So i'm in denver now.  It's pretty cool i guess, minus the whole not knowing anyone but my relatives.  I mean i love my three cousins, but how much can you do with a 9, 8, and 5 year old?  Tomorrow we're going on a 14 mile bike ride.  Of course, my aunt runs 18 miles every morning cuz she's training for some marathon.  I swear, i think i'm gonna' die!  The time change is kinda' screwing me up, i gained two hours coming here but what's new.  I'll loose two hours coming back and that'll really suck.   Britt had this thing on her profile so I'm stealing it from her (gracias!) and it's awsome.  It's got a ton of cool quotes in it and it's called an interview with God, and it's not gay like a ton of these things you see on peoples profiles so heres the link:  urlLink http://www.theinterviewwithgod.com/popup-frame.html  Check it out.  It's muy bueno.  Well i don't really know what's up with me right now, but have you ever felt like everyone knows you, but they don't know the real you?   That's about how i feel right now, more or less.  It's a weird feeling. (sorry this is so random guys, just clearing my mind)  It's crazy, and it's kinda hard to explain.  It feels like I want to open up to people, and be myself, but i'm too scared to.  And the weirdest part is, I can't decide what scares me more; not opening up to anyone and then having no one know the real me, or opening up to people, but then getting hurt.  I hate getting hurt.  I know no one likes getting hurt, but i avoid it at all costs.  WHY IS THAT????  God, how can anyone begin to understand me when i can't even understand myself??  No comprendo.  It's like i feel all alone, all the time, even though i'm not.  It's the wrost feeling in the world, i do believe.  I mean it's not like i'm depressed or psychotic or anything, it's jus that sometimes i don't feel so great, even though i might not show it.   So i guess everything's good at home cept for this tropical storm thing that's going on.  What's up with that?  Hey all you SD ppl, what are you doing for your reflection?  I'm a little lost on what i'm gonna write so any help would be much appreciated.  So I found a really great quote today, here it goes: *You can't make anyone love you--all you can do is let yourself be loved* I believe that would be my new favorite quote.  So i'm out here in Denver, the only true southerner and ppl look at me soo funny when i say ya'll, which only encourages me to say it more.  haha.  Well I hope everything's going good at home with everyone.  Apparently some people might be mad at me for some gay ass reason but you know what?  I frankly don't give a damn.  Well That's it people!  Love yall.  Liz
