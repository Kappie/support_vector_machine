What shall I do with my allotted time this day?  Reflect.  That is why I decided to create this thing-called-blog.  Over the years I've ignored my brain and my spirit, forgot I need room to stretch out my wings and dust off the webs.  Mere intellectual study is not sufficient.  Minds need circles of thought before they can arive at new geometric anomalies of wonder and unchartered territories.  In my thirst I feel I've become someone I have never admired...shallow.  Does my spirit only run ankle deep?  I don't know myself anymore, so how can I expect my loved ones to understand me?  Depth.  ░░OxYgEn░░ Be truthful and ye shall find yourself within.   What will you do with this day?
