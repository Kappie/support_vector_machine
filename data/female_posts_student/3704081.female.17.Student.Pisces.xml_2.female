I was at her house last night for about 5 hours just talking. I told her the story about me and 6 other girls getting stuck in an elevator at our  urlLink hotel in Madrid ,(that's the backside of the hotel in the picture) and  urlLink the fountain with the lions...  she got a kick out of that one. I think we're suck good friends because she's another one of those "happy kids" like me who just doesn't let stuff get them down.  *Brush your shoulders off*   (In the words of Christine...her and her rap music.) But now I'm leaving and have to travel some more. Yay.  I'll be home on the 24th. Go to  urlLink Wildhorse canyon  sometime, or  urlLink Malibu . Or go backpacking at  urlLink Beyond Malibu . They're freaking awesome!    Back in a week!
