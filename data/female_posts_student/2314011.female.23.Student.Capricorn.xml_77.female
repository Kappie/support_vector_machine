Who knows what kind of mood I'll be in after four (4) hours of class/Internet database research training/Professional Conduct lecture by the Dean/another class, so I better post something to commemorate my good mood.    As you can probably tell, they didn't really miss a beat with the return to school.  And while that fact had me questioning my existence last night, today I feel ready to tackle whatever they may (and will) throw at us, as long as I can have my Grape Nuts and coffee in the morning, and Yoga and tea at night.  God, I DO sound earthy!  I'll have to start drinking more beer, I guess.    Final word on the GPA: 2.83.    My friend Dan's over here chatting with me.  Say Hi Dan:  hi i am writing for andrea she is wicked smart.  Says he who has a GPA in the 3-point range.    "3.42, actually," he corrected me.  "He's such an arrogant little prick."  "No, Dan, I wouldn't say that.  But I'll type it."  Alrighty...off to class.  Wish us luck.
