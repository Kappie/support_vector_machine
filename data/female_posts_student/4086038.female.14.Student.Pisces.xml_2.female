Maybe I can go back to being as happy as I was before. Maybe, I can forget everything and be me again, and be happy again. Maybe God has put me through this test to see how far I can go. For me to grow and to see that there are other things in life that I should be happy about.  I thank god for everything. For making me learn a valuable lesson... thanks.   "I don’t have everything.  And I definitely can’t have everything.  Pero astig parin kasi aliw ang buhay..."  - urlLink Chio   so true... so true...  and now, I'll go back to what can be my old life, and move on... and continue to grow. Because life is a challenge. And the challenge isn't over yet... it's just beggining...Ü
