So in the morning I did my part of compiling the report for the meeting.  I was almost done before Colleague D (i shall refer to him as such) asked me for it.    Me: oh?  ah not down yet....I need to get the data from W (the office clerk). He: what?  And then you simply just sit around like an idiot and wait?  if she doesnt give it to you can't you go find out whats wrong? Me: *offended....what the hells wrong with him?* I get it from her around this time..oh shes just not around on her desk now anyway.....*still in well composed voice* He: dumb...I bet you never bother to find out why she was late?  Maybe she forget?  Maybe she was on MC?  Don't you ever bother?   ((WHAT THE HECK WAS WRONG WITH HIM?!?!?!?!  EVEN PROVIDED YOU NEED THAT FROM ME YOU JOLLY WELL ASK AND NOT YELL AT ME!))   Me: shes not late yet.....besides I have other stuff to do.....  *JERK..HE THINKS I WORK FOR HIM OR SOMETHING?!*  anyway a little later i grudgingly passed the stuff he wanted and add in the meeting:  ME: *soft whisper*  I REALLY DONT APPRECIATED GETTING A SCOLDING EARLY IN THE MORNING. -__- HE: WHA?!  *EYES WIDEN, I IGNORE HIM*  HE DIDNT LIKE IT, SO HE PULLED ME TO DA SIDE TO SETTLE THIS OUT OF THE MEETING.  HE: that was NOT a scolding!  HEY..if i wanna scold ya it would sound 10 times worse?! Me: -__^  (like you have the right to scold me eh?) He: FINE....go complain to your boss about me...feedback to him la....why bother telling me? me: look...I'm just looking for a bit of cooperation. HE: NOW WHOS NOT DOING DA JOB?  WHOS NOT COOPERATING????  Me: whatever...you do it then!  bye.   He doesnt know how to do it anyway and just cos it expects it of me hes acting like a jerk.  he also told my boss about me being insecere on another occasion.  aghhh...he can rot in hell!   Weirdo.  I'm leaving tomorrow.  Do I truly care what the shit happens to the plant?  NO!  I'm just passing time!  So with that kind of attitude I can simply dump the work aside.  ^0^
