Well it all started when i decided to join a senoir womens RECREATIONAL soccer league...that word recreational meaning that i would have to put any effort whatsoever! skip 2 months of half ass playing and we get to this past weekend.... Not only was i guilted into playing a tournament in moncton..i was forced to sleep in a tent the nite prior to the games. This to any other person is fine .... but here is my beef with tents 1-It's a f*ing peice of nylon covering you from the outside world when you sleep 2-I don't care if it says it's waterproof...it's not! 3-weird french ppl still smell in a tent! 4- I want to beat whoever decided that camping was fun sober...get out now we get to the actual tournament...when it says recreational non-competetive ..that does not mean stack your team full of university soccer butches 6 feet tall....there jsut gonna kick me in the face....so the weekend in a sentence... I'm a goalie and i love muddpuddles...NO! Yet the moral of this little story is not that i have a broken nose....it's that none of this would have happened if i was employed....where are all the chauvenist guys when i need them?  P.S. I banged your mom
