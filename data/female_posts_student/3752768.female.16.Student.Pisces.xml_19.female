We get there at 10 when the doors open and me and Sami wanted to go ride the SpongeBob 4D ride. Yeah we never got to. Sami was sick so I hung out with her because I didnt want her to be by herself.   Ryan wanted to go ride the Titan and I didnt. When we all met back up I ended up seeing Ryan Fig. it was a hi, bye kinda thing. So me and Sami and Renee all went to ride the log ride. Then we went and rode boat ride that swings up anddown. Ryan and the rest of the group sawus and Ryan waited for us.   Me and Ryan got into some fights but we were ok I was just in a mood I guess. But everything worked out.  Thenme and Ryan wenttoride the BATMAN!How sweet me and my man riding the batman. In the line my friend Daniel wasgetting all thesegirls numbers...it was sofunny. Sothat ride was over and then it was offto the concert.  When wegotto the concert me and Ryan wanted to go ride rides but Becky told us NO! So yeah...then we found out that you could leave the concert and then come back. But whatever it was fun anyways :)   We got home and Ryan spent the night and then everything was FUN!
