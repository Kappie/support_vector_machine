I spend at least a hour on that site at a time!! it is a  good  thing  no one is here  or else  I would be  in trouble for being on the  computer  for so much. I have a really nice pair of  boots  on that site.  mhmm... I really do  love  it there. :) lol yes I  am pathetic  but I have  already stated  that many many times.   la la la  la la la la. I  should probably  go clean my room...or do my homework ...argh... I really dont want to.  lol it is funny . the only time I really do clean  my room  properly is when I am  mad.  Then I  vent  all my  anger  on the  messiness  of my room and make it  all sparkle  like.  *grin*.  yuck! I havent  cleaned  the stuff off of the  ear I  pierced   myself for  two days or something  and I am doing that right now and it is  all scabby  and  crusty.. ugh. I am all  alone  on the computer.. how come  no  one is ever online ??? wait...I signed out  didn't I ...lol. I am an idiot...well .....I  dont have anything to  say again...
