They have yet to develop a respect for me. I've given them alot to respect! I show up on time and on the days that I am sceduled. I don't understand why I have to subsitute work for someone who doesnt do their job- Why can't they just schedule me more hours? I have no problem showing up when im scheduled- I just don't appreciate it when i get a call at 7 in the morning with a voice on the line saying.." We  need  you to come in and work". Not to mention I usually have stuff scheduled when they do it. But, their are some cool people that I work with...very few, but still cool, that I actually enjoy working with.    Second on my list of complaints  Power outages.... yea, why do transformers have to go bad and leave me and my brother without electricity for an hour?! I can barely keep my brother entertained as it is with electricity, But today I had to recall every card game I had ever learned just to keep him, as well as myself, from going crazy. After we had finally exhausted every card game known to any card book, we finally dragged out the chess board. After about 3 moves, and my imminent doom near (after three moves? yes it's possible, mind you I have had no sleep...) a miraculous thing happened (my spelling improved? Nope, sorry not this time.) The power came back on! To celebrate our great joy my brother and I jumped up in excitment and reset all of the clocks.... *cough cough, I hate power outages*   Lastly on my list of complaints  Why do people have to be so...so...self-loving? Everytime I say something to this un-named person, they look at me as if i'm stupid, or losing my mind. This "person" is only a year older than me... how can she possibly justify being superior to me because of their age? Also- my academic achievements... squat, just because she goes to a nice public high school and takes all of the higher level courses doesnt mean that she's better than me. If only I could be unprofessional for a day I would give her the low-down on what's eventually going to happen to her if she keeps up the nasty little attitude towards certain people. That's right- She'd be shocked right out of her freaking socks if I actually opened my mouth and give her a little taste of reality, I am a person, I do feel, and despite the fact I don't talk at work.... I do talk and people usually don't like what I have to say. I wonder why.   Ok so I'm done complaining on the most part  How bout I tell you about my day. Other than the power outage it was somewhat uneventful. Except! *thematic music* I had a near-tragic event that occurred while i was making dinner. Lets review- No sleep, work, and power outage- I lied, my day was eventful. It was a bad day, I will admit it. When this event happened I was residing somewhere in my right brain, i seriously dont know what I was thinking when I did it- I mean subconsciously, I knew what would happen, but I couldnt react fast enough... still wanna know what happened? (the suspense must be killing you..) I pulled out the pork chops... smellin yummy and looking tasty, I remove them from the glass container. I think- hey! I'll get the dishes done before my dad gets home. So, I put the glass dish in the sink and unknowingly reach for the cold water faucet turner-on-er... BIG mistake. For those of you who don't know what happens when you pour cold water on hot glass, look in a chemistry book cause i don't have time to explain the process. But to make a long story short, the glass container EXPLODED... good thing I had quickly exited my right brain at that time and jumped back- or I could have had glass embedded in my arm. I called my mother and said "You have to promise not to get mad, just know that brother, the dog, or myself were not harmed." I'm good aren't I? My mom said- It's ok, I've done many a stupid thing in my life...just consider this a learning expierence. I did as I carefully scooped up the 3,000 glass shards that the glass container was know reduced to. TIP: When cleaning up glass shards- its a good idea to protect your hands with thick rubber gloves and make sure that the glass is thrown into a triple bagged bag.  Ok, so that's it. BTW- I will be updating my pics sometime tonight. Im also think of adding a song of the week too.... hm hm... I dunno.
