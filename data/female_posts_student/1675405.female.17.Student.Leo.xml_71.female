And I guarantee she'll complain about the garbage cans being out, even though I pulled them a good 5 feet away from the driveway. Ah, the woes of a new driver!  Actually, we have an NHS meeting this morning at "Mugs," the local diner for those who wish to be seen by rising members of our thriving little town here. Not my top choice, but hey, I get breakfast and I get to see some of my friends. Not to mention finding my genius friend Doug Walton because I think we might be going to see Matt Kidd play at Jennifer's Coffeehouse tomorrow night in Conneaut. Still have to find the number for my mother so she can call and make sure they don't "serve alcohol," because you know me, Jennica the hidden alcoholic.   Wish me the beginnings of a great day!
