Where has the summer gone?Ah, but that's not the point... it's mambo time... time to get up and dance.  But first a little warm up. A little I say... You think... Musical style... I'm going to post 10 words... and you tell me what songs or bands these words make you think of.  jazz:  Miles Davis  white:  "White Christmas," the Bing Crosby version  goodbye:  Spice Girls (don't ask)  summer:  Alice Cooper ("School's out for summer")  avenue:  "Ocean Avenue" by Yellowcard  hungry:  "Hungry like the Wolf" by Duran Duran  blue:  "Blue Moon"  moon:  "Moon River," from  Breakfast at Tiffany's  (aww... I lurve that movie!)  fire:  "Ring of Fire," by Johnny Cash  bird:  "Free Bird," by Lynryd Skynyrd (I  am  from Alabama, after all)   Now it's time to get our mambo on....are you ready?  5 bands that you can't live without:  Def Leppard, Counting Crows, the Eagles, Steve Miller Band, and Smokey Robinson and the Miracles   4 albums that are important to you:   Ray of Light  by Madonna;  Fields of Gold  by Sting;  August  Everything After  by Counting Crows; and  The Hardest Part  by Allison Moorer   3 of your favorite songs: " Brown-Eyed Girl" by Van Morrison; "Maybe I'm Amazed" by Paul McCartney; "At Last", by Etta James   2 albums that you've bought recently:   Recovering the Satellites  by Counting Crows (for a friend) and  The Stewart-Mayfield Project  (a local Birmingham band)   1 Band [or Artist] whose music has would be described as writing the soundtrack of your life:  Aimee Mann (especially the soundtrack to the movie  Magnolia) . Her lyrics are so poignant and true and full of gut-wrenching emotion.      Ok, chicos and chicas, get to mamboing any style you chose. (I prefer Italiano). Remember it doesn't have to be Monday to mambo. Mamboing is fun on any day you choose!!!
