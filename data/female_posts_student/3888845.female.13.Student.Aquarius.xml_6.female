My sister, Kayleigh , has invited her friends round today, Amy and Becca, to watch battle Royale. Its really good, well I liked it any way! :oP     I'm now listening to Evanescence everybody's fool its one of my favorite songs.  I'm cleaning up as well because there is loads of food packets around me because I'm really hungry!!! Kayleigh is doing my head in as well! She is playing on Age of Mythology! (It sounds quite good, but she has the volume on full blast so you hear annoying sound every 5 seconds).       Got to go.         ( Its lunch time!)       Bye x x x
