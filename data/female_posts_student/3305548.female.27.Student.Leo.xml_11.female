(I did mention complaining about being poor in my blog description...consider this a mini dose...) There are few stores around here anymore. The ones that have survived the Wal-Martians invasion are STILL big corporations anyways....and they charge MORE for everything. We can't afford shopping at KMART even...or sometimes cant afford shopping at Krogers (which has almost vanished from our local landscape...they used to be my favorite place to shop...) We certainly cant afford the Giant Eagle across the river in Ohio, nor could we afford the BigBears (now all four area stores are gone...) when they were here. Foodland? HA! IGA? HA! The health food stores? DOUBLE HA! I grew up eating the organic foods and health food store goodies. I CANT AFFORD THEM NOW!!!! Ug. Right, so Wal-Mart it is. There doesnt seem to be anywhere else to go really anyways. Even Aldi's cant be trusted on prices....they run out of things so fast that by the time you get there their advertisements were empty messages and a person just wasted gas driving a few miles past Wal-Mart for a bargain that wasnt there anymore. Evil empire.   Soon we will be moving to an area that, although there are Wal-Marts, there is alot more competition. I am pretty sure the Wal-Mart in our new town will not be a Super Wal-Mart. Thus, there are plenty of grocery stores still in existence to choose from with fairly low prices.  My mother in law drives all over town following the mark downs and coupons. Soon she will realize that the fuel she is burning is more costly than getting that double coupon.  Gas prices = 1.99 here. 44 cents or more of that is tax from the federal and state government. We drive a Jeep Cherokee. We drive less than 1 mile per day for the last two weeks. We use 25$ worth of gas in 14 days. Thats 14 Miles. Thats one mile per gallonish. How in the hell is that possible? Needless to say I want to trade in the gas guzzeler. My husband clings to being able to look down on the other drivers in traffic from his SUV seat. Its his vehicle...but the gas prices are going to kill us. I will continue working on my mission to get him to trade in the Jeep for a more fuel efficient car in the upcoming weeks. I welcome any suggestions.  --Mack  PS: Its so late its early. I am going to head to bed. Night night.
