I'm a bit concerned about that issue. I need sleep, and I'm most certainly exhausted at the end of the day- and yet I cannot sleep. I awaken continuously throughout the course of the night, and I finally fall asleep as soon as my alarm clock sounds, but it is too late to do anything at that point.    On a side note, I am infinitely hyped up about Honor Choir this year. I can't wait to go. I love our music muchly (well, excepting one piece), and I have heard great things about the director. I'm generally hopeful and excited to get to do something I love for a weekend. If you're a lover of choral music and have nothing better to do on Saturday night, come to the concert-admission is free. It is at the Clayton County Performing Arts Center at 6.30 pm. Tuesday there will be a Workshop at Spivey Hall for music education and such. I hopefully will be able to attend, as I really want to. I would need to miss an entire school day; therefore, I shall check to be sure that anything I miss will be easily made up. I really really want to go.    I had an intriguing verbal engagement with Katie today. I wasn't sure such a thing could ever happen, but it did, and it was a nice and satisfying conversation with words being spoken on both ends, as opposed to the usual scenario of my speaking until I am dry of speech. We talked about anthropological behavior and overall flaws and virtues as well as modes of communication and expression.   It was rather enlightening, considering that, throughout my school day, I hardly ever have a chance to exchange any meaningful ideas with anyone.    Yesterday, I had to telephone Charter because my internet was acting screwy. The assistance girl who picked up asked me to repeat the process of unplugging all cords from the wall although I had already attempted that route of action. While we were waiting to restart everything, I asked her how she was doing. I assume that this girl was in desperate need to speak her mind to anyone willing to listen, and she did. Synoptically, she and I conversed for approximately 30 minutes. I think we both needed that, and I was immensely grateful that I was able to somehow, even if in such a minuscule way, aid this girl in oh-so-much distress.   Then, I was connected to technical services, and the man I spoke to was rather rude and of no help, as I wound up figuring out the problem on my own anyway after he told me he could not help.    Random thought that popped in my head just now: I am a damsel in distress daily as I attempt to close my locker. And I had earnestly convinced myself that that would change with the new semester...   Well, I should really go begin my homework now. So, I leave you with a bow as I post the lyrics to a marvelous song.    "Smoke" by Ben Folds Five  Leaf by Leaf and page by page Throw this book away All the sadness, all the rage Throw this book away Rip out the binding and tear the glue All of the grief we never ever knew We had it all along  Now it's smoke  The things we've written in it Never really happened All of the people come and gone Never really lived All of the people have come have gone  No one to forgive smoke We will never write a new one There will not be a new one Another one, another one Here's an evening dark with shame Throw it on the fire Here's the time I took the blame Throw it on the fire  Here's the time we didn't speak It seemed for years and years Here's a secret No one will ever know the Reasons for the tears They are smoke  Where do all the secrets live? They travel in the air You can smell them when they burn They travel Those who say the past is not dead Stop and smell the smoke  You keep on saying the past is not dead Come on and smell the smoke You keep saying the past is not even past You keep saying We are smoke
