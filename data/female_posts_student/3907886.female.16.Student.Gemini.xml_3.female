And what's more than that, I slept for 15 hours!  I can't belief it.  But I'm still trying to deal with my odd feeling that I woke up with.  Last night I fell asleep crying for no reason at all!  And this morning I still feel sad.  Well, not so much sad anymore, but just numb.  Why is it that when people decide to be mad at me, they seem to get mad at me in mass?  I can't stand being on bad terms with people.  No matter what the reason, I seem to always be drawn towards fixing, and improving our relationship.  However, today, things aren't the same.  I feel numb, and don't really want to make an effort on my friendships/relationships with people.  I know that it sounds horrible, and I feel horrible for wanting to do so, but I just need a break from all of the pressures, and feelings that come from relationships with people.    fortunately for me, this weekend I get to go to Spring Green.  My family and I are gonna meet some really neat old friends from St. Paul, MN.  They are awesome.  And what's even better, we are gonna see the American Player's perform.  They are an outside Shakespearian acting company.  Last year in RSA, they came and performed   The Taming of the Shrew  .  It was really good.  We are also gonna stay at a bed and breakfast.  Sleeping late, being in a new, calming environment, and spending the day outside in beautiful weather seems wonderful.  Just what I'm craving right now.  No stresses, just relaxation and comfort!  Hopefully when I get back, I will be able to make amends with all of my friends, and life will get better!    until next time,  ~Ani
