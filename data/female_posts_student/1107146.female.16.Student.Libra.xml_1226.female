(By the way, I took some to Crockett park for my school friends and they got very good reviews.)   Anyway, I hate math.  Please shoot me so that I don't have to do my stupid power point project on math.  I hate it and I don't think that I could be more sarcastic on what I'm writing in it.  It's way to amusing.
