BUSTED were so awesome. I love BUSTED. I would go see them next year at Wembley but tickets are like £21.50 which is a bit stepp so I will just enter lots of competitions and see if I get in there that way, cos BUSTED are worth it. Oh the park. Yer. Haven't spoken to them yet. Who went in the end do we know? Yer so BUSTED were great and I love Matt Jay now, aka, MATTIE. Phor. Wahey. Start work tomorrow. Don't know when I am working yet so I don't want any of ya'll coming in trying to harass me on my first day. But you can come in to say hi if you wish. LOL.
