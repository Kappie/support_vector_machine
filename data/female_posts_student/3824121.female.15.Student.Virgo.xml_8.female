I was SO shocked when I realized that I could rent manga from the libray. Sadly out of order. Or maybe in order, I havent searched hard enough. I think i'll go back later. Maybe, somewhere, someway, I can download some lovely anime, like Naruto or the actual Inuyasha. (Mental yay dance)  On a second note look at this. Isn't it adorable:     hehehehehe!!
