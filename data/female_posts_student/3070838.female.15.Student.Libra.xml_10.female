I mean it he might make us do that or something that would be so sick. what he is a sick old man who still lives with his parents and has no hair  very interesting........... lol  And today in Geometry we had another interesting experience. Poor Austin. When Mrs. Rives was talking about two congruent triangles. Austin: What's congruent? Is that like where the angles all equal 180*?   Poor guy.
