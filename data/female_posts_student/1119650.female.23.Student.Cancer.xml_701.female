It was too big for the comments, but he was kind enough to email it to me and I'll be damned.  Its pretty funny (c:    well well, this is my first comment on the diva site....not sure what's  prompting me to do this, maybe cause my boy one brown eye is officially  a member now, and i know he will read this....anyways, i read your list  diva, and i materialized my own:  Grande soft tacos are the greatest invention of man, with fire and the  wheel coming in a close 2nd and 3rd respectively.  Just when i thought i couldn't like 311 more then i already did, a  sweet ass concert comes along and makes me fall in love with Nick Hexum all  over again.  Ben Franklin once said, "Halo is proof that God loves us."  I am slowly but surely becoming a Hubba's afficianado, next on my list  -> fried clams with chili and cheese .. "i'm SERIOUS!!"  Hornswaggled, hoodwinked, hogwash, bamboozled, and button-hooked are  all fun words to use in every day life.  The Don Labia seems to have some letters missing from his keyboard.  The Hillcrest Girls crack me up.  Taco bell is my crack, and beeks is my dealer.  bAruce (or bruceski) may not be better than tom at halo, but he's  better than tom at life  29 is the truth  that's it, i'm off like a prom dress peace/violence fockers  -wolf
