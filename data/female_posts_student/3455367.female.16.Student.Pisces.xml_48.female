Um malcolm has booked train tickets for me n Joelle for on the way back to Sydney. and he is gonna drive us there. i cant wait but i need to save up so much money to get a phone and all the JTHM comics and clothes n stuff. I hope i can get a bit off my parents ..eheh.. Anyway we r gonna stay there for 8 days and we r leaving on the the 10th of July. checks
