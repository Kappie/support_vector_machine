I really want to, but I'm not sure if I can. He hurt me so badly. It wouldn't have been bad if he let it be, but he came back and started something again, and once again hurt me. I just wish it was over, I wish that I didn't have to deal with it. "You look so hurt every time you see me, it tears me up." That's bullshit. He doesn't care. I just wish that I could know what to expect, either hate me or like me. Don't go from liking me to hating me, to liking me, to hating me. Just make up your mind. Tell me what you want from me, and I'll tell you what I want. It's quite very simple, I just want everything to be figured out, and I want to know what you want with me. I don't care just let this be over with!
