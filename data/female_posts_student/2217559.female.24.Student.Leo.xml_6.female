It was a stern voice and I started trying to figure out why I would alreayd be in trouble. I hauled ass over to his office as fast my heels could carry me. I walked in and there was my boss, Vassilis and 12 others girls in his office drinking wine. He says, "Why you don't come join us for wine more often?"  (In his broken greek english translation).  I was really surprised. So I sat down and we drank a toast to another successful cruise and to my new hire. It was awesome.   After my everyone left the formal dining hall, Kimberely (the other social hostess that's leaving tomorrow) and I went to a nice seating with all of the Mai'tra-des (however your spell it).  It was awesome. We had a formal dinner with lobster and some great cheese. It was a yummmy meal. In fact, the same that all of the VIP guests ate earlier. It was very nice of them to invite us and I was invited to attend next cruise as well. Afterwards, I hung out in the disco last night for awhile. The Asst hotel manager joined my table of 4 and so we sat there and drank some champagne. I didn't drink to much though as I didn't want to feel like hell today. It's pretty cool though - when an officer is seated at your table, all of your drinks go on his tab regardless. Not bad. Anywho, I stayed for awhile and then went to my cabin.   Today I take over everything - the mobile phone, pager and every other responsibility of the social hostess position. I am excited and certain things will go well. Oh also! I am moving to a new office in January where I will be facing a huge window of the ocean all day! Isn't that incredible? It's going to be super nice. I have met some really cool friends on board that keeping me entertained - like a woman named "Uma" from Canada and another girl named Stephanie. I hung out with them a bit last night and it was good fun.   Today doesn't feel like Thanksgiving for me. I guess I had my Thanksgiving dinner last night. I hope everyone is doing well. Know that I miss you all so much and I hope you have a lovely day with friends and family.   See you soon, Shelly
