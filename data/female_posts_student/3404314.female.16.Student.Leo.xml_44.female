These misfortunes that im experiencing.. they are the result of lack of ability, ignorance, laziness, wrong decisions, etc... the results of the mistakes ive made.. the results of deciding too soon..  well.. i really like this song by Avril.. dont know why!! Happy Ending....  Let's talk this over  It's not like we're dead  Was it something I did?  Was it something You said?  Don't leave me hanging  In a city so dead  Held up so high  On such a breakable thread   You were all the things I thought I knew And I thought we could be   CHORUS:  You were everything, everything that I wanted  We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it  All of the memories, so close to me, just fade away  All this time you were pretending  So much for my happy ending  oh oh, oh oh, so much for my happy ending Oh oh, oh oh  You've got your dumb friends  I know what they say (they say)  They tell you I'm difficult  But so are they (so are they)  But they don't know me  Do they even know you?  All the things you hide from me  All the shit that you do  (all the shit that you do) You were all the things I thought I knew  And I thought we could be   [CHORUS]   It's nice to know that you were there  Thanks for acting like you cared  And making me feel like I was the only one  It's nice to know we had it all  Thanks for watching as I fall And letting me know we were done   He was everything, everything that I wanted  We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it  All of the memories, so close to me, just fade away  All this time you were pretending  So much for my happy ending   ooopss.. bye!! still have to do my psych assignment...
