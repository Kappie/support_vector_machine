I SHOULD BE THERE. But I'm not. It's a long and painful story that a few of you already know, but I don't talk about it much.        Called Caitlin first. Her mom answered. I was okay, I was ready to tell her good luck. "Hey! May I please speak to Caitlin?" "Oh I'm sorry, she's out of town right now, may I take a message"? "Oh hey Debbie.. this is Madeline, I just wanted to tell her good luck.." "Oh well thank you so much for calling! She went down with Kim and Becca and the horses. They're probably there by now. Paul and I are flying out tomorrow." And so on....        So after that call the tears started coming. I got it together and called Kassidy's cell phone. No one answered. So I left a message. And I lost it. As I babbled on about how I hope they have fun and to kick ass, I just started crying. I couldn't help it and I felt like an idiot. So I hung up.        I went outside and started painting my desk and chair, the latest project I've been working on. A few hours later, my mom came out with the phone. It was Kassidy and Mandy. I talked to both of them, and they were laughing and having fun and enjoying every bit of Albuqerque. "It just doesn't feel right without you here!" "Well, it doesn't feel right being here." And as I said that I started crying again. I can't stop crying. I am supposed to fucking be there. But I'm not. I went and hung the phone up inside after I was finished talking and my mom asked me if I was okay and how she knows I'd rather be there. Yeah. Sure. I know you damn well know I'd rather be there. And I would've rather been at every damn show this summer than being around this lame ass town. But you're not the one who's heart is broken into a million pieces, so it's all good.        I was going to go ride Al today, but just looking at my ribbons and trophies and pictures made me bawl more. I'm bawling now. I just couldn't go out there today.        If you care about me.. that's great. I truly love you for it. Truth is, there are few people that I think genuinely care about me. Most of the people that I knowactually care aboutmecome from Kim's barn, and I haven't seen them in a long time. SoI just feel great about myself, don't I?It's about time I say it.. I don't like myself at all. I'd never hurt myself... I just dislike myself to the point that I go completely numb and cry alone uncontrollably.        Do you even know how good it feels for me to say that? I've been wanting to say that for so long. To my true friends - I love you so much. I think about you and pray for you every day. I won't ever stop loving you.     I love horses and showing and riding   so much  . I lovethem more than life itself. And I want to win National Champion   so badly  . I've come   so damn close   to it and haven't won it. I'm not giving up. No, I'm not finished yet. I'm going to do everythingI can to accomplish my dream. No insatiable dumbass is going to take my dreams away from me.     That is all.
