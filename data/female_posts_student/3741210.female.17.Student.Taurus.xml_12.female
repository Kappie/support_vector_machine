We saw the bean and we had lunch in Grant Park. AfterwardsI was pretty thirsty so we walked for like two miles to Navy Peer and I got a coke. Then wewalked to the beachrolled up our jeans, and splashed around in the water because it was way too cold to go swimming. We were so tired from the walk that we just layed in the sand forawhile in silence. Pretty relaxing actually, execpt I still can't get the sand out of my purse. On TuesdayI worked, and I will not lie, it was really hard to getthrough. Thats one thing I won't miss when summer ends. End of the month isreally bad though at First American Title. The clan surprised us at like 2:30, I guess just to drop by and say hibut theycouldn't stay for long. Jer had to go to workfrom 4-10, soofcourse at like 7we all went to hisplace of buisness and watched him push carts around.Afterwards, we hungout in downtown and met up with Rachel, Rick, Phil and some other guys I didnt know.I finally saw Catie on Tuesday.(Hi Catie! Hope Great America was fun!!)We actually thought we were going to watch a movie but ofcourse we get to Family Video and there's absolutly nothing to rent.   Today wetooksome pizza toStephen at work. We went to the park and ate it and I tookpics with my 35 mmof the clan. I don't know what I'll do with a roll offilm of the clan. Distribute them I guess. Then Stevehad to go back to workand we just kind of hung out. We went to MGPPL (Meadow Glens Park Parking Lot) and then to Ranchview to play some tennis which I'm really bad at. We also went out to dinner at Rockin Robin because eveyone is leaving for their separte vacations in the next few days. Jer to Alaska, Chang to China, Amit to India, Me and Steve to Mich, Kel to Connecuit, Kathryn's in Colorado, Kirby is leaving for her grandparents and Manmeet is going to India as well. We won't have everyone back until a few days before school so it was kinda the last hurrah. At dinner, the waiter gave me and Steve two straws because we we're sittingnext to each other,Amit informed me thatthey dothatbecausetheyassume we are a couple.(Gross!!) Then we went to Caribou, and as a laststop (ofcourse) MGPPL. We were playing the keep-the-ball-in-the-air game when this silver beetle comes sreetching into the parking lot and does donuts. Amit and Jer jumped in Amits van and they chased the beetle but it got away. We also had this white car come by and yell things, and then it randomly threw a basketball out of its sun roof at us. So quite a busy night at the park. Usually we sit there for hours and no one comes, so it was wierd having a 2 car night. Right before we left everyone talked about where they were going in the next few weeks.Except for one or two people, it sounds like everyone is going to have a good time. Clansmen, hope you have fun and keep it safe! Until next time, I bid you adieu.
