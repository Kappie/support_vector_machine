And I am wary of how he is turning into some kind of national treasure these days, but nevertheless, he wasn't all bad.  Here is a list of things I like about Ronald Reagan.  1)  urlLink His hair.   He's all, "Hell no, this Hollywood hair ain't too much for Washington."  I am only half-joking when I say there may be some sort of correlation between popular presidents and hair.  John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton.  Good hair.  Nixon?  Total greaseball.  Bush 41?  Yeck. [I can't even get past Bush 43's impish mug long enough to look at his hair, but I am sure it sucks.]  2) Reagan  urlLink set the bar for romance .  Whatever you want to say about the rest-- well, god damn.    The most memorable thing W ever said about Laura was that nonsense about  her  urlLink sweeping the porch . (For which I bet he was sleeping on the couch that night.)  3) The whole  urlLink Gary Cooper thing   was   urlLink a lot easier to swallow with Reagan .  I understand that he actually rode horses and did real work on his ranch.  Cool.  That is of course,  urlLink unlike some idiots we know .  Bottom line:  was Reagan a crappy president?  Sure!  Would I have totally accepted an invitation to hang out at his ranch and have a BBQ?  Absolutely!  There you have it. May he rest in peace, and may God's love "trickle down."
