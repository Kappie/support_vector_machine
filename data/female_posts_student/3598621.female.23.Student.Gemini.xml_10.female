Because affirmations are "statements of fact", affirmations must be written in the present tense... the subconscious can only operate in the present, never the future. Affirmations must be repeated over and over until they are internalized and become fact.   - I am always on time  - I am very reliable  - I am good with returning emails and voicemail messages.  - I work hard on her research project.  - I make excellent progress on my research, and my project is very impressive.  - I'm an active, social person.   Visualization  Visualize what it is like when I break all the bad habits. What will it feel like, what will I be doing, what will others think and how will they interact with me.  Also visualize what it is like when I finally graduate and get the job I dreamed of. How will I feel and what will I be doing at that point?
