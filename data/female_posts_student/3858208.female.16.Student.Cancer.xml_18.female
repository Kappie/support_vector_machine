I just did something that I never would have done a year, even a month ago. It's something I've thought about constantly for I guess two weeks now, but knew better than to do.    I...cut myself. It's more of scratches, really, that didn't even bleed, but the point is I did it on purpose and it scarys the shit out of me. What if I keep doing it? The pain isn't that bad, really...and the redness is so satisfying. It's kind of a criss-cross pattern with a couple of deeper cuts - still surface cuts - so it isn't that bad. Except that it IS that bad, it's an awful thing and nobody can ever know that I did this. But what if I keep doing it and eventually I go deeper, and end up being brave enough to carve words and designs and such out of my own skin? That's the only thing holding me back right now is that I'm too scared to do that. I would cut - scratch - more but I dropped the scissors and I'm crying too hard right now to reach down and get them; I can barely even see the screen.   To make matters worse, I'm afraid that I'mclose to having an eating disorder. Irarely have anappetite these days, so Idon't each much. As a result, I'm losing weight and I'm getting sick.  The very, absolute worst part, however,is that there isn't a person on this planet - except you, if you're reading this - who knows that I'm even at the point where self-mutilation becomes reality and an eating disorder is hiding out around the corner.   I feel so empty, so worthless...I'm afraid for my life.    There's nothing left now.     RIGHT NOW     mood ::  please don't ask.   listening to/watching ::  A.F.I., Sing the Sorrow   eating/drinking ::  nothing   craving ::  ...   talking to ::  nobody.   thinking about ::  blood...   wishing ::  nothing.   wearing ::  pants and a tshirt   random ::  Good-bye.
