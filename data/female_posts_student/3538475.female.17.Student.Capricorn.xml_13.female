After the exams I went into town...then we sat in town...and sat in town some more...and then just for fun a little bit more, so I went home, wasn't particularly worth my while but wouldn't have seen someone until Saturday if I hadn't so kinda had no choice.  Have discovered a yummy sandwich in subway, all thanks to sarah, so I got myself one and pigged it before the bus came.  After town I went to aerobics...it was too hot so the instructor didn't work us very hard, although she did stop me to tell me i was fading away.  Why is it when somebody loses weight they can't look good for it, they have to be fading away or losing too much or getting scarily thin ? I say they're all just jealous, it's only when i lay down that you can see my hip bones so it's no where near too much.  So all in all, as per usual, today was pretty dull so I will relax now with some beer and a couple of fags
