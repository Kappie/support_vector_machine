But it's weird, it doesn't count page views...it counts visitors. So if you view it 200 times in the 30 minutes...it's still one visitor. Crazy, huh? Hmm...well, as most of you know, I've been very bored for the past several weeks...and so I've checked out alot of websites...so I think I'll take some time to list a few of my favorites. Check these out:  urlLink No Use For A Name!   urlLink Good Ol' Bored.com...gotta love it   urlLink Free Arcade...Play Bounce Out...it's addictive   urlLink Surfing Girl.com...this is pretty cool   urlLink Gotta love the crazy Irish;-)   urlLink Handsome Devil..check it out   Well...that's about all I've gotta say...have a blast...n so on...
