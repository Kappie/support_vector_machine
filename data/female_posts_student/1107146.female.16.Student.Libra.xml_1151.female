The only thing I saw, and this is extremely nit-picky, but where it says "Multiple Sponsor      $70,000\number of sponsors" the \ needs to be a /.  That's it.  That's all I saw.  And I went in looking for things.  So, um, yeah.  I'm glad you and Kyndall got back together.  Heehee.  Oh, and one of my friends (Lindsey Baylor) gave me a book called "THe Perks of Being a Wallflower."  It's the best book I've ever read.  She said the main character reminded her of me, which, after reading it, I'm slightly offended, but still.  It's a little vulgar, and...um, descriptive...but it's REALLY good once you kind of get used to it.  I think Liz would enjoy it, and probably Abby, but I think it wouldn't be good for the rest of you, especially Rosie.  She's probably too...sheltered? I guess would be the right word... She didn't know there were drugs at Brentwood, for crying out loud (which is what a lot of the book is about, but still) anyway, Abby and Liz, I highly recommend it.  And Rosie, don't get all offended, it's the truth.  I don't think you could handle the book without having a breakdown.  Ok, I'm going now.
