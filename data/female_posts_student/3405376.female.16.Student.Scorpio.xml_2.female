What a waste of time and money. although i had KFC for dinner which numbed the pain slightly. i woke up incredibly early on sunday morning andbriony didn't get up till 11.30 in the morning. i have never been so bored in my life. Briony and i went shopping and i couldn't find anything to buy which sucked. so i was quite unimpressed. as you can tell i'm not really impressed with my weekend.
