The last time I was over there, I played the Lord of the Rings game for so long that my carpel tunnel syndrome re-developed.  I got my diploma through the mail this weekend .  I felt certain that UT would screw up once again, and do something monumentally stupid like mail it to the wrong address.  I almost didn't get my diploma because, once again, somebody wasn't doing their job.  Oh well--it's over now.  It feels so odd to really and truly be done; I feel as if I should be working on something, but I'm officially done!  I've graduated, taken the GRE, and applied to my graduate schools.  (UT and Tulane)  It feels awkward being around campus with everyone else still in school.  Not that I'm complaining; it just feels odd.  My grandparents and I spent several days with Brandi, and it was wonderful to see her again--this time in much better spirits; the last time we saw her, she was in ICU shortly after surgery.  All of us feel very confident in this upcoming surgery, because she's having the most qualified neurosurgeon in the country operate on her.  Plus, it's not like we really have any other option at this point; she can't start radiation, because radiation is supposed to cause expansion in the brain.  She has no room for expansion, due to the fact that the tumor in her head is 5 inches long and 2 inches thick.  Brandi has an unbelievable support group; hundreds of people have been in and out of her house in the past month; the people of this small town in the middle of nowhere outside of Houston have offered to help her with bills, drive her around, pay her mother's insurence, and cook and clean for her.  Brandi has received get-well cards from around the world, many from people that she doesn't even know.  A few days ago the father of one of their friends died, and he requested that in lieu of flowers, all gifts be made to the Brandi Ward Fund.  On the 11th of February, East Bernard is going to have a raffel dinner for her, and the've already sold over 600 tickets.  It's times like these when the pure selflessness of human nature does appear; this weekend we all caught my very cynical grandmother uttering the words, "You know...people are basically good at heart."  This coming from someone who gave up on the human race long ago.  It's as if God took a very tragic situation and molded it to His purpose; He knows that this family has suffered so much, and is now providing Brandi with everything that she possibly needs to get through this ordeal.  And she will--Brandi has vowed that she will not go down without a fight.  Besides...she's too fiesty and hard-headed .  This entire thing reminds me of one of my favorite quotes from the Scriptures:  "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose." ~Romans 8:28  Amen.  On that note...I better head on to bed.  I seriously need to get my sleep schedule back on track.  I keep saying that I'm going to, but I always end up sleeping during the day and staying up all night.  We need schedules for night people!
