Perhaps I should start taking more vitamins.  I need to win the lottery, so that I can give several million dollars to those that do mental health research. Considering that 1 out of 4 people are mentally ill, you would think that our society would give a damn, but they don't. Not that hundreds of millions of dollars for things like muscular distrophy research is not worth-while, but it just seems to me that we don't put mental health research on our top priority list. The mind is one of the most precious things that we have--why not protect it?  My classes are good so far, except my Spanish prose prof just likes to hear himself speak. He'll ask you a question and give you that blank stare that says "I know you don't know the answer, you ignorant child, but I'm going to ask you anyway so that I shoot you down in 30 seconds." Professors like that drive me nuts. Fortunately he's the first one I've encountered like that at UT, which is good. I fully intend to challenge him as much as humanly possible in class this semester.  On a random note, I want to marry Bill Maher.
