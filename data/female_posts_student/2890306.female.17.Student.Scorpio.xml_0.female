It may sound odd, but it's true.  I got absorbed my part, and it felt amazing.  Combine that with the energy of the audience, and wow!  Part of my luck last night was from the Lucky Penny that Jacob gave me before I went on stage.  Ahh, the power of positive thinking.  If this trend keeps up, I can't wait to see how we bring down the house tonight.  This weekend will keep me busy.  I have to work from 7:30 A.M. to 2 P.M. tomorrow, and I might attend the National Anthem auditions at school.  Though, I'm not feeling the greatest in the singing department lately, so I might skip that last activity.  Later on, I perform with the Robin Hood cast for the last time at 7:30 P.M.  It will be a great show, but sad at the same time.  Though it is always sad to end a project you have put so much of yourself into.  After the show, everyone helps with Strike (or, the taking down and clean up of EVERYTHING, for all you non-theatre goobers out thurr) and then...the cast party!  This year, Heather Burch assumed the role of Hitler and usurped the job of hosting the party at her house.  *groan*  Her parents are making everyone leave at 2 A.M.!  Now, that may seem rather late, but we will just be arriving at 1, as the set will take FOREVER to disassemble.  *sigh*  Well, the good news is, if I know my fellow thespians, we won't be discouraged so easily.  Or maybe, if I know myself, I'll just pass out on the couch after having such a long day.  Yeah...that's probably it.
