Can't sit still long enough!  I like drinking beer outside at Yanni's, guys who inspire me, being brunette, World Bank lunches, meeting people who know people, Conan O'Brien's show, Gmail, my long-ish (real) fingernails, the girls at both of my jobs, Adam's apples, the Metro, and good horoscopes.    I do not like thongs, being yelled at by Pietro, jiggly butts, feeling like a pee-on/Spanish idiot, living alone, and anchovies.
