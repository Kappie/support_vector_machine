Our school is known throughout the entire district as the stoner school. What surprised me was the fact that Steph escaped and Megan was caught. Megan never struck me as a stoner at all, whereas Steph proudly announces it to everyone. Wow...  Steph and I snuck out of Tech after attendance to get some food and talk. God, I've known her for four years now and she gets freakier every single year. The sad part is, I have this bizarre affection and loyalty towards her. She was the first real friend I made in middle school and that really meant a lot to me. The only problem is that we're very different people and I find that I have to change to keep up with her, it's at a point now that is frightening. I started smoking and drinking to be with her... I guess I've finally succumbed to peer pressure. I can't help it though. Bloody Hell...   Anyway, we spent 20 minutes downstairs and figured we should try to sneak back into Tech before Mr. F reported us dead. We actually snuck back to our seats without anyone noticing, which I think is a pretty good accomplishment. Of course we managed to attract attention in other ways. Steph pulled a strawberry condom out of her bag and asked everyone in the vicinity if they knew whether it really tasted like strawberries. Steph, James and I ended up opening it for a taste test. Mr. F walked by us, saw James with a pink condom in his mouth and did a total double-take. The looks of horror on both of their faces were priceless. By the way, tastes like a latex-covered strawberry, not bad though.   Not that my family is any better. When I asked my dad for words of wisdom I got, "It's not who you know, it's who you blow." Great, just what I wanted to hear from my dad.  I am sooo happy that it's the weekend. I love having nothing to do.
