Flora is extremely pretty!!! Prettier than any photos you can ever find because the real Flora looks a lot better. She is quite small in size, although she looked tall in the TVB series. Slightly shorter than I am. Her chin is so adorable. Sharp and cute. Nose also very pretty. Can't comment about the eyes as she had her sunglasses on. Hands are small and delicate too! (without nail polish). Very very pretty. Love her so much.
