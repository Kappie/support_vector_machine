I think that alot of things in science fiction are probably going to come true aventually. I think most of it that i read is looking into the feature.i thinik taht a lot of  the things today could have possibly been created in books and then people decided to make them real. And i think that it will continue that way. Not all of them are about the feature, i realize. Those i think just give you some way to open up your mind and see things you usually would not. But i have to go later.
