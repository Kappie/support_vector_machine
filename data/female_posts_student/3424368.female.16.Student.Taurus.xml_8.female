But yeh, I was out back for a while, and you know, it was sunny out, and the day was beautiful, so I tanned =P  I got lazy tho, so it's just my front.  I was reading my book, which I started a long time ago, and never really finished, haha.  I *was* supposed to go see Gerardo today, too... but, again, I didn't get the chance to do that.  I feel bad... cuz yeh, I know that he gets pretty bummed out when I can't make it to go see him. =( [..Sorry Baybie Boy!..]  And yeh, my dad's also being a jerk right now, which I'm NOT liking. ARGH,... but whatever.  And yeh, I found out awesome news from a close friend of myne about her and her love... unofficially tho.. but, it's in their hearts,... so it's all good! =) hehe... Yep, and right now, Roxie's sending all these sites to me, which are making me smile.. so I'ma be in a good mood when I go to bed, which will be soon =P... hehe... But yeh, this one really stood out to me... so go to it!   http://www.wordsofjoy.com/IWG.htm
