I was watchin six feet under today and they were doing a funeral and i thought if that was me and i died next week, who would stand up at my funeral? who would stand up and speak about how nice a person i was, to say oh ye i remember when this happened..because it seems like its only me who cares about the past or memories that have happened, its like its only me..    Its like I wanna do something with someone, meet up, talk, but no because they don't wanna it doesnt happen, i wanna go somewhere but they can't be bothered, but when they want to do something i jump at the chance, just because I know i will be pleasing them, what has it come down to ? Pretending to be someone else just to make other people happy.. Pretend that everythings okay now and that I ain't hurting anymore, thats what it is, because now im realising how people hate it when i talk, how they hate it how i get pissed off about something and i copy n paste the convo n mail it, or i tell them about something im feeling or saw that i thought was interesting, but they don't care anymore, because its got nothing to do with them, its just me rambling..thats all it is to them.. oh thank goodness i can block her or say im going offline, because i say no to meeting up so i got the chance to leave when im bored and fed up of pretending im interested.. thing is i kno that people hate listenin, so why do i carry on ?      Why is it that Im trying to be someone im not ? Trying to become a better person ? Trying to hide what everyone hates so much
