I just realized that other journals are full of hustles and bustles of other kids commenting on the life or the thoughts of people responsible for the said journal. I am pretty contented here, sitting quietly in one corner, writing my thoughts... seriously.          I realized that my written journal is, more or less, 25 pages short before completion... In short, I'm running out of pages. Grin...          It's Tuesday and I'm supposed to writing about trivial, nonsense stuff but I am sitting here listening to my mother and her best friend talk about the family crisis.          I have qualms about my father and everyone knows that. He has been the thorn in this family for a long time whether my mother admits it or not. Now, he's in some kind of trouble that leaves me absolutely baffled about who is right.          There is this guy,  Lemuel,  who was a long time friend of my mother. Last week, my other recieved a document stating that that, so called, "friend" filed a case against them, accusing them that my mom and my dad borrowed Php 400,000 from him... the details I do not know. But here is one thing that caught me... He accused my om for ENTICING him to get in the deal.       There is a thing however with money inside the house... My father NEVER shares his money.   Sure there is such a thing as conjugal property but with my family, THAT IS NOT THE CASE. Which means that whatever my dad "borrowed",    IF HE BORROWED   , my mother had nothing to do with it.       It is not the fact that we, suposedly, OWED money. It was the fact that he accused my mother...   THE NERVE OF THAT FUGLY PERSON  !!!       Now, let me talk of the lighter stuff. Today is a Tuesday which implies that it's Psychology day which implies it is  Kirby DAY!       Wahahahaha! nyahahah! Which means I am in love! crap!       Anyway, I started this whole painting thing yesterday. I plan to paint thoughts that I have at the moment. The thing is, I plan to make it permutatable. The edges will be continuous however you turn it, however you arrange it. I would be starting with two canvases. The dimensions are in my notebook. I plan to make lots of those so that it can cover one whole wall. But then again, I have to find a way to mount and hang it if I plan to make it a mural...... too much work... oh well... let me figure that when time comes.      Now, the dimensions of the painting will be according to the golden ratio.      By the way, about the golden ratio, I just realized something:        Suppose x and y are real numbers in such a way that x/y = phi; x>y and x1+x2=x and x1/x2=phi; x1>x2, you will realize that more or less: x1=y.   I still have to prove this though... grin...      Anyway, I have to go home now... I know that was pretty boring... hehehe...bear with me... my wits are absent today... as with every day of the week last week... hehehehe...
