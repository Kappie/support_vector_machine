I think Issy's a bit depressed, I'm trying to get her to come and stay with me in canterbury for a few days.  I think she relies to much on paul and she was really upset that hardly any of her friends could come in the end.  everyone kept cancelling so I'm glad now that I made the effort to come to london specially for her party.  I felt really bad for her.  well next year i will have graduated and will be living in london permanently (unless I can get a green card, wink wink, hint hint, lol) so I want to arrange something for her.
