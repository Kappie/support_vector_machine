And I am not sure I wantMute talking to my half sister anyway, I can't really trust him anymore with other girls because he is always sleeping around with random girls in Burlington. So if he really wants to get in touch with an old friend, he can just visit "Sarah" and have sex all night with her. It doesn't matter if Abby wants to see Mute, I say he is an asshole and he'll only hurt her if she gets near him.
