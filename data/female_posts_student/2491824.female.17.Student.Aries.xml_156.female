As I walked out of 7th period I said bye to Dan and he "Oh, I'll see you around!"... Yeah, I don't know when but whatever... Some of the nicest guys I have ever met are graduating this year... As well as some of the funnest chicks...  Eh, oh well... That's life, right?   ...And, I'm not as bummed out as I sound right now... :)
