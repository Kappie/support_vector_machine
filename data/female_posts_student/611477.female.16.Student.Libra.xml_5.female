I posted in it regularly for about three months; then I got out of the habit and abandoned it.  Today I recovered my password... but alas, in re-registering this, the remnants of my old blog were deleted.  Big loss.  Now y'all will never know that on July 18 2002, a crab bit me.     Under reconstruction - stay tuned!
