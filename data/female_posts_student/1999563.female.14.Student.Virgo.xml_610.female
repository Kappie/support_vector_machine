So, I went to youth group churchy thing tonight.  It wasn't to fun. See, my best church friend got this random boy friend while I was away. Now she is very much different and I am left to fend for myself once again.  Church doesn't seem much fun anymore, and it's not only that.  I loooooveee big church, but the highschool church is just blah. All the lessons are simple. I don't know if they think we are just young babies who can't swallow big people food or if it is just the truth of this generation.  it seems like there isn't the same love for learning that was found less than a hundred years ago. Now we are all easily amused by the flicker of the televsion set rather than the calming turn of pages from a book.   Now it's time for a break in our regularly scheduled rant for a note of happiness!  Have any of you seen my pretty purse? It's purple and it looks like a casette player? Well, I brought it to big church today [with much pricless contents] and I left it on my seat!!!! I didn't realize till we went home. But, my wonderful sister found it!!!!!! I was IMMENSLY joyous! Props to Hans!
