My friends koon n wee would definately want me to join Archery... Oh ya....during the training, I was so surprised to see my long lost primary sch mates, Daniel and Ee seng...couldnt believe that they are still close friends as ever  after PSLE...haha.  Then by the time we finished our training...its was like ard 4+pm. After that,we took a bus to West Coast Recreation Centre to play bowling....really fun but we found the lanes were abit weird...cos our bowling balls kept goin to the gutter....haha. Yup....We also plan to meet up after sch to play baSketball at Clementi next Thurs and hopefully every thurs....Hohoho...Cant wait!!!
