Fire played a decent set, could have been better, but the singer's voice was going out.  The bassist (Anton), The guitarist (Aric), the drummer (Justin), and the keyboardist (Stacy) were awesome as usual.  They didn't play my fave song, but it's all good.  The aftershow activities were awesome, but I can't disclose anymore info than that.  Want to check em out?   urlLink Check em Out!
