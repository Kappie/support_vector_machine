She has a family reunion during some of the days wed be gone  and  she doesnt...i dont want to say "she doesnt want to go" because the way she talking about it... it was more like an "i feel like i shouldnt go" which i guess means she doesnt want to go since thats how she feels... but it was more of... i dunno. she wouldnt exactly tell me why she wasnt going to go either. I think the best i got out of her was "it doesnt seem right" or something like that. which could mean lots of things and she couldnt explain. Which i  think  means she didnt know how to explain, as opposed to just not wanting to explain. So that sucks. Because i miss her and i wanted some more of that stars and pool and truth or dare and movie stuff. That was so peaceful. I could really use some peace. And we could be somehwere where it would just be me and her and there wouldnt be other friends or boyfriends or school or anything to make me jealous or to take her time or to take my time or to annoy me or... it would just be me and her.       And thats another thing...ive kind of decided (actually i think i decided this a while ago) that Emily and I are only good friends outside of school and away from most other people that we know...especially eric. Or i only feel like we're actually good friends then. Because then there arent all these other people talking to her to remind me "i have lots of best friends" and because then there isnt homework and school to be taking her away from me... and then... she's not erics boyfriend, shes not liz's friend, shes not 20468, shes not mattucci's student, shes not a distance runner, shes not a clarinet in honor band first.... she can be amanda's friend first. sort of. i dunno. i guess its more of a feeling kind of thing. which is one of the reasons whenever i want to do something with her, id much rather do it alone. I mean, first of all, cause if emilys the one i want to talk to, why bother with other people? and more people means less time talking to emily and more people means i cant say anything i want to her, and more people means more people to remind me im just one of lots of friends. and thats why its hard to talk to her at school too. so that makes calling worth something. which ive definitely started doing more so now. But, hey, if shes never going to get online and never going to email me and i hardly get to see her at school...then howthe heck do i ever talk to her if i dont call? yeah, thats right, i dont.     but anyway. i wanted all that time to spend getting to know her better... but... after begging (which i did  not  want to do but always end up doing because i want these things sooooooooooo much i forget i have any dignity) and trying to get a better reason for her not going for like an hour and a half, she had to go and then i called caitlin...      i really wish she had more explanation though. because... its like... i know she's not saying no just to be mean and hurt me cause she knows its i want it so badly. but... if all i have "it just doesnt seem right"...then i dont understand well enough why she is saying that... and it makes it hard to deal with. i need....i dont want to say i need a "good enough" reason, because thats too subjective, but... i need... an understanding of her reasoning before i can have a decent answer for "and what makes it worth denying me what i want so badly?" you know? its like...when your eally really really really want something and you arent allowed to have it and you ask why and all you get is "Because." gee, that makes it real easy to just accept, doesnt it? but if maybe there was a good reason you could understand why it was more important that you not get what you want?      or maybe im asking her to tell me why its fair that its so hard to be good friends with her no matter how much effort i put into it? and i dont think anyone can really answer that...  and here we go with the scarring...  i swear, this whole thing this year has like... damaged me. i hope everythings okay in the end.   i dunno...  i did ask caitlin though. and she can go. and i dont doubt that caitlin and i will have fun. we will. ill have a good time. she will too. i know she'll really appreciate it. i probably dont sound sincere but i am. i just... i dont know. i miss emily. and i want that...whatd i call it? "safety"...sure...  but....aside from that disappointment...which i guess i can blame on the reunion thing cause maybe she wouldve changed her mind had that not be an issue... emily and amanda are going to have an awesome summer. And i dont know if she'll promise me, but she sort of has said yes she's gonna do lots of stuff with me this summer and i hope to get her to say so in a more convincing way... but... yeah.   so the constructive thing ive been doing instead of brooding about her not going to arizona (Which...another reason why thats bad...it proves my parents right in their minds because they said she probably wouldnt want to go... althouth the real reasons she doesnt want to vs. why they think she doesnt want to arent the same) is trying to make other plans for the summer/future...try to still keep moving with teh whole taking advantage of summer thing.  so i was trying to come up with as many cool things we could/should do over the summer as i could...my list so far: -Take her to Winfield if she wants to go (i think this would be great fun) -Great America (not just her though...a bunch of people) -Field Museum (preferably just her but...well see) -lots of sleep overs! at least one where we stay up  all  night because i miss those -Woodlawn in the rain, although thats kind of a whilestillinschool kind of thing. but whatever. -lots of truth or dare games -mini golf? -heather suggests goign to the chocolate factory -going to get ice cream! this can be repeated several times -picnic? -JFK health world -the whole...church thing.... -firefly catching -sidewalk chalk drawing -...  i dunno. i need more stuff. suggest some more things.  and i gotta go to bed now. but ill write some later.  since this...no emily in arizona thing... other peopleve been annoying me a lot. one of those things where its like "shut up...i dont want to talk to you...why is it i have all this time with you when the people i  really  want to talk to are so far away?" and i kind of did that with friends too....which... ah, i dunno.   i really wanted to do one of those crazy hug things the day after i talked to her about tucson...just like...a "okay, fine, but please tell me it wont always be like this. please tell me you'll talk to me a lot over the summer and you'll do lots of fun things with me and we'll be great friends." ....but then she wasnt there before school...nor was she there after band cause apparently she missed 1st for whatever reason which i was gonna askher about but forgot. i always forget to ask her about things. never talk to her.  :'( and i didnt see her after schoool. so...not really a good opportunity. and i suppose i had a chance today after school but... i dunno, the mood had passed a little.  i gotta call her tomorrow. havent talked to her on the phone about nothing in a while. not for lack of trying, of course.  but i really should sleep now. so goodnight.
