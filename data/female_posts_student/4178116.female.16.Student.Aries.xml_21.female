I kinda wish summer was over, but I really don't wanna go back to my school. I didn't really wanna go to my school, but I had no choice. I didn't make myself aware of the deadlines for C.A.M.S. so I wasn't allowed the opportunity to apply there. My dad was so mad when he found out. But never the less he cooled down and realized I was going to the high school where he went. Man oh Man let me tell you about this school, it is a good academic school but not very good for socializing and making friends. They make rules and restrictions on just about everything. Most of them don't make since like we can't dye our hair or get braids with other color hair in it. We can only wear a school approved sweater or letterman jacket. I guess they figure you can pay the tuition you can buy a  $40 or 50  jacket. Did they ever think twice about that? No they could care less. I'm all upset now I need to leave and blog some more later.
