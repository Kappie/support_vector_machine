Ben was suffering from major ADD so he kept vandalizing things and being mean to poor little kids. Haha. Then through the middle of the course, Kate decided she didn't want to golf anymore so we left. Yesterday i was bored off my ass until i went to Stefan's and me, him and trent watched Gladiator and got some smoky joe's. It was delicious. Russel Crowe is hott...he glad....iates. Haha! I dunno what i'm doing today but i had a bad dream that made me sad so hopefully that won't come true. Later baby
