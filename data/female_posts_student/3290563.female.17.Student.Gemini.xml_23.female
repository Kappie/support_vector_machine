It always cheers me up a little!  Things have been pretty rough this past week. Brandons off to find himself and I hope he does. I love him and I hope he comes back soon because it's just not the same. I've been writing poems like crazy lately and I think they're okay lol. Ummm yah. I took my English exam today and it was pretty easy. I passed it because he graded it after I turned it in. No school for me tomorrow. I do have to go in late on Monday though and then I'm completely finished! I'm so fucking scared about Algebra lmfao. I didn't turn in a couple last homework assignments and I already have a D in there. So I probably have to take summer school...Which will fucking suck major ass. God I hope I don't have to. I can't wait to get my report card in the mail. I'm so nervous about it. I really don't want to take summer school. That'll ruin everything. My whole summer will be gone.  *sigh* I worry too much. Anyways...here's a poem I wrote for someone:  Immortal Ink  You've written your way into my world. Grown inside my words Penned poems for me Spun stories round me Evoked epics in me Told tales with me Until and in Immortal ink... Your beautiful name.  Ya it's not much but whatever. It'll do I think. This whole Algebra thing has got me freaked out now. Hrmph. Not much else to write. I'll update later though.  I think this is appropriate lol..Only one person will get it...  Stay With Me  Once again yoru eyes make it hard to say goodbye so I'll just keep driving. Where do you wanna go? It doesn't really matter as long as you are here with me. with me with me  Whoa, there's something in the air tonight something that makes me feel alive and I say Whoa, what were the words that you said to me that made me feel so special now  Once again your eyes make it hard to ask you why so I sit here knuckles tight hands against the wheel your head against the glass and you mean so much to me to me to me  Whoa, there's something in the air tonight something that makes me feel alive and I say Whoa, what were the words that you said to me that made me feel so special now  whoa(stay with me) whoa(stay with me) whoa(stay with me) whoa(stay) stay with me Cigarettes and open air, hand in hand I said stay with me cuz every star that I see is brighter than the last so stay with me  Much love
