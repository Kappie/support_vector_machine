Since this is my only means of communication, and since my previous phone which had served me well for over three years had taken a turn for the worse, this was necessary.  I had AT since the beginning, but decided to switch to Verizon since Kate uses this provider, and I talk to Kate the most, this makes sense.  Although I entered the store yesterday with the intention of purchasing the most bare-bones plan available, I was somehow talked into buying (for only $20.00 more)  urlLink this pimptastic phone.     This phone is tiny and weighs several ounces less than my previous phone, so I'll probably be losing it on a weekly basis.  I'll try to be careful.  The alarm function isn't as persistent as the previous phone; I'll have to work with this.  Something about it reminds me of Number 5 from  urlLink "Short Circuit."     Now maybe I'll be able to figure out how to retrieve my messages...
