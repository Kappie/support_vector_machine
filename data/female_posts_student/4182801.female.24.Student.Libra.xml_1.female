So many other things make the record a perfect product: admiring the art on the sleeve, opening and getting the record out, your private little scratches, that make the record yours... In fact I have only one record, Bob Marley, purchased it on a fleemarket, listened to it a few times at my parents house... one day I come home: no player anymore... i don't know where the record is right now...It made me wonder, does the cd have any rituals, which ones??? Most people check out the booklet once, after buying the cd, if there is a booklet of course. but after that, a cd is just a cd, of course, the music on it is of good quality, but... shouldn't it be more than that?I think i should look for 'listening rituals'... do you have any??
