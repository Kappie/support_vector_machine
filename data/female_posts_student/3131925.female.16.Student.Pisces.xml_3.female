I have no idea why but my pants ended up being written all over but turned out "tizzite"-Randi lol so I didn't care. All day I was stressing over stupid shit and realized I didn't even have to after the day was over. I heard that there was gonna be a Dunes party but half of the time we try and go it either never starts or gets broken up in a couple hours. If I would have gone I would have taken Randi, Deanna and Lauren..pretty much whoever wanted to go. Then it was time for softball and cause of my knee I couldn't do crap so I had to just sit there and watch, and of course once I get there Jillian's already there..oh joy. Whole time I was paranoid one of us would say something then we'd just end up fighting but I couldn't cause then I wouldn't be able to play period. Her and Abby started talking and Abby pretty much said I suck so now she's on my shitlist, sad thing is, is she knew I was right there and thought she said it quiet enough yet after she said it I just glared at her until she left..mwhaha. Seriously over the whole bitchy attitute, no wonder I'm such a bitch most of the time, people always manage to piss me off. I left at three and took the bus home, and of course my mom calls like the second I get there and tells me I might be expelled for God knows what..so yeah might now show up on Monday. THEN I came online and started talkin with Marie who tells me the Dunes party is gonna be tight and all this shit so of course the one time we don't go it's gonna kick ass UGH. I keep lookin back on all the times I did go out and party or drink and sadly I remember like a quarter of them if that, if it wasn't for me writing stuff down the next day I doubt I'd remember anything. I'm really trying to be straight edge, no drinking no drugs(doubt drugs will be a problem) but it's really hard, always getting the temptation here and there which sucks major ass. I can't wait till summer, no school, away from parents cause I'm too busy out and about with people, and most of all...JD. Well that's about it, I'm mad tired so I'm off.
