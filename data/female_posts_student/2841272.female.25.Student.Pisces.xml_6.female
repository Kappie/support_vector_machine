Say what you want about Kaufman, scream that Adaptation was the worst movie ever made, but do not say it wasn't creative.  In fact if I had to rank a list I would say, as writers, Kaufman is more creative than Tarantino.  (Note: I'm not saying better, just slightly more creative)  I'm glad to see we're on the same TV page and will return the favor regarding movies.  I think David Fincher is an astoundingly talented director who has yet to make a bad film.  Some have cited his work for being too cold or dark but I think that's a cheap criticism.  Fincher, in tackling dark, murky themes, doesn't talk down to the audience, which is all too rare these days.  The other reason I particularly love his work is no one creates mood like he does.  From the sets to the lighting to the costumes to the camera work I believe anyone who's seen Fincher's previous stuff could pick out his work from a ten second clip.  It's that distinctive.  Yesterday I promised you my highpoint of creativity so here it is-  The O.C.   To illustrate how creative this show is when it first hit the air I wasn't a fan.  I found the troubled bad boy in the rich environment, attracted to the girl next door and getting into fist fights at every opportunity, predictable and trite.  But a funny thing happened, the show began to let its characters grow and found its voice.    The best thing about  The O.C.  is it takes its characters but not itself seriously.  The comic book loving Seth Cohen is a smart dork who pretends he doesn't care to belong but secretly does, expertly played by Adam Brody.  Even after making friends and landing his dream girl Seth still hasn't relinquished his geeky habit of not knowing when to shut up,like at his meeting with Summers dad.  Peter Gallagher and Kelly Rowan as Sandy and Kirsten Cohen, have created one of the most positive, realistic couples on TV.  Yes they have it all, but are constantly juggling to maintain it.  (Extra kudos to Josh Schwartz for making the mom the powerful breadwinner which dad is cool with)  Summer's character began as a one note bitch, but has grown into a refreshing mixture of frankness, self-consciousness and tenderness.  Everyone in the cast, with the exception of Mischa Barton, have brought new dimensions to usually one dimensional soap opera characters.  What makes  The O.C.  so creative in my book is tweaks the genre.  It was suppose to be a  90210  for this generation but with its pop culture references and smart, touching characters its put a new spin on television.  Schwartz and company's scripts are full of some of the funniest lines on television (divinely executed by the way).  We could spend a whole two weeks trying to decide the funniest line.  Names, characters and throw away quotes are dropped in one episode only to return later down the road, making the series work as a whole, best witnessed by the witty reoccurance of The Valley.  The Thanksgiving episode was perhaps one of the funniest examples of situation comedy ever.  Schwartz, the youngest writer/producer to ever run a television series, isn't afraid to change things up if something is not working.  How long was the Kelly/Dylan/Brenda love triangle dragged out?  Seth got together with Anna on New Year's Eve and had broken up and began dating Summer by Valentine's Day.  In no other format of popular culture do I see artists more willing to rewrite the rules than in television.  From  The O.C  to  The Sopranos  to Comedy Central creators aren't merely thinking outside the box, they're rethinking and reconfiguring the box itself.
