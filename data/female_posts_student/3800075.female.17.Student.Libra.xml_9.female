Yesterday was kinda fun. We ended up just messin around with the hoop. Got to see Nathan too. Havent seen him in a coon's age.. i mean long time. So we all just shot around- then this kid tried to steal a pop and leslie tackled his ass like nobodys business! he ended up fallin on her and hurtin her back but the good news- the pop, or soda for those who are stupid, was recovered. It was some funny shit.   Aww yes this riddle plagged me when i was a youngin and since i have nothing to say please riddle me this: (or should i say translate)  Heres to pands pendas ocial hourin harmles smirt hand funlet friends hipreign bejus tand kindan  devils peak of noone.  If you already know-- dont help anyone else. but if you dont, please translate, put your translation in the comment box and if you are correct... well I'll write a whole blog about you... good or bad.  heh this is kind of gay. but i dont have anything else to write about besides my pathetic life grievences. so Until Time Next
