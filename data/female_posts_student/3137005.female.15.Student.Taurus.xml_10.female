'There's a fine line between genius and insanity. I have erased this line.'   Oscar Levant (1906 - 1972)   Startling realisation of the day, I am nothing like my mother!   As you probably already know, well if you have the brains you were born with that is, I am somewhat of well I could say geek....lets stick with geek, they're nice people. Now you would think that a gene like that would run in the family, you know, uncontrollable clumsiness, tendency to babble, and general lack of 'cool' or you know 'normal' qualities, but apparently not, seen as I have recently found that that not only was my mother a netballer and a popular one, but my father was...well one of those really loud sporty people. I am a genetic freak; I am seriously beginning to wonder if I was adopted, if it wasn't for the rough resemblance of my mum, I would be sure of it! Well, I'm the best one anyways, because I have something neither of them (well â€˜cept my mum) had.....BRAINS!!!  Omg! Okay beware my fashion mad inner self is about to emerge! I told off a townie....and it felt so cool....hang on I'll insert the convo and my comment here...I'm so proud of it!!!! I LOVE h2g2!!!!  This is what the townie said (they were dissing moshers, not that I like them either)  im a townie and we are wot we are an the only reson u lot r the way u are wiv us is cos ur all jelous cos were the ones walkin round wiv nice clean desighner fashion clothes on ! and u know that is the truth! jus cos we got respect 4 each other an we dont giv a f** about u lot cos u all wear mingin clothes that are all riped and u dnt change thm 4 days wot u gonna do wen u get older walk round in riped clothes go 2 the club in ripped clothes? and ur gothic boys wear make up ffs wots goin on??  And here is what I said  Okay there are a few opinions that I wish to express in relation to your post. First of all, 'townie' clothes are not fashionable, hence why they do not appear at the London Fashion Week. I have never once seen a model parade down the catwalk with tracksuit bottoms tucked into her socks. I would also like to challenge you to try and get into a club with your 'oh so chic' clothes on. Get a life! You'll regret this when you're older!  Anyway no one has replied...yet, I hope they do I want to annoy them more, i mean Imagine, they actually truly believe that what they wear is 'fashionable' I mean what are they on......wait a minute don't answer that one, I don't want to know.  Ooo another thing, Brand new guy on my fit list! *Fanfare* The incredibly talented and adorably geeky (well in the O.C anyway)......Adam Brody aka Seth Cohen from the O.C   urlLink         All you have to do is click on this gorgeous pic, and you will see his website!     God bless the O.C!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      Okay wait for this because it is worth it!!!!       Shake that thing you dancing queen!   Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! Dani
