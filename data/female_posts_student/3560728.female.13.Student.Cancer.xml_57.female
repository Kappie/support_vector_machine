Sometimes once is one time too many  and poetry can't stop the bleeding and you can't drown out reality with the sounds of the television set...  chorus  you're strung out just watch as reality slips time will pass faster if you just start to breathe (x2)  chorus (p)  So you're stealing the sunlight from me? I'll just lock my doors and my windows srand you in a world of white light hide in my Utopia of Darkness.      timer will pass faster if you just start to breathe.
