According to  urlLink MTV News : " Who knew wearing dresses, fedoras and loads of pink and lime-green on the red carpet could win you the title of world's best-dressed man." Whatever happened to tuxedos and bow-ties? Or Regis' monochromatic shirt-and-tie look? We have really come a long way people... "They're kind of like a uniform, which I've always been into," Andre says in the September issue of Esquire. "To me, that's real style, anything that feels comfortable and expresses your personality and makes you stand a little taller."   You be the judge. Here's Andre in 2002 Grammy Awards, 2004 Grammy Awards and MTV Music Awards respectively.
