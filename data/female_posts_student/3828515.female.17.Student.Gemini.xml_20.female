And we booked a hotel room in Ontario, Canada. Should be interesting.     Last song I listened to:   Ghost Train  complete suite by Eric Whitacre.    Last album I listened to:   Copland - Appalachian Spring .    Last meal I ate:  Bratwurst.    Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .    Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .    Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  U.... of.... I.... Oh.... Yeah....    Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  Looking at ingredients on the back of my shampoo bottle :P.    Last person I talked to:  Erin.    Favorite song today:   Rhapsody In Blue  piano solo by George Gershwin.    Favorite food today:  Grapes.    Most interesting thing I did today:  Played ping pong for hours on end. You'd be surprised... It was actually quite a good workout :P!    Funniest thing that happened today:  I watched a bunch of Homestar Runner cartoons. They were quite humorous... Not that I hadn't seen most of them before :P.
