We had to follow this baseball team (mine was the White Sox) and then do all this mean, median, mode stuff.  Yeah, I know.  that's from sixth grade, blah blah blah.  I get it.  But the point is, it brought my average up to and A.  A freaking A. In MATH.  ALGEBRA II, no less.  And Josh is getting a record deal, and the Becca thing is settled, and school is over in less than a week, and adam is here, and everything is just going right in the world for once.  I am a happy happy happy person... I'm going to bed.  Happy belated Birthday, Will, and happy early birthday Josh.  I love you all.  I love you I love you I love you...Yall are the best friends ever.  AHHHHHH!!!  I'm in SUCH a GREAT mood.  And Abby's birthday is in 2 months and 2 days, so happy birthday to you too.  And yes, of course you're better than I am, in most ways.  I'm much better at talking to guys for you than you are..heehee.  GOOD MOOD.  To quote both Josh and the guy on Billy Jack..."THAT HEATHEN DEVIL WEED, MARAJUANA!"  God, gotta love that movie (as long as Mr. Adams is there to comment.  The only time I would want him in the room.)  I love my life.  Oh happy day!  See yall tomorrow!
