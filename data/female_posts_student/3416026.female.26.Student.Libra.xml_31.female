Now, however, you have to  urlLink think about this !  Everyone likes scary clowns, right?  I have to admit, I kind of zipped through this show.  Then, a couple of hours later I discovered that it's actually a pretty interesting idea.    I also discovered that I far prefer to think about the work when I am a safe distance away from it.  More than 20 years ago, Sherman (just a tender babe at 23 years old) began to photograph herself, disguised as the anonymous, stereotypical female characters played by the B-rate movie starlets of the 1950s and 60s.  Take some of the concepts behind the film stills: stereotype, emotion, disguise, drama and reality.  Then  double their intensity and add everyone's favorite cliched childhood-to-adult fear... and voila!  Scary clown photographs.  I have had mixed feelings about Sherman over the years, but this show was pretty sharp.  Go take a look.  The gallery is street-level, so if it freaks you out to much you can make a break for it. The clowns probably won't follow you.  Metro Pictures 519 W 24th street
