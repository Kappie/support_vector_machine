I apologize for disappearing, but you people need to realize that I don't get to see Andy as much as I like (which would pretty much be at all) and I wanted some alone time.  Alone with Andy time, I mean. Haha!  Amanda and Lloyd totally hooked up on my "deck of love" and so did Andy and I and at least it was a good idea.  Candles are always fun.  Well, I'll write more later ... I'm distracted hardcore.  Ciao mis amores! : )
