Number 3 baby! i'm really excited. i'm kind of bummed that i wasn't invited to the Athletic Banquet this year. it's going right now as i blog. stupid faulkers kind of tricked some of us this year. i mean he puts us on as floaters and then manages to make us to take stats the whole time. well i'm glad i was on jv. we did awesome this year. i'm going to miss Anike. she was the best setter ever. and i'll miss tas. *tear* v-ball is going to suck next year if kailee is going to quit. i have a feeling i won't have many friends on the team by the time tina turns them all against me. she's such a bitch!
