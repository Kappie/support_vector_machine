With no one to try and pick me back up when I fall down My support has left me and I'm bareft of the things I need to help me make it all through Now what can I do, with no cheering crew that you make me feel like I don't suck Woah There was a brightening day  woah there was a brightening day My whole scene has split they don't give a spit About anybody else on earth but themselves  So we'll burn in hell and think that it's swell Just as long as we get our own rooms So we'll burn in hell and think that it's swell just as long as we get our own rooms" - Weezer
