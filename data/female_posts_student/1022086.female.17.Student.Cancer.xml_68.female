Today I was forced to miss all of rehearsal because I had to go into the Chemistry room to get help on that lab that I couldn't figure out how to write up. The plan was to get to school at 7.15 and just to be a little bit late to rehearsal, but unfortunately, I couldn't sleep last night and wound up  waking up  at 7.30, which was not a yay at all.   I rushed to get to school and got the help I needed in 5 rushed minutes before the lab was due, and it worked out pretty decently.   I dreaded seeing Bizarth all day, but nonetheless I needed to talk to her; so, at the beginning of class, I did.  I went up to her and started explaining my situation with the lab (omitting the fact that I overslept), and she asked me whether Smith would let me come in and make up the rehearsal time I was missing!! I just kind of looked at her like, "Wtf, mate? Rehearsal's not for a grade!!!" but restrained my sayings to, "Well, it was a homework assignment, and I couldn't do it and needed the help. It was assigned Friday, and I tried it at home and couldn't figure it out."  She then started lamenting over my general tardiness and related irresponsibility. She was being a real bitch, and at one point, I tried to defend myself by attempting to say that AP Exams were coming up and that I was really trying to juggle everything together-- it's not that I don't  care  about music-- that couldn't be farther from the truth, but I have to prioritize with my grades... She interrupted me, of course, and told me that  I needed to listen to her , at which point every nerve in my visage started trembling in order to refrain from bursting into tears.   Well, it didn't work.   She looked at me, said, "Oh, don't cry," and took me with her to her office (I'm sure the entire choir had fun guessing what on Earth was going on). So, yeah. She kept me in there about 20 minutes and confessed her concern that I was shoving music out of the way to make room for everything else and how much that bothered her.  I got my way as far as being able to skip rehearsal Thursday goes, as I have to take a Chemistry test at 7.30 am... Long story there, but B wasn't a happy camper about it. Anyway, at one point she surprised me by asking, "And what would happen if you failed this test? Or made a C in Chemistry?" I told her that I needed the grades and the scholarships for several if not all of my post-high-school ambitions, and she then proceeded to give me a "you don't always have to be the best, you know," speech. I mean, she made good points in that I won't die if I don't do well, but she still doesn't understand that it's not just Chemistry.   Everything's crashing on top of me, it feels like, and I'm trying to hold it together. Sometimes I just have to make some cuts and draw some lines. It's not that I don't  want to  do music-- heck, if I ever digress, it's very likely because I'm doing something musically related! I'm obsessed with music, and without it I'd long have collapsed, but sometimes one has to do what she has to do-- even if it's not necessarily what she  wants  to do. I would choose music over Chemistry or Calculus on most days, I'm pretty sure. However, I'm not sure that that's how I want to spend my life yet, so I can't just risk everything and toss all that I've been working on out in the wind in hopes that I won't later change my mind.    I tried to convey all this to her, but she interrupted me and said that I needed to listen to her-- this was about the point I burst out crying and wound up in her office.   She essentially concluded by telling me that I stress too much and need to calm down (because you know, I   love  stress *note sarcasm*). She then said to come back from Spring Break fresh and try to make a better effort to be a better musician by her standards, pretty much.  I don't really know what to think. I feel a little bit better about Bizarth, but I still think she's a bitch. I don't really know whether I truly can endure any more choir class with her. She has undeniably been really mean to me (particularly lately), and I don't like mean people, as simple a concept as that is...    Okay, well, it was good to get that out.
