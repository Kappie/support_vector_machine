I would MUCH rather PLAN on being at the hospital rather than being a slave to my pager.  This is the same exact reason why I don't like emergency medicine--it's so unpredictable.  This just goes to show that I'm impatient when it comes to uncertainty. If there's something I don't know, I want to know it  now ...like whether or not I need to work today.   Wow, I had a very productive shopping trip with Mom and Meem (M) yesterday. I can't wait to show B my new dress.  I hope he likes it... I think it's pretty spiffy--it's a pretty different kind of style with the Hamlin being asymmetrical and all. It makes me feel like a flamenco (sp?) dancer. I also love my new dream shoes. I hope they get a little more comfortable the more I walk in them.  They're just fine when I'm walking on soft surfaces, but they kinda hurt when I'm walking on harder surfaces like pavement. They literally are exactly what I was looking for.  Mom says I sound like a horse when I walk because they make a lot of noise. I hope I made a good decision about the red shirt.  I like the style, but I wish that the red was a deeper color and not so "fire engine-y).  I hope I get a chance to go back and find a few more bras. I like shopping in general, of course, but I like shopping for bras the LEAST. I dunno why--maybe it's because I'm self-conscious about my size. Well, the fact that I got a bra that I liked and fit me well for less than $5 was very encouraging.  Julie told me Thursday night that she's going to be moving out on August 1st.  On one hand, I'm surprised, but on the other, I'm not. I'm surprised because she told me a few months ago that she was planning on staying.  I heard from Jenni that she has moved every year since she got to vet school (that makes 3 times) due to roommate conflicts, and her dad told her that he is not going to move her again. I'm not surprised because I think Julie and Jenni have been having some conflicts lately and I have a feeling that she thinks this place is a dump.  Well, I don't feel bad about the last reason because what does she expect the place to be like if she doesn't lift a finger to clean?!?   Living with Jenni has been pretty easy, although both of us aren't home very much and when we are, we're studying.  But it's nice when we do go out for the occasional lunch together or when we stand around talking in the hallway between our rooms.  She's a nice girl, and I don't want to see her getting hurt by moving in with Scott so soon.  She's hesitant too, even though he wants her to move in. It's nice to see that she is trying to think carefully about this decision rather than diving in head-first.  So, I want her to stay her for her sake.  It would also make it easier if she stayed because then I wouldn't have to deal with finding a new place, moving, and possibly letting down the guy who's going to sublease my room for the summer.   Then again, the idea of living by myself is kind of intriguing.  Ever since Meem moved into her cool place in SF, I've thought how fun it would be to live by myself.  I hope this doesn't make me seem anti-social.  It's just that it's hard right now because I can't talk on the phone to B in my own room, there's a few too many animals running around, and I'm doing more than my fair share of cleaning.  I don't think I would get lonely because I could always go over to Tiffany's place to study or go home to Sac.  Well, I'm ready to accept whatever decision Jenni makes about where she wants to stay and to make my plans accordingly. She said that she's leaning more towards moving in with Scott, so it wouldn't be a bad idea to keep my eyes open for housing. Now I wish I hadn't deleted all those housing notices that came in through school e-mail.
