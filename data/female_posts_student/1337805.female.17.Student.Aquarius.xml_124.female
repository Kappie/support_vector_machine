I made a lot of new friends from the one in May, even ..well...hooked up with this guy that I wouldn't mind seeing again, not to mention all the perks of a con: No-talent show, workshops, touch groups, cuddle puddles, all nighters, the dance, hug buttons...  So basically, I have no money for this con. And I ended up working out an agreement with my mom saying I'd work about 15 hours for my mom at $8 an hour, and she would pay for the con. It's $80 US, plus I think I need a passport to get into the US. I've already worked a few hours for my mom, I'm all proud, and super duper excited to go.   Mommy dearest breaks a bombshell over my head last night. "I can't pay for you now, because I have to pay for this, this, this, this, this, this, and this." Basically saying, too bad, you aren't going now! She tried to make it better saying she'd pay for the leadership conference I'm going to in November. Which I don't really want to go to, but I have to.   It pisses me off though. She almost always does this when I want something sooooo bad, that I would kill for it. Whenever there is an event that I want to go to, she leads me on, then makes up all these stupid reasons why I can't go. Then, what hurts the most, is that whenever Greg needs something for cadets, or whenever they feel liek they need something, they buy it. They claim they are broke, but yet they continue to buy candy, and clothes, and other junk for THEM. I'm tired of it.  I'm almost getting the absolute point where I move out, and make them pay child support. Then finally, maybe they would learn to smarten up. In any case, I'm hoping I won't be here at Christmas. And I'm taking all the christmas decorations with me.   Sorry fo the long rant, I'm so incredibly blind with rage.  >:|
