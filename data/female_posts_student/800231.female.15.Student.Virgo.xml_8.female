We were supposed to be finding the calories in them but most of us were too amazed by the tiny peanuty-fireballs to actually do anything useful. By the way, burnt peanut is a hideous smell and it hung around in the science hall all day. Bluggh...  I walked into health today to find my desk halfway broken, the top part was broken at one corner and hanging down onto the seat. Anyway, I pulled it up and started turning it around to see if I could break the entire thing when Helen walked in and burst out laughing. She ran over to Sophal who was standing a few feet away from me but hadn't noticed me. Helen said "Hey Sophal! Look at Angela's desk." Sophal: "I don't wanna look at Angela's desk. I'd rather look at her..." Me: "My what?" S: "Err, hey look your desks broken!" Pfft. After that he went over and broke the entire front off of my desk. Ms. N was pissed to say the least. Hah!  I had an hour and a half of ceramics today. Blah, normally fun but since were closing in on midterms (next week. arrgh!) we don't have any new projects and I just finished the last one on Monday. So I was bored for an hour and a half. On the plus side, I did all my homework for the day. Then I just sat around reading and listening to the insane people that populate my class. Ceramics at my school is a pretty strange course anyway. At the beginning of the term we had to sign contracts that specifically stated that we could not make any thing remotely resembling a bong or a penis. Of course, someone immediately made a bong with penis designs. Oddly enough, Mrs.K dubbed it "a beautiful piece of art."(!) We pretty much gave up after that...
