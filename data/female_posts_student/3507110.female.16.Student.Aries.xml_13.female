There's no one else in this house except for my reflection, which I pass every so often by a mirror or window. It's actually quite lonely but don't tell anybody that. I didn't want anyone here anyway. People are stupid and incompetent and if they would just think every once in a while I wouldn't have such a problem with them. But they don't. And then they complain and they whine and they bitch and that's when I want to turn around and concentrate on their tiny brains until they explode. I hate them. I hate them so much that I want to kill them. I want to see their blood everywhere, on my hands, on my face, on my clothing. I want to bathe in blood and drink blood because for once that blood wouldn't be mine. I'm starting to question my suffering and I'm starting to see that its bullshit. I don't want to bleed myself for comfort anymore. I want to see everyone else hurt, I want to see them cry and them be alone. I want to watch them be in pain because for once I wouldn't be watching myself. There are a lot of people out there who say the same thing but when it comes down to it, they can't because of their humanity, or at least that's what humans call it. They'll only use the knife/pull the trigger when frightened, when backed into a corner, but approach me at all and I'll gash your eyes out, I'll put holes in your stomach, I'll tear into you over and over until you don't even look like a human. You'd lay on the floor, gasping for what air you could suck in, while you bled all over onto my carpet and died on my floor. And I would stand over you stained with the pulsing of your veins and smile. And laugh. And I would say, "Wow, I feel a lot better now." Sometimes I wish someone would attack me, go after me and try to hurt me, just so I would have an excuse to kill them. Because I am bound by chains that hold me back. My mind tells me that I'm smarter than that, I'm clever, I have to wait, be patient. So I lie like a sleeping demon underneath soft bed sheets, just waiting for someone to step on me. Sometimes my eyes get cold and the smell of snow surrounds me and sometimes that little voice in my head will get the better of me and I'll break. I love the winter sky and the stars that reflect on the icey snow. It is my realm, where everything is dead, and the icicles bleed at the sun's touch. I used to be willing to be hurt but now I am willing to hurt, ready to hurt, waiting to hurt. Does this scare you? Do I seem sick because of it? Do you think I'm insane? Or do you pity me? Whatever you feel for me is best kept to yourself because I only end up hurting those who trust me. It's just the way I am, born with knives for hands and razors for fingers. I hurt because I am hurt and nothing will change that. I sometimes wish they would all just leave me to die because it would be easier that way, wouldn't it? My favorite word is Hate and for good reason because I hate so very much. This book doesn't have a happy ending. Everybody dies.
