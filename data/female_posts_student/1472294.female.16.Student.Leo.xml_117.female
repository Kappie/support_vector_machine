Don't get the wrong idea, I very obedient one, ya know.... I will only slag for maths. The other subjects I do it and pass it up at the right time. I so kuai [that means obedient in chinese]. (/^.^)/ *heh, heh, heh...* Anyway, I came home early today . Our school's volleyball team is competing in the finals in Bukit Kombak... Oh! Congratulations to our school's basketball team for winning in the basketball finals. I was like neutral, nothing so proud or happy about.... (-_-)zzz Our school's debating team is next Friday. Hope they win, then maybe our school can be featured in the newspaper. THEN I can show it to all of you. But it is still a IF....
