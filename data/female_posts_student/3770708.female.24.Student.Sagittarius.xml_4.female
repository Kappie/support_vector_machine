When my degree is finished, I'll be able to afford a nice big house on the mainland. A dream house is important, and certainly not attainable here in Hawaii, but what about other things? We have free swimming pools, a fine opera, ballet and symphony, a good birthing center, an art museum, wonderful bronze casting facilities, an active scottish community, and a quick walk across the street to see free movies at Mike's theater. But no hopes for anything better than a condo. Is that so bad? Or would we truly be happier in a nice big house in the country, far away from culture and art, but surrounded by mountains and rivers? What would we do for fun?  It's a tough call. We've been toying with the idea of moving to Scotland, Nova Scotia, or some other place that would offer tradition, language, and culture in lieu of personal luxuries.
