I watched a little marathon of $40 a day on food network and then chris and josh and amanda came and got me and we went to marsh days for about 2 hours. it was lame, but alright i was happy to get out and walk for awhile. i dont know it wasnt too bad.  Tomorrow i have to get up early and pack for my moms. YAY i finally get to go home!! and then we have to clean like crazy for everyone to get here at noon. It should be fun. and then i go home at 6pm... i cant wait to get all unpacked and in my pjs and sit on the computer that actually works for hours on end until i cant keep my eyes open and sleep in my bed and then wake up to my mom and little sister instead of the sound of slurped coffee... i cant frickin wait!!! i decided that tomorrow i am going to do an entry about the past 3 wonderful weeks at my fathers. im going to go indepth on all the fun things that have happened over the long period of time, the good the bad and the ugly. its going to be fun to go back and remember all the fun times... wow i really cant believe that july is coming to a close so fast. it feels like just yesterday it was the last day of school and i was getting ready to go to harry potter with the gang and now its the 24 of july!! holy crap. summers almost over, school registration is coming up on the 10 and 11. nicoles going to have her baby soon!! AHH i cant believe that its already here i cant believe that 8 months ago i was being told that she was pregnant. its going by so fast. im sad. seriously i dont want this summer to end, i dont want to go back to school. for gods sake im going to be a frickin' JUNIOR. thats scary like im going to be having junior prom this year... what?!?! and then the year will fly by and then it will be our summer before SENIOR year and i will go ape because i never want it to end. im going to cry when i graduate, i really dont want it to happen. oh well, its still far away. i have 2 more years to enjoy before i have to grow up and move out and go to college and even though it will be the end of high school i am excited to get out and be with a new group of people. anyways i really look forward to talking about my 3 weeks with my dad tomorrow on here... oh... i tried to write a song today, well not really but sort of. i sang it and all but then when i actually wanted to write it down i forgot the rhythm so i couldnt do it. WAHH oh well... i guess it will come around again sometime. i think its time for me to end this entry... the content of it is getting old and i dont really want to think about it anymore. i cant wait for tomorrow!! YAY!! i'm going home!!! nighty night -gabby
