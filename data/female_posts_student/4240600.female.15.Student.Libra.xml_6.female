And then I went to go to bed and I got to thinking about things and my mood just went downhill. I hate how I always overthink everything...it sucks.      Anyway, I still have a lot of work I have to do for school, but I don't really feel like doing any of it, since I don't care if I'm prepared for class or not anymore.
