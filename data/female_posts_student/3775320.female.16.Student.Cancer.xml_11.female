       
        so anyway, I haven't updated in ages.  I read Lisa's blog where she said something to the effect of "Sharon's vocab is large" and I resent that.  My vocab is miniscule in the wide world.  I read other people's writings and I feel like I only know the bare necessities - then someone says my vocab is large and I feel like such a let down.  OR... well I don't know how to express it.  Or someone says I type fast and I feel bad 'cause I actually type slow, and when I type fast I make loads of mistakes.  Actually I make them when I type slow anyway.  Also if someone says I play the violin well because I  so  don't.
