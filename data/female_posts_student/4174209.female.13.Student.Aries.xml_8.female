There is so much pressure put on us by our peers and " friends " that it is sometimes too hard to say  no . This poem is kinda questioning what is going on in the world and the person talking in the poem hopes that she will be able to keep her head on her shoulders. Here is a quote I like, but I'm not sure who said it:  "If God wanted me to get high, he would've given me wings."  Also I think Carol Weston said this one:  "I don't drink because I want to know when I'm having a good time."        -Sharpie
