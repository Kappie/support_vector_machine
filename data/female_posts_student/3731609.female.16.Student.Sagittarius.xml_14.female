I miss the people I met there--Benito, Jose, Fernando, Diego, the Arturo(s). I feel really depressed. I don't know what to do. I don't feel like doing anything. I want to hang out with my friends, but then again, I'd rather lieon my bed, supine,and cry/sleep.    On another (but not that different) note, I sent Jose an e-mail today. I hope he returns my letter.    Maegan informs me that Andy likes me and, not just that, wants our relationship to go somewhere. How the hell do I handle this situation? I can't as of now. That is why I am running towards the flatlands of rural Illinois in a few days. Maybe I can avoid him until he forgets my name.   God...no wonder I am depressed. I even bother myself sometimes.
