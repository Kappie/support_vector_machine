Aunt Rite just called, informing us about their trip to MD Anderson today to discuss pathology results with Dr. Sawaya.  Apparently...either somebody somewhere made a monumental mistake, or God is using Brandi as His own personal miracle case study next to Christ; the pathology report came back and, to everyone's dismay, states that Brandi's tumor is actually BENIGN.  Dr. Sawaya mentioned before Brandi's 2nd surgery that he felt that the tumor had been growing in her head for 10 years, which would indicate that it was of a lesser malignant grade.  But benign?!  The director of neurosurgery at MD Anderson, the top cancer center in the world, is truly baffled--he said he's never seen anything like this.  Should definitely go down in the books as a rare case indeed.  I would maintain that this is of course God performing a miracle, and that perhaps He may have used that siempre viva lotion from Cuba that I gave to Brandi as a means by which to cure her.  Let me back-track slightly, for those of you who aren't familiar with the lotion story:  my 8th grade Spanish teacher, Denise Blum, was conducting her master's degree research  in the early 90's (she did her dissertation on Cuban education).  Her mother was diagnosed with lung cancer at the time, and her prognosis was grim.   Knowing this, Denni told some of her friends in Cuba about the situation, and they told her to go out and find this plant called siempre viva, make a paste out of it, and mix it together with some essential oils.  After rubbing it on the area that her mother was having radiation,  she went into complete remission.  Lung cancer, in remission.   You can read about this amazing plant, also known as the leaf of life,  urlLink here .  How you can go from a 6-months-to-live prognosis to a completely bengin tumor is beyond me--I can't fathom Methodist hospital making that kind of mistake after Brandi's first surgery.  On the other hand, MD Anderson did remove 90% of the tumor, and had that much of it to send to pathology.  Still, very very bizaare this is.  But not so much odd, as it is...GOD!!!  They are still considering giving Brandi radiation just to make sure, and I find that to be a wise move.  I still plan on going down to see her sometime this week, regardless.  Praise the Lord, man.  Apparently everyone's prayers have been working, and a lifetime of thanks could never be enough.  On another exciting note...the Student Latin American Studies Conference this weekend was fantastic.  More on that later.
