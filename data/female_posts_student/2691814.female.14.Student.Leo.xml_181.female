Franny-you should watch that movie cuz there is this girl named francesca and she reminds me of you but your alittle more crazy. :) Ok well im alittle sad for some reason so i think i'll go turn on the radio or watch Secret Window or something....yes..a Depp movie hehe. oh ya and I watched Signs for the first time....im not too fond of scary movies but this one was just weird. It had some funny parts in it which was good. Ok so francesca-do you recomend any really good cds that i might like....look through the ones we listend to this year so i know what bands your talking about. hmmm, i want to get a Sleeping At Last cd..cuz they were really good at the show and i like they're music...and rooney..they're good, i dont know i just need some ideas or something.  ok have fun everyone its sunday..right? ya, its sunday. i hate sunday.
