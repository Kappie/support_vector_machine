(pt meaning pierre thorsen) jeff meyer said funny things about tracy today, it was interesting hearing some1 who actually went to her school talk about her and tell how she acted and stuff. cuz i dont really know many people that do go to her school. i just know a few girls who uh dont like her much and now jeff. its just different.
