Trying to plan this wedding on a budget after attending the other 8 extravaganzas is a real pain in the ass.   First offenders-- the Rodiers, with their Hamptons weekend. The height of elegance and good times, they had a genius band cap off the night with "Lose Yourself".  Then we had Steinberg's Reception-of-Gluttony with the most amazing array of food, I will ever see, plus a CIGAR ROLLER!   The Jaffe's made us stay in the boonies, but rewarded us with an incredible amount of alcohol, leading up to Mr. Hirsch's fine rendition of "When Doves Cry" followed by the now famous, Pilsbury Dough Boy incident.  Most recently, the Wong's had us escape to the Virgin Islands. The wedding was on a clifftop surrounded by the ocean. Need I say more?  And although I will defend California to Jay at every opportunity, the reality is, there's a lot more Valley than there is paradise. I have my work cut out for me.
