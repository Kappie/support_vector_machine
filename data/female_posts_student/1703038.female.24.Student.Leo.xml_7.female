I think Blogger knows I'm out of writing practice--except for the piles and piles of presentations I write on learning styles--and it didn't want to subject you to the shit I just wrote.  That's nice of Blogger.  Thank it if you drop by.  I'm not guaranteeing that the post won't resurrect itself, though.
