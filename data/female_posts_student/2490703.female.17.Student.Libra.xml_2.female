It would have been pretty awesome, but we had to sit out there for a really long time before we could get in someplace warm and dry. Luckily, that was the last parade that I will ever march in again. I don't mind band, I just wish I played something better...like percussion or guitar. The wierdest thing has been happening lately. Teffticles has been acting wierd around me. He broke up with Justine like a month ago and now he's totally different when he's around me. It's cool because we can actually talk to each other, but I think he's kind of using me. Whatever, I have another person to hang out with now. Anyway, I have to jet, the phone is for me. I'll talk to you later!   Peace and Love,  Melissa
