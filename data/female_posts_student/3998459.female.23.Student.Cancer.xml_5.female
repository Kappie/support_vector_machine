Anyway, I found a really good price for a flight back to Illinois, so I jumped on it, and now I sit, in pre-flight, waiting for the gates to open and allow the flood of really unhappy travelers to surge down  the poorly decorated, tan hall way, and burst through the the cabin door, to be greeted by a southern stewardess named Sandy.  "Hi-ah, waly-cuhm to flaht number tew say-van fowr. Nown stahp sur-vi-ehs to Chic-ah-gow Meed-wahee. Thu cri-oo woooood lahk to thang-k yoo fowr flah-yin Ayee Tu-ee Ayee Ehr-lahns! Nahw, in-joe-y the flaht noahw, ya heer?"  Some how, the thought of putting my life in this women's hands is scary,  somehow comforting, but not reassuring in anyway. Although, the thought of her perky self fly the plane is almost better than a pilot so sleep deprived he can't remember he's flow from Orlando to Las Vegas to Portland and hopped a commuter to Seattle.  I guess I'm just ranting now. But, seriously, we go through like five hours of security checks only to find out the planes are pretty much flying themselves.  Here's an annoying side note: I go into a Starbucks that is conveniently located at the exit of security, and get a Black Tea Lemonade. I ask the guy if they have a T-Mobile Hotspot, and he says no, bummer for me. But, he says, he knows that this corridor has wireless internet! Great, I say, and I thank him. I get my drink, and find a seat by a plug in. I start up my computer and wait for it to boot. It does. But, lo and behold, no Wi-Fi service, at least my computer doesn't think so. So I check it's settings, and MY COMPUTER LIED! There it is: ERAIR. So I click on it, and it asks for a password. Well, suffice to say it's evidentially an internal work wireless, 'cause I CAN'T GET ON IT! Kind of bothered me. So, now I'm typing this in NotePad and saving it so upload later. I'm also not getting any work done, which in all actuality has nothing to do with there being no Wi-Fi and more to do with me being lazy. Wireless internet tends not to help laziness. Therefore, I'm perturbed.  I saw The Terminal with Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones, about a week ago, and if you've seen it you know that on of Tom Hank's character's friends is an Indian Custodial worker. He kind of walks hunkered over and likes to watch people ignore the "Wet Floor" signs. Well, as I'm sitting here a custodial worker for SeaTac walked by pushing the exact same cart, and walking in the exact same hunkered way! If the guy in The Terminal was working at SeaTac and not JFK, and if he was of European decent and not Indian, that would have been him. Fun for me, none for the people who didn't see the movie.  There's a play set and the end of this seating area. You know like the ones that came out in the late 80's/early 90's. They're blue and green, with a red slide, and they look like they're inflatable, but really they are made of hard plastic. They are reminiscent of fantasy cottages. Anyway, it's just sitting there at the end of the alcove that houses a couple of gates, A4 and 5, I think. Kids are crawling all over it, but it seems so out of place. They should be in a backyard, with a tall wooden fence, and have a grass floor, not a carpeted one. I think I may be becoming WAY too picky, but honestly, who puts a other yard accessories in an airport? You don't see garden hoses, and plastic Flamingos, and mailboxes! Not to mention the lack of that tall wooden fence. I think that's fairly definitive. Yes? No? Maybe?  Well, I suppose I should wrap this up, I'm supposed to board in fifteen minutes and my plane doesn't seem to be here. That's cause for concern. Maybe it's on the other side... Maybe it's been delayed... MAYBE I'M AT THE WRONG GATE! That's not good. All this negative thinking has got my all mixed up.  So, one last thought to leave you with. Do you ever feel like, when you're inline to board the plane, and even though you have an assigned seat, and you are guaranteed that seat, it says so on the ticket, that you will get to the front of the line and the lady will go, "I'm sorry, planes full." And then pull the little tube-like gate thingy closed infront of you? I do, and it it keeps me up at nights!  Well, the plane showed up, good for it. I guess I'll write sometime else. I'm good like that.
