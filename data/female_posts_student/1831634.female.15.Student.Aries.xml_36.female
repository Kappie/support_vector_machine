TWO regular classes is already a whole friggin lot less than more ppl are taking, not that I even CARE about what other people are taking because it's MY LIFE.  You went and got a fancy little education at some esteemed college and look at your fucking co-workers: THEY'RE STILL THE SCUM OF THE EARTH.  I'm doing a lot better NOW than a lot of the ppl you see every day did in ALL THEIR FRIGGIN LIFE so I'm not going to starve on the streets when I grow up NO MATTER WHAT.  SO SHUT THE FUCK UP AND LET ME LIVE MY LIFE THE WAY I WANT TO.    DISS ENSEMBLE AND   DIE  .
