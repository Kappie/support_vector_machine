And are there different levels of soul mates; those who are meant to be your friend and those who are meant to be something more? Because I feel a very strong and distinct connection between me and my close friends, but how can you distinguish whether that friend is meant to be something more in your life? I’d be foolish to deny a connection or “force”, but at what cost? Is it worth the pain of a failed friendship? Is it likely a person whom could be your soul mate could be the same person who can make you hurt so badly, and also make you laugh ‘til it hurts? I wonder if it is possible to even understand the depths of any of this, or whether I just need to trust my instincts! Webster’s says soul mate is “one of two persons compatible with each other in disposition, point of view, or sensitivity.” Is that all it takes??? Fuck, I thought it was so much deeper than that…I guess I should lighten up!
