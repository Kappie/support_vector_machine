I don't care who... I just don't want to have any parental unit there...  Skipped 2-6th hours and went to Josh's house. Did homework. Slept. Woke up. My battery is almost dead on my cell. Dammit. ZERO 7! TONIGHT! AHHH!!!   Remember Michelle: "Damn, if Zero 7 was coming into town I think I'd be the most retarded about it." So what happens? Zero 7 comes into town...
