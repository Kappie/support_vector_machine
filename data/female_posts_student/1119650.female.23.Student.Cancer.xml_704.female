Andrew: I just wanted to say thank you for a really awesome six months, its been a lot of fun and aside from finding an awesome boyfriend I've found someone who ended up being one of my very best friends.  Whether snowboarding, trekkin' around Toronto, going to your hockey games, Halo (even if you *do* always win) or just lounging around the house I always seem to have a great time when I'm with you.  You've made it easy for me to just be me, I'd forgotten how easy that was.  So, as I said earlier, thank you for six months of smiles and here is to the next six.    xoxo, Dey
