YAY for Wal-mart!!!! I got a couple of new things... nothing major. We met up with Mel, Norm and Greg there too.... I had the day off today, boy was that nice. I drove Mike to his sister's house, ate lunch at McDonald's and got a happy meal.... I now have 3 different Beanie Baby Bears, but I have four total.... one is a duplicate... hee hee, oh well, I love 'em!! I think I am done writing for tonight... peace!
