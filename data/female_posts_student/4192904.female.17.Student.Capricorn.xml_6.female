But we have only 1 paper for common test- Media in society. So it's 2-weeks break actually!! But then again.. with all those studying and projects... I doubt i can really relax... But hey, it's better than no break!      Hai... Feel so tired and stress and lonely... I have been asking myself if i have done something wrong or made a wrong choice... Yea... Coming to np.. Studying MCM... Meeting new friends.. This is what i want!! Or rather i think i want... But why do i feel so tired? I've no answer to that too... What's wrong with me??? X'O      Maybe i'm like what my other friends say... I'm too sensitive... Yea.. i think i am too... Sometimes i feel like everybody don't like or want me as their friends.. Or i'm so extra or outcast... I know i'm irritating u guys by saying this. But it's easy for you guys to say: No lah, you aren't! or Can you stop saying everybody dislike you? Sometimes i feel like all the bad things can happen to me alot of times. And i really mean "ALOT" of times. Can someone please just come up and tell me that i'm wrong about myself...?       I want to go back to my old self... the cheerful side of me... What has become of me now? This isn't me at all! I can't recongise myself...    I must wake up!! WAKE UP AH BIN!!! Shouldn't put myself in misery.. especially the people around me.. And it's just the start of the break! Sorry guys.. Cheers!!! =]
