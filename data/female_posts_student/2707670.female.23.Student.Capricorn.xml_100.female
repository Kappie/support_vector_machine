I am really tired of my undergrad math class and I have not been going atleast once a week and so when I took my test today I was a little lost but why should I work hard on that when I only have to pass? Why oh Why did I come back to school? Oh yeah, I don't like to work.  This Saturday is the big spring fest for Purdue. I am going to give demonstrations on using GPS and selling carmeled apples. I had never used GPS until yesterday afternoon but no biggie. The biggest wonder for me is how I am going to make it there before 8 in the morning as lent is over and I can drink again so Friday night is going to be a fun night but I don't know how fun Saturday morning is going to be. Well atleast I made it the full time. Thats more than I can say for all the people around me who are still chewing and smoking and eating sweets (which I personally couldn't have given up). I win they loose. Just like when we graduated and we had to go out every night for 20 nights before graduation. Brendan and I won and everyone else lost! I'm really not competitive at all.
