Though, we've found several cars in our price range which is $2,000. Not that much for a car, so I shouldn't expect too much from it. If anyone knows of a car that's not a piece of sh*t that is around $2,000, give me a call. Please? lol Other than that, we went to Wal-Mart(oh joy). I got LOTR: The Return of the King. Haven't had a chance to watch it yet, though. Ah well, I will eventually. And I got this really cute pair of undies!!!! It's got the scorpio symbol on the front with the word "scorpio" embroidered on the front of the left hip, and then on the back it says the characteristics of a scorpio. It lists: perceptive, passionate, resourceful, magnetic, masterful on the butt on em. They're so cute! I just wanna show em off to everyone. But I won't, since someone would kill me for it. Ah well Chelsea's back in town! yippie! Though, she only came back to "pick up some things". Feh, I know she only came to see.....someone. hehe, I didn't say their name, so dont' kill me!
