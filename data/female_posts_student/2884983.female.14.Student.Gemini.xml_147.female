But I am no go at making poems :( bah oh well. I'MA LEADER NOT A FOLLOWER!! BAH HUMBUG oh yayness! drama camp starts tomorrow! yay, lol it is funny cause it isnt even a real camp :) yay. I'm gonna meet Ville. And we are  gonna get married and I am gonna be his bitch. he is really ugly but i can deal with that. He will teach me how to sing and his band will teach me how to play instruments and I will be an instumental playing bitch :) yay. I love Ville. I wish I knew him, him and Ashba, they both kick mega ass. yesh. Oh I got a mosquito bite on my forehead and it hurts because it has turned into a mini goose egg. Fuck I have been getting hurt alot. WHen I went camping I scratched up my legs and when we [krystal, ehran and I] went to the lake I got bruises all up and down both shins. lol then when I went riding today Cory [the horse I rode] decided he had 'light feet' and so he decided to start cantering....in the bushes :/ But it was fun, although My left arm got all bloody :) it was great. I love trail rides. Bah. I hate my knife, because currently I dont have it:( and it makes me sad. Oh well when I go into Cumberland tomorrow I can go to Alesha's and I think I left it there. *fuck fuck fuck I am angry with my skateboard* lol it is funny cause I dont have a skateboard. My brother has three but I'm not allowed to use any of them. Fucktard parents :( Fuck I hate gaia. It isnt working but gawds it is so fucking addictive. I am so glad I dont do any drugs or drink, I'd get so freaking hooked O_O and it would be bad. It would be a very slow form of suicide. HEY! you know what I just realized? My uncle indirectly commited suicide!! Cause he got lung cancer and died from smoking! OMFG! How could I not realize that? bah talk about blind. Oh well. I really have nothing to say other than listen to HIM...or else. :) well ciao my pretties >.
