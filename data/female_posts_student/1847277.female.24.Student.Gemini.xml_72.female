But, I felt the need to look up all the definitions of fierce in the dictionary, and here's what we get:  1  a : violently hostile or aggressive in temperament     b : given to fighting or killing  2  a : marked by unrestrained zeal or vehemence      b : extremely vexatious, disappointing, or intense  3     : furiously active or determined  4     : wild or menacing in appearance  I suppose I was meaning the furiously active or determined thing.  But perhaps people think I'm wild in appearance?  Or given to killing? Hmm...
