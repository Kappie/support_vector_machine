I got by Brother David without him yelling at me for my shirt, so I was relieved, since Haley's covered a lot more than mine did and she still got in trouble. Um.. just danced and stuff lol. Ran around on Jack's crutches while he danced with Kaci. It was fun! Haha, I'd never used crutches before. Yes, I am a dork. :-P  My friends are my heroes. ;-)
