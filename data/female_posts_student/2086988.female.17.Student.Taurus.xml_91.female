I know that alot people are probably asking themselves why God would let 2 horribles tradegies happen so close together. I wish I knew tha answer too. But this one verse always comforts me whenever I'm in doubt or sad over a loss:   There is a time for everything,  and a season for every activity under heaven:  a time to be born and a time to die,  a time to plant and a time to uproot,  a time to kill and a time to heal,  a time to tear down and a time to build,  a time to weep and a time to laugh,  a time to mourn and a time to dance,  a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them,  a time to embrace and a time to refrain,  a time to search and a time to give up,  a time to keep and a time to throw away,  a time to tear and a time to mend,  a time to be silent and a time to speak,  a time to love and a time to hate,  a time for war and a time for peace.  Ecclesiastes 3:1-8  RIP: Tyler Davis 4/24/04
