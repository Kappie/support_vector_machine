The headline is one that automatically gets us intrigued. I think it is meant so as we see Ms Hawkins as a rather animal on show, purely a piece of meat.    Q2) What is Robin Riley’s main contention?  To argue that beauty pageants send a bad message out to the public that you have to be beautiful to be successful. And that beauty pageant are a sexually driven waste of time.   Q3) List the words and phrases that she uses to support her anti-pageant view?  -	“That’s basically all they are, window dressing” -	 Cattle markets -	 Meaningless title and a useless crown -	“It was all about looks” -	 Exploitative -	“Heretical display of exploitation and decadence”  	 Q4) Explain how the words and phrases help her convey her view. What is the tone? What issues does she highlight?  The tone of the article is rather satirical. With comments relating to other peoples opinions being rather sarcastic and the overall put downs towards these people she seems rather argumentative with her view She highlights the past contestants and winners and some of their pathetically ditsy answers to a few of the questions asked. Opposing the view that pageant are not just about looks she laughs at the statement by rival contest Miss World’s in that they promised a contest about beauty with purpose. She is being critical of everything to do with beauty pageants.        Q5) Write a short response to riley supporting pageants.  Dear Ms Riley, 	After recently reading your article entitled “Queen of the cattle market” I am really disappointed with your pessimistic view towards beauty pageants.  Although I do appreciate your personal opinion I found that you actually shot yourself before you began. Stating that some people see it as harmless fun was reasonable. And you effectively argued about that but when you stepped towards freedom of choice you lost it. Freedom of choice is something as Australians that we have and you are right, she was just exercising her right. Although I do agree with you in the term that beauty pageants are pointless there are many people in the world that disagree. Some of these people even dream about winning these “cattle markets” as you like to call them. And who are we, who are you to shut these people’s dreams down. There are many other worse occupations in this world. I find that quite a few other accepted jobs in the community could be easily scoffed at too. Yours for example. You are getting paid to criticise other people in the world, criticise their decisions. Just as Donald Trump has no right to judge a woman’s beauty, I don’t believe you have the right to question their intellectual integrity. So as much as I do respect you opinion I think that laughing at these people’s dreams is not the answer.  	Melanie Barnes
