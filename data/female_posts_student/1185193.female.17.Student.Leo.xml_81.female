Everyone was really sweaty and gross.  When we were leaving, it was so crowded getting out of Buck Shaw Stadium.  Wall to wall people, cranky, hot, tired, and hungry.  That was fun.  But Vaci was so cute in her little gown and hat.  I love her so much that it was worth the good, bad, and in-between.  Congrats to Veronika, member of the class of 2004!  Hooray!  Then we met a bunch of people at La Paloma.  The beans were so divine.  Simply the best.  And I ate some chicken enchilada and had a churro for dessert.  Yummy.  It was  so interesting the range of nationality at our table.  There was Milla, an exchange student from Brazil, Julia, an exchange student from Germany, Stephanie, who spent a year in Costa Rica, and Elvis, who is native of Guyana.  And of course Vaci, Aniko, Andrew, and Aggie are from Hungary.  It was fun hearing their different stories from around the world and what their thoughts of America were.  Highly interesting.  Got home.  Decided to go buy the new  urlLink Nike Shox Bella running shoes  because I am in desperate need of a decent pair.  They are really fun shoes--aesthetically and mechanically.  They have motivated me to take a run later.  I also purchased two  urlLink Original Xertubes .  For lack of better adjectives, they are also fun.  "To-Do" for tomorrow:  Church Clean Room Dance rehersal at AMT  And I'm absolutely going to clean my room because everyday I keep saying, "Oh, I'll do it tomorrow."  Yet each day it has the same unkempt look:  Clothes EVERYWHERE (dirty and clean).  Dust bunnies.  Miscellaneous crap cluttering the joint.  Tomorrow, no more!  You are my accountability, okay?
