ITEM #1: the 'v' button on my keyboard is sticking for some unknown reason. donno why. must find out and fix. ITEM #2: my hands are FREEZING cold. hmmm. ITEM #3: i went to the gym today for the first time in about 3 months. it was pretty fun. but im so outa shape that it was really tiring. ITEM #4: i am going to have to find more interesting items to discuss than this. this is pathetic. i shall go do something constructive [?] like chem homework!!! yay.
