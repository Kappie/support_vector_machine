Please pray for her, the Lauzon and Sgro families.  In other news, I leave tomorrow for the cabin. I am a little stressed with all of the prep it takes, but I'm sure it will all be fine once we get to the lake. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the weather while there's still time, for Fall is upon  us. And we all know what that means for me...  Well, it's time for me to start packing. For those of you I missed saying goodbye to on Wednsday:  GOODBYE!
