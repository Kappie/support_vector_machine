The man lied to me, when I trusted him."  Amen.  The thunderstorm. It makes me think of a past telephone call. Before the awkwardness had set it. "I love thunderstorms." "Yeah, me too." Before I made the mistake. Good times are gone. Maybe that's why I have to leave. So that one day, I can come back. And the good times will be waiting for me again. "I love thunderstorms." But that's not the only thing. What the world needs now...
