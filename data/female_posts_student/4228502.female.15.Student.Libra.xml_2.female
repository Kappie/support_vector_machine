And the worst part is I've only been in school for two days. O.O       How is it possible? I wonder the same thing myself. It seems as though I have been in school forever, as though I never left. Which is good in some ways, you know like I'm comfortable with being there, and I'm okay with the strange people touching me in the hallway. *shifty eyes*      Which reminds me; I walked by this guy in the hall the other day, and I could feel the heat coming off him. Is that strange to you? Cause it was kinda weird to me. But recently I've been very sensitive to the amount of heat people are putting off. When I stand near people its like I can feel their radiation. O.o Scary, I know. But also kinda nifty. (In a creepy, fetish kinda way..hehe)      Oh well.       There are very few people in this world that can understand my incoherent babble. (At least I only know of a few) See Ashley, she gets it, we have one of those creepy connections. You know the kind when you know what the other is gonna say before they say it, or you pick up their feelings without even being near them. Stuff like that. Anywhosit, I wonder what that comes from. Is it just random people that this happens with? Or is it some connection that develops after knowing a person for so long?   I really don't think its that latter of the two because I have known plenty of people longer than I have known Ashley, and I never have, nor do I have now, any connection like that. ...*ponders*       See now you're thinking that I'm insane, that I don't know what I'm talking about, that no one  really  has connections like that. But I do, and that just proves that you don't truly comprehend my incoherent babble. Good for you, you follow the flock. Its safer to do that anyway, you know if you drift..or wander off, you could get devoured by lions or wolves.       Theres a happy thought for you. *sarcasm* Either way you look at it, unless you do understand my rambles, what I just said was an insult to you. Following the flock is by no means a good thing. You're a sheep, you're caught up in life, following the footsteps of someone else, and thinking you're getting ahead, but really you're just the same as everyone else, no different to the eyes of an outsider. And if you arn't following, it means that you're rebelling. That you have no place, and you are probably an outcast, you've done something horrid, or you just have a horrid attitude. I don't really like people with bad attitudes. Because even though it may seem like I am a rather depressing person, I'm not.       In truth, I am one very happy person. I have nothing to be sad about, and nothing to regret. I can move either way on the ladder, up or down. And I'm not afraid to do either. I'm constantly laughing and I hardly ever cry, I have no reason too. No need to express sadness, pain or anger. I hardly ever get truly angry..though the other day I did. The only time I ever feel like crying is when I have physically hurt myself or I'm feeling  very  lonely. But that only happens about once a year, when I have a pity party.       But I have discovered that pity parties get you no where. In the end you come back to where you started and nothing has changed except possibly how you look at it. And in my experience more bad comes from pity parties than good. Because when I ask for pity, I never feel as though the person handing it to me is doing it right. I feel like they're really not sorry at all for me, and think I'm just feeling sorry for myself. Which is true, but considering how often I dish it out to them they could do it just that once for me.      How did I get on the subject of pity and concern again? I thought I was done with that, apparently not, I am clearly subconciously obsessed with it. Ah, can't really do anything about my subconcious now can I? Nope.      So I'm off to bed, and you should all go to sleep too. I don't care what time it is, everyone can always use a good sleep.
