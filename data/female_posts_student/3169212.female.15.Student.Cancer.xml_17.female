Kurama turned to the slightly shorter demon, "You can tell that just by smelling the air?"  "What I lack in sight, I make up for in hearing and smell.  I have to admit, you guys have the oddest combination of smells."  "How do you mean?"  Hiei asked.  "For instance, you smell like blood and death, Kurama, here, smells like plants, Hito, for some reason, smells like fries, and your friends, that happen to be lost about a mile that-a-way," she pointed to the left, "smell clearly of hair gel."  "Yep, that's Baka.  She'd be able to smell the smallest molecule of scent from two miles off," Hito commented.  Baka grinned with pride, and her two tails twitched wildly with amour-propre (Don't ask the translation, just know it's a synonym for pride).  "That's right, besterest buddy."  They then set off in the direction of the others and met up with them.  After they had all had another chorus of laughter at Baka's namesake they set up camp, which was them propped up against trees or sprawled on the ground (By the way, that was only Baka, because she enjoys fighting the darkness, not that she knows she's doing it).  ***  Finally, after a long night of crickets chirping, the sun began filtering through the trees, waking the birds of various natures.  One, singing particularly  beautifully , was very close to where the six where still fast asleep, Baka in a completely different position from two minutes ago.  Everyone was starting to wake up, with the exceptions of Baka and Hito who were becoming increasingly annoyed.  Suddenly an arrow and a blast of red energy pierced the bird, and it exploded with a final croaking noise.  Hito and Baka were on their feet, but obviously only half awake.  The crossbow was in Hito's hands while the spirit bow faded quickly from Baka's.  "I hate birds," they mumbled simultaneously.  They then collasped on the ground completely asleep.  "What strange demons," Kurama commented.  The others agreed heartilly.
