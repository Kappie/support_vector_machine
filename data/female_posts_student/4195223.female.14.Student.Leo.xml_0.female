Sam, she's a whore, Please don't tell me of the many enconters you've had with her anymore, it make my brain cringe. Things are already confusing in my life, please don't add to the 'suckyness' of it all, Just be here for me.                I really do miss you, contrary to popular belief ((even to me)), and I really do wish that you missed me. I'm not a bad person. Why all of a sudden do I not exsist.                                                Thank you for being my past,                                                         Jamie     That is what a letter would look like, If I had the gut to write one.  Ergh, I am depressed far to much to keep on worrying about him. And also, we are/were friends, There really wasn't a 'relationship' there, for that long anyways. But although just a friendship, a very touching, emotional, and trusting friendship. I have secrets about my entire exsistance that only this 'boy' knows, How can I let go to that? I really need help sorting this out...  I'll write later.
