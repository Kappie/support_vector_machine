Ah, she would make me buy her something in order to come.Of course im going to miss being yelled at, but that'll happen at home to so everythings cool.We havent been to a chinese restaurant in a while so my mom promised well go when we get home =) Like a coming home present thing i guess.In my other blog i already wrote what im going to miss but im going to be SO happy when i see Rebecca and my mom.And OF COURSE my baby sis Nicole =D (Nicki) She can almost walk now and i miss her a ton.She likes soft popcorn, which is odd since i just found out.I cant forget about my friends either.I cant wait to see them and hang out with them! For 1 month not seeing them is long for me =D oOo And the water park right beside my house.ITS SO HOT! I cant wait to cool down.Well time to go for me.My times up on the PC. See ya! =)
