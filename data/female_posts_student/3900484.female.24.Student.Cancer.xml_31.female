I got nudged and elbowed and "Oh BunnyHuggered". It was awful. Mayer, the big stupid old guy was like "Oh look at you jump up and...." That was fantastic since tattooboy was in the store by then. And looking at Mayer. I could think of nothing mean-ish to say in reply so I told him he'd better throw his cup away (as in Im not cleaning up after his lazy butt). Yeah, pathetic, I know. But he talked to me again today. So things are looking up. Slightly. I got whole bunches of conversation out of him yesterday. I loved it. I wonder if he noticed the drool leaking out of the corner of my mouth as he walked away. Probably not. Sarah said he smiled at me though. YAY! I wanted to chase after him today and make him stay in the shop and talk to me. I have no balls. I need to be more ballsy. More OOMPH.
