It's been Monday for 5 days now ;). But, she's right here, so I can't really say what else she's getting. Has to do with a joke, and a girl to make fun of, and stuff... I'm kinda creative. Kinda. She'd better have a memory tho. Phantom horses. Er.. I mean... horses trapped in the army! I mean.. yeah haha. You can't know Krisat.
