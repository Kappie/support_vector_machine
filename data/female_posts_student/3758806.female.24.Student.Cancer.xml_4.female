Where do Canadians go for coffee?  Why, Tim Horton's of course.  Maybe it's the sexy uniforms? How about the vastness and vagueness in the eyes of the employee as you repeat your order slowly, and employing monosyllabic wording? How about those snappy commercials that perpetuate Canadian stereotypes like that we all like maple syrup, beer, Hockey and live in igloos…  I think it’s actually a two-fold issue: there is the fact that Tim Horton's sells their coffee at what is considered a good price, nowadays. I went to Starbucks once, and when I heard “that’ll be 5 bucks and your firstborn child please!” I had an "old fart" moment. Don’t get me wrong about cheapness, but if I pay that much for coffee, I want to see the Columbian farmer’s standard of living go right up!   Second, people generally like their coffee with the cream and sugar in it (not me: lactose intolerant... but other than that I'm low maitenance, I swear)! I mean, what ever happened to service in North America? There is something downright inimical about standing in line to get your coffee, waiting in line to pay and then waiting in line to add your own cream and sugar! You look up at the pow-wow around the cream counter and everybody subconsciously thinks: “Darn, we’re stupid!” I think, crap they just paid 5 bucks for this two cents worth of beans! Are you telling me your overhead can’t handle the extra assembly step?   Twenty years from now, we may find out Tim Horton was loading their beans with cocaine, but I like to think we’re just a common sense country.
