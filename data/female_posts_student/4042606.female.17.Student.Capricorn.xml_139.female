Then it started thundering and lightning's. We just didn't care, it is our last day together for a while, and no rain was going to put a damper on our party. She bought me a new CD, while I bought her a CD player.  I am unsure what are relationship is at the moment. We had a very long talk this past week, about our current "situation". I am still not sure where we both stand. Well, that isn't completely true. I know where Spinner stands, yet, I am unsure where I stand. Anyway, we might be spending tonight together. Tomorrow morning she will be getting on a bus and going back to Pennsylvania.
