I had a crush on him when I was little.... riiight.... little...)  You and Me by Tiffany  Gimmie one reason why you look so sad A heart like yours wasn't made for that Gimmie your hand, I'll pull you through Gimmie some time, and I swear to you Every night I'll be so close Every night Hey, don't you know? You and me Were made to be in love Don't let them tear us apart You and me Were made for love Baby, you know, it's a matter of fact I can't stand by when you feel like that Baby, you know, when it comes to love I got time, and that's time enough Every night I'll be so close Every night Hey, don't you know? You and me Were made to be in love Don't let them tear us apart You and me You're all I ever need Look in my eyes and you'll see You and me Were made for love You can lock your door You can live alone You can dim your lights Disconnect the phone You can run, but you will live in a lie. . . You and me (and me) were made to be in love You and me Were made to be in love Don't let them tear us apart You and me You're all I ever need Look in my eyes and you'll see You and me Were made to be in love Don't let them tear us apart You and me You're all I ever need (oh. . .) Look in my eyes and you'll see You and me Were made to be in love (made for love) Don't let them tear us apart You and me. . .
