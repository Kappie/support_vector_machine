We stayed at this super snazzy hotel becasue my dad had a meeting there and they paid for the room. WOW. Talk about a nice place....Luke Willson had just left, on tuesady, i miss one of my all time favorite actors by one day! I was pissed. We went to PF Changs 3 times in 2days. Sad isnt it. We went down to 6th street, hung out, shopped, Austin is weird. ITs one of the coolest places ever, but in little doses. I dunno its weird, I guess thats why i got one of those "Keep Austin Weird" shirts. Its a fun place, but i dont htink i could live there. Good thing my graes arnt good enough to go to UT. lol. Thursaday night i texted #3 a song lyric, just casue i was bored and thinking of him, and i found on that really fit, it was by Incubus. Then he sent me one back (bc hes just that cool) and it was also by Incubus, it was from the song I Miss You. It was a really good one, it kinda struck a nerve, i dunno it was sweet.I hope he likes me. Like i think he might but you never really no. Then on Friday morning we drove the 30 min drive down to San Marcos. For those of you who havnt been to San Marcos, its exactally in the middle of Austin and San Antonio, 30 mins both ways, and one of the most beautiful little towns in this state. There are about 37,000 people, 30,000 of witch are Texas State students. So its a lot of fun. Its perfect, i really really want to go to school there, you have 2 of the biggest cities in texas 30mins away but you live in the tiny little town. Its really nice. Anyway my brother lives there and i was stayin with him and we partied.....and we partied....and we partied. I can easly say that is the leat amount of sleep ive gotten in a looooong time. He had gotten a puppy, a little 9 week old blue heeler. Shes adorable. She had gotten hit by a car on friday morning, but thank God she only hurt her elbo, is wasnt even broken. But she had a little puppy cast just to make sure, it was so cute, and i felt so bad for her. Shes a trooper. On Sat. we tubed the river. The San Marcos river is the most pure river in the world (really it is im not just sayin that). It comes straight from a spring so its cristle clear and really cold. It was really nice tho. Beatiful surrounings, really relaxing, gave me my neededtime to think. Then we left sunday morning, that was a gooood trip. Gabe, Lindsey (his girlfriend, who i just love)and Meha (the puppy)are commingthursday. Lookin forward to that. Should be some more good times.....
