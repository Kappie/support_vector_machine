Yesterday we had a football game against Trinity...and they killed us. But then we went to IHOP, and we were pretty loud. It was funny though. So this morning we had a rehearsal from 9-12...so dumb. I wanted to be sleeping so bad. The crazy trumpet party is tonight...shhh...haha. Well, I'm gonna go. Adios.
