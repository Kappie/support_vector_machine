I love the washing of the feet; it is so touching.  After the service has ended, we process over to the community building illuminated with a myriad of white, warm, flickering candles.  It is so beautiful.   Then, a candlelit path is arranged throughout the grass outside the community building to walk, pray, and meditate.  It is really something to be enjoyed by everyone.  So if you didn't come this year, come next year!  Then I went to the Good Friday liturgy today.   Talk about long and drawn out.  3.5 hours of scripture readings and Harry Soza guitar hymns.  I did, however, enjoy it.  I just think it could be shorter.  Apparently there is a good reason for it being 3 hours because it has something to do with Jesus' suffering/death.  But not 3. 5  hours.   That was overboard.  I like how the cross is passed  overhead from section to section, and seeing all the hands--young, old, black, and white--touching and carrying it.  Tomorrow night is the Easter vigil, which excites me because I will actually be dancing instead of doing the incense.  Then Easter Sunday.  Then probably a nap.  I  am not quite sure what I am doing next week.  I have no school for Easter Break.  I am hoping to go to the beach one day with a  bunch of people.  And I definitely have to do research for my Ethical Dilemmas in Contemporary American Society paper.  Anyhoo, I have to go finish making ribbons for dancing at church.  Â¡Chau!
