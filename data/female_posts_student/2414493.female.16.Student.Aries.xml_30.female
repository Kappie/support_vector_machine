E, J and I made your *birthday pie* tonight. lol, and we did all the wrong things. To keep the filling secret (for I've already revealed that the mysterious object in question is a pie) I'll keep the screwups in the dark for now, but we'll share stories later. Some good conversation with J. It's funny how different people can fill different niches: N is my big brother (and T my big sister), K and A are my smart friends, C and S are just plain hilarious, E is the disgruntled Asian girl with a lot on her mind...and J happens to be my material/emotional desires vent--maybe without severe emotional input on my part, though.  And I think, despite it all, she'll be ok. So maybe I overcalculated her insecurities and her troubles and in trying to help (not that I'm very good at consolation) I've discovered that she's pretty much a normal human being who just tends to freak out sometimes when there's a lot to do--but I do that too, in a quieter sort of way. Sexy German boy and secret loves and all, she'll survive, and I almost want to hit myself for thinking that she was in dire straits because she so wanted someone (or so I read) when she's not that bad. I think we have a little of that in all of us, and it's probably healthy for it's kept my mind from roving to different dimensions. Kept me sane.  I think we made her mother mad, though. Who wouldn't, when you come home to a mixer running on high for ten minutes straight?  I seriously hope MT isn't a reason for Mom and Dad to get on my case again. Well, they already have: it's SAT II classes again on the bargaining table, and I'm not giving in quite yet. It's sick, though. Why can't I like be K, who scores an 800 now and then on practice tests and then hits 1600 on test day? Maybe I'm inflating my nonexistent mental ability, but it's not like I haven't done that before. The scariest thing, though, is actually deciding that you're going to forego the afternoon sessions with Mr. J and then get a test score back that is, according to the parents (isn't everything?), less than satisfactory. For the longest time, I was happy with what I had on the SAT I, but I guess S and T's results make me change my mind. Ninety points. Is it worth Saturday afternoons? How well do I know the material, and how well do I know myself?  I wish I could mishmash words so they meant two things at once: one meaning to get people speculating, the other the truth.   Satisfaction prevails.
