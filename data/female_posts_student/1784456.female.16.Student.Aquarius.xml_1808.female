Have you found the santas hat that we put on the statue thing??  It looked bloomin good when we put it there.  You may also find a sausage hiding in a bush, that was all Jess's fault, her idea not mine, lay the whole blame on her!!! You may also find a reef box, that was on her head to at some point, it luked bloomin gd too!! Ummm had best be off, cant remember a thing about biology or geography, uh oh!!! xx
