And there was that occasional disgusting thing that happens to me almost everyday.  Ferrell ran into me in the hall.  He has to compete at a Regional swimming tournament tomorrow so he had to shave his legs last night.  Ewww!  But he came up to me and asked me to feel his leg.  Even more disgusting.  But besides that I had an okay day.  It was fun when I got to watch Christmas Vacation in spanish class.  Oh I have to get the phone.  It's Ferrell.
