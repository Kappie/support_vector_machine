When I went out to eat with Lisa, Emily, Laura, and Sara the other night, we all talked about how much energy we wanted to have and really make the show great. And we've really been giving it a lot. But something happened last night, and the very beginning just sucked. It was awful, no one was precise in anything they did in Once Upon the Natchez Trace and I just sank inside and my energy just left. It just makes me nervous that its two days before and instead of getting tighter, there's more adlibing and stuttering over lines. Yuck. Tonight has to be the night. Somethign really wow and amazing has to happen and its going to. I refuse to be embarrased by the quality of our show, when its something we can very well control. I was so sick last night though. I had spent all morning in the costume room cleaning up rat poop and trying to get things really organized, but my allegies started getting really bad because I forgot to take my medicine and i was breathing in all that dust. It did feel good to be helping doing something up there. At least I could be a part in accomplishing a little bit. I wasnt in trouble when I got home either, like I thought I would be for asking my dad to drive me up there late the other night since Mom would be gone to Tifton and couldnt take me. He gave me up and down the country that night, but he was really nice when I got home. I'm really glad that worked out, because I wouldnt have been able to take it. But anyways, I took my allegy medicine right before practice and it made me really drowsy JUST LIKE ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO..i was so mad, but I could barely talk or remember what I was doing, so I was miserable and it really sucked because I need all the practice I can get. Tonight is make or break, and I swear to God, I am going to be making because I have put too much into this for it to not be the best thing I have ever done. So there's no choice, everyone just has to come together and make something really amazing out of all this chaos, the end**
