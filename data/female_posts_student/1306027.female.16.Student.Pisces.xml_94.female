It's about....    Meghan's Blog Addiction    Are you scared yet? Well you should be. Why? Cause I said so!  My Blog addiction all started back in March of 2003. It was a boring day, that friday, like, every other day in my world. I was chatting along with an old friend from camp about how the rules for that next summer were going to suck majorly. She, was the one who introduced me to Blogger. What evil would this bring about?? If only you knew...  In the earliest stages of my blogging days, I was lazy. I did not blog very often, sometimes even less than once a month (is your mouth agape yet?). I did not appreciate blogger as I should have. Blogger, is an awesome tool where you can voice you complaints over the WWW without so much as even having to worry about proper grammar or correct spelling. It connects so many and yet so few, with loosely tied blog rings and occastionally a firey post about Bush and how he's out to destroy the world with the aid of the republican war party (Which is a total lie by the way...).   How is it that I, Meghan, got sucked into all the hoopla that is crappy writing published in the blink of an eye? Well, the story goes, I like to write. I suck at writing, but I like to write. Sure, I can occasionally crack out a funny story or two, but generally if you look at my work carefully than you will find these common errors:  1. Overuse of the comma. 2. Cracked Pronoun-Subject referral. 3. 50 or more mis-spelled words. 4. To many (...). 5. Heaps of Slang. 6. Loads upon loads of incorrect idioms. 7. And sometimes, I forget to add words that are crucial to the sentence (gasp!)  Ok, so I'm human right. I don't deny that fact. But really- why do I still write to this thing if I suck at writing?! If your searching yourself for an answer right now, and then come up with one, I dare you to post it in my comments.    Anyways  Yea I am done with my "Deep Thought" for the day. Onward towards the awesomeness!   What exactly is the awesomeness?  Tabitha got a blog! Woohoo! And she mentions my name in the very first entry. Awww.. tabitha I am touched! I love you so much! Hehe. Hip Hip for da Chimmy's!    And then I was like woaaaaaahhhhh... And then I flew out the door.
