And Kathryn got me flowers and it was just really nice.   We started to learn the tango in gym today! It was très exciting. Well, in a way it was kind of creepy because she was telling us to look into our partners eyes and...yeah...just, yeah, it was creepy.  Hmmm, definitely didn't go to marching today. Instead I went out to dinner with my family which was nice. Then, I came home and got ready for the concert REALLY fast, then went and we actually played pretty well considering I thought we'd royally suck. Then I went to TCBY with Bryan, Chris, Nikki, Becky, Kelly, Jim, and Brandon. Fun stuff.   Chris says he's not mad at me but I'm pretty sure he's upset with me about something, or things are just changing. I kind of expected this I guess though. I was just hoping it wouldn't happen. Oh well, I guess I'll just see what happens.  Sleeep time.
