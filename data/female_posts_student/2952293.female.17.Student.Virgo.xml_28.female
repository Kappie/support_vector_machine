The other day in English, somehow we start talking about periods and products that you need for your period. Dr. Doden starts going on, "I have to have my wife write twenty adjectives to describe what she wants. I mean super and little, and these electronic wing things!" We were dying! The other day in History I got a lot of gold stars, but Mr. O'Grady was going on about WWII, "So Truman became president..." and I said, "Five days after Lincoln..." AND I JUST STOPPED. Everybody was looking at me strangely, and Mr. O said, "No, Lincoln was shot five days after Lee surrendered, you're getting the Civil War and WWII confused. That's what old people do!" Then a couple days ago, we were talking about bomber planes and he asked us what the names were. Nobody knew, so Mr. O said, "Fat man..." and I said, "And a little coat?!" MR. O'GRADY SAID, "GREAT MOVIE!" AHH TOMMY BOY RULES! Doc has been crazy as ever. Today, oh Sam. She goes, "So Doc means doctor? But your first name's Doctor also?" NO SAM, HIS NAME IS DANIEL DEWITT HALL, WE CALL HIM DOC CAUSE THAT'S SHORT FOR DR. DANIEL DEWITT HALL! That was embarrassing for her. Today I took candy into school, and at the end of the day I found in my basket my underwire from my bra, I told that story a few entries ago. I laughed really hard, out loud. So much is going on, I must go be productive. Bye bye!
