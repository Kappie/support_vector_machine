So phoned them up very apologetically but they were lovely about it.  So did have morning to myself catchin up on writing letters, reading my flatmate's essay, doing a newsletter for Navs tonight.  Then I met up for lunch with 3 girls who I used to do nursing with.  Its really strange because they were the really cool guys who used to sit at the back and basically be 'dead cool'.  I never thought I would have anything to do with them, never knew what to say to them etc (Mel listen to this!)  but then in the second year this girl Danni came up to me one day and asked if we could go for coffee. I was gobsmacked. Turned out she had gone to church when she was at home and believed in God and stuff, but had just totally gone away from it, thought that God was cross with her because she had done tons of not-so-good stuff, slept with some guys etc.  We had a huge chat about it, then I started meeting up with her reasonably regularly and chatting about things and reading the Bible and praying.  It was amazing the change in her. She was stil the same person, part of the cool gang, but she started respecting herself and her decisions, she no longer did things just because everyone else did.  I started sitting with her in lectures and was amazed by how accepting the 'cool group' were of me. I still didn't believe that they liked me but just put up with me because of Danni.  Then they started inviting me out and stuff, I didn't often go, but if I did they would all get really excited.  One time this girl Bronwyn came up to me and said 'you know we all think you are pretty amazing, cos you stick by your beliefs and you don't just merge with the crowd, and yet you don't condemn or look down on us because we don't believe the same or do things you don't agree with.  And you have helped Danni so much, its amazing.  I don't believe in all that christian stuff, but there is something definitely different about you' - I almost passed out!!!  I could not believe my ears (I still don't believe it by the way - well certianly struggle to believe it)  But that has really stuck with me and I can so vividly remember her saying that.    And whilst these girls aren't really good friends and we don't have a lot in common, I know that they actually care and would be there for me if I asked them.  And when I see Danni now, who is going to church, donig sunday school, is even going on a christian camp this Easter, it just makes me smile and feel lovely.  Maybe God can use me even if I'm a bad, useless person!  Am just trying to do some study now (aahh) and then it is Navs tonight. We have a main meeting about International Mission (wish they would do a trip to Canada!)  Oh its been 11 days since I last spoke to Rachel - thats the longest EVER. Struggling not to give in, call her and say it was all my fault.
