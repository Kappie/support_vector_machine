Partly because I wanted to go again, partly because I had a friend who wanted to go but under no circumstances would go by herself.. eenh. *mutterwhine*  Back on topic. So me, dad, and my friend Amy B. went. We also manage to drag along Boy, which made me happy. We get there, get tickets, go downstairs to wander. Wander wander. I'm the only person there who's been there before, and similarly I'm the only person there who actually will speak their own opinion. -_ NEVER  has an opinion anyway. *siiiigh* Off-track again >_>  First purchase: Azu Manga Daioh the manga #1 @ ADV Booth Cost: $8  It looked cute, I had seen the trailer and a music video that really amused me. I  had  to buy it. And I am SO not disappointed! ^^ Already read the whole thing, I love it to bits. I even got (gasp shock gasp) BOY to read it!! And his quote is: I never thought something so funny could be so disturbing.  Hee hee. I love Boy. He's an awesome beeg bruvver ^_^  Sooo, I'm still trying to get input from Boy or Amy as to where to go next. I finally wander over to the Tokyopop store, other two in tow, because they don't seem to care.. >_  Second purchase: Marmalade Boy #1 @ Tokyopop Booth Cost: Around $9  To be honest, I like this series.. I'm not quite sure why. Unsure as to whether or not I really  needed  to buy this, but.. I wanted to. Yes. Besides, I needed another thing to put in my uber-spiffy giganitc Tokyopop bag!! ^_____^ So, I bought it.  Yeah...  That's what I did. I finally decide Boy MUST see the booth of the people who made Munchkin, so I drag everyone over in that direction..  Boy's only purchase: Munchkin expansion set 'Clerical Errors' Cost: $17  I know Boy enjoyed himself, because he bought something ^0^ Munchkin has gotta be the most HILARIOUS card game ever, I completely love it. And I still need to steal the new cards to read what they do- half of the allure of the game is all the cards, because they are so FUNNY. (+5 Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment.. +2 Boots of Buttkicking.. +3 Spike Codpiece.. XD) So.. yeah. Boy bought something!!!  Soo, it's lunchtime, so we meet dad over at the Penny Arcade booth. Go over to Hortons plaza, get some food (AMY NEEDS TO EAT MORE -_- That's my new mission: get Amy to eat REAL food, and NOT have just a glass of milk for breakfast! no frickin' WONDER she's tired!), come back, buy Amy a new ticket after she loses hers and we failed at our attempt to sneak past the ticket-checkers. Eheh. -_-; Go over, watch anime. AZU MANGA DAIOH IS HILARIOUS. Ohmigosh. OHMIGOSH. I love it. "Chiyo-chan, why are you flying?" "I'm 10 years old!" Dad's cracking up, even BOY is, as is the rest of the crowd. XD "Why the heck? *whap* Why the heck? *whap* Why the heck? *whap* Why the heck? *whap* .............. Why the heck? *whap* Why the heck? *whap* Why the heck? *whap* Why the heck? *whap* Why the heck? *whap* Why the heck? *whap* ........................... Why the heck? *whap* Why the heck? *whap* ..... Why the heck? *whap* Why the heck? *whap* Why the heck? *whap* Why the heck? *whap* ......." Heh. I, must, BUY!!!  Missions were failed, as much fun as I had. They didn't have anymore Princess Mononoke cards, I didn't find the cat-eared beanie I wanted, I didn't find the bunchy socks.. T-T Oh well. Next year!!  'night all! *thunk*
