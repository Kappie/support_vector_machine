Things are kind of the same over here. Oh! last night I was gonna die cause I heard a tapping on the glass. I did the absolutely natural thing and ran like hell. My sister doesn't believe me though.   On second note, this house is starting to get to me. I close my eyes at night and wonder if when I wake up if things will be this bad? Also, I finally updated my fic, Angels and Demons. :-) I'm gonna start my next couple of chapters soon. I have this cool idea for a dieing scene that I am going to post right here, right about now....:  *He stood as soon as the dust cleared. He was hurting all over. But he had to see her. He had toknow she was okay. He braced himself and made his way toher body. She was turned on her side, skin coated in blood. What little skin he cold see was pale and lifeless.He touched her just a bit and lifted her into her arms in one swoop. He turned around and made his way to the city. The sun was setting in the distance.  Lite green eyes opens and stared into his own dark ones. "Hey there lover." She whispered  "Shush, don't say a word, everything gonna be alright."  "It beautiful isn't it?"  "What is?"  "The song, I can hear people singing" He looked down at her. She was smiling. A small beautiful smile.It was the first time he had seen her smile like that. "Mama's coming baby, mama's coming." She whispered before closing her eyes. He held her, for just one minute, before falling and letting himself die.*   Not so good, I know, it happens sometimes XP
