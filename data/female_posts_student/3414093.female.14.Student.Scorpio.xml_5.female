He is dirty and boring, the only reason I ever say anything to him is cause he is hot.  Anyways, Ashley was doing that whole girly scream thing cause she was happy for Geena.  A bunch of 'Oh My God's were exchanged.  And Geena explained what happened, with many 'like's through out her tale.  I saw it happen...I watched from my desk...it was rather anti-climatic.  Teenage relationships are ridiculous.  Speaking of relationshipds, I love James.  I'm going camping with him soon!!! (I had a dream last night...it was me and my mom and stepdad trapped in some wooded area trying to build a shelter) And Jeffrey might be coming up this weekend or next. I miss Jeffrey, and I can't wait to go camping with Bob and James!!!  Okay...should be doing math...  C ya
