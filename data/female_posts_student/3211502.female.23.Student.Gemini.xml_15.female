Sure, I've matured and grown wiser (though, this is up for debate as well), but I'm still fully dependent on my parents. For money, mostly. And, sadly, money is what makes the world go 'round. So, for the most parent, my parents exert ultimate control over my life.   Obviously, there are several pros and cons to this situation. The biggest pro is that I don't have to work or necessarily worry about money. I always know that if I'm running low in cash, I can ask my parents for a refill. However, these cash requests have to be within reason as I learned today and many times previously. But, there are cons too. I have to explain myself fully whenever I make large purchases and whenever I need more money. My parents do give me a lot of leeway, but it's just really frustrating to always have to explain. Especially now.  This feels like such a whiny excuse, but, really, being in medical school and living in New York City really does lead to spending fluctuations. When school is really intense, I won't spend very much money on clothes and luxury goods as I don't have time to go shopping, but I will spend more money on snack foods to keep up my energy level for marathon study sessions. And then, when there are lulls in the workload (like now, with summer), the spending will go up. I have nothing else to do with my time and need to find things to do to pass the time. And, sadly, in New York City, things are expensive.  Sigh.
