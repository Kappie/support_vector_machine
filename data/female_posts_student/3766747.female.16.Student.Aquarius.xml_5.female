Then we headed for Westmall where we went to E-Zone to play Speed Hockey.  I used to be good at it but I don't know what got into me today.  We played 3 games.  2 with the 3 of us - MJ and Dix against me and another with MJ and Dix only.  I managed to win the 2 games I played but the margin was so small!  10 vs 8 and 11 vs 8.  What luck.  When I played with Weiting the other time on her birthday (the day we met 11 of our classmates:  MJ, Wee kiong, Seok Huey, Dymeline, Kia Joon, Anthony, Pei Shi, Yifang, Siew Ming, Chen Ee and Sherlyn all at Westmall.  Weiting was a little jealous and said she would meet her classmates at Orchard.  However, we saw NONE of them!  Haha!) , I got 10 vs 5 and 11 vs 4 when I played with MJ.    Then we went to 7 Eleven and I bought myself a Slurpee.  Afterwhich, we went back to Westmall again where we took pictures with my camera.  About 8 or 9 pictures.  MJ was the camerawoman.  We took one at McDOnald's, one near some plants and the rest in Tom  Stephanie.  DIx suggested it as we could pose with the dolls!  Dix and I just grabbed any doll we liked off the shelf and asked MJ to take a shot.  We were happily posing until Dix noticed a camera in the shop.  We proceeded to another place in the same shop.  After that, we went back to the escalator with the nice background.  Me and Dix went on the "up" escalator while MJ went on the "down" escalator.  The original plan was for her to take the picture when we met in the middle.  But her reaction was too slow that we appeared at the very edge of the picture!  Haha.
