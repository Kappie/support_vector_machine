The reason I don't want people slagging each other using the blog is because that is all that will happen. People will just sit here and diss people. If I let you and Max slag each other off now then you wouldn't be talking probably, ie: your previous post. You'd still be slagging each off. Fair enough if people don't get along but slagging each other off all the time isn't gonna help. I should know, just look at Lisa and I! Do you see where I'm coming from?  I am putting off my history coursework until tomorrow. Its all confused me, i don't feel we have done enough work on it. I mean for our Vietnam one we did like a terms worth of research etc.. So far we've had what, five/four lessons on it? Well. Tsktsk. And Jo, I relaly hope we can sort out that London thingy. I get hyper whenever i think about it! Heehee. And can we move the Imperial war Musuem trip to the next inset day? Ii am away at half term. Thats a point, what is everyone doing at half term? I'm off up to Norfolk to see my Auntie! Her house is so lovely. Actually, hers and Andy's are simelar! OMG, guess what I did thsi morning. I nearly choked to death [no, seriously I relaly nearly did!] on CORNFLAKES!!!!! That is outrageous! A few saturdays ago I nearly choked on a piece of rice while watching you've been framed and the evening before that I managed to get a chunk of chocolate stuck in my throat. I really should chew my food.
