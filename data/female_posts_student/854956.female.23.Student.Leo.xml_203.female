I cleaned in my room, did some laundry, and cleaned the bathroom.  Right now Rob and Kathy are here (they just got here about 45 minutes ago)... and I'm pretty happy all around, considering the events which unfolded yesterday.  :-)  Now I'm gonna go... my brother has some surprise for me stowed away in his car... and the unveiling is about to take place.  :-)  YAY!
