So what you fail all of them, there is someone somewhere who will listen to what you have to say, and you will end up a millonaire.  Or you could take them again, what does it matter?? That said I really need 2 work for history, such a shame!!  Please dont let it slip out that my true love is karl the gay gnome, I love him too much and it may damage his reputation.....I shall be playing human ping pong though it sounds like great fun, not that I ever get that bored, deffo not! Hee hee!  There are small children in my street chanting and blowing a loud hooter, is there like tennis or football on or something? That beckham bloke, really no idea!!!! NOT we are currently winning one nill to FRANCE! Tis amazing!! Best be off second half is just about to start.
