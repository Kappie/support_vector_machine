So anyway, i've been sneaking out for lunch every day and today mrs. malone saw me walk in the side door n she told the office. Well, mr. bentzel said i have a saturday detention but i can't go cuz i'm busy both saturdays we have left, so it's summer detetion for 3 hours! HAHA, hmm wonder if i'll go? I'm not going to west york next year so there is no point. Yay! I will miss 2% of the people there. U know who you are babies. Tomorrow night is prom! It's a half day of school and i have tests to take n shit. Get my hurr did and whatnot. Tonight i got my nails done. THey look pretty. Guess what? My parents said even if we all dont move back to WA, i will be living there next year.That makes me very happy. I'm so excited! But i will miss some of u kids. I cant wait 2 see Brandon. i love you forever and ever and ever and ever good night!
