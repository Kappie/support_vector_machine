Hmm just a piece a weirdness I thought I'd spread...to no one but hey it's what I do. It's what I'm doing right now. Hmm why does all the tv have to be so depressing? Are our lives really that sad? Well mine isn't! (Don't say any thing!) Ohh nooo! I actually have to do the French hw now. :( It's in for Thursday... Hehee. Unless no school tomorrow, but isn't that pushing it a bit too far? Yeah, probably. Have a nice life :)
