I ran nearly to the point of tears and I pushed on.  That 18th mile couldn't force me to quit.  I just saw the finish line just a few miles a head.  Even though the knees were about to give out and my lower back felt as though I broke my tail bone, I ran my way to the finish line.  So in the time of 5:24 I finished my first marathon.  Perhaps the first of many, but definitely an accomplishment for the first quarter of my life.  Maybe I'll have to train for Dublin in October?  We'll see...but for now its recovery time for me.
