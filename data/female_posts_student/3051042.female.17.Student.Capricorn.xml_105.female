How everyone wants to start, but doesn't know how to finish.. so we're stuck now aren't we? I'm stuck and I put myself here. I'm so dumb. This always happens to me because I let it. I'm done with love. Give me a world without feelings. I'm just finished. I don't think I can take anymore.   I thought I made you so happy. I'm sent running away again. I hate when I do this...
