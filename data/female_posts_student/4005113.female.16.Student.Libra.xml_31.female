This is the one from last night....In my dream I was sleeping in my bed when I awoke to a noise. I sat up and saw Dominique, only there were 2 Dominiques. She had an identical twim that she never told us about! With the 2 twins were 2 other people that she brought that I didn't know. I decided to ignore them and went downstairs. When I came back up to my room there were even more people in my room! When I went over to my window I saw the Dominiques standing on my porch outside my window(which i really dont' have) and she was watching Seth and Shane climbing on the wall! The funny part was that I acutally yelled out to them and told them that they were so stupid and are going to get killed and they'd better get back inside. Well, the thing was is that Seth was stuck! lol So Shane went out farther to try to "rescue" Seth. Some way or another, they both eventually got back into my room safely. When I came back in my room from the porch that I don't really have, I saw Morganna. She was sitting in my chair watching tv eating something out of a bowl. Then I decided that we (Erika, me, and Morganna) should go out to eat b/c we need to for their birthday dinners. Well, I guess everyone else wanted to go out to eat too, so everyone came. So we're running down the street (somehow we suddenly transported to downtown lincoln) and everyone ran into the restaurant. We all ate and went back to my house. I decided to go back to sleep and everyone left. When I woke up, Morganna had decorated my room.  There Erika, I post!
