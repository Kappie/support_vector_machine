So today was a pretty interesting day. I mean, not the school part. That was  pretty mediocre, as usual, but the after school part was pretty fun. We got to paint the glass hallway for drama, and that was very cool. It turned out really great. Jess did such a good job with the letters. Mom and Dad are all worried about me because they think I'm becoming too depressed and I won't tell them why. They wouldn't get it. And besdies, I don't feel like talking about this one. If I talk about it, it will only be with one person, no that that's ever going to happen... No comments, thank you. Emma wrote me, she's doing a bit better than she was... Ben has been talking to me online and that makes me happy because I miss him! I'm just ramblng on now, so yeah, I think I'm gonna go. I'll be back...   Maybe Kristin
