If I stay in bed I just toss and turn and interupt my dear husband's sleep - as much of a "Mission Impossible" as that is. (That man could sleep through WW3 and I keep hoping that WW3 wont happen so that he wont get the chance to try.)   Skimming through the news I see that Rumsfeld has declared that there are no military cover-ups. Oh yeah, and we trust him NOW? You think they would have sent someone ELSE over there to check this stuff out, not the guy who had his own little mini cover-up going. Who does the thinking for these people? I wish I knew more people from around the world...I wonder if the people in Europe, Africa, Asia, South America, etc...I wonder if they BELIEVE the US government. We all know the Middle East does not. I can't say that I blame them for their distrust.  After some indepth double team researching in the field of the digital camera I think my husband and I have decided on a Minolta Z2 4.0 Megapixel Camera. It has the auto and manual functions that we need (and my photo class in the fall will require...) and it's not too over the top. At least one side of my family has always owned Minoltas...so I feel good about investing our digital camera budget and then some...into a Z2.  Next week silly unemployed me goes back to work at least for the summer. I will be working at the YMCA here in my hometown...again. And working 6:30ish AM to 12:30ish PM doing something hopefully useful for the summer camp. I also hope that at some point in time I will get to work on their next program guide. Graphic Layout and Design being a one of my passions, and something I also happen to be reasonably good at. Besides, I will have my own awesome digital camera to use to get some great snaps of summer camp and other YMCA events. I will be doing summer camp training next week...whee. Then we will be cleaning up the camp-grounds...organizing puzzles and board games and whatnot. Then *drum roll goes here* summer day camp will begin. There are alot of kids and counselors I am looking forward to seeing from last summer...and a few I am praying either A) do not return or B) stay very far away from me - especially if weilding poison ivy or in are a foul mood.  I like working with older kids mostly. 11 years old and up. I get along with them well, my sense of justice and logic appeals to them. I keep my fingers on the pulse of teen coolness and trends...so I dont seem too much like a completely out of step adult or something. Plus I am a music afficianado, and still to this day there is not much of more import and impact on a teens day to day life than music. All of the teens and preteens will not likely agree on what they categorize as good music, but they define themselves by it, they reflect their music tastes in their self image, and its of definite importance that someone they identify with A) love music, B) have some idea what it is that they listen to, and C) dont seem too stodgy about their musical tastes. More or less thats me. I like rap - the Beastie Boys are great!!!! I like Hip-Hop - if and only if I am dancing. I like punk - just about any time. I like "classics and oldies" and "80's" TONS....all of these things have been making a comeback. Plus, the cool thing is that I was able to share some of my wealth of music knowledge with the kids...explaining to them why the Beatles are resposible for rap (and yes, they knew who the Beatles are) and opening their eyes to the difference between cover songs, song writers, performers, and musicians. I even got to point out that lyrics are just poetry set to rhthym (Score one for the English Literature Department...as I challenged them to find a poem and turn it into a rap.) Hehehe. Not a camp-wide activity...just a fun thing that I thought of. Its not a revolutionary idea...I mean it HAS been thought of before. But no one in the path of these youths had presented it to them. So there I was at the right time in the right place. Woohoo. The more I talk about it the more I look forward to seeing the great and awesome kids from last year, and the more I forget about my poison ivy friend and others that were less than pleasant in the experiences we shared.  Note: Insomnia causes ultimate babbling.  Well...I should try to make an attempt to sleep again I suppose. I feel guilty if I dont at least attempt to go to bed a couple of times....like I am not really TRYING to go to sleep or something.  Dont let the bed bugs bite. --Mack
