They make me feel so...so... oh I don't know, they just give me the creeps. I just had a funny thought. Whenever I say I don't like someone and someone asks why, I'll say cause they're ugly. I'm not really that mean. Just thought it would be funny to say. Not funny? Oh well. But someone post something...  Tammy, how's work and class scheduling going? Robin, tell us about the hot guy with the body at work. Nikol, how are the boys and how was the wedding? Tracybacon, how's work and everything? Maria, oh sweet Maria.  I have this problem with Maria. See, she's not a drinker. She's in Wisconsin, and she's not a drinker. Don't comment Mike. That's just wrong on, like, a hundred and fifty different levels. She's leaving in a month and she's not even trying to build up her tolerance to alcohol. She doesn't understand why we drink to the point where we throw up...but what she doesn't realize is that this is a trial and error type of thing. You're not gonna do 10 shots of anything and expect to be somewhat sober, until you drink 15 shots of anything a couple of times and throw up. It's okay to drink and throw up if you're just trying to find your limit. But she's like 23. She's not getting any younger. We have to do something about this people.  Anyway, Maria, oh sweet Maria, comment allez-vous?  Well, you guys suck right now and you will all suck tomorrow too unless you post something. Nikol and I have been the only ones posting recently.  Rat bastards!!!
