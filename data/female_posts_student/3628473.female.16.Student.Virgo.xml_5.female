He doesn't go away. I mean wow. Even when i have harded my heart and have my pride in the way, he is still reaching out for me. And for a split second, when i forget about my sin. And just look to him. I see the truth. Wow... I showed my brother how to play poker. I'm tired. I want to go to sleep. My friends are going through a hard time. My Best friend doesn't know what is going on. All i know is that i know what he is feeling like. And then a good friend, Kyle, isn't doing to good either...Whats going on?  Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. (1 John 4:1 KJV)- i just read this online and i thought it would be nice to put it on here. God is truly awesome. The prayer ministier i can't wait to start. Who can? I'm scared, seeing how my expectation are high, seeing how i know God will bless it. But what if it isn't my will... What if i shoudln't be doing this? What if it hurts more then blesses? So much to worry about that i shouldn't even be thinking about... Its in Gods hands... Trust in the lord with all you do, and he will totally bless it... Its somewhere in the bible, i dont think it says totally tho...
