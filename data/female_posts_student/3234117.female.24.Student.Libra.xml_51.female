Anyway as most of you know or will now, I don't dress up to go to work.  Most of the times it's jeans, a t-shirt, and flip flops, but sometimes even worse than that it's work out pants and a t-shirt.  So, when I came to work today, I got a lot of stares.  The reason being, I decided to wear a skirt today.    Now I have a complex thanks to those I work with.  This one guy asked me why I chose to wear a skirt today and said I looked really nice.  Why  did I  choose to wear a skirt? All my other clothes were dirty and my "dress clothes" I rarely wear, were clean.  So now I'm all conscious about my dress.  Do I wear a skirt again on Tuesday when I come in or do I go back to my normal "white trash" get-up?
