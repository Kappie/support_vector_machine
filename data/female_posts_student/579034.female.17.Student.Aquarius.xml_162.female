Ah.. so yeah anyway, I had the Strawberry Shortcake Parade or Paradise or whatever. I mean, I was so torn between Birthday Cake Remix and Berry Berry Berry Good, and then Deb convinced me to try something new so I got the Strawberry thing. It was bliss in a cup. After that we kinda just drove up and down Hylan sharing ideas and stroies. I was told a rather funny one but don't worry deb I'll keep it on the LD.. I mean, DL... Low Down, Down Low... same difference. So yeah, Mick want's to talk about the break up... I don't know what there is to say.. part of me wants to take him back, and the other is tellin me that I need to be alone for a while... Why can't everything be like choosing which ice cream flavor I'm gonna get this time. I mean... Why can't every choice be between Birthday Cake Remix, Berry Berry Berry Good, and Strawberry Shortcake Parade or Paradise or whatever? That would be nice. x0x
