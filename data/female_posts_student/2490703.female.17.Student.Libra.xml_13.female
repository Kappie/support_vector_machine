A lot has happened this week. I went Carp Shooting with Andy and Ryan. It was so much fun, no joke. What you do is go out onto the lake when it's dark and shoot at carp with a bow and arrow. OMG, it was so fun. I just held the light to spot the fish because I'm not strong enough to pull the bow back. Anyway, Ryan drove me home and I had been joking with him about not getting my goodnight kiss after Homecoming. So I got my good night kiss. Over the next few days we hung out and stuff and last Tuesday we started going out. He had to leave on vacation Thursday, and he's coming back tomorrow. But in the process of him leaving...Amanda had Bob from Wisconson come over. They were an item kind of. But Amanda likes some other guy and they broke the whole thing off. So I started hanging out with Amanda a lot more so Bob wouldn't have to be so alone, just because I'm a nice person. Anyway, we were tie-dying yesterday, because we're hippies, and we definately had a lot of fun. But I had to go seeing how it's Father's Day and I should spend some time with my dad. Bob calls me later but Kevin keeps calling for Amanda so he has to go. Well...Amanda calls me back and tells me she and Bob were talking and Bob has a little crush on me. It's so cute. Bob and I talked on the phone until 12:30 when he had to go to sleep because he has to get up at 7! But we're supposed to hang out today, which will be pretty cool. He's rad awesome at the guitar which is cool. I LOVE THE GUITAR! But I also love Ryan. I can't get him out of my mind. All this drama. Hahahaha. Well, I gotta jet. I have a shower to take and a room to clean!   Peace and Love, Melissa
