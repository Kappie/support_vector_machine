Which means that there's some underlying conversation that has yet to surface.  I mean sure, it's hard for a good part of us to get over Michael-bashing. Just read the backlogs to the BLog. Hellacious. We tore the shit out of that guy.   I don't really know what to think of the whole thing. Half the time, it's like it was the first night all over again, remember Linds? I sat there cooking chicken, going, "No fucking way!" I still catch myself doing that sometimes.  Speaking of time...I think if we give this some time to ease its way out, it'll be much better.  And if it all comes down on a bad note...fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.  And stuff.  I wonder if I take this fucking stupid 15 minute survey if it'll go away. This thing is really annoying for some reason.  UPDATE: It's not going to go away, and what more, I can't take it since I'm sixteen. I mean, I could. But I don't want to because this stupid advertisement won't go away even if I do, so I'd rather not waste the time. What would improve BLogger is if they took away the assholemachine 15 Minute Survey Thing. RAGH.  UPDATE 2: HOLY HELL. It did go away. I went to another BLog, and it's gone! YAY! I'm impetuous, yes. But it worked so HELL YA BIOTCH.
