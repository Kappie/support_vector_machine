Okay so lemme think of some news.... Well on www.faceparty.com/crisppy i am officially rated a supermodel now! I have been a star for the past like year! So im really really happy although i dont like being a supermodel that much! On Monday i am going to Croydon to get some passport photos done for stupid school, although i have no one to go with, that doesnt bother me though as im only getting the photos done then going home again! It's a bit of a trip but there aint any photo machines around where i live! Then tuesday im enroling and then after that i should be going to the cinema with Nicki to see Hollywood Homicide, that should be good but i do hope that Nicki doesnt talk too much or i may have to beat her with a wooden stick. On wednesday i have a frigging hospital appointment and then Thursday it's back to the dreadding school. ERm thats about it really! Thats my life all written down in one paragraph! :( lol
