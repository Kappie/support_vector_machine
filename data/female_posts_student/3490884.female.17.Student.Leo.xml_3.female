They ruin the fun. Is anger for some reason a stronger emotion? Or is it resentment, hatred, disgust?  I was having a pretty good time and everything was fine, but then it wasn't anymore. The entire evening turned sour and everything that had been so fun disappered in my mind. All I could see was the horrible experience playing out before me.   Once I heard this strange thing about "toxic friends" and it basically defined these people as friends who have a negative influence on your life and often get you into bad situations. I wonder if they can expand that definition.  I'd define "toxic friends" as people who are not your friends, or people who are your friends, but then, many times, don't live up to what it means to be a friend. Naturally, there are times when people cannot live up to this, but when it becomes more frequent than not, I guess then someone becomes a "toxic friend."  I'd also say after tonight I've found one more person to add to this list.   It's possible to move off of this list once a person stops being a "toxic friend," but it of course takes work because the trust has to be rebuilt. A new foundation must be formed for another real relationship to blossom.   Thanks to the fruitful work of one such toxic friend, I don't think I'll trust anyone for a long time. Everything I told him, he threatened to reveal to a lot of people, and among them, to the one person who could never hear it. I mean, it's not like my world is completely different, but we all have our own, unique worlds. I choose to live in mine and that's fine, but to reveal its inner workings to this one person would destroy it. It would cause my world to tarnish, diminish, and then crumble before my eyes.   I don't know any way to live life, but in my world. To take that away from me, would be to take everything. I'd have to find a new world, and that's not fair. For someone who calls himself a friend to threaten to hurt me that much, it's unexpected, it's unthinkable, it's disgusting.   Then, after all was said and done, after all the threats were proved idle, he had nothing to say. I got upset and it ruined my night, and possibly more than that. It ruined my sense of trust in other people.  Because we both had so much to lose, I thought he'd never dare put himself in jeopardy by saying what he threatened to say, but I guess there comes a point where you have nothing to lose, while the other has everything to lose. A true friend, at that point, would drop the information in his mind and act as if he never heard it for fear of it ever looming up again to harm his friend. A toxic friend would not.  Tonight, he did not. Rather, he tried to hurt me, then when it was all over, he didn't really try to apologize. Instead, he tried to say my actions condoned his. He tried instead to claim I can't hold a grudge. Then, at the end of the night, he tried to shake my hand. Shaking someone's hand, in its original use, was a sign of respect and admiration. He throws it around at whim, and to shake my hand after such a display--the thought of it made me ill, so I said goodnight and I held my tongue as best I could, hoping for the night finally to end. He then had to audacity to say that I could "stay mad" as if I were holding a grudge when the disgusting display had just happened. Of course, my original reaction and emotion was anger. In fact, that's all I felt.  Right now, I feel more than anger. I feel distrust. I feel disappointment in him and in myself for having trusted him, and for having allowed him to mar my night of fun.   It's going to take a lot for me to trust again and if we ever hope to be friends again, it's going to take much, much more.   I just literally cannot believe what happened. I don't want to believe it, but I guess I'll just have to come to terms with it. I'll have to understand that some people are "toxic friends," that some relationships only last so long, that trust is always broken, that hearts are always broken, and that love fades, time moves on, people move on, and things are meant to be.
