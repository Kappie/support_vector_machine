SING IT ELTON... ROUND AND ROUND WE GO.  hey remember how i found an envelope full of cash?  well i contacted the guy, and he came to pick it up... but get this, he wasn't at all greatful!! he didn't even realize he had lost it, and his "gratitude" came out in a unenthusiastic "yeah, cool, thanks."  i could be $221 dollars richer right now.  BUT, luckily i got a pet sitting job for the next week that's going to give me $100 to blow on unessecary things. i can't wait.  what goes around comes around i suppose. i can't wait to see waht happens to those ants.   well actually, maybe i got what i deserved for peeing on thier home.  yeah, things are right in the world.     SIXTY SONGS OF PURE HAPPINESS  i had the best time in conroe. i couldn't beleive how smashed i got both nights there. the first night i got a little out of control, but in a giggly way (as far as i've heard).  night two was  powerhour .  powerhour  will kill you. i had the best time during it, and i beleive bryan may be the smartest man to exist for creating that cd of songs to keep you going.   the word  powerhour  must always be bolded, strictly out of respect.  my arms are sore though. i don't know if it's from holding onto danny's boat for dear life (oh the motion sickness), or if it was from holding a brick over my head for about 20 minutes.   probably a little of both.   "AND THAT'S THE WAY IT IS"  saturday worked out just fine. actually, things worked out better than i ever imagined. go hedish for being prepared for once and having everything work out. i covered the first story just fine, even with a few camera problems i think everything was okay. i came home, emailed the pictures to my editor and wrote up a tiny story to go with it. not long at all.  then i was even able to eat lunch before i headed out to the next thing. this story was about a guy named scott larson who died in iraq. he was only 22 years old, and that kinda gets to me sometimes, knowing that he was younger than me.   anyways, the initial dedication wasn't all that special, but i did like meeting all the people in person taht i had interviewd on the phone. (well, i only met a few of them.) but this was the best part... see, when you're doing stuff like this, and your name is hedish, you can't help but get emotionally involved. biggest rule broken,  maybe?  anyways, i spoke a long while with his mother and father. they invited me over to thier house (don't tell my mom) to watch a memorial service that was given in baghdad for scott by his friends in the military.  it was really moving to see, and i was really surprised they were so gracious and kind to me, and nie enough to let me in thier house to watch something so personal. i was the first person besides family who has been allowed to watch it.    i don't know, i just thought it was nice. i got a bit teary, but i don't think that's a bad thing, hoenstly.  do you?
