Fuck money and fuck proving people wrong. I'm going to prove myself wrong. No one else matters except the people involved. I'm so fucking scared.  I've forgotten who I am. And I know I've been saying this for awhile, but I feel so blank and empty. Care not, everyone. Care not. Because it wouldn't be a change from my current situation. You can say you care all you'd like but no one has done ANYTHING to prove that. Two people, Michelle and Tiki. Josh has been a weight on either shoulder, letting me down and pushing me up at the same time. That's the reason I left last night, if you're ever so curious. But everyone seemed to stay sitting, speechless, careless. So I will be alone, and I will not be fine. I'm not okay, so if you want to fix things don't just push me up to let me down.   Hey Josh, painless way to commit suicide? But I'm not a quitter, I'm just... invisible or something.
