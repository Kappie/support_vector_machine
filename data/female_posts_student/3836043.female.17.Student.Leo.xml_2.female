Today was pretty uneventful, hung out with my sister for awhile, and that's about it :p Other than going to Baskin Robbins to say hi to Rhiannon, I didn't get to get any ice cream :( Oh well we have ice cream bars at home if I really want some :p Hmm..... Yesterday was a really good day :) Gene came over around 12:30 and we hung out and played Nintendo games :p It was lots of fun :) My Mom got to embarrass me :p I think her pain pills made her even more crazy :p After Gene left I talked to my Mom and watched t.v. Then he messaged me and asked if I could go swimming with him and Jesse and my Mom actually said yes :D Yay! It was lots of fun :) Gene and I got to kiss and make out :) and play around in the water. I really enjoyed it :) Then Jesse drove me home and I ate dinner, baked potatoes, chicken and corn on the cob :p It was pretty good :) After dinner I took a really hot and long bath :)  It felt really good to relax :) Then I watched t.v. till around 11 and then went to bed. That was pretty much it :)
