My dad and brother and I went to Fry's Electronics in Downer's Grove at around 2:30, looked around for a while, went to Tiger Direct to return something, and got back at about 6:00 PM, so we had some dinner right afterwards. Anyways, that Fry's place is absolutely enormous! It was practically a supersize Best Buy with a caf√© in the middle (and more stuff!). I had a smoothie while I was there, as a matter of fact. It was good :). So... That was basically my whole day.     Last song I listened to:   Mississippi Kid  by Lynyrd Skynyrd.    Last album I listened to:   Pronounced Leh-nerd Skin-nerd .    Last meal I ate:  Barbecued pork, rice, and green beans.    Last movie I watched:   GoldenEye .    Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .    Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  Don't know.    Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I do not know.    Last person I talked to:  Matt.    Favorite song today:   Things Goin' On  by Lynyrd Skynyrd.    Favorite food today:  Tangerine sour Altoids.    Most interesting thing I did today:  I went to the new Fry's Electronics in Downer's Grove. Oh, and I watched GoldenEye and played poker.    Funniest thing that happened today:  I have no recollection as to if anything humorous took place today :P.
