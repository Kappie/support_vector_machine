If so, I'll be having a jolly good time painting stuff for prom, with a lot of people I don't care to see, and some people who are really fun to be around.  I was going to go work out this morning, extinguishing that possibility, but if I go there, I could only work out for like an hour, which leaves me less than 15 minutes of actual weight lifting once 30 minutes on the treadmill and 15 on the bicycles are subtracted.  So I'm really undecided right now as to what to do.  My gut tells me that I don't have to be around them a lot, that I can hang out with the fun people and paint, which I love, and help out prom committee (they're short on people for this).  My brain, obviously waking up from a two and a half month hiatus when writing is concerned (which isn't good cause I have to do my rough draft, and I can't do it while my brain's groggy!), says that I'll see those people, have to spend a lot more time than I have to with them, and hear the first of a never-ending wave of , "Hey, that was so touching, that apology.  *Sob*," or "God it took you long enough to figure that one out," or "You know, initials aren't really a great coverup when his are A.I.," or a long list of quotes I'll be hearing from now till graduation.  I think I'd go into shock if I didn't get a huge amount of backlash Monday.  That reminds me of a  Grease  song that really fits this situation, "What will they say Monday at school?"  In my opinion, John Travolta's singing voice isn't that strong, but back to the subject of trying to get over myself. Actually, I've procrastinated long enough, and had a pity party that I now have to clean up for, and I just need to, as Mallory told me yesterday, "Move on, and don't make a big deal out of this, cause it's not like he's hurt or anything by it."  It may shock you, but I would feel horrible if I made someone cry or feel like crap because of this, cause I definitely know what it's like to feel that way because of someone's comments.  Well, I would definitely feel terrible if anyone besides Alex got upset...like Cory, which made me feel like some kind of monster...but despite all the comments, and all that, I might feel a small bit of remorse if he did feel bad. Ok, what happened to not discussing it any further?  Well I want to discuss it further, so I'll not bore the non TD people with meaningless names and drama.  Later.
