I felt soo sick but I couldn't tell anyone because last night I watched Miss Congeniailty on NBC (or was it CBS?)  till 11 last night so my mom siad if I complained at all she wouldn't take me to the mall.  I almost fainted when I was cleaning. But it happens a lot so it wasn't as scary as the first time.  My vision gets all black then I just like colapse. Not fun.   Right when I was done cleaning my mom took me to the mall and I got 2 jackets! YIPEEE! They are sooo awesome!  I got 'em at nordstrom. One is a velvet blazer (It looks kinda like yours Heather, is it ok? :) )  it loks almost exactly like the cool one I almost bought from Delias btu its cheaper. Then I got this puffy white coat tthat  makes me look like a MARSHMALLOW! Its soo stinkin' cool.  I was all like "WHOA!! I look huge!!" And my mom thinks I am anorecix because I didn't eat lunch or breakfast today because I didn't ahve any time and she was like "NOTHING YOU WEAR WILL MAKE YOU LOOK HUGE!!" so I was like ....whoa...ok... :)  Then we got my sister some clothes for christmas at Buckle and Aeropostale. They are super cool! I want them for myself!   Then we went to my guitar lesson. I saw this cool girl named Jenifer there, she is taking voice.  Guitar is rreally fun. I LOVE it!!! :D   Well, I guess thats all!   BYE!  Laura
