They're all going to JQ's bday thing at FMP so I hope they have fun. I trust Nima to not flirt anymore 'cos we talked about it and stuff. I just hope CANDACE doesn't flirt with him. She flirts too much with every guy. Like Erica said, I'd flirt with Roger just to show Candace how it feels, but he's like a brother to me so flirting with your brother just isn't right. Plus, I've got Nima. I don't think Nima will be too comfortable with that. Erica won't flirt with him 'cos he's... a girl! Ewww~ Hee heezZ~! So yeah... If Candace tries to pull anything today, I'm sooo gonna bitch at her! >:(  Ooohh, and I talked to Marcos Ho this morning at Chinese school. I called him for the first time! Haha! Godfrey gave me his number. I asked him what school he went to in kindergarten and he asked me the same question and we kept arguing about who will say it first and stuff... so anyway... it turned out that he was actually the Marcos Ho that I knew from kindergarten. Coolness, eh? Muahahahahaha-ness! I asked him to come to church tomorrow morning but he had to go to his own church so he's going to come to church next Sunday and this coming Friday for Bethel, so I'll be meeting this guy again for the first time in 8 years! Coolness, eh? Haha! It's sooo cool! My mom reckons she knows his mom. Blahness... so yeah...  I gotta finish talking to Moca and this blog and I'm gonna wash my hair and then go to Moca's! ^^"  Miss you, love you~ (you know who you are) My alien~ *mwahzZ* My fav rocker~ Best guitarist in the world~ Best boyfriend~
