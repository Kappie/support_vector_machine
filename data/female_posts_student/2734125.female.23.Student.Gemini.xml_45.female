I don't have anything solid to think about, and its not that my brain is spinning, so much as sitting in a mass and bubbling occationally.  There is a tiny fly in this room.  Its been here for days.  It bothers me.  I keep asking it to be caught by the spiders that live here, but it is too clever for that, and I cant quit bring myself to smash it mercilessly.  At least it doesn't make noise.  I was somewhere far away in my dreams last night.  I woke up feeling very rested.  For a while, a few months ago, I lost my dreams.  They wouldn't surface when I tried to call them up.  They fled as I tried to watch them.  A tool of self knowledge that I had come to rely on floated away for a bit.  Last night in class we were talking about discourse theory, about ideology and the way it works, the subtle ways of hegemony.  Talking about reality, or the lack there of, always makes me buzz.  Its like I am standing on the edge of a massive drop off, and there is, at this point, no firm knowledge of gravity, so there is a very real possibility that I would be able to move in directions other then down if I was willing to lean out.  I am always leaning there, but haven't found the set of words that allow me to go over.  My toes quiver on the edge of this precipice, wanting to stop holding on.  I plan to do more research, to check and see if I step out there are other thoughts there, solid ideas that I would step on.  I want to reach the edge of theory, and move further.  It is my strange and erratic dream that comes in classrooms while people talk about abstract ideas and fanciful yearnings.  That is my secret yearning, not so secret if you know how to ask.  I want to find the space where reality dissolves, and move into it.  Its a matter of finding the right words, the right tools, the right forgetting.  In the mean time I am sitting in the office, papers snowfall chaotic on the floor, and boxes of books waiting for their turn on the shelf.  Maybe I will forgo work a little longer, breath and think, read a little of what is not on my list.  Play, just a bit longer, and maybe after this afternoon I will be ready to read and think and write about research and all of that.  In the mean time, there is a streak of light across my foot that highlights the freckle that sits on my left arch.
