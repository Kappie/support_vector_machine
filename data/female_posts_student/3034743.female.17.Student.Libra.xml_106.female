To make a long boring story short, Anna and I decided to go see the Notebook and Stepford Wives. The Notebook was good. It made us cry. After that movie was over, we had about 15 min to spare, so we decided to go to Burgerville to get some food because we were hungry. We really didn't have time to eat, so we decided to sneak the food in when we watched Stepford Wives. It was a little weird eating in the movie theater like that, but it was fun. Stepford Wives was an ok movie. I had thought it would have been better, but oh well. Then after the movies we went back to Anna's apartment and I spent the night. So that was my exciting 4th of July celebration. Today Amanda came over for a bit and we hung out. I might do something with Alex later, but at this time I'm not too sure. I haven't talked to Marty since Friday because he is on vacation, and I didn't expect to miss him as much as I do. I'm used to talking to him everyday, and I don't like not being able to. Oh well, I'll manage. Hmmm...well I think I'll be going now, because I don't feel like being on the computer.
