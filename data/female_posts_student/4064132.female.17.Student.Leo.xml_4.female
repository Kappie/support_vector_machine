I had a good time playing with the Pit Bulls...I had a good cry with the ex boyfriend...I had a bitch session with a friend. It was an average ordinary day. A.. you got me good and pissed you know I love you man but don't come to be saying you fucked up and then tell me you are just going to go fuck it up more...cuz if you cared you wouldn't do it. I would help you in anyway possible to get you on your feet and back on track. You know that. I wouldn't let you go down hill. And K...you made my day complete...I love you...you are so sweet yet you can kill me sometimes...and you know it. PHAT AND DAZY YOU ROCK MY WORLD YOU ARE THE BEST DOGS...ok sorry. Just a good day.
