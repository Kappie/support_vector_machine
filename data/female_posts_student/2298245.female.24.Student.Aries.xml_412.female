In other words, before the semester started, it seemed nice that it would be over before I knew it.  Now that exams are looming on the horizon, only two weeks away, and I am behind and have lots to get done, I'm wishing that I'd had more time, or had at least applied the time I did have better.  Of course, when the two weeks are over, I'll be back to being glad it was short and sweet.  Or maybe short, but a little on the bitter side.  All of this is to say that if it seems as if I've disappeared over the past couple of weeks, it'll just be like all the other times when I've been too busy for words.  It will not signal my demise, or my fall from grace in the blogging world.  I'll try not to disappear completely, but just in case I do, I shall return.  Never fear.
