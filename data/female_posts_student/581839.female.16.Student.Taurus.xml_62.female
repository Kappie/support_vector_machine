I don't know because my dads temper thing is going on, and he's in a really bad mood, where his face gets all red and blotchy and he yells at people a lot and he doesn't ever hear what your saying. for example, when i gave him this whole humorous speech about something today and i say, "see?" he goes, "what?" and it just made the whole thing lose its glam and funness and i was just like, forget it. Anyway, i had track at school today. oowwww.... my legs are soooo sore. Now, if i can just keep this kind of thing up, and maybe do some dance/ballet in my room, i'll be seeing improvments in  weeks. i go up to visit mary on Friday, and i'm really excited. i finally get to meet all of her friends. I've always wanted to meet them. Dates to remember: Thursday, April 4: GRAMMAR QUIZ (do not fail this one) Monday, April 8, perform SPEECH! and some other stuff that i have to memorize, including stuff from to kill a mockingbird and vocabulary. I don't think that theres much more to talk about. Margarets taking a shower. Mom's putting the kids to bed. Yipee... i got a computer. i think i already told you that, but oh well. Adios amigos (even though i don't take spanish...)
