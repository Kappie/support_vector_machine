I can't seem to find an exhaustive, yet mildly readable, explanation of how HCI-related ideas, and their respective fields, fit together. I've also searched for a history of usability, only to be told by various  urlLink Google Group Users  that such a volume does not exist.  Cliff   Notes, apparently, doesn't do usability.    If I could find a history, or even survey, of usability, would it be a quick read or a tome? I also checked MIT's Open Course Ware page, where I found some courses that touched upon HCI, but no course entirely geared towards the subject available for public consumption.     There's always the  urlLink ACM library , though it intimidates me, someone who is merely on the periphery of computing (forgive the pun).    It's funny that ACM (still) uses the acronym CHI, in contrast with HCI. Isn't putting the computer first the problem, now that computer time is cheaper than people time?    NB:  I've been compiling a makeshift  urlLink HCI page , with an anthropological focus, on my site.
