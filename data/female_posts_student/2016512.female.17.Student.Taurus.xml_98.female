They brought cake, flowers, and cards. it was fun having cake for breakfast. later me and maurie went to Gah-Funk to do a little shopping.   i tried to return my Game Cube, but they would have ripped me off royally so that was a no go. i was bummed because i had also found out i have a total of -$7.26 in my checking account. :(- x2 so shopping actually turned into window shopping depression. my mom later came and forced me and maurie around the city because she was the one with the cash. she's not one for casual looking. more like "have you found something? why are we still here? put it down!" kind of thing. she also walks faster than me...and you say i'm fast. i did get quite a lot of things but sadly no top for my cool new confirmation skirt. but i found cool blue pants, sweats, dance shorts, sandles, and my "safari shirt."  i also went church *and the angels rejoice* and then i went to maurie's house to shoot the lost scenes of my spanish video. we struggled a little with the on/off button for recording. oh well it's fixed. i'm pretty sure maurie should be sick of me by now. we're together a lot. i don't know if it's because we're close friends or because i'm just a dork who can't be alone. i'd go with #2. sorry maurie ;)  and finally the night ended with chicken strip baskets and the Shack as well as a great performance of "naked ladies" if i do say so myself. me and Ashim rock at that game. we got on the high scores and everything. #3!! score. and so ends my birthday phenomena...  Seventeen: not quite legal, -Betso
