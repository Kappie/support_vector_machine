And not just  any  particular artist's voice, but one of your all-time, all-lives favorites; one of which you hear every day, but there's just something about  this  one voice,  this day that you just can't get over?  And because you've heard this voice and six of her songs twice, everything else sounds infinitely better and the songs your computer juke-box plays are divinely selected and ordered.  Then the edges of your vision get blurry and ethereal, like a dream sequence in a soap opera, and nothing seems impossible, except sitting still and being calm.  Even Civil Procedure is interesting!!  Well, okay, it's not, but the 20 pages of reading you didn't get done last night doesn't seem quite as insurmountable.  Maybe all of this has something to do with the handstands you did last night.  Party!  Let's do some right now!  At the chalkboard!
