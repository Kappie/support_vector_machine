Well, IRB is the Institutional Review Board, the people in charged of making sure you are not going to harm amyone while carrying on your research. I have been working along my mentor(s) for the last few weeks getting this IRB package put together and I think I finally got it to a point to where it looks good enough for them (IRB) to eat.  So, now comes the fun part. Well almost. I still need to get through the lit review and then I get to start doing interviews. I'm really excited about that. I'm not exactly sure how it all will pan out, but I'm sure it will be an amazing experience anyway.
