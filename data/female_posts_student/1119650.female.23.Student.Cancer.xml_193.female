Soon the egg halflife will kick in and said egg will start to launch a fetid olfactory assault on my house.  Great, now I can't have guests for WEEKS!  Fucking cat!  Wheelchair guy at my office probably smells comprable to what this egg will smell like and is oblivious to it.    I might be forced to start running to lose weight...ick!  My paxil is starting to make me not sleep at night, but I'm not allowed to take my ambien anymore because they don't play well together.  I owe $7,000 to various creditors, not including my car and I'll probably never be able to dig out from under it.
