Its shell has been painted bright orange with a little happy mexican guy in the middle, so i call it el Matador, aka the bullfighter. el Matador lives in a small glass tank with sand and small blue rocks on the bottom. everyday, i dunk el Matador in a cup of water for his bath and pick out his tiny green poop from his tank. crabs are cool like that. their poop comes out the same color as their food, no matter what you feed it. i'd choose a crab for a pet any day; they're low-maintenance, odorless, and eat veggies, nuts, tree bark, even eggshells...now how economical is that. the only thing i have to buy is a new shell every year cuz they grow outta their old ones. What's really genius about it is that I gave one to my friend too for her birthday. not only does she have to take care of it wherever she goes out of pure obligation, i have her birthday presents covered for the next 10-15 years: funky crab shells. yep, and she was worried she'd be getting christina aguilera cd's. hehehe...  Business: it's been a crazy week at work, and i love it. i like feeling like i'm part of something important, contributing to the greater scheme of things and such. sometimes, i almost wish that i'd gotten this job a little later on in life so i'd truly appreciate it. it's got the structure/bureaucracy/politics of a large organization but the personal feel of a small office. i get to meet tons of ppl of all industries. we help ppl to get their businesses off the ground on the international front. it's just too bad i haven't made my million yet before this job. in class the other night, we were talking about negotiating raises and this lady asked me how much i was getting paid. i told her and she screamed "WHY ARE YOU WORKING THERE??!" i dunno. my business card looks real cool though.  Sports: i read somewhere that working out can actually become an addiction. based on personal experience, i didn't believe it until i watched a documentary on female body builders. 'twas no pretty sight. i actually felt physically nauseous. so i examined my own workout routine, and despite the fact that i get a little stressed when i can't fit some physical activity into the day, i'm nowhere near those he-women. i should learn by now to not overshoot. this week, i've been setting my three alarms for 5:55/6/6:05am so that i can go jogging in the park, shower, eat breakfast, read the newspaper, and commute to work. instead, i waste thirty minutes grappling with three kinds of snooze buttons in a state of semi-consciousness. i think i've actually been getting out of bed later than before just cuz i feel so burgled of precious sleep time.  Calendar: mmmm...me like garlic hummus. i watched a beeeauyooootiful movie tonight, Chicago, for the second time. i wanna watch it over every time i hear the commercial on the radio with renee zellweger singing the beginning to Nowadays..."grand, isn't it...great, isn't it...swell, isn't it....you can like the life you're livin', you can live the life you like...and that's good, isn't it? grand, isn't it?swell..." da da daaaaaaa. man, that movie makes me wanna sing and dance. so i've been working on "fast food nation" and "bias," two pretty good reads so far. the only problem is, now i feel like i have to shun the entire fast food industry, and i will never be able to look at dan peter or tom as the familiarly benign news broadcasters again. sometimes, ignorance is kinda liberating.  California: so now i really do believe that the 5 is ALWAYS congested. even an hour ago traffic was at a crawl. and that was almost 11 pm! way past my bedtime, due to a little incident with my car alarm in which i couldn't get the doors to unlock, called AAA, as soon as they pulled into the parking lot, guess what, the doors unlocked. in my embarassed flustered state, i didn't even think of tipping them for making the drive out. now i'm blacklisted with AAA. and all i could think about on my way back was writing about the whole thing on my blogger so i won't forget next time.  Health: hurray, my warts are disappearing! I think the free Warts-No-More samples i got from the last trade show really work. who said my job doesn't come with perks.  Ads: Payless is great. i bought four pairs of shoes, and it cost less than forty bucks. ever since star jones from the view became spokesperson, i no longer feel ashamed to be seen in there. no joke. none of my old shoes fit anymore. i don't know how to explain it, but i think my feet shrunk. in high school, i used to be a 7 1/2. now, i'm a size 6. what's happening?? a chilly reminder of stephen king's Thinner. i think the freaky indian guy in that movie with the big ugly mole actually plays the windex-obsessed father in my big fat greek wedding. anyway, so i was picking out my shoes, and there was this chinese lady also in her 20s who kept going for the same styles. luckily, there was always more than one pair to go around. didn't i say payless is great? so finally, she came up to me and told me what she thought i looked good in. it was true shopping camaraderie. i was so touched i wanted to ask for her number before leaving so maybe we could do this again, but was afraid she'd think i'm gay or something. nevertheless, payless is great.  Opinion: i met someone the other day who i coulda sworn was korean. in fact, i had him pegged as one of those cigarette smokin korean squatters. i was bowled over when i found out he was chinese. so the obvious follow up question i asked was, what kind of chinese are you: cantonese, taiwanese, or mainland? he looked me straight in the eye and said, "i'm CHInese." dang. i felt moted. one of these days, i'm gonna get in big trouble for the politically incorrect things that fall outta my mouth. the other day, i met a "white" director. he looked white to me anyway, with a really thick accent. so i asked him if he's italian, and he said no, i'm pakistani. first thought that came to my head was: omg, i'm so sorry. thank goodness i kept my mouth shut this time. when i was younger, i'd been the target of some racist jokes. now that i'm older, i've turned into the racist. i wonder how interracial relationships work. i mean, problems arise even from being with someone of the same nationality, same age, same educational/financial/familial background. different cultural values?? how does that work when you're trying to build a family together? but then again, problems DO arise even if we're the same color, so...maybe race is not the issue...i dunno. but, the chinese guy was right, why did i have to make that subtle distinction? i mean, we're all chinese. to be more general, we're all asian, we're all ppl. and i guess applying that to a general effort to be less parochial, i should stop thinking of every white guy who shows interest in an asian girl as a perv with an asian fetish. That is, only if they stop using the word "oriental," cuz that just makes me feel like a piece of yellow rug.
