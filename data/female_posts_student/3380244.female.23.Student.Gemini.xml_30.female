(1) i let spencer go. drove to the erie canal (his original home) and plopped him back in... he was soooo happy to be back. he kept bobbing his head up and down and swam like such a little champ. i swear he was across the canal in about a minute. i think spencer forgot he was a turtle and is supposed to be slow, 'cause he is quite the swimmer. spencer- i miss you, buddy. (2) i was in wegman's strolling past the flower section when i saw an older man picking out a beautiful bouquet of red roses. he was smiling from ear to ear, it was contagious. i found myself grinning just looking at his happiness. i walked right to the card section of wegman's (i love card shopping) and soon found mr. flowers. he, again, was smiling from ear to ear picking out a card. i'm assuming the card and roses were for the same person and it made my heart melt. he seemed so happy and excited about the gifts... there  are  sweet men out there! (3) i was driving back to my apartment, stopped at a redlight. i glanced in my rear view mirror and saw 2 love birds in the car behind me. the girl was driving, and the guy was the passenger. he put his head on her shoulder and appeared to be singing... while she was smiling and leaning her head against his. they looked really happy.
