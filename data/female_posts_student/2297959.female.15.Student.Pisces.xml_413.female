"about miles" "he wasnt there" "well i know" "why would they say anything?" "since he's expelled and all.." "WHHHAAT???!!!" "you mean you didn't know?" "NO" "oh." not very fun. so i called betsy. and miles. we walked a little and drew parks drove by in his minivan again but he was with someone, we believe to be greg, and it scared us. im tired of talking already. everyone call me. i want to talk to people.
