First- I was validating code on my blogskins.. making sure they were up to par and what not. I'm not even finished with that actually.. I only got a few of them done *ugh*. My second mission was to start working on layouts for my site.. and then I got distracted. My third and final mission was to of course find out if mystery basketball man played on any of the local high school teams. That was a bust. Not one picture... anywhere *tear*. This means that I will of course have to actually ask him for his name.... *coughs spastically* Like that's gonna happen. Maybe, I could like, accidentally bump into him.. or something. That would probably but me on his weird people radar. Who could blame him right? No body knows me cause I'm not in the school system... and... yea. I really dunno what to do.   Besides the obvious heartbreak  I saw an old friend at driving class yesterday. I won't go into great details.. but, since the crap she pulled with me I haven't trusted another person since. Really- she had some major issues. But that's ok cause I'm all the better for it.    Lala-te-da-do.  So- I've gotta go. I know that you love these posts... the ones where... i complain and then don't go into details and leave you hanging hideously (whether it be by my spelling or otherwise) by my very words and then I end it with something like:    Huttah!
