We could have gone to Mickey D's and still had as much fun.Everyone it our group just seems to click. I think we're going to Couger stadium tomorrow or something but I'm not sure.  I worked today. It was long and I'm really tired. I'm sorry its been awhile since I last wrote but I must go eat and recooperate. Goodbye all
