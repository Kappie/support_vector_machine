I actually had an odd feeling that he would be.  I first saw him right before I went into the room in which I was assigned to take the test in. I just gave him a really sweet smile, like one that would be used to greet an old friend.  During the break that we had, I was standing the the hallway talking to Autumn and Bekah, and Matt and (I'm assuming) his girlfriend came up and were leaning against the wall about 10 feet in front of me, behind Autumn. Matt was standing so he was facing me. I know he did that on purpose. What an ass! ...It didn't bother me though. I was just hoping that maybe we would be friends again, but that doesn't seem like it is going to happen. ...I just hope he's not like that at any of the 4-H camps. That would really suck. But, if he is, Joanna would probably be on him like his stupid hair is. :)
