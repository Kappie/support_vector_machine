Hours later I slip into my uniform and head off to work where I face more annoying beeping. Yup, life is good. :P Anyway here's a little about me. I am a junior in high school and I enjoy Lord of the Rings, hobbits, band, gaming, hobbits, hanging out with friends, and oh! Did I mention hobbits? I am currently enjoying my summer vacation and with nothing special that I wanted to do, other than convincing my parents to stay in town. We have to move out of the house by June 28th and they are currently setting their eyes on a different town. Now, Washington is pretty dull but I've come close to so many awesome people I don't really want to move away. Moving to a different town means new school, new band, new job, new everything. So hopefully my parents will have a change of heart before the final decision is made. Thats all for now. Seeya later people!
