I can't scratch them all at once.  I can't use my feet cuz most of the bites are on my legs and I don't know about you but my legs just don't bend that way.  So yeah for everyones future refrence...put bug spray on when your outside.  Why do mesquito bites itch anywayz?  I never have really understood that.  And is it like poision ivy you have to be allergic to it to break out or what?  People...help me out here!  I really love it when you slap one that's sucking your blood and when you slap it, it explodes.  That is the coolest thing ever.  I mean if I slapped everyone as much as I do and we all exploded I don't think there would be anyone left on this planet.  Except me of course.  Because I'm Mighty Micki and the one doing all the slapping duh.  I'm not sure if I would be able to slap Super Maida because he's a super hero too. Actually he's the one who started all of this.  That crazy kid.  But we all still love NICK ANN MAIDA (it's actually David but I've called him Ann since before I can remember)
