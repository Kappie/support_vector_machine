It's completely unneccessary and it's upsetting, because I have no need to screw with the volume.  2) The website is THERE, it can obviously find the server because I'm looking at the website as I'm posting this!  3) I hate having anything other than a plain black desktop, but I'm such a loser that unless I have my schedule clearly visible, I'll forget what I'm doing from one day to the next. But that's only because I have Early Week going on. Once school starts, I'll still schedule myself, but I'll remember it better.  4) More than one row of icons bothers me. AND I don't know what the icon's for but I think it has to do with the fact that my stepdad installed something on my computer as a birthday present and expected me to be aware of it. Or something.  I've wanted to watch Zoolander since Thursday, but I don't think I will, because I'm procrastinating. I still can't believe an entire day just went  by and I haven't done a damn thing. I also think it's sad that it's August, I'm sunburned, and I'm FREEZING in my own house. I have to wear yoga pants and Justin's hoodie to keep warm. And as if that wasn't enough, school starts Thursday, I have no clothes, no supplies, and I'm not mentally ready. Then again, I never am. Last year, I was in summer mood until February, literally. I was asking people what they did over the summer well into October. At least it helped the year go by quickly. I think I'll start a countdown of weeks until school's over. I'll make a paperclip chain and stick it in my purse. I need a new purse. The one I have is the one I made, and it's CUTE, but very impractical. There aren't any pockets and everything's just sorta dumped in there. I want Jenny's purse, it's green corduroy.  How is it possible to have a pimple on my upper lip? Honestly.
