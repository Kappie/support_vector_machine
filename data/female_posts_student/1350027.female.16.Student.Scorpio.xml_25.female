And they say God made everyone equal? Last I checked, 99% of the time I look like shit in pictures. It's always either my eyes are closed, my eyes are half opened, I have a goofy grin, my eyebags are so obvious it could shallow my face or I have this completely stupid grin on my face. And if it's not all that, on the specific day I need to take a photo, I'll have this huge-size-of-China pimple on a specific area on my t-zone.  It's purely bad luck. And I swear the camera is bias.  Having 6 seeds of durian and working out less than half an hour later is just point blank stupid. I have never felt this woozy before. I have constant urges to just throw up all over the place and the stench of durian is just everywhere I go. I wonder if it's just me or there's a faint smell of the leftover durian scent lingering in the house. My fingers are quite frankly the worst thing to sniff at the moment. Someone should remind me to use the spoon next time.  I should shower.  I smell of Malaysian Durian and dried up sweat.
