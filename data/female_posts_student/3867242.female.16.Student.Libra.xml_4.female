But I wanted to post some lyrics of thisawesome song that's starting to get some air play. I first heard about Ryan Cabera from watching "The Ashlee Simpson Show" (I'm truly sick of reality shows..and Ashlee is a bigger brat than Jessica!)..and anyways..Ashlee is dating Ryan. A few nights later I heard "On the Way Down" and fell in love with the song as well as it's lyrics.   Sick and tired of this world  There's no more air  Tripping over myself, going nowhere  Waiting, suffocating, no direction  I took a dive and  [CHORUS]  On the way down  I saw you, and you saved me from myself  And I won't forget the way you loved me  And on the way down  I almost fell right through  But I held on to you  Been wondering why it's only me  Have you always been inside waiting to breathe  It's alright, sunlight on my face  I wake up and yet, I'm alive 'cause  [CHORUS]  I was so afraid of going under  But now, the weight of the world  Feels like nothing, nothing  (down, down, down)  You're all I wanted  (down, down, down)  You're all I needed  (down, down, down)  You're all I wanted  You're all I needed  And I won't forget the way you loved me  All that I wanted, all that I needed and now  [CHORUS]
