"Tomorrow is the most important thing in life. It comes to us at midnight very clean. It's perfect when it arives and puts itself in our hands. It hopes we've learned something from yesterday." - John Wayne.  i found that quote last night, made me all misty-eyed.. among other things.. i like it a lot tho, i think it's true, but no one really ever looks at 'tomorrow' in that kind of a sense..   i need sleep... i should go...      i will always be somewhere being there for you..     with love, - a work in progress.
