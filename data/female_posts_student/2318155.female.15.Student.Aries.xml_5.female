I yell at the for no reason, I'm a bitch towards them for no reason, and I cry for no reason. Lately though i've been doing a lot better. Brandon helped me today when I received 5 minutes notice to the fact that my parents were having company over. This all would be fine if it wasn't for the fact that I was in my undies, hair looked like shit, and my room was a mess. Now usually I don't have to clean my room for my parents friends, but the people wanted to see my tv. Wow was that a hectic time for me. I so badly wanted to scream at my dad, but I calmed down and just moved on. All went fine, we had some Chinese feast over here at my house. I was so stuffed afterwards I felt like I was gonna barf. But anyways, i've been talking with Brandon and wow did we find the best thing to talk about. Cartoons! We were talkin bout Duck Tales, Sailor Moon, The Little Mermaid, Lion King, Speed Racer, The Power Rangers, The Ninga Turtles, Johnny Quest, and so many others; it was the best. It's quite funny how we don't realize how crazy we were about these cartoons when we were little, yet so sad to how almost all of them don't play on tv anymore. I don't think there's really anything else to talk about so...until next time.
