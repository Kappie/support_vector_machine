Song #1  I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears Thats why i need you to hear  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is You [x4]  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you    Song #2  All of you is more than enough for all of me For every thirst and every need You satisfy me with your love And all I have in you is more than enough  You are my supply My breath of life And still more awesome than I know You are my reward worth living for And still more awesome than I know  All of you is more than enough for all of me For every thirst and every need You satisfy me with your love And all I have in you is more than enough  You’re my sacrifice  Of greatest price  And still more awesome than I know  You are everything And still more awesome than I know   More than all I want More than all I need You are more than enough for me More than all I know More than all I can say You are more than enough for me    A girl in my class had the audacity to ask my teacher to play the "un-Christian" song.  I was shocked.  Hello, I go to a Christian school.  One would think if a kid was listening to the wrong music they wouldn't ask the teacher to listen to it in class.  I was bored so I looked up the lyrics to the song and then I put up the lyrics to it and to a song the teacher considers "Christian" because I thought the lack of difference was funny.  No one on the street who heard both songs would ever tell the difference.  No wonder the kids in my school listen to secular music.  Even they don't see the big difference.  There isn't one.
