If I am not mistaken, I think Jeng already forwarded you some of the other pictures that I intended to send you.  It should all be the same pictures.  It all came from Jeff's digital camera.  Next week, Jane and Jhoi will be hanging out with me for my birthday so, I should be taking more pictures then.     CHING:  Thanks for the advice regarding the pictures. I wasn't sure how to measure it by pixels. I'll try my best to post smaller images.  What do you think of the ones I posted in my blog?
