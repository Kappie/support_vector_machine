Not counting early this morning (2 AM) when I woke up with a pounding headache on the left side of my head that I couldn't find a reason for, and was severe enough for me to wonder if there was something seriously wrong with me. Which would have sucked, as my health card is in my wallet which is at Amy's, and had I needed to go to the hospital, I would have been screwed. But, as... twisted luck would have it, the headache was in some way related to the fact that I needed to throw up. Which I did. At approximately 4 AM. After sitting on the couch with Mom, who also happened to be up because her shoulder was bothering her, and holding a hot cloth to my forehead for the two hours in between.   I'm really starting to get annoyed with my stomach. I can't think of anything that should have provoked that. *sighs* Though it might just be my diet in general. Ever since I started this sort of... impromptu weight loss type thing back in December, my stomach problems have escalated. Yet I have lost weight, and I don't think going back to the way I used to eat is going to help much of anything. *shrugs some* Need another visit with the doctor, I guess.   As for the rest of the day... Spent it pretty much depressed and self-destructive. Mostly because of PMS, I'm hoping. Cheered up when Taylor got home from the anime conference in Toronto that he went to, but I actually haven't talked to him much as I rented  The Last Samurai  'cause I figured he would have gotten home at about 11 rather than.. I think it was around eight or nine, heh. Movie wasn't too bad. Bit long. But enh.  My stomach is still bothering me now, even though I forced some rice into it about an hour ago. I'm probably going to end up throwing up again before I can actually get to sleep tonight. *sighs* This bites. Heh. Seriously.
