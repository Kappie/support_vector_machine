Especially on the last snow day of the week (probably), also known as one the more boring points of my life. I just sent Madeline out to get some icy snow to make snow cream.  Joy.  Oh, and my cookies got fucked up.  Wonderful.  I hope snow cream tastes ok with skim milk, ha.  'Cause it's lookin' a little meager in the fridge.  Well, she had trouble scraping it off the trampoline.  I told her to wait until I feel like going outside.  I think she hates me now, and I feel bad.  Ahh, well, she's shut herself in my sister's room with the dogs, so she'll be fine. This thing is depressing, and it shouldn't be because I'm really not that depressed.  I'm just, a little off today, you might say.  As much as it'll kill me to get up at the crack of 6 again, it will be good to be back on some kind of schedule once the ice melts away.  And I missed you all, of course. Becca says that she wonders why people say it never snows here, and she has a point.  It does snow sometimes.  And yet, whenever it does everyone acts like they've never seen it.  I choose to stay inside where it's warm(er.  I'm still cold!) and waste the day eating things and talking online.  And rambling to this stupid thing.  Props if you're still reading it.  You get a gold star. I should go save the dogs from being shut in a small room with a 6-year-old.  They'll thank me.
