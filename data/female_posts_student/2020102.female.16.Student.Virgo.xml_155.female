Sarah: I know, that's why I'm dating you. Erin: Shut up, I could get so much hotter people than you. Sarah: Yeah, well you know that when you get your heart broken you'll just come crawling back to me. (big inside joke - don't ask)  (waiting for daddy to pick me and her up) Sarah: Why is not - I mean why isn't he here yet. Erin: Why is not my here dad?
