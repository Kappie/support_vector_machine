Oftenly, soft and smooth musics will be played when I do my reflections for the day.   This was the time I could just simply listen to the classical and new age musics, and enjoy the soul and emotions of the composer.   It was like the composer and me had already been interwined together.   The closeness feelings was indescibable.   Back to my normal, daily life.   Recently I've watched a Korean movie acted by Kim Rae Won(a new actor full of potential and bright future) and Moon Geun Young(the little EnXi in Autumn in My heart).    This fabulous movie is entitled My Little Bride.   It belongs to the category of comedy-romance.   To me, it was so touching and lovely.   You just couldn't imagine how much laughters and tears were given to me when I watched this movie.   To those who simply love Korean stuffs, this is one of the 5 stars rated movie I greatly recommend.   Ha!Ha! It seems like whenever I wrote my blog, I always recommend movies.   To those who reads my blog, don't be freak out cuz I just can't help sharing my love of movies to everyone I know.   Even if it is in daily life, I always recommend those movies I like very much to the people around me.   August is around tomorrow.   Time flies fast and in a wink, my GCE O level Chinese result will be release soon.   Like others, I will feel panic and nervous too.   God knows how much Chinese meant to me.   I could never ever done badly in Chinese.   It seems like the only thing I am confident that I can fully excel in it.   If I ever gotten a bad result, I guess I will possibly be devastated and will not be able to stand up and have confident back.   Well, I guessed enough of it. I just need to told myself always look on the bright sides of life.
