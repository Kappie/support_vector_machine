I love to be alone, but I just don't feel safe in this house. Yeah. :)  My mum just called. She is at an improv meeting. Fun stuph!  Oh! Tomorrow I have another game and somehow I have to get to katies house SUPER fast. So I hope the game: A. Is not an away game B. Ends fast  That woul dmake me muchas happy. But I just can't leave and not play, I MUST play. I only have like 5 games left! I wanna end the season with a winning record. I am going to practice at my grandmas ALL sunday morning, like from 8-1! Yeah baby.  Oh! School today was CRAZY!  Hahhahahhahahah   I am now stalking this kid named Ryan Fredrick. I memorized his lisence plate number but I seem to have forgotten it.  Oh well! He has cool hair. Disclaimer: I'm not like "madly in love" with him or anything...I just want to be his friend!  OOH! I did the coolest thing with an apple! Its really hard to explain but most of you know it already. It was AWESOME!  Then I ate 3 really fatty granola bars! Yay!  Eric ate 4 haha. I don't know if I like this testing..it seems like I don't get to see all the normal cam people. Most of the people seem to be pretty nice. LIKE CAITLIN! She is from Wisconsin and she likes cheese! I think I kinda scared her though..tomorrow I am totally bringing my ipod. YAY!  I was gonna bring it today but I couldn't find my headphones! Grr!  I also forgot everyones "presents" haha. They are all that great so don't be expecting much. ;)  Wow! I am in the "wahoo i love to type tons of stuff" mood!  Wahoo! ilove ot type TONNNS of stuff!  Laura
