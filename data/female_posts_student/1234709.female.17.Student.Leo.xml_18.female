The excited/nervousy feeling when I talked with Fraser to the completely shafted feeling of be excluded (or maybe just forgotten about) of everyone's plans for Canada Day. I guess everything's all good now though. I think this entry would be a lot easier to write if I weren't so stoned (more or less at the burning out stage).   Anyways, the other day I hung out with John and we went up to this elementary school to meet with his friends Trevor and Andrew. We all shared a joint and talked about Andrew giving up his position at the Cherry plant for another job. I told him if John doesn't take the job then I will, so I really do hope that works out. I'm getting desperate for money. Later we came back to my house and my mom let John take her car to 7 11 for slurpees. Then we watched Final Destination 2. And I felt sick.  Ah, yesterday. Canada day. I went over to John's to watch Kill Bill for a bit and then into town to meet up with Meenoo, Mike and Dylan for some schnazzy hanging-out-age. It was a lot of fun, although we didn't break out the alcohol in time. Dillan and I shared some really nice pot though, and I saved some of my booze for next time. I spent the night at Meenoo's, which also reason why my night was cut a little short, and munched out while watching Conan. I love that man, he's the funniest shit ever.  I spent most of today doing errands and taking the transit back into Winfield and not even being home 20 minutes, John and Jake show up and are all, "hey wanna go smoke some pot?" Heh. We drove out to this foresty type place and to these mining caves to get our fix and then went down to the beach. Again, throwing rocks at eachother; but less violent this time. Finally, we went into Glenmore for Tim Horton's and munched out. It's so much fun hanging out with them. I love it.   I really gotta remember to bring my camera out to play more often. I've had so many "i'm a jackass" moments that could have been captured. Ah well. It'll be trés bitchin' next time, guys.
