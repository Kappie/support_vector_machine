K.) house. we got out every possibility of a homecoming dress for our junior year 80's theme. and body suits. my brother was in the basement so we couldn't just be changing in the general family room so we got out an assortment of spandex body suits and wore them. let me just say, spandex body suits may be the most uncomfortable piece of clothing i have ever worn. anyways, some of the dresses were superb and some weren't. i found stirrup baseball socks that are a nice shade of green. i put on the whole baseball outfit and BCM took a picture and then I (MMK) took a picture of BCM in the yellow beautiful poufy dress. then we did a body suit shot and that was all the pictures we needed. i am enjoying using the initials. BCM MMK MEB KEG. more fun that way. cept i don't know some people's middle name(s). i sort of have many middle names that i can't even spell but they aren't on my birth certificate. here's my attempt- meghan margaret mugilicudy thostesen elizabeth keyes. hmm bad spelling, i am sure of it. they are my mom's maiden name, my grandma's maiden name, elizabeth is my great grandma i think and then margaret was a different great grandma. i was supposed to be a boy. hmph. i am not. my lacey glove is ripping a lot. tomorrow i'm wearing my orange fishnets. to celebrate my not having to wake up anymore. apparently we aren't leaving for missouri until sunday because saturday we have a funeral to attend. of someone i don't really know. a great uncle. i'm not a fan of funerals in general. ha i don't think anyone is a fan of funerals. that was such a stupid thing to say. well uh no one's on and i need to shower, blow dry hair, etc. so i'm off to restock the ketchup.. just kidding.
