Things have been really rough lately.  No one has any time to listen to my problems.  I cried so much over Bio last night while trying to watch the hockey game.  I did really bad on my Bio test, at least for wanting to major in it.  And so then I wonder and think, and really do feel that Bio is the last thing that I totally don't completely suck at.  Worst of all I heard her say that is was the easiest until.  Well easiest for who???  I thought it was the most difficult and did the worst in it, so that especially makes me feel really stupid.  People that admitted they didn't study were like "oh I'm really surprised I got an 80."  IT'S NOT FAIR!  I studied so hard, I mean I always study alot and I knew the concept questions really well.  They always say that if you can answer the concept questions then you will do good on the test.  Well yeah right...did I do the questions - yes, did I do good on the test - no.  See what I mean.  I feel like I did my best.  When I do tests I put my best effort forward and I just feel like I put 110% in the first time and I can't do better.  When I tell people that they just tell me that I am being too hard on myself and too negative.  They don't understand.  I SERIOUSLY DID MY VERY BEST, and the same goes for reading comprehension tests in English.  Everytime I really believe in my mind that this time I can pass, I always end up failing.  I mean of course I feel like I can't do reading comp very well because I just can't!!!  People always tell me don't have this attitude, but they have no idea how much I study for Bio and how important it is to do good in English - yet no matter the circumstances I still seem to screw things up.  I did however ask if there was a re-write in Bio and she said that possibly at the end.  And instead of just ignoring the test I did really I did really bad on, I am going to go over it with her hopefully sometime near the end of next week.  If I figure out where I am going wrong now then I think university might seem a little bit easier.  I also think I could of done better on the test in my comp had been working.  My computer is my outlet.  The one think that has to accept what I say and write no matter what.  The one thing that has no choice but to listen.  The one friend who is always there.  Everyone else works, or goes out, or is never home, or doesn't want to listen to me.  There is more I have to write.  I have been letting all my feelings and emotions build during the time that I didn't have internet.  Now I have so much to get off of my chest.  I am slowly starting to feel better already.  I have more to write but I still want to explore some of the new features of my new laptop so I -will continue with the rest of the very long 'What-has-happened-and-what-I-have-been-feeling-over-the-past-week-and-then-some" journal entry.
