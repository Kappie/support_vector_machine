Well, I didn't really want to go so me and Nate stayed home. I came downstairs at like 11:30 and decided to make mom and dad and nate some blueberry muffins. I made those up and put them in the little cups in the pan, then while they were cooking I unloaded the dishwasher and washed the pans from last night. Then I put the dishes I had used for making muffins in the dishwasher and me and nate had a muffin. Then we watched Finding Nemo for the 3rd time this week. Jordan came over at 1 and got on the computer playing pinball...Me and Nate finished the movie at like 2:45 and I went to take a nap b/c I was on the phone with Jana till 3:30 last night. I woke up at 4:58 and I looked on my phone and I had 2 text messages. They were from drew. The first one was like a yahoo! messenger user is trying to send you a message and then it was telling me how to reply. So then the next message was him asking me if I could give him directions to jesse p.'s house. I just sent a message back saying to call me and id give him directions. I dont know if it got to him, but I tried. It was really wierd, I was like what?!?!? drew??!?! and then I was like how the heck did he get this number!?!?!? It was wierd. So after that I came downstairs and jordan was still here and he asked if I wanted him to help me wash daddy's car again since me and mack didn't quite do the best job when we did it. So me and jordan went out and washed dads car again, and then I kinda helped him wash his truck. After that I came in a watched part of G.I. Jane till 7, then I helped momma cook spaghetti. I called and talked to Jana sometime in between all that and found out her and Lacretia are going to Jacksonville tonight at 9 to pick up chelsea b/c her car broke down. Me, mom, dad, Nate, and Jordan got done eating at about 8:30 and then we just sat around talking about stuff. Momma was telling jordan about how looking at pictures of chris on the internet makes her wanna cry and jordan was like well, imagine how many times christa wants to cry EVERY day, but cant. I said well, Im sure she can, but SHE WONT!! Its crazy to think about...she's going through HELL right now and there's nothing I can do about it! Me, Tyler, Jordan, and momma and daddy are played cards for a little while, but Im about to go get in the shower and talk on the phone for a lil while b/c I have a long day planned for tomorrow!
