I think I just lost another friend...*sigh* Im so bad...It feels like I just got stabbed in the heart...Im in tears...Im so horrible. If I died tonight not ONE person would care...not one. Cuz of all the pain I have caused everyone. *sigh* No wonder I have no friends...I screw em all. Damn. I hate myself. Im so bad. I HATE MYSELF. How could I let myself do this. I've done so much wrong im my life. Nobody will ever forgive me. Right this moment I feel like not one person cares. I cant believe im so bad. I wish I woulda realized it. Now I have. And as I just told Kait 'You should shoot me before I do anything else wrong' I dunno if I'll ever be able to forgive myself.  If only I could redo everything...*sigh* I really hate myself for all of this...im sorry that Im in love...and just wanna be with him. Im sorry if that fucks everything up. Im sorry that I hurt so many people without realizing it. Gosh. *sigh* I dunno what to do anymore....I feel like curling up in a ball and just continue crying and just stay that way for a long time...Heh. I guess maybe I needed a reality check...I guess thats what I got. I hate myself for this...Im soo sorry to everyone...everyone that I've hurt...which is probably alot....probably more than I know. Nobody has any idea how my heart is hurting right now....This pain is the worst. Realizing you've done so much wrong in so little time. Hurting people...friends close to you...that hurts....Maybe I should be the one to quit Youth Council. Just cuz thats where it seems to be the worst...*sigh* I don't know what to do anymore...   -Hurt and Confused.
