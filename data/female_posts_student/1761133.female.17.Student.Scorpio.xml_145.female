(No offense to anyone) But jees...Here's the story...this girl from Wisconson, who is new here, went the freakin wrong way on a one way. She thought the light was green for her...THERE IS NO GOD DAMN LIGHT WHEN ON THE WRONG SIDE!!! Anyways, my brother was teaching me how to drive, and I was going down a street with the lights all green, and BAM outta no where she comes right on the side I was driving. We swerved right, went over a curb, barely missing a tree. I yelled "OH MY GOD!" really loud cause I was not processing what just happened. If my brother wasn't there to help me turn away from the tree, I'd probably be dead right now, and not typing this. Wort experience ever...My brother was about to beat the crap out of her, then he saw she had a baby in the back. But this experience is not gonna stop me from driving...Just beware the one way street...
