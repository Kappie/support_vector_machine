The first being at my own just-created blog, SouthernGent's Dixiefried Text Dumplings. :-D  Your apparently fearless leader Theo invited me here. I'm obviously a Southerner, though not the Redneck I may appear to be. I live in Northwest Florida, and enjoy all manner good food and home shopping channels.  I enjoy talking about Politics, Current Events, Theology, Religion, History and Warfare. I'm quite practiced at writing those words too, because those are all the hot topics at my ezboard, which I've been operating since September 1, 2001.  Other than that, I think it may be fun to post here, and blogging will certainly be a new experience.
