I NEVER TALKED ABOUT MY PRESENT! ok, so there I was...no no no kidding. any way. The week and a half when I was dying, Mike came over on Homecoming to take care of me remember? Well, he had a present for me, it was the Duvall/Seville split CD that I had been wanting since about June. I couldn't  find it anywhere, and he bought it for me. The reason I was so fanatical about it was because Seville has a song called "Jessica" and the lyrices rocked, so I really wanted to hear this band. I couldn't find them to download, so I couldn't even hear if I liked them, but they wrote about Dashboard and a few other bands along those lines...so I thought that I would like them. The CD is wonderful.  Mike, thank you so much for getting it for me, and I love you.
