It seems what it means to me and what it means to him are two totally different things.....  flirt: if you flirt with someone, you behave as if you are sexually attracted to them but without serious intentions.....  why should u want to flirt with anyone else when u have somebody perfectly suitable already? why is it acceptable to be sexually attracted to anyone but the person u r with or a film star etc.  So they may not be serious intentions but they are still intentions.  No matter what status of a relationship, faithfullness is the whole reason it works, because the two individuals don't want anybody else but each other so feel no need to flirt with others...or so I thought.  My heart has been chipped away at so many times over the past few weeks that I'm starting to lose the pieces and am unsure if I can ever put it back together again.  In the car on the way home from a great day out with family (people I forgot I missed and loved) I was willing to try and forget it and put it behind me but it's all rubbed in my face again...so I will now be avoiding the forum as I can't escape it there....  I had a really good weekend...until I got home from work and until I got home from dubach.  To a heart formed for friendship and affection, the charms of solitude are very short lived...(Fanny Burney) :s
