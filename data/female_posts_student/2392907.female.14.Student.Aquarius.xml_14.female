"This partay's erm, good," she says, watching some guy (who is in fact Mickey) slide across the floor and into a table leg. "Yeh." They sit in silence for a while, drinking.  Damn she's hot. Damn he's hot. I wonder what she thinks of me. But not as hot as Adam. Or is he? I must stop thinking about Adam. Is my hair right? But I can't. I'm going out with him.  I wonder if I'll pull tonight. But it was just one dinner I guess. Does that even make us "going out"? She smells nice. I wonder where Adam is.  Maybe it doesn't. Does that mean it's OK for me to think about how sexy this guy is? I hope he's getting loads of girls. He's getting too old too quick. Life's too young to find "somebody speical" yet. He smells nice. Well actually he doesn't, but I'm sure he does normally. And Jesse and Mickey... They are just strange. But Jesse normally ends up with some girl clinging onto him anyway.  This silence isn't so bad. Wow, even awkward silences with him are good.  Ryan smiles at Jane.  And he doesn't do that freaky teeth thing.
