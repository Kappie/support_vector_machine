I found this strange, because he usually keeps his cell phone on. After the sixth or seventh time I tried to call him and I kept finding myself reaching his voicemail, I was about to (1) kill the computerized woman responsible for voice mails and/or (2) break into tears.   Now, don't worry, Garth and I have been dating for more than a year and a half, so I wasn't about to cry because I was worried that things weren't going well. Nope, being the secure girlfriend that I am, I didn't worry that he was with someone else, avoiding me, and/or getting ready to break up with me. No, instead, I was the panicky medical student. For some irrational reason, I convinced myself that he had probably gotten into some kind of accident and was in a hospital bed somewhere unable to call me.   Obviously, I had no choice but to work myself into a big frenzy over this. As a result, I found myself completely unable to fall asleep. So, I sat in my bed, stared at the wall, and hugged Schlepp tight. Yes, we were both worried about Garth, so we tried to comfort one another. Finally and, thankfully, my cell phone rang around midnight. It was Garth! Something urgent had happened at work that he needed to take care of, which was why he was unable to answer his phone and/or call. Apparently, a fight broke out (a bench clearing brawl, mind you) during this softball game that his work was holding. It sounded pretty bad. But, thankfully, no one was hurt. So I'm very relieved.   Unfortunately, I am still unable to fall asleep. Though, the last two yawns I just experienced might be evidence to the contrary. So, perhaps, I should crawl under the covers and try to hit the sack. I bid my readers adieu (a multitude, I know) for now.  Also, of note, I feel like a complete idiot for overreacting. Girls. They're crazy.
