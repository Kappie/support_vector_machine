[i gotta drive on the freeway for the first time coz i drove the whole way there, and i also gotta parallel park for the first time too!! yay!!] anyways, we walked around that crowded place, which was similar to a flea market, for like 2 hours or sum'n. i dont even know how long it was. then we went home and arrived home after 12:30. then i went on the computer for a bit and then went to my bed and read for like 10 minutes and then went to bed. and that was my day   Random Anecdote:  the funniest thing happend last night while i was brushing my teeth. it was like 1:30 and i was super tired. anyways, i was brushing my teeth, and then my toothbrush got stuck or sum'n and it somehow managed to fling toothpaste up my nose and all over my glasses. i was like WHAT JUST HAPPEND? it took me a lil while to realize that ooh. i have toothpaste up my nose. then i realized and did the necessary things to clean up my face. it was hilarious.   Miscellaneous Thoughts:  there is nothing going on in my mind. i have no random thoughts to tell you about. the only thing going through my mind is how the sliding door is open and i am cold and my ear hurts and im hungry. im also thinking about if i like my new "the day, random anecdote, miscellaneous thoughts" setup. it was an idea. tell me if you like it in my tag-board. =D
