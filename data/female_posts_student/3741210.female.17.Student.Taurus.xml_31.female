When I was in middle school, my favorite book series was not the critically acclaimed Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, although both are entertaining, clever and written extremely well.  I loved going on adventures with Frodo, Sam, Harry, and Ron, but I never felt like their magical world actually pertained to my mine, their problems, while thrilling, never were mine.  I loved their lives, but knew I could never live in their fantasy existence.  Alice McKinley was a girl who had a life I could relate to.   The Alice series by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor posed the same dilemma's that I had.  Asked and answered the same questions that bothered me. There must be about 10 or 11 books out and I have read them all.  They start when she's in sixth grade and I think she's now a sophomore.  6th grade is time when you're outgrowing the junior section of the library but not quite ready for the teenage section.  Alice, a book  about  a 6th grader was my bridge into new territory.  I avidly read all of her books wishing she was real and I could be her friend.  When I heard they were going to make a movie, I knew I was perfect for the starring role.    But I am fast outgrowing Alice.   There are 3 books to every year of Alice's life, and while at one point we were the same age, I have finally surpassed Alice.  A sad thing, like losing a close friend.  She got me through some tough times and for that I'll always be thankful.  And while I'll still probably read the Alice books, they aren't quite for me anymore.  They are for the thousands of others yet to discover her, and in doing so, will discover themselves.
