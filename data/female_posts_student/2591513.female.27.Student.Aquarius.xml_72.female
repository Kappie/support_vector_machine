So in my inability to sleep because of the constant thought my my head problems, I am going to generate a list of the positives of the past year or so.    Positives    *Emily Love was born. *Ed came back home to us safely. *Bailey is continuing to do well healthwise. *We have a beautiful home. *God has reminded us of the valuable friends and family we have. *Our continued health. *Ed getting his AA. *I am back at school.  I am sure there are many more things I have forgotten.  The top few are enough.  I have been blessed with an amazing family and that alone is enough.  By the birth of my children and by the saving of Ed during that war He has shown me that I am not forgotten.  I think in the hustle and bustle of life we get consumed by our fear.  Maybe that is what has paralyzed me.  Maybe my fear has made it hard for me to function as I should.    As I write this, I realize that I have to put my faith in God's will for me and my future.  I have to have faith in His love for me and my family.  I have to have faith in God.  If I lose faith in God I lose everything.  So in this journey before me, I will have faith in God and what He has planned for me.  I pray for strength and courage.  I didn't mean to get so spiritual, but something is renewed in me.  There is a peace that is settling within me and calming my tortured soul.  With that, I pray that you all never lose faith in God and always relaize His presence in our lives.  I am embarrassed to say that through all this I almost lost sight of that.   Have a great week.  I am sure mine will be better.
