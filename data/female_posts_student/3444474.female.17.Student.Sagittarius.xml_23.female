I'm even getting an iSight webcam with it. 'tis a beautiful thing. And it's still under $1,500, that is so exciting.   I haven't done much else today, it's just been a nice day. It rained, which was nice. My mom got me a bouquet of beautiful sunset roses...for no reason at all, lol. They're so pretty. I felt special, teehee.  In other news, I'm totally insane emotionally this week due to the fact that I was born of the female persuasion, therefore if my emotions seem odd, don't worry, it will all pass soon enough.   I feel so lovesick :) 'tis a beautiful feeling, especially when totally random.   I just love my life today.   *grins happily*
