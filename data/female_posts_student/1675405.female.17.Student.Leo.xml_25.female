But, I am trying my darndest to remain relatively positive, because once I let myself fall down a few notches, it's pretty darn impossible to lift me back up.   I went shopping lastnight at Walmart with some of my paycheck money. I got some sweet new makeup, which I so desperately needed, a new blowdryer, and a few knicknacks that I really liked. I still have $40.00 left, and no spending that! I'm saving for homecoming, not to mention Chicago. BUT.... Mom said she'd give me $100 on top of my $100 from wreath sales last year. Now, if I could sell at least a few wreaths this year, I'm set to go!!   Homecoming is rapidly approaching, and I really would like to go with a date.  But, that's probably not going to happen, so I've already got my 2 best friends, Heather and Marie, as backup dates. :-) I need to go airbrush tanning, get some new shoes, shaper, and I'll be set.
