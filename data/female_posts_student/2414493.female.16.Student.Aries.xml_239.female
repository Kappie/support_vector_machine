Organizing. Reading. Everything to drive me nuts.  Here I just want to cry. Gosh darnit.  Dear lord, it's funny how she lectures me on being out all day when she's guilty of the same crimes. If they can even be called crimes. I'm just inexplicably angry right now. I don't know why--that's the point.  How can Mom be so naive?  Thinking of things I need to pack, I don't know what else I should include. Everything else is still in use or isn't here or already in the suitcase. There's no use in overpacking.  I can't think clearly right now.  Today was a good day. Until Mom ruined it for me. Ha.
