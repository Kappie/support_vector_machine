Don't be biased because its a Christian group. They are awesome lyrics whether you like the band or not!    Quest of Many Trials   If your tears want out than let them fall, They'll hit your cheeks and then dissolve. You see nothing heals quite like time, It fills the gap between dreams and real life, So give your pain a chance to run itself dry.  Remember the story without all the hurt, Hold on to the fruit and wash off all the dirt. You see life's bittersweet, and sweet's the best part. You'd never rate your happy, without sad on the chart.  (Chorus) Stars colliding against the dark of the night, You'll climb over the moon tonight, On your quest of many trails.  Remember, will you remember who brought you here? Remember, o will you remember who brought you here? Remember, will you remember?   That's a great song.  It's by  urlLink Plus One . I'm not infatuated with their stuff but I do like some of their songs like "Last Flight Out" and "Kick Me". That's not all I listen to though. I listen to lotsa other stuff. But right now I don't feel like listing the groups.   Why so worn?  School- first day back. I had make up work stacked about a mile high, including an Algebra II semester final. *gaaaaaaa* *throws a TI80 or w.e at the wall* Surprisingly I remembered stuff, and was able to crack out a solid 8 questions before going into deep brain-fry mode. Suddenly I was thinking in mathmatical terms like, if I had a matches and b amount of lighter fluid how long would it take to burn z amount of school work. Don't get me wrong, I'm a brain child. I just like to complain about it, because that's what I do.   Great now it looks like I actually posted  Crap! I'm a typa-holic! Well not really but I made a New Year's Resolution to blog at least every other day if not everyday. Some people might say, "So what! No one ever keeps their New Year's Resolutions". Maybe their right, but this year I got Mista Jiggyfly cheering me on so you know I got to make him proud. (For those of you just joining me, Mista Jiggyfly is my Barnes and Nobles bear. Some of you may be questioning why I have to make him proud, well, its something you would have to know me for to understand it.)    Um, now I'm going to stop typing and end the blog with a tongue-pleasing and funny phrase     Cheerio!
