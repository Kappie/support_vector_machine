In great trepidation, she tears  open  the envelope and reads the enclosed letter, her heart in her shoes.      Dearest Mom:      I am so happy; I have eloped with my new boyfriend.   I have found real passion and he is so nice, with his piercing and special  tattoos, especially the one with my name in a heart.  I just love his  big motorcycle, but it's not only that, Mom, I'm sort of pregnant and  Yaqui  (that's Swahili for "Warrior Prince") said that we will be very happy in  his trailer in the woods.      He wants to have many more children with me and that's one of my  dreams.    I've learned that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone, so we'll be  growing it for ourselves and Yaqui's friends, who will swap for all the  cocaine  and ecstasy drugs we want.      In the meantime, we'll pray for the science to find the AIDS cure, for  Yaqui to get better.      Don't worry about me, Mom, I'm 15 years old now and I know how to take  care of myself. Some day I'll visit for you to know your grandchildren.    Your daughter,    Melissa Louise     PS: Hey, Mom, don't freak, none of this is true. I'm at Judy's house.    I just wanted to show you there are lots worse things in life than the  report card in my desk drawer . . . Love you, Missy
