Then, school and band overtook my life.  Between honor band and bazillion projects/tests in my classes, I wasn't all too happy.  But then we had exams (which were not bad at all, considering I only had 2).  And then state solo contest was this past weekend.  I got a 1, so at least that ended on a good note.  We had lots of fun too :)  Awesome roomies! (Lisa, Leah, Jessica)  There's going to be so much band this summer, omg.  Sectionals every Thursday, leadership stuff this Friday, 2 percussion camps, leadership camp, full band camp, asldkfjalsdkjfalsdkjf.  Oh well - at least Lisa is the flute section leader!!  And we will have oodles of fun because we are SENIORS and All-State buds.  Graduation was today... it wasn't as long as I thought, but it was still long enough, that's for sure.  It was so crazy to see almost every one of my friends walk across the stage.  In the past, it's always been sad for me to see people leave (like Vivian, Kate, Mary, Habibi, etc.), but I didn't get nearly as upset as this year.  I didn't cry or anything, but my mind was racing- it's so weird for me to think that these people who I surround myself with all the time, every day, will be gone from my life (possibly forever) in a couple short months.  It will be a major, and involuntary, change for me.  I don't want any of you guys to leave!  And though everybody always says this, please stay in touch.  So, I thought I'd mention all of my graduating friends and thank you each individually for the impact you've had on my life and what you've meant (and still mean) to me.  *Wow, I'm starting to tear up as I write this...*   Charles:  not much to put in words- I think you know what you mean to me.  Thank you so much for all the incredible memories and for being my best friend.  I will miss you immensely next year- don't ever forget me :)  Leah:  I've known you for 3 years, and every year, we've gotten closer.  You are an AWESOME girl and I love you to death.  I still remember making fun of Russ in 2nd band my freshman year with you... we've been friends ever since!  I'll miss sitting next to you in band next year.  Just make sure you come back and visit me (and Lisa)!  Ross:  Dude.  You rock.  Remember when we went to Homecoming together my freshman year?  I barely knew you- yet Rebecca insisted we go together!  The start of our friendship :D  My Catholic pal and an all-around GREAT guy, I will miss you bunches next year.  But I will see you when I join you at A!!  And we'll throw rockin' parties.  Mooney:  Moonerz - you are incredible.  You have the world in your hands and are capable of  anything - never forget that!  Good luck at MIT next year.  I know I will see you in the future (when we're teaching in the same school district, duh)!  Nick, Disen, Bob, and Liz:  Nicky poo and Disen- thanks for making drumline one of the best experiences of my life!  You will be GREATLY missed next year.  Bob and Liz- go double reeds!  Though you left me, Liz (*tear*), we still had a lot of fun times.  Be sure to come back and support the  new  drumline!  Danny and Nathan:  I had a great time with you guys at All-State!  You two are hilarious.  Thanks for the fun times... Danny, stay out of trouble with the Marines, and Nathan, high five!  Eric:  We've had some... well... humorous memories (oh, those middle school years).  I will always be able to look back on that and laugh!  And remember when you go to college: church every Sunday.  No excuses.  Good luck at Purdue and with the rest of your life.. don't forget your best pal, though!  Good luck to everyone next year, with whatever you do, but come back and visit me in this lovely town of Coppell (though I know you'll probably want to get as far away as possible).  Thanks for the good times.  I love you all!  And, as usual... Cool song alert! Hoobastank - "The Reason"  (I don't know why, but I cannot seem to get this song out of my head!)  Until next time, this is Melissa signing off!  *This post is dedicated to my sister Lindsay who bothered me enough to update this thing.
