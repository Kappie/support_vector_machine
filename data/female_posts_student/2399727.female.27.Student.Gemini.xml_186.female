The organist chose  urlLink Marty Haugen's "Gather Us In"  for the opening hymn, which the parishioners do not know.  There were perhaps three people singing in the entire church excluding myself and the organist.  It's just an incredibly chromatic, fast, jumping kind of piece and it isn't very user-friendly.  Despite hearing a verse or two, it's not an easy thing to pick up and so people were not singing, including the priest.  After we had finished the third verse and the organist threw in a big ritardando to bring the "singing" to a halt, there was a very telling, extended pause before the visiting priest said, "Well... okay... then.  Let's start this thing.  In the name of the Father etc."  I chuckled as I blessed myself -- it was as if the music so badly interrupted his thoughts he was just speechless.   At the end, he lost his list of announcements but did remember to mention that the ushers were handing out cigars for all the fathers after Mass.  He then shook his finger sternly and admonished, "But ONLY for the fathers, okay kids?"  We all laughed.   urlLink     urlLink     More to come...
