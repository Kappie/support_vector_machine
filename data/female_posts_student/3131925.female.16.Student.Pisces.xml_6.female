Then they got my gun working so we went back out into the dunes and I went after some birds...since all the bums were like..hiding or something lol. We kinda sorta planned the whole bon fire thing. But tonight I'm goin on Strand, gettin wasted with the girls, theeen buyin some more vodka to bring to Clint's. So when tonight's over I'll have a lot more to say and this post will be a hell of a lot more interesting.
