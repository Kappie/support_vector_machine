My boss was actually the one who pointed that out to me, not by giving me flowers or a card thanking me for all my hard work, but because he thought it was a bunch of bullshit but wanted to make sure I wasnt offended.  HAHA!!  I was like, "oh yeah, so I should expect my flowers when I get home?" and he just cringed.  I know he knows I'm not serious.    Actually, my greatest fear is that he (they) asks me to lunch.  I HATE lunching with the bosses.  Even when I get along with them, it just feels so strained and contrived.  I mean, if I'm truly myself, I fear I may lose my credibility or respect (because I curse too much or I say or ask something too personal).  If we both get along swimmingly, then they fear I wont take their demands seriously enough.  If we're both too stiff, it just makes for integestion.  I mean,  really , people...   I've been friends with my bosses before and its only ended up badly.  One was my friend and then he became my boss and fired me for a bullshit reason.  He took what I said to him in confidence - about hating my job - and used it against me when they were restructuring.  Like, "Well you hated it there anyway..."  No, motherfucker, I hate  YOU.   Then there was the bosses that I became friends with after I worked there.  One, I had a mini-crush on her boyfriend, not good when hanging out as he was very flirty in general.  Another boss I ended up sleeping with.  NOT GOOD.  (sexually AND mentally, ha!).    Now and again, I make friends with someone higher-up that I've worked  with , but never  for  and it becomes a beeauuutiful friendship, like Gary or Joe.  Hi Guys!!  [frantically waving]  But I digress. Where was I?  Oh yes, I got no flowers.
