I'm not really a fan of the 'in bed by 2, up at 1' schedule, but I seem to be getting there.    Found my long-lost thumb-ring.  "Oh yea, I found that right after you left." Mom said as I came gasping into the room with my prize.  Put my favorite Sony Discman to rest.  It's been with me since 9th grade; it was time.  Bought a new mobile CD player.  It's jog-proof; just in case I get crazy.  Went for the middle of the higher end brands, Magnavox, because Sam, my cute RCA boombox, has been acting up and I refuse to pay $70 for a Sony.  It has a Digital FM Tuner Radio; long playing time; Digital Dynamic Bass Boost (that was the clincher for me); and all CD program modes (made damn sure we had random!).  It will come in handy when the parents and I fold ourselves into the pick-up and do the Oregon coast thing next week.  I'm leaving out the part where I bought it at the Evil Empire; perhaps I should name it Walt.  I felt like asking the female employees if they're part of the 1.6 million.    Gave Harley a bath in the driveway.  Didn't get to the business about cleaning the inside, but she's pretty damn sparkly on the outside.  And that's what matters most.    Got Harley's oil changed.  Was about 1,000 miles late, so decided it would be a good idea before heading to Bozeman Friday.  My cooling system fluid is a lovely rust color; they tell me it should be green, but I won't have to worry about it til winter, so I just won't.    Watched Kill Bill Vol. I with Dad.  He quit narrating ("Got his knife"; "Kid's home from school.") about an hour in and seemed disappointed and confused at the end.  Just made me want Vol. II more.  They really shouldn't be watched by themselves, there's too much missing.  But Uma looked especially good on the huge, high-definition TV and that's a very good thing.      Cracked the half-way point in Book 4.  It's the day of the First Task and it's so intense.  Loving every damm thing about it.  The tension between Harry and Ron...they should just make out and get on with it; Hermione and her crusade to save the house-elves while repairing Harry and Ron's relationship in between studying for class and helping Harry be Champion; Mad-Eye and his moods (bad pun, I realize, but the best I can do on the fly); and the British edition with its non-Americanized language.  I love queues!  And being on about something!    Rented "Welcome to Mooseport" (for Mom; she, like everybody, loves Raymond) and "In America" (for me; I, like everybody if they know what's good for them, love Irish immigrants).  And on a completely random note, go  urlLink Seattle lawyers .  Props to The General for the link.
