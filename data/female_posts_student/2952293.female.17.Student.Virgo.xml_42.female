You're so cute, you rock my world!" HI, THEY'RE 8! Anyways, after that disgusting show, we watched a movie and then they went to bed. I came downstairs to get my flip flops and I could only find one. I got on my hands and knees, but the other one was gone! Then I found it... the dog completely chewed and destroyed it. AHH. The dad gave me a pair of his, yeah that'll do a lot of good. I babysat this morning with Veda. Veda has been to Estonia, I mean who at this age has been to Estonia?! She is going to China next spring break with her traveling violin group. That's crazy. But again, she asked me how much hair I cut off then proceeded to go on and on about how she always tells her friends to NOT cut their hair. Veda, what are you trying to prove here?  I just got off the phone with my aunt, it was a great conversation: Aunt Sharon: "I just got off the phone with Sally and I told her about your trip to Indianapolis last week. She thinks your crazy." Me: "If you think that's bad, just guess what I'm doing next." Aunt Sharon: "Oh god where are you going now? Kentucky?" Me: "Nope, further." Aunt Sharon: "Florida?!" Me: "No, try Southwest." Aunt Sharon: "What's it start with?" Me: "T" Aunt Sharon: "Let's see, Tennessee? No, that's not Southwest, wait, no, not Texas..." Me:  breaks out into extreme hysterics  "YES!" AHH my aunt started FREAKING out. She was going on and on about how she is going to come down here and meet Anna, who I'm going with, and all that. Nobody thinks I can do anything! Well, I will show them... when I come home knocked up with Ace's baby! WHAHAH just kidding.
