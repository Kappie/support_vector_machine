Maybe I should pay more attention in class. *wink*  I stayed up all night just reading an online comic titled  urlLink "RPG World" . :D It's funny, taking up all the stupid things in RPGs like repetitive battles and stupid heros. Lol. Most of the puns were rips from the FF series. :P The thing is, the comic has been up for three years, so I read three years worth of comics. 0_o Hekhek, bad for the eyes... @_@ But once I started the story, I figured it would be too much a hassle to stop then and begin again tomorrow.  Oh yeah... I saw Racine's date to the Prom!! :P He's got a nice smile. Plus he's megane. Lucky Racine. :P Speaking of the prom, now my dad wants me to have a date. > It's not like I don't want a date, it's just that I'm not sure if I'll like my date. I mean, a bad date can ruin a prom.. Of course, me, being me, I'm expecting too much of the prom. Ergh.. *mumble stupid prom mumble mumble*
