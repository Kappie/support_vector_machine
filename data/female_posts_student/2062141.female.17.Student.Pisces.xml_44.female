I'm going to do so much Christmas shopping tomorrow. Cause it's CHRISTMAS season now! I love Christmas.  Why does Thanksgiving put me in a mood for musicals? Last night I watched Sound Of Music, and...tonight, tonight...i'm watching West Side Story (did ya catch my little joke, did ya?) No probably not because you guys aren't as big of dorks as I am. I freaking love West Side Story. And I'm telling you right now I cry every time. OO and then on Sunday, I'm gonna go see a production of the Wizard of Oz in Seattle... which as you guys know is my ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIE EVER. k well Happy Thanksgiving!
