Ultimate basketball, "you can't handle the booty," "chunky booty," swimming olympic jumps, walking in the desert for hours, singing along to girly movies, "let's make a hit list to become valedictorians...oh by the way, Nicholle you're on it," "finally, something Nicholle's not good at," music drama, exercising, "Surfing USA," and the dance floor.   I spent like no time actually in my house today. Girls' afternoon with AB, Becca, and Britt was fun. Of course, we watched portions of my video library including The Lizzie Maguire Movie and How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days. Good, girly movies. Britt and I sang along at the end of Lizzie because as we say, the music at the end saves the whole movie from totally sucking.  Swimming all afternoon until then deciding to watch Jeopardy, then playing Ultimate Basketball *yes it's capitalized because now it's our sport,* then going back to the pool, eating some cake...mmmmm...then talking about music drama galore.  During basketball, we discovered that Nicholle is not just a smart girl, she plays basketball too, haha. It was too funny. Brittany got a tad intense and Natasha resorted to physical violence. Her friend from Roselle is really cool too. Caroline and Diana got crazy with their "You can't handle the booty" team slogan. It was too much fun for a basketball game. Now Caro and I are gonna kick some butt in tennis to prove our skill, and I'm a hero...I saved a life, well sort of.  With all of this going on, I was having an amazing time, but also thinking about some stuff in the back of my mind. I was surprised at how many times a certain name came up, despite the person not being there. There wasn't much associated with the person either, but the name kept being mentioned in some form or another. Its frequent mention hit me since I really hadn't thought about the person in a long time, well in a while since we haven't talked since one strange, akward conversation, then an abrupt goodbye out of bitterness.   It sort of made me wonder if I'd ever be friends with the person again, but then I remembered I hadn't done anything wrong. I don't need to blame myself. I don't need to wonder if we'll talk again. It's really not my problem. The first move is up to that person because I feel the person owes me more of an apology than I could possibly owe in return. And with me leaving on Monday for a month, well ugh, now with all this annoying paperwork drama, I BETTER be leaving on Monday, then being home for a really short time before leaving the country, I don't know if we'll have a chance to fix things before it's way too late. And if it becomes too late, I wonder if whatever happens is what is meant to happen. If I say yes, then maybe we're not supposed to be friends past this point.   So yeah, I guess if I were to ask a question that you guys could answer later, it'd be : "Do you agree that certain people are in your life for a set amount of time, to touch it or affect it or teach you something and then when their time is up and it's time for them and you to move on, that's it?" I think I agree. "Are there only a limited group of people with whom you're supposed to share your entire life or do we lose people because of our own faults, our own shortcomings, our own petttiness?" So think about that.
