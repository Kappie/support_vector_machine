At one point there was too much pressure where it was rather hard trying to breathe. And then after that the only people capable of standing on their two feet ready for more was Dan. Where as Ben looked a little sick, and Nick.. Well lets just say that  it was not his cup of tea. Just like the drop of fear isn't mine. They forced me on it. And I wasn't very "happy happy joy joy" about it. It's too High! I hate heights. And yea. But ironically I love the Ferris wheel. I don't know there is something about that ride that makes me feel relaxed and stuff. It's a great ride.  Oh and the carnie couldn't guess my weight. Which was kind funny I guess... pshh I fooled him! Hahah! Go Donna!
