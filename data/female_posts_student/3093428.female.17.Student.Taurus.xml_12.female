I hated home. Going to college was the out. I didn't have to deal with anyone! It was truly great. I went almost a month and a half without calling.   The question you need to ask yourself is "Am I (enter stop mom's name here)'s child, or is (enter step mom's name here) my Dad's wife?" What this means is...from HER point of view. Is her priority to her children, or to her husband, or is it balanced? Are her nagging endeavours motivated by mischief or by nature to protect, nurture?   These questions are easy to answer while emotioned... "She's just a lame bitch that wants to ride my ass all day. She's no good anywhere." I know what that feels like. But don't be disceved. This may not be your step-mom.  I don't know what it's like to lose family. I can imagine that you must feel something akin to how invasive her presence is, that she doesn't belong there. Just know that no one can ever replace your Mom, no one will ever be the same that she was. Your step-mom is a completely different person.   "You don't know someone till you walk a mile in their shoes". Tell me you all know where that comes from...  Put yourself in her shoes. You are your step-mom. Are you a mom, or are you a wife?
