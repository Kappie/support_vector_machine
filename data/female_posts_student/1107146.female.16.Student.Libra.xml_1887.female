Happy Belated Birthday Liz.  Unless it's not late and everyone was just considering it a "Birthday Weekend,"  in which case, it could be today.  So, Happy Birthday. But if its a "Birthday Weekend," then it coud've been yesterday, which would make it late.  Happy Belated Birthday Liz.  I suppose, also it could've been Friday, because that's when Scott's post was, which makes it really late.  Happy Really Belated Birthday Liz.  Man, I want some chinese food.  Yup.  So, college life is fun.  I played cards with a bunch of people last night until about 1:00 AM, then got a movie from this really creepy guy, watched some of it and then decided it was really stupid and made no sense whatsoever.  Then I went to bed about 2- 2:30, something like that and got up today at 1 in the Afternoon.  And thats early on a Sunday to get up.  Seriously, my sister and I were walking around and there was like NO ONE there. It was weird.
