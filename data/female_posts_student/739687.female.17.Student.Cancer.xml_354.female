People are depressing.  Even when people are happy, they are depressing.  Not the way they act, or carry themselves, but the things they say.  It is the way that people make everything into such a facade. Tell me what you did yesterday.  What you're going to do this weekend.  Your favorite moment. Tell me all the things about your life. 'Nothing' is an impractical lie, and anything else is depressing. Even if yesterday was the best day of your life, it was depressing.  Maybe not for you, maybe not for me (maybe for me?), but for someone.  Something in everything we say is destructive.  Something leaves a knot in someones stomach when you speak. Don't convince yourself that I'm preaching about self-hating, humanity-hating, or even hating you (far too much self consciousness/pompousness, though I too and victim of such self accusations).  It's not about hate.  I don't have hate (I would throw in some humourous little blurb of something that happened yesterday, but why waste the energy right?) for anything really. People are just depressing.  Why?  Because nothing can make a person happier than themselves.  Other people are always a let down.  All acts have the underlying purpose of one thing: self.  The self is the only thing that humanity has to offer that wont depress you.  When someone speaks, they depress you.  Because they are themselves, and your own self wants to deny their relevance. No one wants to submit to the relevance of anything else but...what? Themselves. And that is why we all speak.  Because when we speak we are reassuring ourselves. And we ramble on and on either with our without coherence, tactless or thoughtful: we will talk.  Even the quiet ones who hardly utter a word; in their minds they speak.  And why do the quiet ones seem so shy and reserved?  It is their depression of listening to everyone else. A pitiful cycle. Language is the most self gratifying purpose mankind has ever proposed. "Let us speak, and love the words we utter."  Depression is found in the words of others, and the cure is sought after in dumbfounded incoherence.   Thanks crazies. I think I've completely lost it.
