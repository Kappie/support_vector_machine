And I don't think that is really such a big lie, because after all, my coworkers DO make me sick to my stomach.  4:35 A.M - watch Valley Girl on HBO.  Like, for sure, it's a totally tubular movie!  Quick overview of the movie ...  She's cool. He's hot. She's from the Valley. He's not.  I've decided that the next retro flashback itching should totally be the VALLEY GIRLS.  Like why hasn't anyone thought about this before - duh? Its the perfect time. There's a Republican in the White House, guys are wearing mascara, hair-rockers are making a comeback, and Madonna never left. So the only thing missing from the eighties are the valley girls, or Vales, as they're known.  And yes. When I was like, 13, I thought it was so cool to be a Valley girl. I must have been on drugs.  The Valley Girl is a cult classic. Released in 1983, it starred Nicholas Cage and Deborah Foreman. She was the Valley Girl from Encino and he was the bad boy from Hollywood. It has a classic Romeo and Juliet theme; imagine like, hello, where art though. It was not so mainstream when it was made essentially because the valley girl was a local San Fernando Valley phenomenon. The posh suburbs housed the collective group known as the valley girls who had an entire culture built around a somewhat snobby attitude and great clothes and hair. Someone got the brilliant idea to make a movie out of it. Anyway, if you haven't seen it, rent it, it was a good flick.    Totally Tubular, Valley Girl.  5:25 A.M. - Return to bed. Yes, I didn't finish watching the movie, but I own it, so I can always watch it later. However, at this time I have a strange dream that included Deborah Foreman. I guess, I joined the Valley Girl gang. Lucky me.  6:15 A.M - Go to gym. Burn off my beloved booze.  7:00 A.M - Stop at Starbucks, and get a Caramel Frapachino. Yum. All the calories I just burned, have been replaced. Plus, I gained some additional calories as well.   Bastards.  8:oo A.M - Shower. Dress. Do all those lovely things that need to be done so I can face the world.   And well, now here it is 9:00 A.M and I am writing this blog. And then it's checking my email. And then ... I'm off to San Diego for the day. I'm headed down there with my best friend, so she can pick up her guitar.   Hey. Who knows. She has a guitar. I have a bass. It isn't entirely impossible, that we are in the making, of a brand new punk band.  Now we just need to learn how to play.   * * * Valley Girl money quotes:   Fred:  So, you wanna dance?   Girl:  In another life!   Fred:  Yeah, I didn't either. I was just taking a poll.    Randy:  That techno-rock you guys listen to is gutless.   "What I'm trying to say, Julie, is that it's really hard for me to say what I'm trying to say."  Tubular. I know.
