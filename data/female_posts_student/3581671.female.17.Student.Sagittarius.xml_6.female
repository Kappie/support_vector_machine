I ran in a race this weekend and did OK.  I'm not too nervous that I'll fail, it's only June after all.  I got really bored last night so I straigtened my normally out of control wildly crazy curly hair.  I think I'll wear it straigt to practice in the morning so maybe I can try and look cute for 'someone'. :o) talk to you all lata! toot toot, katie       I believe in a thing called love, just listen to the rhythm of my heart lalalalalala  I wanna kiss you every minute every hour every day!
