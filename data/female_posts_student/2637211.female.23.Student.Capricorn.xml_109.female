Yesterday Jerm and I went to the farmer's market with his sister and we bought a lot of cheap organic food, then got lost driving around Oakland looking at houses, then we tried to find a crepes place downtown only to find it closed. We ended up going to crepes-a-go-go in north berkeley, which was a drive, but yum! I had a banana and nutella crepe. Yummy.   Spent the morning being lovey-dovey cuddley with Jerm, and finally got back. I spent the drive contemplating myself, and almost got hit my a madman in an explorer. I hate those bastards in SUVs. They just want to kill the rest of us while using up too much fossil fuels. Ass-faces. Now I'm hungry and deciding about when to go to the grocery store. Lisa's roasting a chicken, and I want to make cous-cous and salad to go with it. Sounds tasty, and healthier than Lisa's normal offering of mashed potatoes with half-and-half.
