Noah woke up at 12:30a in the morning screaming and crying and had to come to bed with us. I had just gone to bed when he woke up so i didnt get any sleep. Then when he woke up this morning he was still crabby i think he is getting another tooth or something. I also feel like i am getting a cold but thats no surprise all the kids at daycare are sick so.......   I also came across somethings that i didnt really need to see and that has me in a supper foul mood.I feel so confused and like i just really wanna scream.I should be studying for my test on EKG's on thursday but you know what? Right this minute i just dont give a shit.   On the flip side things with Tish are still going really well and we havent had any serious problems in the last 2 weeks. We have finally realized some of the things that make each other tick and are working on them. Doesnt help that we are both PMSing at the same time but we are working on it. We are just starting our 9th month as a couple and our 8th month of living together. "It's not always rainbows and butterflies it compromise that moves us along"Hmm Where have i heard that before? We had actually gotten to the point where we were going to give up. Then almost as quick as we had decieded that we fell right back in love. It was a pretty amazing thing. We both werent sure we had it in us to make it work but somehow or love is finding a way. So i think ill go read my book and take a nap while the house is quiet.
