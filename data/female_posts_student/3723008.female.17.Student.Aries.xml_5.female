Globe, twice in one week, new record!!... Garfield was seriously... an "E".. (For you non-Harry Potter people, its "Exceeds Expectations")... I was expecting a crappy movie with a crappy computerized garfield... but it was actually funny... Odie was a dummy.. but Garfield's wisecracks were entertaining enough. Once more, that stupid Britney/Beyonce/Pink Pepsi commercial pissed me off to no end. The only good thing bout that is Enrique. Congrats to Portugal.. *clap clap*... I didn't see the game yet, so I can't say that they played well haha.. Although I have heard it from a lot of people... I'd look at the replay tonight :).. Plans for tomorrow are cancelled, no longer would my eyes be feasting on international school boys.. arrggghhhh feck man I need to talk to Danah and she's spending the night by bretts and fuego... GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR... ok .. Somebody who knows whats going on in my life?... It's time for one of you to come online now.. I need to vent to people who would actually know why I need to vent... which isnt large group... damn me for being so selective.. I... WANT... MY... DANUS... shit man... I'm still working on begging my mom to let me to go Bravo Bravo to see my beloved Krucifix... Kris said he'd come beg for me  also, so all you people reading this, say a little prayer... 2 little prayers... one praying for me to get to go... the other praying for me to be safe... So all in all, today was a good day, some parts erm... good-ER than others.. (*wink*)... i hope i can do it again some time .. (*WINK*).. but ahm get started earlier hahha... *bad stephie*... . Gym was ok, came home n played some cards with Riyad.... was TOLD by Dane that he'd carry Val and I for aus kreem, but left gym before yoga was done.. ok.. i'm going to go do something Val buffing me for whole evening. It smells good, leave me alone .. ;)... Hasta       Cogito, ergo doleo. I think, therefore I am depressed.
