Today - went to St. Louis to a shoe store and also picked up Charles. Got some cute shoes. Then I went and rode Al this afternoon and didn't go as well as I wanted and I was kinda pissed because his canter is not good at all. He's all tight on his front legs and it's so frustrating because I don't know why he's doing this. He just needs to get back in shape. The whole time I kept thinking of how awesome it would be to be back up at Kim's and actually have him in show condition. And these freaking chickens are always running and squawking all over the ring and it's annoying as heck, and these dudes outside were vaccinating some cattle, which Al absolutely hated because he's never really seen cattle before. But these two old cowboys were there and they looked pretty impressed, so I had fun doing a bunch of fancy leg-yields and changes across the diagonal at the canter hehe. Everyone at this barn rides western and I'm the only english rider there and they were like, "Wow, is that an Arabian??" :-P  Yeah, not much going on here. I have to work on Thursday and Saturday and then I don't know when else after that. I've worked at this place only twice and I already don't like it much. Haha. Oh well.
