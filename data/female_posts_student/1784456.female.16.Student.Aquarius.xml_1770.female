Ok, so maybe stress is always an issue... or maybe it's all in our heads seeing as it isn't anything physical... so it's all in our heads! Obviously my way of dealing with unhappiness is to get so confused that I can't remember what I'm sad about! It works too, until about two days later when I can't remember why I'm unhappy and why the cat is locked in the fridge. Ahh well, I'll just blame my brother and continue blissfully unaware *then about two days after that I'll go crazy* Oh, my brother's back from hospital which is cool. The phone will be jammed with all the calls though, and the tv will be playing non stop kiddy stuff *it's what happens to you when you're ill* I guess I'll just have to hide upstairs and revise. Have a nice day and try and stay upwind from the evil goth vibes. Peace, love and cheese cake *and hopefully someone will teach you how to spell and you won't be deluded by my bad use of english*
