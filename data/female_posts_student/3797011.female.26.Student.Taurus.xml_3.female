Although friends we may have in abundance,  True friends are quite special indeed;  As we feel quite akin to most others,  These fill, in us, a special need.   With true friends there is no sense of envy,  We accept them just as they are;  And ask nought but their love and respect,  But we never must take it too far.   No upset or hurt must be given,  For these things are evil indeed;  And all that we have we must offer,  To true friends whenever in need.   Nothing makes us accept them this way,  But our instinct, our issue of trust;  And our faithful acceptance of them,  As true people, honest and just.   We accept all their joys and their sorrows,    Their burdens we bear as our own;  A most powerful gift of support,  And comfort, to them, must be shown.   So treasure your many true friends,  Enfold them all in your love;  Enjoy them as never before,  With thanks for the help from above.     ~DreAmer NevER SLeeP~
