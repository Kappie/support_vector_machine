O_o She gives me evil looks, and always looks over my shoulder, like the devil is suddenly going to spawn from me or something. I really would care less, but she's my class adviser.. >_>  Gah. I know I promised myself I'd make this year count, blah blah blah. But you know me. It's back to my old tactics. n_n;; Gaaaaah. I suck. =P
