I have almost 900 dollars set away for my car, and I found a cute one but dad doesn't want me to rush it. Which I can understand, but its really cute and it kinda...hit me the right way I guess. Haha, but it hit him the wrong way:(. But we'll see. The right one will be there, that I'm sure of. I know I need a car by next year...and I'll have one!  Okay, I was wrong about writing a lot, figured out a few things I have to have done in less than an hour. I'll have to write more later! Bye!
