"go laaauuura, it's your biiiiiirthdaaaay!"  alas, i have never been and never will be the type to remain content. as the excitement wore off fifteen minutes after the call, it dawned on me that i had been over-modest in my celestial request. "more...MORE!" whispered the greedy monster from within. the more i thought about it, the more discontent i became with the idea of attending my backup for the next three years, knowing that it was my ABSOLUTE last choice. (okay, this is actually a false statement. i actually have four absolute last choices, all of which are located in california. come to think of it...i have two absolute first choices, both of which are very far from california, three regular first choices, still cross-continental, and two regular last choices, somewhere in the middle. to the untrained eye, this would appear to be the ranking system of a person who is more concerned with location than the actual school.) so as i was saying, "backup" quickly turned into "blech!" and i berated myself for having started my string of requests from the bottom up instead of from the top down. man, do i feel gypped.
