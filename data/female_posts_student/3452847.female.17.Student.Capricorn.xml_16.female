But it makes me feel down and i've realised that all the time i've had to put off feelings for Carlos has made me move on from him, and that yes i fancy him and hes a great mate but i don't think i could be in a relationship... Plus i still have issues with being hurt and shit and i feel bad enough him cheating on Ronnie with me..  I want to be with someone but i'm looking for the right person instead of just having fun which sucks. I just want a casual, happy relationship, with someone who i can care for and trust but someone i am not in love with and someone who is just nice. I wish i wasn't in **** with Jason, i don't even want to put his name and that word in the same sentence, i am trying to get rid of him, but i want to still be there. Caught up on a rollercoaster of emotions and i hate them and it and i must have no will power or anything to make myself hate the bloke, its why i have to be slightly mean and sarcastic, so i don't say anything else. But i swear he spoke about Laura and how he was used and the ignored on purpose? How he slept with her and then hoped they could get together and then she told him she was still caught up on Marc... I feel happy that she did that but when Tom told me they were just hugging etc afterwards like a couple and how much he liked it makes me feel worse, i can imagine it, i had images of them on the way home.   ~Lisa~
