By the way, I have a feeling that you're not much older than me mister! ha! am I right?            just kidding...I guess it's nice to know that someone "reads up" on this blog once in a while, especially when I have questions. Yes, I've tried talking to Him, then after a while I gave up and tried listening...but it feels like I still can't get through. I know it's most likely me who's letting  Him  down, but I don't know what else I'm supposed to do. I just went on a rock climbing trip with my youth group and during worship time at about midnight I would just look straight up and just  feel  His presence, but when I just waited it felt like it vanished. Yeah, I probably blame Him for a lot of stuff that He doesn't deserve to be blamed for (goodness gracious! You catch on to things far to quickly. Maybe I'm just hopelessly obvious or something...)I just have a ton of 'why' questions. I won't plague you with them butI do have anawful lot of them. Probably a huge reason that I've become so lostor whatever is that no one can answer my questions. Well, beside the Bible, but sometimes I want to ask questions that I already know the answers to. Do you know what I'm saying?     Thanks for answering my question, it really helps to know that pretty much the only person that reads this blog besides me has what seems to be a very good relationship with God. Maybe that's where I could begin to see His hand in my life again because out of the millions of people/blogson the internet, a Christian found my blog.    Sorry for talking so much but thanks. It helps to type things out.
