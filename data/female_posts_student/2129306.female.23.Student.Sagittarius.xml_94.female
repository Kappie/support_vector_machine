Second, the fact that Taco Bell in Springfield has reopened is both very, very good and very, very bad:  I have eaten dinner there 3 times out of the past 4 days-that is how much I have missed it (the nearest one to Springfield was 40 miles-so yeah).  This can be nothing but badness-the ten pounds I have lost are going to pile themselves back on-I MUST be strong...but their cheap chicken quesadillas and mild sauce OWN me!   Third, I LOVE SPRINGFIELD. This summer is going to be awesome.  :o)   Finally-I'm going to bed. G'night! More later...
