[Proverbs 4.23]  I have been thinking a great deal about the heart lately, specifically, my own heart.  I've been asking the question of where my heart is...what truly inhabits it?  I have to be honest in that tonight, you will find a whole lot of crap.  You see, I spent part of the evening venting about all the annoyances of this summer and for a small amount of time, it felt good.  Then something happened.  It's that thing that happens to all of us when we've realized how much crap came from inside us.  The other day, I sat with my grandmother.  She fell and broke her hip, so they had to replace a disk.  I held her hand while they were turning her to one side.  She squeezed it tight.  I looked down at her hand holding mine.  In that moment in time, God jolted me back to His "ultimate reality."  You see, my grandmother is this extraordinary woman.  She lost her mother at a young age, was adopted by her father's new wife, married, had thirteen children, was left by her husband to fend for herself and her children, and managed to live to the age of 86 with a legacy of her faith.  Out of her heart, came unto each of her children and grandchildren a sense of gratefulness.  Tonight, out of mine, came a sense of selfish pride and intolerance.  Every word continues to echo inside my mind as I try to hard to erase each item...  For some reason, God has decided to bring me to a place where I can sit with students and friends in their quest for Him.  I get the opportunity to listen to people's hearts.  What I'm learning is that out of that, He is also revealing to me the interworkings of my own.  It's not pretty, but He's working on it.  "Therefore we must understand that spiritual formation is not only formation of the Spirit or inner being of the individual, though that is both the process and the outcome.  It is also formation by the Spirit of God and by the spiritual riches of Christ's continuing incarnation in his people - including, most prominently, the treasures of his written and spoken word and the amazing personalities of those in whom he has most fully lived." [Dallas Willard,  Renovations of the Heart ]
