Is this really apathy or what? Have I lost my sense to react "properly" or am I just really dense? Why can't i even react prperly anymore? Why don't I find some things that are normally "surprising" not that surprising anymore? Is there something seriously wrong with my head?      Wahhhh!!! I don't want this to happen! And to think I still have class early tomorrow! How can i possibly smile with my head swimming with uncertainties like this? My head is going a mile a minute and I don't even understand why! I know something was supposed to happen, and yet nothing's happening. what am I waiting for? Why am I worried? Am I even really worried? Why don't I feel the tension of the upcoming exams when I haven't even studied a single paragraph? Why is this so complicated? Why do I keep asking? Why can't I stop asking? Why is it like this? What can I do? Why am I even here? What am i supposed to do? Am I doing it?!?!?      ARGH!!! So many questions, so little time... such a little head... so very few people who can help me at this point. Why can't I answer them on my own? Must I be so dependent upon others? And can anyone possibly understand mE??      Someone... please... help... this... confused mind... TT__TT
