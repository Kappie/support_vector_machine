He also bought a bass amp, which I want to watch him make love through. I guess I should be excited now. ;) Again something to look forward too. I guess he wouldn't invite me over if he really enjoy me. :D I guess my mood is looking up. However I should go vacuum my room and prepare for the grind. The faster it's over the sooner I see him, right? I wonder if he stayed the night at Sheila's...blah. I should go. I can't get started on this again.  I'll be back.
