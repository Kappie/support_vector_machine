So different with the life I had before.   I kind of like the things that I am doing now and life that I am live in now. I don't really like to stay late and do broing things. I guess I hadn't been myself for a while last year and now it's coming back.   Just hoping that I won't go back to before after this summer. I want try to live right. Not playing around and being like teenager.
