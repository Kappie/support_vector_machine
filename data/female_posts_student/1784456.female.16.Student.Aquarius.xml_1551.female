Blogger made me type in my password and i had forgotten it again, thank goodness i kept the email that told me it, how else am i meant to know that my password is laurasmells, only joking it's not really. I am going to Jens Laura and yes i will somehow copy Coyote Ugly, u may have to wait a few weeks though as dad is rather busy, and if i did it there would probably no longer be a copy to copy from!!!! I have been sat watching Hollyoaks this morning with rollers in my hair.  I know look like an olde world french girl!!!!  It looks better if they are tighter, am practising for the ball!!!! OMGOODNESS!!! Did u c popidol last nite, some of the blokes were well fit!!!  The girls were really good singers however.  My mates dumped/been dumped by her boyfriend not sure which yet. To KATIE if u come online before three today and read this do you want to share lifts to Jens if u r going??????? xx
