While the plan is fraught with potential problems, I personally like the plan for many reasons, particularly because it offers monetary incentive for great teaching ($5,000 raise). This measure is breakthrough because according to Kerry, it begins 'paying teachers like the professionals they are." Unlike other professions, teachers are often not considered well-trained professionals that constantly learn and improve. Instead, tenure track teachers ease into comfort and lax methods. More on this later.
