Me and Lauren made jokes about small feet and guys.  it was really amusing.  We also thought of the most perfect all male cast for a movie.  There were alot of winners.  More news on the short pale blonde kid, contrary to what we thought at lunch we later discovered that he was NOT WEARING white socks with slip on sandals.  But he was wearing the ugly jacket AND a dirty white shirt.  But his jeans were nice.  I hope a braver girl than i chooses to tell this kid the problems with his wardrobe......but until then Me and Lauren will discuss his clothing flaws, lol!   Can't wait until the Coppell vs. Jesuit game, it'll be awesome!!!!  Emily (my friend from the Stars games) is coming and this time she'll have to represent for Coppell!   She bet me $100 bucks the other day that i would marry a Niko Kapanen look-alike on an ice rink and name my first kid Niko.  It was really funny.  hmmm i really have nothing else to say...  4 days until the stars game with Britty and Jess AND 3 days until the Coppell vs. Jesuit game!!!!!!!!  Whats that cheer we like to hear? Go Niko go Niko go! (or you could put Dallas in there.....whatever.)  Cheers, ~~~Taylor~~~
