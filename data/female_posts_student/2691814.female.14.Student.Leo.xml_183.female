But I stayed there till 12 and then went home and i watched Degrassi. Now thats what i call a good date, i mean besides the fact that that dude marco had some problems and his dad, omg, how rude can a person be?! But when i saw marco and dylan kiss i was like...OMG!! lol it was cool.  I'm really tired...ok heres another funny moment: When me and francesca were on the bus and we were talking about something and that kayla girl...the ugly bottle blonde..just all of the sudden said *im a wigger* I about died when she said that to us...and the look me and franny gave eachother was priceless! theres some funny shizz.
