I was cleaning out my closet, flipping through old year books from middle school, and thinking how unfortunate that I didn't get to go to highschool with the people I grew up with. Or grow up with the people I went to High School with. Not that my friends in here aren't great, in fact they're wonderful, and I'm blessed to know most of them, but I don't have that history that they have. Its sad (but necessary) to see your old best friends move on and make new ones.  Even though you've done the same. People always say they'll keep in touch, but its never like it was.  (Sorry Tom I miss you hun, and we all think of you and wonder what you're doing) Its annoying though, to make the transition in the middle of high school. Once in awhile (these times are far and few between) when I go back and look at old memories I feel like I'm straddling two lives, one in Gurnee and one in Naperville. My past is there, and my present here, and who knows where the heck my future is? For all those who were the new kid at one point, you know what I'm talking about. Most of the time it doesn't bother me, but now and again I wonder what if.  What if my dad hadn't have gotten transferred? What if I had gone to Carmel or Warren? Who would my friends have been? Would I have turned out as a different person? What if we had moved into another school district? What if what if what if. All these doubts. And then I remember. Life in Naperville aint that bad. My school is fun, my problems workable, my friends and family--always interesting. And the memories?  Irreplaceable.
