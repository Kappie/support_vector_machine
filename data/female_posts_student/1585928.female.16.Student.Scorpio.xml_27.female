I'm a failure right Julie??!..ah well I try!.. lets see what I did this weekend... well Friday I skipped school, and went with Elizabeth to the Fairgrounds for her Show! we were there at like 9 in the morning and left at like 7 or 8 that night! it was a very long day but it was funn!!... we met A TON of HOTTTT guys, haha! then I started feeling like total crap! and we got to her house and I thought I was gonna die! I got NO sleep!, Then Saturday... yea ..it sucked too! i slept and layed around all day. and Elizabeth came by that night and I was asleep, but she basically lives at my house anyways, so when I woke up we watched a movie!, then.. we went to sleep! and Sunday I felt a lotttt better!! I don't know what was wrong with me in the first place, but anyways... so me and Eliz went back up to the shows Sunday and saw everyone from Friday, and ohh how could I forget...... I meT JOSH!!!... oh what a sweetheart!! i barely know him and love the kid already!... I get to see him this weekend!! *YaY!!* ... but anyways... yesterday was interesting.. I had this history report to print, but I guess it was just the day for EVERYONE's printer to be messed up!... but finally me and Julie talked to Baker, who has a working printer and said we could come over and use it! so we get over there and what do ya know... the floppy disc is screwed up!!! so it doesn't work!, and i spent 10 valuable minutes plagerizing that thing the night before (haha Michael and Julie) .. so later we go to nick's and re-plagerize a whole new report and save it to a different disc (couldn't print it..cause his printer is screwed up too) and finally get done with that damn report!. I ended up printing it at school today... haha but anyways... I don't know what else to write about, but Julie said this blog had to be long, since I haven't written one in forever!...so let me think... ok... I thought of something.... Me and Stephen are.. I guess you would say fighting *AgAiN*. whats new though?.. I swear me and him fight more than any two people i know!.. It started because He called me Friday night at about 5 and I was with Elizabeth in Jackson, and he was like 'I was just calling to tell you that I'm about to go to the mall with my brothers!' and I was like 'aight!'.. no big ya know.. so he calls Saturday while I was asleep, and I told him i had to go and to call me later!, well he didn't call until Sunday and I was with eLizabeth at her show thing.. and he was like 'well I guess your feeling better?' and I was like 'yes, actually I am', and then Brian(a guy we were playing pool with at the time) takes the phone from me and starts talkin to him, and I finally get back on the phone and Stephen is all in a pissy mood.. but I talked to him for a few more minutes.. and I asked him what he did this weekend and he said 'oh some 'people' spent the night' and I was like 'oh, ok, who?' and he started naming people (girls and boys) and it was all good until he said a certain someone's name! and I was like oh really????, well uh... I'll let you go! and he HUNG UP!!!! yea... He had the nerve to hang up on me!!, so I called him back up and I was like what are you thinking?, and he was like 'you didn't even ask if anything happened between me and 'that certain person'.. and i was like 'yea i know I don't even want to know!', and he was like 'brittany, don't start with me, this is not a good day'...blah, blah, blah... and I haven't spoken to him since then! so thats that!... oh well!.. i dunno... it'll be aight!... well I hope this is long enough for you Julie, cause I have absolutly nothing else to say! I'm gone to watch the rest of Dr. Phil! haha Michael!~:.:.:-holla-!:.:.:
