So apparently there is this show on TV now called American something or other because all of these stupid shows  have  to be american, [not including Canadian Idol which was a total replica of American Idol.] Anyway, so this show is exactly like American Idol,  again , except this time theyre chosing the WORST singers.  I tell you, these people need to start coming up for new ideas for television shows. Plus, whats even worse it that they are encouraging these people to "sing" and carry on as if they can. The only person on it that I saw was this guy who was definetly gay, singing something by destinys child or something and was wearing half a shirt. Honestly people, this is not normal entertainment. Im very sorry to say that I had just eating when I saw this "Superstar" at work. My stomache was not the same after that. Plus think about how these people will feel after the judges tell them theyre awesome and then when they pick the worst one?? Can you spell suicide? Chances are, people that go on shows like this thinking theyre awesome have been tormented their whole lives and think this is some kind of miricle. And thats why I think this American show is disgusting. What ever happened to humanity? I guess Racism, Discrimination and just making fun of your own kind  is  the new pink, Brad.  Anyway thats enough ranting for me. Im looking at semi pictures trying to find some with me in them and no success so far, which is awesome :S thank you Jessica. Oh, theres one.
