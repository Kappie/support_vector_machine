I mean its tough to play the guitar as well as sing and that too a Bryan Adams number. Well, in this respect I think the Strings number, Sar Ki Ye Pahaar is marvellous (the guitarist sings the song as well).   Yes, I bunked the March Past to see the assembly (well Hema Jain mam is their class teacher and i wanted to kno what she was going to put up). And even Princi declared her as the Most Charming techer in the senior classes. Anyhow, Nisheeth please do not blabber in Physics about my voice. We get enough of it from Mrs. Shobhaa Mehta, who has perfected the art of making her students go to sleep. And unfortunately, my voiceHAS revived.  I am going for an eye check up in the afternoon. (yup, my vision is blurred, half the times cannot make out what the teacher writes on the blackboard in school as well as in Fiitjee.)  Will write about it when I come back.
