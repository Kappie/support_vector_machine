Came home with 2 new bras, a new pair of underwear, 4 shirts, new PJs for mom, oh and some shorts for ben and a sundress for me!=) ah I love shopping with my mom when she's in a good mood! And today when we went back to Kohl's quick cause Ginny needed to pick some things up for Michael, she bought me a three pack of toe rings! ((since my feet/toes look oh-so-cute!)) ha that was fun of course!          I really love that  Boy Meets World  is on again!
