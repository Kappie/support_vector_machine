So anyways, we had chicken fights and we jumped and splashed and i must say it was the BEST day ever! I met new people and had tons of fun.I got flipped over like 5 million times by people and it was SOO cool.The only bad thing was getting a tan on my face =P It got a little red but the redness is going away...its funny.I scrunch up my nose and i get a little tingly feeling in my eyebrow cause of the tan! Hehehe.As long as mt face doesnt peel  o_O  Very scary.I wanna get my back tanned.Im scared ill fall asleep in the sun XD My sister did.. Hahaha.Red back.Cute.Hey... how come some ppls backs and fronts go a nice golden tan but so go red =P For example, my moms front and back is so red that it can blind you.But my back and front goes tanned. (Except my face.My face needs sunscreen.) Well.I cant wait to go swimming tomorrow with my friends.I know its gonna be another fun day.Today i didnt get to go though cause of my mom.. (Wanted me to stay home for no reason) But im pretty sure she'll let me go tomorrow.If i dont, ill be very mad >.>
