I'll try again tomorrow though.  Ummm, I did something kind of stupid though. I just went into Mr. Silder's office to talk to him about IMEA, and I ended up signing up. This isn't cool at all because I get nervous for school auditions. Just think...argh. Why are there so many good trumpet players? I had to go to my locker really quickly during study hall for drivers ed. and I hear Peter playing and I'm just like, "Stop being good!!" So, yeah, anyway now I can flip out at IMEA. Oh yay.   I'm pretty sure I failed the Satire and Comedy test. I wrote the shortest essays. I'm just like, "people are bad because they're obsessive and nerotic." I didn't really say nerotic, but I thought it. Oh well. Such is life. I think I'm going to go do some...I don't know...homework? Nah. Too non-procrastinator'ish. Ya like that made up word? Yeah....that's always fun, making up words...especially on satire and comedy tests...
