Yet I noticed as I was watching it that all of my observations concerning it were...well, silly to say the least.  For example:  I noted that the wardrobe for the show must be really easy, since the entire season takes place all in one day and nobody will be changing clothes that often.  Never mind the fact that these people are dealing with concerns of life and death and clothes are the last thing on their mind.  But I sure am thinking about it.    Wish I could remember more of my keen and witty insights.  I was watching it alone, so I didn't have anyone to share them with, so I am reporting them now.  Tonight is "The West Wing" Christmas episode, so tomorrow I should have further inane things to report.  So stay tuned.
