FUCK ( scuse the language) Well Tom has gone to a hot country, but unfortuantly i cant remeber which one. I actually asked tom to write where he was going and what he woz gonna do but he obviousoly couldnt be bothered. Well i went to my cousins yesterday, they live in Oxted and have a mahoosive house and garden. I love it. Btw Jo one of my cousins is gonna be in the upper 6th at Oxted. Jo i will wear themed clothing if that is what you wish foir, although that will mean i will need to  go on another shopping trip into Croydon.... Thats not a bad thing though :) Have any of you been invited to a party at Goff's house on the Saturday? ( day after Helen and Pennies) I have been invited but i dont want to go if no one is gonna go ! Oh yea, i still cant work out how you get pictures on here, its too confusing Well that is it from me - The wisdom woman, farwell and goodbye
