My session is from 7.25-9.55 every day at LC. Apparently, there are no buses that run to my neighborhood  at all.   The closest one goes to Forest Glen. Now, technically, I could walk to 5 miles from Forest Glen to my house on a busy road with a blind curve. Right? Oh, but here's the other thing, the buses don't leave LC until 12.30! So, I have to wait at LC for another 2.5 hours to get a bus to walk about 5 miles. Don't even ask if we called transportation. We did. That's who told us this. I hate this township. With a passion. So, I have no clue what I am going to do. What might end up happening is that I quit summer school and take night school FOR GYM. Do you know how stupid this is??? It's a GYM credit!!! Heck, it's not even worth a full credit! It's only .5 of a credit!!!! But, no, I can't graduate highschool unless I have two semesters of gym. GYM! Oh argh. I'm doomed. Oh, and yes, I called my consel. She wasn't there, so I left a voice mail message.   "Don't worry. There's more birds in the sea. Wait! I mean, fish in the sky..."
