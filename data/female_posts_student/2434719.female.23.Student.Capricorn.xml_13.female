MONSTER. i had never heard of it (i havn't heard of ANY movies... that's what happens when you don't watch tv and cnn.com or the onion doesn't cover it).... good god. boy was i in for a surprise.  it sure wasn't cuban dancing, i'll tell you that much.  oh and i can't beleive i'm about to write about this... but i was randomly trying on this dress i have... (ken, we bought it together... the black one with the thing beige straps?) anyways, YEAH MY BOOBS HAVE SHRANK. i'm sorry to share this but it's such a weird feeling.... the kids held up the dress! they made the dress! NOTHIN. i don't even know if i can wear it anymore :(  it's a sad sad day for me... i just want to wear the dress damn it. maybe a strapless pushup or something. some toilet paper... but it's not even that, its the sides, they're gaping out at the bust.  cuase my chest is gone!   i'm sorry i just had to get that off my shrinking chest.  ha ha ha i loved that scentence.  okay so i didn't write ANY of my paper today. i did print stuff off? but i forgot to pick up my books from the library so that's not a good start.. i have to re-find them all tomorrow and we all know how that's gonna happen. :)  SPRING BREAK 2004! YEAH!  later goats.
