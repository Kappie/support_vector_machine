One from Sarah - Hey how are you? You out this weekend?   Ok, so you might think that that was somewhat promising, bearing in mind that Sarah almost NEVER texts me first. And then two texts later, after inviting me out, she tells me that, actually, she's going to Blackpool with Nikki this weekend. Riiiiight. So, what do I think? Is she just bored at college? I think so. Damn. Anyway, can't think too hard, not awake.  x
