Rounded out the Pleadings flashcards around 930 and paused enjoy some fresh brownies and Dreyers Andes Mint Ice Cream; somehow, we can't seem to get going again.    Got scared around 3.  The exam was less than 24 hours away and I still didn't have a handle on joinder, despite the intense study of the subject yesterday.  Granted, I had other things on my mind (like the significantly reduced amount of hair on it), but still.  A wasted day never feels good, especially the day following it, particularly when that day is the one before an exam.    So yea, winding down...the mind is turning to mush and that's as good a reason to call it a night as any.  Soon it will be time for Torts, the grand finale.  Good thing it's only a two hour exam.  Feels like we've been in finals mode for a month.  Studying for Property is a distant memory.  We're discussing the propositioning of ourselves for the questions to the Civil Procedure exam.  Could get interesting...
