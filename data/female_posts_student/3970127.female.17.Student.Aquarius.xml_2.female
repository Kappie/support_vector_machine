Thing is, the way it happened, it made the Christian sound horrible. It made Christianity look like a prison...and this is the image that everyone gets of Christianity. :(. It frustrated me SO much. Also, at  urlLink school  I'm so not open about my faith...I don't know if its because I'm worried what  urlLink people  will think of me, of if its just because God is such a taboo word at  urlLink school  ? hmmmmm
