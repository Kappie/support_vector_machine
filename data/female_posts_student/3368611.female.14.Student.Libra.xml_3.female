I have all my credits except for one in Social Studies, but it's the teacher's fault, not mine. In other words, I'm going to the 10th grade, can I get a jalapeno (hallelujah)?   Summer prospects are blurry. At first I wanted to work at the  ABC Day Camp , but who REALLY wants to spend their summer running behind, dealing with, and yelling at a bunch of little kids?  I DO THAT AT CHURCH.  I'm thinking of an internship at the  Claremont Riding Academy  where I used to take horseback riding lessons. I love it there, the smell, the atmosphere, the horses. Even if I don't get paid, it'll be fun! Money's important, but it's not the ONLY thing... I think. LOL. Anywayz, if Claremont doesn't work out, I'll find something else. Like maybe I can tutor kids on certain days. Yeah, that'd be okay. I can tutor in... math. Math and  maybe  science.   Dad said that I don't have to do someting EVERYDAY just I can't be in the house doing nothing but rotting my brain on TV, phone, and computer all summer. Well, he didn't say exactly THAT, but I know that it's what he meant.   Ooh!! I know what I want to do if I work at Claremont!! I want to take care of the horses! Brushing them and feeding them and cleaning up... well, the cleaning up after them part isn't so exciting, but just being around them!!     Okay, enough play. Lunch is almost over. Be Back Later....
