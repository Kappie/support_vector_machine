I had thought that this would be a great opportunity to really grow in my faith. This has been quite the opposite. I haven't spent a lot of time reading the word or in prayer. My best friend helped me to pinpoint why and gave me a few suggestions. I also do a bible study with one of the advisors here and she also helped me to pinpoint some problems. She also gave me some ideas to help me to overcome my weakened state of Faith. I learned that life without discipline is chaotic. I also learned that as far away from Jesus that I might be is has never left my side. I am so thankful that I live in an environmen that is so understanding and can help me to get back on track before I lose way. I am also thankful that the Lord has given me such good friends that I can turn to in a time of need. I have learned that God 's faith will always be here. I trust the Lord with all of my heart and know in my heart that whatever I am going through he will still love me. Jesus died on the cross for my sins and yours. He loves you that much. If you don't know Jesus as your Savior please ask someone about his love for you.
