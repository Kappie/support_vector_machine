But a thought that came to my mind sometime today, was how important relationships our. But why? "God made us for that" I think theres more then that. I dont know, something i was just thinking about, maybe i'm sillyness... My sister and i are reading out of Isaiah right now, and last night she read 5, and i liked it. At frist i hated the fact that she was reading slower, but it helped. Once you slow down with something, you are able to bust out your thinking skills even more. But we read something that touced my heart. for some reason. But before i leave with the verses and stuff i want to tell yal' that its a weird chapter, but a true one. Well not weird. Its about what is, and has gone on with God. So sad we have been a disapointment to him. He wanted us to be sweet, beautiful, wonderful and [pleaseing but something happend to his group of peoples.  1Now I will sing a song for the one I love about his vineyard:      My beloved has a vineyard         on a rich and fertile hill. 2     He plowed the land, cleared its stones,         and planted it with choice vines.     In the middle he built a watchtower         and carved a winepress in the nearby rocks.     Then he waited for a harvest of sweet grapes,         but the grapes that grew were wild and sour. 3     "Now, you people of Jerusalem and Judah,         you have heard the case; you be the judges. 4     What more could I have done         to cultivate a rich harvest?     Why did my vineyard give me wild grapes         when I expected sweet ones? 5     Now this is what I am going to do to my vineyard:     I will tear down its fences         and let it be destroyed.     I will break down its walls         and let the animals trample it. 6     I will make it a wild place.         I will not prune the vines or hoe the ground.         I will let it be overgrown with briers and thorns.     I will command the clouds         to drop no more rain on it." 7     This is the story of the LORD's people.         They are the vineyard of the LORD Almighty.         Israel and Judah are his pleasant garden.     He expected them to yield a crop of justice,         but instead he found bloodshed.     He expected to find righteousness,         but instead he heard cries of oppression.
