    
       Thank you for the most amazing high school years I could have ever dreamed of. You were beside me through them thick and thin, even when I wasn't always for you.  Thank you for the laughs, the consultory laughs, the ones that made me just about die because they were so funny! (me falling in an ice cold lake)  Thank you for sharing your opinions about God, love, and people. Thank you for your confidence in me.  Thank you for being with me when I found who I really am.  Thank you for hide and go seek at Walmart. Thank you for the retreat and 'SAVE A HORSE, RIDE A COWBOY, WHAT WHAT!" Thank you for the tears we shared and being able to overcome so many large obstacles. Thank you Thank you Thank you! Thanks for putting up with goo's randomness, for sharing my life.  You will never know how much it has meant.  When us seniors are all gone throw a party, join together, have a great time, and LAUGH!  I LOVE YOU ALL, i can never tell you that enough. If you need anything, know that you can email me, post it on here and i will be praying for you.   its not the end, its a beautiful beginning, good luck in the upcoming year!
