Few days pass without you, then a little less than a year Vaguely I remember your face, still wondering why you are not here Say you can’t be here anymore Drugged you’re lying here on the floor Unmoving but I know you’re alive Forever I know that you will thrive Then I realize your body is cold Did the real story completely unfold? Thought you didn’t have the strength to do the deed When it finally came around I’m now watching you bleed
