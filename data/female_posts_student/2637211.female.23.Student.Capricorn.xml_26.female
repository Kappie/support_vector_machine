Is this how Madonna...er, Esther, is making is clear that she's old? I mean, she is old enough to be my mother (they're the same age), but you don't see my mom embracing matronhood like this. That's my theory: Modonna's trying to make the shift to old lady easier by adopting an old lady name. Esther isn't your grandma's rock star.
