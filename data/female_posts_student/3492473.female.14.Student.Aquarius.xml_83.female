I'll admit it, I was being whiney and bitchy because I was nervous to go get my foot checked out. It's not like I was snapping at my mom or sis. My mom was actually the one who snapped at me so then I got super quiet and pouty. But Margaret was in a good mood so she was being a bitch to me and making fun of me and everything immature you could imagine! So we went to the bank and grocery shopping so I was having a  blast.  After that, we headed up to the high school. The football team had their doubles. I had to go inside to talk to the sports doctor. Her name was Jen. Jen was helping one of my brother's friends who hurt his neck or shoulders just before in pratice and then we went back outside to the field so we could talk about my foot. I explained what happened, how it happened, what hurt, and so on. She put pressure on different parts of my foot and asked me if any of them hurt. The only part that really hurt was the part coming down from the toe next to my big toe. I'm not sure what it's called. Jen told me nothing was broken or sprained or fractured but I probably  bruised the bone.  So she gave me a patch, wrap, and tape for my foot. She also told me to ice it before and after practice, to not walk on it much, to not tighten my laces so much, and to always put up my ankle. I did ice it before and after practice but I have to walk, I can't help it. I don'e like not being able to get up. I laced my cleats a little less tight but I still can't help that either. I like to make sure their on and they don't come undone. About putting my ankle up, well, it worked for a little bit of today. Other than that, I've had my ankle down. Ah, this is difficult. I wish it was easier.  I wish my foot was okay to begin with.  So then we went home and I turned on the computer because I wanted to make a quick little post about my foot. But Margaret was like, "Please can I just go on for two minutes to check something about my bank?" I  baby her. That's what I do.  I said yes.  Forty  minutes later, I read some Tom Sawyer and began to doze off on my bed as Margaret continued to play on the computer. Ah! She's pissing me off. So then we went to Target. I love that store. I really needed to go bra shopping so that's what I was doing. OMG!  I got two sports bras!  Typical for the rest of you girls but I don't do sports bras. Well, I do now. Let me tell you one thing: Running a mile in soccer with your period (my boobs hurt like fuck then), is just  hell.  They just bounce everywhere. Other than that, normal bras work fine for me but the bras I got are really comfy so I'm happy. And another thing. Sports bras flatten my boobs. (sad face) I don't like that. I ended up getting another bra. It was some 5-way bra because I really needed a strapless one since I'm always stealing Margaret's. I also got a pair of white ( !! ) shorts, black, white, and blue flip flops, and hair bands. So yeah that was really exciting. But the funniest thing was I was looking at something and I go to find my mom and Margaret. If you didn't know or forgot, Margaret is  23.  She acts like a two year though. I'm not even joking. She always says how  I'm  the one who acts like the big sis, not her. So I find my mom and guess what I see?  Margaret is sitting in the cart.  Yes. In the cart. I took a picture of it too. I always carry my camera, don't ask. So she sat in there the whole time and was acting very childish. But at least this was just a show. So we came home and no surprise, that girl ran to the computer. I mean, come on, I'm 14 and have no life. She's 23, she has a life. Doesn't she have anything better to do than sit around online all day? I read some more Tom Sawyer and cleaned a little and did some crunches. So I finally got online because my mom and Maggie left to go get something. But as soon as they get back, Marge begins t fight w/ me because her internet boyfriend IMed her and I didn't want her to go on the computer. So I made the mistake of letting her type whatever to him as she just sat next to me. Let's just say, I saw  a lot  of things I didn't wanna. Then I had a few interesting conversations. One is a lot more upsetting than the other because it really does mess with my head and the other one is just fucked up.  Now, I'm super confused and upset and worried and I don't know how to handle either one.  Well, I sorta just came up with a solution to the fucked up one but it's more of an excuse not a solution. So I was pretty much crying over those two things. I got ready for soccer. Yes, I iced my foot. I bandaged it all up which made it a little difficult to walk and run. So I go to soccer. I knew I had to watch myself but  I'm  very  stubborn.  I'm play through the pain. Even if I'm ready to die. I will. That's just how I am. I don't like giving in to pain. I was waiting to talk to Mr. Willis when Steve comes up to me and  smacks my butt and says "good game"  and I just laugh and say thanks. Later, he was rubbing my shoulders for a minute, he's cool. He's funny so he makes the running easier. It was alright. My breathing was cool. It was my foot slowing me down this time. We did three on a ball and then we did trapping drills. My one was  really  good so I was proud of myself. Then we did trapping with another person so one person takes the ball and the other defends or "contains" them. The first one me and Nicole did was  really  good! But then the next one, I tripped in a whole and scratched Nicole. What can I say?  We have crappy fields.  Then the next one, she went to switch sides while I was trying to contain her and she hit my hand and my inhaler went flying. I didn't know whether to keep going or get the inhaler but I decided to top and find my inhaler because I didn't wanna lose it, ya know? Then we did some flag, square, and kill drills. Those weren't that bad. Overall the main problems of the day were my foot and the field. The grass is super high and there are holes  everywhere.  But I guess it prepares us for situations like this ya know? I felt like I did a good job. Then we went to go hand out uniforms in the locker room. I asked for 13 and got it! I was soo happy!  13 is my number!  But then we were handing out the away jersey's and the coach didn't call 13. So I was like WTF? In the end there wasn't an away jersery with a 13 so I had to switch numbers. I ended up picking...number 1!!  I'm number 1!!  Lol! I can walk around and say that and know that I am! I guess it was good that I got 1 because 13 was an extra large and 1 was a medium. My shorts are a large so that's cool. But the socks I got...well, let's just say, I need to get other ones because my calves are too big for them. Then I came home and ate and watched TV.  Good luck to everyone with volleyball try outs tomorrow.  OMG! By the way, my brother went on a date tonight! Awww... LOl! I don't know the girl. She went to South. I think she graduated this summer. But my mom said she's really pretty and sweet. So that's good. Ah, I'm freaking out. I wanna get my cartilage pierced again now! Or my belly button! But I have to wait to get my cartilage til after soccer and I think I'm getting my belly button for my 15th birthday. Maybe. Oh well. I'm really tired and I gotta wake up around 10. So I'll talk to you later. Sorry no times for poems lately. Soon I promise!  I'm just praying my foot gets better really soon...       By the way the song "Somebody Told Me" by the Killers is awesome! I'm totally in love with it.
