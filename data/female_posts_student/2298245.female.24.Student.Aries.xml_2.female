Well, me and the rest of the crowd here at St. John's University School of Law.  Around this time of year, the tension in the library really picks up; it is palpable as soon as one enters the building.  It's hard to handle at times, but since I'm a veteran compared to the poor 1Ls who are getting ready for their first law school exams ever, I think that it isn't as bad for me.  It isn't a matter of knowing whehter I can succeed anymore.  Instead, it is a matter of endurance.  I just hope I can make it to the end.  And today, I feel like I can.
