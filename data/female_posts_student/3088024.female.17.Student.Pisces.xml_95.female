My co-blogger (and I won't mention any names for privacy sake) is starting to develope early stages of domestic violence/condecending attitude/uncoltrolled temper/feirce rage without instigation/adult male immaturity. On top of that, he eats too much. Example:  Jcarlos287: why do you threaten me so? triquetta16: i dont recall threating triquetta16: i recollect an imperative command  and later...  triquetta16: i want something to read Jcarlos287: grab one of those ten pound books you love triquetta16: *grabs book* triquetta16: *throws at jenna* triquetta16: *walks away*   Can we help him? Or is it too late... We need massive amounts of time to change his entire personality and put him on a diet. Is this even possible though...I dunno. He loves his PIE. This is too much for me to deal with right now...please help. **leaves**
