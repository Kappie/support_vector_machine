Having more knowledge and being in a class that strictly looks at the MMPI, I'm able to analyze my results more.  There's nothing more exciting for me than to take an indepth look and analyze myself!   My score resulted in a high scale 4, which is psychopathic deviate, and pretty much a normal range of scores for the other 9 scales. Apparantly others that also score high on scale 4 are criminals, psychologists, and pastors.  It's great being in the same category as criminals.  Basically the three groups all utilize their empathy to connect with others, but the reasoning is different.  Criminals do so to manipulate others while psychologists do so to help others.  Yeah, yeah whatever I can say to make myself sound better.  I know what you're thinking!  My scores also depicted a person that was gregarious, outgoing, and needed to be around others.  Also a person that does not tolerate boredom well, does not feel the need to be precise or double check things, is trusting.  It even made a hypothesis about my relationships.  I can't remember all it said as I don't have my book, but when I get home I'll post an entry all about myself!  I plan to take the test again as it's been over a year. I just wish I could take a test to depict what my cognitive abilities are.   I suppose I could, but I doubt they'd be accurate as I've given the tests before and know the answers.
