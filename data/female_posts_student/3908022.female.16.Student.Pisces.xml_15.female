It usually gives me a feeling of completeness for a very short while, which usually makes me forget about my problems for a very short while. Today, it didn't. On one hand, that might be because I didn't actually shop. I ordered. But still. And, plus, I ordered shoes that won't go with a lot of my clothes so now I have to buy clothes to go with the shoes I just bought. Which means that I have to spend more of the money that I've earned. Which I do not want to do. Yesterday I got the pearl necklace from my grandmother. It turns out that that necklace is worth like $400! I'm a little freaked out about that... I don't have any necklace that expensive. (Which proves that I'm not rich...) And I have no idea when to wear it.. :S  One of the things cheering me up, though, is reading all the amazing stories at:  urlLink http://trory.de-nile.net  They are great.!!!  And my Uggs are out of stock!!!!! :'( I'm so bummed about that. But they've been out of stock before, so hopefully they'll come back again.  Over- and - out.
