If I can't enjoy the ability to create I will enjoy the ability to admire and admire I love to do so fuck you God I am special too!  (no offence God, please don't send your rath upon me - lol)  anyway I must be off, just heard the kettle boil, now to watch Practical Magic with a lovely cuppa, hmmmmm a great day me thinks  See You Soon XxXxXxX
