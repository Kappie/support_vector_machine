Well I guess I should start off by saying Happy 4th! Thank you to all who protect us everyday...being in the military family now makes me open my eyes more and realize what it takes to make sacrifices. Hope your day is going well... I have ups and downs about today but push through like any other day.   Perhaps I should introduce myself to those who do not know me. My name is Rachel I'm  23 years old, into punk music, alt music, some 80's music, Detroit tigers baseball, and UofM football. My sweetie is in Iraq right now in the Army's 1st cav out of Fort Hood in Texas. He is a mechanic and I couldn't be any prouder of his accomplishments and what he has done for himself. I'm currently living with my family in Michigan while he is deployed.  You will see me talk about him a lot since that is all that is going on in my life right now. Also this will serve as a journal to him to see how I am doing while he is gone. To cap it all off I try to stay busy by finishing up my dental assisting degree and I am 6 months away from getting it. That's about all that's interesting or worth talking about right now.    I'm pretty excited about today because Rob getting his combat patch sown on. I know he has been waiting even before he went over there to get one. It's what most military guys dream of. I just talked to him a few minutes ago on yahoo messenger and he is a bit tired from pulling a 14 hour guard duty but that's all I seemed to really get out of him. I'm used to it though cause it's pretty strenuous over there.     I don't know if I will be going to the fireworks tonight. In my town we have this huge festival called the cherry festival.. And it's just that.. All about cherries. There are tons of people here.. More then you would ever want to come in contact with in a town this size. There's a few good movies on tonight so maybe I will just stay in and catch those. There's nothing like a good 80's movie like The Karate Kid or Top Gun. The only thing that would make this day better is Peewees Big Adventure after those 2 movies... I don't care what anyone says... peewee herman is my favorite still... All guys do what he did.. He just got caught and that's sad! heh. ahhh the good ole' days... How I miss them... Well welcome to my blog if after my peewee herman confession you are still interested to read!
