I didnt get to sleep till like 4am and am quite shattered so am posting on here then back to bed. I am going to work on some of my school work at some stage but also have to pack my bags as i am going back to dads tonight.  It is raining here and am rather glad I cna stay home inside and in bed while it rains it is just so neat. :-) You think I'm wierd?  I think I sorted things out with Ed last night, I am unsure but I know kinda what I need to work on limiting, I got answers to most of my questions after talking with andre then talking to Ed. I have a question for everyone out there that reads this blog,    why do we as humans always ASSUME we know everything about everything and everyone?????            Crap I broke the writing!lol. well I think that is about it, my neck and throat are extremely sore today and i dont know why.      Well I will write again soonish.   cya    Peace
