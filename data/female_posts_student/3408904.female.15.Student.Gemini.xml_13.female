Sad to say, our teachers pressurised we sec 3s as our standard drops after they left... What to do? I felt so stressed when I return back to band.. Wtf? Me, a section leader who always kena scolding =| I really wish that sum sec 4s come back loh.. Need their help so much.. Well, it's time for us to learn the ropes and be independent afterall.. Sad to know, they cant be always there for us.. Cause they need to do their 'O' level stuff.. It was like very stressed for them as they are the first batch for my school, bringing in fame and glory.. (Hope So!^_^) Sian Sian Sian, next week focused test all come.. Wtf?!
