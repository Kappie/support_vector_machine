I have a coupla things I can update ya'll on. My life was once again hectic this week, and if you don't know why- then come forward and let me smack the crap out of you! The biggest stress-ant at the moment is of course the Prom. I decided to ask a friend to come along, but, tres sad, he couldn't make it because of "family buisness". What? Yea, I didn't really understand either, but that's aight. I got a prom date for next year the same night the dude I asked said he couldn't make it. What? Lol, yea, it was pretty awesome if I say so myself. I betcha'll will never guess who it is...  And that puts my secret count up to 3  3 secrets all at once, man, aren't I just the lil sneaky one? Muahahaha. I wield the power of the secrets. Now, down to buisness.   I was supposed to write a song.  About california tim's car. Which I haven't started writing yet. Carmen will like that lol. She feels that she is the gifted one. Well- I give her props, because, she is gifted. But, I'm talented too.. so we shall see. Look for that song, and her's, cause I am gonna post them both on here one day soon....
