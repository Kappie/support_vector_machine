So, it is a work in progress, but here are the lyrics to the best song ever.  Sugar High.  The only thing is, there are two versions.  A)  Soundtrack version  [persumably the real version] and B)  Movie version  [featuring none other than Renee Zellewager as Gina].  The movie version has been cleaned up a little for artistic purposes.  So, here they are.  Go download it and sing along kids.   Artist:  Coyote Shivers feat Renee Zellewager  Song:  Sugarhigh (Film Version)  they all said life's just a bowl of cherries, but sometimes it seems like anything but think again sometimes reputations outlive their applications sometimes fires don't go out when you're done playing with them I feel so funny deep inside I wanna kiss myself goodbye  sugarhigh.. gotta have it really need it to get by sugarhigh.. wanna feel it can't conceal it sugarhigh  I could go out and not even leave the house a TV set and a bottle of wine's, just fine crashing out on that old pull out couch watching saturday night live I guess that's why when I think about my life I wanna kiss myself goodbye  sugarhigh  gotta have it really need it to get by sugarhigh...  alright, [guitar solo]  I... far and wide I've explored the deepest caverns of my mind to try and find an explanation why I get this funny feeling deep inside when I think about my life I wanna kiss myself goodbye  sugarhigh.. gotta have it really need it to get by sugarhigh.. I wanna feel it can't conceal it makes me high sugarhigh.. need it now I've got to live until I die sugarhigh.. can you feel it, can you feel it sugarhigh _____________________________________________   Artist:  Coyote Shivers   Song:  Sugarhigh (Soundtrack Version)  they all said "she's just another groupie slut" and I said I thought you were anything but  think again, sometimes reputations outlive their applications  and sometimes fires don't go out, when you're done playing with them I feel so funny deep inside  when you kiss me goodbye   sugarhigh.....sugarhigh  we could go out and not even leave the house  a t.v. set and a bottle of wine is just fine  making out on that old pull out couch  watching saturday night live, I guess that's why  I feel so funny deep inside  when I lick between your thighs   sugarhigh.....sugarhigh  alright... (laughing)  and I have searched both far and wide  and I've explored the deepest caverns of my mind  to try and find an explanation why  I get this funny feeling deep inside  when you kiss me goodbye  and when I lick between your thighs   sugarhigh.....sugarhigh.....sugarhigh.....sugarhigh....shhhhhhhhhhhhhh    So, vote for yourself on which you like best.  I gotta say, I think the duet really adds something to it, but seriously, it's Francis Coyote Shivers, how can you go wrong??
