Plus i wont be able to work for a while ne way i just want it for the summer holidays and by then i will be 16 ne way ! so haha Lol. I dont wanna work in a chip shop thanx very much. How do you know every single shop in Croydon says you have to be 16 ? Have you been in every one ? I doubt it very much ! Oh ok i'll shut up now
