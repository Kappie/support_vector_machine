It is just hard to see the truth through my tears.  I never meant to hurt you. It wasnt what i was trying to do. I just dont know how i am supposed to get through.  I cant do this all by myself. I need a little of your help. Cant you see the pain i was dealt?  The way you lied. It tears me up inside. That is what i am trying to hide.  The way you look at me. Is the way its supposed to be. I feel so damn free with you next to me.  I know this may sound played out. But that is what its all about. Knowing without a doubt, not needing to shout.  I wish that you could see. The way you make me believe. That someday you could love me.  I know it isnt true. There is no more me and you. But there is something i must do.  Goodbye to you is all i will say. So until another day. My tears will fade away.
