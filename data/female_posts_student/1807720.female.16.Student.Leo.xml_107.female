Then we did the social test and well it was pretty fun and got the same score on the M.C. and then of course we each wrote our own position paper for the test.  Then I cooked some pizza - the stuff from the box.  Remind me never to eat that stuff from a box again.  The calorie and fat content in that thing was disgusting and I am sure not the most healthiest.  Then we watched some TV - comedy - which was absolutely hilarious.  It was nice to have a good laugh.  I wanted to write in my blog right now for some reason.  I keep avoiding studying right now because I studied so much yesterday.  My head was pounding when I got home yesterday but after I finish writing it's going to be back to studying chem.  I have all the stuff down, and the only thing that really needs some extra practice now is re-arranging the formula.  I sure hope everything goes well.  After the chem final tommorow I am going to do math review because I was going to do some today, but I need to know chem.  Chem comes first in my mind.  I want so bad to make honors though.  It literally means the world to me because of all my effort.  I don't want to screw this up, and I am not going to.  I am going to do good.  Anyways I have to study some more Chem!!
