I kicked his butt; however, I think he was letting me win. Ah well, it was lots of fun. Around 1:30, I left with April, Sam, and Garrett to go to the mall. I wore Garrett's Kenshin costume into the mall and walked around for a while. people kept staring at me. Oh the hilarity. After that, I went home, got ready to leave, and left for the band auction. It was soooooo boring. But it was rather interesting. Matt Hill's mom has been really sick lately, so I asked him about her. Then we ended up talking about our current situation. Me and him, as everyone who reads this knows full and well, haven't been getting along at all this year. Well, he somewhat apologized, gave me a hug, and then told me he loved me. I wasn't really sure how to respond. I mean, if he had done that the day after all that stuff occured, then I would have gladly accepted that things could get back to normal. But now, what was once normal between us will never be normal again, no matter how much anyone might want to believe that. I WON'T let anything like what happened between me and Matt ever happen to me again. I just can't. I mean, if it wasn't for the few of my friends who actually knew and cared about mine and Matt's falling away from one another, I don't think I would have made it through this year at all. I was depressed for probably 3-4 months, but sometimes nobody noticed, which was a good thing. I don't want to seem like I'm trying to get attention or anything. But, thanks guys for helping me out this year, I really needed it. I love yall! Today: Today is going pretty good, I suppose. I went to church, then went to Garon's to eat lunch. It's sorta odd, Garon's is now a family restaurant, but it used to be a bar!!! Anyways, after lunch, we came home, and I've been trying to straighten up my room. It WILL be clean!!!! ish certain of it! lol Last night: I had a really really odd dream. It was somewhat scary, except for the fact that I think it will never happen to me. Anywho, here it is.  In my dream, I was just walking around with someone, I don't remember who, I just know it was one of my friends. Then, someone else who looked suspiciously like Saddam Hussien jumped out of nowhere with some army type guys and attacked us! They tied us up and then told us about how he was going to blow up the nuclear plant, and they then sat us down in the middle of the nuclear plant, next to a few of my other friends who were all bound and gagged. I KNOW IT SOUNDS STUPID!!!! Then, they left, and we saw the timer for the bomb. The timer hit 00:00, and I heard an explosion, then woke up. I was just thinking, don't nuclear weapons basically make your skin melt off the bones? That would be a crappy way to die.  Coincidentally, the other day I was listening to the radio, and they were talking about nuclear weapons. Interestingly enough, they now make nuclear weapons that are ecosystem friendly!!!!!! HOW STUPID!! lol, " Why honey! of course this bombs kills thousands upon thousands of people, but they're environmentally friendly, so you can rest at ease." gah!!!!! Rediculous, if you ask me. Tsk Tsk people!  I've been thinking about the war on terrorism alot lately. It confuses me, so I have mixed feelings on it. Why are we fighting this war? I know that we have reasons for hunting down Osama Bin Ladin(can't spell) and Al Quieda for what they did to our country, but we don't seem to be getting anywhere. Every day more soldiers die. Just a few weeks ago, an army vehicle was blown to smithereens and some psycho Saudis were dragging a soldier's dead, charred body down the street! It's highly disturbing that things like that could go on over there. It really makes me thankful that the war isn't being fought over here. But when will all the fighting end? I know that there are some things worth fighting for, but when will we have what we want to achieve? Childish, pale questions I suppose, but they ARE relevent. I mean, I have friends who want to be in the armed forces, and I don't want to see them on the news being tortured or blown up. I just want this to be over. And I hope I don't sound unpatriotic or anything, because I love America as much as the next American. I just care too much about what will become of our country if the fighting doesn't stop. Will there be another draft instated, so that all men that are 18 or older get the pleasure of being forced to fight for a cause that they might not even believe is worth dying for?  All that I've said right there, I say because I have the right to, because I'm American. I appreciate and love my rights as an American citizen, and I'm NOT being unpatriotic. If you disagree with EVERYTHING I said today about our War on Terrorism, then please feel free to tell me so.  I'm off now, gotta finish cleaning my room. Sorry if this blog was so long, but I had to write all this down.  Love, Shannon "I might not believe a word you say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it."--Voltaire
