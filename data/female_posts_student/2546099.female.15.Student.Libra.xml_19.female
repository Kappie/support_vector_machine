My vulnerability is 1. without adequate protection: open to emotional or physical danger or harm. Some ppl played a very sick, immature and inconsiderate joke on me. The culprits were Jim and Josh. It was sumthing i could expect Josh 2 do but not jim, it seems very out of character for him. Well 2 start at the beginning, i was talking 2 Jim on msn ( i should have saved the convo but i thought of that aftawards.)and he was saying that he was feeling suicidal and depressed. He said it was bcoz of personal stuff and becoz he thought josh may have killed himself bcoz the last time they talked josh had slashed his wrists up. At this point i was getting really worried, scared and upset 4 both of them, i suprised myself by actually caring about josh at that time. I was trying 2 offer advice and sought out the problem to a certain degree until jim said that it was all a joke, in fact he had neva seen josh happier. I cant believe sum1 could make a joke about suicide, i mean i think this town has gotten a big wake up call since the passings of aaron and paul. I may have not known aaron and barely known paul but it affected me, it made me take suicide so much more seriouslya dn realise its not sumthing 2 joke about and its not sumthing u should do bcoz its hurts so many ppl. And then 2 follow when i had a go at them saying that it was a sick joke and all, josh had the nerve 2 say 2 me that i should just shut up and stop thinking that my life is shittier than every1 elses and stop being selfish and grow up. I neva realised that caring was immature but it must be if josh says so right? I know that i still have 2 grow up a lot more but i think that wat the 2 of them did was immature and inconsiderate, they would neva have dared do that 2 kristina, she would have taken it worse than me. Well enough of that, catchas l8er  *Lisa*
