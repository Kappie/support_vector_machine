I never thought I'd find an uncomfortable position there, but I think I did today. Maybe it's just because I'm feeling weird to start with.  Novak is right: the character of Kinbote in  Pale Fire  is despicable. I can't stand him, he's always so self-righteous and thinks that Shade should've put his Zemblan theme into his last work. Sybil hates him, and that's quite right. There's a reason he didn't get his Zemblan theme, there's a reason the Shades didn't tell him where they were really staying, there's a reason why John didn't want to tell Kinbote about his poem in the first place. The more I read, the more I compare Kinbote to Matt. Both are bullheaded, both think they  have  to be right, both annoy me with their lack of perception, humility and respect for others.  I'm inclined to think that Nabokov intentionally created such a character, that it isn't in the author's intrinsic nature to insert a character so stupid (for want of a better word), to let such an ignorant figure dictate the course of his novel, if we can even call it that. If it's not intentional, then I don't think I can say that I respect Nabokov as a writer.  I remember I wrote up a list of books I wanted to read at the beginning of summer. I think I'll have to revise, for most of the stuff on there is pop and, therefore, trash. I should read up on more classics.  So here's the new one, just to jog my memory: finish Sons and Lovers Middlemarch Portrait of a Lady Ulysses any Toni Morrison Finnegan's Wake any Virginia Woolf The French Lieutenant's Woman any Gish Jen A Doll's House any Albert Camus (The Plague...etc.) finish In Search of Lost Time Beckett's Malone Dies and The Unnamable get Soul Mountain again and actually finish it  I should find my old list at home, cross off all the bad ones and remake one. I used to keep a running list. I wonder where this ratty piece of paper went.  I'm not looking forward to leaving this place, but sometimes I also itch for change, to be able to go home and see old people again. To be back in my kind of normal society. I'm leaving on the 20th, a Friday. We're driving out to Cape Cod and arriving in Princeton at night. We'll see Princeton on Saturday, drive the hour to NYC and spend Sunday there, and see Columbia on Monday. Monday night we're flying back at 6:30, so we'll probably get back to LA at around 8. I just don't know when everyone else is going to leave...I know it's a lemming-like mindset, but I don't want to leave until everyone else does. In retrospect, that's silly logic. I'll see Charlie and Jenn when I get back home, and they're the people I'm closest to here.  Yeah, I'll be ok.  Back to this maddening Nabokov stuff.
