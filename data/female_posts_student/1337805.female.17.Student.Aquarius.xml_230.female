Consilation, I get to go shopping in-between for my Care Bear shirt.   Nicky, Matt, Sean, Steve and Misha leave tomorw for Calgary. Jeena leaves Sunday for Albert Edward. They are all instructed to bring me back something furry from the Calgary Zoo, save Jeena. She gets to bring me back a leaf, or some snow or something. Hurray.  I'll remember Nick for the five days he's gone though...ooooh boy.........love you baby, hope you still remember me..
