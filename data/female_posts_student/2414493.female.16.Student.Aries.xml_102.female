Good intentions have always been just that, but when I look into other perspectives I begin to unravel them all. It's not that I mind that they're falling apart for it's the truth and it's not like things are going to change if I dispute it, but how far does human goodness for the sake of goodness extend? Why do you always feel that little tug when you're doing something without ulterior motives, and why do you always smirk when you're not?  But I overanalyze. Ask anyone, lol. Except they're not around right now because of powerful things under my control.  So this is my March in terms of piano: Mar. 3 volunteer dinner Mar. 6 advanced panel Mar. 25 Bricard master class Mar. something Colburn master class I wonder if I'm good enough. I need to practice.  It's like I still haven't woken up from Sunday yet. This morning I wallked into English only to find out that I'd totally forgotten bagel sales with J for Class of '05. The irony is that I actually woke up at 6 to check what time it was, congratulated myself for being so responsible, and then went back to sleep until 6:40. And I still owe her the pie pan and the gas money, but I bought her lunch today. It just feels like I'm a few beats behind: life is a cacophony.  And I somehow feel bad for what I do in math class--instead of actually doing the homework the night before, I do it in class when she's going over it. Mind you, I don't copy the answers, but I still feel that I'm somehow disrespecting an elder.  Little things like that. The happier I am, the more school life spins out of control. I am more than willing to adjust the equilibrium, but I haven't perfected it yet. It's funny how I am so ready to think that just as one thing improves, another worsens. MT this year was, by far, the best time yet, but at what cost? And this past month--the beginning of it, really--was priceless. Now that we're in March, I felt like I've left so many good times behind--I can see my life as one of those shots from a straight desert highway with dry shrubbery all around and blue sky, and there's the road sign: DEPARTING FEBRUARY. And all that it implies.  Funny visualizations. I've always been the kid to turn to imagination to solve those little problems: fates are little slips of paper drawn out of bowls by some divine power on his cloudy throne, God answers prayers by entering little rooms glowing red in a dark, infinite hallway. And now happiness and obligation are balanced on a scale.  How beautiful would life be if it were a fugue?  Well, after a few days of meditation, I've realized that happiness can't be faked.  Will little satisfactions propel me through a day?
