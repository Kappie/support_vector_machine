It was as close to having Jesse home and next to me as I could get. Our conversations were like old times. All of the playful things he would say to me when he was here. It is good to know that he hasn’t changed much. I have also noticed that once he got to Kuwait, things seemed to be a little more at ease for him and when we talk I get to talk to my husband and not the soldier, which I like. It is sort of like having him away on a trip and sometimes, rarely, it almost feels like  he is just away on a camping trip and not assigned to Kuwait as part of the Military support for Operation Iraqi Freedom.   I do hate that he is gone, but I feel deep down in my heart that everything will be ok. I don’t feel panic and anxiety of him being over there. I just hope that my intuition is accurate and nothing is going to happen to him.  I am sure everything will be fine.
