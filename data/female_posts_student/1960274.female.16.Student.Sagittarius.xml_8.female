After we got back from the Bahamas, it seems like I haven't even had much of a summer. Between work, church, and now FMT practices have started, I've been pretty busy. I pity all you Delphi students who have to start school tomorrow. Our retreat is on Monday and Tuesday, schedule day on Wednesday, Band on Thursday (9-2:30...long time), and then school on Friday. Basically you could say we start Monday. Even though I don't want to go back, August 20 is still coming. So I might as well have a good attitude about it. Every year I tell myself that this is going to be "the year". The year I make straight A's, the year I reach out to everyone, the year I really make a difference. I normally start out strong, but after a few months, I'm back to the old me, living for myself. So this year I've decided not to jump into the year with thousands of expectations and huge goals, but rather with one goal. I want to deny myself during this school year. I want to push the focus off me and out in on others. OUr school theme is Loving God Through Loving Others. I think that's a great theme- thanks Jordan! God must really trying to be teaching me that I am too self focused. Last year the theme was Leading With a Servant's Heart...and sadly I don't think I applied that to the extent that I should have. Then I've been studying self denial since January with my SMITE team, and now loving God through loving others. This year I really do want to reach out to the people in my school. If I learned one thing in the Bahamas it was how much me taking a little time to focus on the other people can effect them. All I need to do is sacrifice a little time and really love someone, and it could make such a difference in their life. I don't always realize how big of an impact I could make on someone. I get so wrapped up in my world that I forget to step outside and take a look at all the hurting people. So I'm not starting out my Junior year trying to be the best at everything. I'm starting out with a different attitude though. An others oriented attitude. Hopefully, there will be some lives that are helped through that. Enjoy your few days left of summer...and have a great school year!  And he won a free book off the radio.
