Damn........the thought of it make me sick.........Yuckkkk  i went tojog just now.....i wanted to climb the hill.......but it was way too sunny......n i cant bear another series of headaches from the sun......---------> its weird.......im always freezing at sch.....but its like.....inside im hot or anything.......like.....headaches...n damn i got a huge ulcer rite underneath my lower lip.......its like ur suppose to get ulcer when ur hot inside...like they call in chinese "re qi"...热气.......ok so now my body temperature is like the weather........unstable.........  Anyway....i ran two  half laps.....n....throughout it......my mind is like playing a game or sth.....i kept thinking......well i think alot normally but extra more..... i was wondering about alot of things.....its like.....human self counsel sort of stuff.....ok so i sound like im counselling myself......well at least im not going down the drain yet........  i was wondering why   we   tend to take note or remember wat other ppl did......their behaviors......but not   our   own...??? Why  we  tend to remember wat other ppl said but not wat   we   said..............why do   we   always easily spot tiny little mistakes other ppl did......but hardly notice or completely blind to   our   own giant mistakes.......why are   we   always tat stubborn n narrow minded to believe the truth even though it happening right under   our   nose.......why are   we   always picking or pointing at someone else but not ourselves......is it because it will make us feel better....by stepping someone else....?? or this is the so called self esteem boost...????  ok so no offence on the   WE   n   OUR   word used.....just ignored it n take is as     im saying myself only then...well to bad it matches me like helll..........unless well tats if anyone who is readingis too narrow minded to believe the truth n lie.....worse lying to urself.....duh..........  These always happen.....well because we're human......n im really feelin so weird.......i mean......why suddenly i came up with a bunch of thoughts......its not tat i did sth or anything........i just feel weird.........becoz i am weird....????.  CRAP!!!!!!
