A little on the boring side. well, ALOT on the boring side. I got alot of chiggers too. probably around 40-50. They itch so bad. and when we got back Friday from camping, we left Friday afternoon to go to Franklin, Tennessee to go to Inky's softball tournament. That was alright too, I guess. Also a little on the boring side. Band camp is next week. whoopie!......not really. I'm NOT excited about band camp. not at all.  School starts back in roughly 2 weeks. Which is good. It'll get me out of the house and away from all the food. The only bad things is that I'll have to get up early again. I haven't talked to Nick since Saturday, which makes me sad. We haven't seen each other in over 3 weeks. I think he's trying to avoid me. jk! but seriously, I was gonna invite him over Wednesday night, and I dunno if I'll be able to get in touch with him by then! He's never home, nor is he online. grr. Ah well. See yall all laterz.  Love, Shannon
