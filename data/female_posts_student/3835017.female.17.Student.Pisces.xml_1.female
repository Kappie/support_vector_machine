He looks innocent enough with the light blue hair that is longer on the right side with the bangs and a loose ponytail in the back. His headband is placed across the forehead like intended with the bangs covering the very sides of the metal and some of the blue. He has a light complexion with a little bit of color, a cloud tattoed on his right shoulder and the anbu sign on the other. He wears the usual anbu outfit with a fishnet trenchcoat covering it, his mask is tied to his thigh and it resembles a wolf. On days he is off duty he is still wearing the trenchcoat and goes between tight tanktops of all colors and just normal cargo pants.  Personality: A basically laid back type of person, he likes to flirt around a bit but ignores getting a real relationship or anything because he has a thing against commitment. It's pretty hard to catch him being nostalgic or even a bit serious about anything no matter how hard you try. Kinda of like a a shield protecting him from any damage he's able to usually keep a smile or at least a slightly pleased look on his face even when he isn't in a good mood. Getting to see him without the shield only proves that he trusts you or you've pissed him off. It's hard to even get a reaction out of him for trivial things unless it pertains to him one way or another. He's a slightly a disagreeable person but when someone does try and fight with his opinion a very harsh "whatever" will most likely escape his lips. Whatever it takes to avoid conflict with someone else and he'll do it, unless it leads down to saying sorry. If he has to he'll avoid the person for the rest of their lifes. Getting him extremely mad isn't something you'd want to do...  History: The Kumori clan has an advanced bloodline that has to deal with a 'second form' type being. It's what would be called a berserker to most, their appearance doesn't change as much as most but it also varies on how angry they get and how pure the blood of the clan is in them. Do to this bloodline and how strong it is in Tsuyu, as a child he grew up with no mother because she died giving birth to him and a father who abused him in almost anyway thinkable. At an early age he was allowed into the academy. This gave him many reasons to stay out of home. the one he took a liking to was training. He'd already learned the basics and soon had to start borrowing scrolls off of his teacher. This brought him to the top of his class and graduation soon followed too. He was extremely young graduating thought, about the age of 9 precisely. Being a ninja was the only way to get away from his father and also became his life. One night, about a month before his first chuunin exam he came home a bit too late. His dad was furious but to what Tsuyu remembers, he was just sent to his room without dinner. The next day he woke up in his own room, soaked completely in what he thought was his own blood. Everytime he moved it hurt. Furthering his inspection because he was curious, he found his father brutally murdered. Nobody was able to figure out how it happened either. So, Tsuyu was sent to live with that of the very own Gekkou Hayate's family. He would have missed the chuunin exam due to grief if a certain sickly boy hadn't persuaded him otherwise. During the exam's individual fights he lost one of his genin team members. Ironically though, he had to fight the same person and went berserk. Even though he made the mistake of losing it he had passed but bore one word of advice, 'control it'. Because of this he feared he'd turn out like his father. From then he forced himself to change into what he is today, a very strong anbu member with complete control over what his clan had lost many years back. Somehow he feels that's the only job he'll be happy with and has been one since he was around 16 (He became a jounin at 15). Everyone was still scared of him though, all except Hayate who turned to be his only friend. Then the tragic day occured when Hayate died. From then on he promised himself to never cry or show he was hurt ever again, all because it didn't seem worth it anymore.  (I just got liz's draft because i finished most..might edit it some)
