So I  dont really know how many people are going to be tracking this AT ALL, but I  dont even really know if I care yet... So. What to talk about. I'm afraid that I  am at a loss. Ok, so I'm going to do what all the great, wonderful,  knowledgeable writers did before me, and make a list of cast characters. Just so  that when I write, I dont have to keep explaining each time who each person is.  Ok? Ok lets go.  Jamie: my best guy friend. We hang out on average about  twice a week. We just hash around his place and talk about music, sex,  literature, college, etc. I dont know if there is anything that is too personal  for us to talk about. Its strange though- we're not hugging sort of friends.  Ours is a relationship that is hard to explain.  Emily: My great girl  friend that is currently in Finland. Her and I are much alike- we enjoy talking  on the phone loads about boys and such. I was listed in her cast as the person  friend that makes plans, but we hardly ever carry them out, and I suppose that  up until now, that has been rather true. However- that will change. :P She  leaves for college next year though... and so I will be sad.  Josh: Josh  is my friend that will forever be my friend. He's a wonderful super duper guy,  and I often call him "Haimes" or "Haimesy" or "James Haimes" so not to be  confused. He is a great friend who tap dances and who has saved people's  lives... and if you want to embarrass him, bring up the subject of sex. He  learned to take it though- while hanging out with Jamie and I in the library  last year.  Ashley: Is part of the foursome that is "Ash,Jess,Jaime,Jodi"  we are all in band together, and all hang out at lunch together, etc. More about  that later. Oh- and Ashley's bf is Chris- who I rather find to be a fine  gentleman.  Morgan: She lives down the street from me half the year, and  yet we have never hung out. Ever. Im not exaggerating.  Cassidy: A really  good, rather new, friend of mine. He's like a teddy bear- always there for a hug  and to talk to. He's sometimes there and sometimes away... on vacation, but he  always manages to be there right when I need him. He's a super duper cool guy  and I'm going to miss him also when he leaves for college. He's going to  Evergreen though- where Jamie and I have been plotting to attend. So maybe we'll  be seeing him there. Either way- he's a great guy. Oh also as a side note- in  this drama, Emily and Marie cannot stand Cassidy. Which brings me  to....  Marie: A good friend of mine, who has really been there for me for  years. Her and I are not really the type of friends that hang out every week,  but we talk quite often, and she's a great person. :)  Kaeli: my sister.  She's 14, and she drives me nuts. Dresses crazy, but we're closing the gap  gradually between styles.  Lucas: my brother. He's 9. Knows an insane  amount about just about everything. Ask him about a car part and wish you hadnt.  He's a great kid tho and really cares a lot about everything. Gotta love him.   Andy: My new boyfriend. He's a great guy, and I'm sure that I will have  loads to say about him in here. He's got red hair too which is hot. And this  wonderful, loving, intellectual manner. He's got this awesome personality that  really inspires awe in me. :P Im sure that I'm going to have an awesome time  being his gf... and this sounds like a freaking business arrangement. Its not.  Im sorry Andy- I just cant come up with a description that would do you justice.  ;) Help me out?  And so that brings me to the end of my list. Besides  mentioning my parents. Both awesome, and unlike most kids, I love them. My mom  is the type of mom who notices things like when I'm not wearing a bra and makes  fun of me. We're a very 'open' family I suppose. But I love it. Anyways-- I'm  tired... Email me or leave a comment if you want me to add something. I'll be  glad to comply. :)
