I believe that nothing is certain, it is only what we perceive of it. It depends on each and every person's point of view, and what they believe would be considered good or evil. For someone to categorize behavior is to me, closed-minded and naive. What is good? What is evil? Why are some things "more evil" than others? what these people are not taking into account is that every individual person is different, and capable and incapable of different things. Everybody thinks differently, everybody functions differently. And people need to stop trying to classify and judge things. many do not open their minds and do so. According my theory, every individual person's view is correct. It just depends on who you ask, and what you decide to believe. There is no right or wrong. Not meaning to lower the confidence in my argument, this, to me, is only what I think.  Ya know what's funny? It hasn't even been a year since I wrote this, but now it seems so lame. When I wrote it I thought I was a fucking genius. Just goes to show how much we really do grow over time.
