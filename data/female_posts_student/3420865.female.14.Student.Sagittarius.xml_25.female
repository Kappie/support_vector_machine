EVER. seriously. wow.   so i had to take the bus to her house... and it's funny cuz i had no idea what to do. cuz i a)didn't know what bus to take, and b)didn't know what bus stop to get off at... and nikole said she'd be waiting when i got off the bus, buuuut she wasn't. eff.  so it 45 minutes to take the bus there. seriously, why do buses take so f-cking long? if my brother were to drive me, then it would have taken 15 minutes to get to nikole's house from my house... that's a half an hour difference, for those of you who are mathemetically challenged.  so anyways... me and nikole chilled at her crib for like half an hour, then we went to "big bear", which is a convenience store... and the guy behind the counter was smiling at us the whole time. i kindof felt uncomfortable.  then we walked back through the ghetto to nikole's house... and we played yahtzee. (i think that's how you spell it.) but i sucked at it cuz i've never played it before, so we watched billy madison. wow it's THE randomest movie ever! i love it though.  aaand then... we had soup. it was so cool... and then i went home. (p.s. nikole, you're not boring. you ROCK.)  i've decided that i'm way too bitter towards the world (due to my list of things i hate about people, and the thing about friends). i was sitting on the bus, and i thought to myself "hey kate, maybe you should write something nice about people for once." so i shall put that on my list of things to do before school starts again. (i think i'll write it soon, so stay tuned.)  aaah i'm pretty sure i've decided that sofija is my favourite person in the world.  k so my brother's having a party in the basement right now... it's kindof funny, because people just started arriving at like 10. i wonder how long they'll be here for...  aaah i'm so booked for this week i think... ok, so not really.   tomorrow - hanging out with jess... she just came back from her grade 8 trip to quebec. and apparently she has  a lot  to tell me. woot.  monday - nothing.  tuesday - movies avec lana and co.  wednesday - going to the taylor evans talent show avec sofija. but it's in the morning, so i have to be dropped off at her house at frikin 8. eff.  and that's it.   in a hail of sparks, and a tangle of wires- everything went wrong. says:  i [heart] you.  [there are just some things that time cannot erase] says:  i [fart] on you.  *phone rings* "hello?"-me "hey, what's up?"-james (brother) "uhh nothing..."-me, not knowing why my brother is calling me/being nice to me.
