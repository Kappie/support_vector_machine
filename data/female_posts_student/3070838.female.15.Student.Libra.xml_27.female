Bare in mind, they're pretty funny if you step back and think of me in their place lol.   MY TRUE NATIONALITY: French  You have high standards when it comes to cuisine, which should always be fresh, of the highest-quality ingredients and prepared beautifully. You are more inclined to use the rules of etiquette and social interaction as your guide to living life. Like many French, you have a developed sense of sophistication in love and social rules. You have impeccable taste and style and have perfected the search for quality of life, pleasure, well being and pleasant sensations.   WHAT KIND OF GOD I WOULD MAKE: Mystic Buddha  You would make an excellent New-Age god, the sort of entity that becomes ever more difficult to understand the more you learn about it. You are attuned to the cosmos in such a way that the mystical and religious are one in the same. The universe is God, and you are the universe.    You are a healthy skeptic who enjoys finding and laughing at the ridiculous aspects of life, other people and even yourself.  You have a good sense of humor that allows you to see through ploys and scams. You enjoy hearing about people's beliefs, superstitions and paranoia, if only to laugh inwardly at the follies of human nature. Ever the ironic, kitsch-seeking reveler in human absurdities, you will humor someone who wants to tell you about their latest brush with the supernatural â€¦ if only for the funny stories you'll be able to tell your friends later.   Funness, lol.  Luvz, ~*Phileda*~
