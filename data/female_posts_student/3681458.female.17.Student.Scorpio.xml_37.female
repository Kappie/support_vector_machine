There's a group of us that has all four blocks together.  Me, Alex, Spencer, Nathan, David, Travis, Jason are all together.  And I have three blocks with Foster.  One with Emi.  And we have lunch with Megan.  Oh gosh, it's so much friggin fun.  My schecule is: A.P. Calculus A.P. English 4 A.P. Government Anatomy and Physiology  It's not really that hard, surprisingly.  The one class I am sorta worried about would be the calculus class.   Jason has me working at six. So, I go to school, go to practice, and then I go to work.   I pulled my groin muscle at practice.  Ouch, so now I have to wrap it and ice it.  It hurts uber bad.   But this is all for now.  Maybe I will find something interesting to post about in the near future.  But not for now.
