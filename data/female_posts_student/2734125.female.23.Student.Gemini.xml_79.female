Its not that I ever really thought that you wouldn't come again, just that it would take more time, more forgetting... but then, that was part of the plan, was it not?  Having watched for as many years as consciousness has allowed the ebb and flow of the universe, I expected there to be some kind of a sustained period of waiting... But then, we are talking about surprise again aren't we?  We are talking about the moment of realization that, even while all the clues were there, all the inner alarms ringing, there is still something inside that says, "oh shit, I never saw that coming."  That moment is a high, blurred by tequila and strange company, spurred on by the insistent buzz of sex, strong scents hardly recognized by the conscious mind, but taken in full by the animal self.  Yes, you came artfully, gracefully, filled with sublty and a touch of the ridiculous, and yes, I bow to you, as I always do, always will.  You and I will never be equals, but it comforts me that I am made from you, that I am constructed of your soul.  I am pleased to note my quiet awe and overall amusement at this new twist of the knife you so gently managed.  You are a mystery novel where all the clues are there, and we were just looking the other way.  You are the child who we expected to be counted on to be good, caught with crayon line etchings on white walls, and when asked about this transgression, simply smiles and looks shy.  You are the secret knowing, longing, darkness and, possibly more important, absence of light, which we stare into time and again.  You are the present I wasn't expecting, and you always are, no matter how many times you give me gifts.  I am sensing a shift in the pattern.  When I shut my eyes, I am slightly frightened by the sheer force, gale force, strategic force, time wearing water force of you.  I know that you will break me.  You always do.  And there is a calm anticipation this time.  I am attempting the art of holding without clutching, of seeing without owning, of looking without judging.  As you point out, I am far from a master.  Even the masters learn more by your hand, your weave, your touch and slightly burning kiss.  You were there last night, in that moment of hot recognition.  I heard you laughing behind a screen, watching through the eyes of a jade dancer in wild turning silk.  You are laughing each time I look at the slightly swelling bruises, turned upon my skin by friends unknowingly playing the part of refuge- can I feel earthly pain to comprehend the ultimate submission that you request?  Can I feel muscles stretched, and until the game grows old, continue to seek purchase, and it is futile, and I still push.  It was all a metaphor for you, though I didn't know it at the time.  You are so earthly, so base, so acutely acid, that at times you make my bile rise- then I recall the lesson on finding the fearfully ugly beautiful, and I fall away smiling at the slime you drag me through.  I lick it and suck it in- lap it up into my soul, ignorant child proving they can eat the vegetables.  You mock me, tease me, leave me wanting more every single time, and you are the ultimate lover that I know I will never feel in control of- that I would never want to be in control of.  You are the dreams that didn't come this morning, since I slept so little, and that was the sleep of exhausted sex.  You are the thin veiled haze on the world the next morning, milking this shadowed day into diamonds of colorless flesh on the leaves of trees.    So once again I bow to you, show my neck to you, beg for you when I know you will be coming, beg just to touch your moment in my every motion.  To you I show all my frailty, to you I give all my strength, but then you would never have me any other way.
