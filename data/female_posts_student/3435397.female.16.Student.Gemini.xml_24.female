Why is my dad a dink the last week I am in REGINA?!?!?!! ARGH!!!! This sucks! Oh well my life will go on...I hope!  okay so I find out that Josh got the job at camp no big deal alright I don't mind I am fine with it but then I find out that on Tuesday the still haven't phoned Braden to tell him he didn't get a job!!!! That's the stupidest thing I have ever heard! It isn't fair for Braden!!!! Later Gator!
