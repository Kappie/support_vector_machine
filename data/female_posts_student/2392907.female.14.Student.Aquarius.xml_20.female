I wish I knew where he lived,  she thinks, unfortunately unaware that he lives only across the road.  You know, that tattered old Ford looks rather familiar. I think it was at the restaurant.  But as Adam's car was "around the corner", Jane thought nothing of it.  She rings up Nazrene. "Hello?" "Hi Naz, it's me." "Are you coming then?" "Erm.. yeh. But Adam isn't." "Why not?" "He hasn't phoned me yet. And I don't have his number." "Ah well. You can come alone. Get off with a few guys..." "I can't do that!" "Hmmm?" "I'm with Adam." "So? Ah well, suit yourself." "Where is it then?" "Can't remember. James is picking me up, so meet at mine and you can come with us." "OK. See you there." "Bye!"
