I just got back from Ashleigh's house; we hung out and chilled which is cool cuz I'm really not the 'OMG! Let's go to the mall' type . I'm more of an 'oh okay, sure let's just chill.' SO, we(me ashleigh, scott, and ashleigh's lil' bro) went to Larkspur and chilled there. Scott hates me though which is fine but he doesn't have to make it so apparent, but it's fine. I am SO SO SO UBER stressed about school I hate it, I wish it was just an option that we could choose to go or not to. Hmmm... Well, I gtg my mother is getting suspicious. tty'all later lyl bye
