There are so many emotions I am feeling right now and so many things that I keep thinking about.  I just had to go onto that U-courses site and check my marks didn't I?  And there was a stupid 60% that made my waste half-an-hour crying.  I got a 60% on the chem. quiz we did Wedneday and there is NOTHING else I could have done.  I thought I did good, I can't believe I could do that bad.  I seriously thought I got like a 90% and I studied all night and even reviewed at lunch.  Why did I get  60%?????  I TRIED.  I want more than anything to understand and well I did think I understood that quiz.  And well if I thought I understood that quiz and I did bad, well now I am worried about the quiz I did today.  I tried to understand the stuff but I just DON'T UNDERSTAND.  I can't help that fact that I "don't get it."  When I started that quiz my mind just went blank.  I couldn't remember anything, of course it didn't help that I didn't get much sleep because of the dance.  But I even got up early to study and practice my chem.  My marks are NOT from lack of effort, and I do ask her ofter how to do things so my marks in chem aren't bad because I don't ask enough questions because that is not the case.  I don't know why I don't seem to understand.  It's frustrating.  Especially the unit now.  EVERYONE seems to understand the stuff, and I am TRYING to "get it" but I ask and ask and ask about how to do stuff.  And yes she explains it to me but it makes no sense.  I feel really bad that I don't understand her.  I want to understand.  I want to do good.  I just don't know what else to do.  My marks in chem don't reflect my effort and this unit seems to come very easily to everyone.  NOTHING ever comes easily for me.  I feel like no one understand me right now, and if I told them how I feel they just would not understand.  No one understand what it is like to wake up everyday knowing how much effort and time I spend trying to understand my stuff and my marks SUCK.  No one understands what it is like believe that you can do something and just when you think you understand and know it you end up failing another quiz.  No one understands how it feels to fail over and over when I try so hard.    No one understands how frustrated I can get with everything and how difficult things are for me.  I want to understand.  I feel so bad.  I feel like the chem teacher is puting in effort to try help me understand and I just never seem to "get it."  I want to do good in chem.  I need to do good in chem.  I want to major in the Science field and I SUCK at chem.  How would that make anyone else feel.  Image if you tried SOOOOOOOO hard at EVERYTHING and your marks never showed your effort and you failed numerous times but you know you tried really hard.  Just imagine that you had a dream of being a science teacher someday yet some concepts from science you couldn't grasp from the previous year so in the present year it is really difficult.  So difficult just imagine trying to learn a new language but in a limted amout of time.  That's what it feels like - It's like chem is the forign language.  Think about how many times I've tried over and over, how many times I have asked "how do I do this?  How do I do that" and I still don't understand.  Image how many times I have cried because I want to be able to finish my homework and do it correctly but I can't finish or do it correctly because I don't understand.  Just imagine.  For one day if someone could just picture that.  Image that for just one day then multiply it by 365 and then by how old you are.  Yes, EVERYDAY that is what is feels like.  EVERY SINGLE DAY.  I have lost count of all the nights I have cried because I don't understand, all the nights I have cried because I just want to understand, all the nights I have cried because I tried hard and my marks don't show it all all, all the nights I cried because I failed again, all the nights I cried because I never seem to understand, all the nights I have wished to be dead because it feels like too much to handle, all those nights that I wanted to drop chem because of the difficult time I am having with learning and understanding it, all those nights I thought about dropping Chem. but I didn't because I have a dream.  I will NOT give up my dream.  I want MORE THAN ANYTHING in the world just to be a science teacher and to be happy.  That is all.  So if I can make it through high school and do my best in my Sciences, if I can get into University and get through that, and if I can graduate from that, than that is really all I want.  I want also to be happy but it's difficult to feel happy if you are me.  There is so much in this world that I would change if I could.  The first that would be just to make myself UNDERSTAND.  All I want for Christmas is just to UNDERSTAND.  That is all.  The ONLY thing I want right now.  If I could just understand things and make sense of them then I know I could do alot better in a lot of things.  I am so worried about next week.  All the chem tests I have next week.  Just the thought of them stressess me out.  I have *3* tests on Tuesday - THREE.  I have to do the Math test and the Chem test, and the Chem re-write.  That is too much to handle in one day.  I don't know how I will remember everything and well I still don't understand those ICE tables and since Stoich is confusing for me titration calculations I always seem to mess up one way or another.  Then on Thursay and Friday there is the Chapter 9 test and I am very confused and lost when it comes to Chapter 9.  I thought the quiz was hard and that was just a quiz.  If I thought the quiz was hard then the unit test is probably like three times harder.  I HAVE to do good on those tests.  I don't want my average in Chem to drop again.  I am sick of it always dropping.  It seems like the more I try, the more my average just continues to decrease.  It doesn't make any sense does it.  That's why I am SOOOOO confused about what to do.  I feel like I have done EVERYTHING I could, but nothing is helping out my Chem. mark.  I want to make honours for the end of Semester 1 but my hope is slowing fading.  I deserve it and I know that, but if I don't make it I know I will just wonder what all that effort was for.  I guess for my dreams but I AM DOING MY BEST.  I feel though that my marks should be way better, and I think I will always wonder "why can't my marks be better?"  Like what am I doing wrong???  I just don't know and it's frustrating.
