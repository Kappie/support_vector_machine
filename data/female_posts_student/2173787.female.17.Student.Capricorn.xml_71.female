I was probably about 13 and decided that I was grown up, I knew everything, understood everything and there was no wonder left in the world.  I had conquered it all and anybody who questioned was just wrong.  Somwhere along the way my perception changed and i now realize that I'm further than ever from knowing the end of innocence.  I'm no longer certain, no longer wonderless and I think I like that.
