YAY... who loves niptuck??? we do!!! everyone does... well yes today i did something very out of the ordinary... i did something with matty spittel... dun dun dun... weird Aye?  but we actually had a good time and hes one of my new buddies... he's actually a lot different to me now than when we were going out... but still i had a good time there and it all went smoothly and im sure he will see more of me in the future... hahahaha the poor kid hes going to want a gun before the summers out... either he'll shoot me or he'll shoot himself... haha... i decided i really want something worthwhile to write about on here and i never have anything... what is wrong with me do i not care about world matters or important things like that?? i feel like i am just taking up some space with my pathetically pathetic life that is just rotting away... why do i sit here and mourn over some random thing like how i ate too much chocolate for breakfast and now im vomiting all over the place when i could be sitting here writing about how i made a difference or how others could make a difference... i have nothing insightful to say and im disappointed in myself... and now instead of say something worthwhile im telling all of you how i think that i am useless when it comes to talking about things that matter... but i think i know why that is... its because i dont want to grow up!!! things that are important are things that adults talk about not things that kids do and i just want to be an immature teenager right now, why are people rushing me to grow up so quickly? most kids sit at home wishing that they are older and can do all the fun things older kids can where i am sitting here wishing that people would stop trying to get me to get a job or would stop pressuring a serious relationship on me because i just want to be a kid and do kiddie things... why do some many kids force themselves to grow up so quickly when they know deep down that they really want to sit around a table the burp with a bunch of friends or go outside and light bugs on fire? seriously we all know when we are teenagers that someday we will be old and we will wish that we were young again and able to do all that immature stuff so why rush into being an adult when you can sit around doing kid things and having fun and living your teenage years for what they are worth. the whole reason we have these years are so that you can immature before you have to grow up and have kids and a serious full time job or maybe even just college... im just hate it when people say i wish i were older... why the  HELL  would you want to be older... whoa when your 18 you can buy cigarettes but what the hell is the point of smoking anymore if its not illegal (by the way i hate cigarettes it is the  most digusting  thing you could do so stop!!!) oh but wait cigarettes may not be illegal but having sex with younger teens is so whoa you can still be rebellious well you know youre getting 50 different std's oh or maybe you'd want to be 21 so you can drink, um yeah well maybe you want to become a lush but i dont... i have absolutely nothing against drinking, i myself have done and does it but once its there at your disposal you can become a lush and an alcoholic and never get anywhere in life except of the month of december when you can dress up as santa and fuck every girl in sight and swear at little kids... god damn who would ever do that to themselves and who would keep living like that for so many years? go out and get help!! please... i know so many people who throw their lives away doing stupid shit like that and it makes me want to cry... i myself dont want to throw away my life i really want to go as far as i can and i want to have a worthwhile life, why even live if you are dependent on so substance to keep you going when youre upset, down or even happy come on people wake up!! life is more than high school and impressing every person!! life goes on after that point and then you know what you have do something more than party to get anywhere... okay well my rides here so im done for now but dont be surprised if i bring this up again!!!
