A Rod hit two homers against Detroit, the Mets beat the Phillies in 11 innings, and Shawn Green hit a game winning grand slam in the top of the 8th to beat the D-Backs 4-3. *Giants vs. Rockies: Jerome Williams had a rocky (no pun intended) first inning when he gave up two runs, but then settled downand the Giants got the lead 3-2 until a JT Snow error to make it 4-3 Rockies. However, Shawn Chacon got rocked in the ninth, the Giants scored 4, and won 7-5 despite Scott Eyre having to bail out Matt Herges *Now, I'm off to the A's-White Sox game. Fireworks night is always fun!
