S neways I have two emails you can write to me on but I don't know which one I check more frequently. 1. melby_2@hotmail.com but beware it might take me a while. This stupid nerdy jerk we have at school has blocked all of our hotmail things so I only check this one at my boyfriends house. 2. melby@eudoramail.com Again beware I get alot of shitty spam so if u write to me here please in your topic write blogger or something cos if not I will just delete your message along with the rest of my junk. By the way if the angry guy Aaron Allen is reading this send me one you bastard. That is so I can be acknowledged as another person you can hate in this world. Well catch all love ye Melby xxx
