The bit you are eating has been in direct contact with the soil, or it would have been if they were actually british, and not grown by some poor third worlder, with less income even than you. Also, i have yet to come acroos a chip that i could not fit into one mouthful. Of course, i cant be right. Because you see so many wedge and fish shops, but fish and chips... pah, its got no ring to it, you know?
