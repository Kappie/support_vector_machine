Wild 100.3 fm is now 100.3 Jack fm.  What the hell?!  thats the stupidest name for a radio station EVER.  So yeah, no more Fitz radio programe, no more Billy the Kid or Special Ed (maaan i'm going to miss Billy, he was sooo funny) or Michelle the Lesbian (they called her that even though she wasn't a lesbian).....Jack Fm sucks!  Well i guess its kinda good because there are absolutely NO commercials.  But their slogan is "don't call us and tell us what to play, we play what we want, when we want".  and i was like wow, that sucks, no more requesting songs.  And they play alot of 70's and 80's music as well as early 90's and unless you're a nerd like me who loves nostalgic songs from those time periods, you're not gonna like it.  Sorry to say it doesn't look like its going away any time soon.   tonight i have to go to this stupid fireworks show with my family which is going to be boring....bringing the cds baby!  I absolutely hate fireworks.....but this is largely because i am afraid of fire and because i have seen a million fireworks shows and to be honest they're all the same.  but its mostly because i hate fire.  If you've ever been in a science class with me, you know that there are 2 things that i won't do: dissect things (don't screw with the worms man!!  lol Lauren, pre ap biology freshman year, how i miss it) and light matches/bunsen burners.  Devon took the liberty in IPC first tri of lighting matches and blowing them out (so there was no way i would catch on fire) and throwing them at me just to watch me run to the other side of the classroom freaking out.  He thought this was very funny. Although he felt bad when i almost burned him with a match trying to light one.  after the fireworks, i'm going over to Britt's house for our Vincent Lecavalier party.  woot  gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
