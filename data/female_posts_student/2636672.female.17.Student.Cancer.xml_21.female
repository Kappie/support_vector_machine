Okay, no matter how all my other things on here sounded...they were in NO WAY supposed to make anyone feel that i thought matthew was being a bad boyfriend. because he is most definately NOT. he is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo wonderful i can't really explain how wonderful. and i think i would most definately pour out my feelings on here if i knew that matt was going to be the only one to read them...and i'm sure he's not, so i'm not going to, but he pretty mch already knows how I geel about him and all that. So there really isn't any point in doing it. (sorry if that doesn't make sense)  but i most definately LOVE matthew standridge, and most definately DON'T think he is a bad boyfriend!  -tori
