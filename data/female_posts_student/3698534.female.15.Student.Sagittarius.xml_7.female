Then I hear myself ask you  For one last goodnight kiss  As you lean down towards my face  A tear falls from my eye  I remember all we'd been through  Now I have to say good-bye  How rage flows through my veins  Just as your lips brush my cheek  You broke my heart in pieces  Now I see that I was weak  I've changed alot since then  Sometimes I still think of you  Now I dont feel love or hate  For the boy who broke my heart in two....:(  *WhY Do I BoThEr, WhY Do I CaRe, WhY Do I SeE YoU EvErYwHeRe...
