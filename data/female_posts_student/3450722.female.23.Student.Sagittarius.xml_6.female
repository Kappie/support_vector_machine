Actually, I love weddings... just sometimes it gets depressing remembering the "good ole days" of when these girls used to be wild. I remember Cheryl in Cancun and Wren in the Bahamas. Don't get me wrong, I"m extrememly happy for them. It all just seems to be happening at once. Oh, well. At least I know I won't have to go thru this until I"m 32. I don't know where I came up with that number, but I guess God told it to me in my dreams. The one thing I do love about weddings... open bar! Ha, ha. That's not the only thing. Both Cheryl and Wren both seem extrememly happy and I got to see so many of my friends and sorority sisters that I haven't seen in a really long time. The only thing that sucked about seeing them, was that all of them kept asking me what I was up to and why am I still in k-town! God... do you know how bad it sucked to tell them, that yes... I"m still here at UT working at good ole Buffalo Wild Wings! Oh well, only one more football season of making good tips!
