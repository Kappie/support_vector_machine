He kept talking about ex-girlfriends and shit and I stood there like, damn, I want a chance. Like some kind of carnival ride or something. Ah oh well.   And I started at the State / William Street Jimmy Johns yesterday from 11am-2pm. The guys are cool. Joe's (my boss) is really laid back. I don't know if that's because it was my first day or because he's always like that. I felt lazy for not doing anything, but when I asked if there was anything I should be doing he just said, 'nope,' and went back to work. Ok... I guess. The whole parking thing is a problem. I'm not paying $3-$9 for parking... not going to happen. I'll figure it out in the morning or something. Maybe I should start riding my bike to work from Mike's house or something. Like I said, I'll figure it out.  I worked at Provide.Net for a few. Didn't get much accomplished, but then again, I really don't care about that job. I went over to Michelle's afterward. We hung out for a few before I realized I was suppose to be at Monday Night Band Rehearsal. So I floored it to my house and talked with my mom for a few, got her to sign my tour papers and everything. Now I'm all set to go to Italy. I just need money for the trip (though my tour payments are completed).   I got out of that bullshit at 9pm and talked with Andee for a few minutes before heading back over to Michelle's house. Michelle and I headed over to William's house and I got completely plastered in front of Ned. I thought it was pretty hilarious if you ask me. We played a game of beer pong but I got so fucked up because he had 5 redemption. 5!! I think we scored a record or something. But when I went down stairs to call my dad, Michelle didn't make another redemption so we just decided to quit and go smoke a cigarette. Michelle drove my car back to my place and Josh said that he'd give her a ride home, so I gratefully accepted. When I got home I felt the inevitable, I was going to puke. So I headed to the upstairs bathroom to complete my task but Mike knocked on the front door, so I ran downstairs and let him in. Ran back upstairs, told him to chill in my room and tried to puke in the bathroom. No go. My mom came home, Mike and I ran into the basement. Tried to puke in the bathroom down there. No go. I came out and Josh was back by then. We walked back up a flight, and I ran into the bathroom by the kitchen, and all hell broke loose. I think I actually threw up part of my stomach or something. Bile is the most disgusting thing I've ever seen. I walked slowly back up to my room, Josh and Mike followed to make sure I got to bed okay. Josh said something to me, I can't really remember... but they left and I fell asleep.  I feel like such a bitch for getting that drunk. For making Michelle drive my car and get a ride from Josh. Making Josh drive Michelle home. Making Mike wait around for no apparent reason. Puking. Having the guys leave while I passed out on my bed. It was just all so fucked up. I'm not getting that drunk again any time soon.
