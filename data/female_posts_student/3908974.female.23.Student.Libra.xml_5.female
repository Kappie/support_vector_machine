I am a proud employee of the State of Kansas.  It's raining here today, so dull and depressing.  Kansas is such a pisser when the snow clears out.  Everything is either light brown or gray, save for all the gaily colored garbage strewn around.  I live in what's called the Student Ghetto here in Lawrence, but it's not really a ghetto.  Mostly it's just the children of middle class Kansans living on top of each other in slummy apartment complexes or crooked old houses.  I'm a senior this year, and I've kind of lost my flair.  Instead of getting dressed up all nice and combing my hair like I used to, I find that pajama pants are a comfortable alternative, and nobody looks at my hair anyways.   I ate eggrolls for breakfast and they're sitting in my stomach like a pile of rocks.  Later tonight I have my fiction class.  My major's Creative Writing.  Seems like a waste of time, considering the fact that most people become writers by actually writing instead of sitting around scratching their a-holes in workshops.  But Lord knows I need as much help as I can get, and if the university wants to give me three 500 level credits for writing stories, that's fine with me. I hope I get into graduate school.  I've applied all over, but the only one that's responded thus far is Minnesota State at Mankato.  I've never been to Minnesota, but it looks about like Kansas, from the pictures.  Maybe more trees, which would be a relief.  After graduate school, I want to go teach somewhere, and write books.  But sitting here at the computer in my pajamas and a raincoat, hopes like that seem far fetched.  My boss is coming...Must look busy.
