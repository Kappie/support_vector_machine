So yesterday some of us went to Brighton which were (if you didn't know) Me, Paul, Jackie, Matt W, Dave Edwards, Char, Jenna, Jenny and Sarah.  Was lots of fun, except I got burnt. Damm the sun. I also managed to get us a bit lost but the less said about that the better... Day before that I did teh Hard Rock Cafe and theatre with Paul and omg it rocked so much and we are so doing that in the summer Paul. I'm gonna take you to see Jailhouse Rock or something. :p  Today I shall spend it working. Right now I can't do any as all my books are wet with paint and will take a few hours to dry. Wopee!!!
