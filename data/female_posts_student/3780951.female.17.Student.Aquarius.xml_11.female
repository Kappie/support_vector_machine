I've closed a lot of chapters in my life this summer and started tons of new ones!! I met a wonderful new person and re-kindled an old best friend relationship. Cara and Jonathan are two of the coolest people I know. I mean, I know TONS of cool people. But these two people have been big this summer. Cara is an old friend from 1st grade. We were best friends for 7 years. Then all that came to a screeching halt when she went to a different school. We lost touch even though she was 15 min. away. But we always seem to get together during the holidays and summer. This summer was just special for some reason. Now Jonathan is my newest and dearest friend. Yes people, friend. LOL. But we've come to know each other a lot better this summer. Its fun hanging out with an old best friend and a new best friend!!  Well the summers almost over, i'm not going to waste it sitting here writing. I'll post more later. I gotta go talk to the beautiful rachael west!! holla!  Peace and Chicken - anna -
