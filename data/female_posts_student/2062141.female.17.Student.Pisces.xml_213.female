Mallorie and my mom took my car to go to the Gypsy Kings concert (wow... yeah... cool...) so I couldn't do anything tonight.. so I listened to music in my room for like 2 hours then watched TV for 2 hours.... and now I'm on the computer.. ga it feels like a SCHOOL NIGHT. Oh I had my first 6 hour art class today... 3 more to go... and GUESS who's the model... the same guy from last time. The same flamboyant skinny weird little man that I never wanted to see naked again. But somehow it happened. And he played the same wierd African-wannabe muzak. Well I guess only Ryan would know what I'm talking about but still. Oh and I'm by far the youngest person in the class, by about 10 years. Yeah. It said 17+, and I'm 17 so whatever! Mwahah and I'm better than most of them. I love that. Wow I'm a horrible person! Lol... um.. I'm gonna go now...
