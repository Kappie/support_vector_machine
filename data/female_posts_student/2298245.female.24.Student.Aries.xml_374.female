I could see, on the sidewalk up ahead, in between me and the entrance to the train - so there is no way to escape - the people from Greenpeace.  They are often on the sidewalks and in the parks, sounding their usual call, "Do you have a minute for Greenpeace?"  I should of course, have begun preparing my responses:     "Sorry, I'm in a hurry."   Or:   "Sorry, I hate the environment."   Or better yet:   "Sorry, I voted for George W. Bush."   The fact that none of those statements are particularly true does not diminish their value as a tool to irk.  It's not that I have anything particularly against Greepeace.  I've not had much of a problem with them, though I'm told some of their representatives can be particularly forceful in trying to get you to talk to them.  Mainly, they annoy me because they are standing on the sidewalk and a busy part of the day, taking up space and getting in the way, interrupting the free flow of traffic.    I, alas, made none of my witty responses.  I didn't think of them until later.  Instead, I just turned up my iPod, and started straight ahead, pretending I didn't hear.  Though, I did think to myself, "Sorry, I can't hear you.  I'm too busy listening to Frank."   "...Fly me to the moon..."   There are days when the moon sounds rather nice and appealing
