The view is amazing,  but now that I’ve had a taste I want more Not satiated Pinning Shadows dance on the wall taunting me I wish to follow  AND  Yet fear is there  Dark and ominous  Threatening to tear photograghs off the wall Rip pages out of my favorite story History dribbles from its teeth Perception hides under its dirty nails Lies unspoken hidden in its eyes  Courage now dear “nothing ventured— nothing gained” Adventure waits behind fear’s threats One step at a time Double or nothing  I’ll hold your hand
