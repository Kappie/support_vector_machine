I found myself at a party last night, wondering loose in a crowd of strangers, seeking some sort of connection, some moment where it would all fit for one achingly static moment. I was looking for everything and nothing, knowing I would come out on the other end in the rain on this Sunday evening. Staring at my computer screen, wondering what the hell I've spent the past week trying to find.
