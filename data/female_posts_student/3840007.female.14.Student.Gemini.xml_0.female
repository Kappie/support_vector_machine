We are good, if we keep our heads in the game and cover people lol. (Although it definitly is not the Centerfielder's job to cover right and left field..I mean..they are put there to cover..geez..oh well.) I read a book yesterday, I read a book the day before and I read a book the day before that. I read two Cathy Hopkins ones and one that was by Miss Francesca Lia Block. It is one of her best books, called the Hanged Man. It made me think A LOT and I think I need to read it again. Today I am reading another England girly books. I have become attached to them. Tomorow, I shall start reading my witchcraft books, one called Summer, and the other two from the Sweep series..which are amazing books. They are about this girl who didn't know she was a blood witch, and now she is practicing Magick and everything. I love wicca, I have learned so much from it. My mom yells at me when she sees me reading stuff about it..but I don't care. I think I have to go now..i've been rambling on and on and on about books ect. Well Catch ya on the flipside, keep rockin' in the free world, and blessed be..(and all your wishes mote them be!) Love, Shauna
