It is easier to type and it doesnt crash after jsut an hour on the net. it has a flat screen moniter and it has some really cool games on it like spider solitaire! and Pinball *remembers playing pinball instead of doing physics work LOL!*. are u going to anna's body shop party? how much money are you taking cos i have £15 in my purse but i'm not sure whether to get some more to take, cos i really dont think there is actually anything that i need this time!
