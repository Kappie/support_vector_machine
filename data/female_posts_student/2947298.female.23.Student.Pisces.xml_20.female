Saw yoga, went to VVA (first time ever), belly dancing, coffee house, rcore, WSAWSR and then drank martinis and chilled w/ the roomies and friends.  Was a very very active day and I liked it.  To bad it's still cold, but ATLEAST it is sunny.  Also had trouble speaking... I was thinking and speaking but there was no way I could prevent one or the other from coming out.  So I was thinking what I should be doing or about a conversation, and I would say a portion out loud while talking to whoever it was I was speaking with. So I ended up calling Ross Hubby, and I think I made a tons others.  It was my brian's off day I suppose.  Just hope not to many random people noticed... that sleep walking is a def. problem.  And now I'm at work! I had a day off class so I decided to cover for a co-worker, smart right, should have slept in...  So on with my story..... So this friend of mine from home is telling me over the phone his story of the time he went to D.C. to protest WTO (which is what rcore is doing) "So I walk into the cell and the cop is known by name to the 20 people that are there so I think 'regulars".  And when the cop leaves a Puerto Rican guy says, 'Another white boy, I'm gonna fuck you up.... nah I'm just kidding." A conversation begings and they ask why he's in there. 'I am in here for protesting  urlLink World Trade Organization , they said I assualted a police officer'. (he threw a bean bag that hit him and it by accident hit a cop that was clubbing him at the time). And the Puerto Rican guy, Pablo, says 'You got balls protesting,  you have a house and a job, wtf do you have to complain about'.  Good point my  friend notes, 'But I am protesting so we have more jobs, so everyone can have a job'. Pablo responds, 'Yeah they are jobs no one wants, what do you think?, like i would want to work in fucking  urlLink Bopal  !'. An obvious well educated guy who has more knowledge than the common college student. And they are in there for a while so might as well keep company... So later after talking to a few people and striking up a converstation about South Park Pablo says why he is in this lovely DC jail cell. 'Caught me for loitering brb..
