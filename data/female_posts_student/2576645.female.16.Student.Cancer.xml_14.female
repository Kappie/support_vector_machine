Despite how throughly stimulating Info Tech is (can't you just hear my voice dripping with sarcasm?) I am just sitting her waiting for that faithful moment when the bell rings and I increase my change of getting run over by some senior boy, obviously a little too excited to get the frist fries of the day. Which, by the way, I don't believe to be that good that you must run over some little freshman to get to....  AH! the bell rung!    Will someone help me up when Mr. Fry Man runs me down?   .....hahaha... that should be a country song!
