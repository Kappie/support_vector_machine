Because well...she REALLY can't spell! so ashley...FIND IT!   Anyways. i think i'm ready for my first time...that is first time actually posting a real post type thingy. ya know.   So this is Friday. And I am Tori. and here is Cassi. and we are hanging out. okay...now that we have the scene, we can tell the story.   Well Matt was gonna do something with his friends, and Paul never really called Cassi, so we decided to have a date. With the delectable three layer chocolate cake, with chocolate mousse, with chocolate sauce, and caramel sauce, and vanilla ice cream, and whipped cream, one big bowl, and two spoons, and two suicide lemonades calling our name...we headed to Ruby tuesday! :), and it was fun. ;) Lots of jokes came out of this evening. and well it's not OVERyet! hehe! so yeh, we got asked for our i.d.'s....we are SOOO NOT 21, I thought i was going crazy 'cause i saw a truck that Cassi DIDN'T see (Hi! This is Cassi, please understand that my view was blocked by a pillar...tori didn't realize this...quite humorous), and then this guy...who's actually QUITE creepy...came out of nowhere *yes there is a story about the creepiness, but it's not that good...so i just won't tell it! ;)* and then...there was this family...with the domineering mother..."LISTEN TO ME!" she says as she smacks the table...quite humorous again. and then the dad...boring. the little kid...boring. but then....there was the older kid...and the baby, and well. We thought the older kid was, well...retarded. cause he was trying to get the baby's attention, for something like a picture. So the baby's name was Hannah/Anna(not really sure!) and well the older kid was TOTALLY asking for WEENA!...i thought he was CrAzY. *he probably was!*   Then we decided...it was TIME TO GO! considering we were pretty sure the people around us were tired of us laughing, but considering it was the weirdo family(WEENA'S family*) i spose it was okay.   So we came to my house. and in the process of taking my sweatshirt off, the little plastic thing on the end of the string for the hoodie part decided it would GO UP MY NOSE! so obviously i ask it why "out of all the places you could go, why did you go up my nose!?" yet again Cass and i Laughed...and that was that. So now we are here...sitting, It's friday night. This is Tori, here is Cassi. and it's the same scene. Pretty exciting, but i'm sure that once i'm done with this...we'll end up laughing again. probably about how all the people that read this won't find it funny...really at all...but i spose you just had to be there. 'cause IT WAS!   Enjoy!   -tori
