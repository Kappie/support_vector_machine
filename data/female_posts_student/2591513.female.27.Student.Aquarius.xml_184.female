HAHA  Anyway, this was a  nice chill day,just gambled my coins away during a very nice and friendly match of mahjong.  Gotta love family.  Anyway, this is short and boring, I know.  I am going to get some rest.  I have to take Leila to school since Pa isn't done fixing Ed's piece of junk, oh I meant Civic.  haha  I can't believe Pa is leaving again.  I must admit we are going to really miss the guy, no matter how dorky or how corny he can be, we love him and miss him a lot when he is gone.  Have a great week everyone.  If I am not on here for awhile it is because we are trying to make the most of the time my dad has here.
