I only have one more day before school starts again.  Isn't that depressing? why yes, yes it is.  I have to finish a paper and do some extra credit tomorrow, which is unfortunate but I did procrastinate...so I have only myself to blame.  Hopefully I'll find something exciting to fill my time with tomorrow.
