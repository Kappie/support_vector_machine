She thinks that she's right all the time and she thinks that she smart everytime. She thinks that people will see the "perfectness" in her just because she read afew books about upgrading self-attitude. Alright, it seems to help her in her attitutes at times and did change her for a better person. However, books are not forever right or wrong! Books are not updated frequently and I hate her snatching the computer with me saying that I didnt allow her to use the computer and I was on purpose?! She didnt even tell me or ask me that she wanna use the computer, how do you expect I to know? So unfair to me and I felt so unhappy under her control of doing things that I dont like at NIGHT! She has hands and limbs, I'm sure she can do it too, right? Staring right behind my back as if she's watching the television and rudely turning low the volume of my speaker and order me to close the mp3 player? My god, I really dont like this kinda stuff, better get the hell outta here or else I will get a tight slap from her, bye  Sigh off, bLue`iCe
