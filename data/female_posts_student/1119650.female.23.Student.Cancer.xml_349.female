This was counteracted by a really stellar night out for some dinner at  urlLink Stir Crazy  followed by some rocking skee ball action at  urlLink Dave  Busters .  I also won a grover doll which is SO cute and I discovered I have enough tickets to win the television and the Atari.  Yes, the old skool awesome 1980's atari.  I want that mother!  It all was capped off by some innocent smooching in the parking lot with a very cute boy. (c:  Saturday: Yard work (feh!) with my mommy and then some shopping and some napping.  Then I headed down into the city with the Dapper Don,  urlLink Jon  and  urlLink Anna  for some yummy munchies at  urlLink Monster Sushi .  I will leave out the part how Jon, Don  I got lost in the 'hood of Brooklyn (BK, holla!).  Manhattan traffic sucks balls especially down by the Ferry.  Sunday: Much needed sleep, Megan's Birthday BBQ and some good old fashioned Carrie time on Sex In the City.  I am pooped right now and looking forward to hittin' the proverbial hay, but I have a feeling I'm gonna be up for a bit.  Why are weekends so short?!?!
