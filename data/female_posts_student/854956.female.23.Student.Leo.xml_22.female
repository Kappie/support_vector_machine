I'm not excited about the new semester, as I usually am.  On Monday, Wednesday, Friday I have TX Politics and Society at 10am... on Wednesdays I'll have one class (an Early Childhood class:  Play/Creativity/ Learning) in the afternoon from 2-4:45.  Then on Tues/Thurs I'll have 3 classes:  In the morning Education in American Society @ 9:30, World Lit since the 16th Century @ 11am;  then in the afternoon at the downtown campus I'll have Music and Related Arts @2pm (which I have to take for my major, and also since I need an easy class!).  The only light I see at the end of the tunnel is the fact that on Mondays and Fridays (the days I hate being at school the most) I will only have the one class.  But Tues-Thurs I won't be done till late in the afternoon... ARGH!  I just want to be DONE with school.  And to top it off, of COURSE I put off declaring my minor in music, so I can't count on taking a couple easy music courses.  Oh, well.  Next Fall... I'll be doing the symphonic band thing, and taking all my music classes, in addition to my other classes.  All will be fairly easy.  Finally I'll just get to have FUN in my classes and at school.  That'll be a nice change of pace!  I really only have like 4-5 really DIFFICULT classes left.  Anyhow, now I shall go to enjoy my weekend...!!!      urlLink  postCount('22Nov2002');
