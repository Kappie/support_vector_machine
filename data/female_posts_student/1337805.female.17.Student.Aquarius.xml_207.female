Hopped on a bus after school and went to see one of my favorite con people, Alex. We explored Victoria, around areas I've never been to before. It was wild. We talked for a while about all sorts of things. He's a very thought provoking person, he asks questions that make you think. But it was nice to talk to someone about CUC stuff, and too see what's going on in other districts and stuff. I loved it. He's still soooo cute, too, but now he's got the scruffy un-shaven look, which is dead sexy. He let his hair grow out again, which is awesome, cause he looks so much hotter with it longer. I'm glad I got to see him, I would have lost my mind, and now I really can't wait to see him, and San, and Erin, and Ellen and everyone else at Edmonton this year.   I royally fucked things up with Tom last night I think. Even though he was acting pretty cool today, like nothing happened,  like he does, I know something did. I can tell that it eats at him too. Last night we talked about his lonliness, and I told him about what Samaya said, and he was sorta shocked at that I guess. But like, I brought up about us, and how it was sorta a shame we "flung" in the summer, cause now we both want the same things, and Samaya's always right about these things....I've never seen her wrong. I know I freaked out Tom after that, cause he didn't talk, and then said he had to go... Nothing like me seeming desperate to kill a conversation, even though he was dying of lovelessness the entire conversation. I dunno. I just *love* ruining things for me. I would have to, because I seem to do it a lot.  The memories will always live inside my head, and I will cherish them. So don't waste your time on me, you're already a voice inside my head (I miss you...)
