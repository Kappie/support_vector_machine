This is top of the line, 5 star hotel vacuum. it comes with a hepa filter, a mini vaccuum thingy, dirt sensor (with red and green light for easy reading *insert awes here*), also has dual side sweepers and add attachments, plus its purple. this is like the vaccum from above. it puts all vacuums to shame. now, because this vacuum is heavenly, my mom has made it a need to have every room vacuumed to perfection. i'm hoping she'll get over it soon.  Pea-Pin is opening for real tomorrow. i'm really excited. C.J finally knows his lines and the whole play seems to have come together. except for the war scene. goll i suck at the part but life goes on. today i played the part of Catherine for the lovely Liona, who is currently at state speech. go her! it was interesting but i think i did alright. i don't exactly have the range but i managed. *sigh* someday i'll have a lead...*dreamy wondering*...maybe.  Other news, I got an A on the US Lit assignment from hell. i'm pumped! i'm pretty sure i made up half of the report the night before at around 1 am. oh well he thinks i understood what i was doing. wah ha ha! fooled again!  But now i have enormous amounts of homework to do and read a book by the end of this week. but p.s - i found The Kitchen Boy at my local library. I'm pumped! so i'm going to read that as soon as i'm done with Farhenheit 451. *sigh* it doesn't help that i don't have time to do half the things that i'm doing.  On the sixth day of Christmas, my true love ran away, -Betso
