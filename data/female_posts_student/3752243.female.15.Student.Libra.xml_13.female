I just wanted to let you know why I changed the name of the blog and all the settings and such. Well I changed the name because I have a wierd obsession with Argile sweaters, and well frankly I wanted my blog to reflect that. I changed the settings to the pink thing, because, I thought it looked like my blog had the measels. Now I don't want to have the measels, so why would I want my blog to have it, that is just mean! So now I will critique. Romones. Gabba Gabba Hey. They are PUNK LEGENDS. That is all I have to say about that. I must be going.Hoccha Author:Eve
