Finally don't have to worry about someone else desperate to use the bathroom.  Luiz came back at about 10:30 and at 11am Matt phoned asking if I was indeed coming to Escola Tecnica today. Said yes, and that I'd see him in half an hour. Luiz drove me to the school and I got there 20mins early...hehe, takes much longer by bus. Met up with Nathan briefly who asked if I could get into the school okay (security) told him Matt was coming to get me, and he said something along the lines of, "Guy's got my fucking hat." Heh. So, to kill time, I went for a walk down the the bank to see if the ATM's there'd accept my card. I'm broke...only $16R left...So, it figures that they didn't accept my card so I wandered back 10 mins later and kept myself occupied with my Rubik's cube. Matt surprised me, and then surprised me even more when I saw it wasn't a baseball hat he'd stolen from Nathan, like I'd originally assumed, it was some sort of Cowboy hat...I think. LOL, cool.  The convo class was cool. Some South African chick named Pauline showed up, (not an exchanger, like a backpacker...sorta...well, not really. She's traveled a fair bit) and she was really interesting to talk to. Caught the bus home (I took a bus. By myself. And didn't get lost. Willeke! Aren't you so proud of me? hehehe)  Tried another bank before going home. Now only have $14.50 R left. Stupid bus fare. Ate lunch, wrote in my diary....chatted on MSN, then watched Gilmore Girls and Touched by an Angel. LOL, I can follow along now nearly. My eyes drift towards the titles (even though the show is in english) and I can normally managed to follow just by reading. I try and figure out what's being said before the actor actually says it. If that made any sense whatsoever...LOL.  Matt and I were supposed to be doing something tonight, but he came online saying that he was sorry and was going to go to bed instead. *blinks* Not even 6 yet. I asked him what's wrong but he said he was just tired. Hopefully that's only it...6...lol. Ah well. ^_^  So, it's just me, myself and I this evening....hm...what shall I do?  Dum dum dum....;-)  Beijos!
