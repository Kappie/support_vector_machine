I got a spiffy mechanical pencil to write with while I was blowing my money, so I wouldn't be without a handy dandy writing tool. I hope the writing class goes well, I mean, I'm not all that good at english and I have never taken a good crack at poetry. This could be a dilemma- the author dude man is a poet! Ahhhh I hope everything goes ok. Maybe I can sit in the back and not be noticed. I highly doubt that's possible though, maybe he will find the star student and ask them all the questions. Either way, I have to go to the class. I told my mother when she suggested the idea, "Hey that sounds ok." Now I'm thinking, "Crap! What have I gotten myself into!"    It's not that I don't like poems  I love poems. I just can't write them very well. O sure I've had my crack at poems. I wrote one for a friend once. I poured my heart out into it to try to make him see how he was making me feel. He didn't even read the poem. I deleted it.   So, I'm a little nervous  Other than that I am ok.     Chow ma!
