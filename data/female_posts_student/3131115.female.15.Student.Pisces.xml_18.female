I didnt write yesterday, and I'm not sure if I did saturday or not. Hmm...I dont think that I did. So, breakfast was boring. I had nobody to talk to..as usual. I went to Bills after that, and then Ashleys. hehe..I had a good time there. I love hanging out with Ashley.   "you got served" err...sorry, that was random just thought of it.   Greg took Nibby to that ladies house to get help for a month or two. I'm alright with it...I just hope that I get ...*HER* back. Yepp, yesterday we found out that Nibby is a girl. I'm thinking about changing her name since she is a girl...maybe Nitosha instead of Niblikitosh...or even tosha or something. err, I might even keep her name Nibby.   Things are going okay..and I dont know what else to say, really...err umm *blah*  Leaving now...    -Is there anybody out there?!?-
