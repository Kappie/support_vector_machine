It'd be weird having a romantic relationship with him. And he doesn't want that either. We're best friends, why ruin anything? But I still don't think him and Erin going out would be a great idea. For one, I'd be pretty ticked off because then I couldn't be the same with Kyle that I am now. I wouldn't be able to kiss him or hug him or just be close with him anymore. And maybe that's selfish, but I don't care. He was my friend in the first place. And I realize that they probably will go out, but I'll see what happens when and if that comes. I love Kyle and I never ever want to lose him and he will always be my best friend.  I still haven't spoken to Erin, I don't really know how long it's been, but I really don't care.   I'm happier than I've been in a long time. I'm happier than I ever thought I could be and I love it. Because you see, for the first time in about 5 months, I don't feel ditched or jealous or out of place. I just feel that what I have with Kyle is right. And I wouldn't change it for a thing. I finally think I have my life exactly how I want it right now.
