Here's what's happened lately:  Greg's last day at Steubing was yesterday.  :'(  I'm going to miss him, but I pick up snack every Tuesday, so I'll see him all the time.  Now, last week he had pulled me aside and said that he talked to Vicky Dawson, our program director, and recommended me for the Primary Manager of the site.  So, last week and this week he's been having me make phone calls to inquire about absences, setting up parent's corner, staying inside alone without him and running the cafeteria, etc.  Well, so we didn't know what was going to happen with Heather, because, she's on probation for losing a child, and we didn't know if she would be demoted, terminated, or what.  Well, Tuesday she comes into work and says, "Guess what?!?!  I'm going to be Greg's successor!"  Kristen and I just looked at each other... and I told Kristen when Heather was gone that I was probably going to be putting in my two weeks because I couldn't stay there with her in charge.  I also said I didn't want to risk her losing a child, or getting in trouble (because she yells... a LOT) since I would be going for my certification in about 2 years, and didn't want anything on my record.  Okay... so... Chris said he was going to go and talk to Vicky because he didn't understand how someone who was on probation... who many of us thought would be demoted or terminated... could be promoted.  Well, he went and talked to them yesterday, because Wednesday was an absolute NIGHTMARE.  Greg let Heather have a taste of what was in store for her, and she TOTALLY f***ed up the fire drill that she was in charge of.  She also then yelled, VERY LOUDLY, at the children while we were outside.  Now, isn't that what Greg got in trouble for about a month ago???  And it was a NON-A.S.K. parent who reported it to several people in the district and at SAUM???  Yeah.  Chris also mentioned that none of us would stay, and that we'd probably all be putting in our 2 weeks shortly.... Because Kristen, Angela, and Trish said they were going to leave if she was in charge.  Well, so, Henry was at this meeting with Vicky as well... and he told Chris he'd take care of it and that he'd be out at the site later that day.  Well, here he came to the site around 5:15... and he pulled me aside and asked me what had happened Weds.  I told him what happened... and I also said I knew about her probation because she told me, and that I wouldn't stay there with her in charge because I didn't trust her to do the job correctly.  I explained my fear of things trickling downstream from things she messed up and it effecting my teaching career.... and he understood.  He then said, "I realized I made a mistake in telling her to be primary when I was out in the hallway outside the closed cafeteria doors and could hear her voice all the way out there.  We can't have that going on."  So, long story short, I'll be in charge of the site on Monday.  It should be interesting... especially since I have NO idea what Heather did with the attendance roster for next week.  Great.  I'll figure it out and all will be okay.  At least this way we won't lose the rest of our employees.  Wish me luck... I'll need it!
