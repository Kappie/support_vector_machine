Whether it was the support I felt from a close friend or the beautiful day or if it was the fact that I got paid to run errands for almost two hours yesterday, I couldn't tell you. It could even perhaps be that the roommate that is a hellish bitch is moving out all of her stuff tonight and tonight will be her last night at the apartment.   And this morning, I did one of my favorite things.....I went shopping for presents. My friend L. is getting herMasters this Friday and I picked up a gift for her. Like most girls, I love shopping but its the most rewarding when I'm shopping for gifts for other people. I just imagine what their reaction would be to whatever it is that I'm buying and that is more satisfying than blowing hundreds of dollars on new shoes. And I love shopping in advance. I haven't yet found the perfect gift for my mothers birthday in about a week but I have found the perfect gift for a very cute and devilish little girl, whose birthday is in September. Her mother, and one of my best friends, will be pleased that this gift makes no noise on its own. :)   For this reason, shopping for others is therapy for me. It soothes away problems. I know to some this may seem awfully strange. But I believe that the most infectious thing on Earth is a smile. And if I can make someone smile or even make their day, others that I do not even know may be positively affected by my act of kindness.
