Yes, I know. I'm anal retentive. I'm almost done updating all pertinent song information and after that's done, I can get started checking to see if the songs are all okay.  I suppose I could just upload songs and then delete songs as necessary if I find out they aren't really quality. Okay, maybe I'll do that. Maybe then I can get cracking on that Excel spreadsheet I'm supposed to put together for work.
