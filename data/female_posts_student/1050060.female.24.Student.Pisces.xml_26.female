There is some people i will tell a lot more to then others. I think everyone close to me would get a really kick out of it. It is just so crazy why do i get in this shit. Why me? Now that i think about it. It is just too funny.   Humans can be so confusing and stupid at the same time. I have to say i was that kind of human for the last 2 days. But the good thing is that i am learning so much about myself. Which i think is a good thing. Some thing that i really was not thinking about in a long time.   I know for sure that Brandi and i will be friends for life. Because of all the shit that has happened in the last two days and we haven't yelled at each other is a great sign. Love you Brandi, your like the sister to me. Well that is all for now. Have a good day. Hopefully better then mine.
