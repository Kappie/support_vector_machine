IT WAS BIG AND RED AND HAD A HOTTTT COWBOY INSIDE!HAHA, I LOVED IT. SO ANYWAYS, THIS MORNING I WOKE UP EARLY AND RAN ERRANDS WITH KELLI. THEN WE CAME HOME AND CLEANED CAUSE MY MOM AND LITTLE BROTHER WERE COMING HOME FROM WYOMING. ME, KELLI, MATT AND KRISTIN WENT TO PICK THEM UP FROM THE AIR PORT ((IT'S YOUR DADDY!! FUNNIEST THING EVER!!)) THEN WE WENT OUT TO EAT AT SOME MEXICAN FOOD PLACE ON BANDERA RD. AND I SAW A HOTT GUY THERE THAT LOOKED LIKE BRAD FROM THE REAL WORLD. HAHA, YEAH. HOTTTT.
