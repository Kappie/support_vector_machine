HMM...?  whenever u feel like dying just think about how you would really hurt ppl that care about you.  If you die, my life would be happy.  Meaning that you should not die or your most hated thought will come true :D Killing yourself is the coward's way out of life.  In fact, life is a journey, a test.  How long can you survive?  How long can you go on like this?  How long can you take the pain of life until you want to just drop dead and get it over with?  Life has bad points and i know that.  But... All lives also have happy parts like your first kiss, first date, grads, 100% tests *sigh*, once in a lifetime experiences and just having fun.  The longer your life goes on, yes, the more sad things will happen yet there will always be more happier thoughts.  Just be patient.  All lives end the same way.  Death.  Just wait and your time will come but enjoy life and its gifts for now.  Remember, Life isnt the only part of the journey, but death as well.  Struggle, sweat, work.  Never give up.  Because, if you keep on trying something good will happen, if you give up, you have no chance, period.
