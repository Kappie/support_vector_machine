This song doesn't mean anything in special for me but I know someone to who this song probably means something…  I'm kinda bored again.   My nick on Msn is kinda suggestive. "Spend ur LaZy…eNdLeSs…cRaZy days inside my bEd…oOpS, inside my hEaD!" It looks like I'm some kind of whore. Spend ur days inside my bed…yeah, it sounds bad. Maybe I should change my nick to another not so…u know. Lol…I only say shit. I must stop with this…right now.  WORD OF THE DAY --> Sticker.       Stickers are cool. u can put stickers on your wall if it's ugly or...u can just glue them to somebody's forehead...yeah, stickers are something kinda useless but they're cool....*sighs* i gotta stop with these things...my thoughts are always stuff like this...*hits head on the wall*  ***take care***
