I basically entails giving up meat, but making some exceptions for fish and poultry. And there will be no giving up of eggs or dairy, as neither of us is really into that. I'm all for only getting free-range, super organic stuff too, and I'm sure that will limit intake due to cost. The main goal is to dramatically increase consumption of fruit and vegetables, and to make those kinds of foods the main source of calories. I'm looking forward to it, because I think it'll be good for me. And it'll be easier to turn down meat that seems questionable in origin. My only worry is giving up bacon, which holds a special place in my Saturday morning breakfast itinerary.   You may have wondered about the nature of the title above. As you all may know, Davis is a bike town, and I don't mean harleys. I've been riding my bike to school with no problems all school year, even in torrential rains, and freezing fog. But my eyes must have been dazzled by the sun on this first nice school day of winter quarter, because I finally had a bike inflicted injury. I'm riding along, minding my own business, and in the course of avoiding people, I run over some of those yellow bump things on the side of the traffic circle. I totally bit it. I land on my knee, everyone around me stops and looks at me and I leap up and say, "I'm okay!" as reassuringly as I can. I roll up my newly torn pant leg, assess the damage, and limp towards the bike racks. I wanted to cry, but worked really hard to maintain control. My knee is tore up. It bled all through class, and then I gingerly rode home, terrified I might do something dumb again. But I made it home, washed my knee and changed. I took the bus to my later class, and inspired by Liz's example, I walked back. It was all very nice, but damn my knee hurts. It's super bruised. I mean to post a picture of it tonight if I can figure out my camera phone thing.   Also, I'm freaking out about all of these damned papers I need to write. I'm going to see how much I can skim the book for Russian history, and then I'll write out a strictly structured paper about Viet Nam. I'm sure I'll whine a lot about it here, so hopefully all will be well. Okay, I need to outline both papers tonight and see how much I can get written ahead of time. It would be amazing to get enough sleep before the due date of a paper.
