Its cool how hes the only person that reads this besides Nick (nothing against either of them because they're cooler than an eskimo in a whip cream bikini....or something....) You know I enjoy being a big loser waste of life kid. I love it like I love bleeding out my mouth after being hit in the face by Amy's water bottle. Really. Its quite fun. You should try it sometime.
