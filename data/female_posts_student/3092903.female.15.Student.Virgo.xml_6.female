She called me earlier today and told me about this dream she had, and she said it was the scariest, most awful dream ever about me dying and everyone was at my funeral. she said the eulogy about how i didnt believe in borders in life, and no matter where i was at that momment, i was everywhere because i had no limits. crazy stuff..i think the dream is symbolic of us growing apart these past few weeks. okay, now i'm off the phone. but anyway, back to what i was saying, when sara came to hang out the other night, i realized how much i missed her being around all the time. It's so much fun being crazy when Sara's around.            I officially started back on the Erin Diet today. For some reason, it makes me feel better when i do without as much food, than just bein able to eat what i want. I guess I needed a couple of weeks to enjoy myself, but I definately lost sight of the goal. BUt I'm not beating myself up or anything because I'm not at the weight I wanted to be at this momment, because I think losing as much weight as I have in the past year is pretty impressive. So, I'm just going to watch it like I was before and do and hour of cardio everyday, and weights when I can get to the gym, and I think that will help me get back into the swing of things.
