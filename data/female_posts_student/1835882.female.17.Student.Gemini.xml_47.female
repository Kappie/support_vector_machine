I learned that some people who i thought couldnt sing could actually really sing. The pie was good i guess  uhm, this weekend well actually tomorrow is the FIRST real race at KNOXVILLE! i just hope it doesnt get rained out or anything. Skip's Car Is looking GOOD! ok well ima gonna add a link to my "raceblog" and maybe to hannah's since i was checking out chads and he posted that she had one so i went and read a few entires pretty interesting and uhm yeah but right now  i need to go and clean out the litter box....aww i dont want to.....its really icky when tiger decides she wants to use it as im cleaning it out and so i have to switch and do the other one. yes we have 2 litter boxes....and 2 kittens actually they're not all that small anymore...ok i know that was just way to much info but if you know me when i talk its hard for me to stop so ok i really need to stop typing and go. if i remember which i doubt b/c im so forgetful i'll post or well add to this later but all that i'll remember is to add links and stuff.  ok im leaving NOW!
