It started out a normal day... except that it was quite windy... orchestra and pottery went on as usual (gotta put 1000 coats of clear glaze on my Matrioshka doll! 990 to go....) but then third period the lights go out... which is not too phenomenally uncommon... but still exciting and hopeful...  after a fun 3rd period of darkness rocking out to 80s songs with Matt Hill and Justin Boggs... then after a dark period in the library and a darker lunch, Stubrud's on the intercom at noon telling us schools out at 12:15... a collective hollering is heard in the darkened Hazen halls... a triumphant moment in Mrs. Altman's 5 period honors class. I'm in ecstasy. I don't know why, it just seemed in retrospect a horrible unbearable thing to have finish the school day. Josh's power was out, as was mine until about an hour ago, so we sat downstairs by his old fireplace and plugged a CD player into a computer speaker and listened to Christmas music, talking about our Christmas memories and played a game of Life (BIH) which I won (6!!!) hehe... it was so nice, sitting there on the floor burning my butt by the fire. lol. Put me in the Christmas mood :) .  Then when I drove Nick home and we yelled at insolent middle schoolers.... lol. Later, as my house is big and scary when the lights are out, and we were about to resort to cooking chicken soup over the fireplace, we decided to go get pizza in downtown Renton and see Haunted Mansion (it's very strange... i'm not sure I liked it..). I got home at 9 and here I am talking to you. Or myself. Or whatever.
