When in fact my concern with the age, is not the age itself, yet what is represents to me. I remember, as do most, being an adolescent not being able to fathom ever turning twenty, let alone twenty-five. As I grew older, I knew this day would come, although I thought I would be more prepared. Perhaps as I have aged my ideal of myself has not. Could I still young at heart, even though some days I feel a million years old? I notice changes in myself as time passes, some physically but most mentally. I’ve taken some of my childhood qualities into adulthood, and some left behind. These become obvious to me when I am remembered for a quality that I no longer possess.  However, it is not this that worries me about turning twenty-five, rather I keep coming back to a conversation my father and I had one New Year’s Eve. I remember the look in his eyes, and the terror in my heart, for if what he was saying was true; in front of me lie a lifetime of confusion. He said that he felt every monumental age came with a life crisis of sorts. That perhaps he did not agree with only mid-life crisis, but that it happened about every 10 years or so. One reflects on their life and changes it appropriately and prepares for the upcoming years. Possibly even changing direction on a current path, or goal. Could this be possible? Am I destined to re-evaluate myself every 10 years or so? This thought making me reflect on my life choices. I chose to take longer with school, it took me awhile to choose a degree path, and even now I sometimes become hesitant. I think about my friends and their paths, some of them seem so mature compared to mine. They are embarking on marriage, parenting, or buying their first new house. Then I think about my mom when she was twenty-five, she was already a parent. A life I cannot imagine, not out of lack of respect, rather my own lack of responsibility. I admire those people, like my mom, who were basically grown-ups by my age. I’m barely getting close to adulthood, despite my age. Although some might call me lucky, sometimes I still feel stuck in between an age group. Not a kid, not quite an adult.  So, if this theory of my fathers is true, we’ve all felt this way. Although this doesn’t make me feel less alone, as it should, just makes me feel a bit sillier for making such a damn big deal out of it.
