I don't have any homework and Chelsea asked me to go see a show at the something theater.  Can't remember.  But I bet my parents will say no.  You know why, because they wouldn't let my sister go out last Sunday night.  But don't they always give you that crap about how you have more responsibilities because you're older and that you get more privledges also.  Well, please tell me when does that come into effect?  When we move out for college, "Oh by the way you can go out with your friends now."  Yeah that was crap, I know.  Well, anywho I have to go ask my dad.
