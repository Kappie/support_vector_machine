This, after all, was the year that I completely and fully turned my life over to the Lord.  I died, but was born again in Christ.  "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!" 2 Corinthians 5  Is it any surprise, then, that my birthday this year was the day after Christ died and the day before His resurrection?  Exactly when death was defeated through Him that died on the Cross?  God has some strange yet beautiful and perfect planning, I must say.  By the way--Happy Easter, everyone ;-)
