I went to Gurnee, IL. to Six Flags and Gurnee Mills with my mom, bro and Raeven. We had a blast (spending money just seems to fill the loneliness in my life... hmm). I had my encounter with Justin when I got back from Gurnee, Friday afternoon. DAMN that boy is fine. *sigh* The rest is secret. I've been talking to Paul a lot recently, and I seem to miss him. Maybe not him, but the way he used to treat me. He's always telling me I need a man who treats me like a princess, nothing less. And to tell you (whoever the hell "you" is) the truth, he was always sweet to me. I mean, within the short time we were unoffically "together" last fall, he was a gentleman (to my face). He surprised me by showing up on my doorstep one night (he had told me he would still be in Indiana; working), took me shopping... anything I wanted, he took care of. He later admitted to fooling around with other girls, but I like honest guys, so I didn't take it hard. Over a half a year later, here we are, becoming close friends. It's nice and all, but he's now in Oklahoma. Not only that, but I don't think I ever lost feelings for him. I mean, my feelings were never very STRONG, but for the given time I had with him... they were. The whole time we didn't talk after the sudden ignoring of each other... I would think of him. Not every night; just once in awhile when I'd get upset and think about how shitting people tend to treat me. He'd always stick out and I'd always have to tell myself, "You're an idiot for keeping him out of your life, he treated you like you're actually something amazing... which you're not." At times I can look at myself in the mirror and see a beautiful blonde, with amazing blue eyes, a great figure and an amazing smile; rare though. Almost everyday, I really see a pathedic excuse of a life. Gray eyes, a thick coat of fake blonde (or is it yellow?) hair, fat, and flat chested. But those days that I actually feel beautiful, I dream about modeling, though I know it could never happen. Mostly with my attitude, or should we call it "self-esteem"? Whatever that is. You're your own worst critic... but I honestly try to see the good in me. I see nothing.
