You know our love was meant to be The kind of love that lasts forever And I want you here with me From tonight until the end of time  You should know everywhere I go You're always on my mind, in my heart, in my soul Baby, you're the meaning in my life, you're the inspiration You bring feeling to my life  You're the inspiration I wanna have you near me I wanna have you hear me say it No one seeds you more than I need you  And I know that it's plain to see We're so in love when we're together Now I know that I need you here with me From tonight until the end of time You should know everywhere I go, you're always on my mind, in my heart, in my soul  You're the meaning in my life You're the inspiration You bring feeling to my life  You're the inspiration  I wanna have you near me  I wanna have you hear me say it No one needs you needs you more than I No one needs you more than I  I wanna have you near me  I wanna have you hear me say it No one needs you more than I need you  You're the meaning in my life  You're the inspiration,  You bring feeling to my life You're the inspiration  When you love somebody to the end of time When you love somebody, always on my mind  No one needs you more than I  When you love somebody to the end of time When you love somebody, always on my mind  Ah, what an 80's song and yet...I sadly love it.
