I've been the opposite of very busy with the exception of work which has just been hellish this week.  I'm growing increasingly disgusting with my mundane Gainesville existence, and yet I'm at the point where I can't even afford to escape it.  The option of moving home is looking less and less tempting, I think that would only make me more insane.  I know that God has a plan, and that I should just sit here and let that happen, but...  Going to DC last week was perhaps the worst decision I've made in a while. Now that I know what's out there, it's hard to be even remotely happy here.  Still waiting on decent sleep and play...blech.  I'm so whiny lately...it's very very difficult for ME to feel more whiny than usual, eh?  Here's something to ponder whilst I wallow in self-pity: Why does the inside of the SoBe drink cap say "Drain the Lizard?  "
