The story was great and filled with lots of excitment and some laughter. The overallplot is a son is upset with his father who lay dying that he doesn't know anything about him because his whole life has been lies. Well you get to see some stories of the father and you really get in touch with the son's feelings. Its really a great movie in my perspective.   Next movie Honey I give it *** out of 5 stars It was a cute movie. With great dance moves and an okay plot. Jessica Alba was good but Mekhi Phifer got shorted on his part. Such a great actor deserved more. The great dancing kept this movie afloat. Overall plot: Honey Daniels (Alba) is a bartender/record store worker who wants to be a dancer. She gets spotted dancing at the club she works at, gets a job and ends up having a crappy boss. With some twists and heartwarming stuff this movie is not too bad. Guys will like all the scantily clad booty shaking, girls will like the story.    Next movie Love Don't Cost A Thing I give it * out of 5 stars Starring Nick Cannon(Drumline) and Christina Milian (recording artist) it was below average. The plot was recycled, and badly at that. Advertised as comedic and a love story it was barely either. Nick Cannon came off as annoying, Christina as a bitch. It was pathetic and a waste of 4 dollars to rent it.   Next movie Along Came Polly I give it *** out of 5 stars Starring Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston this movie was a disappointment. It was hyped up as funny and it was pathetic. The only thing that saved this movie from Gigli status was Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the pathetic has-been movie star and Hank Azaria as the french nudist. Its worth seeing but wasn't as funny as I'd hoped.
