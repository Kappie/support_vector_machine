So I'm here chilling with Daniel and Andrew. We are watching friends... can u tell that we dont have much to do? Hehe... O btw! I read the Scarlet Letter! It's not my summer reading book, but I wanted to read it anyway and it is good. Not the happiest of books, but it's still good! My summer reading for the Academy is Fast Food Nation. It's alright. It's fairly interesting like how all the founders of fast food restaurants had no education. They were basically all drop outs yet they made billions. What a funny little world we live in. But I'm not a huge fan of fast food anyway. Well, anyways, I'll be back in 5 days! So everyone try not to miss me tooo much! hehe.. tootles!!!  "I've been rejected...twice!"
