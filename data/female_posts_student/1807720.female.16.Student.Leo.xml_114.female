I hate thinking I aced something and then I find out that I didn't.  Today was really good though.  I finished social and religion and I STUDIED alot for chem.  I feel real ready for the test tommorow.  I just know I know this stuff.  I studied and practiced too much to do bad on this.  I KNOW in my mind that I can do good on this.
