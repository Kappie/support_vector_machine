I will also be posting my new poetry and story works on here. Ill try to update as often as possible, which wont be that often. Anyways, I have a MAJOR headachso I am going to go now.   P.S- just so all of you know, im NOT posting about anything that happens in my personal life, but if i sound pissed off then just talk to me about it, but its going to be really hard to see what i really am this year. No one is getting in. Thanks.
