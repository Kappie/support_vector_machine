We have to blab on about the stupid (ok then cool) zigganought thing! so far:  Zigganout - the flawless hero alien person  The Silent Carrot - When spoken to, nods or shakes head or uses vague sign language, never says a word ar changes expression. Everyone refers to him as Him. You write the rest - i have to go.
