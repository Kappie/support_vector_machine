Now that just had tragedy all over the place. 1st he gets captured then he escapes. After he escapes he gets REcaptured and falls in love with that pretty little horse Rain. Then Rain  falls over the side of a waterfall AND DIES!  After that, he's taken (he got captured AGAIN!!!) to pull a train over a mountain so they can run a railroad into his old home. Luckliy he survives  and discovers Rain has survived as well. Now, they run off into the sunset back to his homeland. That scene gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling inside the entire time I watch it. Did I mention that soundtrack ROCKS.  Next, we have Mulan. (I'm planning on making this my layout once I get a chance to)That soundtrack also rocks, I still love refelection to this day!!! Now, that was sad when she realized that her father would die if she went to war. So she cuts off most of her hair, dawns his armor and runs off for the armor. After she does that her father runs after her in the rain and falls. It was SAD!!!  Then there was Nemo. If you haven't seen Nemo yet, go!!! Go see it!!! The poor fish got fishnapped!!! NNNEEEMMMOOOO!!!  And, the all time SADDEST and BEST animated movie, the Lion King. I still can't believe they killed Mufasa. I cried the first time I saw that.  He was such a cool lion. And the way he died suck. Screw you Scar, SCREW you!!!!!  I loved Mufasa!  Now that I think about it....animated movies seemed to be much to sad for children. Just, to damn sad for the poor little picknees
