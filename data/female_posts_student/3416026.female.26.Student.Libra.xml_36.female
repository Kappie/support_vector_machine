During my senior year in high school I took Zoology instead of Physics because I heard it was a reprise of 10th grade biology and would be a snap to pass. Those rumors were true, for sure.  I can label abdomens and thoraxes like a mother!  I wish I would have taken Physics, though.  Studying art has helped me appreciate science (and math) like I never did before.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that some kinds of science and math are actually art, in and of themselves.   urlLink Stuart Davis  doesn't have the market cornered on nutty abstractions.    This is where the fabulous   urlLink SEED Magazine  comes in.  Should you be interested in arm-chair -- but not flaky-- current events in science and culture, check it out.  The fall issue featured  urlLink Physics pretty-boy Brian Greene , the go-to guy for  urlLink string theory , and author of a little book called  urlLink The Elegant Universe .  My friend Emily is engaged to a Nuclear Physics Ph.D. (despite my encouragement that she  urlLink trade up  to someone a skosh more intellectual).  I cornered her doctah at a social event recently and asked whether, within his community, Brian Greene is to Physics scholars what  urlLink Dr. Phil  is to real doctors.  Luckily, though he reminded me that "String theory is still just a theory," Greene is the real deal.  SEED is not all about string theory though.  I read the fall 2003 issue cover-to-cover and neither felt confused, nor like I was swallowing dumbed-down content.  It only comes out 6 times a year... so they say... and I just got the most recent issue. Yall should too.  You can couple it with your US Weekly if that makes you feel better.
