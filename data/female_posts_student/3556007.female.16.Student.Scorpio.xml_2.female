I didn't even know who he was or anything, and I had never seen him before save one time. I was in PreCal, doing my work, and I looked up. There was this guy (who I had never even heard talk) staring at me. I figured that I was probably making a weird face or something while I was trying my hardest not to fail this quiz, but I caught him doing it about 3 more times within the next two weeks. I thought that he was pretty cute, but I wasn't going to talk to him. I had never heard him talk in class and I was only 3 seats behind him. If he wasn't a nerd or a freak he would have tried to join in on the conversation when I was talking to Kaitlin or something (she sits right behind him). Anyways, one day at lunch I was talking to Carolyn, and she was like, "Do you know Hunter?" But I had no idea at all who it was, so I told her no. Then she described him to me, and I remembered, so I was like "Yeah, I've seen him staring at me a few times." And I started wondering why she had brought this up, and how she knew him... Then she told me "He thinks your hot" and I was thinking all sorts of crazy shit... I don't even know. I just kind of sat there for a second, stunned. She explained that he had just moved from Egypt that past summer, and that he didn't really know that many people. That was why he was so shy. Well, in PreCal, it ended up being me that was staring at him for the majority of the class period. I never introduced myself or anything b/c it would just be weird. I mean, what are you going to say to someone that you don't even know? I guess I could have been like "Whoa, I did soo bad on that one quiz... blah blah!" and started a conversation, but I hate rejection. So, I didn't. Well, one day all of a sudden I was at church and Jessica our youth director was like "Hey there is this new kid, Hunter. You should go talk to him." And so I went and I talked a bit, but he was really quiet, but I don't blame him. It was a good thing, though, because otherwise I would have thought that he was annoying or something. So I started talking to him, and then we talked at school, too. It turns out that he is also in Ellen's English class. Now I don't know how it started, but one day a week or two ago he asked for my number, and I gave him my cell. Now we talk every night even though he has a girl friend. He really likes her a lot, but he thinks that she is going to break up with him soon for a bunch of stupid reasons. Part of me wants him to break up with her, but then again, I like our relationship now. There is absolutely no pressure. We can say whatever we want to eachother and stuff. Well, on Sunday was my birthday, but his birthday was 6 days earlier, so on Saturday he had a kind of get together at his house. I started to walk there when it began raining. Then I called him and got one of his friends to pick me up even though I was soaking wet. I bought Hunter the Donnie Darko DVD because me and Ellen are always talking about it at church and he is like "What are y'all talking about?" So yeah... And he watched it with his friends and he said that it was really cool. So then, he was like "I am getting you something for your bday," but I told him not to worry about it. Then, this Wednesday night, it was movie night at youth group. I went with Ellen to Kroger earlier so that we could buy a bunch of food. When I got there, Ellen was like "I have a secret that I know, but I can't tell you." And I thought that it was something bad like that she had to work all this weekend again. But, when we got to church, it turned out that Hunter had flowers for me for my birthday! Then, for the movie we watched Goundhog's Day which was good because part of it was a love movie. Then, Matt drives me home every Wednesday night, and Hunter sees this. I think that it is good for both of them because it makes them both jealous. Well, Matt was like "Kirsten let's go! Kirsten let's go!" But I was putting away my sodas that I had bought. Then Matt walked off somewhere -- to go to the bathroom or something; I dunno. So, I went outside with Hunter, but as soon as I was outside, Matt was there again. I started walking to his car, but I turned around just to see him saying something to Hunter. Then Hunter said something back, but I don't know what. When we got in the car I asked Matt what he had said to Hunter, but he wouldn't tell me. And we sat there for about a minute arguing about it. From where we were sitting, Hunter couldn't see us because there was a pole in the way, but we were just sitting in the parking spot so long that Hunter looked over to see what was going on. Just then, Matt started to back out. Everytime that he backs out, he puts his arm around the back of my chair so that he can turn around and look out the back. Just when Hunter looked over, he did this. I was like "Ah shit.." because last week me and Hunter had a whole big discussion about Matt...  Well, there is so much more to say, but I really have to study for retarded Chemistry. Yay! Halloween tomorrow. I need to get Jessie to go trick-or-treating with me! Too old? I am not too old to go trick-or-treating! ;)
