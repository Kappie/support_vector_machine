So I got there and we played Pretty Pretty Princess and Littlest Petshop. Then her friend Kaitlyn came over and they played for awhile until storms came and Kait went home. Since Cassie hates thunder we went downstairs and watched tv and played some more games. We also watched an hour of Barney. Joy. Then I went upstairs and made lunch...she ate so much! She nevers eats so good. She had 2 hotdogs, a bunch of corn, and a full glass of milk. I was soo proud. I think she had more than me! Then we played pollys and barbies...Around 2 or so we went to the church and colored postcards for sick people that are in the hospital. I thought it was a cute idea. Then we ran home and sat around some more and then she ended up reading me some stories. Yeah...Im wore out now...but it was fun. Shes such a cutie. Love her to death!   Oh and last night I was amused and added a bunch of stuff on here...like a hug counter...and I don't have any yet. :( Not loved. Darn LoL. Im just in a good mood.  AND...I cant wait till September! Mom and I are going to see CLAY AIKEN! :D Im soo excited! It'll be so fun! I just hope we dont have YC that weekend...But no matter what Im goin to see Clay. Yeah...its all good....today was a good day.  Tara   Current Music:  none  Current Mood:  Happy  Quote of the Day:  "Do you know how to play barbies Terri?" -Cassie
