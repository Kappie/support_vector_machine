(sorry!) we got back pretty early actually it was only midnight when we finally got home but even after the two cups of coffee i was ready for bed. i accidently slept till 12:30 which is something i never do and now feel bad about just because it feels like a giant waste of day. alex called and wondered if i wanted to go to franklin park mall but i said no... even though i should have gone... but right now i'm not feeling that good so it was probably a good idea to stay home. i'm seriously rambling now. mrs. dunn would be horrified. oh well. this is my first real update in ages.   hahahahahahaha.   sucker
