I went out to lunch at California Pizza Kitchen with Ed and his girlfriend, Dan, Erik, Dan, Steph, Jayne, Melissa, Kim, James, Emily, and I think I forgot someone, so I am sorry. We were really late when we came back, so we carried James in tied to a flag pole. That was fun and interesting and we actually received a compliment from Mr. Lesniak about it... That was even more funny and interesting. Anyways. I went home to dinner and then went back to school to register. What was sad about that is that the picture I took for my ID was probably better than all of the other pictures I've taken in high school, and this is the one that doesn't count :P. What a load of crap. Oh well. Tonight's rehearsal went pretty well; we put music to our maneuvers on the field. And we were all crazy as usual - the best part of band camp. We made some plans for tomorrow night, so we'll see how that goes. After all, it's only a half day of band camp and then two days off! Woo hoo! G'night.      Last song I listened to:   The Ascent Of Stan  by Ben Folds.   Last album I listened to:   Rockin' The Suburbs .   Last meal I ate:  A Whopper and Coke.   Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  Marching band, of course! And lunch at CPK.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  Well I'm looking for a challenging class in my schedule... :P. I'm thinking about tutoring chemistry, too.   Last person I talked to:  Melissa.   Favorite song today:   Losing Lisa  by Ben Folds.   Favorite food today:  Hawaiian pizza.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Band camp!
