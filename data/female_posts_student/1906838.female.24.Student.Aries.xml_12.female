I was disheartened .. nurse told me there really wouldnt be any way to predict what time new admissions would come in .the admission board was virtually empty .. i thought .. fine, then perhaps i'll just tag along the reg or SHO-on call and see if i could get other tasks done. ( Mind you , im only on call for Ward 40 today but then again ive already done the oncall last week.. and none of my sub-group mates even bother doing their second round of Ward 40on call .. im only here to get admissions for the GP bay..but it looks like i shouldve just stayed home and revised!) back to reg and SHO oncall.. yipeee!! wasnt i delighted when i saw who was on the ward today ... NOTT!!! my second favourite junior doctor in the world ... hahahahahha yeah right! The slutty PRHO who was part of the duo who made my life in Ward 10 (surgical) during my surgery 3 block a living nightmare ... this one was the 'milder' of the two .. the other PRHO .. god , a good example of how some jr doctors can be even more fat-headed than consultants! anyways .. the moment i spotted this slutty doctor .. who unlike the days when i was with the team in ward 10 was always clad in some 'tak cukup kain' attire .. ironically ward 10 is also the 'breast (cancer) ward' .. was today dressed like she was ready to attend some Mela or diwali function or something .. sad sad .. she doesnt have anywhere to dress like that but to the wards so the patients can drool at the sight of her..Oh btw .. she's my fellow country(wo)man .. but like that helps when u think all ur juniors who dont suck up to you are stupid and worthless??!! grrr .. im so worked up, arent i?  anyways when i saw her.. i thought .. hmmm what the heck! i dont even have to be in that ward today anyways .. so i am not bothering to hang around wasting more time waiting for some poor kid to be admitted .. i have lots of things of other important things to do. Like revising for the exams. Did quite a lot of reading yesterday .. which was interspersed with classical moments of wondering where all the bits i had revised weeks earlier had gone, and wondering why didnt i start this revision sooner ..never mind never mind. Menyesal dulu pendapatan ... menyesal kemudian tiada gunanya .. ehehekehek  Mom called to wake me up this morn at 530 am ( hahaha.. yeah thats me .. long-distant wake up calls) and told me my youngest bro Ebby had emerged champion in the dewan undangan negeri chess competition and bagged himself a huge trophy and RM200 cash. dad texted me again at about 8 am ..hahaha .. just to make sure i know about this! ;-P hehehhe.. i texted home to ask them to call me just now .. and ebby was disappointed that it was me who wanted to speak to him .. not mahathir .. d-uh .. i  know lah he cannot brag to me about the game he had played cos i havent a clue how to play chess.  Mom says the showcase at home is now full now that ebby is contributing all the trophies and what not from his chess competitions. I said to mom .. get a new showcase .. but methinks my time of contributing to our showcase of academic and extra co-curriculum achievements is slowly reaching the end. :-(  yesterday i motivated myself to study by conjuring up an image of how i would spend the first day of my holiday when i get to see golliwog again. i told him.. i just want to kick off my shoes and walk barefooted along the beach .. and indulge in the warm equatorial sun. aaahh.. thats the life innit? cant wait cant wait cant wait!!!!!!!   i told myself because i sooo want to enjoy my ten week summer break .. i dont want to worry about doing re-sits so im gonna give it all my best .. if i pass.. i will enjoy my hols to the MAX!   zak came over to the flat yesterday to borrow my psychiatric patient write up .. omigod ive been procrastinating finishing my patient writeups .. when she came i thought i better deal with my huge pile of patient notes etc .. i have such a messy pile that i couldnt find the write up so had to give her a soft copy of it. aiyer ... and i told myself at the start of the year that i will be more organized this year. hah... obviously that resolution has remained just another unachieved resolution. ....
