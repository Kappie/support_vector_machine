It started with Mel, Beth and I walking into the school without our precious blazers, and Mrs. Cranny going ballistic. I believe the last words were a threat. Brilliant. Yeh so when i walked into our locker room the 'We love the OC' vs. the 'We hate the OC' war began. We all fought for a while before slowly resigning to seperate sides of the locker room. After a while Ellen, showed up, revealing that she had watched the OC! Yay! She was soon transported to our side of the locker room. I filled Ellen in on the buffy and Angel news to ellen while she was away. I went on for a while blabbering on about James Masters on Rove, while she interrogated me 'bout what he looked like. Neway, first period finally started, which was science, i raced through my work with gemma, then rested the rest of the lesson as the rest of our dumb, slow class, finished. It is always a plus being in a dumb class. In second period, i was disappointed to find out we would not get our maths test back today. Instead, i tested my dork skills by volunteering to read my 'perfect' answers in front of the class. Ah...prissy casey. We then had recess. I was soo hungry. I gobbled up my food, still getting curious glares from my friends as to what is deppressing me. Quit it. Third period was Civics History. Joy. I started to stress as the teacher told us her new plans to be mean with homework, coz i couldnt find mine. Just as she was coming to check our homework, Morto pulled my homework out and gave it to me. "Thanks" she said. She had taken it to copy last night. I sighed with relief, knowing i allready had 3 red crosses (Ooo) and one more would result in a phone call to my parents. I dont suppose they would care. I remember in Yr 6, dad got a phone call from my teacher, saying that "Mr. Hinde, this is a serious issue, this would be the second time Casey has lit fire to the demountable!", and dad forgot to tell mum. Only joking ( i only lit fire to the school once ) but i remember my year 4 teacher calling up and telling dad that i had been the winner of this prestigious award, and that i was supposed to be at a certain place and at a certain time, wearing a certain thing, and dad forgot about the whole thing. So i had to be given the award at school. Neway, what was i talking about? Oh right! CC History. While the class read the sheets Ms. Mcbeth gave us, i (being oh so smart) started doing the questions, knowing that they would almost definately be set for homework. By the time the class finished reading, i had managed to finish the work and drift off. Excellent. I akoke suddenly as Morto gave me a painfull poke in the gut. Honestly, that girl does not know her own strength, lol. 4th period was Commerce, i just sat there playing with hannah's ruler, as Mrs. Black gave me several evil glances, each lasting for minutes. At lunch, we were all designated original spice girl names and also we played the bin game. You heard me. My idea. I took our bin over to the year 7's bin and emptied out the rubbish as the yr 7's watched in awe. Then i took it back to my group. By this time, the whole playground was watching. They must've been dam bored. N e way, i sat down, and kicked the bin as hard as i could. It landed in an angry jess's lap. She then kicked it back, i kicked it sideways, landing on gem, gem chucked it on the ground screaming, then we all did one big kick at the same time, so the bin flew up in the air, andlanded back on the fuming Jess. "I'm sorry" i said in mockery. Because of the hight the bin had reached, it had captured the attention of CB, as he strutted over in his stomach high pants and evil glare. At that, Lauren had straightened up pretendng to be mature for lover boy. He told us to stop playing with the bin. By that time i had crept off towards the locker room so my friends would have the invisable Casey to blame. All part of my devious plan...5th period was Art. It was prac. thankfully. I finished off my art work, which was a tree sculpture bcoz they wanted us to say sorry to the trees (lol!?) and made a cast for my finger. I went to the other art room where i stood alone, drying my cast under the hand dryer. It wasn't long until i heard the pounds on the window from the year seven's who were trying to come in. I laughed at them. I stayed there a bit longer drying the cast, then deliberately walked up to the door, pretended to fiddle with the lock, then stood back a foot, and watch them all dive to the door trying to open it. When they finally realised i hdnt unlocked it, they looked up to see me laughing maliciously and walking away. How i do like to taunt the wee young ones. They deserve it. Most of them think they are god's ONLY gift to the world. Last period was english. I don't remember what happened coz i fell asleep within 2 minutes of the lesson. Alison Doube screamed out "Casey!" at the top of her lungs as everyone else put their chairs on the desk. With a jerk, i suddnely shot up, hitting my head on her chair. That was my day, then i went home. lol. I suppose in hindsight, that wasn't a good day, but that is about as good as my days get unfortunately. Luv cm
