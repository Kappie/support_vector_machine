Why the fuck was there current? Why did he have to die?! What would it be like to see him? To say i love you dad. What would my life be like? would he love me? I just don't know. I want to see him. thats just not possible. But you know my step-dad is my dad. he has been here in my life for as long as i can remember. There may be downsides with my step-dad, and trust me there were. but hes my dad. Why kind life be simple? Why do people have to go through such pain. I just dont understand.  Hannah
