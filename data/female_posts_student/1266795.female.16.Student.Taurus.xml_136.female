She deserves the position more than any of the other incredibly unqualified candidates.  If you want to know more, ask me. (I have some wonderfully strange stories, like almost being virtually raped on the dance floor. It's much funnier in person, believe me.)  Time for a new end quote! This one was thought up by Ash and me while watching pieces of "Les Mis."   She said that she liked the name Jean Valjean. I said that if she liked it so much that she      should name one of her kids after him.   I reminded her that       my kids are going to be adopted from various Asian countries. She told me, "SO? Name one of the boys Jean Valjean and send him to France." I replied, "Oh, yeah. I can see it now: The kid will be telling people - "Oh, I'm Chinese/Korean/Japanese/etc., but I have a French name and an American mommy. She sent me on a cruise in the Atlantic and left me here. I've been rejected... twice!"  "I've been rejected...twice!"
