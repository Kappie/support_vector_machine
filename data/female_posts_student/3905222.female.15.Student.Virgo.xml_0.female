What brighten up the day is the thinking of visiting the band, clarinet and my juniors after school. Today got geography lesson and we are suppose to hand in an assignment. Last night i spend about one hour doing the assignment haiZ... but when i go school after i lend my work to a friend i cannot find it back. but i guess it should be with my friend but she never notice she took it. I never blame her but i wish she return it to me tomorrow so i can hand it up. HaiZ... but whenever i think of band it will brighten me up. Today Mr Lim was to pass the CDs from Mr Chong to me. Mr Chong help me to burn all the pictures he taken in our school band and also give me the music exchange VCD.. wah so happy ya know.. now i can enjoy looking at those pictures and listen to our band play the songs... haha those pictures are so funny leh.. he also give me some of the pictures of himself haha... ^-^
