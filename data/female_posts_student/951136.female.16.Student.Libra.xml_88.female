GET ME OUT!!! this is sickening...i need to wake up. literally, this has to be some kind of whicked dream. falling deeper and deepper into someplace dark where i dont want anyone else inside. i snapped at my only two friends today. sorry, i'm just ..... -exactly- blank, cant you tell? All day long i think of all these things. And want to say something about it, or talk about it w. someone. but when i finally do get to someone who would talk about it or has an opinion on it, it never comes up, or i forget. or am just plain not in the mood anymore. this is bad. i hate this place, the state of mind i'm in. I know what everyone is going to say before i even say it. so i dont want to say it. Even ppl who aren't usually predictable.  its just, my life is old. i feel like i've already lived it. i know what my parents will say, so know what topics will succumb to comments like "you're not over him are you?" so i never even can talk about drumming... i know what isnt good enough so i dont show it to anyone. i know what i have to do, so i dont want to hear it. i know what is going on, so i dont need to ask. its all old. there is nothing new. the situation never changes. the ppl may be different. but i've seen it already. i dont want to stand around and obsess about something. i'm through. it was bad enough last year, and the beginning of this year. and look where it got us. for me- it just clouded over life, and the important things that were going on. So when it was over, i woke up in the trash of everything i'd left to waste away. and i'm still cleaning up myself. i dont regret it, b.c. it was fun, worth while, but i'm not letting myself go back there. I'm not trying to be a party-pooper, and i dont mean i dont want to hear about it, i do! just, im not letting myself be pulled in  to anyone like i was.  likewise..i dont feel like talking much lately. i dont really need anyone's opinion. tho i like hearing it. thats me-  some ppl say i'm quite. others say i'm really not. but, i guess i am. i like listening. i rather hear what other ppls opinions are. thats who i am. i sat in that back seat and i listen to two guys talk. thats my way of seeing what someone is all about. how they talk to someone at ease. i know them that way. ya, i talk and after a while, join in. but i like listening to ppl talk around me when it's worth while things. i learn more. some ppl would call it not having a mind of your own. whatever. sitting there, listening to ppl talk comfortably about stuff, i'm not being ignored, but i'm just not really involved in that conversation. ugh. whatever. point is. there is no point. im just explaining. since i feel like i have to. and i know its useless to try.
