On October 12, 1978, in room 100 of New York's Chelsea Hotel, Sid Vicious allegedly murdered his girlfriend of 21-months.  It is reported that Nancy Sprugen, a Sex Pistols groupie and bed mate of Sid, was stabbed to death by Sid with a hunting knife.  4-months later, torchured by the agony of living without his true love, Sid Vicious ended his life at the age of 21.  John Simon Ritchie (or Sly as he was called before) was only 19 when the Sex Pistols reached number one on the UK charts with 'God Save the Queen'.  No one could imagine that he would only live another 2 years in the spotlight.  Click here to read a great  urlLink BIO  on Sid.                                                         R.I.P.
