It makes me want to hum off-key and dance with arms up in the air even with all the messy screw ups. And I got it back just in a day, despite four months of not playing it (four months?).   THAT VONS TURKEY BACON GUACAMOLE SANDWICH. Oh man, J, that was good while we had it. And remember the picketers who told us we could get extra meat at Ralphs? Compared to Quizno's today, that one was perfect. I believe it's time to go on another pilgrimage for that holy sandwich.  PAJAMA PANTS. need I say more?  FRIED RICE, straight from LA. Pineapple in it too. And Hong Kong-style noodles  GOOD TV. Speaking of which...
