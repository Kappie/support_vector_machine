I went to see Harry Potter 3 for the fourth time by myself yesterday (no, I do not have a life, but thanks for asking) and when I was in line to get the ticket, there was this lady in front of me with her three kids and her mother who was like 60. I didn't really notice her, though, until I was in line to get food. She was in front of me in line, with her kids zipping around everywhere, and she wasn't doing anything to calm them or keep them from annoying everyone else. Then when she was done paying, she turned around and practically bowled me over because apparently I was in her Majesty's way and it would be an injustice to the world to move out of the way herself.   When I was walking down the hall towards the theater, the Queen was screeching at this other lady who was there with her kids. Here is how the conversation went:  The Queen: Excuse me. I REALLY didn't appreciate how you just STEPPED IN FRONT OF ME in line when I was standing there talking to my mother! Innocent Victim: I didn't think I did anything like that. The Queen: Well, YOU DID! Innocent Victim: Well I'm sorry you feel that way... The Queen: I just thought it was a HORRIBLE thing to do in front of your children, you're setting an awful example.  I wanted to turn around and say "right, and YOUR kids aren't going to be scarred for life because their mother overreacts to things that aren't even worth getting pissed about because HOLY CRAP, a person steps in front of you in line, YOU CAN'T WAIT ANOTHER TWO MINUTES TO GET  YOUR  FOOD? WHAT A GREAT EXAMPLE YOU ARE SETTING FOR YOUR OWN KIDS. YOU'RE RAISING THE NEXT GENERATION OF PEOPLE THAT EVERYONE HATES TO BE AROUND BECAUSE THEY ACT LIKE THEY ARE THE CENTER OF THE FREAKING UNIVERSE." People like that are just SO retarded. "Well I am going to inconvenience everyone in the world for the sake of my own happiness. But I'm going to complain if someone DARES do something that annoys me in the slightest." LADY! SELFISH PEOPLE DIE ALONE!!!!!!!!! REMEMBER THAT!!!!!  I was really really hoping that I would never have to see this lady again, but no. When I got into the theater and had sat down, GUESS WHO COMES IN AND SITS DOWN... RIGHT BEHIND ME. Yes. The Queen and her kids. And the Queen's mother was there too. Through the whole movie, someone was kicking my seat. Apparently, Queen, Sr. does not know how to watch a movie without being ANNOYING. It wasn't just the tapping kind of kicking either. It was the "I'm going to lodge my foot on the side and bounce around because I have a lot of energy" kind of kicking. It was the most horrible thing in the world. I was like okay, sorry if you haven't been to a movie in twenty years, but people STILL don't like having their seat kicked. What is wrong with people that NO ONE is considerate of anyone but themselves anymore? I don't understand this.  But the worst part wasn't the mom kicking my seat, or seeing the Queen screeching at another lady in the hall, or almost being trampled in the concession line. No, it was the little girl. The Princess sat through the entire movie, TALKING. She was actually pretty smart for a five year old or whatever she was, and she was adorable. But please. If you HAVE little kids who are going to talk through a movie like that, THEY ARE NOT OLD ENOUGH TO GO TO THE MOVIES. I swear, when I have kids they are not going to the theater until they know that TALKING IS NOT ALLOWED BECAUSE IT PISSES PEOPLE OFF. the girl was like "what's wrong with Harry? Is he sad? Is that his parents? Where is Harry going? Why is it dark? What is that dog doing? Why is that bus purple?" and on and on and on and ON... "does Harry really like that man? I thought he was bad. What's happening to them? Are they going to die? AWOOO! AWOOOO! AWOOO!" (continues AWOOOing for the rest of the movie)  So I guess what I want to say is, I am never going to the movies ever again unless someone else is paying for my ticket and there are NO kids in the entire theater.
