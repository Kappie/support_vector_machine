AHHH haha ! i think it's time for me to go to bed.. i'm so delirious.  it's kind of depressing thinking about how many much of my summer assignments i have left and i really don't want to do it.. there's this little demon that's always laughing at me though saying i'm going to get a zero. normally it's a positive person pushing me to do things.. but this is a bad voice. jill knows what i'm talking about... me and jill have positive voices in our head that talk us through tests. hahaha! but i think this is my procrastination demon. that son of a bitch needs to go away or i will never finish my stuff.  i can't wait to go to houston this weekend though. i miss my laura and i need to finish up my school shopping. :o)  that's all for now. later.
