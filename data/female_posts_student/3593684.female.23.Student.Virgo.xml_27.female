Mulling over the stupid things we said or did, analyzing why relationships went sour and what we could have done differently.  Or we waste time daydreaming about the better times to come.  The plans we have for the weekend or the new year or our retirement.  But rarely do we appreciate the moment.  Well I'm gonna try and do little mother fucking appreciation right now, but let me tell you, it's not as easy as it looks.   Right now, one of the only two dryers in my aparment complex is broken and I have 11 loads of laundry to do.  Wet clothing is hanging up all over my room and the fan is only full blast.  It's four-thirty, but at least it's saturday afternoon.  How's that for appreciation: at least it's not a god damn sunday.  okay, now that I got that whole living in the moment thing over with I will go back to my living in the past routine, two nights past to be specific.  Mr. Saturday night took me out on thursday.  It was my first one-night stand.  Technically I guess it wasn't a one-night stand, because I had actually met him thursday and he did indeed call me on friday.  But still, it was the first time I ever fucked somebody on the first date.  Honestly, i am usually shy about that sort of stuff, at least initially.    But... I am feeling awfully nihilistic lately.  So mr. s and I were at a bar, shooting pool drinking Jack and Coke and I was feeling antsy and contentious and I had to get out of the place (which was packed full of tools).  So we ended up back at my place and we started making out and I was drunk, but not so drunk I didn't know what I was doing.    It was the weirdest sex I have ever had.  I swore at him and he called me a fucking whore.  I told him to do whatever he wanted, he said he wanted to tear me apart.  I can't tell if I was playing his game or if he was playing mine, or if we were both just using each other.  Honestly, the sex was only mediocre.  He is not very well endowed.  I guess that sounds shallow and unfair. Maybe it is a little unfair.  to be truthful he is probably about average but... Well, I guess the real problem is that the sex was so fucking good with david that everything sort of sucks in comparison.  Anyway.  The weird thing is that I expected to feel really guilty about the whole situation, but I don't at all.  I don't really feel anything.  I'll probably see him again, if we ever connect that is.  We've been playing phone tag the last two days.    okay.  I have to go live in the moment again and finish up my fucking laundry.
