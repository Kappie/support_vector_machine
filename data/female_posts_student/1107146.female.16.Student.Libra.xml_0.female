She's ruining one of my bestfriend's life and you expect me to stand here and do nothing?!' Yea, who ever said this, Yea, YOU said this, and Yea, *I* nor Leigh-Anne made it up. Yea, I'm the other girl on the phone, I'm sorry, but are we a level to be stooped upon just because of our age and grade level? That's pretty shallow. Leigh Anne's not mad at Rosie, nor at anyone, but i'm angry because of this, I did NOTHING. I was protecting my friend. I have dislike for you already Lindsey, but im not about to go off being a bitch about it all because I can't do that in here. Anywho I'm out of here.  Lily The Psycho Powered Goddess
