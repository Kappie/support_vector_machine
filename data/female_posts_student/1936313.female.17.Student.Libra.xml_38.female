Andrew has been found.. so boo or hooray or whatever it should be, he woke up late and was therefore late for his exam... by a half an hour.. he's lucky they let him in to write it...  It's been super hot today and I got less then 3 hours of sleep last night and I doubt I'll get much better tonight even without nightmares it's still so hot.  I want to go for a walk... Mom and I used to go out late for walks around the neighborhood when it was hot out and we couldn't sleep... and after that Michael used to find some way to drag me out.  Those were the days..... when you wouldn't get shot for coming out of your own yard.  I'm glad we moved neighborhoods.. even if I miss the old house and the memories it held..... back then all I wanted to do was get away from what I had thought were ghosts... Thats what you get for being a stupid kid..  Michaels sister called today and we had a loooong talk... like entirely through err.. well some sort of Mandy Moore movie.. I wasn't really paying attention... I never realized how little I knew about her.. heh.. back then everything was about Michael and Me.. or Me and Michael...  Annyways... we shuffled our way through a lot of memories, both good and bad, heh half of them absolutely insane because thats how Michael was... and yea even though it put me down, waayy down in the darkest parts of my mind again, it was good.. I'm glad she called, it let me center myself again around my thoughts... I think...  It wouldn't have happened if it wasn't meant to. He was too good a guy to not have something better planned for him... and someday.. he'd damned well better find his way back to me... he promised.  The longer I think about it.. the more undecided I am over whether or not it was for the best. It tore me to pieces watching Mom go in and out, good day.. bad day... completely backwards day... It broke my heart. Michael knew that.. its why he didn't tell me at first when he became sick... I don't know if I could have stood there and watch it all unfold all over again... that was always what i said my biggest fear was.. having to watch it happen all over again...  That doesn't mean I wanted that phone call.. that I wanted him gone in a flash... Like a bullet striking me down before I even saw the gun. Which is why I can't decide whether or not it was for the best. That last christmas it was obvious Mom wasn't going to recover.. even if we refused to acknowledge it.. we all knew... She knew.  I didn't get to be there for her... but she wouldn't have wanted that anyways.. I didn't get to be there for him though.... and i'm left wondering if he would have survived the night if I was...  Bleh...  I don't want to go to sleep again.
