They all seem so mature for just being 4 and 5 years old. Well, I probably didn't help as much as I was supposed to, mostly because I was too involved with playing dress up with the girls and building gigantic wooden block zombie trap mansions with the boys. I wanted to help them color their baby dinosaurs too, but I knew where the line was.  In other news, there's no other news. It is such a pretty day outside, I jogged around the track after school. I'm going to go to the gym in a little while. I had a good low-carb eating day. For breakfast, I had yogurt and soymilk again, and then for lunch I had a soyburger with cheese, tomatoes, and pickles (without bread, of course). Mum is cooking salmon tonight with a salad, so that should be safe. I'm trying to go two weeks without eating bread or pasta or desserts or soft drinks of any kind (starting today). We'll see how far I get.   I'm still reading Woman: An Intimate Georgraphy. It's a long book. The current chapter is entitled "Wolf Wistles and Hyena Smiles:Testosterone and Women." That's right, if you didn't know already, women have testosterone and men have estrogens (which in fact masculinize the fetal brain). I knew that from psych classes already, but it's nice to be reminded.     Does peanut butter have carbs?  I might go to Barnes and Noble after dinner and after my gym class if it isn't too late.
