Other than that it was cool. I wore my 'hoochie suit' and now half my butt is red and the other half is white... fun fun. Anyway, it was a good time... me and Eric attacked the waves head on (sometimes butt-first to protect my eyes) and then me and my mom sat in the sand and let the waves come to us while we searched for sea shells. (while getting a decent amount of sand up my butt i might add). Then on the way home, me and my bro (Sorry Emma... my bro and  I ) bugged my parents (and each other) for the 2 hours back to Raleigh. (ex: 1 fat hen and a couple a ducks, I slit a sheet, and we even got to the penguins in a bathtub joke (which my parents are still trying to figure out... lol) I got back fine, but today I'm totally burned pretty much everywhere except where my bathing suit was (which isn't a lot of coverage area... :) so I'm in pain. Go figure. We looked at another church today and I liked it a lot better. I'm still on the hot southern guy alert and I still can't wait till school starts... Today I painfully took my shower, we headed out for church, and then we ate at Cafe Carolina and Bakery. It was yummy, kind of like Panara. Then we went shopping and my dad told Eric and I that we were responsible for making lunch and dinner Mon-Fri including shopping. So we bought a crapload of raman noodles and... just kidding. But that kinda sucks. I don't claim to be an expert chef and let me tell you my brother isn't either. It's going to be an interesting experience. Dan is still in Charleston visiting his friend Alex and he'll be back tonight. (They were celebrating cause the Cubs got Nomar!!! woo hoo!) And my birthday is soon (Aug. 14th) so I'm awaiting that, although yall know the dillema about the lisence thingy. Hopefully I'll get a puppy (what I really really want) or a new bed (that my room can finally fit!) So life is better, but I still miss you guys and I just love getting mail from you all the time. Hugs and kisses to yall...*
