Did you know being on a computer burns calories? i think thats cool. Anyways, well today i figured out just how fast my dads computer is!! i can download a whole cd and burn me a copy in less than 10mins!! so i went to town, getting on www.amazon.com to find cool cds and get the order of the songs, then looked them all up on LimeWire and burned me some cds! i didnt do all the cds i wanted today, because i have to have something to do tomorrow. I burned Avril Lavigne, Jessica Simpson, The O.C. soundtrack, Blink-182, and Yellow Card oh and can't forget Rooney!! 6 cds today...wow....and sometimes if they are short cds i can get 2 on one disk, that saves me some cds! haha Anyways, i have a whole list for tomorrow. :D can't wait. I love music. haha im really bored...thats all...haha.   I called kaela today! i was so excited to call her! haha  I had a bad dream last night, it even made me wake up at 9:30am!! thats too early!! and i woke up crying. I dreamed kaela died. And all i did in my dream was cry and hope she was playing a joke and would come back to me. I know i just missed her, thats why i dreamed it. I told her all about it over the phone and on an email.   *much love*
