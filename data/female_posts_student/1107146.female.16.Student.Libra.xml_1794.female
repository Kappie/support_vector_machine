While you all sit back and enjoy a drink compliments of the Ringside, I'll be killing Deech with projectile weapons and other such nuances of much-deserved abuse. And of course, I'll hold him down and let you all have turns with him for being a stupid ass, with a weapon of your choice, and suits to prevent his befilthed blood from spoiling your clothing.   Good job Deech, you really screwed with the wrong group.  Abby, don't forget culinarily-endowed, Spinning Song-etiquetted, and brilliant. The rest is also absolutely correct.
