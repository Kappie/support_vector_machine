Keeps rubbin in my face that he'll be 21 August 30 though and so I'd like to punch him in the face for that! lmao! but nahh really. he's cool...I think Dylan messed around with him a LITTLE too much...but Dylan's like that. Pretty annoying most of the time. I had fun while we were out...didn't get to go out much though b/c dad works from like 6:30 in the morning til from 4-8 every nite. But he does have Sunday's off! So...Sunday...we all loaded up and went to the beach...was lots of fun. Got a little burnt...but that's what happens when you stay in the house all the time..never get outside..then all of a sudden head to the beach in a bikini and stay there for hours. But it's ok. As long as I get a tad bit darker from it, it's worth it.  Oh   Oh ...mad is what I am   right   now. Far beyond MAD...let me tell you why. My dog, Furball..yeah..the people that were lettin us keep him...came and got him AND his dad, Choco, while we were gone on our little vaycay. I will get him back, if I have to get a job and pay her for the thing, I'll do it. I love him so much...I walked in the house today and I'm so used to him runnin up to me and waggin his little tail and try to jump up on me...he's so cute...and he sleeps with me and follows me around everywhere...but not anymore...and it makes me really sad...I just cried about it.  Anyways. Brad took Laura Page to H'ville this week while I was gone. It upset me when he first told me but whatever...I mean we AREN'T anything at all. There is no "us". I can't get mad over stuff like that...can I? I shouldn't. Considering some things that I won't mention. So all I have to say to that is....Whatever. *he* wants to see me...what am I going to do? See him probably.  I talked to Brett a lot while I was down in Pensacola..he's the only one that cared enuf to call and check on me! lol! We talked for like 4 hours one night...long time huh?  Anywho, I'm off to bed...pretty tired...ridin' in a car then van from Pensacola to Scottsboro with 3 kids is...horrible.
