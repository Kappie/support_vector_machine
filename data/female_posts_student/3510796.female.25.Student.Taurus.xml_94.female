At the last second on a question about playwrights, I changed my answer from Edward Albee to Eugene O'Neill, and lost 2,000 points because of it. You do the math. Still ranked #20 across the whole network though, so I reckon I didn't do all that bad. I'd just like to beat my prof - and I might have beaten him, too, if his friend next to him wasn't feeding him answers to all the sports questions.      After that, it was out to the pub with the gang from work for the usual Thursday night thing. Liana's 21st birthday was that night, so of course it was a special occasion. Poor little Liana, you'd think that after two years at Eastern, she'd have built up some hardcore tolerance - but we had her all giggly and slap-happy in 45 minutes. You're swimming with the big fish now, sunshine.       We closed down the place, and Nick told us that he was watching his sister's condo while she was on vacation, and we were all invited to stop by. So I headed over, along with Suzzy and Katrina. The complex is situated below street level, so that leading from the street down to the parking lot, there's a steep hill, about 20 feet high with a 45 degree slope. The three of us were waiting outside in the lot (because Nick had left his sister's keys at home... dumbass,) when Katrina sprung up and climbed the hill. She gets to the top, yells "Hey guys!" and promptly falls over and rolls all the way down. We run over to her, she pops up and goes "Wow! That was the most violent thing ever!" And so of course we all decide to climb up to the top, beers in hand while we wait for Nick. A few minutes later, Katrina stands up and decides to walk down the hill. Now as you might guess, she was pretty damn tipsy, so I stand up and hold her hand just to steady her Raise your hand if you see where this one is going. She lets go of my hand, and promptly goes for another roll down the hill. I follow her down, walking at first, picking up speed a little as I near the bottom, and as I get close to her, I find a nice wet patch of grass. BOOM. Right down on my tailbone. Fun stuff. Nick finally showed up, and we spent the night drinking, talking about whatever, sitting out on the balcony, and trying to allsleep in the same bed (what an ill-conceived idea that was.) We finally cashed out at around 7 in the morning.      Before we went to sleep, Suzzy, having sobered up a good deal, had me come out with her on the balcony while she lit up a cigarette. We sat down and talked, and she told me some stuff about the way she feels toward me that was absolutely incredible. She's an absolutely amazing friend, one whom I'm very lucky to have. Between Wednesday and Thursday, I had two of my friends tell me things that, dare I say, gave me feelings of confidence and self-esteem. It's just so good to know that there are people who like me, and love me, just because of who I am. It also makes me wonder if I really want to move out of state when the whole scenario is said and done - I don't know that I want to leave people like these.       Friday       AnotherFriday nightof "musical" entertainment in the cafe. Last week, we had a band called Seven Day Run, who were downright professional. I mean, they actually sounded really good, and that's not something I'm used to from the acts in the cafe. Their sound had a little bit of DMB and Sister Hazel mixed into it, it seemed, and it worked really well. Of course, for every yin, there must be a yang, and man, did we ever get yanged last night. Two hippie chicks with a dulcimer and a banjo. If I didn't know better, I would have thought they were shooting a sequel to "A Mighty Wind," because they were so bad, it was downright comical. Some people in the crowd actuallly seemed to be enjoying themselves, and I felt like shouting at them "No! Don't clap! You're only encouraging them!" One of the managers, Matthew, gives me a call and says, "I know you're suffering over there right now, so I thought I might cheer you up with some readings from the Garfield Joke Book..." He's a sick bastard, I tell ya. And then it happened: in the middle of a song, one of the ladies starting wailing away... on the kazoo. You could see every single employee in the store turn their heads toward the cafe, with an expression that simply said, "What the fuck?!?" A couple of people at the info deskturned their eyes to me for my reaction. I simply held up a sign, written in red marker, that read "HELP ME." Britt came by when I got a line (how that kazoodidn't drive every last customer out of the store, I'll never know,) and she asked me, "So, how about that kazoo, huh?" and I was like "Oh, it was great and all, but you know what I could really use right now?" "What?" "I need more cowbell." Britt almost fell over laughing. I realize that won't make any sense to you unless you've seen Saturday Night Live's "Best of Will Ferrell" collection, which is why you need to go rent it or buy it right now. You'll be all about the cowbell, too. At least tips were good last night. Some customers would drop in money, look over at the band, and offer me their sympathies. Hey, whatever pays the bills.
