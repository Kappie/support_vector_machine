This year's Reading lineup includes Morrissey, 50 Cent, and The White Stripes.   I don't work for 7-11, but my parents did own a franchise for many years, so please excuse my 7-11 enthusiasm. Go 7-11! I remember an old giveaway in the early 80's where I won about 50 t-shirts with pictures of slurpees on them. Back then, the slurpee cups just had a tab at the bottom where you got your game card. For this round, you'll need to punch in the number from your slurpee cup at the  urlLink headache inducingly noisy Slurpee site . But you can avoid the Flash madness a little by skippping to the mercifully "music"-less   urlLink contest site . I'm going to be singing the "slurp slurp" ditty all day.   The Pepsi contest was sort of fun, especially after MacMerc discovered how to  urlLink be a winner every time . If I discover any such thing for Slurpee, I won't hold out, I promise. Oh, one more Slurpee tip from an expert: the new Diet Pepsi slurpee is very tasty for anyone avoiding carbs (not me). However, considering this is a Coca-Cola thing, you'll probably have to gulp some sugar until the promotion is over.
