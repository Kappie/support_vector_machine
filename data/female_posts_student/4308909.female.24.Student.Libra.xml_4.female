Its simplicity gets its point across and seems to have a similar metaphor as something I read on their "about us" page. It goes:   "The work of The Oâ€™Neill focuses on the script as it begins its journey to the stage. The actors work with minimal props and no sets or costumes, holding scripts in their hands, revealing for the first time the magic of a new play or musical, puppetry piece or cabaret act."   I think based on this metaphor the website could do more with this idea. Playing up the values that is most important can enhance its image and yet still be a professional looking website.     I also think the navigation on the subpages is better than on the index page. Also while the differing alignments aren't that pleasing to the eye they made great use of the images. The images are so great and add a great dimension to the site. It's more human and interactive that way because you can connect with the people performing in the pictures. I also like the artistic circles in the background that remain constant. However, the actual content on the page is so close that it feels cluttered. Perhaps it could use more "white space" in places. And lastly, I think the white boxes that they put text on seems too out of place. Maybe they could use a lighter gradient of the background color on the page to help the box blend in instead of standing out too much. I do however think that further analysis of the site could be very useful recommendations to the O'Neill Theater because they have a very good basic concept going that can be improved upon with not too much redesign in my opinion.
