I mean I had reasons why Ifelt that way butthey were all just so...out there. And now I have terrible cramps. But another reason I hope it is  that , so I can eat junk food again! Yeah, I'm on a diet. I can only eat junk food on holidays and when I have my period. And I'm sure as hell craving from Double Fudge Brownie ice cream... Ahh, it's good tobe a woman sometimes... LoL! Just felt like sharing!
