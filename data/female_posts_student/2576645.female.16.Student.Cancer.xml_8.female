While I was watching Buffy today from 4 oclock to 6 oclock (uummm..ya...thats how lame I am...you didn't know that already?), I suddenly realized I absolutely LOVE Spike. In case you don't know, Spike is a very hot, (but unfortunately) very vampire-ish character on the show, with an adorable english accent. And, as most will know, I go crazy when I hear a hot guy speak with a british accent. The wierd thing is I usually do not like 'bad boys' but Spike is the exception.   I do believe I will be watching a lot more episodes since my revelation. Buffy is a very good show....lets call it 'educational'. I have learned many lessons since I tuned it. Such as: 1. Always carry a 'shape pointy stick' with you when walking deserted grave yards at night. 2. Your principal is actually a giant evil snake. 3. Everygirl has a soft spot for hot, english, bleach blonde bad boys. 4. It is very tough to be 'The Key'...or its sister. 5. The government might be making robots disquised as 'slayer' boyfriend material.    And finally: Highschool is a porthole to hell.
