Joy!) And the prize was tic-tacks! And I can't really be bothered! Sorry, but some times being hyper happy is too much effort! Damn I hate that. Ahh, but real big question: Does it take more energy to be happy or sad? It takes quite a lot to mope because you've got to concentrate on being miseable! Fun! Yeah yeah I'm going with my stupid ramblings! Oh and WOW Tag-Board! USE IT! Ehe... did I say that out load again? Damn! Here Laura Laura, come and trample the nice people. (don't ask)
