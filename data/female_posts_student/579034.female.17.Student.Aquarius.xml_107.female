Math, we just learned how to like figure out these things called Varience, Frequency, and Standard Deviation on our calculators, took a test in Spanish, Chem was Chem. Got my test back - 72 - shoot me in the face please. Mr. Thompson really didn't teach today, then came Art which is always fun cause Mrs. Volpe is AWESOME. Then, Mrs. Galligano was absent so English was a breeze cause Mr. Clark was our sub. Then lunch which is always an adventure, then History. Nothing too special. The one thing I love about Mondays is everyones always talkin about the drama that went down over the weekend.  AND!!!! DEBRA HAS A BOYFRIEND, DEBRA HAS A BOYFRIEND!!!! you go girl ::snap snap snap:: Guys I'm going to be 17 in 2 days. How sick is that? I think it's pretty sick. 3 days till Mickey. x0x
