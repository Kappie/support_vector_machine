But, right now, I'm excited about THIS summer, which is FOUR WEEKS AWAY. Holy moly. My first summer having my license! Concerts, camping, summer camp, Wild Waves, hot days at the park, Bumbershoot, barbeques, lunch in Pike Place, tubing at Caitlin's, AAAH i can't even stand it I'm so anxious for it all to start!!!  Oo Ryan got 3rd at the art competition and is going to Texas for Nationals, so cool! Cept for the Texas part. Cause Texas is far away, and it's full of hicks. But that's okay, we'll forgive them. Today was the recital, wasn't as bad as I thought. This day went by really really slow. Well, it's Sunday. They always go by slow. Ew school tomorrow. I'm gonna blow it up. Someday.
