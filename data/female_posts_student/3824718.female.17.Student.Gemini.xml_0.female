Monday i did ok which was rather shocking cuz myshoulderdidn't hurt. Tuesday i did really well and wednesday i sucked. He wanted to see my drop alot and it just wasn't workin out. So yeah. And then today my shoulder was killing me so i sucked even worse. Anyways this morning the doctor dude called mom and told her that its seperated and he wants to do surgery after the season. The deal is he said it takes 6 to 8 months to healcompletely and i only have 4 after highschool ball before for the maverics start up agian. and theres no way i can even go for months with out pitching cuz i'll be screwed. Anyways my dads taking me down to arizona to visit the campus next week and im stoked. I've wanted to play for the wildcats for like..ever. lol.        Jesse just went back to doing the same things he did before. Pete came over and gave me like the worst most romantic moment of my life. So i'm spending the week at Harlies apartment ~>all by myself :^)        Anyways someone tells jesse that they saw pete's car and that me and him were there alone. not even anything about he was naked lol. And jesse calls me on my cellphone while im in the middle of watching sex and the city so of course i was a little pissed. And he is all chewing me out for having pete there and being "bitchy" about him finding out. And im all flustered cuz i'm missin my damn show for this so im just like look jess i'll call you back later and being the asshole he is he is like "holy jesus he's still there isn't he?" so i just hung up and left the phone off the hook. damn. So i called him at nine and told him what went down and how i "upset" i was that he thought i could do anything to him. (like him thinking i cheated on him would be any big shocker.) So i told him i couldn't take it anymore and broke up with him. And thats where we are now. bye :^)    P.S. Katie Ebbins is coming how from UCLA this weekend so im gunna get to see my favorite 19 yr old in the whole world ( including my sisters lol) LOVE YOU HAYLIE! LOVE YOU HARLIE! heh :^)
