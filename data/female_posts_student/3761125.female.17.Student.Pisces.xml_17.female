I had completely forgotten that they do that sometimes when you hand in a resume so I'm slightly flustered all of a sudden but I'm keeping my cool.  He asks when I'm available.  Easy stuff.  Full-time until September and after that part-time.  Great.  One down.  Next question... "what kind of music do you like?" Fuck!  Seriously.  I could list of 1092127893 bands that I love, and I could go into great detail as to why I love each and every one of them.  But do I say that?  No.  It's awkward and it really doesn't help me that this guy is fucking gorgeous.  So I'm stumbling over words.  Great.  But I do say my favorite band is Radiohead.  Thank god I remember Radiohead.  He asks me, "Old Radiohead or new Radiohead?" And so I tell him I like everything after their first album.  He asks me why not the first one?  And if he asked me NOW, I would have said because it was their first attempt at recording an album, they didn't know what they were doing, and it really shows in the album.  Did I say that though?  NO.  You know what I said?  "Because it's... crap, really." He laughed and said something along the lines of "Yeah, I agree, *nods* good."  Eh... maybe he'll like that I have a sense of humor?  I failed to mention Pink Floyd, Led Zep, Secret machines, how I love the indie rock scene in NYC.  UGH.  Well, they'll keep my resume on file for 6 months.  I really hope I get it.  Who knows?    On the plus side, I bought bright green Converse sneakers today.  One more to add to my... soon-to-be collection.  I now have two pairs.  They're fucking brilliant, those shoes.  I feel good today... food-wise.  I just feel really confident about myself.  I like how I look.  Things are okay.  I just have bad days every so often, still.  I really think I'll be okay though.  How much of a genius is Will Ferrell?  Seriously.  I love that guy.  God DOES exist and his real name is WILL FERRELL.  He goes by God because it just sounds so powerful.  "God" is Will Ferrell's stage name.
