And if it is, well, we all know that sometimes I am mean too, neither of these things I can really help.  And that is in all seriousness.  Get it, like not sarcastic.  Oh wow *dorkness appears*.    I'm off to Maine in the morning.  Lots of work to do when we get up there, but it'll be nice to see the condo for the first time.  See y'all Friday or bright and early Saturday at Yahoo.  Joy.
