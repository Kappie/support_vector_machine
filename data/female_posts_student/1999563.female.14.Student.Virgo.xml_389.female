Its going to have a nice wood bench surrounded by large shading plants where I can sit in the summer time and read or write. its going to have wonderful smelling flowers and fresh herbs. The best thing of all, i'm going to make it all by myself!  I began the work on my garden earlier today. I dug up the area of my garden.  When I was busy digging my dad pulled up, home from my grandparents. When he saw that I was busy destroying our pricless lawn he got SO mad! He was like "What are you doing?!?!?!?!" So I told him about my garden and how mom said I should dig there. We was like "I don't want this mess to be the first thing people see when they drive up!!" He was mad.  But my garden will be beautiful I will show him! Mwa haha.
