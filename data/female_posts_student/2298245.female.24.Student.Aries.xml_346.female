He compares this performance to his earlier no-hitter back in 1990:   "That was far from perfect," he recalled. "I was a very young pitcher who didn't have any idea where the ball was going. I was far from being a polished pitcher. Fourteen years later, I've come a long way as far as knowing what I want to do."   It sounds very exciting.  I only wish I had seen it instead of just reading about it.
