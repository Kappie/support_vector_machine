I went and saw Saved! with Veronica it was hilarious. It managed to make fun of only the right wing freak Christians and not the normalish ones. Very good. Veronica is coming over around one and we're going to Jane's house to go swimming.   My computer is in sad, sad shape. I could almost cry. The caseing around the LCD screen is broken so the screen is wobbling around, held together with various wires, packaging tape, and propped on a pillow.   I did NOT beat Dark Cloud 2. But I can live with it. I went to the last boss and fought an endless number little bosses without being able to save then died against the BOSS. I was not going through that hell again.   I did laundry. I have no job. Went to a party on friday but I left early. I only knew one person there. Apparently right after I left someone came out. I think gay beams follow me...
