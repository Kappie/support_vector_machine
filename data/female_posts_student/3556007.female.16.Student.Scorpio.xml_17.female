I totally fucked up my computer doing God knows what. I haven't seen Brian in over a week except for at Sun night church for about 15 seconds. I have talked to him on the phone, but not that much because I was busy.   I went to Pin OAk downtown on Saturday which was really sad because I went through a "that could be me" phase or whatever. Saw a bunch of people that I know that brought back sad feelings from December. And, of course, whenever we are around Saddlebred people, Dorothy comes up again. Steve is in the hospital because he isn't taking care of himself, drinking, living from social security check to check, etc...   But anyways... Time for homework.
