But it was okay the whole time there was fun. We had like a long time before our race so we were chillin. Matt brought a football so me, Deb, Erica, Danielle, Neil and Matt had a little football game. No mercy baby. That night, which like, made my week, NOTRE DAME WON!!!!!! THEY WON, THEY WON, THEY WON!!! Then, me, Erica, Melanie and Debra went into Annadale and met up with Mariana and Danielle in Angelo's for some pizza. Then, Mariana left, and Danielle came with the rest of us to my house and we watched "Down With Love" and all of us were so ready to just grab a guy and just like... go at it... till next Tuesday... no, make that Friday... yea... Friday sounds good. Then we watched some of Pirates of the Carribean... which hightened the crave even more. Melanie was feeling the most.. um... chocolte-worthy LMAOOOO.. sorry Mel, hadda say it. So, then when everyone left, I watched Holes, it was kinda cute... then, I woke up at 7 am on a SUNDAY and dragged my ass to Bay Street to help hand out water at that half marathon. And Kersha has a VERY noisy stomach hee hee. So that was a blast... yea then I came home and watched "Down With Love" before my mom had to return it. I love that movie. So yea, Matt is gonna come here to my house cause I really don't feel like going out any where... so yea... tomorrow is gonna be boring. I might chill inside, maybe go for a run. Okay, I'm out. Peace x0x0x0x0x
