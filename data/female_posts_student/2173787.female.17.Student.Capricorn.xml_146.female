There may be traces of snow on the ground from last night but that's fine because the sun says that spring is coming.  I'm tired of these threats of snow, of getting my hopes up for a day of snuggling under blankets sleeping because the snow has made it possible for me to cancel all plans and not have any deadlines, of being trapped for days on end in my house with my family, of always being cold.  Spring is in the air and nothing is going to stand in the way.  Anyone want to go to the lake?
