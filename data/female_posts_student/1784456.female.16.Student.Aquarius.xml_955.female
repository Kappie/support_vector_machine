But it any one actually evil? (Oh well) I don't think so. Guess I'm young and niave, but I don't think any one can be pure evil or pure good, every one has a reason for some thing. If you have no reason then why think that? You have to have a reason to think that. (EH?) Ahh well, every one jump into the psychological magical mystery tour! (Hippy clothes required) Hehe, maybe another day cause I'm tired at the moment but... comments any one? We need to get a deep psychological person to say some thing about the whole Iraq thing. I think every one needs it. Hey! Stop looking at me! :P (Yeah, right) Gotta go watch an Arnie film guys! (Wow, totally ruined that whole mature look) Yurpsie! Bisi!
