On my mind - ...No fooking way!?...  ...WE WON! ...We got the award for best play/one-act/whatever... ....Wheeeeeeee! *dances a happy dance* The show went smashingly! We actors performed flawlessly, of course! All of the technical aspects were wonderful. Yay!    .....It snowed this morning.. :) I didn't realize that it was snowing until after I had walked outside. ..And I wore flip-flops again today. :D It felt so good to be standing out in the snow, catching snowflakes on my tongue, and feeling snow fall on my toes and melt... Mmmm, good stuff... I love snow...  Bah, that reminds me... I haven't been snowboarding in over a month and a half... That really bums me out..  I don't have time for it..  Bah...  Hahah.. Jordan--who is in the same play as me and won "Best Male Actor"!-- reminds me of Stewie from Family Guy. He always uses ridiculously big/obscure words and frequently insults people using those ridiculously big/obscure words. I noticed this tonight...Hahahaha... Man, It was good stuff...   ...I have a reseach paper to do for English... I'm actually not too concerned about because the topic is...anything! (As long as it is a contempory issue...) It has nothing to do with English! :) ...except that is has to be written in English... .....Actuuuallly, he didn't specify what language it was to be written in... Mwhahahaha... Too bad I don't speak any other language well enough to write a research paper in it... Last year I wrote a paper in Spanish.. but that was only a little over a page long...  ...Hmm... Oh! Jordan seems to speak Spanish pretty darn good, and Jona does also!... And, oh, oh.. There's the foreign exchange student from Argentina! ....But her English doesn't seem to be too stellar, so I'd be concerned about how well she could translate it.... ....Hah, not like I could actually do that and still get a grade on it...  *snap*   I wrote down some ideas for my topic, and I can't decide which to use... Here they are... 1- Legality of gay marriage, (for) 2-What marriage mean in Hollywood/The value of marriage in Hollywood 3-Legalization of drugs, (for) 4-The effects of censorship on young minds and consquences later in life... (This one seems to have a sciency edge to it, so I don't know whether it'll be acceptable..) 5-Civil rights violations in America today 6-something about a Constitutional admendment to allow foreign born citizens to become President.. ( idea of Arnold Schwarzenegger ) or 7- something else having to do with the Constitution...  ...I was bored when Russel (my English teacher) was going over the requirements and what not, so I turned him out for the most part and just thought of ideas...  Wheeeee...    (Sorry this was so long.)
