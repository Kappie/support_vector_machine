Also, I love the last couple of paragraphs: "The latest Potter film, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, was still in 600-plus screens through last weekend. Since its release June 4, it has earned $244 million--the third biggest hit of the summer.   "Still, the movie is on track to gross less than 2002's Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets ($262 million), which grossed less than 2001's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone ($318 million).    "Wonder if Voldemort's got a spell on how to reverse a downward box-office trend."  Yeah, because  $244 Million Smackers  is just such a huuuge disappointment.
