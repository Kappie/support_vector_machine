You do not know how much I have fallen for you, and you haven't even noticed how much you mean to me.  You do not know anything about me that really matters, and guess what? Who cares.... because the truth is that I don't even know me.  I have yet to find the answers.  I have yet to find out why I do the things I do and think the way I think.  The truth is I want to know me, and I want you to know me.
