I do want to do well so I do have to practice and that means I have absolutely no time to do anything with any of my friends. And I now have to worry about the AP test Friday and solo fest on Saturday.  I hate the drama. Everything is all about the drama. It's stupid and I hate it. I think life would be much better if everything were easier and maybe even boring. Then I wouldn't have to freak out and cry over every little thing and cry   atleast   2 or 3 times a day not counting crying myself to sleep every night. And for those of you who are good enough friends of mine to truely know me, I don't cry that much. I try to hide my emotions from everyone so I'm not seen as vunerable.  Well, I'm going to go eat now. Mac and cheese I guess. Yummm
