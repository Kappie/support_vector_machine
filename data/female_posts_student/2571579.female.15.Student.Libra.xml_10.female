While she was on that carissa called me from Atlantic City and i told her that. Then we started reminising on the dolls we used to play with. I asked my mom to get it outta the back-back closet and found that the cool thing to have when i was 10(ish?) was  Magic Attic  Dolls! So i started playing with mine. Her name is Rose and carissa has the same one. We decided that when she comes back we're gonna play with them together and buy clothes for them.. because they are sold on the streets of scranton haha. Then tonight I went to some festival/picnic i dont even know what it was haha. I think it was in pistton tho. I went with Mandie, Heath, and Matt who all some of my favorite people in the world! While we were there we called about every other person "dirty" and that became the word of the day. I beleive that i started it haah but it was just an overall good time so it doesnt matter. When we were in Mandie's car planning on going home we had a little problem.. the car battery was dead! So she called her mom and they were going to come jump us. For the time being we tried to push the car... in the rain of course. It always rains at times like this haha. But that didn't work. I rang on the doorbell of the house we were in front of but nobody answered. A car was parked in front of ours so even if Mandie's mom came she would have had to go in the middle of the road for the jumper cables to reach. Then the lady who's car it was came (she was at the picnic) and she left and Mandie's mom came so it was all good. Her brother (who's 15) did all the hard work because Matt didn't know what he was doing. haha but Now i can say that i know how to jump a car so it was a good experience. But that's it for tonight. I have camp tomorrow so Ill update then =)   I got a country song that I'm rockin out too.. my love  Tim McGraw.  It's a new one by him so I give it my approval. "I became a friend, a friend would like to have...Some day I hope you get the chance to  Live like you are Dying " .. amazing song that reminds me of my counrty lovin' days
