"it was a nasty storm", my dad said. "holy cow, man", my mom said. "why can't you just sleep in our house, it's expensive here. you people will be really broke", my grandmom said.   then the next day, we went home, hoping that we have power. but we were so absolutely, incredibly, wrong. we still didn't have power, so, we slept in a hotel called "bianca". nothing special, it was $40 dollars, though. i hoped we just slept to "stanford", another $40 dollars, but in my opinion, more better than bianca, no offense. but it was okay, they have channel 15, 16, 17, 18,  19. those channels have great movies. but, we can't afford it in our house, because there's so much bills to pay every month. i watched "chicago" that night. i watched "pirates of the carribean: the curse of the black pearl", in the morning, after my mom and brother watched this, i don't know what's the title show.  i was still sleeping, because that night, when i was about to sleep, my brother filled the whole space that there was nothing left for me. coz, we slept in the same bed, which was so small. then after that, he kept on snoring. well, enough of that. then 12:00 pm we went back home hoping to have power, but again, we were wrong. our water was together with the power. good thing, we had a big tank for everyone in the whole apartment to share. but when we tried to get some more water, it was empty, finish, done. so my grandmom decided for the four of us to go sleep at her house, and so we did. i called my uncle marvin to pick us up. then when we got there, my dad told us that we have to sleep there because there's still no power. so we slept there. my mom asked my grandmom to lend them some, i mean a fan, electric fan, because my dad brought a generator not big enough for an aircon. then when we slept vj, of course, kicked me again. and that's when i draw the line. whenever he kicked me, i pushed his leg back.  then now, which is thursday, july 1, we had power and went back home tonight, coz our parents had works.  bu-bye,  dessa
