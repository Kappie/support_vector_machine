I went to see Gerardo... and then him and Gabor and I walked to GP, so they could see old friends, and so I could see Allie!  And yep, I did!  She's doing good =) And so is Trinity!  She's soooo cute!! =)  But yeh, she wants me to call her more, so I shall! lol... and yeh, I "met" some of Gerardo's friends... they all seem like good people =)  So yeh, for the time I was there, I was Gerardo's Girlfriend... not that I'm not now =P  But yeh, lol, that was my name!  haha, no complaints.  Yep... I had fun, tho.  Then yeh, we went back to his house for a while, and now I'm home!  And YEH, I got an email from Roxie... =O MAN, I'm shocked, and disappointed... Not in her, but in the news I heard.  =( It's a shame.  But yeh, that's all for now!
