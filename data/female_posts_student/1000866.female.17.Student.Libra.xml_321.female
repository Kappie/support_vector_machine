I suppose I could write about it in here considering Joanne is away doing workcrew for camp, but still, I'm not taking ANY chances. None at all. I'll probably write more about working on the project and stuff after her party. Sigh. I'm going to miss her.  Anyway, heh, in other news. It's National Clown Week. Yay? I don't know. I've never been particularily fond of clowns. I mean, I'm not one of those people truly frightened by them, but I find them to be almost a nuisance. I don't think I've ever really seen a clown though in person, and Bozo wasn't ever my favorite tv show. I suppose I'm ambivalent, but really, do we need a whole week to honor those who frighten children and throw pies at each other? Ah well, such is life.  Completely changing the subject. We had "pre marching band camp" last night. It was...errr, interesting. All we did was play music. I'm not sure if I like the show or not this year. I suppose we'll see. And of course all of this reminds me that I need to see American Wedding. If you get the connections in my head here....I'm proud.   I suppose I'd best be off. Mary Clare's giving me a ride, and I like to be waiting when people give me rides. Considering they are kind enough to go out of their way to pick me up, I figure I should at least be prepared.    Au Revoir.   Man, what do I need to take French for this year? I've got this down.
