I am going to get a break and go visit the fam at the new place in Oklahoma for about 10 days between classes. Of course my major professor just told me that I should have the first chapter of my thesis written before I leave! That's on top of doing homework, a group project, taking a final and re-editing a paper four the fourth time. But enough of my whining.There are two guys interning from France here and I got to hang out with them on Friday night.They were alot of fun but its hard to be around them because theirEnglish isn't the best. I hope to spend more time with them before they leave but I don't know if its going to happen. Other thantwo French guys that smell a little too French for me nothing much is happening.Hopefully when the new students get herethings will get a lot more interesting.
