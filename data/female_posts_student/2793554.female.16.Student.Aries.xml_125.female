I dont really have anything to say. im really not as emo as i appear to be in dylans blog. its like in a play when the corny music comes on and the inspiration comes, and BAM! ta-da. just like that. Anyway. I have no idea what im talking about but the moral of the story is i love that boy.  uh. TIME TO GO HOME! or stop writing in my blog, im not really even paying attention or writing coherently so i might as well stop.  ~abby  P.s. wouldnt that be funny if you were in an ic and you looked over and the kid on the computer next to you was looking at porn? haha.  p.s.s. some really creepy bloke (i like the word bloke but i am not british and i dont want to pretend to be british cause thats really dumb and annoying when people do that ::coughcoughTIMSPRINGETTcoughcough:: so this is the ONLY time im using it. Ever.)  keeps smiling at me.  I AM DONE!  TAA-DAAAAAA!  p.s.s.s. i think the guy next to me is drunk... he smells like beer... everybody in europe is drunk.  ok.  NOW  I AM REALLY done.  1 more day of INSANITY IN LONDON! and then i come home. Poop. wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
