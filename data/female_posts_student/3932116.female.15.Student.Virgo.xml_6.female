The big 1-6!... it was great fun, but unfortunately I had muny band and things, so i didn't get to spend ALL day with her, however we did stay up until 1:30 AM playing Mario Party. I had behind-the-wheel yesterday...yes, as my best friend was receiving the "plastic card of freedom," i was enduring my driver's ed instructor tell me when to turn left and right. Oh well. The sad part is that i don't even receive my freedom until sometime in late september...my birthday is in august :o! But that is my reason for not blogging last nite, i wasn't here, i was at my 2nd home. Today, we ventured across the river to Artmart and then to Union Station, and finally to the movies...we saw anchorman! it was alright, Will Ferrell is a comic genius! We ate at Spag...it was really good, too.  I guess while i'm here, i might as well say what was on my mind last nite. We went to drop micheal, one of Dan's friends off in Willow Creek. I think that was the first time that I had been back in Willow Creek since Dexter died. I guess I'm not as over it as I thought. It brought some painful memories back...i guess it showed cuz jess knew...it's still so hard. well, i guess that's it..now that i've thoroughly depressed myself again. I'm so stupid..geez! By the way...Happy Birthday Jess!
