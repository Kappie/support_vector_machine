Which disturbs me, how long have I done this?  Ross once convinced me I was on TV and I waved to the audience.  And another time well the background is you know that commercial with Kermit the frog and everyone in it, the joke is Animal goes "sausages" really loud. And as a joke I'm like he might as well be saying "PENIS", you know sausage=penis.  And I'm like next time u order pizza I'm gonna yell PENIS into the phone, so while I'm sleeping i start saying "sausages PENIS sausages PENIS".  Yeah, really funny.  And then I snore and stuff on top of it, sometimes strip articles of clothing.... weird huh. And I do this WHILE at Ross's house with his parents around.  Grab a chair, my life can be tragically funny...  And so far the sick count is at like five different things, just added a new one the other day.  Have to go to the hospital and all that fun shit. Sugery, whatever.  This coming weekend is our  Party .  Message me if you want in.  "Is our love to savage" - "Well that one time it was weird" - "What when I was drunk?" - sealab 2020  I have come back to loving Pearl Jam and the Vitalogy Album.  It is the old grunge babe coming out, Courtney Love style.  But really it's good.   I don't want to take what you can give... I would rather starve than eat your breast... All the things that others want for me... Can't buy what I want because it's free... Can't be what you want because I'm... I ain't s'posed to be this far Oh, to live and die, let it be done I figure I'll be damned, all alone like I began... It's your move now... I thought you were a friend, but I guess I, I guess I hate you...   urlLink Pearl Jam Courduroy     Like I said I'll get the updates when I get the Pictures in.... and time don't forget I have none of it.
