But I realized that is an awful lot of noise he is making just to eat. So I get up, go peek out my window and what do ya know, it is a raccoon. Not only was it one, but there were two. They walk so funny and they are like human size if they stand on their back legs. I always thought that raccoons would be nice, but I have heard Opossums are more friendly than raccoons. But I do think raccoons are waaaaay more cute. Also, not only have I seen alot of these creatures dead on the side of the road, when I took my little driving lesson through Crown Hill there was a dead one by one of the graves. Now is that like freaky or what? My family has had there idea that our cat Gremlin is part raccoon as well. He doesn't have the markings like one but he sure does walk like one and he makes noises that I believe a raccoon would make. So is it just me, or is there like a whole bunch of these animals?      Moving on,   today was my brother's 24th birthday. So that means my mommy made some of his favorite cookies and I ,of course, got to eat some too! So yeah, I woke up and went out to the cottage to wish him a happy birthday. He showed me all his gifts. His girl-friend had bought him twenty-four gifts. In the huge selection of gifts, he received Cubs tickets. Dang, I want them. He also got alot of other cool stuff, like a watch, cologne called Allure (which smells excellent), some cds, and more. After that I came back in and watched tv, chilled with Dusty some more, and did some chores. I then took a shower. After taking a shower I waiting around for my dad so we could go run some errands. We went to Sears, Foot Locker, Finish Line,Champs, Rack Room Shoes, and many more shoe places cause he is so picky on what he likes. I was tired of looking at shoes! Finally we made it home. Once I got home I looked up an old friend's number. The friend is Derrick. Yeah, last time I saw him was in 8th grade. That was 3 yrs. ago! I called him up and we talked a bit. I promise, that boy is going to be an NBA star..so keep your eyes open for him! He was shocked to know it was me. He seemed just the same has he used to be. I kinda felt dumb calling him though. O well, I did it. At least he knows I was thinking about him and that if he wants me he knows how to reach me. But yeah, that was fun. Now here I sit. It is hottttt. I am ready for the cold front to get to moving through, ugh! I can't believe school starts for IPS tomorrow. Ugh, that's a killer. But why do they only have half days and then start school on a Thursday? That is just gay. I tell ya, I find myself getting more grown up everyday, but also getting more childish everyday. Now does that make sense? I think not. I guess I just have my moments.Hmmm.      Ok, my mind is like bouncing like crazy! I have so many thoughts going through my head at once. I must control myself! Hopefully, I get some stuff accomplished tomorrow. I have so much to do. Well, until next time, I am outtie!      Music Playin' in The Background: You're The Inspiration-Chicago
