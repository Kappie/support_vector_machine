Was sat next to this lovely Swiss guy on the plane who had just spent 4 months in Vancouver with a friend of his and was really upset about leaving too, so we consolled each other!  Is that grace Melanie? Watched 2 good films but one (Big Fish) made me cry and then I started sobbing uncontrollably, fortunately everyone was asleep and so I stuck my head into the pillow and just let it all out.  I didn't sleep at all on the flight so now to my body it is 11:20 am on Monday and I haven't slept since Saturday night.  Am feeling not too tired actually but rather sick. I think it is the Poutin still!  Well I'm not going to blog anymore tonight, but I promise I'll fill in anyone who is reading and wants to know, tomorrow.   Sleep well guys. Enjoy the sunshine for those of you in Vancouver (my parents can't believe I have come back from Canada with a suntan! Mind you they wouldn't understand any of what really happened in Canada and how amazing it was, but hey.)   mex
