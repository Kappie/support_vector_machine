Which all my friends think that I' am a idiot for doing that, I don't though. Some of is stupid friends told me something that really hurt my feelings. They made a comment to me, that I was no Hillary. If you don't know who she is , she is his ex-girlfriend.   That really hurt me. If you have seen Morgan you would also know how HOT he is. He is well built with huge muscles...Chelsey..(sorry inside joke.) If you know me you would know we didn't look good together. I just didn't feel pretty with him. I tired to explain it to soem of my friends, but they just don't seem to understand. All they see is a hot guy, and a stupid dection. Man, it's like I can't seem to find me a good boyfriend. A guy I can just hang out with and have a really good time with. It seems like they are all taken, or they are friends with me. If you also knwo me you know I love all my friends and would NEVER date them. Sometimes I regret being me. Sometimes I love beign me. %-)
