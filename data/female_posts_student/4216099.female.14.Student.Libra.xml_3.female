Ive played DDR for the past 2 nights with my brother..and im going again tonight(Friday) im gonna ask thomas and brandy to go..and maybe Nick. YAY! Its gonna be fun. Then tommorrow im either gonna go to a party since the asian just got back from vietnam...or the attic to see pankake play once again...I need to support em cuz theyr fuckin amazing..brad might hate me but i still love his band lol. Im glad that ice and rabbit are still cool with me tho. And Eze...does he ever hate anyone? lol...and then theyr new dude Ean or somethin..ive never talked to him..he dates jesse...he seems like a brilliant addition to the band tho. They have progressed alot..and thats great. Lets see...sunday and monday ill probably make time for me and nick to go on a date or something alone..cuz we wanna kinda hangout and see if we still have valid feelings for each other...then maybe well become commited =) i hope..lol. Hes such a great guy..and i miss him alot. Then Tuesday me n nick are gonna go pick up our schedules...YIPEE! lol..dude none of us sophmores or freshman even have to go to school the second day lol..thas funny! Um.. last night LIL'T' spent the night. I swear that kid is here every other day. i talked to ****..i was kinda jealous and pissed cuz her bff Chasity who she lives with down in *****..well they fucked or something. And #### told me that i was the only chick she ever liked or somethin..and now shes fucking some other chick..thas fucked up. UM... so i was kinda pissed off last night so that mad her mad and she said "look ill just call you tommorrow" i said "yea go fuck your new gf..and im gonna be gone for a while so ill call you whenever i get back..maybe in a month or so" then we hung up...i was just pissed...oh well. Um..lets see. OMG. Like..i like thomas right? hes a cewtie and hes nice but were best friends..also my friend Tony--we've been waiting to date for a year cuz he was waiting to come back to fairmont to date me but i have a feeling if i start dating nick that im not gonna be single for a while. Then i also have to hang out with Henri this week..he likes me. OMG hes my sisters bf's roomate who's like 17 and he has lip and nipple piercings...UHHHH thats so hot!=) lol... neways...but really what i want right now is to date Nick..cuz hes the only one i know and who makes me happy. If we date its gonna be like a continuation. Almost like we took a 7 month vacation..and then returned. Cuz everything is the same except we havnt been dating lol. Its wierd..um..yes..Man...me and my bro and LILT came up with our excuse and motto for everything..it is "we need to get laid." lol. Whenever we do something stupid...we all get quiet..and say "Dude..we need to get laid" lol haha. OH WELL..im just a sex deprived bitch. Actually i could be fucking the shit out of any chick i wanted and any dude i know would fuck me..so im not really sex deprived..i just choose not to be a whore...lol..Im gonne loose it to another of my kind..a VIRGIN lol. Hey...Nick's a virgin!! =o   And thomas is a virgin! =o.....Jon Henri and Tony arent Virgins...=( oh well..too bad for them..um well im gonna go make arrangments with thomas and brandy..Later peeps..
