The WSU-colors were starting to get to me, so you know.    So today's the first day of having absolutely nothing to do, nowhere to be, and it feels spectacular.  Slept in until 10, didn't get out of bed until 11, watched two episodes of Queer as Folk before even getting in the shower.  Working on my pile of laundry now and pumped out three, count 'em THREE morning pages!  And it's only 2!  Think the only time I'll leave the abode is to take back the DVD and the rest of the day will be spent puttering around, perhaps cleaning, perhaps not, and starting some new books.  I've been instructed by more than one person to read the Harry Potter series, collected 1 through 4 from Emily last night, and as I find myself in between books, it only seems right to dig in this afternoon.    H'ok, so...the morning began drenched, soppy and gray.  Now it's sunny, blue skies and only marginally warmer.  Still going to watch it from inside.  It's such a day to sit, do very little, but relish every moment and every thought; letting everything surround you, settle and swirl inside.  Have so much to bask in and now that I'm letting myself to precisely that, it feels terrific.  On the second round of the Frou Frou CD, with no sign of stopping.    Suppose I could describe the person more than partially responsible for all this, seeing as how the majority of you readers know nothing other than what has already been posted here.  It may be a bit disjointed and random, but perhaps just right, too.  Hope she doesn't mind.  She's a hero in the making.  Already is in so many ways and can't wait to finish the journey.    She wants to be five years older because she's outgrown her contemporaries and so wants to be the person she knows she's becoming.    She shares Karen's (of the Jack and Karen hour) mentor.    She's loyal to a fault.  She laughs easy, loud and often.  She's generous with herself, but fiercely protects her vulnerability.  She'll make an elaborate meal for her friends and go to bed with a peanut butter sandwich for herself.  She reminds me of someone I used be.    She's spontaneous, charming and kind.   She lives in the moment, and not one has been the same since she walked through the Boy's door.
