We got there right when it opened to avoid the crowds, only to find that everyone else was thinking the same thing, thus ironically creating a mob of hot sticky bodies bumping into each other's purses while milling about.  It was like Disneyland in the summertime without the characters prancing around.  Good thing my dad was there to carry my bag filled with jumbles of papers and folders from various colleges trying to sell themselves.  I felt annoyed by some of the representatives who acted like obnoxious car salesmen.  I think it makes for a poor representation of their organization and is a total turn-off to prospective students like myself.  Nonetheless, the evening went well overall.  After that, we went out to Apple Bee's to dinner because my parents, who are on Weight Watchers, wanted to see their new Weight Watchers inspired menu.  Disappointingly, it had not been issued yet.  But they still had some good, healthy food for them to gorge themselves with.  Since it was near sundown, there was an unbearable reflection piercing my eyes.  I politely aksed the waitress, a woman in her mid-twenties who owned an acne infested face worse than any teenager I know, if she could put down the adjacent blinds.  She huffed and puffed trying to release the stubborn blinds into their resting position, but to no avail, she had to call the manager.  He couldn't get them down either.  Then people from the surrounding tables got up to try; again, no success.  Embarrassed for asking such a troublesome request of the waitress, I sank down into the booth and hid behind my sunglasses, with eyes tearing from the scorching sun's relentlessness.  Then I came home.  Thumbed through the college info, taking notes and discussing things with my parents.  When I got tired of that, I turned on the season finale of Friends (eyes teared once again).  And now I sit here.  Telling you about my day.  The end.
