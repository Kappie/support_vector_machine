Each week, I'll give you a prompt (for example, the one from yesterday) and for the other prompt, you will be invited to either post your own writing for people to read/respond to AND/or respond to a second prompt. We'll see how this works. Even though things can be read by anyone searching through the blog, I believe that keeping the response contained will make things run much more smoothly.  Thanks.
