I just don't know how I'm going to graduate and join the workforce and be a grown up. I have no fucking plan, and I don't know what the point is. This whole college thing seems like another vast holding pen to keep an entire age group out of the work force. And thanks to the loverly economy we live in, I'm not going to get hired immediately out of college and into a high paying bullshit dot-com job. Goddamn you late 1990s! Why did you have to leave us poor kids in 2004 with such beautiful visions of what would happen if twentysomethings ruled the world? Well, we saw it, people lost a lot of money, and you can bet your ass that wall-street won't let it happen again. So, lately it's been looking like elementary school might be a good place to teach. Hell, I'd get paid more and get better benefits than some poor adjunct professor in history with a Ph.D. It makes 2nd graders seem more appealing somehow. And if they act up, I'll be bigger than them, unless there's some poor hormonal kid. But the kid'll be a freak anyway, I won't have to deal with him. He'll go to the tough but nice special ed. teacher that everyone secretly fears because no one wants to be a special ed. kid. There was always something a little off about the kids in his class. They were weird, and would scream for no apparant reason sometimes.
