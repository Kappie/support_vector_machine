I am going to be in the air for 4 hours so I will have time to write some drafts of posts to come. Like I said earlier, Ian is going to take over some posting! Yay! He finally gets responsibility! Anyway, We are heading in early so I must finish packing, and I will see you all in a week!  Kisses for Marty and Ian
