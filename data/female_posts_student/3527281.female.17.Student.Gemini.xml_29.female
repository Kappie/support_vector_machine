You're pretty tripped out, even though you've been known to be a bit boring at times. You manage to serve your purpose in life while expending hardly any effort (and are probably stoned to the gills all the while).   Well last time I checked, I've never been stoned....   Which old school Nickelodeon show are you?  You are WILD AND CRAZY KIDS.  You couldn't get through life without a little fun... or a neon colored t-shirt.  You are a team player and really into Omar Gooding.  GO YOU!   Which Finding Nemo Character are you?  YOU ARE CRUSH!  Awwwww...I love Crush, dude!!  Well that is all for now. I'm at my grandparent's house right now. I will update with a REAL update later. Until then, byes!  PS. I redid this because it messed up my whole blog, but I just left what I was without the pictures.
