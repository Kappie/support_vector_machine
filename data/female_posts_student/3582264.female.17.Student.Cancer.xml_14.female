I was talking to my aunt and she said that my Uncle Jack had called her and asked her how many social functions she thought i would want to go to. She told him that i probably was going to DC more so to sight see and visit Joanna than anything else, so no more than two, IF ANY. So he apparently called her back and told her to tell me to bring one long and one short formal dress (this is of course without talking to me or getting my input at all, but whatever) So I went out and had to buy a formal long dress, i have a short one, but not a long one, so yeah.... It's neat, it's simple, but rather elagant. I like it, and i'll be able to use it for a school dance, so it works out. (I wish i knew what it was for though....)  2. I am now afraid to drive with my window rolled down I was driving on the highway a few days ago, and they had just put down a bunch of gravel, so the speed limit was 20mph, of course no one was doing even close to that, since it's normally a 50mph road. This car drove by me, superfast, and kicked up a bunch of rocks that flew into the window and hit me in the head. It hurt, and even cut the side of my face a little. Not fun.... Then, today, i was driving to Brett's house, and i was talking to my mom on the phone, and i felt something kinda hit me in the head, so my first thought was, "oh great! I just got crapped on by a bird, so i feel my head, and there was nothing there, so i let out a sigh of releif, and then i looked down at my shoulder, and there was a yellow jacket there, just hanging out on my shoulder, and i SCREAMED! My mom started freaking out cuz she thought i had just gotten in an accident, and then i started screaming "THERE'S A BEE ON ME! THERE'S A BEE ON ME!!!" and so she told me to pull the car over, and get out, and i pulled the car over, but said, "I don't want to move, it's gonna sting me!!!" and then after a few minutes of this I finally got out and tried to get it off by moving my shirt, but it was haging on good, so i brushed it off, screamed again, ran into my car and rolled up the window.  I swear, i was all jittery all the way to Brett's house.  FYI: I hate bees.  -Ali
