Well since I got home I have been playing about with my new 6 in 1 hair straightener. I love the curler and have been trying out leavers ball hairstyles! Yipeee. I gave up an hour ago though, kinda burnt my hand about 3 times or so.    I think the fire fighers should wait, they will get more attenion if they wait until the stuff about Iraq has all gone, or at least got canceled.  It won't be canceled. War cannot be canceled, postproned but never canceled.
