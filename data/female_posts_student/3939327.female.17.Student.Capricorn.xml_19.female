Autobiographies about struggle and accomplisments. Texts filled with scientific and historic facts.  A few quotes of mine; I said I would post. You might not agree, and that is all right. My friend Amy Lee wrote "Unity Through Diversity"  Crying is not a weakness. Losing faith in yourself is a vulnerability.  Relinquish all indolence and you shall find vigor. *how the freak do you do that? well, don't question me. question yourself :-P  It is immodest to use profanity.
