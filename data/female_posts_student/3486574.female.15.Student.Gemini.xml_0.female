Haiz..today is the "Meet Parents' Day". And of course, i'm included. (as usual though coz almost everybody else have to go) Miraculously, my father decided to sent me n my mother to school...(it is unusual of him to do that, since he always prefers staying at home and sleep all his want since it is a day off for him as it's the holidays for the students, and he need not teach) Well, it's been raining ever since I woke up. And it only stops until now. The weather is kind of cool...pretty good for time to take a nap...Felt like cuddling up my pillow n goes to sleep..Haha. But alas! I've to go to school in such a weather. And redeem my results slip.  Cool as it is, bright as it seems...but there'isnt alot of students around that time...Guess every other students chooses a time as early as 10 to collect theirs...and only a couple of unlucky teens (like me) choose such a time where everyone is back at home, watching tvs and enjoying themselves...11.45 am is the time.   The first thing i saw when I entered the school...was DT! With 3 other pupils...Yep, all 3 of them are from my class...Dont know what's up with them...and DT...As far as I know, they must have commited something wrong that DT wanted to see all 3 of them. And from their faces, they aren't looking kinda good. Trying not to be nosey, I dragged my mom to my class...where Mr Wong (my form teacher) is.   Well, guess we were the last ones to be seen...There's someone in there...someone familiar...Ok, it's my sort of father's sister's son. (Well, I dont know how to call it, a long-distance relative, maybe?) Anyway, he was there...together with his...erm mother. At first glance, I thought it was my aunt. but then again when they came out, it was not. It took about 15 minutes for them before they come out from that room. And when they came out, his mother greeted my mom. And then when we entered, the first thing mr Wong said wad "Your related one ar?" And I nodded...  And here it goes....my result slip. It doesn't looks pretty nice...I failed 2 subjects. Haiz...Oh well, guess I've to buck up for my final year..just like what I did last year! I aimed to get back my position for Top 10! Muahahahaha... I've noticed....I always get a pretty lousy results for Mid Year Examinations....and only when Final Year, then my results are of the better. This year, I'm not going to let my parents down either! Afterall, it's an important year! =D  Mr Wong goes on and on about how I can improve on it...and I'm determined to prove that I can do well...and I am made of something! Lolx.. He even suggested me to buy the Ten Year Series books to practise on. And oh yeah, he even asked for my home number...I sure hoped he won't call when I'm least expected. After all, I'm a good student!   Yawn...it's 3pm now..Guess I've got to stop. Today's kind of ok. I'm so bored with nothing to do now...Maybe I should go back on reading the comics...And I just can't wait for tomorrow! Haha, coz I'm going out to redeem the Jolin's Concert Tickets...Well let's hope that at least I could get them.   Laters!
