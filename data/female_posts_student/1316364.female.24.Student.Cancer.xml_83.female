Today I watch him, as he is idle on his computer most likely due to him working on someone’s computer or tweaking his or something along the lines of that. I am not to sure what his shift looks like for today but I am going to wait here in hopes I get to talk to him before he is off shift. The way its been going ever since C Co. has taken over the position that Bravo Co. once maintained at the camp Jesse is at, we can never make heads or tails out of a stable work schedule which poses a slight strain on communication but I am grateful for the time we do get and I am so thankful that they have computer access there and at their disposal if needed.   In other news, I have reconnected with an old friend of ours named Melissa, and loving every chance I get to talk to her. She is exactly what I need right now and she lives very close to my mom’s so that just makes everything so much better. She is coming over to my mom’s on Tuesday and is going to help me move some things out of my Mother-in-laws because my M-I-L was nagging/yelling at me to come get it, long story. So Melissa offered her services and we are going out to storage on Tuesday.   Melissa has also helped me out with the FRG Newsletter. I told her that I was going to hire her on as a helper because she went in search for images to go with this article I had in the newsletter. I am trying so hard to make this issue work and also be a great source of information to those who read it. I guess my expectations are high but it is very exciting for me to be able to do this, even though I was very reluctant at first. I feel I am doing a good service for those who can’t be actively involved with the FRG due to place of residence or conflict in work schedules. These people need to be treated like they are a part of the FRG even though they can’t be at the meetings and events; they need to feel like they are being thought of too.   Tomorrow is a big day for the HHC FRG, we have two events going, 1) Boxes for Builders, where care packages are made and shipped to all of the Soldiers of HHC, and 2) the 319th Battalion wide 4th of July Barbeque/Picnic. I have been asked to attend both events and will be photographing them as well. I hope to be able to do a little write up regarding tomorrow’s event for the Newsletter as well.  Then on Sunday I get to go to a concert (the 8th Annual Day in the Zone) with my Brother-in-law and Big Sister. They are taking me as an early birthday present. I can’t wait because I get to see one of my favorite bands play, (((TRAIN))), Melissa Ethridge and Live are also going to be there… oh yeah and William Hung from American Idol (woo hoo… please note the sarcasm on that one).   Overall I know that this weekend is going to be the best ever and I am happy to be a part of the events taking place.  I am definitely keeping myself busy, busy, busy.
