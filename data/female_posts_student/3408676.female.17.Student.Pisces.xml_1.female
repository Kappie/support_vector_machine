BIG MISTAKE !!! Mike, Shane, Kait, and Chris were there waiting to leave and Mike was being in one of his show-off and be an ass moods that I fucking hate, AND THEN just when we thought it was safe Nick showed up (((TOTALLY UNEXPECTED))) expecially since I didnt know he would have enough balls to just be there with us after the whole "thing"...(yes lets call it a thing)...Soooo of course Mike didnt want to go out and smoke me a butt with just me anymore, he wanted me to go out there WITH NICK, common now! DUH! Like I'm really gunna do that...after him being so mean to me the whole time, he wanted me to be in the same room with the boy that he had been icnoring me for to comfort him b/c GOD-FUCKING-FORBID that he could lie in the grave he had doug for himself ALONE. So yeah THEN Mike left with Nick and Chris after he asked me if i wanted to go and i didnt answer, but im sure even if i would have said that we could have, he would have made up some lame excuse why i souldnt go so he can fuck Nick in the ass...God i hated that...I hate yesterday...I hate Nick...(eventhough I never really did...i just desided to- just now) AND OF FUCKING COURSE Mike had to talk about our...ummm sexual experinces- i guess i'll call em...yeah in frunt of everyone, like it doesnt always bother me like when we all high-fived in the bathroom after we all had sex (not all 4 of us together) haha...but its different when he talks about it when were all NOT drinking and infrunt of Kait- its not like i dont want her to know its just that i feel kinda aquard ya know? like shes an older girl and its intimading enough as it is....ERG i hate him...and he didnt call me lastnight eather...what the fuck what a bad day, and yesterday, i must go home and smoke a joint with my best friend and fix my computer....And Nate...yeah is so hot! I want him...i really really really do... we gave him a ride home yesterday, hes a good guy...so nice-gave me the best butt ive ever had...camel menthol, but called something defferent though...Ive wanted him since fucking freshmen year...shit some day we will do much more than make out at a 311 concert :P  well that made me feel a little better...untill next time
