Thursday is a bad day, but is also a good day because Friday follows and Friday is a good day.  you see, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday I have no school. Which means I have no overdue essays, no art projects, no homework. Nothing! Thursday I have my human biology exam. That is bad. Yuck. Three hours of sitting at a desk writing answers to some sixty five questions that I don't know anything about.  so to make up for no school on these other days I have to study this exam for two hours to make sure I at least pass. But hey, two hours of study is better than six of school. I'd take that any day.  so today, I'm free. Nothing to worry about, no hassles, just give the house a quick face lift, and undo the knot in my room, that's it!  yay..  no credit though... damn.
