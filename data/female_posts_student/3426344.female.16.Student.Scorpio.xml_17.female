Most ppl have heard me sing...cuz my friends and I like to make up retarded songs in our spare time...we have one called "Paranoia" and it's awesome! :-P  Hey does anyone else here have AIM?  if you do and you ever wanna IM me sometime my sn's sillyKUHNIGGit44. :-D Cuz I have no life and i'm usually on almost all the time.
