Well... it's more of a hurricane.  My throat feels okay now because i'm well doped up. the prob is that this medication keeps me up and hyper... i didn't take any all day, so i could sleep. I woke up at 11am, then went back to bed at 2pm and got up at 11pm! By then I felt like pure poop-on-a-stick!  My mouth was dry and coated in a thick jelly of saliva. I could barely breath! Yuck, right? "Yeah, definately, yuck... yeah yeah... yuck." so sayth RainMan.  Anywayz, so here I am up at the crack of 3:30am... and just signing online to talk to my new chat buddy (check out his blog at  urlLink http://journals.aol.com/mikeurthy1/PeoplesPlace/ )  I just listened to "Pieces of Me" by Ashley Simpson... the chick has a much better voice than her sis... I'm not against Jessica or aything, but I totally HATE the faces she makes when she sings! She looks like a carp gasping for air!  Well... I'm off for now... if you wanna see some of my poetry, check out  urlLink http://www.postpoems.com/members/soupygirl
