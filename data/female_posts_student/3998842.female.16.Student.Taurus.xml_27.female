Will we both remain?   Will we both be lost?   Is it worth the risk for the gain   No matter the cost?   You know we'd both give anything   To know you belong to each   And yet the choices of your heart are remaining   Too distant, far out of reach   I was not the one pleading   I never wanted you to choose   But now I lie here bleeding   Your love, my life, I'll lose   Inside you know you like the hurt   Knowing that our souls will burn   And as we three play our charade,   Our time runs thin with each passing day      ~fin~      A/N: also written long, long ago. kind of seems ridiculous, all that emotion, now. I guess it's always a little different when you look back on it. Thanks to Ruoxi, who put up with me *through* all of it. I LOVE YOU! Not that you'll ever read this...
