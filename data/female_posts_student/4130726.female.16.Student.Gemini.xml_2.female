I've stopped going on messenger now, It's a waste of my time. I've been going outside more often, I love the early fall weather. The smell in the air is indescribable. My dad is cranky in the morning sometimes. I hate that. Yesterday, I had this awful dream. Some crazy abusive bomb maniac kidnapped me and threatened to kill me if I told. I escaped by telling the police, he tried to blow up my school, but I found out and the teachers evacuated everyone. The police caught him and arrested him in the end of the dream. Things like that scare the hell out of me. The internet is a terrible thing. Its a deathtrap, almost. Some people know nothing other than the internet and they stay in their homes all day. Somebody out there pray for my brother, his name is John. He needs someone to reach out and help him. I'm trying, someone please pray for him. I would really appreciate it. Today is nice, I woke up early today. I love mornings, they are beautiful here. The sun shines just right. I don't think anyone close to me knows about this blog. I'm keeping it a secret pretty much. I think it would be awkward sharing this to my family.
