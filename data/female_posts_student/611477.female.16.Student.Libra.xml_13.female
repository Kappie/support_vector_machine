A bit smaller than the last, but it was quite a bit less knitting - besides making only one handle/strap/whatever instead of two, I made one set of sides shorter.   Instead of square-like, it's more rectangle-like.    The full saga!  Using some wool I dyed with Kool-Aid a couple weeks bag, I picked out a ball of Grape and cast on somewhere around 40 stitches.  I never did do an exact stitch count until I got to the strap.  I knit with that colour until I ran out.  It was about a square.  Picked up a bunch of stitches all around.  I'd used a provisional cast on; nice change of pace from picking up stitches.  Then I did a bunch of decreases on the picked-up sides since it'd be shrinking lengthwise and I didn't want wonky sides like on the last.  (Would not picking up as many stitches the first time around have caused holes or weakness on the base?  I didn't want to find out.)  Knit a bunch of rounds with the different colours I'd made until I got tired of that.  (Colours: Red, light red, light red and purple, purple, dark purple and red, red and purple, and red.  And another couple of balls of some solid colour.  I didn't split the skein evenly. :) )  Last couple of rounds I knit with some leftover eyelash yarn from the parrot's wings.  I followed the stitches up from the corners of the base and put markers somewhere around there and put the stitches from the cast on sides (what ones wouldn't shrink as much) on holders for the strap.  For the other edges (which would shrink as much as they wanted) I p2tog across a row and then bound off fairly tightly.  Came out pretty much as I'd planned.   Amazingly enough, when I got to the end of that binding off ordeal, the ball of wool and the ball of eyelash each had under 2 feet left.  I didn't plan it that way!  You think I'd really unwind the eyelash stuff to find out? (Didn't think so.)  Anyways, back to the strap.  Did a couple symmetrical stripes which I am quite pleased with.  Bound off.  Felted.  So yeah, that was probably boring to read. (Sorry.)  Yeah, if you've already done a couple of these that's not so original.  Well thankyouverymuch, I didn't read any pattern which tightened up the sides as I did. Neener neener!  Yeah, yeah, it's been a long day and I'm going to adore myself, thankyouverymuch.  Pictures coming when I get the newspaper out of the bag.  (Yeah, I'm actually shaping it this time!  What a novel idea!)  Now swatching for my next mystery tank.  Wonder how it will turn out WITHOUT twisted stitches?
