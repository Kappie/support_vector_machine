Last Sunday I did not go to church so my mom is kicking me out of the house. I am to be emancipated on May 13 the day after my sixteenth birthday.  My uncle will help me out financially and stuff but I just cant live with him. My whole family is trying not to piss her off so no one will take me. That's why I have to get my own apartment.  Today I came home to find empty boxes in my room so I am going to go ahead and pack right now ill see yall later.
