(an actual thought! wow!!) even more surprisingly, this was a good thought.  i was thinking about the fact that i am really too attached to my posessions, and that i really wanted to give something to the street kids in rio, brasil, and then it hit me that i could either sell all the stuff i really don't need and give the money to them or i could just send stuff like clothes etc to them direct, through a charity i know. how cool! also i was pondering what to do for my 16th birthday, which is next month, and i thought instead of having people buy me presents i could ask them to donate money to the street kids, and i could have some sort of party which would be very cheap to run, if not free, where we'd have fun and then i could explain briefly what they'd donated to. it's so cool! plus i really think the lack of all this extra "stuff" in my life would really clear my mind more to think about my studies, and (far more importantly) about god. yay!! all i have to do is two things 1) figure out what this party would actually consist of and 2) convince mum and dad!!  plus, i am so becoming a fully fledged hippy...not only am i a vegetarian, i wear tye dye and long floaty dresses with bells, i play acoustic guitar, i like walking barefoot and i want a volkswagen hippy van when i can drive, but im giving away half my wordly posessions! all i need to do now is smoke pot... (joke)
