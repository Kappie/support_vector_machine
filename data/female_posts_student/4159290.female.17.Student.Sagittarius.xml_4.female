I read it a few times, then just sat there for a few minutes, cuz I wasn't sure what to think, then I called  him, and we talked for about an hour, and I cried like three different times, cuz apparantly, to Tom, if we're not getting back together, then that means that our entire relationship was just one big mistake and nothing but a bunch of bad memories...  *sigh* that's a real ego booster, lemme tell ya...  Anyways, then I called David, since I was all upset, and he helped me a lot.  Then I had some Ben  Jerry's (for breakfast) and just chilled for a few minutes, and then I was all better.  Then awhile later I had to take the garbage to the dump/recycling center.   I hated having to change outta my PJs to go out for not even 10 minutes, cuz the place is just right down the road.  haha, I'm so lazy.  Then I just basically spent the day on the computer... of course.  We were gonna go hiking or something when Daddy and Cindy got home from work, but I was still tired from the day before.  They considered going anyway, but they decided to stay home, which turned out to be a good thing, cuz there was a really strong thunderstorm.  It didn't last very long, though.  As soon as it started pouring, Daddy was like, "see, I told you we should have gone kayaking.."  It was amusing.  Then it started lightning, and Daddy turned off the desktop/dsl/router, so I was forced to do something else for about 30-45 minutes.  So I got out these beads Cindy bought me earlier this summer and made a necklace with some fishing line.  I finished stringing the beads, but I haven't determined how I'm gonna make the closure part yet.  Well, I'm $175 richer now.  Daddy bribed me... more or less.  We were planning on going to Boston this weekend, and Daddy was like "I'm not sure if we should go cuz it's supposed to be raining all weekend," and I was like, "well, that won't matter," and he was like, "yeah, it'll mess up our hiking," and I was like, "hiking!?  we're not going to Boston to hike!  we're going to shop!"  and then he was like, "shopping!?  if you wanna shop, we can just go to Freeport," (this city about an hour and a half or two hours away) and I was like, "...but..  I wanna go to Boston..."  So then a few minutes later, Daddy was like, "ok, we can go to Boston.. or we can go to Freeport and I'll give you $150 to spend.. you have 10 minutes to gimme an answer."  And I totally wasn't expecting that.  So I started frantically looking online for stuff to do in Boston, to see if I could stand not going.   (btw, the  urlLink musuem of science  there has a laser show to Dark Side of the Moon, which sounded really neat.  and a lotr exhibit I was *dying* to go to...)   Then a lil bit later, he was like, "ok, 175.  and you have three minutes now," so I reluctantly opted for Freeport and the money..  That much money's hard to turn down.  And we decided not to go to Boston cuz of the rain, cuz we need to spend more than a weekend there, and cuz my energy still isn't totally up to par.  But I told him he has to take me before I graduate college.  And I haven't really done anything today either.  Spent a couple hours on the computer when I woke up, took a shower, talked to David, and cleaned my room up some.  And now I'm fixin to take a nap...
