So he 'walked' away from me, I say 'walked' because it was all done over the internet.  I am going to avoid msn now because then people have to do things to me face to face.  I have explained so many times that I don't need time to cool off etc I have to talk about things there and then...but because he was thinking of 'us' he went anyway.  SO when I get sworn at and taken the piss out of I can think of 'us' and go away too.  I don't think I would be this upset still if I had been allowed to talk about it last night.
