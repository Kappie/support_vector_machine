I figured it would be a short trip for me if I was stoned. And I was rite, woke up after four hours of the boring car ride and we was there in South Lake Tahoe. To me it seem like an hour.    The snow was beautiful as how I remember it was from the last time we were there. I didn’t do much talking this time. I sat way in the back sit sleeping, playing textris and keep quiet. I didn’t want to conversate with Ben either or anyone else.     Once we got to the hotel, unpacked, rested, then off we went straight to the buffet at Harrah’s. The wait was an hour. I must admit that I ate so much. Everyone was so shock when they saw my plates. After dinner we went straight for the casino. I spend 20 bucks on the pai gaw table and another 20 bucks on the wheels of fortune slots.  I end up winning 100 from the slots after three whole hours. By this time I was drunk, I had two bottles of Heineken, a bottle of corona and two shots of remy.      Eleven o’clock no one wanted to leave, I went straight to the bar and started flirting with the bar tender, and she was hot. Blonde, cute smiles, big boobies. Damn what else could I ask for? I didn’t know if she wanted me to go away or did she wanted me to stay but she kept giving me free shots. I took another three shots of remy and I was gone gone gone.    My friends found me and I was throwing up everywhere, we all got kicked out because of me after that I was knock out. We headed back to the hotel, what every happened after that I didn’t remember. I slept like a baby. I didn’t remember a thing.    The alarm went off at six in the morning. I didn’t want to go, all I wanted to do was sleep. Waking up with a hangover wasn’t so nice at all. I was mean and grouchy. Shower, put on our snow pants, snow jackets, load four boards into the car, got everything and everyone and off we went to mickey d’s.   Nine in the morning, we head out to heavenly resort. At last we come to it, breathing in fresh morning icy cold crispy thin air. At last, yes, its time to gear up, got our boards check, my camera check, my beanie check, my gloves check, my Chap Stick check, my glasses check, everyone was ready check, got our lift ticket check. We were all good to go; off we went onto the ski lift. I sat with Ben again, we were so calm, and it was so peaceful, we didn’t say a word to each other, then off the lift we went. The landing was smooth, everyone finishes strapping in and double check all their bindings and off we went.   An hour went by, everyone was having so much fun. We scrub, we fell, I flip so many times, and we were all just having a blast, having a great time, the greatest moments of laughers. Up the lift, down the hill, up the lift, off the lift and down the hill again. Damn, it was so fun I miss it already.  Had lunch at twelve and off we went on the ski lifts again.   The day was over and back to the car, back to the hotel room, rested and packed. I stay inside the hotel room chatted online with Andy, while everyone else was having a great time in the Jacuzzi.  A couple of hours past by we were ready to roll. Had dinner at mickey d’s and we were on our way home. I was exhausted, I slept the whole way back and I was sober…  Said good bye to the beautiful mountains in Tahoe and I shall see you again in March.
