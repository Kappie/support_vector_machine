Almost every one of the bloggers I know has some serious emotional shit going on!    Is it weird to feel a little guilty that I'm not depressed?  Yeah, I thought so.  If its any consolation, I just watched Cold Mountain and cried.  Steve hates tragic endings.  I happen to think it makes a film that much more romantic.  Eh, go figure.  Anway, my heart breaks for all you guys going through a tough time.  If you need anything, just holler.  I hope y'all feel better soon.
