This upset him, but he let it go. She then brought out his chili, and again her thumb was in the food. He let it go again. When she brought out his hot fudge sundae, her thumb was in the food and this was too much for him. "Goddammit," said the man, "get your damn thumb out of my food!'   "Well, I injured it a while ago and the doctor said I should keep it warm."   "Why don't you just shove it up your ass?" the man said angrily.   "That's what I do when I'm in the kitchen."
