I'm beginning to realize that I need to pick a path and follow it, because I'm not going to get anywhere just sitting around waiting for things to happen. I have no skills.  Other than the massively depressing state of my "career," Jerm and I have set a date for our wedding, so we can now begin the countdown: June 25, 2005. Yay! Mark your calendars people. Maybe soon I'll send out save the date emails and notes.
