I just thought that I would let you all know that I'll be blogging for the rest of the week in Canada, and I'll probably be online a little bit at night, too.      Last song I listened to:   Magic  by Ben Folds Five.    Last album I listened to:   The Unauthorized Biography Of Reinhold Messner .    Last meal I ate:  Roast beef sandwich.    Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .    Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .    Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I just randomly burst into singing "Birdland" while I was packing this evening.    Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I took a look through my chem binder while I was going through old school stuff.    Last person I talked to:  Moe.    Favorite song today:   Careless Whisper  by Ben Folds.    Favorite food today:  Nothing in particular.    Most interesting thing I did today:  Absolutely nothing interesting.    Funniest thing that happened today:  I read through some of David's old school assignments, like poetry books and the such. I hope he never pursues a career as a poet, and that is all I can say :P.
