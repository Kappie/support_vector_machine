I haven't blogged for a few days also, with the business of being at church camp and all, so I have a lot to tell.  I just got off the phone with B not too long ago.  So far, I think we're handling this term of separation pretty well.  I would do almost anything to see him right now, but I think I've come to the point of accepting that this just isn't possible.  Last night he had the idea that we should spend the first half of our vacation in Portland.  I thought this was an excellent idea and I did a flurry of research on how much it would cost to make that trip possible.  It turns out that it would cost a ridiculous amount of money--$321 MORE to go to Portland.  A roundtrip ticket from Boston would cost B $448!  To B, that was pretty much a closed door, but I would have gladly paid the expense if it meant seeing his parents, Tom, Pastor Kurt, and his other friends.  Yes, it's a lot of money, but it would have been worth it.  I don't regret the decision not to go, though, because such a high expense really  is  a closed door.  We will have plenty of other opportunities to go to Portland during Thanksgiving and Christmas time.  Still, it would have been nice to go during the warmer months, but maybe next year...
