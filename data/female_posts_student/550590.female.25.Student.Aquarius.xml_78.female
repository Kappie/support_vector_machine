Why hasn't someone clued the McDonald's advertising folks into the fact that the Spice Girls broke up a long, long time ago? 2. Why did I drink that beer after dinner? 3. How did I end up with bras all over my living room floor? 4. How early is too early to start packing up my apartment? 5. When is Dave gonna come get the damn cow dishes already? 6. Am I really leaving Florida for a whole week tomorrow?  I am procrastinating on procrastinating at this point...
