God. but thats enough about all that jazz.       theres one more thing that makes life a complicated thing..the heart. plain and simple. theres someone who used to always be there for me. picked me up when i needed it. unfortunately, i havent been able to talk to this person in quite a while. and now i dont know what to do. should i hang on and see what happens? let go so i dont get hurt? its a hard choice. i dont wanna hang onto something that i wont be able to have in the future.. cuz then it'll be really weird having to see him everyday and know that we wont ever be anything more than friends, and i had gotten my heart set on the   two of us being together some day.. i guess you can't live a fairytale..
