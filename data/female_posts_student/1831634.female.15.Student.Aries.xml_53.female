I'm so tired of seeing my movie group it's not even funny.  good thing is, we got a whole lot done today.  =)  but I got all wet.  and cold.  and yucky.  and it wasn't that fun...  well, it was fun, but yeah.  chuan makes me feel nervous.  he keeps getting too close to me.  so I keep running away from him.  and it feels awkward as freaking heck.  I don't like it.  at all.  which is why I spent a good part of the time in the creek hovering around jack.  to get away from chuan.  grr.  man.  I've still got hot zone to do.  oh, well.  I can't get used to the fact that school is TOMORROW, for heaven's sakes.  which means I oughta get to sleep soon.  SOON.  yeah.
