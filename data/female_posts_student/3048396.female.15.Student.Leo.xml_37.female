I was just happy not to long ago...and now...Im all downhill. I should be all happy n excited because I finish my room tomorrow and then going camping with Tracy on Wednesday. I don't know why Im so down. Ross? Probably. I just miss him way to much...and it hurts more n more everyday. Only 3 weeks till I see him. Thats -way- to long. *sigh* Another reason im probably down-ish...is cuz the only thing I've listened to in the past hour is the Reason. Dumb me. I know it gets me down sometimes...puh. Im just emotional. Way to emotional. *sigh* It seems like I complain bout missin Ross to much...Im sorry...its probably annoying or "old" but eh...I have no other way to express feelings...so here they go...So anyways...Im just feeling quite down tonight....hopefully when I write again I'll be up and happy....Hopefully.
