We then went to 32nd Street and bought her tickets for Magic Mountain since Mica's car can't get on base....hello, Mica, have your parents put a sticker on it...DUH!  (just kidding Mica).  We then went to mica's pad and it was so nice seeingher parents.  They LOVED the kids.  I like going there because they treat us like family. Then we had a very nice time just hanging out at her place.  She has a very nice place.  I liked the carpet.  I want carpet like that, I have already decided.  Ed helped her with her car.  She has bad luck, I know this because it isnt' anything new with us.  When cars have problems, they usualy coem in pairs, triplets, so on and so forth...haha  So anyway, he changed her oil and told her she has a screw in her tire.  Oh, we love getting bolts in ours...don't ask.  So after all that, we went to Goonie Central.  It was so nice to see everyone again.  Mica has a great set of base friends.  I mean these are the friends you grew up with.  It is always cool seeing them together.  I can't imagine being that close with your childhood friends continuously.  We have close family friends...aka our Carson cousins, but there was a BIG gap in the interaction department...but we are fixing that and trying to see each other more.  I am glad because they have always treated us as family, even though our last names weren't FONTELA.  LOL  I remember having such a complex when I realized I wasn't a Fontela.  Anyway, back to the luau at Goonie Central.  They had a nice turn out and everyone was so laid back and it felt like we were part of the group.  That was nice especially since Leila and Mica aren't together anymore...it was nice that everyone was still cool about everything...you know?  So I saw Cece and said hi when I saw her.  Bur I figured to make an example of myself...I am always telling Kata not to carry hate in her heart, so I said bye and hugged Cece before we left...because you know what, what's done is done and I didn't have any hate towards her.  Oh and Laura hugged us and said hello...that was new.  I am glad though.  She is a good person and has to have a big heart to put up with my sister.  haha  Anyway, on Sunday we were supposed to have Kathleen's surprise birthday, but ended up just having a few friends over.  It was nice. I got to meet Ed's friend from when he was in Kuwait.  He was so nice and so was his wife.  I liked them.  They are the type of people you feel great knowing.  They were so nice and outwardly and genuinely so.  Then Uncle Mike came.  It is always nice to have him there.  He is such a special person in our family.  It would not be right if he wasn't here.  Then Ed's dad surprised us with a visit.  It was very nice to have him out here too.  Mary and Stuart came too.  That was fun, we played the DVD trivial pursuit.  That was fun adn Mary finally took Ed down.  HAHA  (We had to let Mary win, she might throw a fit...haha  Mary, if you are reading this, I was just kidding.)    My mom and I want to give Mary a bridal shower here...a fun one where she will get some fun stuff...how much fun stuff will a bunch of mormon ladies give her?  (okay that was an inside joke).  I think it would be fun too...and Mary is truly a part of our family, just like any of our close friends.  I a happy for her and wish her nothing but the best.  Stuart is also a nice guy and has been great to everyone in our family.  Monday was a day of relaxing and recovering for us.  We napped and napped.  LOL  My allergies have been acting up again.  Go figure.  I just hope to not have this problem forever.  I mean seriously, this is really driving me nuts.  I am looking forward to our trip up to the bay.  I am hoping to cross paths with some old friends.  That would be nice.  We will see what happens.  I am also amazed that Ed's brother Aaron will be graduating from high school.  Where did the time go?  I remember when he was in kinder...lol  Aww...time goes by so quickly.  This time of his life is exactly when Ed and I renewed our love for each other. It was an exciting time for us.  I just hope that he and his love take things slowly and enjoy everything youth has to offer.   Don't get me wrong, I don't regret my life. I love it, but it isn't easy and well, take a lot of energy, patience and growing together.  But everything has turned out for the best.  School is a struggle and financially it is tough, but we have a lot more love and joy than any monetary problem or school headache can deter.  You guys have a great week.
