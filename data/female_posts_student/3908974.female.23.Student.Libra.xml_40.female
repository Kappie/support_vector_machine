This weekend was magic, so many worthy memories packed into 72 hours that I can't even begin to record them all.  I will say these 5 things:  1.   On Independence Day, on the veranda of a hotel in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, over a bottle of Crown and a pack of Camels, I realized that I found the right man after all.  We are nearly comic in how opposite we are, so much that sometimes I still have a laugh about it.  I don't know if we're going to be in it for the long haul or not, and I don't much care.  Right now, in this period of our lives, we are perfect for each other.    2.  We drank moonshine with a man known as "Billy Club" and got pierced.  Billy, bless his blunt and rowdy heart, was one of the coolest people I have ever had the opportunity to meet.  3.  In the heat, in the sun, on the road, flying past fields of cows and ghost towns and fast food restaurants, I was so happy and thankful I thought my heart would break.  4.  We made it home an entire day late.  Wild nights.  5.  It's good to be home.  So there.  If I had unlimited hours, I would record every minute.  But I don't really need to--It's commited to memory.  Life is going to change, come August, but I hope against hope that I can hold onto this feeling.
