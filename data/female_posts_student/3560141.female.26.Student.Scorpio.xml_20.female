I'm not sure if I can be held accountable for what crossed my mind at this point because it was sheer fear...but I had the likes of a ninja, with one eye steadfastedly gazing into the bee's six thousand eyes, and the other on the length of the cigarette in my mouth...all of a sudden it seemed like a Marlboro Ultralight 100, grew inches before my eyes...   But I refused to let this yellow jacket make a yellow belly out of me...so I continued with my cross eyed gaze..before i knew it...he (had to be a he...didn't have the likes of a queen) swooped into the apartment. I was conflicted, do I put this cig out run inside and warn the Armenian and Yeah man(new roomie), or do I save myself by staying outside on the patio forever? Before I could answer this moral dilemna for myself, God, Murphy, fate brought the answer into the picture for me with the arrival of yet another yellow jacket onto the patio bannister....Fuck...in a city with so much concrete, and not a colorful blossom in sight, we seemed to look like a hive...Fuck   I put it out...the bastards had won...I slid in through the barely ajarred patio door, and then I heard it, the bzzzz the bastard was taunting me...He was just between the glass and the curtain, I trapped him there, shutting the curtains firmly from an arm's length away....because you know the curtain is as effective as Raid...whatever...   "Armenian?" I said quite loudly, what would happen if I let a bee in? He's laughing incessantly and slowly shuttles the bee outside...turns to me and says ."Everyone's ok, no one's hurt, break it up, go home everybody." I'm lucky I got away with 3/4 of a smoke and no stinger in my ass...
