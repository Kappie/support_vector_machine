No, I know absolutely nothing about London or England, especially in 1983, but it wasn't meant to be taken so seriously.  It was just a few little stories to entertain the bored.   By the prickling of my thumbs Something wicked this way comes. A child, ninety-nine years young; So long lived, yet not begun.
