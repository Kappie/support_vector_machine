Wow, the math part was really really really easy, there were questions like "if x=2 and y=4 what is x+y?" well..maybe not  that  simple but pretty close. The verbal part..uh...well lets just say it would be helpful if I expanded my vocabulary. I am sleeping in tomorrow...I'm tired, and I could sleep now I guess...but then the morning would come to soon and I don't want it to be sunday.  Every sunday I have this lingering feeling that school is approaching the next day and for me...well that's never a good thought.  It's kind of sad.  Both of my best friends have lost their virginity and I still haven't had a first kiss.  Seems kind of silly and immature to be thinking of this, i feel like a dork, but what can I say my mind wanders.  Ever have to moments where you feel like you couldn't possibly be more of a dork even if you tried??  With dumb immature thoughts and you just wanna smack yourself? yeah...I feel like that sometimes...a lot of the time...most of the time.
