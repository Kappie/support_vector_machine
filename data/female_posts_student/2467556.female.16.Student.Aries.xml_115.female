Today, after exams, i went out with Jessi to what was supposed to be a movie, but then turned into lunch with Robbie and some of his friends at La Madeleine.  I got this half rotisserie chicken thing with a mini caesar salad.....except the chicken WAS SOOO BIG!!!  I did finish it all though, i'm such a beast.  Me and Jessi then went from lunch to my house to talk about guys and life, it was very exciting.  Alright so today i was reading this conversation that i saved between me and a guy friend because it was really hilariously funny and i just came to this realization after rereading it all.  There was this one part where he was asking me why i didn't like thongs etc etc (looong story, don't ask, its kinda an inside joke) and then i was like "so what is it for you, boxers or breifs?" and then he asked this question that looked like "would you like more?" (meaning thongs) but because of his poor spelling, it wasn't saying that at all!!!  He was asking "what would i like more [on him: boxers or breifs]?" and i misunderstood the question!!!!  i'm soooooo stupid!!!  so he probably thought it was weird for me replying "sure why not?" because that was not the right answer to the question!  grrr, i'm so dumb!!!  But i dunno, i guess it worked out, because even when i asked him to clear it up to see if i read the question right, he never corrected me or restated it, so maybe that was what he was trying to ask.  Because shortly after that question, he asked me what color do i have the most of (even though he knows that i don't own much of that style of underwear because i HATE it) and then we jokes around some more.  Why i chose to put this in my blog, i have no idea, maybe because i wanted to advertise my stupidity in that conversation.  i should be studying for french, but i don't really feel like it......i will later though, i promise...  or not.  gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
