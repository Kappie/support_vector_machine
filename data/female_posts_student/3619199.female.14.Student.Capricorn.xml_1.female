There is a logical explanation for my sudden outburst of song (even though listening to the go go's isn't logical, just plain suicidal). I recently got back from vacation in Florida. Me and my family went to panama city beach for a little "bonding time". I actually expected the worse (hey, I like bonding with my family as long as we don't have to do it together) It's like some guy once said "there's no such thing as fun for the whole family". But to be honest (which is hard for me), i had a surprisingly fun time. Oh gawd, i can't believe i just wrote that. Quick, everyone run for shelter, Armageddon is NEAR!!!! But to be serious (which, is also extremely difficult for me), the vacation wasn't that bad. I guess i thought it would be one of those things where my parents would try to "get to know me" or "understand my transition from child to teenager" ya know, the basic Dr. Phil crap.  i was wrong. My dad didn't spend countless hours hounding me about responsiblity and my mom didn't go into one of her long "womanhood" speeches(which i am very thankful for). We just spent most of the time at the beach (no crap) horsing around (ha, i said "horsing around" i never say that!, okay i officially lost my mind, come to think of it, i never had it *ponders for a second* maybe i should look into getting one, they're probably rare nowadays).  Well i'm going to take some time to look for a brain. There was a lot of other things that happened to me on the trip, and i saw some, dare i say "interesting" people too, but i'm to tired to talk about it now (hey, vampires need there beauty sleep too, and i need as much as i can get). so i'll tell ya'll more later. I know you guys are on the edge of your seats (maybe you guys should be looking for brains too).   ............ vacation all i ever wanted, vacation had to get away    DAMN THAT SONG!  chow for now
