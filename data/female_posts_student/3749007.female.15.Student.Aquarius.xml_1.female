Last night, I went to be around 2:30 or so..and then the phone rang at   6:30   this morning. Ughhh. And usually, after I'm awake, it's too hard for me to fall back asleep, so I'm stuck being the only one in my house that is awake. Well, Dad would be too, but he had to go do some work, and I don't know if Thomas is awake or not, considering he hasn't been here but maybe 3 or 4 days this summer, which would be completely fine with me, EXCEPT for the slight little problem that whenever I get in trouble for doing something, I have to blame it on the dog. Mom didn't seem to buy what I was saying when I told her that Jill bought a pair of Chuck Taylor's on eBay. Go figure... Yesterday was guite some day...First, me  Dweeb talked a while, actually, I think we talked all morning pretty much, although nothing was said. Isn't it funny how you can talk to someone for a few hours, and then you realize nothing has been said...   Well, then later that night, after a quick trip to Wal*Mart, I went  ate at the BV! Yum! Then, to the BlockBuster, to see if they have the Secret Window, but NO, they are ALL out...  So it's back to the house. Then I get mostly packed for Oklahoma...gonna be fun!! I get back on the comp, and start my talking with Dweeb again. Talked about nothing for a while. Then the weirdness/i-don't-know-what-else started...  I don't know. I mean, I'm not at liberty to tell you the happenings. I don't want to get anyone hurt, including myself. If you are a noteworthy person whom I think needs to know about last nights happenings, I will have my people call(or msg) your people.  I would tell you on here, but things could get intercepted  twisted, so it's better not to say on here. I'll tell you in person, seeing as how things are already twisted more than enough.  Well, I think that's about all I can say on here. I think I might possibly have one of the longest blogs. Maybe that will make up for the week that I won't be able to blog, because I'll be in Oklahoma.  Much Love
