Blackbird (John Lennon, Paul McCartney) Lead Vocal: Paul McCartney  Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these broken wings and learn to fly All your life You were only waiting for this moment to arise  Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these sunken eyes and learn to see All your life You were only waiting for this moment to be free  Blackbird fly Blackbird fly Into the light of the dark black night  Blackbird fly Blackbird fly Into the light of the dark black night  Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these broken wings and learn to fly All your life You were only waiting for this moment to arise You were only waiting for this moment to arise You were only waiting for this moment to arise
