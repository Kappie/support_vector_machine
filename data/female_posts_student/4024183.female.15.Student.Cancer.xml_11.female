Becuase of what him and Kandace are doing (you know, they're together, and the divorce isn't final) its like I'm in some cult that if I tell anybody that I'm in it, I'll be beheaded. Him and Kandace were brought up to me by a friend today, and then SHE goes and tells him that I'm the one that told her about them. She needs to get her shit straight, big time. He needs to realize that I am trust worthy. The only reason that I even put this on here is because of the fact that I need some place to release my anger without killing myself or some one else. Momma finally stood up for me today. It didn't help though, because Robbie's dumb ass fought back. I wish she would just kick him out, and let him get a taste of the real world. He thinks I'M not trust worthy! Me! I tell people that I don't know, and that live in another state simply because I know that they could really care less. I wish somebody would get me out of this hell hole.
