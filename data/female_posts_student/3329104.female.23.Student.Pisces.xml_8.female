Overall I did great this quarter.  I have only 2 classes left until I finish my A.A.  I am going to be taking Geology 100 at Eastern starting the 21st of June, which I need for my A.A. and B.A. and I am going to be taking my admission of the eduation program at Eastern 200.  That's going to be exciting.  I am also going to be taking Social Problems--well I am taking that now but the class doesn't end until mid-July.  Then in end of July I will be taking Math 212 which is Math for Elementary Teachers II and Intro to Economics.  It's going to be a long summer.  I wish I had more of a life.  I miss it.  My old life I mean.  I used to have such a great time partying and shopping.  I was supposed to get it out of my system by now but it hasn't really worked out as well as I wanted to.  I also got fat.  My self-esteem has some issues that it never had to deal with before.  I am going to go work on that one today at the gym.  I am REALLY going to work on my weight now that its summertime.  We'll see how long that lasts.   I have to study now.
