I stole it from troy and I think the idea is genius and everyone who ever thought about blogging should get one. So everyone sign up and that way we'll never have to visit blogs that haven't been updated and there will be world peace.   this week((and I'm sorry for not posting)) has been fairly exciting. That is, if you were watching me. Most of the highlights of the past seven days have included myself and something coming in contact with my head. So I'll start from the beginning.  Saturday((2-21-04)) was great. We went to the parade and had pizza and tacos for dinner and stayed at the Horse Shoe((hotel)). It was me, tiffany, Sarah, sarah's cousin who's in college and we invited at the last minute, Lauren, and 3 other people who don't count since they were Devon and her two friends. Towards the middle of the parade((not the 2 hours we hung out at the park waiting, the actual parade))((they were late getting started)) sarah's cousin's friend came and met us. His name is bo, and he's fabulous. He stayed in the hotel room until 5am debating the meaning of life with mom and I and explaining some of the more detailed aspects of quantum mechanics. He was quite fascinating, and we'll be having lunch with him some time soon. But of course, the other girls((not having a taste for quantum mechanics, I assume)) were bored to sleep by 2, leaving me to stay awake all night, get 3 hours sleep, and be a zombie the next day.   on Sunday, while intensely groggy, we went to the krewe of highland parade and had a pretty good time. The best part, however, was seeing Steven((mom's oh-so sophisticated bf)) dressed as a can of SPAM((riding on the "super heroes" float, no less)). Apparently his daughter has a "thing" for SPAM and he bought that costume at the SPAM museum on their SPAM-themed road trip to...... Montana??? Missouri??? Minnesota??? whatev. So of course, he was the funniest thing ever, and I have crowned him "the sexiest can of SPAM ever" which to me, is really fucked up. But anyways, after the parade we went to a BBQ at the neighbors and despite my exhaustion, I got a goddam second wind and stayed up til midnight cleaning my room.   Monday through Thursday were pretty much a big blur, as many of my weeks are. This week only being different because many of the days were literally blurry due to the serious head trauma I had received. On Wednesday I was playing volleyball((yes, it's another volleyball wound)), and that damn thing was spiked right into my head. When it first happened it didn't seem so bad, but I've now come to realize that my left ear isn't working very well, making this this one of the few injuries I've had that weren't hysterically funny afterwards.  oh and prior to the volleyball incident, I was sitting with my mom, who was crocked in her room. We were talking about daddy and I rested my chin on her knee. I must have said something that pissed her off because she jerked her knees and slammed my jaw in between them, hitting a couple glands and doing some damage. Once she did it I ran to the bathroom and cried. I think I was more upset over the fact that she wanted to hurt me than about her actually doing it, even if it did hurt.   later on in the week when mom and mammaw were fighting about bills I was upset so I ran to the bathroom and cried. Then I touched my jawline and was reminded and cried some more, then I touched the spot where Devon hit me and was reminded and cried some more. I was sad.   then on Thursday was when I got it big time. I was sitting in bed with my mom watching TV, it was around 9, so Devon was already settling down for sleep, but was still awake because mom and I couldn't quit singing the sugar booger song, which I will sing to you later.    goddamit goddamit goddamit goddamit goddamit AOL! I had a foot of blog entry that I hadn't saved yet and that motherfucking #^#%^-sucking AOL got a glitch and deleted it! OMG I could run right up to whoever wrote AOL and fucking kill them right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  so I guess I'll start rewriting my WHOLE ENTIRE POST NOW.  so I was sitting with my mom and then I poked Devon and she reared up and started clobbering me. At first I was laughing at her, since she was going at it so fiercely and not really hurting me that bad, until she threw herself back and punched me in the face. I was flabbergasted! Squarely between my eyes! That little motherfuck! So after a few minutes of howling/crying/hyperventalating/thinking my nose was broken and dabbing an almost undetectable amount of blood from my nostrils, I went back to my mom's room and acted like nothing had happened. Even replying to my mother's fuss with "oh please, like one clop in the head from THAT little bastard could affect me". But of course that shitass couldn't keep her mouth shut she had to give a fake, sickening "sorry, but ya pissed me off" with the same tone as one might say "sorry kid, but it was for your own good". Was excruciatingly mad. But luckily you can't see anything unless you look really close, and I'm sure I'll GET OVER IT like I always do.   on Friday night I went over to sarah's house and watched movies and ate and played pool and danced around. it was fun. I got home around midnight and slept good.  this morning I woke up and struck a sort of deal with mom that as long as I kept doing everybody's chores, she wouldn't bring Devon home((hmm.. Manual labor or seeing your sister??? Manual labor it is!)). So around 2 I had the house completely spotless and of course, mom lied and said she was going to the store but she actually came home with the bastard. So all my efforts to keep her gone were futile. I was taken advantage of, duped, screwed over, pissed off.  so I spent a good part of the afternoon being pissed off. I was so pissed off I mopped the floor. But then mom and mammaw started fighting and I forgot about my own little vendetta. After they yelled a while we cooked dinner and now "it's all good" so I'm not supposed to care.   will I always be expected to get the fuck over it?   so now I'm here, retyping my lost blog entry, and they still had the nerve.... After all I did... To make me do more chores and let deviance friend come over, leaving me on the couch tonight, and that smelly little girl in my bed. Which means I'll have to wash my sheets tomorrow.   after everything, it all boils down to the fact that I have sheets to wash.  oh, the sugar booger song. We heard this on bob and tom the other morning and thought it was really funny. I don't know all the words((and mammaw won't let me have kazaa)) so I'll sing everything I remember:  ((E5 power chord))((dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun)) I picked my nose I got a booger I put some sugar on it it was a sugar booger and then I ate it  hopefully I can fenaggle kazaa for a couple hours so I can make it my song of the day, because it was really funny.  here's something weird I thought of. If everything in nature occurs in threes, and everything outside of nature occurs in fives, then wouldn't that make multiples of fifteen important somehow?? Should I just quit thinking?? That was retarded...  NO RAIN All I can say is that my life is pretty plain I like watchin' the puddles gather rain And all I can do is just pour some tea for two and speak my point of view But it's not sane, It's not sane  I just want some one to say to me I'll always be there when you wake Ya know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today So stay with me and I'll have it made  And I don't understand why I sleep all day And I start to complain that there's no rain And all I can do is read a book to stay awake And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape escape...escape...escape... All I can say is that my life is pretty plain ya don't like my point of view ya think I'm insane Its not sane...it's not sane. -BLIND MELON-
