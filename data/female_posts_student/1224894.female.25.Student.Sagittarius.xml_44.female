I went there expecting to be bored out of my mind, and yet, excited to be there together with a different crowd.   Joining the Lectors’ Ministry might have been the best thing I did way back last year, but there were surely times that I regretted being one. It’s not because of the Ministry itself but with some of my co-lectors that are nothing but hypocrites and “orocan”…as in. I’m not saying I’m better than them, but, one thing I am not, is pretend that I’m religious…nor a devout Catholic.   As I prepared my things the night before our departure for Bohol, I was anxious to see my grand ‘rents again…and my cousins whom I rarely see, yet they make me feel welcome. I know that in Loon, I’ll be having a grand time with the family, but, what will I do in Tagbilaran where we were to have our “Holy Retreat”? Reflect? Recollect? Rest?   On my way to the assembly area, I was gripped with sudden attack of unrest…and always in a hurry. Maybe because I spent hours in Butuan when I should have been home relaxing and awaiting the hour of departure…instead, I was hard pressed with calls and text messages from the President, officers and members of the Ministry. Argh!! And when I went to get the streamer, the not-so-polite girl told me that I have to wait for another hour since it’s still wet…Argh! So, as not to get mad and stomp my feet in exasperation, I went to Keysa’s and in an impulse, I bought a Capri, and then went to E Music and Sports Shop to buy my guitar.   Got the guitar tucked safely in its case and before going to the terminal, I went back to the streamer and got it then went to the bus terminal for home…that’s about 11:15.  12:35 p.m. the Pres kept asking where I’m at since I have to be at the assembly area earlier than the suggested time…Waaaaah!!! Ang kulit nyo rin!!!   12:50 p.m. AT LAST!!! Got to the assembly area, arranged some of the paperwork needed for the trip, and met some members who just paid their dues at the last minute…  “kalami ba jud dili paubanon…”, but, it’s not my call, besides, it would be really fun to have them all in Bohol since most of them are first timers…  Well, at 1:45, the last batch of the Ministry headed for the pier with Msgr. Bienvenido A. Betaizar just in time for the ship to leave. Everyone’s having fun…including my Mom…and as usual, she had so many snacks with her even “tambis” she brought along with her…hmmm…  Anyway, I fell asleep on the ship and woke up just in time for the men asking me to have my guitar taken from its case and played. Songs were played and sung and almost everyone joined in. Pictures were taken and smiles were exchanged…  Well, here goes Bohol…pictures are going to be posted later…
