I TALKED TO MY MOM ON THE WAY HOME AND I CRIED AND CRIED AND CRIED TO HER. I FINALLY WENT BACK TO SLEEP AROUND 7:15 OR SO AND I WAS STILL FEELING SO BAD WHEN I WOKE UP. IF YOU WANNA TALK TO ME ABOUT WHY I WAS UPSET THAT'S FINE BUT I'M NOT GOING TO PUT IT UP HERE FOR THE WHOLE WORLD TO SEE. ANYWAYS, I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO FIESTA TEXAS WITH BRITTANY, MEGHAN, KEVIN AND JAMES BUT I KNEW THAT IF I WENT, I WOULD BE SUCH A DOWNER CAUSE I RANDOMLY STARTED CRYING AT DIFFERNET PARTS IN THE DAY...THEN MY MOM ASKED IF I WANTED TO GO TO THE LAKE WITH HER AND MY LITTLE BROTHER TO CLEAR MY HEAD A LITTLE BIT AND I SAID OKAY. KYLE WAS TOO CUTE AND BOUGHT ME A RED BULL CAUSE HE KNOWS I LOVE THEM. AH, I LOVE THAT KID. THEN ME AND MY MOM WENT TO ACADEMY TO BUY ME NEW TENNIS SHOES. THEN I WENT TO TANFASTIC THEN TO RACQUETBALL WITH KRISTIN. OVERALL, I GUESS IT WAS AN OKAY DAY. IT GOT BETTER TOWARDS THE END. WELL, I'M GONNA GO. BYEE! XOXO KATIE
