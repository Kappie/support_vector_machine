I went to the movies with my mom tonight to see  The Notebook  it was muy buen... but very sad at the same time... it brought back some memories for me... some good... and some not-so-good, but it was fun.  I've been thinking a lot about what I am going to do after I graduate... and I'm really just sort of down about it all.  I will go to USC or College of Charleston... most likely USC... and eventually come back to Easley.. or Greenville.. or somewhere in SC and start my quiet lil' life in a quiet lil neighborhood... My friends on the other hand.. my best friends who i dont think i could live without.. will be 1) Jess- may still be around here but may move to a somewhat larger somewhat more exciting state.  2) Chad- I will probably never see(what I've thought about the most) He will move to California or .. somewhere in a HUGE city and dance with the stars.  and 3) Nikol- will be floating on a cruize ship..(that her daddy owns) somewhere in the ocean....   I just cant think about all this.. I know we can stay in touch.. I'm just not sure how hard it will be for me to transistion from H.S to college... and I really dont want to invest all my feelings in a relationship that will eventually break my heart... but no one else seems to be worried about this.. I guess its just me... Drained...
