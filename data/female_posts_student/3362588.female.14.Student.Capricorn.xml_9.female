Not that I'm dying or anything. heh)  Yeah, going to camp tomorrow.  Alisha's going.  merrr.  Her parents are going to just to make sure that she'll be 'comfortable'.  I can answer that one right now.  No.  She will not be comfortable.  She will probably have few if any comfortable moments at camp.  She will be dirty, thirsty, often hungry, probably scared, and sometimes lonely.  But what does comfort have to do with camp???  Nothing!!  Camp and comfort are two entirely unrelated ideas that have nothing to do with eachther.  But will she have fun?  duh.  That's why you go to camp.  I told that to mom and she smiled and told me not to say then when I was around them. haha.  Clarisa said that if Alisha gets there and she decids she doesn't want to stay, her parents will take her home.  Can you believe that?????  Gee, if she was my kid, I'd be like, "Goodbye!  And get used to it."  haha.  Lovergirl.... heehee.    So yeah..............  Camp's gonna be fun.  Then I get to go to another camp, which will be ausome.    Clarisa likes baggy shirts.  Okay, that was random.  Now she says I'm mean.  Tee hee.  Word.  Must go.  Signing off-   Jack the water goddess haha
