I know you should never post a work in progress, but I think I'll just fuck that cuz no one ever reads this anyways. Hee hee! OK, so here it is...  Symptoms of Total Collapse (Another totally irrelevent name)  I've been wasting my days on failed attempts at poetry been wasting my days on you I've been wasting my nights on ten hours sleep been wasting my nights on you  You've distorted the archives of my life quite enough I'd like to forget  I'm sure you're sorry so how about you say it You know I'm hurting But what are you gonna do about it? Just forget? (let ME forget)  Slip into the sheets of frozen rain awaiting you beyond this door go on, let the ice penetrate your skin and pierce your heart the same way that apologetic look pierced mine  Yeah, I know it's not me it's you why did you have to say what we both already know skip the cliches and move on to the truth  "Let's just be friends." After you've killed me with your words and your apologetic look?  I'm sure you're sorry so how about you say it? you know I'm hurting  But what are you gonna do about it? Just forget? (Let ME forget)  I love this city we live in I can hide among high rise buildings write your name on their walls  I'm sure you're sorry so how about you say it? You know I'm hurting But what are you gonna do agout it? Just forget?! (Let ME forget!!!!)  I hope I've torn you apart with song I'll write in my book of tangents once more and then I'll forget.
