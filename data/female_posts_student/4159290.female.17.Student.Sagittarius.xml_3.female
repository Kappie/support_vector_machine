I had talked to David for 76 minutes (I looked at the timer before I hung up) and I was listening to my Hilary Duff CD, which is very good happy music, and I was chatting with Robyn and Will and Pete, so everything was all cool.  Then I was reading Robyn's and Zach's blogs, and they were talking about school starting, and I started missing everybody.  I'm still not too happy about living in Florida,  if you didn't already know that.  I mean, I get to hang out with Chelsea and family a lot, and I have a really awesome school, and, of course David's there.. (altho I haven't gotten to enjoy that yet, lol)  But, still..  I absolutely *hate* that I'm not going to high school with y'all (I'm not bothering to clarify who y'all is.. you guys know.)  It just doesn't feel right.  Ever since we all started hanging out in 6th grade, I was looking forward to growing up together, and prom, and dates, and hanging out, and all that crazy teenage stuff.  (This includes Rachel too.. cuz she coulda at least driven down to hang out with us)  Grr..  stupid father's midlife crisis...  Oh well.  I don't mean to be giving this big huge sob story.  Just wanna make sure you guys know that I love and miss you all terribly..  *sniffle..*  Seriously, you guys are really, really awesome..  I'm really glad I have friends like you, even if I hardly ever get to see you.
