Download the huge demo from  urlLink Spiderweb Software . Oh how I love that game. I'm pretty slammin' at it too. Heh.  I've been logging my driving hours because you need a certain number to get your license or something and I totaled 4 hours and 75 minutes. Long way to go. I drove in town for the first time yesterday. Up until then I have just been on the back country roads that nobody goes on. Honestly, city kids, I don't know how/where you learn to drive. You brave kids, you. It wasn't bad because I was going by the school and the residential area so the speed limit didn't go above 35 MPH which is what I've been driving mostly. My dad doesn't like me going faster than that and sometimes I don't but on straight-stretches sometimes I find myself going faster than I think I am. Something like that.  I think I'm going to go see King Author today with Sarah. She likes the chick from Pirates of the Carribean and all that Medeival (sp?) stuff, which I also think is cool (the Medieval stuff, not the chick - she annoys me because she's so gorgeous when she was just 17. I mean, it's just wrong for someone to have so much luck and some of us don't get any.). I like seeing movies. In the summer I get frustrated because normally I'll wear a hoodie or jacket and take in drinks and candy and stuff so I don't have to pay those outrageous prices at the cinema. But in the summer it's way too hot and wierd to wear a hoodie.   Weird or wierd? I've never known.  I wish I could sleep in. I can't wake up after 7. It's very frustrating.  Shelby's Birthday is coming up. I can't believe she's going to be 17. I don't have very much money to get her a gift...I hate buying gifts...I'm too insecure to think anything I'd get is good enough. You know what I mean? I have something for her already but I think I should get her something else with it because she is a good friend and all and my gift cost me like nothing. However much CD-Rs cost. Can you guess what it is?  I haven't been doing anything this summer. Oh yeah. We're All Broken is signed up for a couple Warped Tour shows, including the one I'm going to. So I get to see them, but I was right when I guessed they'd play sometime this summer at Alley Katz in Richmond, they are on the 18th of August. I'm a little disappointed that they will be playing the Warped Tour. I have troubles with being too much of an elitest for alot of things. I wanted to go see them in Richmond where there would be like nobody there...you know...like just indie kids into music nobody's heard of. Pompous indie elitests, which I can be sometimes. But it's not hard to be around here where nobody's even heard of the Misfits for heaven's sake. Of course I'm going to feel a little superior, you know? What was I saying? Warped Tour, yeah, now everyone's going to see them. What if they get... mainstream . I shudder to think...  I do feel bad because lots of indie and punk rocker kids make it out to seem like they don't want their bands to be successful, like myself. I know that's wrong. I can't help it.  Oh I did get way off subject. I was saying I haven't done much this summer. It feels like school is really close to starting. Sometimes I'm real excited for it to start, wanting to get it over and done with, I hate being on the edge of waiting for it - knowing there's no way of getting out of it - might as well just start now and all that, you know? But other times I want it to stay as far off as possible. I want to see when the half-way mark of summer break is. I'll count later.
