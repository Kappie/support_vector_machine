I am particularly frustrated with what he did in Latin America during the Cold War; even though he apologized regarding the Contra mess, it still doesn't change the fact that he did more to disrupt the democratic process in Latin America than promote it.  Everybody is pretty familiar with the Iran-contra scandal, but not many people know about Reagan's other dealings with Latin America; he was a huge supporter of the dictator Pinochet in Chile, the dictatorial military of Argentina, as well as the one in Guatemala.  What we did we claimed we were doing as a lesser of two evils, but Latin American nations are still feeling the sting of our policy many years later--though democracy is slowly gaining a foothold.  We basically shook the hands of very right-wing Latin American dictators, trained their militaries, and provided them arms to hunt down revolutionaries.  The problem?  Those trained military officials that we were helping decided to just kill everybody in the process--not just those espousing communist or socialist ideals.  In order to "stamp out" communism, these military dictators that we trained and quite often put in charge would not just kill the revolutionaries, but the friend of the friend of the cousin of the friend of the revolutionaries.  As a result,  hundreds of thousands  of people went "missing" or were out-right executed.  Did you know that the military dictatorship Reagan helped put in place in Guatemala to deal with the revolutionaries ended up killing 800,000 people?  There are mothers still looking for their children, both in Argentina and Chile.  So...moral of the story is--yes, we did win the Cold War, but at a very hefty price.  I believe that the main difference between how we're handling Iraq and how we handled Latin America is that we are working very closely with the Iraqi people in helping them to eradicate terror.  We are  not  installing dictators to kill the terrorists, which is exactly what we did in Latin America during the Cold War.  We wonder now why democracy isn't spreading as quickly as we had hoped in Central America.  Why?  Because often times we would over-throw the democratically elected leaders there, who just happened to have some socialist ideals.  It got to the point where Latin Americans just wrung their hands and said, "What the hell do you want from us, exactly?  You want us to be democratic and anti-communist, but in order to do that you are subverting the democratic process by training anti-communist dictators.  What gives?"  So, to sum up.  I am very sorry for the Reagan family loss, but I am also thankful that former President Reagan isn't suffering anymore, as he had a most terrible disease that I wouldn't wish on my worst Latin American enemy.  I think that his heart was in the right place during the Cold War, and he wanted what was best for the United States.  But, as is almost always the case, what is best for the United States comes at the cost of many other innocent (and not so innocent) lives.
