I know that there are words that should embody what I feel but whether or not I can put them here in this forum, let alone say them out loud to an empty room. I feel like alot of everything. I feel everything that goes on around me but I don't know how to act on them or live them. There are things in my life which I feel I need to be loved. I sometimes feel like I need the love of others to make me feel valid which is completely untrue. I also feel like I need a guy to make me feel beautiful or wanted.   Love
