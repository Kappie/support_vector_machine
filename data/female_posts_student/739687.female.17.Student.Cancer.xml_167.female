Here's story number one:  Get to the DPS in Hurst, and they tell us that my TEA form is expired by  TWO DAYS!  Oh my gosh. So much anger. Well, we got the TEA form on December 20th. So, my mom and I, being...desperate, change the 0 to a 6. Haha...yeah. We were angry. So we go to the other DPS, and they tell us that we have to go to the one in Hurst to get my permit. GAY. So, our plaigarism didn't work, but we were kinda glad, because we were so nervous about it anyways. We're getting a new TEA form now, and I won't get my permit until next Tuesday. *Boo*  Yeah, and I missed sectionals, Mr. Babcock says that the fact that my mom could only get off work today to go to the DPS isn't a "valid excuse", but whatever. I don't see how that isn't a "valid excuse." What a jerk. Okay, sorry, life not  revolving  around damn sectionals! So yeah, I'm gonna be screwed over tomorrow.   And also, I like how Babcock had such a  vivid memory  of listening to Jared play his chair test on Friday. He told me yesterday when I asked about it. So I asked Jared about it today...Jared was  never  at school on Friday. Very puzzling. I mean...think about it. He has a grade for Jared, and also specifically remembers him playing. Something is wrong with that. Something is also wrong with the fact that he didn't have grades for me or Kelvin, though we both played, so he thinks...writes a little bit, and then gives everyone their chairs. Honestly, he's making himself very suspicious. See, what would  appear  to be going on, is that he's  manipulating people's grades!  You know, maybe I'm being paranoid...but look at the facts. Sure, I definately do not agree with that man on alot of levels, and that would give me reason to be paranoid, so maybe it is just me. Except that other people see it as well. Makes you think.  Ooh, started reading  Atlas Shrugged  by Ayn Rand last night. It gets you hooked. Quickly.  Well, that's my day from hell. What a blast. Have a better day than me, crazies.
