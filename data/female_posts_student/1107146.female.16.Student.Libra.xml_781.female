I'm having problems with the box...the one I want is no longer about, and I'm really screwed. So we'll really have to see if that comes to be. Grr. But then I remember: a few weeks left. So it's all good. And my mom talked to the Eegee's people today, I think, so that's out of the way. All that's left is the dinner, the "after phase A", and the...um...parents. Eek, save me someone.   A pleasant nod of the head to all of you.
