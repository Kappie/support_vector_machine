(i think i just answered that in my summary above...so i dunno if i was just stupid back then or what.) the whole night that i stayed up writing my paper i couldn't stop cursing the stupid starving freakazoid, and i hated kafka for writing a story that i just didn't get.   i think part of the problem was that the professor wanted us to come up with our own prompt. it's a lot tougher than it seems, not having a question to answer; it's what i'd imagine being lost at sea without a compass feels like, or trying to find a needle in a haystack, but not knowing what a needle is or looks like or how it's different from a piece of hay. it wasn't until this exercise that i realized the questions that we're given usually contain the keys to the answers. anyway, ever since then, i vowed never to read kafka again, or anything remotely existentialist in nature. but now i gotta break my vow to myself that i almost forgot about, and what's more, it's for work that i'm getting before school's even started.  i'm on page 23 of the book. it's been a long four days.
