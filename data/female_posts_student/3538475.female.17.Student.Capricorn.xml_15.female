I feel good about this :D  I am getting frustrated by the secret ingredients game on www.Shrek2.com , the game is made for five year olds and, alas, a seventeen year old of such high intelect, cannot figure it out...ah maybe that's because I do not have intelect.  As prooven by my revision for biology, I see a big fat U coming my way!! WOOHOO!!  More re-sits = More fun ..... and pigs fly.  Another highlight to the day, other than having quality time, was getting a kfc twister, yes, you're right I lead a dull and boring life, you're amost asleep reading about it, well try living it!!  That is not the case for much longer, I hope.  Last night I renewed friendships with 'the girl down the road'  her amusing and sexually frustrated parents, this renewal was of course aided by alcohol and nibbles and a good old chat about the finer points of life, I promote un-planned get-togethers like this, they always turn out to be better then expected.  Well now, I guess I should get on with that revision, but not after some cancery goodness of the cigarrette kind.  Toodle pip young-uns'!
