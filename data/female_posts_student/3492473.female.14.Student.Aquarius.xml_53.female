I got up at 8 am to get ready and go to my Grandpa's with my mom, Eddie, his friend, (their painting my grandpa's house) and my dogs. So as we were leaving I was going to get into my brother's car and I ran into the corner end and cut open my leg. It hurt  really  bad! Today just a   blonde   day for me. Pretty much everything I said and did was blonde. Once we got to my grandpa's, we stayed hung out with him and made him breakfast. Then Eddie and Kevin went to get McDonald's for all of us. I'm kinda disappointed in myself because I know I shouldn't be eating fast food. Last Saturday I had fast food and then today. That's too much for me. But I got chicken nuggets and fries so they aren't that bad rite? After they came back from Mickey D's, my mom and I went to Richmond Mall. My grandpa lives right next to it. So we went into JC Penny's (it was the entrance) and my mom bought two purses she liked. I was glad to see her getting herself something because she is always so busy with the rest of the family that she puts herself last a lot. So then I went to the Juniors department and was looking at shirts. I found this yellow one I really liked but my mom didn't like it so I didn't get it. That was the only shirt I really liked there. Next, I was looking at jeans. I always have such big problems finding jeans so I was scared I'd end up crying. I tried on like 20 pairs...I could only get three all the way on. And I ended up getting two of them. One are regular jeans.    My mom told me they make my butt look really cute so I'm super excited for them!    They are really cute, they have neon pink and neon green trim...aww!    jeans...you hate to love 'em but you love to hate 'em!   Then I got sweatpants which are really comfy. They are black with white stripes. After that I went to Old Navy. They had a bunch of comfy clothes but I ended up getting: two skirts, (one is all black camo and the other is like fringy jean) a pair of tan cord shorts, two tank tops, (a white and a black one) and a white t-shirt. Sorry, I just felt like sharing. Then I came home and went to Tina's a little to see Bella, her birdy. Well, I'm gonna go, more later! muah~
