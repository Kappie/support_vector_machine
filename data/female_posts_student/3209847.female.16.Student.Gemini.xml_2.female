I got it taken away like 4 weeks ago? Well, I just missed it! It's such a part of me! I don't know, finally Sarah can call me again, without having to talk to my parental figures, what a saving grace! I am so thoroughly excited! This day could not be better.. well maybe.. if i had some fudge or some cookies or be out all night, you know, those unattainable things! anyways, enough ranting about chocolate and parties, i'll be gone! Have a great night everyone *kiss* to Sarah, and I will post sometime tomorrow! bye-bye
