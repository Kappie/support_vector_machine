HAPPY!  oooooooh i just remembered something too. i used to go up to the computer operated characters on stage, and look under thier skirts or in thier pants.  yep.   hooray! you know, i still have a coupon for free ten coupons, not to mention the very cool blue dog cup that entitles me to a lifetime's worth of free refills of soda there.  oh yeah. it's on.
