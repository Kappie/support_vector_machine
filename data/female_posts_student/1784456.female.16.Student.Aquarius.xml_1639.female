Maybe they've realised that I'm not a man that needs to take viagra! *for gods sake, don't go on this if you search for viagra!* Anyway... onto things that won't get me tagged by the CIA search engine... Crap, probably already am for including CIA in this. Good luck with your operation! Hopefully the surgeons won't have hang overs! *eh?* Naaah, I'm sure it'll go fine! Well, I hope it will! I've gotta go revise for my spanish speaking test tomorrow! *don't worry laura, we'll both be suffering*
