And I have no idea who it was who said that. I'm scared. I have stalkers at my blog. j/k.   Let's see... what did I do today.... I gave Brian a swollen lip while playing waterpolo.... then I jumped off the diving board alot and practiced my JackKnife dive.... And made fun of Steven... I love Steven... Fun Stuff. I got a Thousand Foot Krutch cd from Chelsea... And then I made Brian listen to real music, so he tells me he hates punk.... looser.... And then I sat on the concrete and got a really nice tan and talked to Hilary.... And she showed me where the bathroom is... yeah.  *sigh* I want Mandy to get on. I'm gonna tell her I made out with Brian today and see if she believes me. That is my idea of humor. Just ask Joe about the time I told himI was dying of cancer. That would be pretty sick though... Like really grossly discusting.... ewww... it would be pretty halarious if Mandy believed me though.......   Okay, here's the new rule if you want to post comments on my site, if your gonna be cynical, snide, or rude, leave your name so I can yell at you later. haha.   Signing off - Jack the really discustingly funny chick
