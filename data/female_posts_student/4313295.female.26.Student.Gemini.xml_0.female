NOTHING that I do really has a "reason"~ with the exception of my daughter... Her reason was to straighten me out. But, I mean.... seriously, let's stop trying to explain stuff.... Let's right this instant stop looking for these elusive "reasons" and start making our own. Be honest, are we truly ever going to find what we're looking for?? Does anyone even KNOW what they're really looking for?!?! WHO'S WITH ME?!?!? Let's start being proactive and aggressive and let's just take charge of our destinies a bit. If there's something you don't like, then CHANGE IT!! I know I sound all Television guru-ish, but seriously... I hear so much whining all the time from EVERYONE I know. I just want to slap them and say, "Look... do something for yourself!! Don't trust that some all-seeing power is just going to make things go poof for you." Because, really, does anyone really know?!?!     Seriously, though, if anyone knows Morphius could they tell him that I am in need of one of those pills?!?! :)
