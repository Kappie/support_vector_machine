Yes..Nick your right they are really stupid lyrics, cause she talks about getting tan and fishing but I still Love it!! Except you did kinda ruin it, I can't listen to the fish part without laughing my ass off.  God I'm never home anymore, ever! My life now consists of watching re-run after re-run of Dora the Explorer and Thomas the Train. Being woke up early to watch little Energizer Bunnys as I like to call them. Feeding them, changing them, keeping them entertained...it's all just part of the new "what-seems-like everyday" agenda. I don't know how much longer I can take it but I do know that I definitly do need the money. But a job at the mall would for sure be much more fitting haha!  So the whole "new sister" thing is working out really well. It's like having a whole bunch of new cool stuff and a new friend. She kicks major ass. We decided we'd share all our clothes and shoes and purses and hair stuff and...yeah well like everything. She's so much fun, we went shopping the other day too, great sister bonding haha. As hard as I really thought this was going to be it's not. It's one of the coolest thing thats ever happened. The whole sharing thing came out good. I thought I was going to be super annoyed  but I'm not so far so that's awesome. i probally sound stupid..oh well whatever.   I don't know how well the whole blog thing is going, I can't ever think of anything to write and I never feel like it.  Ok well I'm out...LaTeR
