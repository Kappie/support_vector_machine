Honestly speaking, the forum is rather addictive, I love to hear the voices of people from all over.   Just a random thought, I feel really blessed to be borned with such loving parents and siblings. I remember how I used to dislike my eldest sister, Mika, because in my eyes, it seemed as though she enjoyed only nagging and scolding me for every little mistake I used to make. When I was at my lowest (in Secondary 2), she reprimanded the s*** out of me to wake me up from my 'dreams' so as to face reality. It was a rather dramatic period for the both of us because I was so mad at her I swear I wanted to stab her with a knife each time I saw her. We hurled vulgarities at one another and she made nasty remarks which made me break down every now and then. However, after several weeks, I stepped out of that dark little corner of my bedroom and turned over a new leaf. I am using the phrase "turn over a new leaf" because I was once, what you'd never expect out of Pearlyn. I have to thank my sister for being so mean to me then. And I am truly sorry for being such an awful younger sister during that period. We're now on very good terms and I love her to pieces! Now whenever she nags at me, I feel so lucky because not everyone has older siblings to be nagged at. I anticipate the weekends these days cos she would return home from the hostel for dinner with her boyfriend. Well... So much about the side of Pearlyn not many people know :)   Congratulations to all CTNPCC cadets who have received their new ranks and badges! For those who were unable to achieve what they've been working for, good luck for your period of probation. Nothing is impossible if you work hard for it. I'll leave you guys with a quote by Richard Bach - " Every problem has a gift for you in its hands. "  Good night folks :)
