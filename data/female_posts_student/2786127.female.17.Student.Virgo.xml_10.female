No one cares about winning or playing well anymore and its pissing the hell out of me because not only is it embarrasing to be on a fucking stupid team, but its just pissing me off because i'm a competitive person by nature and when people don't care about winning as much as i do i get frustrated.   MRAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! WE lost every single game this weekend. I told my dad I was quitting because my team was shit and he told me I couldn't because im the captain and I couldn't let the girls down like that. To hell i couldnt, they wouldnt even care.  I need a tan before prom.  I want to go dress shopping.   I have to go to volleyball. Piss.
