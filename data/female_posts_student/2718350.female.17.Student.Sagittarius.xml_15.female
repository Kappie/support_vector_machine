Land mines blow up. people near land mines blow up. If someone had told me about 6 months ago that i would care so much i wouldnt beleive it, but considering that as of late I have actually been talking to him and that side of my Family finding out things that i had never known. Learning things that make me want to move to Oklahoma to live with my STEPmother as oppossed to my REAL mother, thats pretty sad i think. so yea anyhow I have been collecting applications to actual resturants near my house because i need a new/second job. partially because i am getting tired of the one i have and partially because i need at least 6 months in a tablecloth restuarant before goin to CIA. yea yea so im kinda bored right now and really i have nothing of any use to say right now so imana leave peace yo
