(frankly, i don't know the difference.. i think some people go to college then university.. is it?) do you ever think, what's to become of you? will you be able to cope with the college/ university work? Or will you fail horribly and get stuck with some idiotic 9-to-5 job..  i think i wanna study Psychology or Marketing, not very sure.. originally was marketing, coz.. i dunno why... then i just suddenly got interseted in Psychology.. now i'm thinking more about Psychology.. not sure which field of Psychology yet, but i think Behavioural Psychology would be interesting.. learn what makes people act the way they do..   as for people who are already in college/ in university/ working.. (though i don't think there are any..) Good Luck!
