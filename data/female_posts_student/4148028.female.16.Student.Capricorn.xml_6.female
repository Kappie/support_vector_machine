I do ask that you remain seated,and keep your horsebacks and coffee-tables in their upright and locked position until exiting this page. Thank you for your cooperation (please feel free to be a non-conformist and ride your horse backwards. I won't yell at you unless you start smoking). This shall be the end of my first bloggy thingy and there shall be more random spiffy-ness to come thanx!
