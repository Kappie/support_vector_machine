The  urlLink wedding  is tomorrow and we still have a lot of loose ends to tie up.  After that, we head to Vegas and LA and won't be back until August 22nd. Just in time to start school the next day. Bah.  Don't worry if you didn't get an invite, we'll  urlLink accept your gift anyway . We're good like that.  Okay, well I'm out for now. If I don't get a chance to update this tomorrow, talk to you on the 22nd!
