It's kind of chilly, but I'd rather it be this way than humid like it has been recently. I just wish it would rain...        When I went to California for spring break, I bought a pair of sky blue shoelaces with little yellow ducks on them for four dollars at the San Diego Zoo. Today I tried to sell them to my brother for sixteen dollars. No, that's not accurate; he tried to  buy  them from me for that price. Yes, my twelve-year-old brother wanted ducky shoelaces. And he would've gotten them, too, if he hadn't gone and mentioned the deal to my dad, who wouldn't allow his son to waste his money like that. Really, I think if my brother wants to blow sixteen bucks on something worth a quarter of that amount, that's his prerogative. I had nothing to do with the price; in fact, he  raised  it from twelve to sixteen dollars for no apparent reason. See, my brother's the type who pays ninety dollars for a get-out-of-jail-free-card when we play Monopoly... But no. My dad wouldn't allow it. Oh well. I kind of wanted those shoelaces.        I finished  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn  on Thursday. It was okay, I suppose. I didn't like it at the beginning, but it got better toward the end. After that I read  Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim  by David Sedaris, which was hilarious. I finished that last night, and today I started  The Catcher in the Rye  by J.D. Salinger, which is good so far.        Heh, speaking of David Sedaris, here's an amusing little exchange between VW and my father:        VW: Oh, I'm in love with David Sedaris...    Dad: You know he's gay, right?    VW: Yes... (sighs, looks disappointed)    Dad: Have you ever seen his sister Amy Sedaris?    VW: No, I don't think so.    Dad: Oh, she's really funny.    VW: Is she gay too?    Dad: No, I think she's straight.    VW: DAMN! I just can't win!        Heh, VW seemsawfully desperate to be a part of the Sedaris family...        Hm. I'm darn sure I had something to say, but it escapes me. Meh. Basically, my summer is what the typical person would call "boring", but it suits me just fine. And life goes on.
