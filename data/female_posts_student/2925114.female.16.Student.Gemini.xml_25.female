I find it absolutley amazing that she writes in my blog more than me...and her entries are far more interesting than mine are HAH! she's the definition of "blog member". lol WOO HOO. Thank You Emily. lol What are you all doing on the 31st day of the 7th month? GOING TO ANGUS'S PARTY?! yah that's what I thought you were doing...hrrm well you know what all of you should do? go to http://bonarlaw.blogspot.com/ you don't have to, but if you're a partier, like myself.. i HIGHLY suggest it. July 31st.. It's only going to be the best party of the summer...maybe even the whole year! And come on! If the party was actually named something, you know it's going to be good! yah! for the Bonarlaw Party..so don't worry if you don't go...we won't miss you...muahaha jk do it!!! you must be the 243rd person! You have to be! There's just no other number to be. I wasn't exactly invited myself, but I'm friends with Angus, he went on Adrienne and I's Good Will Store underwear shopping adventure, oh and we visited Aren't We Naughty with him...and got kicked out without him. It's good he knows how crazy I really am now...oh and there's the whole I'm Chris's girlfriend thing, that may have had a little something to do with it...okay maybe alot but hey! GO TO IT! YOU HAVE TO! If I'm going... anyone can go! That's it I will persuade you no more....Thank you again Emily for regularily posting on my blog, it makes it look like it's actually used occasionaly..I will try to write more, because I know how much everyone wants to hear what i have to say...pssh. Anywho BONARLAW...JULY 31st! BE THERE OR BE...you chose....
