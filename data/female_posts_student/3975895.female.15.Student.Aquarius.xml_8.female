Gotta start learning to put others in front of myself..to think 'bout Jesus furst, then others, then myself. Retreat was awesometho, even tho i was tired most of the time..cuz of sleeping late, i still had tons of fun! But things weren't so great aside from those good things...i'm starting to get skared..starting to feel disappointed...starting to not believe what i should believe. Speechless. But i'm also happy, cuz Alan's my gor again, and it feels just like how it used to be! me very happy 'bout that! Me so tired..went to Abby's house for bbq..and she drove us to TCBY..soo fattening, but i ate some.and threw out the rest..but yeah..played cards after..reallee phunniee!!!! But now i'm home and tired. So i guess i'll head off to bed now!
