Me and Brittany are going to see it!!!!  aw, man just think of the plethora of hot guys and hockey teams that are going to be there!!!!  eeeeee i'm so excited!!!!  I hope we're the only girls in the theatre, that way there's no competition lol.  not that i'd really hook up with any of them or anything......but if there was any boring parts in the movie (which i'm sure there wouldn't be), there would be eye candy to pay attention to.  aaaaaaaahhhhh t-minus 1hr and 20 mins until me and britt go!!!!    Blonde kid with no fashion sense update (i swear this should be a column in a magazine): aaaaaahhhh the stupid jacket!!!!!  maybe i should set fire to it while he's looking the other way.  today was embarassing when i was inspecting him by myself (because Lauren was at Gold Renaissance) and he looked at me and gave me this look like "aha i know you're checking me out!" when i WASN'T!  i'm inspecting his clothing so i can tell Lauren and then we can write a report about it.  great.  now he's going to be "thinking i'm checking him out" everytime we're in the same lunch line together.  stupid blonde kid! i am not checking you out! i am telling other people about your poor color coordination so in effect they can fix their clothing problems!!!    Sports update: NHL All star break this weekend.  Watch the YoungStars game on Saturday to check out all the under 25 players and then watch the All Star game to....well....watch the all stars.  Coppell tied with Marcus 3-3.  Michael Ozowski sucks and i want T.J back.  We would've won, had TJ been in goal.  I don't like Ozowski, i don't like the way he plays and i certainly don't want him in my frickin' team's goal.  aaaaagh.  But you know what, its ok.  Because i found out that Jesuit LOST to Flower Mound 3-2!!!  What losers!!! haha.  anyways.....yeah.......only 2 more games until we get TJ back and we can have better wins.  thank god.  lalalalala anyways, i really have nothing to write because all i can think about is hockey because of the NHL All star break AND i'm going to see Miracle tonight!!!!!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
