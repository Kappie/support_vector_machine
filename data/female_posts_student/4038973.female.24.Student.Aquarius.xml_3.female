I would create the account, come to it after a few weeks, sometimes months (no no not years yet!..god hope not) and realize that i have forgotten my username and password. So well i would create a new account....and can you make a wild guess as to what might have happened again...hahaha...well i need not say it...yes exactly that! Well today I made sure I would put this page up and become an active user...no matter what...so I ask God to give me that strenght....hehehe! Nah just kidding...I am for real this time....I am going to become an active user....and post something on it! So everyone out there who is reading this please wish me luck! Thanks in advance ;)    Aighty then, just feel free to post any comments or nething you think is of interest....Chao for now!
