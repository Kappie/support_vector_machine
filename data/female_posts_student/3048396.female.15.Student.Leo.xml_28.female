It brought down the whole school...I admit it made me depressed n stuff but it totally changed my mind bout that. I don't know what I was thinking when I used to think of it. I now realize theres more to life...nothing can be so bad that I have to do that...but I'll admit physical pain does make the pain inside go away...but yeah. I know alot of people dont get that but it really is true. I've experienced that. So yeah this week has been really odd...people have been alot quieter at school n stuff...*sigh* its just been weird...But yeah I really have had a new outlook on life...it made me realize alot of things...So yeah I feel good about life now...I realize what a good life I have and how good I have it...So yeah. I guess I really don't have much more to say...so I'll write more later...  May 19,2004 Rod Rice   -Tara
