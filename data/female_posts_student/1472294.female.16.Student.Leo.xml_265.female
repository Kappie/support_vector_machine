M O N D A Y - Slack, slack and slack. Coz I was tyring to relax after my stressful day at my workplace. Sunday was a disaster! But... I went out with my friends to celebrate her early birthday! Did nothing much but walk around from Little India to Bugis to Suntec. I even lied to my parents that I did not go for the Food And Beverage Fair 2004, they would be so crushed! But I had lots of fun there, good food and free/cheap stuff. Conclusion? It was a tiring but very fun day. And full too.  T U E S D A Y  - I really need a day of breather, I even let my mother help me to return my library books.... *~* So never went out. Drool over SDs, again... And just basically mope around the house. Even my aunty wanted to invite me out to shop, but I rejected her...  W E D N E S D A Y - Same and exactly like Tuesday. Coz I was too lazy, ya, call me a pig. My father also began to be very anxious about my postings results. I wasn't. I was trying to explain to him that it would be relaeased at Sat. He said, check, check, no harm checking. Darn.  T H U R S D A Y - Went out with my friends again. This time to Jurong East for the LOTR Exhibit. The so-called ''Only Venue In Asia''... Well, having to pay $16 for the entry ticket was a heartache, but it was certainly an eye-opener. I didn't know that the crew behind the movie were so hard-working and precise. I began to admire Alan Lee's drawings and sketches. And they even have the 'Armour Corridor'' where all the armour costumes were so, whoa! It was like the soldiers were standing right in front of you, facing you with the strong, cold looks... The costumes were breatheless! Especially, Galadriel's dress, so stunning! And, and Legolas's costume, Arwen's and Aragon! Eeek! The digital effects and make-up sections were so cool and informative. I actually cannot believe that behind the orcs and scary guys, they are actually extras in that costumes. Whoa! Oops, shouldn't leak out too much of information. But no cameras were allowed, so not pics. The souviners section was a let- down though. All the prices of the rings were kinda steep and so, fake, well. Everybody who loves LOTR should go and visit to be blown away. Though, the air-con was a little cold and the exhibit was a little dark... :p  F R I D A Y - Went back to work... *Yawn*  S A T U R D A Y - Went to purchase my MSD Mary at Domuya a few hours ago. So happy! *\^o^/* Although I will be seeing her only after three weeks, but I AM SO ELATED! YES! And I was posted to a JC, science stream. Yeah. And my ex- cca got first in their competition. Ya! Congrats! Today is certainly a fulfilling day! Haha!  S U N D A Y - Although Sunday will be tomorrow, I betta I can tell you what is going to happen tomorrow. Work, work and work. And maybe going out to have dinner with my family later...  END.
