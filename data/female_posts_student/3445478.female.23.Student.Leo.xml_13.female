I picked up elidel, hydrocortizone, Aveeno soothing moistere cream, J baby shampoo ect...oh, and benadryl.  Poor Nick . He weighs close to 18 pounds now! He is such a big boy.  I start work on Saturday... THIS SATURDAY ! Shawn and Nick are going to have a great chance to bond Saturdays while I work. I had to go to the mall and get black pants for my uniform. Ick! Nick up...Got to go!
