Now I can buy my switchfoot tickets tonight before they sell out!! Last SF concert I made the mistake of not buying them until a month before the concert and they were all sold out so I had to go with this random guys youth group. Fun.  :)  My mom is getting all mad at me because she says i'm a slob. I don't see a thing wrong with not folding ones clothing!!! I mean really, what if I am out saving the world and I don't have enough time to fold 'em!!  I am off to the dentist..I will post more about about my "slobiness" when I get back!!  Laura
