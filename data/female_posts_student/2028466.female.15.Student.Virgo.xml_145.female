The last Triple Crown winner was Affirmed, (1978) and before that, Seattle Slew (1977) But both are dead now, so there is no Triple Crown winner at the moment. GO SMARTY! hehe...I think he'll win! Not only did he win the Preakness (the one he just won) by 12 lengths (thats A LOT, considering one length = 20 ft) well..enuf horse talk, i bet anyone who reads this has no idea what in heck i'm talking about...
