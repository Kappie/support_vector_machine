We got two 1's, which is the best rating, 1 for the stage performace, and another 1 for our sightreading, and if you dont know what that is, its where you get a random peace of music and u have to say each note like "do re mi" and stuff and its in different key sometimes! But my day was agony! I didnt know we werent supposed to wear sneakers and of course i did and so i had to call my mom but she wasnt home and so my vocal teacher gave me some shoes that were 2 sizes to small! They were 8 and a halfs, i wear 10! OMG my feet hurt SOOOOO BAD!!!!! Yeah well, today is Fat tuesday and i sure took advantage of that, i ate too much, like no other. For some reason right now I dont feel very happy, reasons i dont know. Maybe its because i havent taken my meds in awhile. I keep forgetting, yeah. Well not much else, im tired. Have a nice day.
