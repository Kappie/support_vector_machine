He ate all of those within an hour...*shakes head* So yeah. Got up early and went to church...Mom and I gave Howard a Garfield beanie baby so we both got hugs from him. *sigh* Im really gonna miss him when he leaves. :( Cassie came up and hugged me and wouldnt let go...she really loves me...she had to sit between "Aunt Donna and Terri" So yeah...she did pretty good until the end...when she got the giggles...then we ate the best chocolate browies...to die for! Very good. Then Mom and I cleaned the library...woo...*rolls eyes* This months pay check isnt gonna be to good...only 29 this month...dang. So after that came home and headed over to Spencer to see my Grandpa some more. Im getting to know that hospital pretty dang well. So we stayed there for awhile...Cody was there and we were giving him crap. Supposedly yesterday he wore sandles all day and got really funny burn lines on his feet...I just laughed...hes so stupid but ya gotta love him...Hes like the closest cousin to me...well...thats around here..so yeah..we have fun. I give him crap all the time...like we were talkin bout sevies...n stuff. Then he was squeaking the chair and pretending he was farting...*shakes head* Yeah. Then we went to Walmart and we got all the paint mixed that we need for my bedroom. Im so excited! I'll be so bright...I wont get depressed anymore! It'll be so much fun to paint...Tho I have to get my room all cleaned up before we can paint...so I have alot of work to do this week...cuz we start painting a week from tomorrow. So we came home and I just laid around for awhile...bored as ever. Started to clean a lil more in my room...Counted all of my flip flops...24 I tell you 24! Thats not counting Ross's or my dressier ones. I have 20 just laying there in the kitchen, no wonder my mom was getting annoyed saying there was to many. LoL And these are only flip flops...Im not even gonna start counting the regular shoes....the church shoes...all that stuff...It'd never end! Yeah. I was also happy cuz I figured out Ross's shoe size from his sandles...since he wouldnt tell me last night...hehehe. ;) Yeah...So we grilled for supper and then I went to the church and practiced the organ for a whole 45 minutes. Thats the longest I've practiced in a long time. My mom was amazed. So was I. Then came home and sorted some more stuff in my room. I can't even walk in there...I have about 5 boxes just layin there full of crap in the middle of my room...You have to jump to get anywhere...to get to my clothes. Yeah. Pretty sad...But soon it'll be all pretty and I'll be happy. Since this is my b-day present I probably wont get a dang thing on my b-day. Oh well...*shrug*...Well Im outta things to ramble bout...so I'll head out for now....
