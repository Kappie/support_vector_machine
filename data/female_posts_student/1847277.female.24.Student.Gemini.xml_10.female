My advisors are both crazy crazy busy lately, which is bad for me, because both are normally so on top of things and all about near immediate email returns and the like.  That's right.  It's all about me.  I want their attention.  Screw their familes and commitments and publications.  Righto.    Ok, I know.  That's dumb.  But once you're used to getting attention it's hard to get used to being relegated to low priority status.    Now I have two hours to read stuff by Roman Jakobsen (one of the creative geniuses of our time, apparently), and then it's butts and guts time!  Wooo!
