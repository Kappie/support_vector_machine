Hee hee!    Eft and Teflon, I hope you are having a great time, and I hope to see you soon.    My vacation is coming up soon!!! I can't wait! I miss planes :(    Well I'm gonna go watch a movie and then go to work.. yea... soon even better!!! (I just filled out all the paper-work today!!!! Next comes uniform fitting!!!!!!!!!!!!)    Gimme a call if ya wanna chat, otherwise I'll see ya later!    by the way, ** Movie review **      Cold Mountain  - it was a bit long, but interesting. I do think it was more of a chick flick even with the civil war involved. I'd give it a 3 an 1/2 * out of 5.     Butterfly Effect  - WAS AWESOME! I loved it, I don't really care much for Ashton, but the movie was great. You have to watch both endings, completely different!! 5*     Last samurai  - was actually pretty good, there were some parts that dragged, or seemed dum, but overall was watchable. I don't like Tom but he did ok (always acts the same in every movie).  T heyneeded more effect fighting, rather then anticipating the big fight.3 1/2*    That's all for now, Cya all later! Love ya! :)
