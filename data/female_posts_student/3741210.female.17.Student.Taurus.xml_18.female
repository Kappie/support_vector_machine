Steve has two pillows but neither one of them has a blanket. John's upstairs in my room on my fold-out couch. My mom is making our PB's (I wish my dad would just take me out to lunch) and I, sadly, have to go to work. Catie suggested I name all the states in alphabetical order, and Amit suggested some computer games thatI'm afraid to go on to because my boss might catch me. I stayed up too late last night, 1 in the morning and now I'm tired. It was entirely my fault, I didnt want to go to bed because of the aforesaid reason. I had a lot of weird dreams. I was reherasing for a play and I didnt getcast because I read off the card they gave me, I had a dream that Lizzy McGuire (as in Hilary Duff)wasnt getting up out of bed even though her tv dad was doing everything possible, like dragging her out to the lawn and blowing foghorns in her ears. A bunch of other random stuff I can't remember now too. Well the boys are starting to stir and my dad wants to get an early startat work (yippie). See you all later
