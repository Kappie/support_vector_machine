Now that I have given my initiating statement, I have nothing further to add.  Except for a simple word-problem-type-thingy, anyway.  Does anyone know the word for a piece of paper that's been written on and erased over and over again?  I know the word exists, because I read it a couple years ago, I just have no recollection as to what it was now.  Um...yeah. Thus the beginning of my very first blog entry.
