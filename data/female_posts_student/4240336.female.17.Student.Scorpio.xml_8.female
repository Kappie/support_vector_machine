I had to go food shopping, which wasn't that bad since I bought a lot of shit (never go food shopping when you're hungry =x), then my dad took me to CD World. I really should have driven myself....all well. I hate driving. Anyways - I got 2 cds. I got Rush - Vapor Trails and I got Symphony X - V. I like the Symphony X so far =) Then I came home and I ordered some shirts. I got a Symphony X one (it has the masks on it...it's from their official site) then I got an Opeth shirt, and 2 Iced Earth shirts =] I can't wait to get them. I spent almost 87$ on band T's =X That'll suck once the bill comes.       Now tomorrow I have to work. Yuck. I gotta wake up at 830AM for the next (and last) 4 days. I was gonna hang out with Sara tomorrow night after work, but I'm really not sure now. I may tell her we'll just hang out Thursday night since that would be my last day. If we hang out tomorrow, I wouldn't get to bed till  probably  1030/1045. I don't go to sleep right away. Usually I'm up for about an hour once I lay down in bed. So, if I go to bed at 1030, I'll hopefully fall asleep by 1130 and get 9 hrs of sleep. That's if I don't have a problem sleeping in the night :/ Blah. I hate sleep. And yet, every morning when I wake up I just think about going back to bed at the end of the day >P       Now I'm just rambling. So I'm gonna go.
