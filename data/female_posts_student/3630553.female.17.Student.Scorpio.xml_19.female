As another man on the back seat hums along, I was like ,  what the ****?!?! Aren't there any other stations with a taste in music?   ugh!   The song makes no sense at all!    Yuck!    If there are local singers and composers that I would wish to stab in the mouths, on my list would have to be those who sang and composed  Spagetti, Otso-otso, Sasakyan?, Jumbo Hotdog,  and other  I'd-rather-be-deaf-because-I-canâ€™t-stand-it  compositions. And I mean no offense to anyone who loves to patronize such genre of music. Sorry, but I just hate it. My ears get irritated with such crappy shits. I swear, they suck!   Everytime I hear the " Apear tayo, sumakit ulo ko....blah blah " on the radio, I go like " Bullshit! Cut the crap! " I mean, so what if  sumakit ulo mo at mag-appear kayo ? The song makes absolutely no sense and the lyrics just stink.  BIG TIME!  And no, I am not discriminating our local singers and composers. Some of them just happen to play non-sense. I find it pathetic that our music industry feeds the public with such IQ-degrading,  multiple-meaning  melodies, which, by the way, even make it to the top of the charts. And you wanna know what's worse? None of the meanings make sense! I find it completely - a  garbage .    Ugh!  I must say, such songs are better off without the lyrics. What do you think?
