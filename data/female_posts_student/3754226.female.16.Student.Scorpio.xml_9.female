Everything about you amazes me,  I love you and I want everyone to see,  I have a feeling that’s so true,  My heart and I belongs to you.   Seeing you sleeping in my arms tonight,  Sets my heart to dance in delight,  God blessed me with an angel like you,  To love  care for me that only you could do,   At your lips, I gently planted a gentle kiss,  Which sends my heart totally into a bliss,  I cherish you, my precious darling,  And together, we’ll awake in the morning.   I closed my eyes and I can still see,  A vision of my beloved baby,  Your charm, my dear is truly magnificent,  It is unexplainable like an enchantment.   Your lips is soft and willing,  Enough to make this wonderful feeling,  I love the way you look and stare,  You make my feelings kindle and flare.   So I drifted off to sleep thinking about nothing but you,  What tomorrow may bring, we have no clue,  We just held each other tight,  And it lasted throughout the night.   I do believe in things like forever,  And I know we’ll reach forever together,  I do need and love my precious honey,  I’m talking about no one but you baby...
