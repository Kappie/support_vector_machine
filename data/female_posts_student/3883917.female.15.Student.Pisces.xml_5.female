Anyway, enough with the nonsense (litterally)...lately  I've been walking the narrow path with a broken legs and a few injured friends.  Diana's switching schools, Sarah's having problems with Dan that he doesn't even know about yet, Bryan doesn't even know Dani exists on this earth...one of my best Christian friends is now dating a pothead. What has this world come to? *rolls eyes* Diana and I had a very deep conversation last night, about how she's switching schools and how people are starting to forget about her already...and  it sounded so damn familiar , and soon enough my feelings for Vernon and Charter eventually surfaced. I came to realize actually a while ago that my time was up in those places, but I still long for the same surroundings, the same people, even the same noises and feelings...I get chills just wondering how I ended up here, in this place. I know I would never go back for good; I've accepted the fact that I might be spending the rest of my life out of my comfort zone.  Who says I won't learn to like it and learn from it?  Haha, me of course. Just kidding, but I'm still having a hard time accepting what God handed to me. I know it isn't, but  it feels like it's too much for me.  I know God would never do that to me, it still feels like way too much on my part....eh, I'll eventually get over it. Nick's on the phone, we might hang out today, so I'll rite more later.
