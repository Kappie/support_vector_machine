We should argue about all the petty things we may say about each other and we should not make statements that may be taken the wrong way.  We should try to make it so that what we say doesn't offend everyone we know.  This is a place to express our feelings, but if it is any need of concern we should be able to talk to each other.  And I know I'm one to talk because you guys have been friends for as long as you can remember and I'm just the fifth wheel, but I'd really hate to see you four stop getting along over something that was written.  Anyway I won't stop writing my blog.  This has helped me though all my family, love, school, and friendship struggles.  Even though it seems as though I say nothing it has helped me to open up to people or a person at school.  Liz knows what I mean.  I plan to continue to write.  Well we got out of school early today.  Yeah!  Snow!  And I don't have to go to practice.  But now I don't know what to do for the rest of the day.  Oh well I'll find something.  Until later, BYE!
