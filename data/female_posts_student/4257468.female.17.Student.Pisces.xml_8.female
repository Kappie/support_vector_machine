I guess i'm supposed to write about things that happen in my life, what i think about things. . . to be honest, not a whole lot happens! that's ok though:)  Actually, this past weekend my boyfriend, Erik, moved into EKU--- so i'm kinda nervous about that (eek!) We've been together for about 9 months (which is a long time for the both of us lol). . . so hopefully i'll get to go visit him on the weekends.  For those of you who don't know me, i guess i could at least explain the whole "stiletto Fran" title.  First of all, if you know me you know i love shoes with a passion-- heels, flip flops, boots sandals, blue ones, pink ones, furry ones--- i think you get the picture lol.  And, well, the name Fran is a nickname that a couple of my crazy friends gave me-- it's a long story which evolves getting kicked out of fast food places and moms that can't hear, so i won't bother to explain!  I'm a senior and i feel like i should still be 12, so it's kinda crazy.  I've always dreamed of being a fashion designer, but now i'm not so sure-- talk about changin your mind at the last minute lol.  I either want to go to U of L or SCAD, which is an art school in Georgia, it just depends on a lot of different things.  I have about two hobbies which include shopping and sewing.  Other than that, i can't think of a whole lot to tell at the moment. . . so, when i think of something i'll get back at ya! later ~luv~ cara
