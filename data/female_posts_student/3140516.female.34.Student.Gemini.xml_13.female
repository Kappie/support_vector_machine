I was accepted into Brown College in Minnesota, to the Culinary Arts school, and I have been SO damn busy I have barely had time to think, let alone visiting my blog. It's been over a month.  AND...today is my birthday. Yep...I am 34 years old. Today I feel so much older than that.I am so tired today, and just not feeling well. And tonight my little brother and one of my little sisters is taking me out for drinks. Plus I am helping another brother move. Plus there is T-Ball for my almost six year old, and a bunch of other stuff I have to do today....and none of it involves sleeping in, goddess damn it. I should have told everyone to screw themselves, I was gonna spend all day in bed, but I really can't do that, not if I want little brother off my freaking couch and my son to not be crying all night. Have you ever missed someone so badly that it makes you hurt? I mean really, physically hurt? There is someone I miss so badly that it feels like an icepick has been driven through me...I wish I could just call and say, I need to see you, and go there and be okay, not scared of the future, not feeling lonesome for their company. Just BE THERE with them, ya know? Maybe you don't. Maybe I have finally snapped. Maybe old age is catching up with me, because I sure feel a lot older than 34 today...
