I've been having a hard time lately at school. I've been putting in a lote of effort though. My schedule goes like this: Honors Chemistry 1Honors Environmental ScienceHonors English IIIHonors Integrated Math IV QuantativeA LunchHonors Civics and Economics (a bunch of 10th graders)Spanish II (they don't have honors for this class)Newspaper (Editor and Cheif) -Also, Mrs. Kraft the Student Council teacher wants me to run for President, I want to, but the question is: Am I doing it for myself? Or for Mrs. Kraft? For the school? Or for who? -I broke down today at school though, I started crying in the hallway, what was I crying over? Stress I suppose, and I was extremly overwhelmed. My homework is rough, not rough, but when it adds up in all 7 classes it covers my night. Boy, am I glad I don't have a job I'd be screwed over. I'll stick with Church. I'm so depressed right now... I better go do stuff, before Charlie(Hurricane) comes. Love,Nikki
