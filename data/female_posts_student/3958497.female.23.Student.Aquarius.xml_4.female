(duh). i used to want to be a scientist so i could find a cure for aids.i used to want to be a vet so i could work with animals all day and help them.animalsi can handle. they are not only trainable, butabove all-loyal. if we could only expect a 1/4 of the faithfulness animalsexhibit in ourselves-a breed supposedly so much higher, so much better off.(that was random tangent!)no, instead we lose ourselves to everything but nothing at all. we lose ourselves to life..[t0] big televisions, washing machines, cars, compact disc players, and electrical tin can openers.[we choose] sitting on the couch watching mind numbing, spirit crushing...shows....which is not to be ignored..but we makeit our ends. we ignore/neglectmore than we shouldthe obvious stuff-the stuff that's free-love/trust/loyality(i dont know if that is a word, but in this context it will be! ;) ). we become religious to this world-relig: to worship-we worship this world/money/power/fame.meanwhile, our bodies are crying out for help. the signs are apparent-fatigue, depression, anxiety, all that shit-and instead of listening, we keep running the hamster's wheel, the ferris wheel of lights as we ride the ride alone or with others-doestn matter-in the man's dream-we are alone.we're american, no 1 proud fastfood nation, with our bellys protruding from our belt buckles as we shove more french fries in our mouth. there was a time when our fat, arrogant nation emphasized the individual=fostering his needs/rights/unique talents. (dewey, et al.)these concepts were lost with ritalin, longer school days, less recess for kids, less parental rights, morepsychoactive drugs for kids to numb/mask the pain, crappier lower paid teachers- local govt is too busy pumping money into worthless causes like the war on drugs or overpaid govt officials, less parental responsibilty for familial ties-work longer and harder to make more to make more to make more to spend less time with the family that you are supposedly making all this money for-to foster their growth.instead you foster their material dEsire.you beget kids that want it all.and it's never good enough. their is that hole that all the belongings in the world dont fill. and so the kids stumble and fall, meander here there either chasing this stupid fucking neverending wheel or they try to find other reasons for life.(cause you know how easy this is being a youth!)stumble,fall, stumble, fall. and one day if they are lucky, they fuck up, wake up, rise up.otherwise, they continue on the same path, wondering why they cant be like all the ppl they see below, seemingly soooo happy, why they cant have more power/money/prestige, why they cant have better kids cause they have really have invested sooo much, to omuch, for the kids to make a mistake like they did! heaven forbid!and the kids, meanwhile, are stumbling regardless of weather they see it or not. they are kids, and no one is perfect,, even the parent instilling the so called worthy values. not to deny the ethic of work, but there is more than life.not to deny stability, cause it's worth gold. but there are other ways to have reliablity, stablity, and wholeness than the the standard route.i cant even remember who wrote it-some famous poet-said something about the less beaten path and how he's so glad to have taken it. it's true.we lose it when we get old. we want to fit in, to be just like everyone else-so we can build our esteem-when all along we never realize that esteem isnt build like that-it is build from within, from above. we will nEVer be whole or complete until we look elsewhere:something more, something greaterand start to replay and live our dreams of past. haha.i dont think my thoughts flowed very well, but i dont think they currently are supposed to flow, just fly, thx.
