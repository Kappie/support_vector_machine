She was nagging incessantly and the more she continue to rant, the more her fire within got fueled (whoever say me keeping silent meant it will blow over??).   Then   LAGI best.. after I decided reluctantly to stay at home and succumb to her warth, the she tell me.. I dun need to paint my room already!! cos why?  She realized not enough paint...wah niaoz eh haiz  So I slept this last day of my holidays to the begining of the start of the last academic semester of my entire life (supposedly). Now I'm here, feeling like an idiot bored to death. Hahha. Well, something to be proud of myself ( though it's so pathetically insignificant). I started to plan my BuDGET!   HURRAYYY!!   Thanks so much baby..hehe for making me want to save up. Because of you tat's why I have more inclination and motivation enough to save up. Muacksss. Sighz.. I miss him so much. Really wish I could pinch his nose again.. sobs. I miss Fuzzy too..though he's gone to heaven.. sobs.. Sighz..  Can't wait for my baby to come back... gotta pamper him since he had such a horrendous time in Indonesia. Really admire his determination to stay on sometimes. It's such a chore to hear him at the other line away being homesick and being tortured under the hands of unscrupulous commercial employers.   Well.. such is life eh? Like what my blog says...moreever, he's going through pretty tough emotional times now. Sighz  Ok, me going downstairs to jalan jalan by myself already. Maybe get some tibits back. Oh, gotta help my mum transfer her ERS into the account. Bleah.   Laterz
