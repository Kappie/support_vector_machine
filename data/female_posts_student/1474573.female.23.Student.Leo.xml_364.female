Well, people are just generally pissing me off left and right.  From people who start asking for things using their boss's name (like  that's  going to make me do it any faster) to people misreading my blog and thinking I don't like it when people get cryptic, (HELLO, I didn't SAY that, you fucking fool!!) I'm about ready to shoot someone.  I was supposed to babysit tonight, but it looks like that's been shelved.  In a weird way, I was kinda looking forward to it because in the 6 years since my friend has had at least one child, I have only babysat for her twice.  TWICE!  How funny is that?!  Maybe I'll go over there anyway, just to hang out...   SIGH...Maybe its PMS, but people are getting on my goddammned nerves today.     urlLink Guy , good luck on the job thing and  urlLink Taylor , I hope you work out whatever's upsetting you.
