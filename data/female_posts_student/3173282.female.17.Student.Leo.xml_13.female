It was hottttt! Then Amanda made her change it so she changed it to oldies! Haha but we got back to the flashbacks which were amazing. Clouds started comin in and we decided we should go in. Good idea cuz it was a monster storm! We went to this cute lil store and got REAL cokes! Hmm...saturday was a banger..!!! Let's just say i didn't go to bed until 5 am and had to wake up at 8 to drive to phili! Hotel Stefan was a success and i am forever in love with the song Roses by outkast. Hehahe. Yeah phili was gay yesterday for my sister's stupid soccer tournament. I felt like shit and i just slept the whole time. I'm all beat up....bumps on my head and bruises on my arm. Oh yah kristi thinks she's gonna fight me. If brandon was a man he would take care of his own problems, not have his bitch fight em for him. some people deserve to burn slowly while being tortured by rats. They are 2 of those people. LATER!
