I am going to get my degree in buisness then open a RESTAURANT! *w00t*  How exciting.   I am alone again...  My brother and Kyle left again.  My dad and Matt went to the beach and didn't even tell me. How weird. Oh well.  My mom and Hannah wont be back until 9:30.  It seems like everyone has something do do and someone else to do that thing with.  jacob has Kyle...  Dad has Matt...  Mum has Hannah..   Who do I have?  no one...
