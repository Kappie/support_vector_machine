Don't get me wrong its absolutely fabulous that Kym has moved in and Missy has moved out.  But I can say without a doubt that Kris and I have very ruffled feathers right now.  Kym has been very slow to unpack, but she hasn't been busy with work or getting ready for law school.  So Kris and I have been quietly grouchy.  I realize that with a new roommate that will certainly ruffle our feathers from what we are used to.  But that doesn't mean that I'm not worried about the year to come.  So far things have not gotten as bad as they were when I lived in Mayflower with a friend who never picked up after herself, and I will blow up if it ever does get that bad.  But I have talked to Kym a few times about things so I'm hoping that things will calm down.  Kris and I are also worried about losing our time to ourselves because Kym is a very social person.  Which is wonderful when you want to go have fun somewhere, throw a dinner party or something like that.  But Kris and I also love to spend time by ourselves in our bedrooms and just shut the world out.  I'm not sure if Kym will understand.  But I can't say that I got it right away.  Because around this time last year I was worried that I was a leper because Kris and Missy would spend a good deal of time in their rooms instead of in the living room and ktichen.  It took me a little bit to understand that this wasn't because they didn't like hanging out with me but it was more that they just wanted time to themselves.  I think that one thing that we need to do is sit down all together and talk about things and set guidelines and just try to understand where we all are coming from on the different issues.  This afternoon I finally got the cable internet back up and running at our apartment so I'm sure I'll be online more and I'll be able to post here more often too.
