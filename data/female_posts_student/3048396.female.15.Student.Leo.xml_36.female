It looks soo cool! We left on wall just yellow and the rest are sponged orange n green. It looks great. Can't wait for it to be normal again. We also re aranged my room...it'll be weird but now the couch can fold out into a bed so it'll work great when people come over n stay. So yeah thats pretty much all I did today...tho Kim came over and we did a work out that was on Fit TV. Haha...We were bored...it was amusing. So yeah. *sigh* Well Im going camping today with Tracy. It'll be tons of fun. Even tho I'll probably get called chunky by the guys up there again. *sigh* Fat...yes. I am. Eh. Oh well...So I probably wont get to write again till the 7th of July. Heh...thats supposedly when Im supposed to get married...Kim did this thing and it said that was the date....odd. Anyways. I'll give ya all the details bout my fun time when I get home...Maybe Tracy and I will do another fun foot thing...or finish our song. It'll be great fun. Sad thing is...I can't watch the cubs game today to see if I can see Ross...We leave before it starts...:( I thought it woulda been awesome to see him on tv...but I guess I can't Oh well...*sigh* I guess I have nothing else to ramble about and I'll catch ya in a week...
