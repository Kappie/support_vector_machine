Sigh. CLARIFICATION: I know both J and T are sick of this Hollywood Knights business by now. And I hear them all the time talking about being stressed out and busy and pressured. And I feel bad for them both. And I'm glad it's all over now so they don't have to panic anymore. It's nothing against either of you, so calm down. It's not like I don't see how much you're working!  JFC.  Everybody gets worn out. I guess it's just a matter of how we deal with it. (Oh, if only we could all complain.)
