Yesterday, when I went to my appointment, they couldn't find out what was causing my vertigo and headaches, so they scheduled me for an MRI and gave me meds.  All of which have not helped and actually I have been feeling worst.  i don't know what is wrong.  They said I may have a neurological problem.  Anyway...say a little prayer for me.  I love you all.
