(nicknamed "Baby Bible" by the students - very intense!), Intro to Ministry, Intro to Theology, Ethics I, Choir, and Intro to Metaphysics.  Winter Term: Intro to Ethics, Intro to O.T., Early Church History 0-843AD, Ethics II and a continuation of Choir.  As I joked with the advisor, if I live through the first term, I should have no problem finishing up the degree!  I will take a philosophy credit in the Summer and another next Fall.  My course advisor was the sweetest man, though much younger than I would have guessed.  I feel so much more at ease about my future now that I've got my courses in place, had a tour of the Faculty and classrooms, and met a few of the professors.  I felt like I fit in there.  It felt  right .  Everyone was spectacularly friendly and offered to help in any way that they could.      At one point of my visit (I was there for 1.5 hours!), I was sitting in one of the student lounges alone (my advisor had another meeting scheduled for 10am but wanted to give me a tour of the Faculty so I waited in the lounge.)  Sitting doing absolutely nothing, I spent my time glancing around the room.  Eventually I noticed an absolutely massive painting of a sad looking young woman on the back wall.  It was in desperate need of restoration so I didn't spend too long looking at it.  The only thing that struck me was this woman.  I ruminated over her drawn, sad face and thought that it was a sort of strange picture to have in a Faculty of Theology.  Shouldn't it be the painting of the Last Supper or Mary holding the Baby Jesus or even the  urlLink Return of the Prodigal Son by Rembrandt ?  Regardless, I mused to myself, "You look how I feel, lady."  I resumed my glancing around the room again, but eventually my eye found its way back to that painting.  I noticed something that I didn't see before.  In the far left corner of the painting, a hand is reaching out to the girl with a rose.  All of a sudden, I felt my heart melt and I saw this as a sign.  Yesterday I began praying  urlLink the novena to St. Therese of Lisieux , which promises to send you a rose to signify that what you have been praying for will be granted.  The rose can be a real rose, but more likely, it will come in the form of the scent of roses, a picture of a rose, or even a vision of a rose.   I was praying the novena this time for a sign that this move to Theology is the right thing to do.  It's possible that I'm reading too much into it, but to see this woman, who I likened to myself, being handed a rose from an unseen source (presumably God) in the Faculty of Theology ... I was startled and rejoicing at the same time.   Sound crazy?  Maybe.  But I sure feel a lot more faith-filled, excited and at ease about this life choice.     So, I find myself now in somewhat of a manic state.  I'm not used to this -- I've been operating on just-above-depressive lately -- but I feel rather free and excited and unusually happy today, certainly as affected by the circumstances of the day.  More to come...
