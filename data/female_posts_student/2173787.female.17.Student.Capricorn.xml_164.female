Smiling and joking with friends? Do you watch me spinning? Hoping the day never ends?  Do you see me on this merry-go-round? Spinning, spinning up and down?  Do you see a girl looking towards the future? As she was taught to do? That every move forward is torture? Knowing that she’ll never do?  Do you see me on this merry-go-round? Spinning, spinning up and down?  Do you see her run away? Wanting to stop chasing tomorrow? Just to start living today? Her eyes filled with sorrow?  Do you see me on this merry-go-round? Spinning, spinning up and down?  Do you really understand? That some days are wonderful and good? And others can’t keep up with demand? Do you think that you could?  Do you see me on this merry-go-round? Spinning, spinning up and down?  Do you see my moments in the sun? Times when I’m alive? How I feel when something is done? Catching the reason that I strive?  Do you see me on this merry-go-round? Spinning, spinning up and down?  Do you see me as a child? Doing what I love? Being able to let go and run wild? Dreams flying away like a dove?  Do you see me on this merry-go-round? Spinning, spinning up and down?  Do you see the shell I’ve made? Trying to reach my ideal? Stuck inside this painted cave? Is it even real?  Do you see me on this merry-go-round? Spinning, spinning up and down?  Do you look in my eyes? And see the fires burning? Looking to the skies? Filled with a sense of yearning?  Do you see me on this merry-go-round? Spinning, spinning up and down?  Do you see the top? The highlights of my life? Or is it just the drop? When I succumb to strife?  Do you see me on this merry-go-round? Spinning, spinning up and down?  Do you see my tears? Or watch for the smiles? See me face my fears? Or run from trials?  Do you see me trapped on this merry-go-round? Spinning, spinning up and down?  Do you see honesty? My struggle to be true? Do you see me? Or just a reflection of you?
