Pretty much the people who read it are the ones who write for it, right? cause i'm about to share some kinda personal stuff that's bothering me about my family... so deal with it.  if you don't know me, then well, i dunno.  just go with it.   Ever since returning home from camp even since the first week, I've looked at my family differently.  My mom was constantly nagging at me to do something when i was home for weekends even though i was so worn out from the week that all i wanted to do was sleep and lounge.  She constantly says the world doesn't revolve around me.  Sometimes I wish it did.  Other times I know that she should take those words to heart.  She tells us to do things to help out, but how often does she serve cheerfully?  I've learned at camp that a positive attitude goes a looong way.  I've gotten used to doing my own thing this summer.  Eating when I need, sleeping when I need, doing the chores I need when I need.  She doesn't understand this! She still tells me what to do and when, when really, I've got my agenda of stuff to get done.  She doesn't understand that I can do things myself.  The thing that kinda makes me laugh is that her own mother tells her the same thing 5 times in one phone call and she gets frustrated.  I told her with a smirk on my face, "Welcome to my world."  Ok, so that entire paragraph was on my mom only.  Sorry about that.  Now i'm going to shift the focus to my family in general.  I am so jealous of the kind of families some people have.  The kind where they can pray together and trust God.  It really frustrates me that the only time I hear prayer from my parents is before a meal, and then, only if it's lunch or supper.  I guess breakfast doesn't count or something.  When faced with large decisions or problems, aka finantial aid for college and finances in general at my house, we don't pray together.  There's not even mention of us praying apart.  I didn't even know my parents did devotions until a couple years ago.  To me, thats really sad.  It is sad that they don't know God like I know Him.  Not that I'm claiming to be an expert or anything, but over the summer, we've gotten close, me and the "Big Guy."  I wish I could show them this close relationship, but I don't know how.  I'm acutally dreading this time at home because while here, I don't pray as much and forget my devos.  I know it's my responsibility, but sometimes I feel like if I had had better examples, then I'd be better off.  Staying with Andrew and Ryann was interesting too.  They don't have that closeness either.  What kind of home are their kids going to be raised in?  One like mine?  I realize my parents are trying, but I promise myself that I'm going to set a spiritual example for my kids.  When problems come, pray about them.  Continuously.  Together.  It works.  I'm trying not to be bitter, but sometimes it's hard.   Those of you who have parents like mine, I empathize with you.  It's difficult.  Hang in there.  Make changes in yourself first.  (This list is for me as well as you.)  For those of you whose parents pray with them and in front of them, thank them.  Thank them for setting an awesome example for you to follow when you have your own family.  Then take initiative and be that person.  Peace out.
