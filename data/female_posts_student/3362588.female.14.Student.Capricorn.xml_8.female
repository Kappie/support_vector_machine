I met alot of cool people, like Tommy, and Brandon, and the other Brandon, and Aaron, and Hannah, and Trey, and Faith, and Katy, and Rachel, and.......  hehe.  And I met some weirdos like RJ, and Eddie, and Brian, and....  heh.   Had a great time.  Ruined my legs playing in the mud.  Totally scratched up and stuff.  It was alot of fun though.  I played gutterball most of the time.  Had a blaste.  It was just too awesome to tell about.  Beside, most of you have had to put up with my camp ravings anyway.  haha  Signing off -  Jack, the one who misses camp like heck
