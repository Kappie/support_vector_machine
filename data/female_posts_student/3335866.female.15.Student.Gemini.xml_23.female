If you know what I mean. Nevertheless, my mother decided to try to be a domestic goddess for the night and cook dinner. My mom is a kick-ass cook, but herchefdom can beschizophrenic. She specializes in everything from Shepherd's pie to crepes with green onions and beef. She took a cake-decorating course and can make the best frosting roses of anyone I know. Also, she can make dinner five nights in a row and then not touch the kitchen again for more than a month. My sister and I are quite adept at making burritos by now.    However,tonight she ignored all this and made steak and potatoes. Steak, corn and potatoes- and oh, the potatoes. These were not yourtypical wimpy potatoes. Normally, the potatoes my family eats are no bigger than your fist. Seriously, close your hand, imagine thatyou fist isa little smaller, and there are our spuds. Now, make a fist, make another fist, imagine another half a fist, and put them together. These were the potatoes of tonight. When I was called down for dinner I looked in the toaster oven and there they were, like foil-wrapped omens of the coming apocalypse. They scared the shit out of me. Nothing, I say  nothing , should be that big. It makes me want to cry. When one was cut in half and smushed on my plate it took up the whole thing- and this was a typical big dinner plate. These were potatoes that needed almost a quarter of a stick of butter. Mmm... they tasted great with A1 sauce.    All this led me to run upstairs for my made-by-American Girl (shut up) digital camera to document the madness. When I got downstairs and started snapping my entire family started mocking me and talking about how I was misrepresenting them by making it seem like we typically eat steak and potatoes. Ha ha. This from the same people who spent the entire dinner talking about the actors of  Bewitched  and who forced me to sit on a trash can when the supply of chairs let out. I have some pictures to show y'all, but I couldn't find the USB cord and crap like that. I had a jolly time tearing apart my closet looking for it, though. Thus concludeth the essay on dinner at my house.
