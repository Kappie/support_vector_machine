Not enough time to pray, reflect dadada… Yeah that’s my problem - procrastination.  I watched The Passion of Christ last Friday. Yeah it was probably then that it dawned on me that Easter is just around the corner. Man, that show was………..phew. I don’t know how to put it, but it was hard watching it. The PASSION of Christ I guess, that’s why its called. I’ve been learning the stories behind a few words lately. You know ‘passion’, when you say it, usually the first thing that comes to mind (for me lah) like some romantic passionate relationship kinda soppy yada yada. Hey, don’t get me wrong, I’m not some pervert. But really that used to be the first thought that entered my mind when I heard ‘passion’. I looked up my dictionary and The Passion is ‘the sufferings of Christ Jesus in His last days. Even passion-flower is ‘plant with flower supposed to suggest instruments of Crucifixion. PASSION man.  I cried a lot throughout the movie. I’m not someone who usually sheds tears while watching movies, but this was different though. I guess cos’ I never thought very deeply about what kinda pain, how much pain, emotional and physical Jesus went through. Yes, we do read that the Romans flogged Him and pressed a crown of thorns on His head, nailed his hands and feet dadada..  But I never really thought about it, you know. Like pictured it in my head that sorta thing. I guess the pain was so intense I could never picture something as gruesome as that anyway. But the movie did it.  Anyways, yeah that got me thinking. Easter is coming. What am I gonna do on that day? Will my heart be the same? Or should it be more grateful than other days? … Well, No. If I should be MORE grateful on Easter than on other days, I am in very very deep trouble. Cos’ it means that on other days I am less grateful of Jesus dying on the cross. But of course, Easter serves as a day we set aside for remembrance of His resurrection. That we can SHOUT and say YAHOO, He did it!  Let me remind myself though, Good Friday comes before Easter. You gonna shout and dance on Good Friday? Well, I don’t usually dance, not a dancer but anyways I think I’ll be reflecting on everything. What Christ went thru, why He went thru it, and what I should yadayada do.  Here’s a song by SmallTown Poets bout Good Friday and Easter. Written by Steve Hindalong.   Go on up to the mountain of mercy To the crimson perpetual tide Kneel down on the shore Be thirsty no more Go under and be purified  Follow Christ to the holy mountain Sinner sorry and wrecked by the fall Cleanse your heart and your soul In the fountain that flowed For you and for me and for all At the wonderful, tragic, mysterious tree On that beautiful scandalous night you and me Were atoned by His blood and forever washed white’ On that beautiful scandalous night  On the hillside, you will be delivered At the foot of the cross justified And your spirit restored By the river that poured From our blessed Saviour’s side
