My cat is really sick, so much so that she had to be at the vet all day yesterday and I have to take her back tomorrow.  Poor kitty.  Her temperature is 104 degrees and she lost a pound since I took her to the vet on Monday.  That is no good.  Yesterday wasn't overly productive due to football and running back and forth to the vet (in football traffic).  I also had a wicked sinus headache and went to see Lost In Translation.  Good movie.  Bill Murray was totally perfect for the role he played- a rather sad, washed up film star.  It gets the Jamie seal of approval.  And was much less disturbing than Thirteen.  Today I'm reading about archaeological theory.  I spent three hours (or so) reading a 30 page article.  That doesn't bode well for the rest of my prelim studying for the week, which kind of sucks as I also have to start planning for a linguistic discussion at the end of the week.  Yay, hooray.  And, dude.  I can't believe that it's almost October.  Fall hit hard in Ann Arbor, with temps already in the 50s with chilly wind/rain.  Ah, gotta love the Midwest.  Also weird to think that NU just started school last week, and that Cambridge doesn't start for yet another week (although I guess they are on a totally different system).   right.  back to theory.
