Am i putting this dream of being a wife, a mother. More to me then my God?Is it wrong to desire this life of a wife, and maybe a mother? Should i be praying about it? Meaning should i pray that God will grant me with this man? I know God will grant me with whatever pleases him... But my thinking is, am i desiring it to much? Am i putting to much on it? I hope i'm not... I'm not putting my life off for this man of my dreams... But i hope i am putting my heart off for this man... Thats an even bigger thing... Am i placeling my heart somewhere others cant get to... Well the thing on my heart right now is if my heart is on God... More then this guy... I pray it is...
