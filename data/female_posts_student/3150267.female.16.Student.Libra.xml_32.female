I have been waiting for this day to come so eagerly and when it actually came, I welcomed it reluctantly... i really wish to give u a call or juz send u a sms... but wat's the use... it's over anyway... *sigh* maybe u r rite... i should learn to let go too... i really hope that i could be like u, acting so carefree all the time n having the none-of-my-bussiness attitude... i wish i could be like u... but i can't... bcoz i m me... i can't show that i didn't care at all... i can't hide my feelings... n i juz want to tell u... i still can't let go... n i don't want to let go... maybe u think tt i'm stupid.. but it's just me bah...
