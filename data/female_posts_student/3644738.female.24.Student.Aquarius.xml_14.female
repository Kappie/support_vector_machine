I am recovering from a cold ). I'm running late cos I'm black...not my fault...genetics !!! So I just hop on any bus in the general direction...they run every 2 mins in London...literally hundreds of them 24/7â€¦I digress (for the benefit of US viewers)!!!   I get of the bus, fail to notice a plastic cord on the street...TRIP!!!!! Yes Trip and gash my knee...TO THE MOTHER FUCKING WHITE MEAT!!!!!!!!THE PAIN. Because I am who I am, my pride is hurt more than my knee (well at that moment) so I quickly pick my ass up...yes I TRIPPED NICELY...THE GOOD TRIP!!! and find a corner to SHAKE in and get over the shock of it all.    At this point the "Evening Standard" (London Newspaper) guy is looking at me...and I'm thinking bitch unless you have a band aid FUCK OFF!!!! Its times like these that you don't really want company...especially the company of a stranger so I hobble home and now my knee feels like Hell's fires are burning on it . However not as much as when I put salt on it...as instructed by my friend....YES I SCREAMED....I did the same the last time I fell over...I think it was the summer of 1987. Now my best asset is RUINED!!!!!!! I AM SO UPSET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Yes my legs were once my best asset...now my left knee looks like Freddy Kruger's face AAAAARRRGGGHHHH!!!!!!!!!   Well at least it isn't both knees ...maybe I can put an eye patch on lefty and call myself " I kneed Willie"  yes I'm a Goonies fan!!!! I'm surprised that I've got jokes....it looks hideous and it really hurts... I can't even bend it!!!  I was so close to crying but Regents Street is too public a street for that!!!
