And Anonymous is probably laughing right now because the fact that I am dedicating a post for a rebuttal infers that I do think and analyze too much.  I just hate when people make statements like that who don't even know me.  I wrote about one instance and Anonymous thinks he can just make a general statement about me like that.  Maybe he reads my blog consistently, but my postings are only small glimpses into my  real  life.    Is it so wrong to express what I am feeling?  That is normal.  Not over-analytical.  This is a blog.  My venting device.
