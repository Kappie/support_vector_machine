Cause it's between US not U... I'm realli sorry if my words are offensive.. you comments are hurtful enough to make me cry right in front of computer and on the fone with others. Stop it. I didnt offend you, the one i offended is sharon not you. you dont have to keep looking into my blog and comment anything i wrote.. and it was not meant for u.. it was meant for those whose who know who are they.. please, right here i'm begging you, dont keep peeping into my blog and stop it. It's not fun. in the first place, sharon offended me first, ever since last year i oreadi hate her, she herself know that too. why bother to stir up trouble? i'm toking sense right now... please stop it
