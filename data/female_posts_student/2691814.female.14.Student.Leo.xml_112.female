Bill has an awesome smoke machine so we smoked the entire house but first we had to take down the alarms in the house. So we did and we smoked the house and then we picked someone to be it. We couldn't see anything atall. Then bill turned on the smoke thing....now the smoke thing has a big skull on it so the smoke comes out of its mouth. Well i didn't know where i was but bill turned on the machine and it scared the crap out of me...i was right infront of it! Well i was fine after that but it was truely funny. I started crawling around and i kept bumping into josh until i found my lil corner lol. we invoked bloody mary again...which was cool...we had some reaallly funny parts too. lol it was just sooo much fun yesterday. I'm gonna call bill soon around 12 like he told me to so i can come over.   yes....im a dumbfuck lol
