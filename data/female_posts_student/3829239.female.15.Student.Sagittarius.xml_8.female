We had fun there got on the swings and climbed a tree. At Sam's we ran into Michael and Seantell from school, they know eachother from church and I never knew!!!! Yep. Well Alek danced a little bit.... Kevin Goes to College, the Stingers, and 33 West played. We didn't see 33 West, but I heard they sucked. So whatever. Anyway, Alek was great.
