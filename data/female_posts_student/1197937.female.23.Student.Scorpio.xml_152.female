"i can feel it in my fingers, i can feel it in my toooooooes..." (10 pts if you know which movie that's from. cuz somebody's keeping real score.) this is gonna be my year, the year of the ALMIGHTY MONKEY. that's right, it's gonna be ooh ooh aah aah all the way baby!! tentative goals (b/c i don't believe in resolutions) for this exciting new chapter of my life include the following: steer clear of carbonation, alcohol, and potential sex offenders; decide on using only ONE of xanga/blogspot/myspace (although some just call it being versatile); concentrate on growing out new bangs; become a vegetarian (does not apply to aquatic creatures, ie, salmon, lobster, unagi, and duck); break out groovy dance moves as seen on soul train; unload the serious junk in the trunk amassed during 2003; harass the poopies out of ppl with "real" stuff to do; manage personal finance, ie, start balancing checkbook, learn to invest, stop accumulating monstruous cell phone bills, errr...and other stuff like that; and last but not least, take some time off from livin' La Vida Loca to smell the LA smog. did i leave anything out?
