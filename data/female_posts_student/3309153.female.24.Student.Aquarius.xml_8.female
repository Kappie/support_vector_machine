Just for now it is "Word After Word" but only for the sake of marking a space in the blog world.  It is up to change.  So, what should we call this community of writers and non-writers? poets and dramatists?  We did brainstorm a few ideas in our last (and first) meeting.  What other good names have you uncovered under stones lately?  Please reply.
