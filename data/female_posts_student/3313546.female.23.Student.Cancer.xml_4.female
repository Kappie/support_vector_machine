I am very proud. I just went to the Hill on Monday, looked around, picked up applications at Alexander's, and for the Temp positions at the CU Bookstore, but I am really glad I took Tuesday to pamper and enjoy myself, and I insisted that Grandpa buy better groceries, so that my appetite will be more active. I.e. I am tired of feeling down because I am not happy with the food I eat. People are like animals in that, the quality and flavor of food improves the eating, and contributes to healthier habits.   Full time is cool.  It is July 28, now. I am kind of surprised how quickly I found a job. Maybe a good sign?  I am still carrying applications for two other jobs, Dairy Queen on the Hill, and Salvaggio's deli.  Tamara needs to get up here to find a job soon. I think.  Right now I am radical. I am feeling less Republican, even as the election grows near.   Right now, I am reading a book by Margaret Atwood, named "The Blind Assasin", she is a very Canadian writer, and I like that. I also started reading The Unvanquished lastnight at Trident, it is enrapturing. As before when I was reading Wild Palms and Go Down Moses, Faulkner manages to innovate everything, characters, language, etc...  I have very good news, to bear, that I am writing well, again. Not bad. What I need is a good beer, perhaps a celebration?  I am happy also, because, my library card at CU, works... Time to find more reading materials.   Adios, Su Amiga, Alisia
