Wade and Katherine get my "teh awesome actors" award, I was sooooo into the whole story, it made the book seem SO interesting, and I hated the book, lol. I saw everyone, Sternie, Rawlings, Rebecca, I was so glad I got to see them all!!   *sigh* I missed them so much. I wish I had come back. Maybe next year.       Definetly next year. ;)
