( okay 5 but still ) and what the hell would he get out of the movie? uhh nothing. that's what i thought. isn't that freaking ridiculous.. something to totally ruin your night.       yeah i'm sitting at home watching one of the movies i rented and breezy is all like do you want to go hang out with ramsey and hunter with me... yeah sure. i didn't have anything else to do and it would be fun to just actually hang out and shoot the shit then go to a party ( which is definately getting old) so she comes to get me.. and we go to the sulphur blockbuster to see if they have confessions of a teenage drama queen ( yes once more i'ma LOSER ) so we walk in and the guys that work there were like heyyyy and we both were all like hi and they just started busting out laughing and we were like what? but then we realized how that hi was totally nsync and sounded as though we rehearsed it or something. they dont have it so we move our business to hollywood ( on the way to hollywood.. these 2 40 year old grungy guys honk and are like waving at me and breezy--which personally made me want to vomit) well hollywood didn't have it either so we gave up on our quest and just went to ramseys. we take a journey on the motorcycles which was a lot of fun ( i've never been on one before ) that's something i definately want to do again. i rode first with ramsey and he probably thinks i'm the weirdest kid on the planet b/c i had that starbuck double shot commercial stuck in my head.. which is the rocky theme song.. but it's all like ROY, ROY ROY ROY and then they said i look like the person off space balls b/c i had on the helmet and they said it's a tiny body with a huge ass helmet or something... i haven't seen that movie in like 6 years so i had no idea what they were talking about... :-/ then i rode with hunter and we went 100.. and i was all saying pussy go faster and stuff and he was just busting out laughing. then we were all hanging out at ramseys and ramsey beat my ass in pool then it was time to go home...      i spent the night at breezys and we were all playing with little ricky ( her dog ) which is a total bitch and doesn't ever play with me it just barks at me. but he was being a sweetheart and hanging out with us. ooh but he passed gas in breezys face and it was freaking hilarious and we were rolling on the ground laughing. then we went on an adventure to walmart at like 3:30am.. to get hot oil treatments for our hair--we are such females, i know. actually breezy is.. she talked me into it. we went back to her house and she did her hot oil treatment but i passed and i just read a magazine then went to bed. what a crazy night.
