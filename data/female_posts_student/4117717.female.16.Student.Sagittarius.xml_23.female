After that it was time for the afternoon lifetime movie!!!! This one was...disturbing. It was about a 32 year old 6th grade teacher falling in love with her 13 year old student. Based on a true story too. And I mean, she had a kid who was 13 too. So wrong. I think they were trying to get across that they were really in love, but it was just...wrong. And this kid was really persuasive too. I just thought this woman though was weak to let a 13 year old seduce like that...I mean, isnt this channel about empowering women? So it turns out she gets pregnant by this kid, the husband finds out, and she goes to jail for rape. By the way she's telling this whole story from jail to the shrink. On her court date she gets parole, but is not allowed to see her 4 other children or have contact with the 13 year old boy. But they are still soo in "love" with each other and the boy keeps calling her and they end up running away together. But they don't get far, cause the police catches them and she goes back to jail. And it turns out she is pregnant again. So she has a total of two kids with the 13 year old boy. The movie ends with her still being in jail and saying she won't get out till 2005...All I think is that I hope they make a sequel cause I want to find out what happens after she gets out....  Um, then tonight I watched "Trading Spouses" on none other then FOX. Obviosuly it's on FOX. It was kinda stupid, just these two complete opposite mothers switch families for a week and you get to see the chaos. What happens when an overweight loud Massachusetts woman switches familes with a fit happy California woman?...Just a lot of bickering. I feel bad for the California family who got stuck with the Mass. lady cause she's a bitch.   I should maybe one day stop wasting my youth on watching television. I swear, I don't have many memories from my childhood, but the things I do remember fondly is about me basically growing up watching VH1. When it still had to do with music. Let's just say I know a lot of useless information on randon music careers. For example...Did you know the guy who wrote "Sex and Candy" (awseome song by the way) had parents who were shrinks? Or that group called Four Non-Blondes, who had one hit, only came up with the name by coming to the smart conclusion they were all brunettes? Yes, Thank you Pop Up Video, for letting me remember these facts for the rest of my life.
