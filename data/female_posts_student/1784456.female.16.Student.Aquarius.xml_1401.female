I've missed you blogger! *big hug* That wasn't pointless or anything... (Could've been spelt better!) Any way onto pointless ramblings.... Today I watched Russain Arc *Yes, I put arck* which is the first film to be filmed in one continous shot! Woohoo, go Russians! (Which involved watching a lot of subtitles and getting annoyed when they didn't put any on for some people) Geez, before it started this guy behind me was talking too loudly... God he was annoying. He started off saying stuff like how there's no basis for a relationship unless 'she's' attractive, even thjough before he was saying he was like 40 with two kids *what a catch* Like that guy can be picky. Then he was saying how these 16 year olds wouldn't go out with him *for god sake, don't let him be referring to us!* and the person next to him was trying to comfort him. I was gonna turn around and go 'no one would' but I didn't. Actually I probably would have punched him and said something really memorable... why can't I ever think of anything memorable?! *probably because when i do say something like that, I say a million things after it so it becomes less memorable* Ahh, I see.
