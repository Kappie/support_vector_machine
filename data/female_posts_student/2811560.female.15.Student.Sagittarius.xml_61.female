Last week, I was motivated....this week I'm definitely not. And plus, tomorrow I have babysitting after school and then a chorus concert right after that. And then on Wednesday, I have a band concert, and then after that, juries start, and I've only practiced mine like once. I'm just so sick of everything. I just want to hide out in my room for the next three weeks. Ugh, I'm in such an icky mood. I suddenly feel like crying and I have no idea why. Grr.
