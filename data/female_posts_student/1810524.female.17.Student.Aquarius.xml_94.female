(random trail of thought:S)  hmmm...i feel so :S its so easy to take for granted what u hav, not even taking into account that the thing u complain about is what others have always wanted! each day we take our things for granted n dont even think what it'd b like to not have it! like it only takes a second to loose someone close, to loose them forever- maybe with them not knowing the truth, or not feeling special and loved by you, yet it only takes a moment to make that tiny bit of effort to make them feel like totally priceless! coz if you miss that moment, you could loose it and everything forever....  the thing that really gets me is the thought of not being able to say goodbye...like either if i was to die, or one of my friends....to leave everything unsaid, ...... to leave feelings unknown, ..... to miss the chance to express how mch they care for me.... ppl say its never to late...but how is it not?! the longer you wait, the harder it is and the lower ure chances get! whilst your sitting happily at your computer, a person you love could've died.....
