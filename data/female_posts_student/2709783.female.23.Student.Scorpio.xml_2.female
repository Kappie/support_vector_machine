Usually, I run in the mornings anytime between 5:30 and 11am, depending on my schedule and level of motivation.  From my house I have a 3 mile loop and a 6 mile loop that I like, both of which are on scenic, quiet roads.  Unfortunately for my Olympic running aspirations, as of late, I have been leaving for work around 6, meaning that it's dark when I actually have time to run (as if I would get up at 4:30).  I decided to switch my running to the evenings.  Tonight at 8, the sun was still up, the sky was blue, and I set out on the 6 mile route.  It usually takes me a little over an hour, so I figured it would be dusk when I got home.  Wrong.  The hazy glow I have been mistaking for "dusk" outside of my window at 9pm is actually the glow from the lights of the tennis courts on Lake Shore. My deductive powers sometimes astound me, yes.  I soon realized that it's going to be dark, not dusk, on my way back home.    It is at this point in my run, along a half-mile strech with no houses, that Creepy Guy appears.  He is riding a crotch rocket and wearing Oakley knockoffs (I assume they weren't real) even though it is, as I noted earlier, dark.  Creepy Guy speeds by me once.  No big deal, I think, making "sunglasses at night" jokes to myself.  Then he turns around about a mile ahead of me and drives by again, this time with less speeding involved and more cruising.   Twice  more this happens, more slowly each time.  This exponentially multiplies the   Law and Order: SVU   episodes I am remembering that involve dark deserted roads and creepy guys on small motorbikes.    At the turnaround point of my run, I am at Lake Shore Drive.  It is the same distance to make the block and run down Lake Shore as it is to turn around and run back into Creepy Guy's well-laid trap that certainly existed.  The Lake Shore option involves running 3 miles down one of the busiest streets in northeast Waco, praying that I don't get run over by an early drunk.  I wondered where Jaimee and Coby were at the time.  In the end, I decided that I would rather get hit by a truck than raped by a guy who drives a quasi-motorcycle that sounds like a blender.  I hauled ass down Lake Shore.  And in the process of escaping, I had so much adrenaline from either a) having 18-wheelers whiz by me or b) imagining scenarios in which I kicked Creepy Guy's ass that I shattered my personal best on the 6 mile route by 6 minutes, an astounding accomplishment.  I almost wish I could be trailed by a frightening individual on all of my runs.
