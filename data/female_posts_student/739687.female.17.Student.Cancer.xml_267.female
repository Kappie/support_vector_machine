Some times I hate this stupid journal. I wish life was simple enough that I wouldn't need some online journal to express my views, rant my opinions or explain my trivial situations. I just want to live in the sunlight for the rest of my life. Screw complications...we create them ourselves. The only reason we do that is because we aren't content with what we have. We're just craving more and more. I think once we reach an honest state of contention...then the complications disappear. And I think we'd all be much more content if we quit wishing for so much more than we have. I hate having a complicated life. I can't say I create all the drama, but I tend to exacerbate it. Sometimes I just have to take a step back to realize that life isn't as bad as it can sometimes seem. Life still feels like a downer most of the time, but being a little down is alot better than being ragingly depressed. I'm just trying to get my life back. Because for a long time, I think I really lost it. I'm just enjoying my time making all those little mistakes.  Enjoy it, crazies. Later.
