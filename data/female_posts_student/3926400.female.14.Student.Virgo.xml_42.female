This element has no protons or electrons, but has a nucleus made up of 1 neutron, 2 vice-neutrons, 5 junior vice-neutrons, 25 assistant vice-neutrons, and 125 junior assistant vice-neutrons all going round in circles.  Managerium has a half-life of three years, at which time it does not decay but institutes a series of reviews leading to reorganization.  Its molecules are held together by means of the exchange of tiny particles known as morons.
