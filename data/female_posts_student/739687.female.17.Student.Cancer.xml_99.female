You have to become invulnerable to anything they can lay out at you. In other words, don't let them have any affect over you. You have to keep complete control, and never let them get the best of you. 2. You have to find out their behavioral patterns. Find out how they react upon certain situations, and how  they  manipulate others. Figure out what they do to maintain control over other people. For instance, how do they react when angry, and what tactics do they use to get the other party to give in to them? Discover their strategy for power over people. 3. Find their weaknesses and vulnerabilities. This often ties in to their behavioral patterns and their strategies for power. When people want reactions, they provoke it among people. Don't ever let them provoke the response they want from you. The goal is to own them, not let them own you. 4. Carry out a plan. You have to plan a strategy that targets their weaknesses, and carry it out. Never give in to them...there's always a possibility that they will be stubborn at first...but the plan is full proof. Eventually, it works out. 5. THEY ARE OWNED. Once you've got em manipulated, then you've won. You get what you want, and never settle for less. 6. Repeat when necessary. Enough said.  Haha...just thought that was kinda crazy like that.
