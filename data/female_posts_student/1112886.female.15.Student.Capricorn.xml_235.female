Well, we have one but there's an alienation between me and meredith which normally drives Chelsea to the Meredith side because Meredith's 1) smarter 2) cooler 3) easier to agree with as half the population just goes along with what she says. This bugs me. Esp. Barbara. Get your own opinions, jeez! Meredith honestly thinks I'm stupid. I normally avoid her but as I have more classes with her than people in my own grade, this proves difficult. Enough bashing other people.  I don't particularly like my advisory. I like about 4 people in it (sadly, this includes myself. I'm allowed to like myself.). Plus there's only one interesting person. Well, I guess me fighting everyone else could be interesting. Bethany, you're the interesting person if you would like to know, but you've probably already assumed this. Everyone is so girly. And Californian. Being Californian is ok, but being a valley girl and using like every other word is kind of too much. I know I use the word a lot, but compared to my advisory, I'm a regular tomboy. I hate being outnumbered by shallowness.
