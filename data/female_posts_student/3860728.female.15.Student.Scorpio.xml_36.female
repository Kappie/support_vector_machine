I either get labeled as black or asian.. but i'm neither. It seems all of the asian kids except me to be one of them and do the things i do, and all of the african-american kids expect me to do the stuff they do... if i hang out with asian kids i get critisized by the black kids and vice versa.. ah.. its shit. Maybe i should start hanging out with the other asian/african american kids.. oh wait.. there is none. hmmmmm oh well... i'll figure something out.
