I have undergone numerous life-altering experiences, and all have profoundly affected my academic, personal, and spiritual life.    **The discussion below is rather long-winded and detailed, so unless you're bored or truly would like to know about the spiritual battle I've gone through, go ahead and stop reading here.**  In light of the upcoming Ash Wednesday, I am realizing that I am closer to God than I have ever been.  The frightening part is that it took being furthest away from Him and experiencing a completely different religion and spiritual ideology in order to finally be brought back.  I consider myself to be a pretty open-minded person, so I tend to shy away from labeling one particular sect or group as "influenced by demonic forces".  It's difficult for us as humans to label what is evil and what is not.  But I truly believe in this quotation: "The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."  For 22 years I didn't want to believe in the existence of Hell, because I wanted to erroneously convince myself that a loving God would not send anyone to such a place.  I have now come to understand that such a place does indeed exist, but it is the result of God giving us free will; He cannot force humanity to love him, becuause then it wouldn't be love; it would be something else altogether.  Horrible, evil things exist in this world, but not because God would will it so; but becuase humans fell from grace.  That being said, God has used that to everyone's advantage and given us the possibility to freely return.  Cuban Santeria and Brazilian Candomble are incredibly fascinating sects of the African diaspora, and have influenced the course of Afro-Latin history.  It has been a pleausre to study them in the academic realm, but (as I tend to often do), I inadvertently became too personally involved.  You see, as much as Brazilians or Cubans will try to say that "Oh, there's no problem, no conflict; we mix African religion with Christianity all the time"--there IS a conflict; the African ideology maintains that there is no sin, that it is a social construct that we humans design from birth on.  They don't believe in Hell.  It was so easy, so comfortable for me to go that route, because is it easy for anyone to say "Christ is the only way to Heaven.  He is both the Son of God and God manifestated in the flesh.  No one reaches Heaven except through Him."?  I so desperately wanted to believe that there were multiple ways to paradise, that God works through multiple pathways.  I have come to fully comprehend, to understand, that that is simply not the case.  My problem all along was that I was blindly accpeting some pretty fundamental principles of Christianity without truly understanding them.    Some might say that it's dangerous to question those principles, but it is by questioning them that I came to understand them.  The issue really isn't so much if you question, but where.  I was obviously looking in the wrong place and asking the wrong people; I honestly didn't know this at the time, but God considers it an abonimation to seek answers through "mediators", "seers", or those who may or may not have the ability to tell you about your future.  There is only one mediator between us and God, and He died on the Cross.    The tip-off, the red flag, was the hour or so long disussion I had with the Brazilian Candomble priest in Sao Paulo sometime last July.  He flat-out asked me: "If you are made in the image of God, what makes Christ any different from you?"  He openly acknowledged the contradiction between his line of reasoning and the Bible, but he was using quotes from the scriptures to illustrate his points.  I look back on that and a chill goes down my spine; unbenownst to me, I was basically having an argument with the devil.  Not to say this man himself was evil; I don't believe that.  But it's obvious to me now who was working through him.  And to think that abomidable creature was so close to having me convert to a different religion.  The bastard doesn't hook people by having them worship him directly; he gets them by having them leave Christ indirectly--through doubt, miscommunication, and misunderstanding.  During that conversation I knew in my heart that he was wrong, that Christ was different from me.  But partly due to the language barrier, I didn't know how to explain it.  But it was mostly because I didn't understand it.  Now I do understand it, and a life-time of thank You's could never possibly be enough.  How else could one possibly explain it?  I had the Holy Spirit working through me, to bring me back.  "Back" in a relative sense, because while my heart has always been where it's supposed to be, my mind has been elsewhere.  Now they're both in sink.  And knowing now that my cousin Brandi is going to live, that she's been given a second chance, only further solidifies my faith.  How could you possibly explain all THAT?  Going from a 6-months-to-live prognosis to "Just kidding--it's not even cancerous!"  God performed a miracle.  It's a simple as that.  Perhaps I should write a book.
