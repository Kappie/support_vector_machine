Then he said he was talking with Ryan and Alex and I came up... what's new?  Anyway, we both decided that it would be a good idea if we broke up.  It was more his idea than mine.  We're still friends and there's no hard feelings so I glad for that, but it still makes me feel like a rotten bitch.  He told me I shouldn't feel that way but I can't help it.  I hate seeing any of my friends hurt, and knowing that I probably hurt him makes it worse.  But it is a good idea because of what we're doing after high school.  There was just no way it was going to work out.  So I'm going to take my own advice now and stay away from guys.  Like I keep telling Sam.  That's what I'm gonna do.  There's no point in looking if I'm just going to be leaving, so fuck it.  I'ma be single 'till I settle down somewhere, wherever that may be.  Illinois, Arizona, Washington (yeah right), Utah (don't ask), Kansas, hell who knows where?!  Just no more guys.  Apparently I'm not ready, so I'm done.  I'm just gonna sit back and love the single life, cuz it can be seriously fun. later dayz
