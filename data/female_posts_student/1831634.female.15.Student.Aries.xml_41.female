I got up and got online.  chuan talked to me!  said that I was supposed to go over at 1.  so I did!  but I was 10 minutes late cuz of my parents.  *sigh*  ah, well.  it was only me and kailing... but according to him, we were loud as heck.  hahahaha.  and I was very hungry.  =D  and I ate all his blue raspberry jolly ranchers.  those things are gooooood, man.  so we worked.  a bit.  well, more than we did before, anyways.  lol.  which isn't really saying a lot...  -__-;;  so that was that.  then we talked to jack online and got him to go over at 6.  I left at around 7.  hahahahaha.  we really didn't get much done.  all I really remember is sitting at his computer and typing away.  either at script or on aim.  lol.  wow.  sunday was kinda anticlimatic...  -__-;;  so then I came home and finished up all my leftover weekend homework.  I was so dreading school on tuesday because of biology grades... then I found out we got a 103!  so I'm happy as a beaver right now.  =D  and on monday night, my parents dragged me to open house even though I was supposed to be at an orchestra rehearsal....  hahahaha.  but I told bartley about it beforehand, so it should be all good.  =)  note:  going to open house is useless if you're not failing.  I'm serious.  I went to talk to humanities teachers.  wait in line for ten minutes.  my parents get up there and stanford say to them: "sunshine's doing fine.  nice job."  and move on.  then to algebra!  walker's talking to someone's dad for like 5 minutes on how the daughter needs to improve and such... then she says to my parents "sunshine's a marvelous math student.  no complaints.  her class loves her."  (actually, they USE me, darnit.  not v. cool at all.)  then didn't want them to talk to plasterr... so went to lux.  she just said "she's doing fine".  then on to biology.  kite was talking to this guy for like HOURS... about not taking too many honors classes and attending tutorials and such... and then she says to my parents, "sunshine is a great student.  she does her best on everything and everything is always above and beyond."  then my mom asks her if she needs to push me.  and kite says "no, she's very self-motivated.  from what I can see, she does everything well because she wants to."  and it felt v. weird being there and hearing her compliment me when she ususally ignores me in class.  -_____-;;  yaaa.....  then art.  said I show lots of potential, yadda.  french.  stip not there.  whoohoo.  so basically... open house = big waste of time.  except for when my parents were talking to jack's parents.  then it was a bit strange.  both his parents are so freaking SHORT.  anyways.  got home.  got online.  fooled around.  yadda.  got 98 on speech that I didn't practice at all!  felt v. proud of self.  lisa got a 85 and jack a 82.  o__O;;  dunno how they did that...  this person sitting next to me just went up there and MADE UP a speech and got a 84... TOTALLY ad-libbed it.  and he's one of those bad ppl, too.  the bald guy.  -__-;;  and natalie cordell went up there and made up her speech, too.  she has an autistic brother and she started crying in the middle of her speech...  then she sat down and said she felt like crap [crap is an euphimism...  -_-;;] b/c she did speed that morning.  -_________-;;  am highly worried.  then the bald guy actually TALKED to me... I nearly had a heart attack.  he said I was "very quiet".  HAHHAHAHAHAA.  *coff*  and so ends my lovely life.  kinda.  lol.  english test was FREAKING HARD.  *sigh*  ++sunny
