Now, I am occupied with stress, worries, pain, depression and sadness. My friends seemed to be leaving me one by one.. Everyday I would wake up with the hope of receiving some messages from any friends, as it shows they care? I am grateful to God for giving me a group of close pals, and that they had brought me laughter. When I was sad, they consoled me. When I cried, they comforted me. When I needed them, they were there for me.  But why is God bringing them further from me now? We are all separated into different institutions and have lesser chances to hang out. Perhaps God is showing me how tough is my fiendship with them.  But God, why did you bring him into my life when you never intended to let him stay? I don't know the reason for his leaving and I don't know God's reason for bringing him into my life in the first place. Perhaps God want to give me an obstacle to go through in order to become independent and emotionally strong? Perhaps by doing this, I would treasure my new friends, everyone I come across with more care and genuine love? If sacrificing "him" for all these "love" and "attention" i give to others, then it is worth it.  I believe God would make my life a better one. I might be depressed, sad and could not get over "his incident" yet, but i believe God would make my life a much better one by bringing someone who loves me more than "he" does into my life again. This is the faith I hold for God and I pray that God will show me the way to light and happiness. I am tired of being sad everyday... I seemed to be cheerful and smiling all the time, but I don't know is that the "real" me or is that just a mask of my own. I missed those times with "him", my friends. I seemed to have lose the courage to take a further step into my next stage in life because I fear of failure.  I wanted to give in my best effort in everyone, in everything I do, but it seemed rather difficult for me. The more I give, the more I would lose.
