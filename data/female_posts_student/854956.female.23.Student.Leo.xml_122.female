It's gotten me really pumped up to start working with SAUM in a couple weeks w/the after school program!  I love working with kids... especially kids that are fun and that are good like Trinity.  Anyhow, we had a nice week, and she told me lots of cute stories.    Next week I start the rest of my training for my job.  I'll be taking several classes on different topics related to my job... I think it'll be pretty fun.  :-)  I'm also getting excited about school starting, believe it or not.  But, then again, I always start the semester out really optimistic and happy about classes.  :-P  Well, that's all now... I'm doing laundry right now... and there's a possibility that Kim will be calling me in a few.  I shall post something later...
