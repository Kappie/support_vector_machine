My mom wants me to pass my motomarine license, but I don't think I have time for the courses (plus, they're in English). Blah. Anyway, I'm excited - I want to do water skiing, I've never tried before (I was too weak). :P  Oh, I didn't mention my schedule yet, right? Weekends will also be used to go to cottage, probably.  Well, this weekend: cottage 12-16: driving courses 19-22: away in laurentides (staying at hotel, water park, seeing a play - and my friend's dad is paying, whee!) 26-?: in NB, visiting grandma  August First week: probably still in NB 9-13: horseback riding camp 27-29: Toronto, CNanime (not sure if we go yet)  Talking about anime... turns out that if I were a guy, I'd be seme. *blink* I wanted to see which cute uke is most like me, but er didn't work out. -o-   urlLink     The Yaoi Selector: Which Uke are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    September 1st (a Wednesday) is back to school. -.- First semester I have English, biology, sociology and chemistry (should be fun). Second term I have accounting, French, calculus, and a free. Oh, how I fear calculus! *shudders* I tried going to websites and see what it was about, and I didn't understand at all. -o- At least I have a free, so more time to work on that... like I will. :P
