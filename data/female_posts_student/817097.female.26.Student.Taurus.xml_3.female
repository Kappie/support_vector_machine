Hallelujah!  Thank god.  There isn't enough tequila in the world to get me through another year of this.  I've learned tons of stuff.....now to apply it and hopefully make some money in the process.....  In my free time, I've been studying up on a new language....Croatian (thus explaining the date/time stamps).  My new boyfriend is actually Croatian and his family opts not to use English often in my presence.....therefore, the paranoia in me has driven me to attempt to learn the language....That way they can't talk about me behind my back.  Word of the day:  cherry-cheshnya-spelled w/o all of the cool letters....
