Let's reflect:  I go to babysit the bad kids (aka Gavin-8 and Eleanor-6, the kids who try and rape me/he grabs himself in front of me.) I start making them pizza and everything is fine. But as they finish they start getting gross, like "You must wear a really big diaper?" I'm sorry what? I resond, "Yeah Gavin, at least I'm potty trained!" And he goes, "I'm potty trained!" So I said, "You're right, last year was a big year for you!" FUCKER! Then that freaky cousin who lives in the attic comes down and sees them terrorizing me and offers these words of advise: "I'm feeling really dark, if you want me to discipline them."  So we go outside and play. He rides his bike, she rides her rollerblades. Well, she actually can't ride them and is constantly complaining. I go inside to bring the dog out, but instead run into crazy-cousin, Danielle, who asks me to help her try and stretch her corduroy pants. So we pull and pull for five minutes. Eleanor is pouting excessively and wants to go inside and watch Spy Kids, but the sound doesn't work. She insisted on watching it WITHOUT the sound, but I told her no. Finally, I put them to bed. Well before that, I again had to help stretch those stupid pants.  Now the fun begins. I go downstairs and read some  Harry Potter  for about an hour after I put the kids to bed. Their STUPID dog is barking and running around. I secretly cursed him under my breath. But then he kept biting the curtains, it was really odd. Right as I turn on the TV to watch Sex and the City, I look over my shoulder at the curtains and see Gavin sitting there smiling at me. When the hell did he get there? I freaked out and screamed! He said he had been hiding there for a really long time. But then he was asking me when his parents would get home and begging me not to tell them. I told him I wouldn't tell as long as he went to bed right then and there. Then the dog begins to shit on the carpet. I grab him, sprint out side, and slam the door. Thus realizing that the door was locked and I was now locked outside the house. I left the living room with dog crap on the floor and Carrie and her friends watching naked fireman at some even on the TV. Great, just great. Then I remembered that her mom left a key in the patio. So I sneak across the lawn without shoes on to go into the patio and get the key. The parents finally came home, and first thing, asked if Gavin was tired (he had been to a sleepover the night before), my response? "He didn't seem too tired!"
