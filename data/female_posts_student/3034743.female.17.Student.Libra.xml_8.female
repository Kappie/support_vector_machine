It was the funniest thing. We were looking at some shirts (This stupid lady took the shirt that I wanted, and it was the last one in that size. Oh, and she was obviously too big for a medium, but she wanted to try it anyways, because they had no larges either. All they had was that one medium and a whole bunch of XL and XXL. What the heck? Ugh! I so wanted that shirt, but oh well!)...anyways, as I was saying--we were looking at some shirts and somehow my mom's foot gets caught in this string of a bag. Well she goes to walk away and her foot is caught, and it totally causes her to fall to the ground. She was so embarassed! (Then again so was I) I felt bad for her, but not too many people saw, so I suppose all is well. That was totally the highlight of my day so far! Ciao!
