The younger one was gonna get married this September but the wedding was just called off. She's had a really tough life. When she was a teen, she was buliamic and suicidal.. but she's past that now. But it still makes me worry about how she's feeling right now. My mom said she's really embarrased and really upset... understandable.     My mom also said, love is hard, (that's not what I wanna hear) that a lot of people have trouble with it.... arg. well I just hope none of my family or friends have to deal with stuff like that. gtg
