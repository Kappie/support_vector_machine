Toshiasked. "Sure." Then, Toshi went to pick up sugi while I was cooking hot pot.Hot pot iseasy to cook, and you don't reallyneed a lot of other food togo with it. So, we just waited for 30 mins for preparing.Oh! The hot pot was so hot andspicy evenfor me. We were enjoy hot in late night ( around 2:00 in the morning). That was really good for some reason. We really liked it and happy about it.  urlLink      urlLink    星期一，半夜兩點。敏和我在看我們上次去法拉盛吃火鍋的錄像時，一致認同肚子餓。於是我就說要不要現在吃火鍋，敏說好噢，打電話叫山一起來。敏開車去接山，我就準備火鍋，火鍋很簡單，簡簡單單的吃的話。大概只用了半個小時就準備好了。三個人邊看電視邊吃火鍋，火鍋超級辣！！真的，我都覺得超級辣！吃的我們汗流不止的。哈哈，不過真的是很enjoy的一件事哦！下次有機會，再來一次哦。
