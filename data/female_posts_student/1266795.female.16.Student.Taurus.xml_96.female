Sacramento was fun, but it makes Indy look really busy and hectic. (I'll provide details later.) We're traveling to SanFran again in a few minutes, where Nat'll show us around today and go back home, but we'll stay in SanFran for a couple of days.  I have no idea when the next time I'll be near a computer is, so HAVE FUN, KIDS! I know I am!!! :)  "I never tire of being useful."
