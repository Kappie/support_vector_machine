I don't know the numbers on Xboxes and Playstations, but a study by the  urlLink Yankee Group  has found that  58% of mobile gamers are women.  However only 17% of women purchased games, while 29% of men did.   Make  urlLink Lady Sia  happy, go pick up a  urlLink Gameboy Advance .  Read the  urlLink Yankee Group Press Release .
