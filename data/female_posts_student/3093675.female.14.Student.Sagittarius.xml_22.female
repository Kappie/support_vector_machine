I  got these new sunglasses yesterday- they have clear lenses, but there's UV protection-  urlLink click here  for a pic if you still don't get it. Anyway, because of these glasses, my dad has decided that i am having an identity crisis and believe that i am Buddy Holly. Haha now that Weezer song comes to mind: "Oh wee-oo I look just like Buddy Holly..." etc, etc. Damn I have a habit of rambling about really stupid shit. I really gotta stop that. So what else has happened since yesterday... I decided to try to pierce my own ears. Um, no. Not fun. I succeeded only in creating a small indent in my right ear and causing a lot of unnescessary pain in my ear. I really should really get someone else to pierce them for me, but i don't want to go to that stupid Claire's place (i swear its so stupid in there i can't BREATHE) and my parents would never take me to Flat's Tattooing and Piercing. Fuck. I wish i had friends who knew how to do piercings. Fuck fuckety fuck fuck fuck. Anyway, Now ER is on tv, and I'm still bored. Goodbye.
