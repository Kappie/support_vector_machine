Lets see here....*scratches head, knowing full well that it makes you appear like you are thinking...when really you are procrastinating*...  The only news I really have is that every single Mona Shores choir that went to Festival got straight ones. That means that we get to skip a day of school to compete at State. Which is always nice.  The Spring concert today showed me how great Mr. Lawton is. Sure...he can be a little flaboyant sometimes, and if he didn't have a wife and 3 kids I'd have serious questions about his sexual orintation...but he is one damn good teacher.  After watching all the higher leveled choirs perform today...I have to say it kinda depressed me.   It made me think...why can't I be good at that? Why can't I have something that interesting to say I am good at and am proud of?   I am not really good at anything.  I can't sing, I can't act, I can't dance, I can't play sports, I can't tell stories or jokes well, I'm not labeled 'hott', I am not coridanated, I suck at driving, I am not artistic, I am only a good student leaning on the side of average, I have little fashion sense, and I am lazy. I have no idea what I want to be when I grow up.    Basically all I know is that you have just wasted about 30 seconds of your life reading about all the things I can't do.   THAT, and I am a orange piglet with yellow dots and light blue lipstick.  Song of the Day: 'The Sweater Song'- Weezer
