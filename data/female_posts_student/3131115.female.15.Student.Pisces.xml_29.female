We're listening to "Im Lost Without You" by Blink 182 extremely loud..it's Bills song to me. I love it so much..it makes me sad:(. It brings back memories too. I'm so glad that she's here. I've missed her so much. We were going to go swimming but we'll probably wait until Bill gets here to do that or something. Bill is coming over when my mom picks him up on her way back from work. Now we're listening to "Stockholm Syndrome" la la la...William bought me the White Pont CD today:) I'm so happy. My last post was confusing..:-/, for some reason I STILL feel sad, but I'm happy. I dont know how to explain it. *sigh*..I'm leaving now..
