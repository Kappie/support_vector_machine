I failed, not really failed, I got half of the the total items. What happened?! I WAS MENTAL BLOCK! too bad.. the test was quite easy, infact, many of my classmates got a pefect score! Then, me?! hahaha! half! what a quiz... tsk3! I just pray that I can cope with the lessons soon... I want my brain back to NORMAL! I repeat... BACK TO NORMAL! Maybe, my mind is still adjusting but, does my brain had enough time to adjust?! weird. This week was also not that good for me, I find out the results of my tests... I'm not satisfied with it! Man! I'm not normal!!! Last wednesday... things went the way it shouldn't be... I left our Research Project in our corridor, I bumped my head somewhere, I had colds, My paper bag slipped, and blah, blah, blah... hahaha! so amazing! Can you believe it happened in a day?!... my goodness! but I'm ok na. It really happens... for me?! a lot of times... but they're just trials... it's just annoying sometimes, because I've had enough... and it still happening... It will pass soon... I hope!... hehehe...
