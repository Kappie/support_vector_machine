FunkyWinkerl3ean: yes So Monday at school i'm going down! Yea, well today in summer band we learned more sets. One of them KC and I take  huge steps! not kidding big. Then we had a water fight. We (the popipuers)decieded that we would go to Popipu beach and sit out. So we did (inside joke). We did 15 sets this week w/ music. My poor brain is tired!
