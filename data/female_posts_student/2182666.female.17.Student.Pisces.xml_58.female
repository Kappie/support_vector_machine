EWWW ok so im not good at telling people to f off so i just tell myself im never going to see him again and it's not a big deal. so i go to my car and i see him drive off staring at me. then i realize my pump is broken or something so i go inside to tell the teller guy and he fixes it. so as im coming out i see that that guy has parked his van behind my car and is looking at me while talking on a cell phone. ok this is where i get freaked out. i finish pumping gas and get in my car and leave, and guess who follows me. i go all the way down sweetwater and he's still behind me. so then i turn into my friends subdivision and thankfully he keeps going.. that was very scary.. why do guys have to be such perverts?!  alright well i need to get dressed and eat something. frisbee today at 3 and then sara and i were talking about strip poker tonight?? call my cell, but im not sure if im going to be able to get out of the house. you guys are amazing and i'll talk to you later.  jess
