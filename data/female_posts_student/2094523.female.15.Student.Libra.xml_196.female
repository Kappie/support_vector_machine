Now you could have it all,  If you learned a little patience!  For though I cannot fly,  I'm not content to crawl!...  So give me a little credit,  Have in me a little faith!  I want to be with you forever,  If tommorow's not too late!...  But it's always too late when you've got nothing  So you say!...  But you should never let the sun set on tommorow,  Before the sun rises today...  IF I AM Another waste of everything you dreamed of,  I will let you down...  IF I AM  Only here to watch as you suffer,  I will let you down...
