Then again, guys in Japanese games are pretty nerdy as a rule, they would be taking that old Victorian "ooh! *blush*" role that women normally do, either that or they cain't speaka no English well good. But 'tis discrimination, what if I'm a homo or a sexist and I must play with a same sex character? I could be a heterophobe or something. That would be a good court case if it could be believably justified. But at this rate, I'm sure we'll be seeing plenty of studs in the near future.
