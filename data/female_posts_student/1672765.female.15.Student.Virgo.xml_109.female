Then we will be in the last, very last 6 weeks. Then Summer. Summer break.  Oh summer break how far away you seem to be.  Tomorrow in English we'll be watching a movie so that's something to look forward to. I actually don't mind school too much. I mean it seems to me you can either be unhappy or make the best of it. And why do so many people chose to be unhappy? It's not that hard to be okay with things, it takes practice and something needs to click but eventually it's easy and you'll be like me. Apathetic and lazy and indifferent.  Ha. Well it's better than it sounds, really. Because I do know what's important and I do it. I just think it's easier to be laid back and let things be then to get worried and frustrated and upset and angry. I've noticed I'm the only one who seems to think this way.  But hey, if people like being worried and frustrated and upset and angry then whatever.
