I was watching "AMericas' most wanted" and they were talking about the lady that is missing now, and how cops believe her husband killed her.  Sadly she was expecting a baby. They were planning on moving cause the husband was going to be doctor and finsih school there. Sadly that never happend (I sound like the guy from the stupid tv) The fact is, they think he killed her, and is going act like a looney. I guess he was working in one of those place where people go when they brake down.. man... What happend to the world? Why get married when all your going to do is kill them? What happend with deviorse... (I know i didn't spell that right but work with  me) i hate that also... but its better then killing someone, come on! Well i had to get that out. how much i hate that... Its stupid and my goodness... just stupid. Whats going on in the world that is making people crazy. Is it the water? Everyone blams water, i thought i would too...    Two: This is alittle more on my life and my best friends life. First off. I think i am a cold hearted person... heh. Trust me, y'all will agree. Whats going on with my bestest friend is; him and i have known each other for about 5 years. And in that time him and i have talked alot. I mean wow. And that hasn't changed. No matter who i date, or who he dates. (As for one of my entrys saying i lost him, i was just being silly, but said what i felt) Well he started dating about a year ago, and so far nothing good has come out of him dating. Other then knowing girls more then just as friends... I think... (THIS IS ALL WHAT I THINK IS GOING ON.. IF YOU WANT TO REALLY KNOW, TALK TO HIM!  just wanted to get that point arcoss) Well he started liking a girl... and they were going to wait. But something happend and they didn't... Now lets just stop right here. So i can put my imput in. She was waiting for someone else. This someone else and her were going to date. But he started dating someone else. I forget who. now at this same time, this girl and My best friend were talking... If my timing is wrong please tell me... anyways... so they dropped the whole waiting thing and started dating. Why? I have asked i think both of them that. And i think they just say cause we wanted to... As for my best friend i know that he REALLY wanted to. But her, i can't help but feel like she started dating my  best friend cause she couldn't have the other guy. but i wouldn't know. My feelings towards this: My best friend is just something that you can pick up cause you were let off... Now thats about the only thing right now that is bothering me, that i am going to tell... The fact is, she is still messing with his head even though they aren't together... This girl i care for, dont get me wrong! She is the nicest girl, and sweeties... But why? If you brake up with someone, dont act like your together still, dont tell him "well it might all change" Its a bunch of crap...I think she is doing this cause she doesn't want to hurt him, but she doesn't want to be with him... I have done that, but i dont know if thats what she is doing. I pray not. I dont know, i know its not my problem and i shouldn't be saying anything. And i know! But at what point to you say something when your best friend is being pushed around? Well i have told my best friend what i think. i hope i have... But her, she doesn't talk to anyone! But she does talk to Ryan and Eddie. And i know that. And thats great. But seeing how i dont know whats going on inside the relationship i have not right at all to say something to her... but man... This is just stupid...    Well about me. I'm just blah... I'm fighting with... myself. And i pray that the part that wants God more and more, doesn't lose to the part that is only on the right now... TTFN   I love you Rick! Naked kisses!
