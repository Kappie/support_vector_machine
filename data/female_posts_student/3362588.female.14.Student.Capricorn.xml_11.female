I dreamed that we were in McDonalds and in the next booth was Josh and Ethan who were talking to Robert and Ethan sounded exactly like Slug when Slug was making fun of Ashley.  It was totally weird.  And then one of them (I forget who) orded a chicken burger shapped like a face wit pickles for eyes and stuff.  I guess that all comes from evesdropping on Ashes and Josh's conversation yesterday.  hahaha.  It was fun.  Josh was all ticked that his stepdad wouldn't let him ride the predator, so robert and him were gonna ride it anyway hoping they wouldn't get caught.  That was right after Richie called for the 4th time and Ashes told him that she already had a boyfriend and his name is Josh.  hahaha.  So Ashes told Josh that they were now going out and Josh laughed.  It was really funny.  And then you could hear Robert in the background saying, "Who are you talking to?"  Josh: "Ashley"  Robert:  "Ashley Crim?"  "Ashley Kerr."  "uhhhhh..."  "I dunno, you might not know her."  "Ninth grade?"  "Yeah."  "Okay, I know her."  And then Josh says to Ashley, "He had to figure out what grade your in to know who you are."  And then he started laughing.  It was pretty funny.  And then Josh was all like, "yeah, Robert's a little weird sometimes."  and then Robert said something, so Josh says a little louder, "But I think he's cool.... Yeah, he's pretty cool."  Fun stuff.  And then Ashes called Slug and yelled at him.  And Slug got really ticked off at her.  And called Amy a lier and told his side of the story.  I still think da real story is somewhere in between.......  And then Richie called agian.  And, boy, was that the WEIRDEST conversation I have EVER heard.  He wanted her to record their conversation and stuff.  He kept telling her to stop and play and record and....  Strange stuff.  "Shut up, Russo." hahaha. *ahem*  Went swimming wit Leners and Jow-tow yesterday too.  Fun stuff.  Sandy Beach is SOOOOOOOOOO shallow this year!!!!!  You can walk from one end right to the other!!  I bet it's even too shallow to jump off the big rock!  So I'm ticked 'bout that.  Next year it's gonna be a big sand pit.  awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.    Darn, we have to clean today...... but we cleaned YESTERDAY!!!!!!!!!!!  But no, it's NOT GOOD ENOUGH!!!! *sob*  The agony!!  hmmmmmmmmmmm.... Notin' really mucho more to say.  There's a big party today at Spanish.  Thank God spanish is OVER!!  wooohooo!!  I hate Spanish.  So boring.  I'm so not a launguage person.  *Fake motherly voice*  "But you COULD be a language person, dear, you do so good!  Your the best in your class."  Yeah, well, that's not saying mucho grande.  I always get a headache during Spanish too. Prob 'cause of Will.  He is the most annoying, spoiled little kid I have ever met.  If I was HIS mom....... Anyway.
