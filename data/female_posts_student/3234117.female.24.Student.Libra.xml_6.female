I mean if I could choose to be happy in love or be single, I'd choose to be happy in love.  Wouldn't you? It's easy to say you want to be single when you are.  I mean what's the point to dig yourself into a hole or deep depression rather and tell yourself you hate being single, which you are? I don't know.    Plus I had a date Friday night so that put an end to my dateless nights.  I didn't last very long.  I don't know if it was really a date since he's been my friend for a long time, but my dad would classify it as a date.  It's a guy, we're going out, and he's paying for me.  This qualifies as a date to my dad.  And to me really.  Although he didn't just pay for three rounds of my drinks, he also paid for my two friend's three rounds of drinks as well.  Nice guy, huh?  Although he's a little too forward for me and well, I'm just not really attracted to him.  Neither were my friends.  Plus I should know you can't bring a guy to a bar unless it's your significant other and you like the guy.  Today I went out on the boat with my sister, her boyrfriend,  urlLink Chelsea , Perry, and Robert.  I had a great time and somehow we avoided the rain.  Chelsea and I also avoided serious injury or death while being dragged in an inner tube on the lake.  It's a little bit scary to be hanging on for my life and read Caution: This float could cause serious injury or death!  It turned out to be a lot of fun!  It's also great to make friends with people who own boats!  Mission accomplished!
