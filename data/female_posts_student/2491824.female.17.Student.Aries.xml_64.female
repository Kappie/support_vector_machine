Catch-22  is playing in Morgantown on March 4... ..From their website:  Thu. Mar 4 - Morgantown, WV @ 123 Pleasant Street w/ Big D and the Kids Table   Hehehe...    IF  I could drive... I'd so be there...  *snap*  I need to driiiiiiiive...  ....and it's on a school night....  ...pssssshhhh!...   I need to convince someone with a car to go...  :D  Whoopie...  NOTE: I just revisited the site and noticed that they are going to also be in DC at the 9:30 Club...on the 23rd... Sure, that's only about 80 minutes away and Mo-town is about 3 hours away... buuut still... it's in Mo-town...! ...and at 123 Pleasant Street... wheee!... ( The Argument  plays there a lot...
