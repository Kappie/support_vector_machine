Not my fault...Alexanders stupid. Anyways, as long as I get at least a %91 on my algebra scantron it won't be a problem. I guess we'll see. Ugh, we had the parade yesterday for marching band....boo for parades. My arms hurt soooo bad. Not cool. I invited Paul over for memorial day but he couldn't come so I ended up going to Emily's instead. Yeah we watched Return of the King. I can't believe I sat through that again. Gah. So yeah, I bought a homecoming dress on sunday. It was ridiculously cheap-$42. Originally $169. Sweet. And plus, its red and strapless. Its awesome. No marching band this week, yay! I can't wait till we get our show music and start the good stuff. Parades suck. Anyways, Paul has a surprise for me tomorrow. I have no idea what it is. Emily knows, and she said its something to do with music, but she wouldn't tell me anything else. I'm excited...I wonder what it could be....
