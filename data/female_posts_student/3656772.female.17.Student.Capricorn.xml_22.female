I'm at work right now...Ashley told us to go back to the Admin building, and she hasn't showed up...so we're just hanging out. Matt's playing on his new pretty lap top. 'Tis kewl. I've been learning a lot of interesting things about comps these days though, that and doing a lot of grunt work. We've moved over 250 computers by now *rolls her eyes* all over creation, too. Lol, Matt's sorta talking to himself, sorta not, so I never know when to answer. So I just kinda look at him to see if he looks at me for a response, lol, he's an odd one (like me, right?).   SOOO hopefully I'll be able to get my freaking license today, Dad's picking me up early today and we're going to go try to get it at one of two places. I still can't believe I lost my wallet, but it seems like I've been loosing everything these days, shezzz. So has everybody else too, I guess. I'd almost guess Mercury was in retro, but it's not...so I donno, maybe Smauss can ask her mum what she thinks. *Sigh* Well...we're getting paid to sit around I guess, cause I dont know where Ashley is.....Tony is going to beep her on the beepy-phone (nextel). Tony is kewl. He's nice and oh! He told me what a style sheet is!!! Yay-ness....so now I can hopefully figure out how to use it/ if I need to use it for next year's online journal thing.   Yep...   *nods*....    mhmmm.....   So I'm a little lost on what to do now... guess I'll just resort to holdthebutton.com again...lol.   Peace Out.
