I'm gonna miss that smartass but luckily she's coming back Sunday! yay!!! Lol At 2 I'm going to work to pick up my check and cash it. Today's my dad's birthday. He's getting old! Lmao. We're going to celebrate it tomorrow night since I've got work today and tomorrow 11:30am-4:30 *sigh*  Between This City Skyline  Your eyes followed me out the door, and your voice rang out on the edge of town. Between this city skyline I watched the sun die, swallowed up in the traffic. I left to die with the sun, to be forgotten. To fade away into the evening dew, into the shadows, and into the wind.  ^It's not much, but sometimes little things like that just need to be written down.  Like Burnt Paper  My world crumbled today like burnt paper. It had looked so solid-- frail, but like it could survive. And then I watched as, at my touch, it lost its shape and form and crumbled into cinders. And I just stared, as my charred world fell to ashes.  Lying on my bed of burnt laughter and dream-cinders, my face as ashen as my surroundings, I took a deep breath, (the air was all smokey) shakily stood up, and dusted myself off.  I whispered to the condemning silence, "I'll be okay. I can deal. I can cope."  I begun to walk away on unsteady feet with bitten lip and shadowed eye murmering again, "I can cope."  And, do you know, it was the oddest thing-- There wasn't a person in sight yet I heard a soft voice say, "No, you can't."  Startled, I replied through a mouthful of bitter ash, "Yes, I can! I can always cope!"  The only response was a quiet laugh and a hiss of, "No."  Angry now, I cried,  "I can cope!"   ...but the only reply was a laugh, almost kind.  With a sigh, I combed the ash of a cremated world out of my hair, and rinsed the ash out of my mouth and wiped the ash off of my face.  The silence continued to condemn.  And as I rubbed the last cinder off, I whispered hoarsely, "Do you know, I'm starting to get just a little bit tired of pretending that I can still cope."  I'm not sure what exactly made me write that, but I did and it's finished which is all that really matters, even if it sucks lol.  Much love
