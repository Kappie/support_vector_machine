It's not often that I sit down and think about the way I've been living life and think about how I could improve it. Tonight was one of those rare chances. The NHS induction: I may not be one for ceremony, but hearing about teachers talk about Mark's brother Ganesh and listening to Ganesh talk about himself inspire me to step back for a second and think about my own life. I almost think of it as a cycle. March, I was more withdrawn because of piano. April, I'm starting to lose balance again, having ventured more toward that other side.  At any rate, it's just the right time to reaffirm values. SATs and APs are coming up and I need to have results in mind and study diligently. I haven't been very nice to people--family, but maybe people in general--lately, and maybe I should just think about the way I act. Life right now is too much about what I want, and perhaps that's not the correct attitude now, or ever. I could seriously be less of a Nazi in journalism. I could cooperate in Anatomy. I could stop trying to be such a power-hungry individual and think of the group. Honestly, there's wonderful people out there, and sometimes I fail to see that. I need to be more open, more kind. I'm sure it'd be wise to balance fun in there, but I would like to reshape my character first.  As corny as it may sound, tonight (or as soon as I can) I'd like to resolve some things that have been bugging me.  Is it eventually all for the self? Maybe I haven't made full conversion yet, but it would certainly help me too if I helped others. Thinking to do.
