And no I don't have anyone to tell me how I should live for today and all that crap because I really don't care. I want guys to open doors for me, and here's a thought pay for me on dates. There would be home comings and soda shops. Not to mention there'd be awesome clothes. Clothes that look good and still have material. That's a concept people don't really understand today. Plus my kinda music was back then. I could go to concerts when they were young and not ugly. It's not as interesting seeing like reunion concerts with a bunch of old people pretending they're young. Chivalry wasn't dead then. People might have even said please and thank you then too. Veronica can agree with me on this one that most everyone in our school never knew the meanings of those words. I realize I'm grouping all things together here. I know everything in the past weren't good, and I know not all things suck right now. However, I still don't care. Too bad none of this will ever happen but hey a girl can dream can't she?
