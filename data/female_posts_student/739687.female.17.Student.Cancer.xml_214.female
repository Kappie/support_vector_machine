The first two notes sound beautiful and eloquent, but the last two sound clown-ish and mocking. It makes me wonder how a bird like that could ever be taken seriously. It makes a delightful first impression, but as you listen more intently, his song is ruined by his foolishness. When I first listened, I was so delighted by the first two notes that I mistook the 2nd two notes being played. I pictured the tune in my head that I wanted to hear, but as I listened closer...I heard that the third note was a sharp, shreeking noise, and that the fourth sounded horrible.  I've been thinking about that, and making a connection between that bird and people, in that people, like the bird's song, can be horribly deceiving. They make a cunning first impression, and from that people assume that their full character  must  reflect that delightfulness that they had first witnessed. And so they become blind to the flaws that consume the rest of who that person is. But sometimes you have to look a bit deeper, listen a bit close, to find out who they really are.  Think about that, crazies.
