Oh gezze never thought I'd say that. Well ehough with that, I'm gonna talk about driving! My first time out legaly. I almost rear ended a guy coming off of exit zero. It was great. My dad totally fliped out. Yeah then I was in the other people's lanes on thenth Ave. S. and I was going way under the speed limit. People hated me and I was yelling at the ideas of them. Since I am too nice to actually yell at them. What else should I talk about...nothing? Sure that works. I'm just fonna go. Yeah, bye.
