They both have biblical scriptures, which is about the only thing comforting to me during this tragic time.  I know that Brandi would want me to be studying for the GRE and not simply moping around, but I'm depressed to the point that I don't feel like doing much of anything.  I had Bible study for awhile, which helped quite a bit.   The doctors are saying that the tumor is more than likely malignant, because it's already spread into her temporal lobe area.  Not good.  I'm going to go try and eat something.
