NO. i'm evil. i'm malicious. yes. i want to be.  i want to be cold. and aren't i? i'm awful. if you could only see...i don't deserve anything. but i do better than others. no, i'm wrong to say that.. what am i saying...no i'm not. i know.... whatever tasnia.  it's just one of those nights where my life feels like the pieces don't fit together right. and there's something missing. and maybe there is something wrong with me.  i shouldn't even be talking about it. dammit. i'm ok. there's probably nothing wrong. it's just me. i'm paranoid.  paranoia. yes.  it's late.
