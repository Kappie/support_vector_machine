Across the street from my house there's a Jr. High and there having some day camp. So I wasn't too happy when I woke up. I really don't want to go to work today. I love my job, but I'm too lazy to get up and get dressed. And then I still have to drive over there. If you have a job, you know what I'm talking about! Don't lie. Oh for those of you who don't know what I do, I'm a Swim Instructor for the YMCA. Its a fun place to work, and I've made a lot of great friends working there, but sometimes you just don't want to get up. LOL. :) Some times you have kids that absolutely wont do anything. I always get at least one kid who is afraid of water. There taking swimming lessons, but they don't want to get in the water. The parents don't even think about it. They sign there kid up for a class because they want them to learn how to swim. But the kids won't get in the water. Parents fail to realize that the teacher cant make the kid swim. The kid has to want to learn, then I can teach them. I'm really not a mean person. (Angela, that's not a lie. LOL) I try to make my lessons fun for the kids, but if they don't listen to me then I have to act differently. Yesterday, I was having fun with my 6:00 o' clock class and there's this boy named Collin. Everything was ok. The usual, he wouldn't listen until I reminded him of the rules. Well after the 6th. Time I had to remind him, I was getting a little impatient. I had aleady sit Collin out, so I couldn't do that again. (because it wasn't working.) So I took Collin in my arms and carried him around the pool with me while all the other kids kicked on the kick boards. (luckily it was the end of class so I only had to do it for a min.) Collin didn't like that very much. So after class he started crying and ran to his parents. His parents saw the whole thing so I didn't get in trouble. When I went up to Collin to talk to him, I changed my tone of voice, so I talked normal instead of in my goofy little kid voice. Then I think Collin got scared so I had to try to make him feel better. After all me kids left, I went in the back room were all the employees hang out. I was talking to my friend Andrew and he says he knows why my kids don't like me. My kids like me, its just when I get mad they don't like me. Andrew says its cuz I change my tone of voice with them too quickly. Like when I was talking to Collin. I'm not going to have a talk with my kids in my goofy voice. That's for class. So Andrew says I shouldn't have my goofy voice/ attitude in class. That I should just be serious so the kids don't get that shook when I go and talk to them. What do you think? Lots of parent say I'm doing a really good job in class and that I'm great with kids. So who do I believe? The guy that's known me for a while and knows how I am? Or the parents who like how I teach my classes and there kids? Believe it or not, Being a Swim Instructor at the YMCA is hard. You always have to put on a happy face and nothing from out side of work can bother you when your in the water with your kids. You have to have a lot of patiace and sometimes I don't really have that. So kids I'm going to go. I'll write again tomorrow. Bye guys.
