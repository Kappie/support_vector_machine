I have never in my life had everything be fine. There's always been school, or friends, or body image, ornot-smart-or-special-enough get in the way. I don't really know what it'll be like, having everything under control. Totally weird, probably. I'msure jinxing my happiness by talking like this, but whatever. At least everything's good for now.   Today I was working with my dad and I saw this old newspaper article on the wall about my mom. It was from 1995, when I was, according to the article, '4'. Whatever, P. Journal. It came with color pictures of our old home. The whole thing was based on my mom's mission to fix up the dilapidated house we used to live in. It was so weird to see what the place I lived in used to look like. It was a triple-decker (a three-story apartment building for the architecturally-unaware) from the turn of the century, with peeling white paint and Victorian detail.You could see where porches used to extend off the front of the house, though the only evidence of them then was three strips of excess material on the house's front. The yard was overgrown with weeds.   Herewas my mom, not even 30, with two children under six, no husband, no job, and a huge house that was on the brink of demolition. Rooms were filled from floor to ceiling with debris that the last owner had collected. One room contained nothing but motorcycles. The only good thing in the entire place was the frame of the house. DCYF (The Department of Children Youth and Families) almost tookmy sister and I away.My mom recruited construction workers ('Dead Heads'; followers of the Grateful Dead), applied for grants, took every precaution with my sister and I, went over whoever's head she needed to, to do what had to be done.   Do you know how that house looks today? There are 4 fixed-up, beautiful, spacious apartments. The side lot was bought and turned into a parking lot and garden. The side of the house that used to be filled with poison ivy is now a mulch-ed path and semi-patio. It is clean and beautiful, with the original detail preserved. I will never be prouder of my mom than for what she did with that house. Now she's doing much the same with our new place, although not on as drastic a level. People like my grandparents scoff, but I trust her. I know she can do this.   My little brother Ian is sitting on the radiator behind me, eating a container of blueberries. He just kicked down the door to my sister's room. He's showing me a list he made that says "SLEEPOVER NETFLIX" in yellow highlighter. He's missing his two bottom front teeth. If I try, I can still carry him with a hip and one arm. He's hyper and shy and stubborn. Let me ask him for a quote.   POIRE: "Hey Ian, gimme a quote."  IAN: "Huh?"  POIRE: "Say something cool."  IAN: "Blah."   And then he laughed.   IAN: I mean not blah, not blah, change blah to..."   And then he went pffffft spittily (you know, where you stick out your tongue and blow). I love you, Ian.   And just for Henna...   "I saw fireworks from the freeway and behind closed eyes I cannot make them go away  Cause you were born on the fourth of july, freedom ring  now something on the surface it stings  that something on the surface it kind of makes me nervous who says that you deserve this  and what kind of god would serve this? We will cure this dirty old disease  if you've got the poison I've got the remedy   "the remedy is the experience. It is a dangerous liaison  I say the comedy is that its serious. Which is a strange enough new play on words  I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend the rest of your nights with the light on  So shine the light on all of your friends because it all amounts to nothing in the end.   "I won't worry my life away.  I won't worry my life away.   "I heard two men talking on the radio in a cross fire kind of new reality show  Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack  they were counting down the days to stab the brother in the be right back after this  the unavoidable kiss, where the minty fresh death breath is sure to outlast his catastrophe  dance with me, because if you've got the poison, I've got the remedy"   Ian knows the words to that song. That is so messed up. He's now singing the messed-up words to the Teletubbies theme that my mom taught him. "Stinky Pinky, Dipshit, Pee Pee, Poop..." Goodbye for now. I'm going to go throw an exercise ball at him.    Lyrics courtesy of  urlLink JasonMraz.com .
