Actually i was putting some stuff in the freezer, when suddenly my finger got stuck to the ceiling of the fridge. I pulled it but had to exert a lot of pressure to do that. It felt that i had delibrately put some super glue on my finger to stick it there.   Anyways, when i finally got it off, it hurt a bit but i didnt notice anything. But after a while it hurt a bit more. When i saw it, it had a small burnt-like wound on it, all pink and a bit swollen.   So thats how i got 'Burnt by Ice'. ;)
