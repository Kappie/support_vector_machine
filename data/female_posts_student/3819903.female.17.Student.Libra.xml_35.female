So my whole day kind of revolved around two things: My nose, and Hurricane Charley!  My Nose:  Well for a while, my nose has been funky; with allergies every-now-and-then, and today... it was extra retarded!  My right nostril (in case anyone cares) was stuffy, so I was breathing out of one nostril for the whole day... thats annoying as hell!  So the question crossed my mind a couple times if I had a cold, or was just having a ridiculous reaction to the ragweed!? I sure hope it is allergies, for more than one reason!  wink!   Hurricane Charley:  Well, if you have been watching the news the last two days, you would know about the powerful cyclone churning in the Gulf of Mexico.  Well, my grandma, who lives in Fort Myers, Florida, has been hunkered down in a Hurricane Shelter for the last 48 hours, and we have heard nothing from her since.  I know that sounds a little scary, but the one thing we're more worried about is her apartment, on the beach of Fort Myers.  See, Fort Myers was in the direct path of the eye of the storm; Thus, packing the strongest winds, and the heaviest storm surge--up to 18 feet!  We aren't concerned about her safety, because we know she's in a shelter that can withstand winds of 200 mph, but more her stuff on the beach front property!  The fact that the storm surge is possible of excessing 18 feet... that could completely submerge the whole apartment!  Therefore, ruining all of her furniture, appliances, and pictures.  The power generated Hurricane Hall, is holding 1500 people, that live in the Neighborhood... sounds a little packed to me?  I don't know about you, but I'd be going nuts!  But original plans were supposed to go as follows:  Brewer Game with the girls, Nicole, Amanda and Kate.  But due to my sinus problems that were making me crabby, and kleenex addicted, and the southern typhoon... I decided to cancel on my best friends, to relax, and let the stress of going, going, going, escape!  So, I did some laundry, to see how much laundry I could possibly take to Edgewood with me in 16 days.  Well, during that fiasco of cleaning the room, and actually doing the laundry... I was taking my pastel clothes out of the dryer, and I found a cap a of berry blistex, sitting on the lint catcher.  In my mind I'm freaking out... thinking...  Shit that better have just been a cap that accidentally gotten in there; the whole tube hopefully isn't in there!?  So, as I take out the clothes... I see this pink/greasy stain on my Marquette University Shirt.  So right now I am officially freaking out!  That this was my biggest load of laundry, with all my favorite clothes, and the possibility of all of them being covered with greasy, pink stains was making me sooo upset!  So I take them all out and go upstairs... where I immediately start balling!  All of my clothes, some of which were pretty expensive, others were sweatpants, and t-shirts, were spotted with the moisturizing lip balm!  I was having a "kiniption" as my mother would call it!  I was freaking out earlier about the cost of my textbooks, and now the fact that my clothes were ruined, left me with the thought of  oh my god, I'm not going to have any money to buy new clothes now! Cause all my clothes are RUINED!   So, I took one of my crummier shirts, and tried a grease remedy on it.  So, I took the SHOUT and rubbed it... and it came out!!!  So... for the next 2 and a half hours, I took all of my clothes downstairs to the laundry room, and made all of that lip blam disappear!   A little stressful... but I definitley got some well needed chores done!  But, tomorrow should be some what interesting!  I work with Nicole for 7.3 hours!  Man, spending that long with her at work makes it go so fast!  Because, as apposed to working with someone you dont really know, you work with your best friend, who you can laugh your ass off with for 7 hours, while listening to the radio, and eating chocolate!  (By far the only thing I'm gonna miss from that job--the free chocolate!)  But after our day inside, tending to sick peoples family members, we're gonna hang with all the buds, and have one grand ol' time!  Should be blog worthy!   But, Hey!  Off to bed!  I need to get up early again tomorrow morning!  Damn it!  I suppose I need to get a little used to it! OK, g'nite my fellow readers!
