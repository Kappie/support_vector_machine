It's lost, see, and I didn't tell Dad that it is, I told him that it's under my table every day of the week so I won't forget it every day I come to school. He says there'll be something for me if go home without my watch. Something bad, duh. So it's simple...Id on't go home. He said that I could skip Miss Jun'es class whenver necesesary so I'm skipping lah. I thought dah banyak dah skip so cannot skip agen tapi he said juz skip after interrupting me when I tried to explain dat dah banyak dah yang I skip. Pasal ah. NOt my problem. I'm like so damn fucking pissed lorh. Btw, nobody else knows bout this blog excpet for me coz I juz created it yesterday. And also because of the censored address. *smiles*   Oh fuck they're having a teacher's meeting now, right in the three adjoining classrooms to mine. I can hear the tecaher's voice but I can't hear what they're saying. Shit man...at least I've made some kind of improvement right??? I mean my Maths assignments used to be always late arh but now at least some of them are on time...but my tests...sighs again. THey assess us on our tests, projects, performance tasks, and even Service Learning and Leadership skills. Rp what. Can die, might as well be rip. Eh, RIp. Paul. Sigh. Wonder how he's doing at school. Must be doing great. All Chinese peeps do. Malays just often fail tests. In my case, always fail tests. I mean, WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH ME???  Last term it was homework, now it's test. Next term? Next next term??? Must be crap like leadership skills aren't there lah, attitude is wrong lah...and I wanna be an SL summor. Can go to hell. Bukan SL jer dah pressure dah...jadi SL mesti ada consistent grades. Me? Consistent?! Nak mampos keh?! Dah lah tak consistent...attitude pulak salah. Alahai. Sighs again. Benci ah skolah ni...smorang bago2s adalah orang ni yang asek fail jer. Tak pernah aku pass satu pun Maths test. Yang dapat tinggi-tinggit pun tak guna...cuma homework jer. Test sebab aku tak mug...tak beljar. Pertama kali I masuk skolah ni, PSL aku cakap passal fail banyak test arh abih I heard some other people brodding about thier chem test or whateva... ader jugak yang tak mahu pergi skolah ni lagi. Eh tak pasal2 pulak aku tulis Melayu?! Aper ni??? Sigh. Dah pukul 2.00 dah. Masih kat bilik darjahn ni sendirian.   Eh...Kak Fadz ader boyfren! Dari ri lagik. Danial nama dia. Diorang slal dok sama2. Ituari CIP tu kat Ri. Eheh flirting like hell man...but Kak Fadz is taller than Dani...I thought Dani quite short??? No izzit? Twitch. Takder ada bunyik jer tadi. Seram arh. No lah jj.
