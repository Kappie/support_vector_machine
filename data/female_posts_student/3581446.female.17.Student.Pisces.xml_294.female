Tsedey woke me up this mornin' (I know you're gonna read this, sweetie pie!) and she said she was gonna call me back and she neva did! I woke up fer nothin'. >.  I finally got out of bed at 1:30. Took a shower, got ready and headed for Asia's house. We went to Starbucks 'cause she had a buy one get one free coupon. Those are fun. Love those. I got a scarf from the cute little Jamaican store. The guy there was so friendly. Ate at subway. Went to the theatre. Watched Spiderman. Smiled at the lovely kids that made fun of the kissing scenes. I totally feel them, man. It was so nasty. Laughed at MJ 'cause she's such a dork. Felt bad because MJ reminds me of self. Nodded and agreed with all of Asia's comments on the movie. Walked home, parted ways...  Now, I am home chewing on a straw.
