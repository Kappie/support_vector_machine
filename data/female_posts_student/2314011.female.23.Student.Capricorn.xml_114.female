It's come to my attention that a certain someone seems to get nothing for her trouble in regularly reading, and now commenting on (The Platudinarian), this blog other than a miserable critique of grammar and spelling.  Most of my friends have received their own introductions here: some a bit edgy, others more touchy-feely; but she's only been mentioned in passing or in stories of funny moments in otherwise ordinary days.  Always one to jump on the remedy train, I thought I better do something about this issue, and right quick!  I mean really, here she is, taking a chance, reaching out at last, after much prodding and harassment and what does she get in return?  Well, she gets this; her very own introduction. Hope it's what she wanted.  She's the enigmatic one of our class.  Always has been.  The one everyone has a sneaking suspicion about, but few actually know.  She's just recently begun to come out from behind her shield.  And I think she's starting to like it.  I remember seeing a bit of that person around the shield the first few weeks of the school year and instantly wanting to know more.  She was so quiet and protective at school.  And, really, who can resist such a great mystery?  Once she found her comfort-level, though, she was incredibly open, honest and generous with herself.   She's the one thinking deep, profound thoughts and letting others spout off incessantly.  She's the one studying 14 hours a day and lets me get away with claiming I "carried" her through finals.  She sings along with a favorite song and wonders if she's shown too much of herself.  She begins linguistic trends in strangers' households without even trying, for Christ's sake!  She's more careful in showing off her bongo drums than in telling stories of life-changing experiences; it's easier to share who she was than who she is.  But she's starting to do just that more and more.  I hope she likes what she finds.    She used to "not engage"; now she's writing jokes in her class notes.    She's still hesitant to let anyone know how well she does or how hard she works; but she's working on finding ways to articulate those deep thoughts without too much exposure.  This is someone I hope to know forever and am grateful for each piece of herself she shares.
