I am thinking about food, trying to post things, checking my email... generally being overly distractable.  What to do, what to do... other then my 20 page paper.  It's my last one, the other two are in for better or worse.  I know that I will feel much better once it all gets done.  Once I can sit back and be at peace with my first semester, a sigh of relief... but I'm hungry, and tired and grumpy.  Damn it.  I was trying to post a photo to my profile, and failed utterly, but did get a picture of me in Washington up, so I suppose that will have to do.  I am so computer illiterate.  They never seem to say the things that I want them to in the directions.    I was laying in the sun a little bit ago, just feeling the burning on the thin strip of lower back where my shirt had ridden up.  I want to go to a movie, and sleep, and for it to be summer.  I think in a way though, and this happens to me every semester, I don't want it to end.  I want to be taking a summer course, or having a job, or doing something.  It never feels right, having all this stress build up and build up, and then gone.  I just want a week, or a month, and then back.  Don't send me away from these walls all hot long summer, all moist night cool evening summer.  I want to still be thinking and talking- I want to see how long I can push it, pry it, stretch it.  I want to see if the heat will turn my mind more malleable, more clay like, and I want to see if you can sculpt it into something it has never been before.  Thats it for now.  I just hadn't posted in a bit, and thought I ought to.  I put up another blog page at  urlLink www.bloggerresearch.blogspot.com   If you are interested in some of my academic writing on blogs, though not very academic as it goes, feel free to check it out.  I think that it turned out fairly well, and I had to learn how to link things, which is cool.  Deep breaths.  Almost there.  Okay.
