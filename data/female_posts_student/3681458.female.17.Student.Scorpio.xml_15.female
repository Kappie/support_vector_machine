My manager and coworkers laughed their asses off at Jennifer today. Apparently she thinks I'm not over Ben. Her IQ must be low. She can't be any more wrong. lol, I can't explain how over him I am. I hate him. He's ugly, queer, and incapable of acting his age. When I'm 18, my mommy won't be fighting my battles for me.   Today, I went out to eat with my grandmother at Olive Garden, and then we went to Victoria's Secret. It was fun, we found all kinds of cool stuff. Then, we went to Kohls. I found some stuff I wanted there. It was fun to hang out with her, and just keep her updated on everything that's going on. We talked about Ben, College, Jason... and the list goes on. =)  Alex from Nashville is here today. My sister went and picked him up. He's like 19, so he feels like an older brother. I like him. He's silly, but can always keep the mood light.  Jason wanted me to come over to his house tonight. He was going to cook me a spaghetti dinner. Heh. I never said if I would or wouldn't go. It feels too soon. He's a hopeless romantic, and I love it. Someone needs to sweep me off my feet for my attention. But, I didn't go... because it felt too soon, and I got invited to go have pizza with friends. So, I opted for the latter since I don't want to rush anything.   But this is all. I must go.
