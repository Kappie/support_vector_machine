So much that no one would recognize him.   Ok, that is a bit rude and disgusting. Plus, it would only make us republicans look worse, therefore accelerating the disappearance of our morals and views forever. If that were to happen, it seems that either the U.S.'s population would begin to dwindle because of more and more abortions, or it would dwindle because we are getting the crap kicked out of us by terrorists and no pansy democrats want to do anything about it.  Or it will dwindle because Micheal Moore made the nation more stupid everytime someone watched one of his disgustingly unrealistic films.   I can't wait to see what kind of shit he put on camera for this film. I bet Susan Surrandon and Tim Robbins will jump for joy. Woopie! We are celebrities who are now allowed to stick are fat asses in politics as if we know what was going on! yay!   I say give up Micheal Moore to the terrorists. Nobody cares if he's beheaded. It's better than innocent civilians that the terrorists have claimed.  *Go America* at least I love my country enough to fight for what is right.
