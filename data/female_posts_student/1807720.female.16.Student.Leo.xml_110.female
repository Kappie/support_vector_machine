I was reviewing my chem stuff and like I understand sooooo much stuff in the course now that I have like gone through everything we learned.  It's amazing!  I have a good feeling about the chem final because I really feel like I am REALLY REALLY REALLY getting this stuff.  of course ICE tables still continue to confuse me, but I partially understand them and well not understand the ICE table isn't exactly going to kill my mark.  I feel so good right now - but I am taking a little break right now because my brain will be fried if I don't take study breaks. feel so great and I am happy! :)  "Believe in yourself and you will succeed!"
