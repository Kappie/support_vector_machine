I'm caught in the middle.. I've bear the pain and gone to the "toughest" time in friendship.. Which almost gone case you see... Happy birthday to Hsiu Fen.. Though I didnt communicate with you.. Deep in my heart, you are always a special friend though you now didnt regard me as one cause of misunderstandings.. Actually today I intend to give up a surprise with a cake and go to your house.. However, as time passes by when I'm in school for band, my hope has slowly dashes as I think that, what will happen if you hate me even more... Pondering again and again just to know a answer.. At last, I didnt do it... I'm sorry.. I can only say this, I really dont know wazzup with you angry with me... I just felt left out all the while and that's why I decided to leave you guys.. Most probably, I still hates her.. Maybe as she enters and I got to be kicked out.. I really dont know.. Anyone can give me a answer? As time passes, I already 'si xin' le... I felt that I no longer treasured by anyone of you in 3E1... you guys just like to left me out and talk alot about results.. That's hurtful to me as I always the last in the class... Guess what, it's all my fault.. How I wish the sweet times together can be back again.. I know that, it's just daydreaming, that day wont come again... :'( Never mind, I already gave up as I cry and cry more last time.. Hmmm Slyvia, happy birthday to you too... hAha.. i rEmember sum of the ex-classmates birthday only! =P sorry~ hAix.. SOrriE.. I really cant make it...
