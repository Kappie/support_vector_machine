It's like you're always stuck in second gear    When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year, but       {Chorus}   I'll be there for you   When the rain starts to pour   I'll be there for you    Like I've been there before    I'll be there for you    'Cause you're there for me too       You're still in bed at ten and work began at eight    You've burned your breakfast so far, things are going great    Your mama warned you there'd be days like these    But she didn't tell you when the world has brought you down to your knees, and      {Chorus}       No one could ever know me   No one could ever see me    Since you're the only one who knows what it's like to be me    Someone to face the day with    Make it through all the best with    Someone who always laughs at    Even when I'm at my worst, I'm best with you   Yeah!      {Chorus}      I'll be there for you   I'll be there for you   I'll be there for you   'Cause you're there for me too     You may recognise the above as the theme song from the show "Friends". I told Eleanor that I'd mention her in my blog today, so I will: Eleanor is my friend. It's kind of a strange thing to write, but sometimes I don't know if people are really my friends or not ... but I know Eleanor is.  Aziz is back from Egypt you see, and she's doing her best to make me feel like a little lump of shit. I don't know if I'll be able to even really talk to Ella over the next few weeks. I mean, I understand right - they're friends, and Rebecca's just got back ... but I'm here too, remember? Rebecca doesn't like me, simple as that. It was all fine this year - I was even sort of getting along with her, but then she went all stupid (and she said horrible things about Fazz - she couldn't believe I liked him), and she said she was never speaking to me again. I didn't really care - it's not like we ever were friends in the first place ... but still - she just has to be friends with Ella and Lizz and Del.  I bet she's going to manipulate their minds and turn them against me. I've hardly even spoken to Ella since camp, and it's because almost every time I've seen her, she's speaking to Aziz, or trying to find Aziz so that she can speak to her. Yeah - so maybe I'm completely over-reacting and I'm a little jealous ... but I have good reason not to be in a good mood.  I'm not allowed to do 7 subjects next year. Mrs Gibbons said it would be good to do the extra maths (and she taught it this year - and I really need her as my maths teacher or I'll fail). But then Mrs Jolly said there was no way that the school would let me do 7 subjects. Yeah - I'm kinda DEVASTATED ... I really had my hopes up - I wanna be smart :(  Anyway, now I can't do general maths ... so I just have to pray that I get a decent teacher for methods.  Oh well, at least I'm doing 4 subjects the same as Ad√®le ... then there's more of a chance that we'll get into the same French class (PLEASE!!!!!!!).  I've got French next, actually. Yes - once again I'm wasting a web-authoring lesson typing a lovely blog entry. I might have to do my oral - stupid computer kept stuffing it all up. I'll be right ... it's a good one and I'm guaranteed an excellent mark (trust me, I know!).  Going to see farenheit 9/11 this afternoon, thanks to Mr K. (It's for People and Politics). I'm really not interested, but it comes out of our fees, whether we see it or not - so I may as well see it. Plus - we miss P.E!!! (Je deteste le sport).  The time is 18 minutes past 9. We still have 22 mins left of this class. 22 minutes of me typing random crap ... you're going to enjoy this !!!  Actually, I'm going to end this post here. I might start another one after I've posted this one ... but I don't know. We'll see ...
