With school and everything else going on I can barely remember my name much less when that crap is due....that's why I opted for them to send me notices in the first place...because I'm so forgetful. Bleh. So now I have to make a deposit towards my PayPal acct so I can pay it but that will take like 2 days (at least) to clear. :/
