"Where is that?" asked Margo.  "It's everywhere. I will be there after I walk home in two weeks", said Mitchell, I have lived in the same place for a long time, and it is time for me to go some place else.  "No," said Margo, "you have only lived next door for 15 years."  "16 years," said Mitchell.  "What's the difference," said Margo, "I want you to stay next door forever. "I can't,"  said Mitchell, "I will wake up in the same old bed and eat breakfast in the same old kitchen every room in my house is the same old room because I have been here too long."   "Do you look at me and think same old face, same old town, same old rocks, same old margo?"  "No," said Mitchell, "I like your face, I like you I like you I like you."  "I like you too," said Margo.
