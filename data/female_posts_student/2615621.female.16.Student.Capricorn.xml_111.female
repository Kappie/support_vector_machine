UGH so i talked to her for about 15mins. I told them all the stuff i was doing and made it sound as boring as possiable..well to glenn at least. hes upset cuz according to him hes not having any fun, and im having all the fun, and thats just not fair! lol We had a nice lil convo and i needed to call first of all cuz my grades were mailed to the house the other day...and if i was there i could at least see them before mom, and knowing her, she wouldnt have even asked for them. But nooo..she gets my grades first. So i called, and she said they were good, she couldnt remember all of them. but i was like *whew!* thats over. I told her i would call back for my classes next week when i know they've come in.   I was talkin to joe today about Danny. Well, that wasnt what we were talkin about first, i told him i wanted to get fake boobs. and he laughed. and then i said "naw, ive got enough boobs" and he said "yeah i wouldnt get boobs either, mine are too big" and  said "sooo joe, u have boobs now?!" wow!! haha and then i was like "so does danny have boobs cuz u know, thats not on the list" and joe said this...  Joe: yeah actually he wears a man bra because he broke his collar bone Me: seriously?! Joe: yeah, he broke it skating Me: he still skates right? Joe: yeah lol   okay..so maybe it was too good to be true...danny wears a freakin man bra. hahaha naw, i know what hes talkin about, and its just to support his back or whatever. oh well..that still wasnt on the list! BUT WHO CARES?! SKATING AND BREAKIN UR COLLARBONE AND THEN CONT. TO SKATE IS DEF. BADASS!! haha
