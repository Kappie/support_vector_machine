Hmmm...I was born here in Cali but my parents came here when they were in their early twenties and are the first generation in my family here in the U.S. from  urlLink Colombia .  My dad was born in  urlLink Barranquilla  and my mother was born in  urlLink Bogota, the capital of Colombia .  I have always been proud to be a colombian...even though I have never visited.  I'm sure there is much to it, that I just couldn't know about unless I went there and experienced it first hand.  I know one day I will go, but due to my current money situation,  it will probably be several years before I get the chance to go.  I have a few things which have been passed on to me through my parents...such as  urlLink arepas ,  urlLink vallenato , and a  urlLink sancocho  made by my abuelita.    Unfortunately, at this time in my life I am feeling quite disgusted with the  urlLink violence in Colombia .  I still have quite a bit of family there and recently....things have been  BAD .  About a year and a half ago one of my uncle's was murdered on his farm.   WHY ?  According to different stories I've heard it's either the paramilitaria or the guerillas there who decide that if you own a farm then you must give them lots of money so they don't kill you.  In the end, whether you pay them or not...you will probably get killed.  Now...I'm bringing this up because on this previous Sunday night, February 8th...I was informed that my aunt was also killed.  OMFG!!!  What the hell is wrong with these heartless killers ????  This is the wife of my uncle who was killed about 1 year ago...OMFG !!!  They have 4 children...my cousins.  This whole situation infuriates me....WHY is this being allowed ??  I hate this.  At this time, I pray that my cousins are safe and I pray that god is with them as they need him now more than ever.    Then this makes me realize something else...here I am in the U.S....and I've grown up around a bunch of spoiled kids who "hate" their parents...basically because the children take their parents and lives for granted.  We're so lucky to be here and not have to deal with many of the problems that third-world countries have to deal with.   All of this made me realize how quickly a life can be taken...sometimes you forget that life is so fragile.  I've decided that I will try my very best to not take my family and friends for granted...because in a quick second.... everything  can change.
