At first I couldnt stop crying. When I called him in the morning to talk to him and his mother told me what had happened. I didnt stop crying...even screaming. Although, I dont know what I was crying for. If I was crying because of how much I missed him, what my life was now, or if I was feeling sorry for myself. At first I think I was feeling sorry for myself, but now I realize that I dont need to. Feeling sorry for myself has no use...I am nothing. There is no me to feel sorry for. I haven't a life any longer. My day began and ended with his voice, and the thought of him. Every inch of my house he's walked through, and pictures cover my wall and my computer. There is no way of escaping. I've thought about killing myself. I've thought of many ways to stop myself from breathing. Although, now I'm just looking for better ways to cope. I dont see myself ever being with another person, there is nobody that could ever even begin to take his place, nor love me the way he did. Every movie I watch, every song that I listen to, he's in it. I still cry, although now I cry because I miss him..but I also cry because I'm so thankful that I got to spend the time that I did with him. Although, I still have many many many years of my life to live..without him, in lonliness. I may end up going..I may decide to stay. Either way, I'm alone. Forever.    *none of this is true..but Bill and I are going through our own little therapy, and I need to change. I'm going to do this a lot..to tell myself how much he really means to me. Although, if this were really to happen..I dont think I'd even give suicide a second thought before giving in. I hardly doubt that I'd write in my blog either..I'd have no purpose. I dont really have a purpose now either, but..William told me to do it..so I did. He doesn't know that I did it though...Goodbye for now*
