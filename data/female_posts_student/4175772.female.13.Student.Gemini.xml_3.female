One hour of my life thrown down the crapper, as my mom would say.  Otherwise I watched the Olympics.  USA won their first beach volleyball match.  U-S-A!  U-S-A!  *watches as Frenchies throw tomatoes at her*  Iraq won their soccer game today.  So nice to see FREE Iraqis playing sports along with Afganistan women.  This moment of wonderful history brought to you by the United States. *ducks more tomatoes from liberals and anti-war protesters* Gah.  Screw the liberals.  Frank: "Sir, is the officers latrine really destroyed?" Henry (mocking): "Is the officers latrine really destroyed?" Hawkeye: "Gone with the wind, Frank!"
