We turned and walked away Like strangers whom will always pass by I thought it would be a dream Which you would wake me up again. (How wrong I was)  Chorus The things that you gave were memories The things that you said were fantasies The things that you did were histories So I'll all write them down into a song like this The things that we owned were remembrance The things that we shared were happiness The things that we loved were still there(never changing, not changing)  You told me to forget this love Where you said I should find a new Though you're not the first But you taught me to follow my heart (do u remember)  Chorus The things that you gave were memories The things that you said were fantasies The things that you did were histories So I'll all write them down into a song like this The things that we owned were remembrance The things that we shared were happiness The things that we loved were still there(never changing,always there)  Bridge I understand that things may be difficult Someday I'll soon get over you But before you're actually leaving I just want to say that I love you. (I still do)   The things that you gave were memories The things that you said were fantasies The things that you did were histories So I'll all write them down into a song like this The things that we owned were remembrance The things that we shared were happiness The things that we loved were still there  Boy I wish that kiss would someday fade I just want to say that I still love you.                                 -*-   -*-  -*- COPYRIGHT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED @JOANNE WANG SHIYUAN
