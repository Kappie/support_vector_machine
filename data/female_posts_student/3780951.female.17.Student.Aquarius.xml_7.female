Tonite was a lot of fun. After the movies Johnny and I went to Toys R Us. OH WHAT FUN! i love acting like a kid. it brings back great memories. AHHHHHHH. Then we went to have supper with the parental unit at Capri's. that was, for lack of a better word, interesting! we ended the nite going to HollyWood video and walkin up and down all the isle's naming our fav. movie. then we venntured over to Blockbuster and did the same. It was a great nite. Had lots of fun and laughs! Tomorrow nite at baptism should be even more fun!! YAY for God!  love you all!  - anna g -
