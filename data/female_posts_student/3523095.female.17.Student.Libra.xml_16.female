Something out of the norm. when I wanted to go to the changing rooms to change…I took the route from the tutorial rooms to the track area….and I passed something….from the corner of my eye, I saw something familiar. Beautiful, familiar handwriting in orange….something that I had been looking at. I clutched my file closer to me and strained my eyes to see what was written…I couldn’t help but tear up…then, I was forcefully pulled away from the noticeboard….  break…was unconsciously looking for someone…saw the gang of pple…but no special someone…no canoe girl….no appetite..  geog lecture…again…was looking for the creature wearing blue tinted glasses…no cookie…then It dawned upon me. She’s already gone…did badly in the stupid quiz…c’mon…..who cares what china did for their one child policy? Not me….  Tried doing the Mt compo…still haven’t finish.  And by the way…..i think I am possessive….OVERpossessive at that. me aware that it aint good. But cant help it. It hurts. Painful leh…to see….or let someone slip by..guess it’s a part of life..i have to accept as I grw up….  But I don’t wanna grw up…..ever….its nicer this way…the innocence….joy…love…carefree...everything seems nice…  Sigh…time cant stand still…wish it did…then can rewind back…  Bubbyee.
