And if not, they are welcome to place a blindfold over their eyes.               Wait! Better idea....  Hmmm? You wanted to know what it was? Opps, sorry.. not going to tell you. I find that the air of mystery is much more alluring than the air of frankness. Of course, all the air in muskegon stinks because of the papermill.  So hold your nose.
