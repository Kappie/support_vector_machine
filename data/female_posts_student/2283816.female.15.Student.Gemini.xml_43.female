Okay. Now. Down to the serious junk.  Ever notice how teenagers are always philosphizing about the world and heaven and everything? And adults really aren't? I wonder about that.   I actually try not to think about it too much, because I would go crazy if I did. But here's some stuff I've thought of...  Maybe the afterlife is only what we imagine it to be. Maybe everyone has their own personal vision of heaven, purgatory, and hell, and God just is sure to punish/reward you with whatever it is. But I doubt it, because if we went to Homer Simpson's vision of hell, we would be surrounded by fire and eating barbecue.   But my vision of hell is a small white room, with no doors or windows, and yourself in incredible pain, searching around the box for a way out, with nothing else to do except sit and think about what gotyou there. And then you wouldstay that way for eternity. Eternity's a frickin long time. It's not even a time, it's just ...   Thinking about forever has always freaked me out. Or it did, until something occured to me. I don't care how long forever is as long as I'm not alone with just a bunch of angels. I want the people I care about to be there. I want to meet all the people I admire and new people I've never met, and I never want to run out of things to do. I don't want to just float forever.  But maybe that'll change once I'm actually there, you know? Cause supposedly when you're there, material things don't matter anymore. But I know my immature mind will still want to meet Anne Frank and Agatha Christie and several other cool people. And I'll still want to look at what's going on down there, just in case I leave somebody behind. I want to somehow help the world when I'm up there.   Purgatory is a weird thing. It's never been made very clear to me exactly what it IS. I have a couple of ideas, the first one being becoming a spirit on earth. You get the opportunity to correct something on earth that you did wrong while you were alive. Or if you can't correct whatever it was, you get to interfere with fate a little for the positive. Once you've done your job, you leave.   The second one is that you come back as a different person. I have extreme doubts about this one. But in some way, I think every action affects everything else (think butterfly effect), and in that lifetime you could repair what you'd done before. I don't know, I like the so-called ghost idea better....   Because really, what else could it be? An emerald mine somewhere in the underground where you hack away at rock with a hammer and feel like your soul's being ripped out, with a clock in the corner somewhere telling you how much longer you're going to be there?  If you want a really funny and moving book on this whole heaven/hell/purgatory thing, I recommend  The Wish List  by Eoin Colfer, the writer of  Artemis Fowl .   *sigh*....  In other news, I went bowling today, sucked, and then went to Healthkick to taste my first Bawls. It's strange and unique. I actually think I like Jones better. And I'm pretty sure I'm building up an immunity to caffeine, but it got me hyper nonetheless. I was tapdancing outside the bowling alley if that gives you an idea.
