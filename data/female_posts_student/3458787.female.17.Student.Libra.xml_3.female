LOL Most Singaporeans do not "admit" their patriotism to Singapore but come on all you Singaporeans out there I'm sure deep down in your heart somewhere there is a special place for Singapore.  Singapore is actually interesting I should say although most would classify it boring. I which other country do you have a big green dustbin every 10 metres you walk down the street? In which other country can you get from one end of the country to another in less than an hour? Where else will you see such long queues at McDonald's to get a free toy? In Singapore and nowhere else...   FOOD!!! You can get everything and anything here- no questions asked. I need not say anymore do I? LOL  And best of all Singapore is where I made my BEST of best friends and will enjoy the BEST of best years..
