We ran around pouring the soap on top of each other. It was like a guys fantasy. To top it all off we were turning each others hot water off so all we had was cold. can u say we were "nipply" as this guy said at the pool.It was total fun though. I have way too much fun with my friends doing pointless shit. Can u blame me though????    This summer is going to be the best yet. I kind've want to get a job but my mom says im too  young. I am going to practice my sprints like atleast 3 times a week  {I hope } and im going to set a personal most times at 6 flags record. {which i got to ay is only like 3 times but im gonna do it more this year. We always get season passes. ne ways thats all for a sec i might write more later.
