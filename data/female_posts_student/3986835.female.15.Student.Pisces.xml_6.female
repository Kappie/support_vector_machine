But I'm very near-sighted, so I had to get glasses (which is something I already knew, but my old ones were broken). So my mom and I went to the mall and I picked out these cute frames and gave them my perscription, and I had to pick up my glasses at 5:00. It was only 2:45, so my mom and I drove to a small town outside of Huntsville to look for new curtains for our living room and wedding rings. They're supposed to get married today but...we'll see. They're going J.O.P., so they can just wake up one morning and say, "Let's get married today!" That's the beauty of that. She brought up a very good point though. Any time anyone in our family has a big wedding, they end up getting divorced. It's our family curse. Okay, so anyway, we were shopping for rings and I was looking at guitars when Arnold calls and says that Ty, my sister, has a fever of 102.3 or something. So he picked her up from daycare and we met him at the hospital. After that, we went grocery shopping, and my mommy bought me doughnuts cuz she starved me all day. We came home, I helped her cook, I cleaned by bathroom, showered, ate, helped clean the kitchen, got on the internet, e-mailed Steve, IMed Lauren and Shawn, e-mailed Sergio, then I went to bed. And I actually slept four hours straight for a change! I didn't go back to sleep after that, but I've never slept four hours straight without waking up or anything, so I was pretty tired. Then my mom decided she was gonna let me sleep in, so she didn't force me to go back to the hospital with her. So I slept some more, and then Xavier called me at 9:00 am. I didn't answer the phone because there was no point. When we're on the phone, he talks to everyone around him but me. And, I'm sorry, but that's just a waste of freakin' phone minutes. My mom says it's cuz he's nervous, but I really don't care. Don't call me unless you have something to say to ME. Do I come off as bitchy and conceited? Cuz I hear it from people all the time, but I've never noticed it until I read what I think (if that makes any sense...). I don't mean to. Well, I'm gonna go shower and get dressed. And MAYBE call Xavier back. Maybe. I'll probably type later.          Song of the Moment-"She Will Be Loved"-Maroon5     Why?- I dunno, just cuz Maroon5 is an awsome bandand I love all of their songs.
