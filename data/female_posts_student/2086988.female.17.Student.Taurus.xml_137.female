So I got a total of about 1-2 hours of sleep. In which at 7am I just took some vicodin and the pain ceased somewhat leaving me knocked out til' 1. At least I go to the orthopedic surgeon tomorrow, maybe he can hit me up with something better that actually takes away ALL the pain and doesn't knock me out :/   She lives a life she didn't choose And it hurts like brand-new shoes
