I am not sure what it has to do with the movie but I suspect it relates to the cliche about trying to ignore the elephant in the room.  Fitting title in my opinion.  It was about a typical high school day and the typical kids who go there.  There was the jock and his girlfriend.  The three bulimic popular girls.  The artsy photographer.  The nerdy misfit.  The crowd drifter whose dad is a drunk.  And the two outcasts with a few things to hide.  This typical day turned out to be pretty abnormal.  All but one of them are killed in a massacre and I am sorry if I ruined the movie...you should still see it, trust me.  Yes, this is another one of those school shooting movies but it should not be compared to the other ones.  It doesn't deserve that sort of degradation.  While the other movies try to pin a cause as to why it happened, this movie just shows what happens.  You decide ultimately what the motivations were or were not.  This movie proves that you will never know a person for who they really are.  Everyone has a secret, some are bigger than others.  Everyone has the potential to do great things as well as the potential to do great destruction.  It is all a matter of what you as an individual choose to do.  What you choose to hold against people.  How you choose to express yourself.  What you embrace and what you push away.  And who you choose to love and hate.  There is no greater influence on a person's life than their own decisions.  It doesn't matter if you grow up in a loving household with both parents or if you have lived in 15 foster homes.  Anything can happen and anything is possible.  Good or bad, right or wrong.  You can do great things or do great destruction.  It is always your own decision and no one else has the responsibility or obligation to make it for you.  And there is no playing the blame game once you have made it.  You made the choice now follow through and accept all consequences.
