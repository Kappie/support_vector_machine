Somehow it just flew by and schools back in session tomorrow, **Sigh**.  Lately I've been feeling like everything in my life is just flying past at light speed and I'm standing in the center of it, not moving, just standing.  It's a very, very discouraging feeling to say the least.  Someday I will be a writer, though I am an impatient sort.  I want to be a writer, not an aspiring writer.  Still I have a lot to learn.  My grammar is terrible, and I am really benefiting from the college education I am getting just now.  Still, my impatience gets me down.  I don't want to be in college, I want to be done, and had I not procrastinated until now, I would be!  Such is life...  Still on a more pleasant note, Matt and I will not be moving until next year at least!  Three chears!  I really like where we are and so, we stay for a while longer.    I suppose that's an end to my rambling...  ~Kristyn
