Felt really good to sleep in; think this is as refreshed as I've felt in the last week or so.  Yay.  Remember that Property practice exam I was talking about forever ago?  Yea, think I might actually get to it today.  Not sure what else, though.  Might just be a nice, lazy, relaxed but still getting things done/studied day.  Those can be fun.  Maybe spend some time with the new book later, I dunno!  Hope I don't get bogged down in re-learning everything about the Discovery Rule or the three types of interpretation concerning the Hostility requirement for Adverse Possession.  That's right!  I said Adverse Possession!  It's still around!  So the Property final will consist of two questions.  The first will be a series of land grants (remember that other post with all that giving to letters of the alphabet?) after which we'll be required to give the state of the title.  The second will be to write a judicial opinion ruling on a set of given facts.  Imagine the professor will pack as much as he possibly can into those facts so we'll have to juggle everything we've learned this semester.  We've got four hours, though, so it should be entirely do-able.  My comfort level seems to be rising in the days before each exam, just as my celebratory mood seems to be rising in the hours following each exam.  Hmmm.  Hope I'm not setting myself for terrible failure and disappointment.    So the Grandparents are moving out of their house for good this weekend.  They just might have spent their first night in the tiny new house last night.  Got the official word from Mom last weekend that we're having Christmas dinner at our house.  This will be the first time in history it hasn't been at Grandma's.  And she's not even going to be up in our kitchen, making anything.  She's actually going to let Mom take care of it!  Can you imagine?  Mom's worried her stuffing will turn out to be soup, but I've forbidden her from using Stove Top, so we'll see how it goes.  We may be asking Grandma to help out next year.    Got a birthday in two weeks.  I'm always so shocked when I finally do the math and discover it's almost my birthday.  Just remember being a kid and starting the countdown right after Halloween.  By the time it finally arrived, it didn't even matter because I was so sick of waiting for it.  Have to say, though, I've always enjoyed not having to face the day-after-Christmas let-down.  How do you follow a day like that, really?  Having a birthday works, oddly enough.  And it works every time.  Last year's was a bit rough, though.  Stupid passports, anyway.  Very excited for this year's.  Gonna have a great gay (but not too gay!) time with the boyfriend and whoever else we can scrape together.  And we won't stop until it's 2004!    Or 2030!!
