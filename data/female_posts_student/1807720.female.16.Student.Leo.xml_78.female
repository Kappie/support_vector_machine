Arguing off and on about stupid stuff.  And ARGGGGG she was like "here have a muffin and shut up" and I was like "uh no, why the hell did you have to go and buy muffins anyway" and then like I was gonna eat and she was like "dinner is not ready" and she was like "have on of these" and it was a stupid packaged dinner.  she DOESN'T understand that those ARE NOT in anyways healthy and I told her that I would not eat something that nasty.  And then she was like "well then what the fuck do you want" and ARRGGGGG I can't fuckin take any damn fucking thing right now.  Stupid chem, stupid arguments, stupid everything.  I went onto the ucourses site during social and looked up my chem marks and there was my quiz mark - a 48% a stupid 48%.  A 48 for what...for working my ass off to understand, for trying SOOOOOOOOO damn hard, for trying to actually pass chem.  It is not fair, I hate it.  All my wasted effort and time and for what - a stupid fail mark.  It makes me want to just burst into tears but I haven't have the full out explosion yet, though I am thinking it might come sometime later in the week.  The chem teacher does not understand.  She doesn't understand that the stuff if REALLY HARD for me, I can't help it!!!!!!!   I feel like it is all my fault, like I am stupid or something but obviously that is not the case.  I want to know why everything is so damn hard.  I still wonder if this is normal for people, I mean of course not everyone will understand everything always but I am SO DAMN SICK OF IT.  I am NEVER good at anything, NEVER!  Not when I young, not now when I am older...plain and simple nothing has even been easy.  And you would think I would be used to it all by now but things get harder - way harded and defenetely not easier.  I wish I had answers for things but there are no answers right now, there is just feelings.  These feelings of anger, frustration, and yeah I do feel upset.  I didn't even think I did that bad on the chem quiz - I did all the questions and really put effort it.  How come a stupid 45%...HOW COME????????  What the fuck did I ever do to deserve to be doing to bad in chem.  Oh God it kills me to think that maybe I should give up my dream of ever being a science teacher, and tears come to my eyes.  But what do I do..I don't know what else to do about everything??  I just don't know.  I am so confused and have just about every damn problem in the world right now.  I don't want to say it and I don't want to believe it but I just want to be dead right now.  So much right now actually.  I can't take all this, this life - I still don't know what I am good at and there is nothing that I really excel at.  Other people have their looks, their grades, their talents but what I do have.  I don't know the answer to that, I don't know the damn answer to anything right now.  No one understands how it feels, they just don't understand, and would not be able to understand.
