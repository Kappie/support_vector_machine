I worked until 1:00 and went shopping ang other random stuff with my mother, which means I finally got my digital camera! Woot Woot! I am going to crem thinking about it. Then Ashley and I met up around 5:30, chilled here for a while then off to some stores.   WE still had a long as time before we went to our movie so we just cruised 'the strip.' haha yeah. Then we saw Kyle and Jordan and they were racing us and I lost, damn stick shift. Then trying to regain my car's reputation at the next stop light I attempted to kick their ass. However, when I jumped over into the next lane because the car in front of me was going very slow, I didn't see that car, then almost got me and Ashley killed. I did however keep us alive, we only drove away with being flipped off.   Then we saw Mean Girls. Good movie, a little extreme however. Then we came back to my house, goofed around with our cameras. She has me making cow and sheep noises recorded. Haha amusing times. But we were laughing so hard my cheeks almost still hurts. :)   We fell asleep around 11:30-11:45  and I woke up at 9:30. She was already awake getting ready for church. We then realized it was raining, so I crawled out of bed and drove her there so she wouldn't have to walk. What a nice friend am I hey?  I am up much earlier than I would like to be, I wish I would have slept until like noon at least. lol. Well I guess thats it for now.
