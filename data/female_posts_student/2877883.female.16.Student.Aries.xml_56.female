I am not one of those girls who does not have major self confidence issues and but still says "I'm fat" all the time.  Because I  do  have self confidence issues, but  don't  say "I'm fat" all the time.  But it is how I feel.  And I know it's true, hence the whole shorts comment.  I'm trying to fix this whole situation, it's not working so well.    I think the worst part is that I know what it feels like to not feel so fat and to have self confidence  Because I did, once.  For about a month.  Or a day.
