I haven't been feeling quite myself lately, for example, at night, I start to get these stomach aches and when I stand up I get this rush of dizziness and for a while my vision dots black. It's getting more annoying than anything else and I think I'd like to complain to the manager. Not like the manager ever really does anything anyway besides sit there and look at you while you make a total fool of yourself. I wouldn't want to be a manager of a store or anything. People are too damn whiny and I can't handle them. I'd just as soon slap them as soon as they open their mouth then send them away with some nice door prizes. Two hours until noon, Yay, and here I sit, in my pajamas with dirty hair and no makeup..I'm such a lazy bastard. LOL But it's a Sunday! My mom and Dad just left for the Airport. My dad is going to Detroit for a whole week!! SCORE!!! Now I'll REALLY have the house to myself ALL WEEK LONG....*falls over* I never thought it possible! Of course, my mom does get home @ 3:30 so I'm afraid wild parties are out of the question..*sigh* I went to a party @ a friend's house last night. It was hilarious!! First, we got there and jumped into his truck and he took us for a really fun ride down the road! One of his friends was sitting on the hood and he crawled up over the cab of the truck and down into the back with us. Daredevils. Then we played this fantastic new game they invented called 'Barnball'. Basically, barnball is basketball in a barn with no rules..Since the guys were all down in another building on the property, the girls all got the basketballs and had a rough game of barnball. Well, two of the guys came in and played with us before we took a permenant break. It was a good excuse to whip Emily around. We knocked each other over, pushed each other into walls, I ripped two holes in my pants and got a bloody and fat lip. Yeah, let's see the guys top that. lol Oh...and I talked to Jessie yesterday whose seen Ben (it's funny, it's like I'm researching Big Foot and I've just found my key witness to his existence..0_o)and she said he asked about me..hehehe..*blush* Yeah, little things like that make me happy..Pathetic, right? Oh well...
