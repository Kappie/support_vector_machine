It took me forever to roll out of bed and get in the mood to start getting ready for my day.  Algebra was yucky as was Lit and Comp.  During reading period I spaced out.  I was reading the edge and it brought back the memory of Kurt asking me if I was going to throw it down.  If you could have seen my thought bubble this is what it would have said, "...throwing it down, aka moshing aka a bunch of sweaty boys bouncing around and hitting each other.  Moshing does look fun but I think I'll stay a spectator because as Kurt said, he could never see me hitting somebody just for the fun of it."...end of thought (the bell rang)  Lunch was okay, weird red headed/chubby lunch lady gave me food today so I was happy.  Chem was dumb cuz we didn't do anything and in Physics we went to the computer lab.  I asked Shea if he would come in after school to take his picture again (they got deleted again...I know! (very angry face!))  He said he would and then some how it became a classroom discussion about same sex marriages.  Newspaper was productive today.  I got most of the pics in (the ones we had to retake) but I still have to go in tomorrow which I'm not happy about but at least I don't have to go in as early anymore.  Now as I review my day in my head I must have sounded really bitchy to Kurt, complaining about newspaper.  But it's just that I was so frustrated and annoyed with people being so inconsiderate.  So, if I was bitchy today, I'm sorry, I'm normally not that way, I guess everything just got to me.   I didn't do anything tonight b/c my parents think I'm always gone so I stayed home...not that I had plans anyway.  I think I'm supposed to do something with Megan tomorrow but I'm not sure because she said something on Monday and hasn't mentioned it since so I'm sorta out of the loop I guess.    ~Kay
