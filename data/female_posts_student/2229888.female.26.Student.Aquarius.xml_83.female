MOMENTS! Sky does not let me sleep. He is not happy when i have my eyes closed, and he's glad to pull himself up  BY ME OWN PRAY-SHUS HAIR! (everybody say OWWW!!! okay. that's enough.)  so i decided i would go with kimmie afterall since sleep wasn't available to me. what else would i do anyway? Stare at the walls until 2 o'clock?   the day turned out alright. I saw a bunch of interesting faces. One old lady on the bus reminded me of Granny. She looked like her. ( a bit darker as she was black) and she acted like her (you're not doing that right, honey!) it was surreal.     kimmie only got to see her precious teddy bear for 45 mins, tho.... that sux...   sky was cool... slept a little and charmed everyone in sight... nothign new there!
