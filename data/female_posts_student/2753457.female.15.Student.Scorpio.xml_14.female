It probably wouldn't process much anyway. What really sucks is that they are probably not going to announce a damned thing about the weather and delays and crap until tomorrow.  Watch me show up at school at 7:30 and no one's there.  Ughhhh. Eww, my mouth still tastes like ravioli. Today is Ellen and Mary's 21st birthday.  Every time I wrote today's date on my papers, I thought, awwwww, February 11th.  I cannot even believe that they are that old.  That is unreal to me.  I remember my first day of third grade, when we dropped them off at Enloe for their first day of freshman year.  I remember how old they seemed to me then, to be going to a big scary place with people smoking on the street.  Sigh.  And now they're away and legal drinking age.  15 doesn't seem old anymore.  Ellen and Mary have always seemed older and wiser, because they've always been there.  But the age gap fills now, and 6 years is not very long.  But this is getting way too sentimental. Ok, what does it take to get some good sheet music around here??  Musicnotes.com used to feed me good things, but now it just spits out old big-note digital crap, for stuff like the melody to the Spongebob Squarepants themesong.  That does me so much good.  Most of the stuff I want is obscure little songs, but most of what they have is bubblegum pop music.  Occasionally they'll surprise me with something like "Hey ya."  Not meant to be played on the piano. Ohhhh, my God.  I have to get something done tonight.  Who knows what will happen tomorrow, besides ample excuses to put things off further.  My mother always says that I should stop procrastinating because every time I do it, it deteriorates a little peace of me.  That's the way I used to feel when I'd have to pour my heart and soul into doing everything at the last minute.  But lately, I've just been BSing it anyway at the last minute.  I'm getting realllllly bad about this.
