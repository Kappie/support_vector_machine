Min, if ure reading this..i know what ure going to say..MANJA) sorryla i cant help it..      anyways..today..quite eventful day..i think. college was really hot today..something wrong with the stupid air conditioner. seriously...for the amount we pay them, i expect them to provide us students with better facilities..not aircon that bakes or freezes us at times. and yes, i had two practical exams today..chemistry and biology..chemistry was fine..bio was kinda fun...we got to make "sushi"..the experiment was regarding how salinity affects the rate of germination of seeds...so we rolled 6 green beans inside a damp kitchen towel to make a kitchen towel "stick", like making sushi..ha..      and physics, was as boring as usual..as boring as my blog, u can say..   that's all for now..i am currently suffering from writers block..and emotional distress...   bai bai
