       
      Been having a bit of over-extension stress the last few days, but a nice, long, brisk walk around campus putting up fliers for a lecture next week I know very little about (which may not be the best way to begin an administration, but what the hell?) with the Prez makes the mountain of tasks waiting back at my desk seem entirely more do-able and perhaps a bit pleasurable.    Beers and jazz at Pullman's intellectual bar is still in the running, but have a few hours to get through before anything's known for sure.    Back to work...
