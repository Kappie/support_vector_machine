Am I still your charm, or am I just bad luck. Are we getting closer, or are we just getting more lost.  I'll show you mine  if you show me yours first. lets compare scars I'll tell you whose is worse lets unwrite these pages  and replace them with our own words  We live on front porces, and swing life away. We get by just fine here on minimum wage. If love is a labor, I'll slave till the end. I wont cross these streets untill you hold my hand.  Been here so long  I think it's time to move. The winters so cold, the summers over to soon. So lets pack our bags  and settle down where palm trees grow.  I've got some friends, some that I hardly know. We've had some times, I wouldnt trade for the world. We chase these days down, with talks of places that we will go.  We live on front porces, and swing life away. We get by just fine here on minimum wage. If love is a labor, I'll slave till the end. I wont cross these streets untill you hold my hand.  Swing life away      lol  i love this song and it says that money doesnt make everyone happy as long asyou got the ones around you that care then you will always be happy... unless your pmsing lol ok i must go my duties call... or not bye
