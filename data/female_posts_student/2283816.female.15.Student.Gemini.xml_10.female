The reason I've kept it inside so long is this: I didn't want it marred by other people. I wanted it to be all me. I did not want the influence of anyone else on it.  If I DO get it to a publisher, I'll likely have to extend it. :( This will be a project, and I've already extended it till I couldn't extend it anymore. I didn't want to have more.   I am so afraid. It's like I'm truly opening my soul up - this is my ideal story. This story would be the one in the library that would catch my interest and be what I would want to read. It's very near and dear to my heart right now. And if it's hated, I will feel horrible.  But I would like honesty. Honest opinions will help.   Sark is sexy. Bad writing is not. I would be a more believable Lauren Reed than Melissa-Ego-George.  *sighs sadly* Alias... come back to meeee....well at least next week we get the comforts of Sexy MenOnAPlane! *grins* Bye, y'all.
