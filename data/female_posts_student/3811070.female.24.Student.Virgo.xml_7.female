Strangely, the burning stopped this morning, but she said that if it starts again to give the on-call doctor a ring and they'll order me a pee test.  So next appointment in 2 weeks, where I get a vaginal exam! Hooray! She's going to tell me if the baby is head down or not, if I'm dilated at all, and if I have Group B Streptococcus, I think it's called. Well whatever it's called it means the doctor getting that damn cooter-spreader out of the fridge (ladies, you feel me?) and digging around in there with a 5 foot long Q-Tip.  So anyway.  That being said...  My mother called me yesterday asking me if I remember where my sister's class ring is. So I told her no. And she launches into this sob story about how she's desperate to find it because it's the only thing of Missy's she has left to hold onto and it was Missy's favorite thing in the whole world -- which I can understand because Missy busted her ass selling magazine subscriptions for that ring-- and she  needs  it and am I sure I don't know where it is?  So I tell her again, no. We've gone through this before twice since she died, and both times I told her that I think Missy gave it to someone.  So my mom tells me that she's already contacted one of Missy's old boyfriends (David N.) who lives in Ohio with his two strange ass kids to see if Missy might have given it to him. This guy moved away about two years before Missy died so my mom just wrote this guy a letter saying, for all intents and purposes, "Hey, Missy died this December. Do you have her High School Class ring?" What a shitty way to break the news to someone about their ex-girlfriend!  So then she asks me "Do you remember where Dave M. said he was moving to in California?"  I was like... woah.  Dave M. was the manager at the bar/ restaraunt where I worked as a DJ. Dave, in the beginning, was my friend, and I introduced him to my sister, and he became the great love of her life. He treated her like crap, because (and I'm not saying this to be a bitch.) Dave wanted to get into my pants and I refused him, so this asshole turned his sights to my sister to try to weasel his way in closer to me. I know this because he told me so. And I never told Missy or my mom cause it would have broken their hearts. So anyway, Missy struggled against Dave's on-again-off-again romance with her like a true martyr, even after Dave got busted for selling coke in the restaraunt where we worked and lost his job, and then left Missy for Susan, one of his customers. They were still "friends", she said. Friends, meaning Missy would invite him over for holidays and random dinners and buy him presents that she couldn't afford and then get mad when he wouldn't return or reciprocate her feelings, but then she'd take him back when he came calling with some lame-ass apology. (when all he actually wanted was for her to keep showering him with gifts and free sex) Sorry, I just... Dave pissed me off really bad because he was the one who called me and informed me of my best friend Ann's death (she worked with us as a cocktail waitress on Karaoke nights and became my best friend) by saying "Hey, Mary. Uh, Ann's dead, have you heard? Are you coming in to work Karaoke tonight, because it's still on, even though... you know, Ann won't be here."  (She went out on her night off the night before and got drunk, drove home, and died in a car crash.) So anyway, to make a long story short, Dave decided to pack up his stuff and Susan the whore and move back out to his hometown here in California, somewhere on the Northern Coast. And my mom thinks I know where he is.  And she wants to write him a letter asking him if he has Missy's class ring. Right.   This makes me so mad because my mother and my sister are   notorious   for not only re-gifting (especially shit that I gave them they'd give to me for my birthday...) but for giving away things that supposedly meant something to them. My sister loved the University of Alabama Football team, for instance. So one year for her birthday I made like a billion calls and finally talked to the football coach's secretary and got her a signed football from him for her birthday. So what does she do? A year later, she gives  that very fucking football  to my dad for Christmas.  What. The. Fuck. ?  So anyway I can't think why my mom would want this ring back  now , after all this time of not having it. I can't understand why it's so important to her to have... because it's just a  thing  and not really any part of  her ....  I'm so confused. So now she's going to go on this crusade to find this ring. More power to mom.   Sad thing is, it might be in a bunch of boxes of stuff I have in storage... Missy left me a lot of stuff when she died, including her jewelry box, and it might be in there, only I can't bring myself to go through it because the memories still hurt pretty bad.  *sigh* Goddammit. What do I do?   -Me
