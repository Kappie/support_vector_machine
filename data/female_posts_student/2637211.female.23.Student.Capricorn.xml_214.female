As I sit here looking at the jumble of crap I managed to write on my screen, I realize that I hate staying up late writing crappy papers. Maybe it would be better to work eight hours a day, then go home and screw around. Of course, that's unrealistic too, because when you're a grown up, you have to do things like paint your house, pay your bills, do the dishes, vacuum your carpet and eat healthy grown up food that you had to push through the always crowded heathfood store to get. I suppose I just have to get used to the idea of working a lot for money, spending said money on a crappy house that needs a ton of work, and not having enough time for the good things in life, like sleeping, drinking and smoking that unmentionable stuff that'd I'd never do because it's, like, illegal, man. That's the good life, as long as you can do it all on your own property and not have to worry about being a renter. I'm sick of being a renter, so maybe I have to make the move to adulthood soon. Weird. Look at me, I'm rambling again. Back to the role of the mestizo in Spanish colonial society. Oh Boy.
