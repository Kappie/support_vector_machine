It's this new foundation I've been wearing for about a week... the L'Oreal True Match crap has been wreaking havoc on my face. No more of that! Back to my Neutrogena stuff.  I went tanning today and stupid me let her put me in a high intensity bed for 15 minutes. My face is as red as a tomato right now! If there's one thing I hate, it's having a sunburn. I almost got up the nerve to steal some new lotion on the rack by the entry desk while she was setting up my bed but chickened out at the last minute. I probably will next time.  I called two hospitals today to start doing some volunteer work but get this... neither of them had any  room  for me. What is that? Since when does a huge hospital not have room for free labor? Unbelievable. So I called nursing home (gag) and set up an appointment for tomorrow at 1:00 to discuss volunteering. I'm not really looking forward to volunteering there but hey... it looks good on my college app I guess. Plus its mostly just reading and playing games right? Yeah.  Yesterday Ellen and I went to play mini golf with her brother. It was really hot though so we barely got through half of it. She took pictures of me throwing my golf stick and posing inside the little miniature houses though. That should be... interesting. Afterwards we went to Smoothie King and I got my Caribbean Way and then we just stood outside and blasted pop music from my car and danced by the road. Some people got a nice show... her brother also took a picture of me hugging the huge inflatable Smoothie King smoothie. Those are going to be some weird pictures.  Lately the more I look at my eyes the more I want to fix them. The strabismus is getting irritatingly obvious and I feel cross-eyed whenever I look at myself in the mirror. I've officially decided that I'm going to get a job, and I'm going to save up my money until I can afford the surgery, and that's that. I don't care what my parents say, I want straight eyes. It's not right that I always want to cover up my eyes with sunglasses because I feel ugly otherwise. It's not right that I cried myself to sleep because I was so depressed over it. I KNOW this can be fixed and I'm determined to do it.
