Almost two years ago, I found myself at a moral crossroad.  I took the path I thought I wanted.  But this path has had its winding doublebacks and thickets full of thorns, and I ended up not where I thought I would be.  Yes, I am surrounded by those who love me with all their heart.  I am back in school actively persuing my undergrad degree.  I have a roof over my head and a meal in my tummy.  I surround myself with life in varied forms... plants, a cat, the spider in the window, the dust bunny population under my bed.  But I find a deep, unsettling, yet small blackhole forming in the dark recesses of my mind.   I feel as if my life has been in pause for years now.  Neither moving forward or backward, just existing day by day.  From the outside it would appear that I'm in perfect momentum, achieving my goals and dreams.  Yet... I don't know what my goals and dreams are.  I meld my being to those around me.  I don't know what it is like to be the person I call me.  I woke up today finding myself full of resentment, anger, even hate... and I asked myself, when did I become so full of negativity?  When did I truly stop living my life?  Maybe the better question is, have I ever lived my life? Faith... never offered me solice.  How can it?  Faith is a personal contract with divinity.  It can be forged and broken on some of the most insignificant or life altering terms.  Likewise, religion leaves me lost amongst a group of perfect strangers.  There is an undefined emptiness inside of me, pushing me on a quest to find the elusive, intangible object of something I do not know.   So, the question is... where do I go from here?  Do I continue this meandering existance, reacting to every situation?  Or do I learn to understand the spirit of things, flow fluidly like a willow with my life and stop trying to be something I am not.
