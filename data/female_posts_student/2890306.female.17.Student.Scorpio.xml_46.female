Rain patters on my roof and steam billows from my green tea as I pen this, and I couldn't be more content.  I just finished creating a whole bunch of graduation cards for my friends.  My upcoming weekends will consist of traveling to many open houses, and what good party goer doesn't come prepared?   *shrug*    Anyhoo, since I abandoned my social butterfly wings this weekend, I haven't much of an update to give you.  I'm sorry.  Luckily though, I come prepared with a song.  Its melody is gorgeous, so please give it a listen.  I'll even include the lyrics.   Burn me down if that's how everything's gonna start With a flame from the heat of the look on your face On a day like today could have made out every raindrop falling down on your head Now I fear that I may taste these tears rolling down my face and realize Something is wrong with the light of the sun in the core of the sky  With you and everyone
