We're going to discuss all the boys, girls, hockey games, hockey boys, Niko Kapanen, Dallas Stars and pretty much everything that's related to hockey in some way.  it'll be fun and i'm sure we'll have tons of inside jokes and dirty jokes by the end of the night.  Feel free to talk to us online, because i'm sure we'll be bored soon.  Or you could call me on my cell (214-274-9466) to entertain us.  Especially if you're a guy.  Today was an awesome day....i had little parties in practically all my classes, it was fun!  And i did not get mobbed by a mass group of people today, lol Brittany!  Everyone was really happy today and that was good.  So here's the juicy story of the day.  Me and Brittnee were phone cover shopping for my Nokia and we stopped at this verizon phone booth and these guys were all talking to us and telling us how pretty we were blah blah blah......and then the White guy hick asked Brittnee for her phone number and she was like how old are you?  Guess how old he is?  21!!!!!!  And she goes "Hell no!!!  You're too old!!!".  The Black guy that was helping me with my phone started laughing hysterically.  Those guys thought we were 18.  Yet they must've thought Brittnee was prettier than i was because he went straight for her and completely ignored me.  Yet another thing proving how unattractive i am.  Anyways, yeah so then this hick guy's brother called and we decided to talk to him.  I grabbed the phone and started talking to him.  Turns out he's a hick also so i give the phone to Brittnee.  Brittnee gives this 18 yr old guy that she hardly knows her phone number.  And he's all like ok i'll call you later tonight.  I slapped her and told her that her mom was going to kill her.  She was just like whatever.  Yeah so now she's with me now, reading this and critiquing what i say.  lol, now we're going to watch my Niko play some hockey against the Florida Panthers.....yaaaay!!!  ttyl!  Go Niko go Niko go!,  ~~~Taylor~~~
