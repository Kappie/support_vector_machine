Ok so I cant really afford it but I cant afford anything so I will deal. It will mean cutting back on a few things but I can do that. The comfort is that Robin will be around for going places and we can hang out together. I miss friendship. Someone to talk to you know that coffee type thing. Or in our case Tea nether of us drink coffee. I really wish that AC woudl show up. Speaking of AC I got another one of those calls again. I wonder what they mean. I didnt get one the day he e mailed me and the following day. I got them starting three or four days before he e mailed me.. I dont know what to think. I know it is a sense of comfort. I mean seriously what are the odds of it being a "wrong" number ? ? ?  Today is laundry, dishes and bathing Luci. Luci is our ferret. WHich means *I* get a bath today. She loves to play. Not sure if she is playing or wanting out Lol.. Ether way it's a .. adventure.. to say the least. A store had a great sale and I made it. Got a few good deals like Kool aid 10 for a buck, soup 10 for a buck. I got several dollars worth of both. Plus frozen veggies same.. 10 bags for a buck. I was excited. well I have chores to do and calls to make.. So I will go for now. I dont want to I want to write more but I dont know what I want to write and I think if I dont end this now I will ramble.
