Either one of those, or two, or all three. We'll see when tomorrow comes.      I need to be done with English 2, Physical Science, and Algebra 2 by the first week or so of October.      Note- Yahoo Launchcast Radio rocks my world.      I finished watching the first four episodes of Tenchi in Tokyo today. Next I have episodes eight through 10. Hmmm, I guess I will have to buy the manga for in between.      I changed the format and colors for my other journal. I love how it is now! Especially compared to before.      I need to read more. I mean, I read a lot online. But I should read more of actual books. I usually do... not lately though.
