But i did find out that Kate is moving to madison before school...so if i ever feel homesick, i can chill with David P, and Linda!  It shall be fun!   The day was fun! I went to Vicki's Grad party at Pebble Valley, and when i walk in...I look at nicole, and see that she's wearing the same outfit as me...unplanned!  Blue halter top, khaki shorts, and our baby blue adidas sandals!  It was sooo weird, we had people asking us at each party, if we had planned out outfits...NO!  After vick's party we headed to joe's partay!  It was fun, we played some volleyball, and some hold 'um, and we watched Old School!  Cool Night!  It was funny...Joe's Intimidated by me!  hahaha oh well...apparently I was "too attractive" to talk to in High School, and that when we were placed in the same Psych class...i had to speak first-you wuss!  Thats ok, i got a really cool friend out of it!  It just took us a while to speak to one another! hehe..Go Joe! haha  Man I really want to find out my roommate for college...this is getting ridiculous, everyone else is constantly talking about their roommates, and im so left out!  lol, oh yeah and i have 6 days to turn in my transcripts...uhh, im getting scared!  I dont like seeing my guidence councelor!  oh well, if its needed, i guess so!   Ahh...off to watch the Count of Monte Cristo!  Damn good movie! As my intimidated friend Joe would say:   Have a Good One Everyone!
