It's a trifle queer ne? That I dreamt of a wedding when I wanted to die last night (for further infomation click on the livejournal link up thur). Trifle queer too that the moiff was creamy white and soft blue. If I remember correctly I removed the colors blue and white from my motiff list for my own wedding... (Current favorite colors: orange and gold.. nyahahaha!) But the weirdest element in the story is that the groom is B. Remark: He's out of my bishboy list.  But last night, I was pondering about love and it was the first time in, at least, half a year I prayed. I prayed for love... Then I got that gift... His way of saying... He... (not B) may not be for you... Should I wait? hmmm... Siguro nga...
