Here, thousands of contestants throng the streets of the tundra in traditional dress, singing the national 'mole anthem' unique to Siberia, and ending with the strident tones of"Burrowing everlasting, mole will live forever". The festival includes a mole market where pet-owners can invest in all manner of mole accessories, including mole leads and collars, as well as mole toothbrushes that keep those cheeky little goofy molars fresh. And for the mole stallion, there are opportunities to engage with mole hotties for nominal stud fees on this festival day. The bowling itself is watched by millions on their TV sets at home, and by hundreds at the enormous screens that populate the hills of Siberia. With prizes ranging from 'The Mole Experience', a hugely expensive 'live-like-a-mole' experiment unseen any where else in the world, to the complete mole set up, including an entire mole family, the competition is massively over subscribed in Siberia, and has to turn away hundreds of entrants.
