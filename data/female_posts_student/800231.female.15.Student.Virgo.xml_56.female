Anyway, I went with Mia, Kaci, Dan, and Kai instead. We went out into another part of the campus woods to smoke. Dan had a sweet bong, pretty and blue. I like blue... It was my first time using a bong though, that's a pretty strange experience. It was totally great until Dan decided to replace the water with some of my Sprite Remix, trust me, it's not a good idea. We're going to go do it again tomorrow. After I take my math finals we're off to party in the wood, Kaci and I are going to build a tire swing and then we'll eat, smoke and swing. Loverly...   Me and my daddy are cross-state on Friday night. We're bringing his entire group too. My mum was less then impressed though. This afternoon we were sitting in Starbucks talking about the trip. Mum: "Wait, you're traveling six hours on your motorcycle just so you can sleep in a room full of hairy men?" Me: "Yah, pretty much... They're really nice hairy dudes though." She just stared at me for a while but I think we're good anyway.  Tomorrow is the last day of school! So I get all summer to do nothing, in style! I'm off to practice now.
