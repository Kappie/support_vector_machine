You may or may not be close enough to me to have heard me talk about it, and you may have seen me continue to smoke.  This is the thing: I have been going to this very cool woman named Gwen who helps people quit.  The process is not instant.  In reality, smoking is a complicated thing- it plays a lot of roles in our lives.  In order to quit, and quit well, you either need some kind of tragic thing happen to you or you need to understand your patterns, the why and how and when of it all, and then move on from there.  I have spent the last three months: delaying, journaling, thinking about, reading about, cutting back on, analyzing, considering, talking, and (yes) inhaling cigarettes.  So, I am at a place where I am starting to understand some of the reasons, beyond the physical addiction to nicotine, that I smoke.  Its hard to really understand unless you have an addiction I think, but I am processing here.  SO what I am thinking about, and may journal on in the following week, is about what smoking really is. I am journaling about why I smoke, and why I might be afraid to let it go...  Smoking is an instant connection.  You go out, and there are people there that you don't know, and you ask them if they can bum you one, and you stand and talk about nothing really, but it feels like a connection.  You go out with someone that you are curious about, who you want to know better, "want to go have a smoke?" and you have a safe, timed space in which to dialogue.  Maybe these are chicken reasons to do it, maybe I could do this anyway; "Want to go for a ten minute chat outside?"  But really, smoking is a way to do it within the confines of a society that has little real personal interaction.  It is a window, an opening, a line to start on, a ritual of connection.  When I go out and smoke with a friend, there is a space to process; "I need a cigarette."  Am I really saying that I need one?  No.  I'm saying; "I really need to talk about something and I want to vent about it and I need some support."  In a way, its easier to say it with a ritual- you aren't as exposed, you're not as forward.  It is something that is familiar to both parties.  Its scary to think about not having this.  Its frightening to think that I will have to invent new rituals, rely on new kinds of interaction.  If I'm at a party, and want to talk to someone alone, and don't want to hit on them, just really want to focus on them, I could go smoke with them, or ask them to come out with me... What do I do other then that without being creepy?  We are a society that is truly devoid of these conventions.  Now that smokers have been forced outside, into solidarity, it may even be harder to quit.  There will be no replacement for this.  Crap.    There is the allowance of a smoke.  When I am focused, when I am taking a break, when I am putting something off, smoking allows that.  We are a society where if you don't smoke, you sometimes wont get a break.  You wont be allowed that ten minute chat, that ten minute meditation, that alone time, that space.  I am sitting and taking deep breaths, and yes, they are filled with smoke, but they are conscious breathing.  I have never lit up un consciously- for me it is always a space of time in the moment.  When I need to sit and read for a second, when I need to get away from work, when I need to have a different environment in which to think, when I need to -stop- and notice what is around me, smoking allows that.  There are other things, but they will not replace it.  There are other things that I could do that may be similar, but will never, never be the same.  At a certain point, I will not miss it some much, and it will not weigh on me, but it will never be the same.  They are cool.  No matter what you may be able to say, for our generation, there is appeal to cigs.  They are what the coolest bad guys do, and the good guys, and they are sometimes pretty convincing.  They can be a shield of coolness when you are frightened;   enter girl in black pea coat.  Its raining.  She is in a foreign city far from home.  There are people she doesn't know, and is unsure of.  She is waiting for the train.  She stands outside, rain dripping through the corrugated tin roof and smoke drifts lazily up from her.  She is able to observe without being strange- she is out having a smoke, with nothing to do but look.  She is worldly, not a lost 18 year old far away.  She is centered, and breathing, and not afraid.    Enter; there is a hostel in Seattle with a balcony and there is coffee, and you can look down onto the street, over to the market place and sit and watch, while you breath in moist smoke and sip dark coffee, and it feels glorious in memory.  Inside is the internet station, and a lover has just written saying that he was wrong, and you can let it all go, because you here, right now.    Enter; walking the wet streets of Freemont, Washington.  I am having coffee, its another hour till I get to hangout with people.  I have been walking all day.  Wandering in a lonely and confused haze.  Trying to stretch back into comfort, knowing its lost for the rest of this trip.  Best coffee in Seattle, pisha.  I had better at the hostel last trip here.  I buy a pack of cigarettes, get some stimulant into my system.  I am conflicted, and I am confused, and I keep wanting to cry but I know that it is far past that, and there is a space being cleared out in my being for something new to come, and I am journaling for shit this trip, and I have spent too much money that will have to come from somewhere and I don't know where, and I still am in love, but cant get over the feeling love has left me for less painful eyes, love has left for forgetting, and frankly, fuck it all, I want to smoke and stand in the rain and be a romantic forgotten Hollywood heroine, alone and ready for whatever.    I have a memory in grade school which is two memories.  I am standing alone on the playground, by the dome metal thing, and its grey out, and the others are lining up for class again.  In my mind, I am pretending; it is in black and white and I am tall and have dark curly hair, in a rain coat.  The Eiffel tower is behind me, and, yes, there is a thin drift of smoke coming from the cigarette in my lips.  There is mystery in that brief memory, and a story, and another time and space- 1940's at its best.  What you may or may not know about cigarettes, is that they are a friend, lover, abusive partner, and devil.  They are there for you when you are otherwise alone, they are available, waiting to be a ritual of thought or no thought as you need.  They are more consistent then people- they wont leave you, though they may damage you.  It is a complicated thing, and not as easy as just stopping.  I wish it was.
