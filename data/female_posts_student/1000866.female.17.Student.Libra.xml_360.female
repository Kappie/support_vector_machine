I actually think I might go sleep at 7:30 after doing my history homework.   Anyway, the parade was long and boring and wet. So, eh. At least it wasn't hot though. We somehow could not manage to stay in a straight line though. It was actually somewhat amusing, but I'm pretty sure I'm the only one who found it to be amusing. Ah well. Then I went shopping and actually bought some of my furniture!! I bought my bookcase headboard and my dresser! I think I'm buying my computer desk tomorrow and then my entertainment center thing later. :) YaY! We also picked out the paint for the most part. I definitely am sponge painting my walls AND I get to help!!! Wellll, my dad and brother say I can help now, but I bet once I start to, they'll tell me I'm doing everything wrong and then tell me to go away. Oh well, I either get to have fun painting or be lazy. Either way, it will be a fun day.   I also bought a new sweater, and a new pair of pants. Haha, I'm terrible....I can't go to the store without buying SOMETHING. My mom got a pair of shoes which I'm goiing to steal too. So....yay! Good day. I guess I'll go do my history homework now, then go sleep...or something. School tomorrow. Goody.
