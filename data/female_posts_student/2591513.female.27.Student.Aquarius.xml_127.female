I may put Bailey back at St. Mary's.  I just don't feel comfortable.  I don't know I and I can't explain it.  Anyway I found a very interesting quote from my sister's calendar gift to me...    "The human Heart does not stay away from that which hurt it the most. There is a return journey to anguish that few of us are released from making."  --Lilian Smith   Then it says:  * When I am ready, I will have the opportunity to make these return journeys to old hurts with the knowledge that I can heal them and move on. *  I thought this was very interesting and a very good quote for a dear friend of mine.  I hope she is reading this and taking it in.   Well what else...the parents are going out on a date.  I thought that was cool.  Ed isn't going to be home until Tuesday...so unfortunately he is going to miss Father's Day...  =*(  Poor kids, their daddy is away on training.  Anyway, I better get going.  I have to go to work and then have a final interview tomorrow at the Stuart Mesa daycare...wish me luck guys!!!
