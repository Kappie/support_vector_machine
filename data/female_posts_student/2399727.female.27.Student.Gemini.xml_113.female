Why is it that once I've decided not to do something, I become very interested in it?  (sigh)  Got invited to try out Gmail today.  That's the Google email that reads all your email, apparently.  It doesn't have a "delete" button; just invites you never to delete another message again in return for giving you 1000mb of storage space.  Interesting concept.  I shall see how it unfolds.  Went to Mr. Greenjeans last night.  Great food!  Rez is offering cheapie pizza night so I'll be partaking in that as well.  Can't beat two slices for $1.  Did orientation for Extern yesterday.  They assume that because your job description is "student" you packed your brains away someplace and have no intention of using them in "the real world".  Very irritating.  I have come up with about twenty questions for my sponsor but I won't know until Monday what format my placement will take.    More to come...
