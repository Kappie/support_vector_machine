Actually, it's about two people in particular, I dunno, maybe even more peeps then that. I won't mention any names since *ahem* some of you already guessed one of the people. haha. The chorus is about a best friend I had in San Fransisco, I haven't seen her in forever and we've grown apart. The two lines are, of course, about that other someone.  Went to see Spiderman2 with Hans, and Gi, and Ashes yesterday. What an awesomely great movie!!! It has the best special affects of any movie I have seen.... Perhaps with the exeption of LOTR, but those are a different kind of effect. It had really good acting too. Toby Mcguire (sp?) rocks!!!! It's reallllllly intense if you watch it in a movie theater. We were sitting like right under the speakers. It was great. Lots of good quotes in that movie too. "Hi... Hi.... This is really heavy." or "Hi? What's hi? Can I spend it?" hehehe.   After that we went to Walmart so that I could buy a tankini, but NOOOO, all they had was lame looking one pieces designed for... er... large people... and bikinis. I contemplated a bikini but... *evil cackle* haha. "The biggest piece of fabric on it is the how to wash tag." lol  And then we got sandwiches at Subway. Love that place. Had a terrioky (shut up, I know I can't spell)chicken like always. Lots of fun stuff.   so ya.... I'll sign off now... G2G to stuff....   Signing off - Jakk (oooo, I like that spelling.... or maybe Jaak -hmmm)
