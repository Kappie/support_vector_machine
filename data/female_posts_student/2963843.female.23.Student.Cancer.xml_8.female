Spent my Saturday in total boredom Went for lecture then read a 50 page paper.. Original plan was to go shopping at Bugis together with bf. But he had a cross country run today.. Thus, I decided to be a good girlfriend and let him have a good rest. See the halo on my head? I earned it! I'm an angel... A fallen angel.. Hell I wish I was the devil... I might have more fun.. =p  Anyway my investment lecturer is a very perculiar guy.. Have you ever wondered why ancient chinese vampires (jiang shi) hops? According to him, it started in the Song dynasty. The vampires were actually soldiers who were sent for wars in foreign lands When they got killed, these soldiers would get their bodies returned to their hometowns. The chinese believed that deadbodies need to be transported back to their hometowns so that they can be reincarnated and not be wandering ghosts. The legs of these dead bodies would be tied with a name tag at the end when they are being transported back. However, the bodies would only be transported at night as they have a stench and also to prevent frightening the villagers. These transporters would carry a bell and ring it as a sign to instruct villagers to close their windows and stay indoors while they transport the bodies.  Therefore, taoists use these bells to 'call' spirits now. They also use a whip for their horses.. Thus, those villagers hiding inside their houses would imagine that the 'spirits' are hopping their way home to the whipping sound and the ringing of the bells.. However, he told us that the traditional Jiang Shi do not suck blood, its the Hong Kong shows and western influence of vampires that evolved into the Jiang Shi we know now..  hehe.. Interesting investment theories dun cha think? Anyway just food for thought..  Loneliness seem to exist in many different forms There are still periods of loneliness even when one is in a relationship.. Don't you think?  I wish Sunday would be a better day.. Am crossing my fingers here...
