After we took showers and got ready we left for Huntsville!! We got up there bout 12:15 or so and went shoppin for a lil bit!! After we got done shoppin we went to **LEVI**'s house!! I kinda felt outta place at first b/c his mom was cleanin and makin him help and we were just sittin there...hmm funfun!! Well we decided to like go get some food while he finished cleaning his house and shit...So we went to the mall and looked around and then went and got some potatos...And chilled for a lil bit then we went back over there....We sat around and talked and I watched Amber and Levi play chess...b/c of course I had no freakin clue what they were doing... :\ After that boring game we decided to go to the skate park so Levi could skate...He was like the cutest guy out there :P He is pretty good too!! We sat there for a while and stuff..He broke his board so we left.. He was going crazy he was happy he broke his board...lol...We took some pics of him skating and stuff... I think I took a picture of him wrestling with him dog too ...lol... Amber got a couple of us.. one of us sittin by each other on his bed one sittin on a couch and one of us huggin aww how sweet...lol. After we left the skate park we dropped off his lil cousin and then we went riding some more!! After we got back we went and chilled with his brother and his wife and their baby...it is like one of the cutest babies ever!! He was just smilin and laughin the whole time.. We sat and talked for like EVER and then finally we had to go so Levi walked us out to the car and gave me a  hug **thats when the picute was taken** And we said our goodbyes with a kiss on the cheek :D And we left and on the way home we got some Smores capaciano and then came home and wrote this!!
