I see all these people on the news mourning the deaths of those lost 2 years ago, and I feel terrible for them.  But I'm so angry and upset with American foreign policy that it's almost gotten to the point that I see an American flag and think "WTF is wrong with us?!  I give up--I'm leaving."  Which, on a day like today, makes me further pissed off b/c I feel like I'm not being respectful enough.  Maybe I just need to go ahead and permanently move to Latin America.  Might as well--the majority of my waking moments are spent planning how to get back anyway.  Speaking of going back...I'm going mad trying to finish this Fulbright application for Brazil.  The really good news is that (and I think this is fate) I e-mailed half a dozen people in a stressed-induced panic about everything from being sponsored in Sao Paulo to getting recommendation letters.    Seriously--I shit you not--everybody replied within 30 minutes.  The director of the program in Brazil, the Fulbright advisor at UT, and the profs who are writing my rec letters.  And this was like 10:00 at night.  They all told me either a) not to worry b) they'd be thrilled to sponsor me, or c) it wouldn't be a problem if recommendation letters got in a little after the due date.  Did I mention that Joe Straubhaar, the director of the Brazil center and one of the good friends of the man sponsoring my project in Brazil, also happens to be on the UT Fulbright committee?  I am so excited.  And even if I don't get the scholarship, I'd love to go back to Brazil and research the topic further.  If you're wondering what I'm trying to research, go here:  Escola do Futuro da USP
