Even though it does have "XXX" at the top and this is most likely the most innocent blog on the internet, I still adore it. It reminds me of oranges, and I like oranges. In fact, I'm somewhat obsessed with the happy fruit.  Anyway...one flaw. I'm sure you've noticed. The text is centered. CENTERED! It almost leaves a bad taste in your mouth after reading the blog. It won't work, but I don't know how to change it. Why? Because I'm incompetent in every way, shape and form computer-wise, and clicking the template button scares me. It really does. So, I need help from all my computer-savvy readers, even though nobody reads my blog. How do I un-center this template and redeem this atrocity?
