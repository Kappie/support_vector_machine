I feel SO much better knowing that that's over with.   In other news, I also called and found out my room assignment/who my roommate is. Her name is Tara Basciano, and she lives in New York. (EDIT: I originally had down Pennsylvania, 'cuz I saw the wrong area code, silly me.)  I'm going to call her tonight I think. I'm living in a 7 person suite, with a living room and stuff I guess, but each bedroom is separate with a roommate. Niiiiiice. Now THAT is exciting. But 7 people...shiiiiiit, I told Carissa, and she said to me, "Good luck with THAT one."  Somehow, that just didn't seem encouraging. Oh well. I'm sure it will work out okay...I hope, lol.  Today when I get home, I have to do some work for my boss on my computer. *sigh* Oh well, atleast I'll have awhile, 'cuz usually when I get home I just do nothing. I'll nap for a bit and then get it done I guess. That'll be good.   Yay, it's been a pretty good day so far. :)
