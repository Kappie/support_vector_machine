In this sense, Jenn and I are twins--we both chafed our feet miserably on shoes we wore for the Harvard interview. It's really disgusting: on the outside of my left foot at shoe-top level there's this miserable blister or whatnot that's not too clean right now, and I don't know what to do with it. I should've worn socks. At any rate, my foot's not going to see the inside of a shoe for a while.  I've never really disliked a Christian, but maybe Matt comes close. It's just that he'll be so irreverent and ignorant and un-Christian for a good while, but then he tells you that he's been praying for you and that kind of puts you off. Then again, I don't know many Christians who are openly Christian...  I've rediscovered the Chopin waltzes, and they are wonderful. Thank you, Artur Rubenstein, you play lovely study music.  I'm still wondering why I got annoyed at anthropology today. Jess, isn't that the name of a store on Third St.? That just crossed my mind today.  After almost four weeks, I still have to marvel at the fact that I get along with Jenn so well. I'm just happy to have her here: I caught her on the way back from screenwriting tonight and we walked over to CVS together. I don't think our moms realized how similar we were when they decided that we should meet before SSP.  I'm kind of looking forward to Sunday alone. I'll have time to re-read Woolf, maybe, and think of a decent thesis this time. I've actually "started" a paper by putting in the heading, but I still have yet to put anything material in its body.  For some reason, the non-students living among us really interest me. Apparently, there's an apartment in the basement of Hurlbut, and every day I can see a desk, a warm light and a bookshelf. Sometimes a cat, at which Charlie will swoon. When the shades are up, I can see a kitchen: dangling pots and pans and a Rosie the Riveter poster: We can do it! There's also someone living right below us in 15--next door to Charlie and Co. When I walk by on Ware St. I can totally tell it's a home, since you can see cacti in the window and in the next, you see the fan from 16. I was similarly interested to hear that Yale house masters live in the colleges with the kids, year-round.  Enough of this. More studying and Chopin.
