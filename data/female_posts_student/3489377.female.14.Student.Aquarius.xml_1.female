Let's see if I can remember the things that I like...For my future reference... 1.My better half, Terik 2.My lack of art skills and such 3.My humor..Even though im getting better at it 4.Anime..Who can't say anime? 5.My video games, can't forget those 6.My writing abalities 7.My friends 8.My sense of creativity 9.Sometimes my smile 10.My eyes 11.My music 12.My evil side 13.My lacking computer skills.. Well, I think that is it. Oh well! Maybe when I read this when im older i'll kick myself in the ass for some things. I dunno. I am completely bored as it is. Im leaving to go to Mississippi soon. Just waiting on my mother to get off of work. My hands are cold..I am completely cold. *kicks the ac* It's cold..Anyway..I need to fix up my blog..
