Anyways, he goes to court on the 22nd and according to his P.O. he'll get 5 days in this detention hall place. Oh well, there's nothing I can do besides go crazy because I can't stop him. His grandma even said "Well obviously she's not a good enough girlfriend because she can't stop you from doing drugs." and shes right. But I dont blame myself because its him that wont listen to me. But anyhoo, Enough about that...  My room is FINALLY painted. (Light Pink) and I still have to paint my shelves and trim black. Then I'm getting star sponges and hot pink paint and making a star border across the top. cuteness!!! I cant wait for it all to be done. I think I'm getting a new bed and dresser too. Oh, I'm so excited I Love This Kind Of Stuff!!!  Well I'm going to bizounce...hehe. Love ya'll!!!!  ***Sometimes you just got to be okay with not doing anything***
