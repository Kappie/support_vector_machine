Well, ever since I first heard this phrase, I have believed it to be crap.   This is not because it is cheesy - cheesy stuff can be sweet and kitschy.  It is crap, simply because the moon is closer to you than the stars. So it makes absolutely no sense that aiming for a short distance, and running out of fuel, will get you a long distance.  The moon is, like, the closest celestial body to the Earth, which means it ain't the hardest thing out there. Metaphorically, it suggests normal success, like pushing paper, not being in debt, having kids, buying a house on mortgage, etc.  The stars, on the other hand, are pretty freaking far away. So getting to the stars would be like finding a cure for AIDS, or being poet laureate, or being the world's first biracial hermaphroditic one-legged lawyer.  *note to self - must submit ideas to SNL for review.*  So that statement is saying something like, "Try to learn to use a calculator. Even if you fail, you will still have that knowledge of calculus" or "Apply for a job at McDonald's. Even if you are rejected, you can always fall back on that degree in psychology."  It should be, "Shoot for ..."  You know what? I can't think of any intelligent way to rephrase that. I just think it'd be funny if school counselors said "Shoot yourself!"  and..... uhhh....  Fargo : "Go Bears..."  [End annoying pessimistic jab at middle-school wisdom.]
