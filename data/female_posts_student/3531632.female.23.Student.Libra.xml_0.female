Well, perhaps that's the wrong way to phrase it - spending 9 hours in an ER is not quite "fun", but when you're the staff instead of the patient it is a bit different.  Got to do quite a bit, from basics like changing bed sheets and transporting patients to helping suture and clean lacerations to having to restrain patients and even got to administer a 3-lead ECG.   Part of me wished we'd seen a little bit more, maybe a serious MVC or at least a CPR, but the rest of me is glad we didn't. I really can't wish that on anyone so that I have the chance to practice.  But, at the same time, the only reason I wish I could see one now is so that once I'm not a student, and am out in the field, I will be better prepared as to how to handle the situation.  Ah well, I have all the time in the world to learn...
