The  urlLink Bachelor  final rose ceremony is just cruel. I've watched three of them at this point, but I think it's so awful to take two people who think they're in love with another person, and at the last minute completely crush one of them, while establishing a quasi-relationship with the other. I just don't get it. Yes, it's good entertainment, sort of, but it's also painful to watch people's hearts broken by reality televison producers. They really are going to hell, and soon.  2. I am getting way too caught up in blog world. There are people I've never heard of who are way to popular... mostly they're club kids and DJs, and they remind me a lot of my sister-in-law's friends, who are only different because they're in San Francisco and not New York. Check out my blogroll, and you'll see what I'm talking about. It's kind of bizarre.   Okay, off to quit screwing around. I'm likely to drive to my old school to sort this mess out, so no posts for a while. Ta-ta!
