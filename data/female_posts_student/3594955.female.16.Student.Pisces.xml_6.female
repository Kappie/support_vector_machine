Decided that:  a) School is crap. b) I had a french exam that i didnt want to do (was going to fail it anyway, so may as well put off the enevitable for AS long AS possible). c) Could not be fucked going.  I just found out that three other of my friends are also 'sick'.     Great minds think alike I say.
