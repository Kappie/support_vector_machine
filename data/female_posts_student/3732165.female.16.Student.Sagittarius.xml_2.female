They moved to Cape Coral. Even the name sounds beautiful. My aunt  uncle want us to move down there actually. And really, I'm not objecting to it. So my parents decided that   if   we go down, if we like it, well maybe we'll move. Maybe not though.    Anywho, yesterday my uncle Tim and cousins Ezra and Derrek, and my uncle's foster kids David, Dustin, Lanelle and some other guy were supposed to come over with my grandma. Well, my grandma had diarhea (sp) so she couldnt come and then my stupid cousin Ezra (what a nut!) was throwing a big time fit so they couldnt come. And they couldnt come today because theyre busy. Grr, i was sooo mad.   I've been having a bad day. Seriously. I cut myself sooo bad in the shower shaving. Like, I have never bled so much from a cut before. It was gushing down my leg like crazy. I was screaming and banging on things and like "I NEED A BAND AID!" and my mom came running in like "Are you okay!" and then i showed her my cut and she was like "Ouch!" cuz it was bad! Then I was straightening my hair and dropped the curling iron on my shoulder so now i have a nice big red burn mark. I seriously am just...so injured today.   I was really bored so I washed the car. It was pretty fun. I cleaned it too. Vaccuum and all. It likes nice, if i must say so myself. Oh yeah, does anybody want to go to the Queen's Pageant and then maybe the dance under the Pavillion @ Alpenfest on Tues? If so, call me or let me know.
