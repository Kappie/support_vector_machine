I'm their best assassin and they send me to kill some high ranking demon!I want to slaughter entire villages not singular demons...Damn it all."  She was seen through a break in the light, long black hair streaked with bright blue, she wore knee high combat boots and a short black kilt that met an inch above her knee. She had on a long black cloak with a few odd symbols on the back embroidered in metallic blood red thread. She had on a black tee-shirt with the word 'FUCT' imprinted on it. Her left ear was pierced 5 times, her right ear 6 times, when she yawned a black 10 gauge barbell ran through her tongue. She had two swords strapped to her back forming an X, in the center of the X was a crossbow. Two katanas lay sheathed on her seat-belt buckle style belt. Her eyes were a deep blood red mixed with a hint of silver, when she raised her right arm to brush back her hair, a tattoo of a scythe on a chain wrapped around her forearm. She stopped and watched the "puzzle" demon cross her path she raised an eyebrow but continued on. Not noticing the demon in all black that sat on a tree watching her.  "If I get this done in the next 8 hours I get triple payout! YES!" she laughed as the castle in the distance loomed like and evil symbol.
