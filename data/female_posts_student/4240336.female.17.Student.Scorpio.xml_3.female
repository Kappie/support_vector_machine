Then we started talking about the Crew and how she wants to basically get me and Bryan in to chill with them all at Twins Pub before Nicko's show. That would be great. She said she doesn't see a problem in them letting us in, as long as we don't drink. She figured this since the show is all ages for one, and one of the other guys on the BB, LordIffy I think she said it was, is actually bringing his kids to the show so he's gonna bring them to the Pre-show get together at Twins. I hope Bryan doesn't mind hanging out with them at Twins. If he doesn't want to, then we'll hang out together longer, and then we'll just wait for them all at about 8-ish outside of Twins and we can all walk to Time Sq together. This is gonna be so great!!! Laura's so amazingly awesome and I can tell the rest of the Crew is too =) I feel so special since they don't mind that we're are 17 and don't mind hanging out with us. They're all so great and loving.  I love Iron Maiden fans [heart]
