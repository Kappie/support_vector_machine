I know that if there is a big city i have to live in...that will be it.   I Love God so much now, because I was able to see him in ways that i would never be able to see before. I loved God already, but I don't believe that is was unconditionally and that it was really really gonna be long termish or anything. Now i know he's staying there...  NOt only did i grow stronger in my faith, but i was able to see God in Chicago, of all places. I was able to be one of the ways that God was working in such a large City.  I was also given the opportunity to become great friends with Ashli a.k.a Mooney (who was already a great friend) Lauren a.k.a Almond (who was a good friend, but now is a great friend) and Elizabeth a.k.a Lefty Loosey Long-Legs-Lane. My youth group also grew.   I LOVE CHICAGO!!!!!
