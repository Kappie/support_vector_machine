I can't wait until it is light our until nine and we have so much less homework and I can just relax and play softball with my awesome Sterling Police and go to our new condo in Maine for the weekends.  But for now I am stuck being too exhausted with too much work to do.    Yesterday, I got $100 out of the $300 that the diGrazias owed me from babysitting 2 summers ago.  Honestly, I was surprised she actually remembered exactly how much she owed me.  I could of gotten some money in interest in it had it been in the bank the past two years, but I guess just getting it is a big step.  I'll have to figure out something I really want and treat myself, but the few things I really really want I think I shall be getting for my birthday, hopefully.  So, yesterday I realized that there are only 3 weeks until my birthday par-tay and I still have no idea what I want to do to celebrate.  Leave a comment and help with ideas please!  All of them will be greatly appreciated!  Seriously need to figure out what I want to do right now.   Must go read for history because I am so far behind and my term project is due in a week and I definitely need to get working on it.
