I have yet to learn how to tell whether the morning's clouds will burn off into a magnificant sunny afternoon or whether they will gather strength and rebell against the LA hordes who wear too-bright clothing and ridiculously high-heeled open toed shoes. Sigh.  They call this june gloom, but let me tell you, this is nothing compared to the annual rain festival that Seattle holds from October to May.  I like seattle, but I must admit I don't miss the overcast skies and chilling damp.  Except that sometimes, like right now, I do.  I haven't seen rain in a long time and the mood that I am in calls for it.  I want to hear the rain smack against my window pain.  (Note to self: move guitar away from the window with the fan in it just in case it rains while I am work).    Depressing thoughts for the day:  1) Mr. Rod still has not returned my e-mail 2) Mr. David still has not returned my phone call (I left a voicemail saturday afternoon). 3) Mr. Shahin however did call tonight and I didn't return his phone.  Honestly I didn't get it until 11pm. Still I knew he would be up and I didn't bother calling. 4) If Mr. David had called in a similar circumstance I would have returned his phone call. Therefor, Mr. David feels the same way about me that I feel about MR. Shahin.  IE, ambiviliant.    I suppose #3 is not a sound inference, still the thought is haunting.  Despite my exhaustion last night I could not sleep. Why? Because I kept imagining what life will be like next year without Mr. D.    More Depressing thoughts:  5) Darbi's boyfriend-type-person, Larry had a stroke.  A bad Stroke. And larry is only 30.  This is bad for Darbi, which means it is bad for me.  Because, as I said in a previous post, Darbi is one of the COOLEST people on the entire planet.   6) We are all going to die, some of us sooner than others and those that don't die face the risk of permanent disability or deformity.  DE-fucking-pressing.  I don't want to die, I don't want to be deformed and I don't want to get old.  I like the illusion that I will be young forever, and I am not too happy to be reminded otherwise  In other news.  I was at a Firm event.  One of the partners hosted dinner at his house.  It was an amazing beautiful house, trophy wife, good help and dreadfully boring conversation.  I was sitting next to steve, who I used to think was okay, but now I think is just a big dork.  Mormon straight-edge dork, that is. Actually, I don't mean dork, I mean arrogant morally superior "nice" guy.  The only thing of note is that Steve grew up in Salt Lake City.  Okay, I know he is straightedge, but I had to ask: "so do you remember that band,  urlLink PCP berzerker ?"  He could tell from the tone of my voice that I thought rather highly of the band so he was polite in his answer.  Yes, he knew of them.  What he was thinking was probably, "yeah, they're a bunch of alcohol and drug users, like I would listen to anything like that.  I like the  urlLink newsboys !"  I might have left at that but I said, "yeah I am friends with most of the band members."  He just said, "oh yeah. that's cool." What I was thinking was, "Yeah, no shit it's cool.  Rod, Eric and Bryan are only like three of the most FUCKING cool people on the planet, so DAMN STRAIGHT, you mother-fucking-straight-edge-stuck-up-dick is it cool."  Anyway, that's eric in the photo (if you bothered to click on the PCP berzerker link) not Rod.   Anyway, I'm being to harsh on Steve.  He actually seems like a nice guy.  And he never mentioned that he was straight edge, or that he was mormon for that matter.  I just assumed so because 1) he did mention that he doesn't drink and 2) he attends  urlLink BYU  law school.  He actually seems like a nice guy.  I am just in a hostile mood.    I am also really exhausted. so I am going to go to bed.
