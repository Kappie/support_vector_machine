I am not used to people being like that, especially in the 12 step meetings I attend for my alcoholism, where everyone is so warm and accepting of differences. I also realized that I need to do whatever it takes to succeed in keeping up my walking and working on managing my stress, and if this keeps up (it was kind of like that yesterday) I will have to start walking on my own, which I would have enjoyed much more yesterday and today. I just don't have any room in my life for that crap. On a lighter note, the rest of the day I napped, played scrabble, ran errands, did laundry, went to two meetings, and took myself out to dinner at the green mill. I would have liked a sunday (for taste!) but my body told me that I was full, so I declined, having the bill drawn up right after ordering the main course helped too, because I didn't want to trouble the waitress by getting the dessert and having to draw up another bill. I did have a tiny piece of cake at the second meeting tonight, but I don't feel bad about it, in moderation (if that is something I can maintain) sweets aren't bad, just not too good. I got a lot of compliments today, and that was nice, it is nice to hear things like that! I also feel that my confidence in talking with others (non-weight related) is increasing, which is nice. I realized today too that some kind of weight training exercise will be good for me, at home or in a gym, because that is good for building bone mass, and for my posture, which pretty much sucks the big one, and hopefully to help maintain my curves as I lose weight. I am looking forward to tomorrow, and I am hoping my walking partner is in a decent mood, I may bring my headphones along just in case!
