No one else turned up and we tried phoning every one, then we went to Jon's house... well, what we thought was his house and we pratted about. Then we asked his sister and she said he was ill! So we spent like an hour waiting for him and he didn't come! We got Laura's present (be very afraid) and Mike got a load of clothes. I got a hemp purse! Yeay! Also I got some gloves... don't ask... so now I'm broke! I went to take out money but I kind of mucked it up! Whoops! It came up with this thing saying 'go to your nearest branch'. Whoopsies. Mmm... we should do some thing on Saturday cause I think Kim moved her thing to Sunday... weird! I get no peace! I'm gonna go out with my Dad tomorrow and then I have to put up with you guys the day after that! Aaargh!
