Aniwaiz...even tho I already posted today, I've decided to post again. Besides, the last entry wasnt really about my day...more about prom. Actually there really is no point of writing about my day today because it was pretty boring. I talked to Josh for a bit on the phone (haha....8 inches??), oh and i cleaned my dresser! FINALLY! I was proud. My dog Lacie attacked my dog Missy. Those stupid dogs just need to go away! ugh! Amanda stopped by for a bit while she was taking a walk. I felt lazy when she came over cuz I was still wearing my pajamas...and it was the afternoon. haha. "INSANE IN THE MEMBRANE! INSANE IN THE BRAIN!" I've decided that orange juice and saltine crackers kick major ass. Conan O'Brian...he's the best. haha. I dont know why, but ya gotta love him. It was really weird...when I was cleaning off my dresser, there was a pack of Juicy Fruit gum...but I dont ever remember buying Juicy Fruit. I'm more of a mint type of girl. It confused me...well thats enough from me. Holla!
