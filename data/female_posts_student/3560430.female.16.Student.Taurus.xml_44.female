I miss my Bethie... A lot. I plan on doing some editing for her. But first I'll catch up on what I did while I was on vaction.       1st day. July 20.       We took off at about noon, one o'clockish. And it was a lovely drive all the way up too Invermeer where the resort Panorama was. I spent most of the drive reading and listening to music. I learned all sorts of interesting facts about the Barenaked Ladies.Panorama was so lovely and relaxing, of course I didn't realise that right away because we didn't get there till about 1am and crashed right away (well not right away I read some more)       2nd day. July 21.      Woke up and determined that there was nothing but junk food in the condo we were staying in so I brought some chips and cheesies up to my room to eat (what I'm on vacation) as I read page upong page of Voyager. My dad then woke up and went to town (literally) for food, you know real food. Then my mother woke up and when my dad got home he ran up the stairs as excited as a child at christmas becasue he managed to shoot some great footage of a baby moose the was munching on grass at the side of the room. Mom and I watched the footage and then dad made us a great breakfast. After that we rotated use of the shower and then went to go check out the hot springs that this place was so proud of. Once we stepped out of the door we were delayed by the colony of cliff sparrows that were building there little city right outside of our condo. Dad had to run back in grab his camera and take pictures. We saw all sorts of sparrow babies and nests, very cute and pretty. After that we went to the over priced general store to grab some sun block, mom forgot ours at home. It turns out that that is one of the things that isn't over priced! That made us very happy. We took a gondola to get up there (this place is on a mountain) it was really great, I've never been on one before. The pools were great it was a hot water spring that also conected to water slides and jacuzzies, as well as a regulare pool. So nice and relaxing. One thing that really suprised me was the fact that none of the lockers had locks, it turns out that this place is relativly crime free... WOW! Once we finished at the springs we headed home. My parents wanted to go to town again (I thought that that was wierd why didn't dad just go and get dinner while he was at the store the first time?) I decided to stay at the condo and read some more. So in respect to that I did read but I also ended up sleeping a bit. I hadn't gotten much sleep the night before. My parents got home and we ate dinner and then I read some more, on the couch this time. Then my mom decided to watch a movie so I pulled out the couch (it was a bed/couch thing). We watched a taped version of Back to the Future III. I've seen the movie so the fact that the end got left out was ok. We got multi flavoured Sherbet to go with our movie. Then I went to bed to, suprise, suprise, read some more.       3rd day. June 22.      Basically the same morning except dad didn't have to go out. Then mom decided we should go play mini golf as she was pretty sure that that was free and she had never done so before. Well we got to the mini golf place and it was $7 a persone to play. Mom was unimpressed with this so she said skrew it we'll go for a walk. We wnded up walking for a really long time along a beautiful river. It was freexing GREAT! I loved it. We turned around after walking up a huge hill for about 1km. My mom didn't want to continue, she was getting too tired, that and she was wearing flip flops. When we got back to the activitie centre we asked where the hill led to, it turns out that we might have ended up going up hill for 5km! Good excersise but my god OW! Apparently we were going the wrong way, if we had started from where the springs were we could have gone down hill the whole way. After that we went swimming in the springs again, really great. The rest of the night went nice and slow, we had dinner cleaned up, got into our pj's then watched Kill Bill. Wow I did not think that that would be as great a movie as it was. Of course I wonder if half the people who liked it understood it. It was fabulous. I'm really looking forward to the second one.       Fourth day. July 23.      About the same morning exceot we had to pack up and leave for Calgary. It was sad becasue Panorama is so great, we're going there next year as well, mom plans on saving up so that we can do some white water rafting and horse back riding and make use of all the other ammenities (I'm hoping for one of those spa day things.) My parents cleaned the place so that it sparkled, all part and partial to the getting invited back by my great aunt and uncle. Once we took off I started reading Queen of the damned but the road was really bumpy so I started getting kind of naucious. So I slept it off. Once we got to Bamff I woke up and we spent a great time shopping. I wish Bethany had been there with me, that place was Moose Mecca! You have no idea how many moose one place can hold. WOW! I even have a picture with me cuddling a giant stuffed moose. When we did finally get to Calgary we debated whether or not to stay in the Best Western. So we got there and they said that they didn't have any more places, which was rediculous because my great Aunt Merideth booked a whole block of rooms for the family, it was really really bad to because we had the rudest man behind the desk treating us like the scum of the earth. Then we went to a bunch of other places and they to were all out of rooms to. We finally found a place (one of the other hotel people booked it for us). When we got there it was 10pm, and we still hadn't eaten dinner, mom was ready to kill. We ended up eating at a dairy queen (gag me my god it was horrid).                          Fifth day. July 24.        Day of the wedding. Good wedding. The ceremony was standard except whent eh bride started to pick her wedgy and wipe the sweat off her hands and onto her dress. We all laughed, that's just the way my family is, and that's really what Brenna (the bride) is like. After that we ran to the hotel room, changed (mom and I were dieing in the clothes we were wearing) after that we went to my great aunt's house to hang out and visit the family we don't normally get to visit. That was really nice. Not really exciting but very nice. Then we went to the reception. That was so good, great food, great fun. First we just nigled then we ate and then we danced! The food was minimul but yummy, and there was more later, with the cake. My aunt Robyn, who was sucking up big time, ended up buying me lots of boose. That was nice but my parents were a little ticked off, not at me they don't mind my drinking, but at my aunt, just on principle. They had to find something to be ticked off at her about. I didn't get drunk though, thought that that would be a bad idea at what is practically a family reunion. I only had three of these vodka, citrus things. I don't know their names, it was called a skrew something or other. I drank jjust enough to get me a little tipsy. What a new sensation! Of course as always I danced my butt off. Such good music how couldn't I? The next day my parents told me that a man walked up to dad and asked who I was, he also remarked on how well I danced. Daddy got all parenty and said "my daughter she's sixteen." The man made a face and looked embaraced, dad won't say any more but mom was quite amused. We went home and slept right away.       Sixth Day. July 25.       Had breakfast at every bodies favourite french resterant Denay's. It was actually pretty good. Then went to the present opening at my aunt merideth's house. Said good bye to my Alberta family and all those I never see then took off for the ride home. It took forever. But was fun, we had a great dinner and I made them sing for a good couple of hours. After that we crashed at home.      I woke up and had a great time sitting. Then played on the computer for a very very long time. Checking my blogs and writing this. I plan on doing nothing for awhile longer.     ....God I miss Bethany.
