Sunday we went out for supper to Melrose Place. Never go to Melrose Place. It's the  nastiest  restaurant. Ever. Ew. I got a hamburger and it crumbled before me. It was so nasty. And. They have lemons in  everything.  In the water, "lemon rice", the ribs...everything. And if they couldn't find a way to add lemons into the recipes of everything, they would put a piece of lemon on a piece of lettuce on the plate. It was rather creepy. Also, when I got up to leave, I happened to look around. I don't think I saw anybody under 95 there. And they have ENORMOUS creepy fish. And creepy paper mache parrots. =/  Monday my dad flipped on me cuz Tyler neglected some homework and erm...apparently Tyler's turning out "just like me". Whatever the fuck that means. I don't even care anymore. He's so fucked up in the head. I'm so used to it now, and I don't think that's normal. But I have better things to blog about, so I'm not going to sit here and bitch about something thats not even worth the time of day. :) I think most of school went rather well that day...not 1st or 2nd though...  Tuesday...rocked. lol. We had to paint these cars in 5th and I wrote Nick's gay in paint on the newspaper covering the table and put a arrow pointing to him. So Nick tattles, but blames it on both me and Travis. So we get hauled down to the office, and my teacher's like "Ok, stay here. I'll be right back." "...And what if I leave?" "Just stay here!" "...Yeah that's so not gonna happen." k. I made the mistake of sitting in the office during 5th for the ENTIRE time already, I'm not gonna do it again. So I went to Lindsay's 5th period class, and luckily there was a sub (Labatte, her regular teacher, knows I skip, I skipped a lot of classes when I had him as a teacher) So I sat there and talked to her the entire time.  And today. Music was. Awesome. I got to listen to people play Led Zeppelin, Metallica, and other assorted bands. On the guitar. And by the way. Wa-wa pedals are GOD. If you don't know what a wa-wa pedal is, you need to DIE. In the corner. By yourself.   Dollar Store. Is god. Especially if you're really cheap like me and don't like to spend a lot of money on shit. Ha. I got this $4.00 bracelet (maybe more) from there. I only paid $1.25. It was awesome! And I got discounts...cuz someone I know works there! Score! But. Maybe she's just an idiot and doesn't know how to work the cash dealy...either way, I win! HEHE I'VE GOT ZEETZ! (Silent z's...)  Also, today. Me and Ashley rode the bus for 3 hours straight. Simply because we had nothing better to do. I took pictures of shwans (don't ask) and random people. You wouldn't believe how funny people look in pictures when they don't know you're taking a picture of them. It's great. People on the bus are rather creepy, I might add. When I got off the bus, my legs felt like rubber. =/  ALSO today, I lost my binder. I think I just left it in the science lab, and I figure Halbert like took it and put it somewhere. At least I hope she did. I had my myth's book, a lighter, and ALL my fucking sharpies in there. And not to mention all the fucking work that I  need  to pass my finals and, you know,  not  fail grade 9. My marks are pretty iffy right about now. Mainly because I've been so slack since like January. Oh well. I'll pass. Somehow. I always do. =/  I'm sure there's something I forgot to blog about. But whatever. Until next time!   -Joebie
