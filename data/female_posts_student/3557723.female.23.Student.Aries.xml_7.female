If you've ever had a pet of any sort, you can understand this bond. I do not have the ability to give this bond the justice it deserves. Perhaps some details of the first week that I had Russell in my care can help.   When I picked Russell from the litter of which only two kittens remained, he was tiny. In fact, the owners thought he was female and the runt of the litter. When Russell curled up, he fit onto a 20cm x 20cm handtowel as if it was a mat.   The first 24 hours was a steep learning curve for me. I thought I knew quite a bit about looking after a kitten. Boy, was I wrong. If it were not for Ronie and Peter, I would have been lost.   Russell was from a farm and had no concept of kitty litter. He  had  to do his business outdoors. This flew in the face of me wanting him to be an indoor cat. It took a week of using dirt in the litter tray and slowly adding kitty litter to teach him that it was okay to use a tray. At least he understood the concept.   The first vet visit was an eye opener. Russell was a boy. I had named him Snowball after  The Simpsons  family cat but that changed. That and he was full of fleas. I had already known that as Ronie had shown me how to comb them out of his fur and how to kill them. His belly was full of worms.   And in two weeks, Russell DOUBLED his weight much to my relief and was declared flea free and in a month, worm free. And now, Russell is a happy healthy 4 kg indoor cat.
