Here's the link:  urlLink more(of)_me   The only difference is that as much as he loves God, I am just as angry at Him. For some reason when I say that, it really hurts--you would think that with as much anger as I have at Him, I wouldn't care. But the funny thing is that I do. My life has been total wreck for a while and only about six months ago did I pick myself back up again and brush of the dust. I don't understand. I had faith like a child, you know, the faith of a child that can move mountains; the kind of faith that trusts God no matter what. But three years ago almost everything I once knew went down the drain, and for six months I persisted, I was determined to trust God no matter what. But then something happened and I felt betrayed. I won't go into details right now, if ever, for there are too many painful memories. Too many times I would rather forget. But that's when I really sighed and closed my heart. At first I talked to Godly people who had previously been my mentors and they told me to read the book of Job. I read it, re-read it, and then re-read it again. I thought that maybe God was just testing my faith at a very young age. But after six months I gave up. Around this time my parents joined this bible study called Bible Study Fellowship. I believe it to be the worst thing ever created to be supposedly Christian. You see, one of the worst things my parents did to me will stay with me forever and when someone has done something horrible to you, you despise everything they love, even yourself. Thus I began to despise God. That is what really triggered it, but the events afterward only futhered my dislike. I feel like a horrible person after saying all of this. And although I didn't put very many details in it, I still feel like I have told too much. Thank goodness no one actually reads this.  I feel like the most horrible, idiotic, ignorant person at the moment.  Maybe it's not just a feeling... Maybe I  know  I am.
