Like no one really knows about it but, you have to do it, just to relax. Mabey it's reading this on a daily basis, yeah right... anyway, When ever I log on-line and the buddy list pops up, the list of people always has a bunch of away messages. I have to read them and I know it's stupid, I just always laugh and roll my eyes at the stupid things they put on there. I'm gonna start writing the quote's they put. But they are so gay somtimes!!! UGH!!1 I hate it! Gotta go, later
