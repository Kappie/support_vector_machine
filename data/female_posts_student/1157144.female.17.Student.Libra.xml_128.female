I don't want to, I want my mommy.  "I wake up in the morning and I step outside and I take a deep breath and I get real high. And I said hey whats going on. I said hey-yay-yay-yay, i said hey.  What's going on?"  "Have you ever been close to tragedy or been close to folks who have Have you ever felt a pain so powerful, so heavy you colapsed No..well I never had to knock on wood and I'm glad I haven't yet cause I'm sure it isn't good.  Thats the impression that I get."  These two songs are stuck in my head.  Damn songs.  They don't mesh too well.
