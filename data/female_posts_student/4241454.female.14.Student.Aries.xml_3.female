I'm looking at my messages I wrote earlier today... I have no life  you know what I should do... I'm reading the comics for 9thElsewhere... and I should put up my graphics here... NAW they suck...maybe I should put my stories up here though.  although if I did that I might as well create a whole separate blog for them.   urlLink blackfire2468@hotmail.com    I am reading alot of anime... I don't know why??? can you explain me to me... pLEASE!  I keep exiting out of my window... why am I so silly???? hmm... I am confusing... Maybe not... but you know how TV shows allways have guys complaining about how confusing girls are... Well they're right WE are confusing...
