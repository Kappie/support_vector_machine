Everyone is so much fucking smarter than me...who am I kidding? I heard my roommate today talking about how her roommates (me and H) like to go out so much and she's at a different place in her life now...I hate her for saying that. She has a boyfriend, she's content with life. Is it MY fault that I don't have a boy to cling to that makes me happy? Does she think I like the emptiness of going out and getting wasted beyond belief every weekend? Not exactly. It really pisses me off to hear her say that she's "just not in that place anymore." Give me a fucking break! Just because you're dating some schmuck seriously doesn't make you in any better place than me. I mean, give me a fucking break! I feel so incredibly low right now...I feel like a little kid compared to everyone else, and I'm starting to see things crawling up the walls and around the floor. I am just incapable of dealing with the bullshit that comes with law school. I should just do school and work and fuck everything else. I can't believe she actually thinks she's in a better place than me! Just because she has a boyfriend, and I go out to party because if I don't, what else do I do for amusement around here? I don't have the crutch of my boyfriend to rely upon! And everyone seems to have someone to keep them warm at night...I only have one friend who can remotely understand what boat I'm in. Two of my good friends are living with their boyfriends, and the rest of them always seem to have someone to count on. Annoying. And you know what? It's only annoying because your friends seem to lose the capability of understanding what life was like when they were single so that they can relate to you. Whatever. I have to concentrate on school now, but I needed to vent. Thanks and goodbye.
