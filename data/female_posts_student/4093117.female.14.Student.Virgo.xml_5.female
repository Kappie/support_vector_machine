I mean, don't get me wrong, I love God and Jesus and all those guys, but the sermon today was on homosexuality (and I'm not crazy about the High School service, either). So I would have had to suffer through an hour and a half of "Being gay is a sin and don't do it! Blah blah blah..." (Ken is an extraordinarily boring speaker sometimes) but fortunately when my dad heard what the sermon was about he decided he didn't want to go. The only bad thing is I got up, took a shower, and then put on shoes. I don't put on shoes unless I'm going somewhere, so here I am WEARING SHOES with nowhere to wear them to! I was so mad. I do not enjoy wearing shoes. Sarah spent the night last night and that was fun. We watched "The Missing." I liked it but sarah didn't, then again we've never had the same taste in movies. She likes "Eurotrip" (*shudder*) whereas I'm a fan of more LOTR kinda stuff. And then we went swimming and there was this giant spider. I hate those spiders! They're  always  getting into our pool at night! One even bit my dad and it had babies on it's back. It was actually kinda neat. Snakes I don't mind. I'm in a painting mood. Hmm. I'll just go to   urlLink  www.isketch.com     and play online pictionary against other people. I love that game, it's so awesome! OMG I am SO close to finishing my article it's not even funny. It's 3 pages long and I still have another article to write tonight, but I intend to make that one shorter. Here's the title for my Olympics article-       Streaking: an Olympic event?       So that really just about covers it. Tata!
