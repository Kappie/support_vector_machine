If it's any consolation, I hear anti-freeze really tastes good.       I had a gynormous sinus headache yesterday. I took two tylenol PM pills and that conked me out for about fifteen hours. I woke up somewhere between the eight and tenth hour, but I went right back to sleep. Lately, I've been having so many headaches. I think it's because I'm always outside in the afternoon, sweating my guts off, and I don't drink enough water.       Yesterday was school registration. Nobody except my old algebra teacher recognized me. If I wasn't so tired and typically irritated at waking up, I would've laughed very hard. People whom I've known since forever (probably two to six years) were there but they didn't say hi. That made me sad. Not really. I didn't say hi either because it takes up too much energy.       So yeah. Pretty much it: school registration, tons of homework, headache. Oh. And I'm on the verge of getting myself a job. I won't say much more than that because it's not final yet.       I'm boring myself now. Here's a picture I drew a while ago:          urlLink        Tell me if you can see it. If you don't, I'm sacrificing this computer to the technology gods. I'm sorry about my crappy handwriting ... and the lack of actual humor in this comic strip ... and the bad drawing-ness of the swing chain. I actually made six strips involving these two characters who have no names. I call them the Goth and the Preppy, even though he's not a goth and she's not a prep. Weird.      Have a nice day and try not to trip on the cow on the way out this time okay?       = cristie
