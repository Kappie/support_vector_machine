Amazing weather, could have done with a few less fights, but I got to meet  urlLink Coral  from the Real World New York and  urlLink David  from the Real World Seattle (Holy Hotness, Batman!) as part of this  urlLink Reality Bar Crawl  thing that was going on.  It was a fun night, Bex and I rocked out, saw an imposter who was a dead ringer from the side, saw 2 bar fights and got our drank on.  Good times.    The boy came back from Canada and it was *so* good too see him.  His birthday present also came in while he was away so, though its almost a month late, he finally got it.  Got to talk lots with Bill, got to clear the air with a few people, got a lot of work done around the house, just generally starting to feel good again.  Billy also explained to me the funniest thing I've probably heard in a long time.  He explained the wonder that is the  urlLink Angry Pirate .  Good times, childrens, good times.
