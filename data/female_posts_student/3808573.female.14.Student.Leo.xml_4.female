I guess I got rele rele rele depressed over some stuff, and decided that I was goin to end it. I didn't..LoL..I wouldn't be writing this if I did, some ppl stopped me...David, Cory, Spug, Colin, and of course Furby. I guess he was the deciding factor, he doesn't know this, but if he hadn't showed that he cared I would've definitly went through with it. I was bound determined, but then Furby stopped me, I guess love is stronger than I thought it could be you know. I was promising myself that even if he tried to stop me I wouldn't listen, because this is what I wanted to do. I don't know, I guess things work out in weird ways eh. Well, now that you know, I think I've made a long enough entry, don't you? LoL.....Love everyone.    K@!
