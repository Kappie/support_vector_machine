To update on the past few weeks, I simply have been doing some websurfing (and a lot of wishing that  urlLink Ladies against feminism  had more articles!), and some last-minute projects. I am also trying to find a national organization through which to run the Conservative club that I am trying to start at my school. I want to start one for a few reasons:  1. Republicans and other Conservatives have little chance to express their voice in my  extremely  liberal school. 2. I want to make the so called "liberal club" look like the idiots they are (Not because they are simply liberals, but because the club was started by self-proclaimed anarchists).  The only problem is I am a little shaky on heading the club. I want to be president, and I think I am capable, but I am not fully sure that it does not violate Biblical headship laws. However, I think that they may only apply to church/family settings and not to a public school. Am I right??  Well, anyway, I also downloaded a bunch of pro-Bush stuff! Go Bush!!! I am praying always for his reelection. I know he is the only Godly choice we have!  Well, not too much else to say...  In Christ Jesus,  Sarah
