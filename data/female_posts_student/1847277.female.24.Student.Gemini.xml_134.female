I have also acheived Zen in that I can now walk properly in flip flops, and I can actually look into the microscope without getting a headache.  You must allow your eyes to unfocus before they can refocus with the scope.  Right.  Anyway.  I told Joe that I learn something about myself, and learn something in general, every time I go to the field.  This year, I said, my goal was to learn patience.  Not something I generally have a lot of.  And I definitely needed it in order to maintain my sanity.  I'm not sure what I'm going to come away with from this project.  Other than lots of knowledge about how to identify bone, which is of course most useful for the future.  But in terms of personal growth, not sure I'll score.  Ah well.
