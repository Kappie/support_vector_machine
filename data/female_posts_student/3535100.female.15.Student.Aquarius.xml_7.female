Until blood soaks my shirt We'll never fall apart Tell me why this hurts so much  My hands are at your throat And I think I hate you But still we'll say, "remember when" Just like we always do Just like we always do  Until the day I die (Until the day I die) I'll spill my heart for you Until the day I die (Until the day I die) I'll spill my heart for you  Yeah I'd spill my heart!!! Yeah I'd spill my heart for you!!!  My hands are at your throat And I think I hate you We made the same mistakes Mistakes like friends do  My hands are at your throat And I think I hate you We made the same mistakes Made the same mistakes  Until the day I die I'll spill my heart for you, for you  Until the day I die (Until the day I die) I'll spill my heart for you, for you Until the day I die (Until the day I die) I'll spill my heart for you Until the day I die (Until the day I die) Until the day I die!!!   "Breaking The Habit"  Memories consume Like opening the wound I'm picking me apart again You all assume I'm safe here in my room Unless I try to start again  [Bridge:] I don't want to be the one The battles always choose 'Cause inside I realize That I'm the one confused  [Chorus:] I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I know it's not alright So I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit  Tonight  Clutching my cure I tightly lock the door I try to catch my breath again I hurt much more Than anytime before I had no options left again  [Bridge:] I dont want to be the one The battles always choose 'Cause inside I realize That I'm the one confused  [Chorus:] I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So, I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit  Tonight  [Bridge:] I'll paint it on the walls 'Cause I'm the one at fault I'll never fight again And this is how it ends  [Chorus:] I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So, I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit  I’m breaking the habit  Tonight  "I'll Be"  The strands in your eyes that color them wonderful Stop me and steal my breath Emeralds from mountains thrust toward the sky Never revealing their depth Tell me that we belong together Dress it up with the trappings of love I'll be captivated I'll hang from your lips Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above  [Chorus:] I'll be your crying shoulder I'll be love suicide I'll be better when I'm older I'll be the greatest fan of your life  Rain falls angry on the tin roof As we lie awake in my bed You're my survival, you're my living proof My love is alive not dead Tell me that we belong together Dress it up with the trappings of love I'll be captivated I'll hang from your lips Instead of the gallows of heartache, that hang from above  [Repeat Chorus]  I've been dropped out, burned up, fought my way back from the dead Tuned in, turned on, Remembered the things that you said   **if theres ne more  i need to put on herre let me know!**
