If I don't, can I accept the fact that I'll be going to ITE..   Please do not get me wrong.. I'm not saying ITE is not good..it is..   but I've always favour poly. I can imagine how heartbroken I will be..      I'm not really sure now..   Judging from my prelim results it wasn't up to my expectations..   Yes u may say it's only prelims.. yes u may say u understand my situation..   You DON'T ok.. I'm struggling my ass out producing results..   I fear my parents,siblings,cousins and friends will look down on me...   Slashing wrists, going crazy..losing sleep isn't my forte...   Do dreams  come true? For now I don't buy that..      3weeks left till N level Social Studies   Mother Tongue Paper..   I'm definately not yet fully prepared. I'm left with 2 theme to cover..   Since having Mr Yunus as our language teacher.. I must admit my results is really pathetic . Is it his strict marking, to make us panicked or is it just me? Seriously my standard cant be THAT low. Never once in sec4  I secured A1 same goes to the rest..       Yes I am a determined girl.. so I've decided..   1. No more internet in my room ..Hide the cables ..so wont be tempted   2. Less time spent watchin TV ..kinda difficult cause the Tv is in my room.   3. Less time talking on the phone/SMS-ing   That means I won't be updating regurlarly.. I'll be using my brother's comp.       No more last min studying. I'm gonna start revision from today onwards..   Get enough rest and plenty of water..(don't wana my lips to be dry again)      Remember that there's no such thing as   ''stress''   and that it doesn't exists.      Gath this sun at yishun...   I'm not sure I'm going..   Time is very precious to me..   Hopefully I can make it yar..   Sorry DVA's..
