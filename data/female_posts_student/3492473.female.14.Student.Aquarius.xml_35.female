So I was all for running for class president. I figured Jessica would want to run for president too because in 7th grade she decided against running against me for spirit chairman. But Kristina told me Jess was just gonna run for VP because she knew I'd beat her. THOSE ARE NOT MY WORDS! So that's what I thought. Then it came time to find people to run for all the positions. A bunch of my guy friends took papers and were like, "Yeah Lor, I'm gonna beat you!" And those things upset me because I'd count on votes from them for me to win, ya know? But obviously in the end none of them ran. So what does the ballot say for all the positions? Candy, the only one running for treasurer. Gen, the only one running for sectary. (spellingon those two positions??) Erica, the only one running for vice president. For president, me (well duh!) and guess who? Jessica. It's not that I was mad, I just wish the girl would have told me other than pretty much lying to me. She told me like a week before the due date of who was running, that she was going for VP and she wouldn't run against me. But hey! She didn't try to tell me she changed her mind! That right there, I didn't respected. So yeah, it was pretty tense with the two of us the week of campaigning. I mean I didn't really like her to begin with but throw in her whining about me stealing her idea to hand out suckers (for which I didn't! and my god,  they're fucking suckers!)  I was ready to just slap her! And then the speeches came. I completely  hate  any form of public speaking. I can write the speech and I could even read it if I didn't have to look up. See, it's the eye contact thing that scares me. I don't know exactly why but I just don't like "eye contact." I messed up on my speech and cut things out and stumbled over my own writing. I kept losing my place. Those are the types of things I always do. But I felt like I did "okay." Jess was after me. And if I do say so myself, she had a really good speech. A lot better than mine I know! At that point I was getting a little nervous. So then we all went back to home room and voted. I didn't know one person who voted for Jess until today. And even now I only know two. I'm not saying it in a mean way, I'm just telling you guys. So we didn't find out until today who won...and guess what?  I WON!  I was really happy about that! I just hate the whole election and campaigning process. And guess what?  Chris is the first man!  Oh and my face isn't all black and blue. It's somewhat discolored and it hurts like a mother! So hopefully it'll feel better in a few days! Well, I'm gonna go eat! I'll probly be back after to write some more because I'm such a loser!
