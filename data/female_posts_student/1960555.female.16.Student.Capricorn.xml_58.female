I'm in a bad mood and she knows why, but she asks me anyways... makes me tell her why.  And it's not like I can not tell her, because you know that she'll sit there and force it out of you in the end.  She just... prys I guess.  Not in a bad way though.  She prys because she knows that I'll feel better once I tell her, but it's still annoying!!  So, I wanna get my nose pierced.  I don't really know why, but, I do.  It's just that everyone has it pierced these days, and as you all know, I hate following trends.  I don't even know if it would look good.  And I cannot find the Bowling for Soup cover of Baby, One More Time.  I have a Fountains of Wayne cover, but it's just not the same.    I'm so impatient.  I never want to wait for things to happen.  I want instant results.  Is that bad, or am I normal for being like that?  What's worse though, is that I don't usually do anything about it.  I just let things happen, then bitch about it later.  Am I hypocritical or something?  I don't even know.  I'm impatient.  I just want him to say yes, then I can stop wondering if he likes me.  I can stop wondering if I have a flying chance with him.    I'm going to go eat the reminants of my birthday cake.
