I'm here blogging now all thanks to my neighbours, going "YAY!", "OLE~~" etc. It's funny how because of them I can't get to sleep, yet ironically, I love them. Haha!  Anyway, reading "Tuesdays with Morrie" for the second time is truly insightful. But twice for now is enough. I should be reading my Lit Text! Which I have not yet even finished once! Urgh.  Gotta go buy Weiyan's present tomorrow and to go shopping with my sister! I need S11.
