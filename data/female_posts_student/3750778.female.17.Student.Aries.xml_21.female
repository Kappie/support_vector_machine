The intensity of the thunder and lightening just demands your attention, there is no way to really escape it. Before it started raining I was standing outside watching the wind blow the trees, and feeling the cool breeze against my face. You can just feel the storm in the wind. What I love most about summer storms is the smell of it all. As I see it, the rain always brings out the best in everything, and it gives everything a new perspective. So I was quite content last night and slept very well thank you.
