I just can't seem to get rid of then no matter how hard I try... I need something to look forward to once in a while, maybe I just need love or a really good friend... I think already have a couple of good friends... Kimi, she will be a friend all through school, I'd have to say the only friend that I ever told everything to was Kotori... She was my best friend and the only one who knew all my secrets that I ever had. She trusted me and I trusted her, I really miss her to talk to. I switched school districts and now I never get to see her. Trish is probably the person who knows the most about me after kotori... I tell her almost everything also... I dont think I will tell my friends about this website, in fact I think it is best that they don't know about it, since I am likely to write about them... I am talking to Kevin right now and he asked what I was doing, so I told him I was typing and now he wants to know all about it... I don't think I will tell him either... Well, it is time that I got off and went and did something else... See you all later...  ♥Jeanne♥
