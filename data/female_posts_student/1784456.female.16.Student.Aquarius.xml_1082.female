To put it bluntly.  sooooooooo i hate being ill, it smells, but the bad thing is you cant actually smell or taste anything.  Lol, my dad was explaining my physics h/w 2 me and i was not  getting it and neither was he so hes taken it 2 work with him so that they can work it out.  HE HE HE HE HE HE HE HE HE im so evil! (not really plz dont b scared little children) The reason you need two people is so that you can spin around and get thge effects of being stoned! Doppy!! Toodles xx
