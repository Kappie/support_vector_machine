Everyday, people have to do many tasks in a limited amount of time.  Try to think about it, would you want to spend time on a letter with negative tone or with an impassionate person?  People rather choose companies who assists are able to provide good service with efficiency. There are thousands of different businesses out there in the world, and I believe that “goodwill” will be the key element in communication that will keep any company moving forward.
