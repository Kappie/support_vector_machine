Afta work they piked me up from my house and we went 2 Jmaras where Debs decided she needed 2 go home 2 get sum more clothes coz she couldnt decide wat 2 wear, then we went bak 2 Jmaras and Nathan and Jeremy left. Debs, Jmara and I just hung out 4 a while dancing 2 music and having a bit 2 drink and then we walked 2 Maccas where we were meant 2 meet Kate and Bec, but they had a car full of ppl already so they couldnt pik us up. So we called Jeremy and Nathan, HAyden and him came 2 pik us up. We went driving around out 2 the pines and stuff then we went 2 see da possums coz Debs had neva seen a possum b4. We drove around a bit more and then they dropped me off at home and that was my nite. It was fun, but I wish I had opf been allowed 2 stay out l8er than 10. I would have stayed at Debs last nite except that it is my brothers 18th birthday 2day and mum wanted us 2 have a special breakfast 4 him this morning. Im annoyed at myself a lot bcoz when Im around a guy who I find atrractive and kinda like I get very shy and it pisses me off. I wanted so bad 2 impress Jeremy but Im not his type, hence the reason I hate being shy. Im too prim or sumthing. I know he likes Debs, I could just tell if u know wat I mean, Im not angry at her i would be so happy for her if he did like her im just a lil upset that theres was nothing btween him and I. I dno its prolly stupid but its how I feel. Neway at least I meet sum new ppl last nite, overall it was fun even if i didnt pik up which is gd in sum respects. Neway i betta go, i have 2 clean the house.   Cya,  *Lisa*
