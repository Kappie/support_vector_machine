Well so much for positive thinking. It's not like I want to hurt anyone or anything, I just want to play jokes but kinda of mean ones, for my entertainment purposes. I'm prolly gonna go to hell for thinking that way, either that or get some kind of bad karma sent my way.   I hate work, I had the option to leave yesterday but I never did instead I just stayed on the phone all afternoon doing nothing. But now I wish I could go home and sleep today. I'm just tired. But thats prolly due to the depression.  I'm hungry, I want to eat movie nachos. And popcorn. How weird. But I have this huge craving for it.    Why would I want to be with someone who didn't want to be with me?
