It was fun though. Got good seats, didn't we Claire? Muaha.  Did anyone see The O.C. on Wednesday? I'm so pissed! Ryan and Marissa CANNOT break up! NO NO NO! Haha it's pathetic that I am so absorbed in a TV show, but I actually like it more than THe Real World. *GASP* Hehe.  Since I'm lazy... I'll post some lyrics to a very great song.  Wonderwall by Ryan Adams  Today is gonna be the day That they're gonna give it back to you By now you should've somehow Realized what you gotta do I don't believe that anybody Feels the way I do about you now  Backbeat the word is on the street That the fire in your heart is out I'm sure you've heard it all before But you never really had a doubt I don't believe that anybody feels The way I do about you now  And all the roads we have to walk are winding And all the lights that lead the way are blinding There are many things that I would Like to say to you But I don't know how  I said maybe You're gonna be the one who saves me And after all You're my wonderwall  Today was gonna be the day But they'll never bring it back to you By now you should've somehow Realized what you're gotta do I don't believe that anybody Feels the way I do About you now  And all the roads we have to walk are winding And all the lights that lead the way are blinding There are many things that I would like to say to you But I don't know how  I said maybe You're gonna be the one that saves me You're gonna be the one that saves me And after all You're my wonderwall You're my wonderwall You're my wonderwall You're my wonderwall
