They almost ruined what would have been an extremely romantic moment. After dinner somewhere in or near Cape Cod, Garth took me to this little spot in Duxbury where his mother used to take him when he was little. We had to walk down this long path across this grassy field to a cute little rock formation overlooking the water. We had just missed sunset, but it was still gorgeous. We sat down and were attempting to bask in the calmness. But, unfortunately, the bugs had other ideas. They were seriously attacking us. We tried to bat them away, but that didn't really work. After battling the insects for a few minutes, we gave up and decided to wander back to his car.   I almost thought that we had escaped bug bite free. But, unfortunately, the six or seven bug bites on my body prove otherwise. Why do they have to be so itchy and be located in such hard-to-itch spots? I hope Garth fared better than I did.
