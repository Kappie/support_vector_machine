It is when Harry has to put together a defense Aganinst the Dark Arts becasue Proffesor Umbridge didn't want to teach the students defensive spells because she and the ministry of magic think that Proffesor Dumblador wants to make an army to go against the ministry, Dumblador would never want to do that. Anyway so they are not supposed to be making an organization on there own unless they have the consent of Proffesor Umbridge because she is the Inquirior of magic and everything that goes through the school has to go through her first.So they have to find a way to get away with having a class once a week without Umbridge knowing. At the same time that all of this is going on Ron finds out that his sister Ginny is seeing someone hat Ron doesn't like very much but the only reason that he doesn't like him is because he knows Ginny is dating him. Ron is a very protective person and he doesn't want his younger sister dating at such a young age. i told you that it wouldn't seem very interesting to you because you haven't read the entire book. Truthfully I haven't either. HA HA HA HA HA! Anywayz that wasnt suposed to be funny just for your FYI. I really recomend that you read all 5 harry Potter books if you haven't already. I don't think that you should see the movie until you have read the book. The book gives you alot more detail and the movie cuts out like about half of the book. Anyway check back later for up dates on how the book is. BYE!
