I'm guessing that it probably came from pitch fork as farming was common place in the times of our ancestors, but then you have to ask who thought up 'pitch fork'?  Words are strange things, I mean who decided what they meant, who sat round a table and decided that vivisection was to mean dissecting living animals? If no-one had thought of meanings for words, then no-one would be able to understand this, I wouldn't even be able to write it, it would just be sounds, sounds that we used to express feelings, thoughts emotions - and we could only understand that because of the facial expression that acompany them.  But then I supposee you have to wonder how we no that someone has a down turned lip, they aren't happy, or if someone is smiling they are happy! I think possible it's all in our instincts, we can instinctively tell how someone is feeling, maybe that is the remnense of our animalistic side - we know when to back off, when know when to surround and protect...  hmmm  love nat xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
