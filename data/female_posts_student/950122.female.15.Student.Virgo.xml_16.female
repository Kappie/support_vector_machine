I'll try not to transmit gloomy vibes through your screens. n_n    I've been trying to write  something ,  anything  for quite a while now. Nothing's some out. n_n ARGH! I wonder if I'll ever get my character's past right. n_n; I wonder if I'll  ever  get anything right. n_n;;;     ''A little biRdy in the sKy  DroPped A poOpOO in mY eyE.  I didNt Laugh,  I diDnt cry.  I jusT tHanKEd God...      COWS DONT FLY''     I got this off of AC. I found it funny. n_n Here's another one.     "Duct tape is like the force, it has a dark side, it has a light side, and it holds the Universe together."  --Carl Zwanig     I got this off of a blog that's no longer updated. Too bad.    Oh yeah. I bought this manga... Shadow of the Dark River. This is the same manga that made Enid go on a kissing craze... n_n But this is the second volume, so it's got things other that FKs. Hehe. n_n;; I've shown it Gela already, and I think I've gotten her hooked. She wants me to look for the third volume. n_n *shrugs* What can I say?    Oh yeah, I've red streaks in my hair... my mom let me! n_n
