(We didn't have Tostios though)  The computer is action packed with web cam footage (over an hours worth too) and some 50 odd digicam pics.  Shane probably got no sleep thanks to me screaming because of the movie (What Lies Beneath-- Things kept popping out of nowhere!!!), and I will never think the same way about a cell phone ever again ("Ahhh, my crotch is is vibrating!!!).  We had good times, scaring people in their cars as we take 'artsy' pictures on Searidge Rd in the middle of the night, and lying down under a tree and getting something wet in my hair!!  (That was just a little bit grosse!)  So there's me, Amy, Tiffany and Lindy crashing here at Maimes'.  Oh, and did i mention Tiffany's cake from hell.  Or, what was supposed to be a cake.  First off she forgot the baking powder so it was only 1/2 inch high, and it was supposed to be an orange cake, but it tasted an aweful lot like walnuts.  They were crunchy and nutty tasting, but TIff assures me that there was only orange peels in it.  I totally thought that it would kill me.  That was truly interesting.  So we went out side at like midnight or so and we're all running around the road taking pictures and whatnot.  (the pics are on my website)  Then we came home and turned on the webcam and were complete dumbasses for an hour or so.  It t'was good fun.  Anyhoo, more later, I gotta run, theres a line up for Amy's computer.  Late
