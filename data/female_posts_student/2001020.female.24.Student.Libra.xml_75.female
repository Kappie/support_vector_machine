Granted, I went out last night and drank and all went well, but that's because I drove.  I had C with me and there's no way I could let things get out of hand.  But I don't know if I'm driving tonight...I don't know if I want to.  And I'm a little nervous about that.  I am just a little nervous about going out and not having a good time the way I want to have it.  I dunno.  I think too much.  That is obvious to everyone.  But I think after last weekend's episode, I'd better start thinking a little more, wouldn't you say?  Who knows.  Anyone, laterz...I'm gonna finish up some IM conversations and get ready.
