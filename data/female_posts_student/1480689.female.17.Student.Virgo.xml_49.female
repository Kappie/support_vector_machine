It's filled with people who are shopping for their lovers and their friends, saying "I won't ever be lonely again."  Now a forest fenced becomes backyards like songs are born from sound.  And an Apple fell and it taught us all we are chained here to the ground. So, I mean, here we go, but there ain't no escape.  These streets are just dead ends.  So I won't ever be happy again.  Now it seems that you too see a painful blue when you stare into the sky.  You could never understand the movement of a hand waving goodbye.  But as the story goes, or it is often told, a new day will arise and all the dance halls will be full of skeletons that are coming back to life.  And on a grassy hill the Lion will lay down with the Lamb and I won't ever be lonely again.  But until that time I think I had better find some disbelief to suspend, because I don't want to feel like this again.  great song. find out who this is and download all of his work.
