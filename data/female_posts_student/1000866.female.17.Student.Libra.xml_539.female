It's just absolutely hilarious. She bowled ten gutter balls in a row...probably because she was laughing too hard haha, but on one, she swung back and the ball fell and rolled back and....wow, funniest thing I've possibly ever seen. I seriously almost peed my pants.   Wow. Too much was happening there for a while. There were so many people IM'ing me at once with problems and...ahhhh. It was insane. I'm really glad people can come to me but...wow. Things...I think...well..I hope will be ok with Pat. I feel really awful, but I think he understands.   Ah, I think I need to go sleep now. Tomorrow's my last real free day of break. I can do something tomorrow night and that's...it. Then it's all gone. :( Sadness.   OK, I started writing this like...four hours ago. Grrrr. This ALWAYS happens. Oh well. It's all good. I can go to sleep in good conscience now. I talked with Pat and thingss are ok so that makes me happy. :)   Ah, my arm hurts though...and I'm so warm. I think I may have a fever actually...not cool. Heh, literally.   This definitely started as a post for Friday, not Saturday.
