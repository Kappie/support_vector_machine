I'm at Aris's house... i am sitting on the floor b/c jamie and aris are sitting in chairs... we ditched lindsey.. she is sleeping in the other room ... jamie and I are talking to the same person on two different messengers on the same computer.  I will not sleep tonight b/c i was forced to watch the last half of Texas Chainsaw Massacre... this has been a post of really short random sentences (punctuated with ....).  I miss Chicken... chocolate milk would be nice too.  Frizzie Lizzie (do you see that!! it says Frizzie Lizzie... oh simple pleasures)
