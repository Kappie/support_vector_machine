Oh, that's right, here's the big moment you've all been waiting for:                     DANNIE'S GETTING THE HELL OUT OF FLORIDA!!!  So this is the plan...at least for now:             April 12-17th: Kick ass and take names at the National Youth Court Conference in D.C. Kinkos is my new best friend.  I'm about to go make 1000 copies of my various resumes.  :)             May 3-13th: Go to Connecticut and scout out jobs, go to NYC and be the good bridesmaid and get fitted for what I hope will be a tasteful dress...Elyse definitely looked better than me at prom, so hopefully her taste hasn't changed that much in the past 6 years.             July 21st: Elyse's wedding in Long island.  Some time either before or after begin moving my crap into storage somewhere in New England.             July 31st: My lease ends and I leave Gainesville...for good, with the exception of a reunion or two...  Please keep me in your prayers and thoughts, folks.  As of right now, I'm leaving without having a job to go to which is by far the most ballsy, scariest thing I have ever done.  At least I have my parents approval now...even if they can't support me financially (thus, the internet garage sale.)  Pictures of stuff for sale to follow once my digital camera batteries finish charging.  Movin' on up, to the Northeast side....
