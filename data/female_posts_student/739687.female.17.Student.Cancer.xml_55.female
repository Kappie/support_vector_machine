Hmm...what I good question. Because the truth is, I don't know. Now I'm gonna go sit in my room for a few hours trying to answer that question, but getting nowhere. Maybe the answer is 'neither' but rather that I think too much for my own sanity. Indeed I believe that I've solved this mystery! And I am tired, so off to bed it is...au revoir.
