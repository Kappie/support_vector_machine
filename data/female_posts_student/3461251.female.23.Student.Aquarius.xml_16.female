Well not really gone, I keep it in a pony tail to send to  urlLink locks of love , it'll make a child with cancer happy and beable to live a somewhat more normal life.  However, in some werid way my head feels lighter... sheesh, never realized how heavy that dang hair was and not only that I actually don't run out of HOT water when I take a shower due to not having to wash such long hair 2 or 3 times to get it clean.  I now need to get a new picture online of me with shorter hair!!
