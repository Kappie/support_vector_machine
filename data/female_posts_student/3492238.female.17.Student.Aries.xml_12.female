Funny how I find things out about what's going on in my house through Marilyn, who lives in Trenton. Funny how I'm the last one told about things 2 days after they happen. Funny how people leave. Funny how some people don't support others. Funny. Funny how they're never here. Even when they are here, they're still gone. Funny how they wonder why I'm upset. Funny how they don't understand me. Funny how my ankles aren't getting better and constantly keep going out. Funny how there's nothing I can do about it. Funny. Funny how I feel. Alone. Funny how marks drop. Chemistry and how many moles I don't remember. Funny how things work out. Funny how life passes you by. Funny how if you're lucky, second chances do come around. Luck. Funny. Funny how you can't change how people treat you. Funny how I know I can't fix my own problems, and no one else can fix them either. Funny. Problems. Funny how they're always there. Funny how I pretend everything's is fine. Funny how I know I might break down and never get up again. Funny.
