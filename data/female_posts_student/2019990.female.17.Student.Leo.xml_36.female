I was really confused at first.  I think I have a handle on it for now.  Today was so fun, in Sunday School we took the kids out and we blew bubbles.  A little messy with three year olds, but that's what paper towels are for right?  I also got to take a summer nap.  That's where you sleep with the windows open, and it had just rained, and smelled soooo good. So I started my paper on my book for college in the high school for english, and it's already about six hundred words long, and I have discussed three of the ten things I was planning on discussing.  I hope Mr. B. doesn't have a limit for these papers.  It's too bad I can't make conversation like I can write essays.  I'm awesome at ackward silences.  But what can you do?   so for HSOD we are doing a salute to seniors episode, and I was looking through tapes of old tv shows last night, it was fun, I was looking through the Winne-The-Pooh for old comercials, and I found episodes of Alf, and I have come to the conclusion that I was the only child in this county who watched Cheers and Mash on a regular basis, but wasn't allowed to watch The Little Mermaid.  I also found a kindergarten program of the seniors it's so funny.  I remember singing the did you feed my cow? song, and at the end the cow dies and gets eaten by buzzards.  And to show you what a warped child I was that was one of my favorite songs to sing in msuic class.     Tomorrow is our last day of titration.  *tear*  We're hoping for a sucessful titration from Mahinda.  She's been a bit titrationally challeneged as of late.  But it's rather comical to me. She's some what frusterated.     I had best be going though.  I have to finish my Espanol and practice my social report.  Mine is on Marilyn Monroe, the sex goddess of the 1950's, and so much more.  I'm getting nervous though, my class showed their consideration during Leila's presentation.  Wish me luck.
