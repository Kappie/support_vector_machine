Another change will be made...not in a short time. Meanwhile, I'm also trying to costumize my blog. Been trying to remember some of the HTML tags. It's been a while since I made a website. One of the recent site I made was a tribute site to  Francesco Coco , an Italian football/soccer player who plays in   urlLink Internazionale Milan  . Don't bother to check the site. It has 'Under Construction' tag on the main page. Maybe I should be fixing it and run it again. As soon as my modem is repaired (it got hit by lightning one night, didn't blew up just refuses to recognize a dial tone). When? Soon. No actual or acurate answer to be made.  What else? Oh yes, no new report yet from  John Vause . The last one I saw was still the one about the Iraqi traffic police who were trained by British troops to control checkpoint. A short glimpse of Mr. Vause, the rest was just his voice on the report. Ah, better than nothing I guess. I'll try to find the url of his profile from the CNN.com as soon as possible. After I manage to get used to the HTML tags again. I've been using Netscape Composer for a while, that's why I've been neglecting HTML tags. I guess it's better to use the FrontPage...you can still see the HTML tags. But wait a minute, the latest Composer does have HTML view too. Oh well...fix the modem first, fix the modem first. There goes another spending. So when am I going to go back to my piano lesson?  Damn cable!!! Instead of fixing the problem of their subscription with the  STAR TV , they change the damn channel into something that didn't even aired. Then they got two, not one, two TV5 Asie. And they didn't recover RAI International. Damn them! I'm stopping my subscription if they still have this problems next month. I'm changing my cable service next month, if they can't get the STAR TV channels running. Totally not professional.
