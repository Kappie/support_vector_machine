We're mad Spiderman fans! Well... I am... It all started one rainy day... *flashback* (No way is there gonna be a flashback! We don't wanna traumatise people even more than they are already from reading this!) Hey my cat wants a hug... say hey Cleo! Uhuh... so she's gone, I tried to get her to annoy my brother but he's not here... hmm... Oh and I just read a story on fanfiction and every one... kind of died! Woohoo! Happy, happy! That's what it always does in old books! They're all happy at the end, then they all die. I mean great guys, just great! Mmm... any way, I'm writing about Mr Fopple, and yes, I am going weird. Very weird. Oh, I had the weirdest dream! (Uhuh... we  really  wanna hear about it) Ok, ok, so you get off... Eeek! Cleo again! Noooo... stay away... not the tickling! Nooooo!
