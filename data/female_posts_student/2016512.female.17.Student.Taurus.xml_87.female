I'm currently glad for it to be friday, but the fact that tomorrow is saturday ie- ACTs, makes it crapfully crappy all at the same time. I'm procrastinating, as i usually do. i'm supposed to be studying for ACTs, but that doesn't appear to be happening.  i have no current state of mind. i would try to blog, but i'm feeling very neutral. i'm not much for extremes. i think i'm pretty mello or all-round go-with-the-flow type person. does that make me boring? does that make me vapid? do i have a single thought that's my own? or am i eternally brainwashed by the rest of the world. am i a deep person?  ...Goes to Hades, -Betso
