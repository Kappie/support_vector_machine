Voting Official Seeks Terrorism Guidelines Fri Jun 25, 3:59 PM ET By ERICA WERNER, Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON - The government needs to establish guidelines for canceling or rescheduling elections if terrorists strike the United States again, says the chairman of a new federal voting commission. Such guidelines do not currently exist, said DeForest B. Soaries, head of the voting panel.      Ok.......someone besides me has to be saying, "WTF?"   Cancel the elections? You don't cancel the elections! You certainly don't bring up cancelling the elections one month before the primary election! Does this look like a last minute ditch effort on Bush's behalf to stay in office no matter what? How long do we cancel thevoting for? A month? A few? A year? The fact that this actually came out of an officials mouth makes me ill. Back to your regularly scheduled programming.
