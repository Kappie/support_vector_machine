I know that we're supposed to help in the chores and all, but hey, I'm on the computer here, doin somethin extremely important. Well, at least it's important to me!! There's absoulutely nothing wrong with that. Stop bugging me already.       Anyhow, my tests are over for this week! Woohoo. Well actually that's a given since it's Friday. :P. BUT, i've got Biology  Emath tests next tuesday... sigh. Mr Lim said that the test's tough. MUST STUDY tomorrow, after my homework  on Sunday!!       Hairin  Ifah wants me to go along to watch Stepford Wives, didn't want to. Then Ifah just HAD to go send me the trailer, and well, interest has been sparked. Not going though, to risque to spend $8.50 on a 2star movie...  I'll ask 'em how it was, then maybe on Friday I'll watch. Yups, that's what i'll do!!       Anyhow, Ifah said some sweet stuff today, or maybe not. She thinks I'm cynical thats why she likes me. I'm not fake. Am I really cynical? It's suppose to be a not so nice thing, so should I take it as a compliment?!? Oh well, perhaps I am. Why deny it. It's not to bad actually, at least I'm honest, sincere and NOT FAKE.       Oh well, nothing much happened today, at least I can't remember much. I love the song by the way!!       -See Ya s  -          I'm staring at your picture every night      The scent of you still lingers in my mind      I wonder if you're alone and feel alright      And the sun has come out of the clouds           And sometimes when I listen to our song      The night seems so cold and far too long      I wanna call you up cause in the end      I keep writing letters to my garbage can           Lately, feels like I'm going crazy      And baby, come and lay down beside me
