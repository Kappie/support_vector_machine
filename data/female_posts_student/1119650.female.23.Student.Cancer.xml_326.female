I had an absolutely  amazing  weekend.  I got to spend time with ALL of my friends, which really ruled.  Thursday night out at Thirsty Turtle was filled with some really great times with my friends from highschool, some of whom I haven't seen since the summer after graduation, and now most of them have graduated college.  I danced with the upper classmen from varsity football team who wouldn't have (and didn't) give me the time of day in high school and I laughed in their faces and got away with openly mocking them and they were none the wiser.  It was oddly (and in some ways pathetically) empowering.  I think its safe to say they've all jumped the goddamned shark.  Friday: suare at Chez  urlLink Anna  and the  urlLink RF Babies  Mansion.  Anna has a very deck deck.  We swam, we drank frozen appletinis, we saw some fireworks, Anna's house was almost blown up, I got to spend time with my wonderful hubby,  urlLink Patches  (who makes an awesome cd!), the  urlLink Doogster  came out and partied and  urlLink Maria  and I made a whirlpool with everyone in the pool.    Saturday I cooked this delicious orzo with summer vegetable salad to enjoy with my family at our barbeque.  My cookies however, were not so successful, but eh, we'll survive with out all the fat.  Saturday night I went to my friend Megan's house who has a bitchin pool and a waterslide!  (yes, a W A T E R S L I D E !) it ruled.  We chilled, we drank some beers and the new frozen  urlLink Arbor Mist  drinks which were yum.    Finally around 2 am I called it a night only to wake up at 9 the next morning to go to Jones Beach in Long Island with all my girlies.  It was sunny, warm, a perfect day for reading and listening to jazz on the beach.  We got thrown in the ocean, got sand in our bums, but it was absolutely delightful.    :::le sigh::: I can not imagine a more perfect weekend.  (c:  Hope all of you had as great a time as I did.  3
