So much has happened and so many changes have occured but I still came out in one piece. The year started out pretty shitty but it's ending alright. And not just because of Mark. Things with Sara are falling back into place and my relationship with Jasmin is continuing to grow. I've grown apart from a lot of people in the past few months, but maybe I didn't fit in with them as much as I thought I did. Honestly, I don't know who I am. I'm still trying to figure that out, but isn't that half the fun in life? Finding who you are and where you're meant to be? I'll never forget the people who have made my year worthwhile and brought me up when I was down. Sam, Emily, Cristina, Keri, Nicole, Sara, Lindsay, Jasmin, Mark, Ricky and so many more. They mean so much to me but I don't think they'll ever realize it.   To my Sammy ... I love you to bits and to pieces. I'll never forget this year. From the good ol' days of morning ball to the crying and meaningful talks. We've grown apart like nobody's business, but I know that the friendship we've built is stronger than that. For only knowing each other for a year, you've made such a difference in my life and helped me to see who I can be and what I can do. You're a wonderful person, so full of love and energy. All I have to say is, I love you and go get 'em, Tiger! You're gonna do great.  To my Emily ... It's been a great 2 years with you. It all started that one day in the auditorium when I helped you paint those kick ass hills. Who knew that it would turn into one of the greatest friendships of my life? You're so wise and philosophical, always willing to help and one damn smart cookie! I know we haven't talked in a long time and I regret it so much. I hated seeing you leave on Friday without a goodbye. I'm going to miss you so much. Even through our ups and downs you've never failed to addist me when I needed assistance and you've never turned your back on me when I needed you most. I say, watch out Europe 'cause here comes Emily!  To my Sara ... Wow. We have been through so much shit this year. More than most people go through all through out high school, I'd say. Our fights were petty but we still made it through. Nobody is there for me like you are. Nobody listens like you do and nobody can bring a smile to my face the way that you can. You're one in a million and I think that the fact that we're still friends after everything proves that. Maybe our fights were a test of true friendship, or maybe they were just us being dumb. Whichever it was, I think we overcame them pretty damn well. I love you.  To my Jasmin ... I don't know where we stand with each other right now but then again, I don't think a good friendship needs to be defined and labeled. We've been to hell and back this year; part of it was together and part of it was apart. The apart time was hard, but I think that's just what we needed. I was becoming dependent and you were becoming suffocated. I've learned a lot this year about myself and about us but the most important thing I've learned is that you are a great friend and those only come along every so often. Even though you don't talk much, you still listen. Even though you don't cry with me, you're still patient. I couldn't ask for any more. Thanks so much for an awesome year.   To my Nicole ... You're at Murray and I'm at Bedford yet we're still this close . We have the most retarded conversations sometimes, but hey, what are friends for right? I've known you since grade 5, but we didn't really become close friends until recently. I'm thinking the wait was worth it. You're amazing. Always there to listen and give me your two cents. Never condescending or impatient. You know just what to say and when to say it. You've opened my eyes to a lot of things and I'll never forget it. I know I can always count on you in spite of the distance. You've been a great friend and I know there's so much more in store for us in the coming years.  To my Mark ... It's only been a few weeks but you're amazing. You always make me smile and I love being with you. I feel so safe in your arms and like I can really be myself when we're together. I gotten a lot of bad apples in the past but you're something else. You're that good thing I've been waiting for. Trust me, the wait was well worth it. You're more than I could ever ask for in a boyfriend and I don't think you'll ever know how happy you make me. You're understanding and patient, sweet and kind, everything a girl could ever want in a guy. I'm so glad I found you. I feel like the luckiest girl when we're together.   The sadness that comes with the end of a school year is just beginning to sink in now. The thought of possibly never seeing some of these people again scares me. The idea that we'll never be ask close as we once were crushes my heart. This year has been by far one of the best ever for me. In some ways though, it's also been the shittiest. I've changed and grown a lot this year and I'm at a place where I'm happy with me and my surroundings (minus the leaving friends). Things won't stay like this forever, but I'm going to enjoy it while I can. Again, thanks to everyone who's made this year one to remember. I'll never forget you. And to those who will be around for a little while longer, I love you and I wouldn't pick anyone else to face the future with!
