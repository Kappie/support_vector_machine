I don't know what triggers this dramatic change, but it sucks. I get like this whenever I PMS, and I know that's what's happening this time. But other times, it's just too much and I don't know what to do. So I do what makes me feel better. I know what I do is wrong, but I don't know any other way. I hate how this feeling can come into my life and completely take over, causing me to do things I wouldn't normally do.   I'm so confused and lost in this endless cycle. Endless cycle; there's a redundant statement. Anyway, I don't know what to do here. I need help, but who can help me? Nobody knows what I'm going through. The best they can do is listen. And then there's Mark. What do I do about him? I'm so happy when we're together and I'm so completely in lust with this guy and he shouldn't have to put up with me and my lack of emotional stability. I don't want to lose him, I don't want to let him go but I don't want to keep him either. Not if what I can't deal with is going to ruin our relationship. Please help me ... somebody!
