The front side is just a lip collage, nothing special, but definitely better than stupid pictures of friends or something. Seriously, people. That's not creative. Anyway, the back is just plain white paper that I packing-taped over so it's like a dry erase board. I'll take a couple sets of markers. I know I could just say, WRITE on it, but it's a composition book, first, and second, I HATE WRITING ON THINGS. It never looks right when I do it, so I just don't touch it. Besides, this lets me change what it says. But it would have been way cooler to let this one go on with just the lips, and done the whiteboard thing on another one. Oh well. It's still OK.  Right now, the notebook reads: "Because I'd rather not talk about your dead exboyfriends over coffee." I love Harry and the Potters.
