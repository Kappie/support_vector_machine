For those of you out there who are fortunate enough to never have worked in a library, shelf reading is giong through shelves upon shelves making sure everthing is in order. It's like reading a phone book and making sure Jones comes before Miller. For two and a half hours. I was damn close to taking a flying leap out the window. But as it was only a first floor and I would probably only end up with a scraped knee, I decided against it.
