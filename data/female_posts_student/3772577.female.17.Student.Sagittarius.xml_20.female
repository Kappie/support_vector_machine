Anyway we lured him inside with coffee, and he managed to sit relatively still and grumpyless for a few hours....across from my mom which was even more amazing. Those two haven't been able to talk until a few years ago, and today they sat across the table from each other for upwards of an hour. We bummed around town for the whole day, Farmer's Market, China Cup, etc. When he lived here and I was Daddy's little girl, we always went to the pony club. He doesn't know what The Horse's death did to me and so we went there today. That's the closest to horses I've been in....9 months. That was sort of painful but more..exhilirating, maybe in a good way, maybe not. I don't really know. I want to ride sooooooo bad, it burns me up inside, burns, hurt,pain, tears, fuel, smell, betray, hear, hooprint, sawdust, hay, swish tail, gallop, drum, heart, tear, pain. It felt weird as always to be with Father Dear. The Familiar Stranger. The man I miss who isnt' the man I miss. I introduced him to M and Murray. That felt weird too. Murray and him talking; my two fathers. So to speak. Murray looked long and hard at me in that way of his.   I finally went to sna this weekend. Hour long instead of the 2 hours of yesteryear but better than missing it again. Saw mike-The Beard. How I miss that man. Rafiki wasn't there, but I hung out with Stino the whole time. She's having a "love" dilemma with Paul which I can't really help her with; I already went through a "love" thing with him. We had a bunch of time afterwards adn couldn't make up our minds as to what to do. Stino came up with the brilliant idea of...'let's go skinny dipping!!" All gung-ho (tehe) for that...except where? Nechako by the bridge is too shallow and people on the bridge can see, which you know I don't mind seeing as they will only see flashes of white in the dark, but still waht if some adventourous boys come down to see. Nope. Fraser? No. Current and where and ....it's not gonna work is it? no no it's not. We're not gonna see each other till september, so we've made it a date. Although that's gonna be bloody  cold.  Should be fun.   Anyway I am tired and kinda sad, just watched Frankie  Johnny, still confused about me and M and all that involves, and... 12 more sleeps till Ireland!!!
