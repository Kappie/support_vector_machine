Even at Jeff's horrible puns that make no sense...  Today was good.  The headshots went well... Everyone was just standing in the auditorium while pictures we being taken on stage. We were all just talking and being goofy... Fun stuff...  ....I want to go to state's so badly so that I can spend three entire days with those silly folk...  ..Spring break starts Wednesday. Joy :)   ...Today seems like Friday. Oh, how I wish it was....
