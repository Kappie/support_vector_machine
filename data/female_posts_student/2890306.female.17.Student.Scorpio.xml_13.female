Everyone has different (and usually multiple) definitions of happiness, so why not share one or two?  Post a comment finishing the sentence "Happiness is..."  It'll be fun, I promise, and you'll be in a better mood when you're done reminiscing.  What more could one ask for?  *smile*  I'll start with a couple of my own:   1.   Being in love.  2.   Waking up on a warm Saturday, knowing you have no plans for the day.
