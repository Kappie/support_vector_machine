Today, she sits down and says "i wanna go home" and "i miss my mommy and daddy".  I stand there (like an anal-retentive and meticulous--  whoops, sorry Jason) and I just ignore her.  Finally she stands up and screams and starts crying...  Then she runs in the girls bathroom and wails like a whore!  MY GOD, I WAS SO PISSED! Jason:  Yikes, I would be pissed @ Burnside.  But, since we all know that she is  right ...  I wouldn't take too much offense.  Maggie put it best when she told me: THE TRUTH HURTS, SORRY (actually she never said that, but it would have been placed well in some of our ol  d conversations).  You should feel lucky, Ms. Burnside speaks in Yiddish with me, I feel so violated. Ryan:  Not all fat people are bad...  Me... um... er...  Okay, maybe fat people are mean, but hey!  They are fat!  You'd be a dick too if you got a chub on when you heard the opening of a McDonald's wrapper.   Oh yeah, don't blaim your gay swimming crap on Liberals, I guarantee we aren't to blaim.  Tomorrow:  I thought some people were going to the mall to get presents for a few Birthday girls?  If we aren't I don't mind, but I don't want JOHNNY ROCKETS...  It is too expensive and I think it is particularly vulgar.  I just want to go someplace  close ,  cheap , and  big enough  to accomodate a lot of us. With that crap said I am going to do my Newspaper article...  I hate newspaper's final, may it never bother me again, ever!  Oh yeah, Laura a embrasse Brian.  Nous avons embrasson huit-temps!  Elle est une rose pantalon!  J/K
