His name is Joey (Not Joey Brown from our school).  I checked out his blog and it's really quite amusing.  Ah, that truly made my day.  There's nothing better than someone you don't know that coincidentally stumbles on your page and acknowledges your work (oh, wait.  I hate work...well, blogging's the only kind of work i like).  I saw this really funny animation thing on his blog.  I laughed so hard i broke all my furniture.     You should check his blog, it's http://joeyeng.myftp.org/blog/
