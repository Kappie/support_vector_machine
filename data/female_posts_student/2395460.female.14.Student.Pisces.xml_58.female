He's sold more than 50 now, and made over $1000. He hopes to make enough to buy an Audi. After that, hopefully he'll get a driver's license.  I was as excited as anyone when the Gmail announcement was made, but after using the service for a couple months now (username  miakim ), my ardor has waned a good deal. Unless you're a fan of web-only mail, it's a bit of a pain to keep track of, and the threaded organization (into "conversations", like on Usenet) is sometimes as confusing as it is helpful. The 1 gig of storage is nice, but unless you never download your mail locally, even the 10-50mb limits that are commonly offered by most ISPs are likely to be sufficient for most users. If you're still longing for the extra space and can't wait for Gmail to become public, there are alternatives. My main account these days is with  urlLink Fusemail , which offers 100mb IMAP accounts for $20 a year but you can buy up to 2GB of storage ($14.99 a month). They offer a free 30-day trial. A friend just pointed out   urlLink AventureMail , which offers  2 GB Free Storage . AventureMail is definitely gunning for Gmail, as they state several times that they will NEVER use ads, which means of course, that at some point their service will not be free. It's also webmail only at this point.   Read more about the  urlLink the Gmail pimp .
