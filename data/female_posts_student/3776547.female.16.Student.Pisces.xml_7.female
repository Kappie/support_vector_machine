The reason we went was to see the movie Sleep Over becasue Renne and Janna's freinds are in the movie they are the bad that plays at the dance in the movie. Everone should go see that movie the movie is cheeseie but the band ROCKS!  I am going to be able to see them at Worped Tour!  Then Saturday we swam for a bit in Janna's pool. Then went to the mall.  Then we went to State College. We went and saw a free concert!  OMG we saw Lit!  The bass player thew a pic at Jana and she totally missed that he did that so I picked it up and gave it to her. And her thew one for Renee. And at the end of the concert he thew me Janna and Renee all pins. Well it was a fun weekend but damn am I tired so I think I am gonna go take a nap!  We did not get home until 4am and then this moring we drove home so I am so tired!  I dont know when I will be able to post again because once again I am at my Dads for the week.  But when I can sneek up here I will post as much as I can!
