Yup! :D Well... these little green men came onto the page and ripped it out leaving a massive hole, they then took it deep into the depths of the internet where they probed it for information on walabys (come on stick with it even if it is pointless and has crap spelling) Aha, but their's no hole in the page you see? Well, what happened is a pink bunny came along and looked at the hole, it then proceeded to jump in the hole so the hole was gone! However the pink bunny wasn't big enough so a load of termites came along and force fed it pumpkins. They then sped up time and the bunny filled the gap, then a big lasar shot the bunny and the hole completely disappeared! :O! Poor bunny! (Geez I'm weird) Sorry, haven't taken my pills today! Bubi!
