You are free to write about anything that you like.. I just need the first one by next Saturday so I'll have time to put the site together.. Hopefully our host Fateback won't be down so much.  I'll also need a 100 x 100 pixel headshot that we can use for your byline.  Vince has already given me his.  We'll try to put the first one together and then see how it goes.  I figure we'll just wing it and learn from each issue.  What do you all think?
