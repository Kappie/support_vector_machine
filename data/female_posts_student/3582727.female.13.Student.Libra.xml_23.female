Well, that's not true--a couple close friends probably will, and I know that the occasional random stranger will probably stumble upon it. But now I'm going to stop writing about writing. Ah, I'm so terrible at this.  I really don't have much of anything to say right now. See this as an introduction to my blog, and expect slightly more interesting entries in the future. Right now I'm having trouble properly controlling my brain. Don't you hate it when that happens?  Well, I think I'll take a leaf out of my friend  urlLink Kate's  book and add some random current things at the end of each entry. Maybe not each entry. Maybe weekly, or something. So anyway...  Current... Favorite color: Green, mostly because I've recently discovered a new appreciation for nature. New good CD: Fefe Dobson. It's not really new, but I just started listening to it. Favorite place to be: Bever Park, probably. Most people go there for the pool...but I prefer the children's zoo and the swingset.  Reading: Actually, nothing. If anyone has recommendations, let me know. Mood: Lazy yet restless...it's a rather frustrating mood.  Well, that's all for now. Leave me some comments. Or don't. I don't really care either way.
