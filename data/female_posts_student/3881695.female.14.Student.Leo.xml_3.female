Well, that's more of a drink, but it's kind of food so yeah. Im hungry.  We are on school holidays now, and there normal. I stay home for most of the week and then I get to go out wif friends on da weekend and my mum takes me places on Friday and Thursday. So it's all good.  Oh and uhm...I saw Shrek 2 today. It was SO FUNNY! I loved Donkey (As always) and Puss....In BOOTS! He was soooooo cute! I also saw Mean Girls and New York Minute on Thursday. I liked mean girls, it was funny and it kind of shows how some peoples lifes are...like the teasing and the popular kids. New York Minute was cool to, I liked there NY clothes, especially  the skirt! It was so kewlies! Yeah, so I like all 3 of those movies.  Dan read my other thingy...where I said....-coughs- what I said. It was freaky. I was scared. But he said it was kool. SEE! He is such a totally awsome guy and he has long-ish black hair. I love it, I also love how he dresses all goth to scare people, it's funny. I have really great friends, Like Dan and Delon....there like some of my best mates..and there kind of protective I quess you can say...when you get them in the right mood. Like, they don't like seing us upset (Us meaning there friends) and they will do anything to stop it.  I have great girlfriends to.
