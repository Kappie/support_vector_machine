If you want to listen to other's advice that is your decision.  As for me I will trust  you , and if you trust him, i will too.    Rosie, i think you need to take the advice giving course again.  The best way to make someone do what you want them to do is not to attack them and cause them to defend themselves from you.  Additionally, that method causes people who might be on your side to back off.  Just step back and don't get emotionally involved.
