Does a clean house indicate that there is a broken computer in it?  -Most likely   Why do people constantly return to the refrigerator with the hopes  that something new to eat will have materialized?  -Oh My God!  I do this  all  the time.   Why do people keep running over a string a dozen times with their vacuum cleaner, then reach down, pick it up, examine it, then put it down to give their vacuum one more chance?  -Damn Lazy People    In winter, why do we try to keep the house as warm as it was in summer when we complained about the heat?  -Ain't that the truth!!   Why is it that men can react to broken bones as 'just a sprain' and deep wounds as 'just a scratch', but when they get the sniffles they are deathly ill 'with the flu' and have to be bedridden for weeks?  -Because men are babies....  Mike, Evan, Kasey, Stephen-you guys are OK by me.   :-)  Everyone else, you know who you are.
