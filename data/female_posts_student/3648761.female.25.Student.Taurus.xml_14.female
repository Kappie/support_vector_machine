This Saturday at 1pm, my sister from florida is comming for a visit. Hany, I love Hany. The only thing that sucks when all three sister get together is that two of us always gang up on one another. And at first the two of them will gang up on me becaus I am the youngest and the Hany and I will gang up on Sady because she is the oldest/says stupid shit sometimes. We always give her shit that she will get old and ugly first.  Then something will happen where we will all fight against each other or all together against someone else.  It always happens , in a two-three day period, en0ugh drama for the year. It'll be nice to see my sister Hany again, and it'll be espically nice for all of of to be togethe again. My sister Hany is bringing me some really nice Chanel glasses. I am totally excited about that. On Sunday we are all getting pierced together. NO matter how old you get you can never out grow your sisters.
