I'd really like your comments, Katie and Jessica, the people who read this about maybe what I should do. I don't know....And I don't care anymore if she's going to read this. I really don't. Who says I cannot express my feelings completly open if she insited everytime to tell me what she had to say through a livejournal comment publicly? Anyways I don't know if I want to continue going to youth group this year. I went to youth group last year mainly because Cathy was there and after awhile I got to know some of the people and they were all really cool people. I didn't really make any real connections with anyone, but I thought they were all cool and interesting none the less. So youth group I guess is going to start again, and I don't know what to do. To go there would be awkward with Cathy but I guess I would get to see all the other people. I am not sure though what they really thought of me, if they really did like me or not. It's not I ever hung out with them or talked to them outside of youth group. And I don't know if I would feel right going there. I mean, the whole reason I went is because Cathy invited me, if I was to go, I'd feel bad because the whole reason why I am there is because someone who doesn't consider me a friend invited me there. Like I'd feel more or less unwanted. The whole reason I was there was because of Cathy and now since of all this I am not sure if it's appropriate for me to come. Sure, she said it's fine and everyones welcomed but I don't know if that's really true. I am already an outcast on so much and I really don't want to become even the outcast of a youth group. So I am not sure if I should even bother. All the pain and saddness from this whole experience is still with me. Some of it has faded but the majority of it is still there. I dont know. I mean, I've lost friends, who hasn't, but I've never lost one so abrubtly. Like that final conversation. That was it. The End to the friendship. It was all over in a matter of minutes. And that friendship had meant a lot to me, considering it's really hard for me to make friends here. I just feel so stupid. I told her so much about me, more than I've told some people I've known my whole lives, and it's all just wasted. And what hurts the most is that she can do that and be fine. I almost feel like that time we were friends meant absloutly nothing to her, she can blow if off as easily as it started. Or maybe I'm just being stupid about all of this. And I'm too sensitive and I'm blowing it out of proportion. Like I always do I guess. I still have that list she wrote on my livejournal about all my faults and I can't get them out of my head, everytime I feel like crieing now I think "God Kate your so stupid and overreacting again." Fuck Star. Anything I gained from that experience, I lost double. Just Fuck it.  "Don't attempt to cut yourself with a dull pair of scissors a hundred times.".....Don't worry, I won't. It's not even worth it.
