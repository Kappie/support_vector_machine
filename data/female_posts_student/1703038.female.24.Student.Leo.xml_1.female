       
      I ran 1/3 of a mile and fastwalked a 1/3 of a mile back before the rains hit.  I sorta wanted to barf when I got done but at least the shin splints and the seeing black didn't happen.  I guess not too bad for the first exercise break in two years of inactivity.  Still, not too good either in a general sense.  Oh well, baby steps to acceptable health levels.
