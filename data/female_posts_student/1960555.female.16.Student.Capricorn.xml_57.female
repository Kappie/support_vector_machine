These are just a few of my new musical obsessions.    Junior Senior:  Quality music here, Beach Boys meets dance pop-punk. Move your Feet rocks.  Divit:  No Regrets, William, Missunderstanding Maybe, all really good songs.  Maimes found them on a random music search, and I gotta say, I like 'em.    Catch 22:   Imagin Sublime and Mest having a love child.  This is what you'd get.    Mest:   Speaking of, these guys are a great punkrock band from Chicago.  I'm a big fan, they're excellent live and on their albums.  You can't go wrong when you're mest.   Fenix Tx:   Not quite as underground, or what ever you might call it, as the others, but not as well known as they should be.  Threesome is a hilarious song, just listen to the words kids.    Story of the Year:   I love these guys!  Their CD is about stuff that everyone goes through or can relate to.  Their not everyones kind of music, but the message is universal.    A.D.D. MOMENT::   Ghandi has A.D.D! Ghandi has A.D.D! You get it from toilet seats, Use protective sheets! (Clone high rocks my socks!!!)
