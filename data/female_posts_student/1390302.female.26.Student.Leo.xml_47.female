Those who deny individual rights, cannot claim to be defenders of minorities." ~Ayn Rand    While watching  urlLink MSNBC  yesterday morning I was shocked to hear that a woman, Amina Lawal, had been sentenced to be stoned to death in Nigeria in March of 2002, following the birth of her daughter two years after divorcing her husband.  Apparently, Lawal has sex out of wedlock and was convicted of this act as a crime by Islamic courts.  What struck me strange was that this woman pled guilty to this “crime.”  Lawal said that the man she engaged in sexually agreed to marry her, he was brought up on charges, denied it, and was acquitted for lack of proof.  I suppose that if they are so barbaric that they stone human beings to death they wouldn’t have this little thing called DNA testing.    If the sentence had been carried out, the 32-year-old would have been the first woman stoned to death since 12 northern states first began adopting strict Islamic law, or Shariah, in 1999.   On reading further into the matter, I found that several men in this country have said that they would “gladly” carry out the stoning themselves believing the overturning of her sentencing to be a violation of the Quran. Many in Katsina, Nigeria have renounced the sentence, believing it lawful to stone this woman to death.  Apparently they believe that such acts discourage “crime.” Several other women and a pair of lovers have also been sentenced to death; all but the pair of lovers have been acquitted.    So I have to wonder how the word “crime” is defined in other countries?  In America, a “Crime” is defined as a wrong doing against society as a whole.  A wrong doing in which punishment can be sought as compensation for the wrongdoing. In America a crime is punishable by fine, imprisonment, and occasionally, under extreme circumstances, death.  Now I have to make a side note in saying that I am for the death sentence in America.  I believe that it is just punishment for horrible crimes, yet this is a top all of its own for another time.    Stoning a woman to death for being human is unreasonable and irresponsible in my opinion.  Stoning any person to death for such a “crime” is irrational.  I can admit that there are those religions where such acts are not only accepted by also encouraged.  Still, Nigeria has ratified international treaties banning torture.  Lawal’s defense used this treaty as leverage, I would have to say that I agree that stoning a person to death is torture.    However, in reading over all this terrible injustice, I have found a ray of hope.  An Islamic court has overturned her conviction.  While I believe that the grounds for dismissal should have been outrage and disgust at the way a human being was going to be brutally killed, they overturned it saying that she didn’t have enough chance to defend herself.  Either way, it was overturned.  I only wonder how this woman will get by in a society that feels that she has escaped the justice of religion?  ~Kristyn
