Still having not decided what to do with Mystery Tank #5 V 1.0 and not wanting to touch Mystery Tank #4, I started a new project.  Socks.  Again.  Sock, really.   urlLink Quit it with the words! .  Not wanting to spend particularly long on this, either, I'm using a heavier gauge yarn.  Meh, they'll be good for the three weeks of winter. "They"?  As if I'd do more than one. ;)  I really would rather be doing another felted bag, but I don't have much wool around here.  Just the leftovers from the last two bags - it'd take some braining to figure out how to use the different yarns, and I'm still under the impression it's a very bad idea to leave me alone with me.     So, flamingo picture.  I really ought to get off my duff and get meself a photobucket account rather than hotlinking off Geocities.
