But Ireland doesn't really mean anything to me. I'd be going to go with friends and to say I've been to Europe. But, then I'm half planning a trip to Tokyo, which is where I'd really love to go. It would be alone and in the big city, but I suppose I'd have to get used to it sometime.  But there are SO MANY CHOICES!!!!!!!!!!  Too many.  I have to decide whether I'd like a nice hotel and stay fewer days or a scary one and stay longer.  Or could I perhaps go to Okinawa cheaper?  I'm not sure, but I'll have to look it up now that I've thought of it. I should just go to Ireland, but I REALLY want this Japan thing and it would offer me a chance to sort of get in touch with my Asian roots.  I haven't ever really had any contact with that many other Asians.  But then again, Ireland is cheaper.  Oh well, I will go somewhere either way, so I suppose it shouldn't matter that much.  I have all my life to travel the world, and since that's what I plan on doing anyway, I think it could work out just fine any way I go.  So, anyway, my parakeet Sonny died today.  Or last night. I'm not sure.  It made me really sad, because I hadn't even looked at it the day before.  I felt bad that I didn't just glance at it. I remember hearing it moving its toys, but never looking at it, and now all I can remember is how it looked when I found it on the bottom of the cage this morning.  But I'm trying not to dwell on the sad things today. I'm not going to allow myself to do that.  It's abnormally cold out today.   I actually shivered just now.  It was 50 degrees this morning, and this is Cape Girardeau here!  We're ususally really hot out this time of year.  So I'm thinking about finding a sweatshirt or something to wear right about now, but I'm too lazy to get up and do it.  Curse these lazy whims of mine!  I need to be wrapped up in a blanket or something.  Oh well, I will write again today, probably several times. I'm one of those people who never run out of things to say.  'Til then. . . .    See you space cowboy. . . . @>---
