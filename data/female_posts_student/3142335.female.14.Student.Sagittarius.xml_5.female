It all started at church tonight with this GREAT message and it really spoke to me adn made me think about sooooooo many things and I realized alot fo areas in my life that have GOT to change! adn then afterwards I got home and got on the internet of course and I started takling to a friend of mine and she's going through one of the suckiest times right now so please help me just pray for her that things will get better but one of the things that made me feel so good was that I was able to reach out to her adn make her feel better as a person just letting her know that I was ALWAYS going to be here for her and I think that's what alot of people these days lack...I mean my 7th grade year sucked jsut how hers had and then I finally founda couple of people that I could confide in adn my life got so much better..but please just pray for her............but anyways now to one of the greatest guys in my life!!!!!
