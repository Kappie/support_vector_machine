Happy...in that "the world doesn't owe me anything" way. right now. which...is a very different feeling compared to regular happy. its better. and maybe you dont know what im talking about... but its a much more complete, rejuvinating happiness than happiness when you still feel like "life is unfair". you know? i dunno... but happy. in just about the best way possible.  Scared... because this vacation means summer's almost over. And when summer's over... I don't get to see Emily anymore. And i don't want to not see Emily anymore and i don't want to go crazy and i don't want to...hurt.  Worried/sad that i won't get an airplane note and...much more importantly...that i won't get to see Emily again before school/right after school starts. sometime around there. Which i want. So i can freak out on her and tell her im scared and hug her. hard. and a lot. and tell her i love her and hopefully she'll say something encouraging, but even if she doesnt...just telling her everything im afraid of and how much i loved this summer and how important to me it is to stay good friends and... and... everything. in person. and before anything really happens yet. just to tell her that would be comforting. and to hug her. she doesnt have to say anything. just...come...and listen...and hug me. even if she never said anything the entire time i would still feel much better afterwards. i would. And i was afraid...a little while ago... that i couldn't talk about it without crying... but... you know what? i dont care if i cry. she can see me cry. i dont have anything to hide from her. if anything, maybe the image would stick with her and...i dunno...shed be less inclined to make decissions that would result in me being sad and missing her? i dunno... something like that.  we'll see though. but im thinking maybe ill get a my good chance to hug the life out of her. and that would be nice.  ..... BUT.... i'll never get any of that if i don't  get to see her the first week of school. or around that time frame. so im worried about that.  i guess those two are kinda the same but theres the BIG FEAR and then tehres the fear i wont get to have a little more fun and comfort before THE BIG FEAR. ha... if that makes any sense at all. it doesnt even make sense to me...really...  amused... cause im talking to julie right now. and yelling at her.  heatherless...cause shes in EUROPE. ive been missing heather this summer. i love you heather!  anxious about all that homework i havent done... damn you school! *shakes fist*  the is the first time i have ever dreaded school soooooooooooooooooooo much. freshman year i dreaded it a lot... but im thinking this time its more because junior year is crappy and freshman year...well...i dunno. i take that back. this year and freshman year were the worst. i dont know which was worse. they both go back to essensially the same basic fear though... which is interesting... but im crazy dreading school.  and... i dunno. more stuff. but i need to pack for vacation so ill quickly talk about 6 flags.  we went to great america yesterday. me and emily and jenna and caitlin and kara. everyone (woodlonians) else was busy/on vacation. Marthas probably mad cause she wanted us to go with her this weekend, but im gonna be gone and karas working and emily couldnt today cause of taking jenna home...and... craziness. poor martha, but oh well. i got my great america. so yay.  jennas mom was mean though. cause she said emily could drive jenna, and then the night before she changes her mind. whats up with that? so mrs. pasch had to drive us there and my dad drove us back. less fun. but i still had a blast.  we talked about sex, drugs, and violence. i poked emily in her birth defect and called her a whore for wearing a shirt that was kinda short so you could see a very small part of her stomach. shes not a whore though. she's a good kid. and...i met jenna. shes cool. emily and jenna have the same laugh...except jennas is deeper, louder, and more evil. but they're very similar. and the quote of the night was when me, jenna, and emily (seated in that order) were on raging bull in the front row going up the thing before the big drop and i yell over to emily "we're still at war!" (i had declared war on her earlier) and she yells back "I am  not  a whore!" hahaha. you kinda had to be there or at least know who emily is (as decided at lunch today, pang). but it was hillarious. and.... i wore my sandals. which was stupid. but oh well. and.... cait and i had a blast while everyone else rode giant drop. aaaand...hmmm... i dunno. i could write more but my mom's hassling me to pack. so i should. i'll type more from tucson/LA
