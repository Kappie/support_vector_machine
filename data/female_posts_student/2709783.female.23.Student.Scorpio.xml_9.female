As a bit of introduction, my dad and I actually get along well, because we both hate confrontation, so our conversations are those of people who know each other a little and are catching up.  Talking to my stepmother is like having lunch with Linda Tripp.  She's very sweet and nice, but the whole time you feel like she's gathering information to use against you at your federal deposition.  Parts of the conversation where an offer of financial aid or family-sponsored travel could easily be extended are in bold.  After gushing greetings and hugs, with comments on both sides about how great we all look:  Stepmom:  So, when you go to law school, will that be full-time?  Me:  Yes.  Stepmom: [not because she cares, but because] my health insurance will let me keep you on for free as long as you're full-time.  Great!  [Now she don't feel so guilty about spending my college fund on vacations and luxury vehicles!]  Dad:  Are you still wait-listed at Arizona?  Isn't that where you really want to go?  Me:   Yes, but I've put down so many deposits at Kansas that I'm not sure I could afford to switch this late in the game.  Even though I'd love to attend Arizona, and it's a better law school and much more suited to the type of law I want to practice.   Awkward silence.  SM:  So, your Dad and I are going to Ruidoso this weekend!  Me:  Wow!  That sounds like fun.  Dad:  Yeah, you know, we went skiing five or six times last winter and the house [that belongs to his crooked lawyer friend] is so great, we just can't stay away!  SM:  Well, she knows that.  Randa's been to the house, Dad.  Haven't you?  Me:  No.  [I've been invited twice in six years, both times at New Year's Eve, a holiday I cannot imagine spending cooped up with people who don't really like me.]  SM:  Oh, I thought you had.  You'll have to go with us one weekend.  I'm sure you already have plans for the 4th, or I'd ask you to come this time.    Me: [I almost said I didn't have plans, just for fun, but let it drop]  That sounds great!   Dad: [smoothly almost changing the subject]  I'm just glad that we can drive to Ruidoso.  I don't think I'll ever be comfortable flying.  But you do see some interesting people on airplanes.  Remember when we took Randa's little brother and all of his buddies to Las Vegas?  I sat by Pat Knight, Bobby Knight's little brother.    Me:   That's awesome.  I've never been to Vegas, but it's on my list of places to visit.   SM:  Oh, you'd love it.  We had so much fun,  we're going back again later this year .  Dad:   After we take that cruise .  ...  Later, the conversation shifted to my personal life.  SM:  So, are you still dating Terry?  Me:  No, we split up.  [No further information was offered because this is not a subject I want to discuss.]  SM:  Oh, what happened?  Me:  Um, we just didn't work out.  SM:  Was it because you're going to law school far away?  Me:  Um, partly, I guess.  [at this point I'm not making eye contact and am trying to remember all of the body language I know for "not a conversation I want to pursue"]  SM:  But I bet you guys are still friends, right?  Me:  [we're not, but if I say yes maybe she'll stop]  Uh-huh.  SM:  You two weren't really that serious anyway.  [We dated exclusively for over two years.  I thought we would get married eventually.]  Me:  No, not really [desperately thinking of something else to talk about].  SM:  Well, cousin one's husband is working on his doctorate at U of Georgia, since he's some engineering boy genius, and cousin two's husband is wildly successful at whatever he does, and cousin three's husband is taking her to Paris for ten days, and cousin four is dating an incredibly handsome athlete, and cousin five...  Me:  How wonderful for all of them.  [remembering why I came.]  Hey Dad, want your Father's Day gift?  Dad:  Sure!    [I present the cigars, to many appreciative noises.  At least that part was a success.  Unfortunately, it inspired another travel story.]  SM:  You know, I tried to bring in some rum from [some Caribbean island] and they wouldn't let me!  They said you could only have a liter!  Me:  I think that's all you can transport, but just don't declare it next time.  SM:  Well, that's what I did last time, when we went down to Old Mexico.  The shopping down there was *not* what I expected, ewwww. [apparently, she thought Del Rio was Spanish for Saks Fifth Avenue].  Me:  It's definitely a niche market.  You know, pottery, handmade glassware, silver jewelry.  SM:  Dad, are you going to take Randa to see your mom [who hates me and is the reason I changed my last name]?  Dad:  Ummm [he knows this is not a good idea], I'm not sure if they're home.  SM:  Well, just go over there and leave a note if they're not home.  Dad:  [looking nervously at me]  I guess we can do that.  We won't stay long, I've got to get to [somewhere he made up].  Me:  Sure, I'd love to see her.  We drive the four blocks to his mother's house.  Effusive greetings.  For some reason, my ex-grandmother decides to pick on my dad instead of me.  A big reason I refer to her as such is because she thinks my parents were never married, since they didn't have a Catholic wedding, and I am therefore illegitimate (they were married almost two years before I came along, so unless I am a pachyderm, I'm pretty sure I was conceived in wedlock).  Also, did I mention she's very Catholic?  Catholicism is one of the denominations which I actually appreciate, but I have a big problem w/ the Church's stances on reproductive rights and therefore couldn't convert to please this crazy lady.    [Basic law school discussion, then:]  Dad:  Well, you're wanting to prosecute, right?  Me:  Yes, that's the best way to get courtroom experience and make contacts right out of law school.  I might not have a Lexus for a few years, because you don't make a lot of money at the DA's office, but that's okay.  Dad:  Well, I have a Lexus and I didn't have to go to law school!  GM:  That's because you only have two children.  We had six kids.  [Yes, I think my dad is aware of how many siblings he has.]  Dad:  I didn't want any more kids.  GM:  No, you wanted a Lexus.  [Actually, SM wanted the Lexus.  Dad is a Chevrolet man.]  Dad:  Um, yeah, I guess so.    GM:  [for good measure] We chose to have a big family instead of nice cars. [Did I mention she's Catholic?]  Awkward silence.  Me, to Grandad:  How do you think Stenholm's going to do?  Conversation about Charlie Stenholm's re-election chances in District 17.  Approval of our Congressman is one thing I share with my dad's parents.  Just as my grandfather and I get fairly involved in our political conversation:  GM:  Who's seen  The Notebook ? [unable to not be the center of attention, she rambles about the latest Nicolas Sparks bestseller-turned-movie.]  Conversation turns to politics of guns and Michael Moore.  Me:  I really didn't like Bowling for Columbine.  GD:  No, I don't like Michael Moore.  His methods bother me.    Me:  Did you know Kansas doesn't allow concealed carry?  I'm not sure what I'll do about carrying my pistol--it's either break the law or be unarmed.  GM:  Well, have you ever had to use your handgun?  Me:  No, GM, I've never shot anyone.  GM:  Oh, that's not what I meant [said as if that's exactly what she meant].  Just, do you really think you need it?  Me:  Well, the point of having one is that you hope you never need it, but if you should, it's there.    GM:  [authoritatively]  If you're going to be a LAWyer, I guess you out to obey the LAW.    Me:  [bites tongue]  Dad:  So, how was your latest trip?  [they have a giant RV that they take all of the grandchildren except me on cross-country trips in].  Conversation about trip to the nation's capital.  Dad, mercifully, cut the visit fairly short.  We part ways in the driveway. ---------------- After reading all of this, I think a little clarification is in order.  My relationship with my father has always been weird, and it's honestly both of our faults.  I never made a real effort to get to know him or be the kind of daughter he wanted when I was younger, and he never made a real effort to be around or get to know what kind of daughter I actually was.  We were--and still are--very "Cat's in the Cradle."  I found it impossible to have no relationship with him at all, because he wasn't a "bad" father--he wasn't a drug addict, always paid child support, pillar of the community, etc.  He just wasn't there.    He has made some mistakes that are unforgivable, in my mind, and for that I want to hate him, but he's not inherently a bad person, and for that reason I can't.  Plus, he's half of my genetic makeup, and the older I get the more I spot traits of his (good and bad) in myself.  So I spend my time alternating between feelings of ambivalence and/or resentment of the situation and feelings of intense loyalty and protectiveness.  My stepmother is younger than him, and he is husband #3 for her (she was 26 when they married about 12-13 years ago).  She definitely likes nice things, and after it was discovered that she was sleeping with her boss, she spent several years not working, playing golf, tennis and sunning at the country club.  For that reason (combined with the fact that she is spending my potential inheritance on Lexii and vacations), I cannot bring myself to like her, out of some protective instinct I have for my dad's well-being.  I know he chose to stay with her, and I know that they might have worked their marital problems out and it's none of my business, but I still dwell on it.  Hopefully he doesn't.  My grandmother is a different story.  I understand that it must be difficult to see a spitting image of the heathen Protestant who dragged your son away (in case that's unclear, I bear a striking resemblance to my mother).  But let's all grow up and stop hating me because of some decades-old mutual dislike harbored by my mom's family and my dad's (this dislike has progressed into severe distaste in the past couple of decades, which is fodder for another blog entry).  Several years ago, on one of my forced visits to her house, she said, "Oh, let me show you something!"  She came back with a framed 11X14 of all fifty or so relatives, including all twenty-plus grandchildren.  "It's the Vestal family portrait!  Isn't it great?"    I had not been invited to participate in this "family portrait."  It was this day, several years ago, when I made an immediate and certain decision to change my surname and never again claim I was related to this woman.  I knew it would be difficult for everyone involved (except her), but I'm still glad I did it.    My dad and I have cautiously ignored all of these things and can be quite civil most of the time.  If we disagree on something, we simply don't discuss it.  And if we have a few drinks, we can almost bond.
