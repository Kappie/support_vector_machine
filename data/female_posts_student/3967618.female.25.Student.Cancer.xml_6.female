Although no one has approached me personally, many of you have said that politics and pleasure don't mix.  In other words, I bring the stuff up when people are relaxing and want to forget the somber realities.  I can understand this, although I personally find such discussions enjoyable, and always try to make lots of room for diverse opinion.   Whatever the case may be, I am currently investigating the best means of channeling my idealism, which most likely will involve working with the Kerry campaign in this fall...
