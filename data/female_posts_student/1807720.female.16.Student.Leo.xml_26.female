Maybe they are right but I feel there is something wrong.  Especially Chemisty right now, I really can't take it.  I mean I know I am stressed out when I cry every night.  Today was a bit better than the rest though, and yeah I still cried for like the 6th day in a row but I felt that someone actually kind of  cared  for once.  I was just sitting up in the Science wing and Mrs. J comes up and asks me how my Chemisty is going.  Little things do make a  big difference  because I feel like she actually wants to help me and help me to pass Chemistry.  She offered her help during tutorial which is nice because I am really stressed and I honestly don't understand a word the Chem teacher says.  It's so confusing, it's like she could speak another language and I still would know the same thing as if she were speaking English.  And her directions for the lab we did today were so confusing - I really want to be able to do stuff and not just look lazy but well I don't even understand her directions but well I always found it kind of hard to understand directions when people just tell me so well it would of been nice if she could have written them out but I guess no one really learns that way except me.  I still keep wondering why I just can't get the hang of things..Chem, Math etc.  I wish there was just an answer.  I feel like I have been so rude lately too or like when someone asks me something I don't even think before I speak I just... SPEAK .  And well I sit in like this little corner on the left side of the Chem class where there is like no one to ask when I don't get anything, and well it's hard to feel like part of the class because I feel so far away - I call it the little island and I have to be careful not to lean to far back or else I'll hit my head on the pencil sharpener..lol I actually did that cause well I have to admit I am such a major clutz!  I just wish things would start going a little better and well I wish I could stop crying at night cause I am at the point where I toss and turn for even and like hardly get any sleep.  It will be nice to talk to Mrs. J tommorow it's like she is the only person who understands what I feel and what I am going through with Chem, and I pray to God that she can help me so I can do good on my quiz.
