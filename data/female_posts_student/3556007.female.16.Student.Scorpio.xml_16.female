It was just him and me, and I remember sititn gin the theater just playing footsie. Then my parents had to come and pick me up, but somehow I had my old Harry Potter cellphone wiht me. I think that we were at the church or something because I had to talk through a building that looked something like the Sunday school building but actually it was a cell phone store or something. This guy tried to fix my cellphone, but I said not to worry about it. Then I looked outside and saw Brian getting into my paren'ts car so I wnt out there and joined him. I don't know what happened next, but I found my real cellphone in my purse (the camera bag one), and text-message Brian. I had a few really weird messages come back from people. Jessie's cousin Ross sent me a text message that just showed an opened up and burning cigarette lighter on the screen then asked for a confirmation that I had seen the message. There was one other like that, but I don't remember who it was from. But, there weren't any text messages from Brian. Then I don't really remember what happened in between, but I think that in a previous dream somehow my really expensive camera got stolen. We got the location of where it was, and we were driving. It was really weird because my legs were hanging through the bottom of the car. The person that was driving was someone that I knew, but it was like mika or someone (a person younger than me that I don't really know that well... maybe I knew them from onine or something). As we were driving I saw a few different poilice cars along tghe way, and I realized what we were doing was illegal. It was late at night when we were driving, and this girl had two people in her car that weren't family. The polica cars never stopped us, thankfully. Well, we started following thei one go-cart, and I don't nkow if we were following it because we were following it or if it just happened to be going in that same direction, but we ended up following it for about half a mile. We turned off the main road onto someone's property and drove by this really shitty house. Then we drove through this door-ish square oepening in a huge, really tall chain-link fence. Then, just a littlebit ahead of us, we saw an open garage with a car and a bunch of teenagers all sitting around. I got out of the car (though I don't remember getting out of the car or how I did), and went over to them. There was a girl sitting on the floor with a backpack, and a bunch of guys sitting around a table or a car or someting they were sitting around... I am pretty sure it was a table with some stuff sitting on top of it. Well I went up tot he backpack and I was yelling at them about my camera, but the girl didn't object when I started to opent eh backpack. The weird thing was that this backpack was the same type of backpack tha tmine was, bnad it was the same colors. I started going through it, talking about my camera, and the other people who were there were like "Why do you care aabout $6?" They obviously didn't knonw which one I was talking about. "Six dollars? More like $300!" Wile I was digging through the bag, I was like "Ya know, these are teh kind of cases that make me want to be a detective." And I pulled out my camera, and the lens caps. "Where are the lenses?" I asked. And a guy who was sitting at the other table tossed them to me, but they were uncovered. And I sort of yelled at him, too, saying that they'd have to pay for them if they were scratched. I don't know how long we were there for before I actually got my camera (it was probably top about 3 minutes), but there was one guy there who was looking me up and down saying how if I'd screw him, he'd give me the camera. Well anyway, all of a sudden someoone shouted "Run!" and I thought it was the cops, so I just ran. I was wearing pink flip-flops, so it was difficult to run through the muddy grass, and the high grass. I tried to run without my shoes, but it hurt my feet. When I was running, I heard a car door slam, and my dad began calling "Kirsten! Rachel!" As I got over this one set of bush things, there was a lake of sorts... Some people were running to the right of it, some were running to the left. I was too far behind because of my flip-flops, and I just lept into the lake and submerged myself. The water wasn't cool, in fact, it was pretty warm. But I had my camera bag with me (this one jean purse that I take all over the place), and it had my cellphone in there and I think my camera. I tried to submerge that, too, but I was really worried about it ruining everything in there. I was also worried that my hair and the bag were floating up towards to top. My dad came all the way up to the lake, and I could see his feet. I don't know if he saw my hair or not... He was saying things like "Why have you left us, Kirsten, for these other people?" And I kind of saw images of the guys who were in the garage flash mefore my eyes. That is all that I remember...
