I went down there with $120, and came back with $ 0.35.. hahaha..      Yeah, the plane ride down wasn't bad, because the plane wasn'ttiny like they made it sound..it was LARGE. I mean..HUGELY large. We had a layover in Detroit, Michigan (their airport is the COOLEST of the cool), and needless to say, the plane after that was the smaller of the two. The first day, we went shopping (shocker...?) and then tried to go on this ghost tour thing, but the tourguide never showed up (yeah, what the hell, right?).       The next day, we went to Fort Jackson and saw Chad. That Army Base is HUGE!! Holy Cow..we got lost so many times. It was awesome seeing all of those army guys walking around in their cool outfits, though. ^_~    I was correct, his face thinned out a LOT. He didn't LOSE weight, so much as he gained muscle. He IS smaller, don't get me wrong, but he's not "skinny". What's left, though, is all muscle. Holy Cow, eh?   Okay, I'm backing it up. When we first got to the base (our hotel was about half a mile away, it was really close and not bad or hard to find at all), we had to go to this briefing thing where they basically made us cry by telling us how wonderful our family members were and showing us movieclips of them but not actually letting us SEE them. Then we walked outside, and,low and behold, therewere TONS of soldiers out there. Maybe around 800? Anyways, I'm scanning the crowd for my big brother, and then I hear, "KARI!!" and I turn, and there's Chad, with my dad, grandpa, mom, sister, and grandma crowded around him. I ran up to him and was just SHOCKED. No more slouching. Everything he said came out completely clear-no muttering, no stumbling over words, no stuttering, he barely even paused to think. His patience has grown TONS and TONNNNNS, and he looked amazing in his army thingy. He's also a lot more generous-he flat out told me to go into his bedroom and use whatever I found in there to my convinience. Before, if he even caught the scent of my shampoo in there, he'd throw a fit. But anyways, have you ever seen those old movies, where they see their loved one in an airport, and drop all luggage and forget about everyone around them except for that ONE person, because they missed them sooo much that they're all that matters? That's kinda how I would believe that I felt. My knees were SO weak, and I was about to burst out crying because I was so happy to see him. Of course, it was different because those are all about "I love you, let's get married and create some offspring on our honeymoon" kinda things, but that's kind of the only way I can explain it. We could take him places, but only on base. We took him to Burger King. The whole thing was odd, because they have all of this fun stuff on base (including a waterpark) but the soldiers barely even know about it. Chad only knew there was a Burger King because he saw it when they went out for jogs every day. There was a hour and a half wait in line before we got the food, and it took Chad about 5 minutes to eat it all. He goes, "Wow, you're slow." and I go, "No, you're just incredibly fast.." After few seconds, he goes, "Yeah, I guess so..I only have 10 minutes to eat my food everyday."    We went to all of these army stores that you can only be in if you have a soldier with you (well, it's SUPPOSED to be that way, even though we went in there later without him and didn't face any problems..) I bought 2 T-Shirts, a hat, a bumper sticker, blah blah blah, the list goes on forever. Hey, I'm never gonna be there again, and it was MY money..why not splurge a little? ^_~..      Whatever, even though he acted all proper, I knew that my brother was in there somewhere.      ..Mostly because when nobody was listening, he'd still joke around with me.   Good 'Ol Chad.      Thethird day was his graduation.It was odd..they all lined up on one end ofa huge field, marched over to the center, repeated a bunch of stuff, marched over tothis OTHER field, said a bunch of stuff, and it was all over. It couldn't have lasted more than30 minutes. It took us forever to find him, though. I stood over by the buses (if the soldiers couldn't find their family, they were instructed to get on the bus and ride over to the place where we first met them, sothey could meetup).so if he couldn't find us and headed over there, I would see him before he got on one. That day, we were allowed to take him off-campus, so we brought him out to eat (of course) and to a museum. To tell you the truth, I don't remember exactly where else we took him, but whatever. He had to be back earlier than the other soldiers that night (he had to be back at 7:30, they had to be back at 9:00) because he had fireguard duty (which really wasn't fair to any of us, but there's no use in complaining). So of course we brought him back early and everything, but this time he had a C.D. player, 3 C.D.'s, a bunch of cards, soap, and batteries. It was sort of a present to him, because after Bootcamp, they were allowed to have the stuff. The soap, however, was something he asked for, because they had some girly stuff that he didn't like.    When we said goodbye, my mom cried, my sister ALMOST cried, and my dad and grandpa were close to tears. This is something Chad's always wanted, and yeah, I miss him like hell, but I don't want to make him feel bad by crying in front of him, so I did the best I could to keep it in. What really got me was when my grandma started crying. It was hard to keep it in, then, because when you see your grandma cry..well, it's a horrible thing to see. Trust me.       The fourth day we toured mansions, which was kinda cool, but not as great as you would've expected. We also went and saw the rest of the museum that we missed the day before, and drove to the airport to make sure that we knew where it was. We were gonna go on the ghost tour, but it wasn't until 9:00 that night, and my mom's a wimp. ^_~      Fifth day, got up, went to the airport, RUSHED to get to the next flight on time (we got there as it was boarding), got to the Milwaukee Airport, my aunt drove us home. End of story. This thing is too long, anyways. I bet right now, if you're reading this sentence, you haven't read the whole thing.      ..You jerk. ^_~      By the way, I AM happy to be home, and I DID miss you all. Don't be too depressed. ^_~
