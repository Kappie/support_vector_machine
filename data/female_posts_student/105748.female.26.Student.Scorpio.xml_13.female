Just be patient and keep blogging anyway.    Hey, did you guys hear about Mayon Volcano? It's been errupting sporadically for the past two months and after a two week lull, I heard it errupted again !  I'm so glad that my family is far from that area. If you guys still have family in the Philippines who happen to live close to the volcano, I hope they are well. You might try to get in touch with them just to make sure everything is okay.
