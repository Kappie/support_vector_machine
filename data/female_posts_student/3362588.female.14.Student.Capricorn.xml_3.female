Do you think your pretty 'cause I do.   AWWW!!  I hate that!  When your mom's friends are all talking and one of them turns to you and says something like that.  Or when your mom and your friend's moms start talking about rather *ahem* private stuff about all of you infront of their male children and your standing right there (I'm sure Elena can remember at least one of these instinces.  heh).  Hate that.    Yeah......................... So..........................................  Better be signing of.................   Ooooo.... pops concert tonight... well ttyl Jack the Greatest
