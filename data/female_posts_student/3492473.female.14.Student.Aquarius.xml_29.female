I'm just totally confused now because I think I still like him but I mean, he broke up w/ me w/out even trying to talk it out! He believed a girl that hates me! I feel like I sorta lost his trust or something. I dunno, this is all very complex. I had something great and now I don't.  Do I want it back?  I dunno...  I just can't believe how fast it ended.  We were together for like 5 months! (from the two times we went out) That's almost half a year! Is that too long for two 14 year olds relationship? I dunno... In high school, I'm gonna be soo busy. I mean soccer, school work, class president duties, trying to have a life, probly student council, I mean do I really wanna throw a boyfriend in there? I mean, sure, it'd be nice but it'd be hard to juggle everything... I guess whatever happens, happens... but for right now I think  I'm gonna try to be single ... Sorry Chris, hope we can still be friends...
