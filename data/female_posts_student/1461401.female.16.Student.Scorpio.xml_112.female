The reason you suffer is because when I am gone, there is still hope of my return. So you're forced to wait. The wait for my return is what drives you so crazy, which is why I tell you before I leave this one last time I'm not coming back. It's better this way. Easier on both of us. I'm sorry for troubling you for so long.   Goodbye.
