I am gonna have a very hard time dealing with them.  Anyway I still haven´t done my reading for tomorrow, wait....this si souding like the school year.  haha.  Orientation is tonight and school is tomorrow.  Apparently I forgot an alarm, so I had to go out and buy one.  But the little old man gave me a free battery, and even asked if I wanted him to wrap it,if it was a present, I told him no. I am going in search of laundry detergent, there are no laundry facilities anywhere.  You can have the hotel do it and the charge roughly 4€ per piece, it varies as to what exactly they are washing, these idiots are gonna ravage my clothes.  Sucks.  Glad I left my fav saggy Dolce cargos.  Or I can send the laundry out and they charge by weight, still it feels weird to have others touch my stuff.  thats icky.  Lots of love, pics will be posted on here soon.  TTYL
