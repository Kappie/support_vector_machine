But theres this HUGE bitch behind me n shes y blondes get the bad rep.. so yeh. But this is like the 1st night n 2 that I havent been over at Justins.. Last night and the night before.. haha! I love that kid from here to the moon. hes AMAZIN! so yes. Idk wat else to really say.. Tomorrows gonna pretty much be the same ol routine.. wake up at 7 go to summer camp till 1:30 then go out w/ my baby n then go to drivers ed at 6 n then get home at like 9:30.. yeah my mom n Wayne are NEVER on time to pickin me up so Im always like the last one.. but at least now I have a cell so I can call ppl n chat so I dont look like a total dork.. lol. but yah.
