I liked it there a lot. The only bad part was the crappy dorm rooms. I'm seriously considering going there. It's far enough away that I can get away from all this bull shit but close enough that I can still hang out with the few good friends I still have on a weekend or something. I don't know yet though. Then I didn't go to field hockey because I was so tired. So instead I went to Barnes and Noble book store and bought some books to read. I'm actually going to read over the summer, that's how bored I've been lately. I need some better people to hang out with. Not just anyone, people that actually understand me and know who I really am and like that same things as me. All of my friends from school seem to care less right now. I don't understand. The end of school was so great, it was the best time I've had in a long time and now I don't talk to any of them. It seems as if the only person I talk to online regularly is Gavin. He seems as if he's the only one that will actually talk to me and listen to my shit (or atleast pretend to care about what I'm talking about). I don't know. All my other friends don't care what I'm going through, it's just all about them and if they are having fun. I just don't get it, is there something I'm missing here?  Saturday- I did nothing all day. I watched the Butterfly Effect. It was a pretty good movie.  Today- I'm at my dad's and I'm bored out of my mind. My life just sucks lately and it's about to get worse.   Why do I write in this anyways? No one cares.
