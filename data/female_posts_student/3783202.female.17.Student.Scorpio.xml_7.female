We went to go watch the fireworks at Rosenblatt. So they were supposed to start at 9:30...definetly did not start until 11:30. Or around there. So we're chillin at his house and were watchin this movie. And he goes upstairs to tell Lexy(his little niece) bye and so he comes back down and sits down and leans over to try and kiss me! And I backed up and he was like What? I was like Nothing. He he like puts his hand on my face and kisses me which in turn i have no choice because I can't back up because myhead is against the  couch and his hand is on my neck so I can't turn.  But I didn't kiss him back, at first,which I felt kind of bad about, but then after I talked to Cassie the other day we both came to the conclusion that he could turn into one of those scary guys who would like rape you or something. So I ended up kissing him back and we kissed for a couple minutes and then I just kinda stopped. And the bad part about it, I didn't feel anyting. Which I don't know if that's supposed to mean something or what. But most the the time the one thought that was running through my head was me and Brent dancing at prom. Is that sad or what? So,I told him when I first got there I might fall asleep. Hummmm What did you think I did....I fell "asleep"  So I learned that I can fake sleep extremely well. Because I ended up "sleeping" for 2 hours. Which again I felt bad about. Then he "woke" me up and I moved to his bed...hmm Mistake you might ask. Um I would definetly say so. But aha you have to know how to play the game...I "slept" on my stomach...ha ha which mean't he could touch me or anything which I was very proud of, no help from Alex which God knows I wanted to call her and cry. I wanted to leave. And the entire time I was there and when I was kissing him the one person that always comes into my mind did. And I almost called him his name...sevral different times. So I finaly "wake" up because we have to leave because Dave is coming. So dave definetly did not come for like a half-n-hour. And now that I'm "awake" and laying in his bed, this could only mean one thing. Hummm lets think about this one. Well if your wondring if I did. I didn't. I'm a good girl. And when I say that I don't mean it sarcastically because I am. we just kissed for a long time. which seemed like forever and the entire time all I wanted to do was stop. And the entire time all I could think of was him. I felt horrible. I felt like I wa cheating on someone, and that everything could have ended there. I tried to call home to see if my dad could give me some sort of excuse to come home or soemthing...but no answer. they went downtown with Aunt Rhonda, Uncle jason, and Carolyn, Gage, and Jaden. Danny called and I had to stop myself from saying come and get me because I was that uncomfortable.  So let's back up a little bit. So we're kissing and he goes "You know Rachel, I think that you should go out with me." I was like Now why would I go and do something like that? He goes I dont know because you want to. I was like well who says I do. And it ended there. Does that mean that I said yes? Becuase I really hope that it doesn't. I don't think that I like him. I mean ou know that something is there when you get nervous around them and get that little feeling in your stomach.  Well when he kissed me I didn't feel anything. Nothing. Nothing at all! And I didn't get nervous or shy around him. And I acted differently. When I'm with Brent I act like myself. And even if I'm sitting next to him I get nervous. I've never kissed Brent, but when he hugs me I get that little feeling in my stomach, even if its just for a second. And I'm starting to think that I like that even better. I like being with him more than I like being with Dustin. That right there...scares me.
