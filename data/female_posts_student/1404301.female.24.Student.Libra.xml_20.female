Back in Adelaide for the start of the 2nd semester at Uni...Before telling you how excited I am to be back in class, I have to let you know that Dylan and I enjoyed our trip in   urlLink  Sydney   .    We arrived at 10am on a Wednesday, happy because it meant that we would sleep confortably compared to the train - we forgot the pillow which can be quite useful sometimes! :-) - and after setting in the perfect hotel close to the airport - we could see it from our windows but it would cost us 35$ to go there in a taxi! - we decided to walk around in the city.  From the Harbour and its ferries to China Town and its City Marketwe wereenchanted by the city. It was busy for sure but nice and enjoyable to visit.    My sister Maud arrived well the next morning from Hong Kong, she stayed with us at the Formule 1 hotel for the week until we find a nice place for her to stay. We went to   urlLink  UNSW      with her, helped her with the paperwork and the accomodation - thanks to Dylan who passed all the phone calls ;-).    Despite a couple of rainy days we decided to get out of bed and visit the town. We ended up most of the time in different shopping centres. I think that my sister will enjoy her time in Sydney and I am sure that Dylan loved our trip. We left last Wednesday and arrived in Adelaide the next Thursday. Tears didin't roll on our cheeks but it was a bit sad to say "Bye" to my sister. The good thing is that she will come in September to Adelaide and as my grand dad used to say "Good things need to end otherwise we wouldn't appreciate them so much!".    We took some photos and we will post them up soon so you can have a look at our favourite sites in Sydney and our cutty little faces!!
