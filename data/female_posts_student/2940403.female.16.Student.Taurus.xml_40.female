In her profile as an away message, for everyone to see how  miserable  her life is, she has written...  Love yourself~ Sometimes we can get so obsessed with ourselves, with our pain, with how others have slighted us, how life is screwing us over. Sometimes we need to quit wallowing and get invloved with something that lets us forget ourselves for a while.~   and then  in her profile    sad and frustrated...  Doesn't her pain make you want to cry?  Not really... but her bad grammar and spelling makes her look as if she has an IQ level of a newly born chimp, (which, even though they are related to us, isnt very high)... now that's something to make us want to cry.  :)
