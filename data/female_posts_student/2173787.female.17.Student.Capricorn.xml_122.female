There is one cage however, that I cannot accept and have found myself constantly thrown against the bars of recently.  This cage is self built; something I didn’t know existed until after the construction had been completed.  The cage I built for myself is made of independence, something stronger than any tangible metal.  Since I was a toddler I have been slowly building up my independence.  When I was three I resented the little child leash that my parents kept me on when we went shopping and decided to get rid of it.  I figured out how to work the Velcro and disconnected it from the harness I wore and connected it to a clothes rack and crawled off, much to the terror of my mother.  At age 5, I desperately wanted bunk beds so I could sleep up high, like my older neighbor.  After much pleading my parents bought me a set.  The first night I climbed up the ladder, into bed, and my parents kissed me goodnight; before they left the room, though, they removed the ladder to prevent me from falling.  It didn’t take long for me to realize that I was trapped and needed them to get me in and out of bed.  Needless to say, the next night, and every night after that, I slept on the bottom bunk.  My independent tendency continued on throughout everything I did.  It became assumed that I did not need help on my homework, and if something I was struggling with something I would come and tell people when I was ready.  The problem is that I don’t tell people when I am struggling and instead everyone realizes it after a lot of damage has been done.  I somewhere along the way decided that it was not good to be dependent on anybody for anything, and somehow never noticed that I made the decision.  Now that I have an issue before me to deal with I realize that I have no where to go.  I have become accustomed to making incredibly shallow friendships on my part and suddenly this is beginning to bother me.  No matter what is going on in my mind the standard answer to “how are you doing,” is “fine”.  Sometimes my lies are noticed, but people still assume that I will come to them if the issue grows large enough.  So now I am forced to look for support; an outlet to pour my emotions into and there is no where for them to go.  I go to approach someone and have a real discussion about how I’m feeling and turn around, not knowing how to.  The most frustrating thing in dealing with this cage is knowing that I built it I welded the padlock shut, and I alone somewhere hold the key (hopefully).
