You're probably wondering how all these words tie together (unless you're an alert and thinking Joy Raub...) . Well, e-mail me (Forever Rebel@aol.com) and if your right, I'll do something, I just don't know what it'll be yet. Um...kudos to who or what these words are about!  I also wanna give kudos and a big mazel tov to all the people closest to me such as:  In General...CCDS Class of 2004!!!  But other peeps such as: Ma homegirl, Joy! Ma other homegirl, Jules! Ma homeboys: Matt S, Robert M, and Michael! Ma other homegirls: Rach, Sahiba, Rebekkah, and Carolyn! Ma newest homeboy: Timmy Boy! Ma old-school homeboy: Danny! And to anyone else who I forgot...LOL  Don't hate cause I forgot you, cause now you can't complain to me about how much you don't like me cause we don't go to the same school anymore!!! Hahahahaha! That's only if you were going to say something bad...LOL, anyways...  Piece of advice for all boys and girls out there: Don't make-out and do nasty stuff in the bathroom with people named Eric (lol) that you've only known about 2 hours. It'll do the whole surrounding area some good! Just keep your hands (and your private parts) to yourself! They may come in handy one day when you're bored...LOL!!!  Well, do I have anything else to say for today? You bet I do! Go to poetry.com and search under the name Courtney Berry and go to the first poet you see named Courtney Berry and check out some of my poetry!  BTW, Robert, I really would love what your poem entitled 'Trebor' had to say in it!  BTW, Nick, aka soccerplaya17171, um...it seems as though you are trying really hard to build a friendly relationship with me, and that's kewl and all...it's just that, maybe you should approach it from a different angle. I mean, instead of me talking to you for one day and then you acting like you've known me for years, maybe you should ask me questions about myself. But I love you anyways!!!  Um, I think that's enough for this post...I don't wanna bore y'all...Love y'all much! Love and Madness!!
