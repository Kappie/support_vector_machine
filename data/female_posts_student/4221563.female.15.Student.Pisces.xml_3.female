It's like breakfast cereal- if you eat rice bubbles two years straight you wake up one morning and realise you can't think about rice bubbles without throwing up.    Same with me and School.       I feel like I'm ready to become my own person- ready to live my own life. I'm sick of having to listen and conform to the rules of people I don't like and never will like. I'm sick of coming home with headaches because I've spent the day with a bunch of idiots who have no respect for themselves or anyone else. I'm sick of people looking at me weird, sick of doubting myself, sick of everything.    Just sick.       I'm sure Lauren is avoiding me and I'm sorry about that. Sometimes, I feel like she's being degradory to me and that's why I moved in maths- but I never wanted lunch to turn into a slinging fest. That was wrong and I truly regret it. We all do.       Friday afternoons aren't meant to be like this. I'll be home alone (besides from Dylan, who doesn't count) for the entire night, save a few hours after five. I wonder if Majah will let me rent movies. I need something to stop me thinking.    My English teacher thinks I'm a freak, I've decided.       I've got to write an essay. 'Prejudice obscures the truth'. I would love to be dangerously edgy and say that Prejudice maketh the truth- but I'm not sure I believe that and therefore would only be doing it to shitstir.    Shucks for me.       *   Will Bloom: A man tells so many stories, that he becomes the stories. They live on after him, and in that way he becomes immortal.    - From Big Fish.
