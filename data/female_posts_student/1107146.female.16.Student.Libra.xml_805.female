We were walking out to my car and suddenly he's like "It's too bad you're going out of town for Valentine's Day.  I had something planned."  So I asked what he had planned and he said he couldn't tell me because he was going to do it next Valentine's Day.  Thought that was interesting.  Not that I mind him looking to the future or whatever, that's good, just... I don't know.  Struck me as odd.
