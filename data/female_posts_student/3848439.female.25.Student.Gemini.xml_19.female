Jeremiah 16:19  Jairus came and, when he saw Jesus, fell at his feet and begged him repeatedly, "My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well, and live." So he went with him. Mark 5:22-24  Dear God, we come today to thank you and praise you for the gift of our lives - for joys and sorrows, for health and suffering, for belief and doubt. We are thankful that we can come to you with our prayers, knowing that you hear us and respond to us. Amen.
