I'm a freak b). I'm a stalker/groupie c). I have a foot fetish  or d). All of the above rolled into one freaky package of strangeness.   If you answered d, CONGRATULATIONS! you were correct! Please click  urlLink here  to claim your prize.  We've all been starstruck at one stage of our lives. We've all had posters of   urlLink The Vines / urlLink Jet / urlLink Avril Lavigne ,  (one and the same to me)   urlLink Molly Meldrum  or  urlLink Kerry-Anne Kennerly    (in my mind slightly more talented than those above)  and dreamed of a life less ordinary.  A life on the other side of the barrier. But what makes a 'star' a 'star'? Why do we care what Johnny Depp ate for lunch? Why do we want to know that Nicole Kidman's dog cheated on it's wife? Obviously there is a huge market for this, and the success of magazines life NW and Who Weekly (along with the fact that I have a link to Billy Corgan(Smashing Pumpkins)'s blog on this very page..sshhhh!) is testament to this. Whether it's a vicarious longing to be someone else, or simply an interest in that particular person's art, varies greatly from person to person. But when 'stars' become more than human, a real problem arises, and double standards emerge as second nature.  Michael Jackson can afford the best lawyers and therefore can avoid jail (at least for now),  Footballers can get away with murder (literally) and not get chastised,  and our favourite stars can cheat on their wives (hello Becks) and remain in our shrines.  Fame certainly is a strange thing, just ask the girl next to me at Eskimo Joe whose shirt was signed NO LESS than 8 times by each member of the band  on seperate occasions , and left 10 minutes before it ended so she could 'secure a place near the exit'.  And don't you think...   Gotta go! I think I just saw Winona Ryder's cousin's best friend's mum!
