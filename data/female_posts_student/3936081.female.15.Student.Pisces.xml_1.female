I understand a lot more now and he was not doubting that it is mutual but he was having trouble accepting the fact... any way yeah today is very boring and my sister is being an annoying brat... well any way yeah I got her to stop because she is a spoiled Brat and I just gave her what she wanted... thats the way to handle it right? any way yeah this is taking me a while to write because I am trying not to look at the key board but I give up... LOVE YA ALL and by the way if you want to know what the Crockett thing is it was a dare from Matt he dared me to put a random last name up so I did
