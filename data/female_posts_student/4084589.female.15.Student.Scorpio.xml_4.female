No, not by myself. This time I actually went to a proper salon and proper salon people cut it. I think it looks great. My mum hates it so I figure it is great.Have absolutely no plans for tomorrow. Might head out to swim tomorrow. Yes, people I swim. Had some fantastic pictures taken by sham that day. Thought might add to to my Friendster but felt that would be too obnoxious.  Annoying Boy keeps calling and texting me. Dont know whether "correcting my bitchyness" was a good plan afterall.Till tommorow.
