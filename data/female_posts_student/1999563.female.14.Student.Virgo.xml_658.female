Tonight we went to my Aunt Sharons house. I visited my cousins pet rats. Haha! They were cuteeee! They like sniffed my fingers and stuff! Haha!  Well, that audio for blogger thing absolutely rocks. I would totally check it out: www.audioblogger.com  The only problem is you have to call this number to record a message and the number is long distance. I have to use my mom or dads cellphone to get it to work.  Yup yup.  I am not feeling very talkative...adios!
