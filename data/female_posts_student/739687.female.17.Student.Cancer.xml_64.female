But my classes aren't so bad, and I think I'll survive. So yea...I just hope I don't spend another horrid year in Concert 1. Anyways...not much to say about that mess...  Why are people never who they seem? It's pretty depressing...and people really are good at letting me down. Maybe because I build them up too much. Maybe it's all in my head. Maybe I stress too much over nothing. Anyone have a solution? I'm open to just about anything. Life is so stressful.
