I was speechless, to be honest I still am....I need closure!!!  Stupid Woman ...ah I feel much better now....(and to add insult to injury it ain't even Mariah's song).   On that note I had the misfortune of watching Queen Latifah's "Bringing Down The House".  Again I'm lost for words!!!!  In the movie the only plausible explanation for a black woman living in a white man's home was because she was the nanny/maid... the words "Aunt Jemima" and "Yes Massa" were even incorporated into the script ...come on now!!!  The movie sent out a really negative message about race relations, which is a shame.  Maybe I'm naive but I thought the appropriate parties had already received that message, you know that one where we don't judge people based on stereotypes....(I'm so glad I didn't pay to see it).
