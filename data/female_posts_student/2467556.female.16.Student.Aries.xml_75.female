This means that Dallas has to work twice as hard tonight, not that i would expect any less :)  We play Edmonton tonight at 9 freaking o clock....but i have no hw tonight so it doesn't matter how late i stay up.  Lindsay Kazi tried to convince me today that i really am pretty and all that.....meh, if i was that pretty, i would have a boyfriend.  The end.    gooooooo dallas!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
