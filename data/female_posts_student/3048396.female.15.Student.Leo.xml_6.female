Some ppl just wont shut up in class which makes the rest of the class do extra work...and half of the talkers dont do all their work anyways. It really makes me mad. Since I do all my work everynight. *Sigh* Yeah....kinda makes a person mad...  Well lately Ive been doing alot of cleaning in my room and this room the computer room. This summer we're gonna redo my room in orange, green, and yellow. It shall be really neat. Plus those are my favorite colors as of now. Then in here we'll probably get a TV and either a couch or a futon or something so then I can just have a hang out place back here...Hopefully a door to this room too...lol..I could just live down here then...a few feet from the fridge...tv computer...itd all be great. lol So yeah thats whats gonna be keeping me busy until summer.   So yeah. School is fine. Gay like normal...only 27 days of school left. That sounds better than June 4th. Oh well it'll go fast..Plus im kinda likin the fact that when Im there I dont eat which makes me skinnier...cuz when im home...parents will make me eat and thats just no fun. So yeah....well i'll stop rambling now...and let you go back to ur life.....  -Tara
