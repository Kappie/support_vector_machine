Waiting for you here I'd be your anything."  when I was younger, I didn't think about it  now I can't get it out of my mind  I'm on bended knees    was I a fool to think  the way you looked at me  I swear you did  but you looked away too quick  was I a fool to think  that you would take me home, as if I was yours  was I a fool to think at all   "And yet my day is not so full  There might be nothing left to do "  "I had it all and I risked it"  what you are is a best in a lover's arms  what you are is the devil in a sweet sweet kiss  what you are is a puzzle to me   "I'm shattered, But it really doesn't matter, 'Cause my rescue is going to be here soon"
