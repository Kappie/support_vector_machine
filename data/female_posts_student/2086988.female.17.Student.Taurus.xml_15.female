She won, she got 4 in her mouth, I only got 3 :(, I don't whether having a small mouth is good or bad...I knew Kiera could put alot more in her mouth, :::cough, cough::: no comment...Anyways, I can't wait for Christmas!! I'm about 95% sure all plans are go :::wink, wink::: Seeing David, aww that'll be the best thing ever, I'm all excited, yet nervous. He is so sweet, ahhhh I don't know how I got so lucky with a guy like him. He's everything I want in a guy, cute, smart, funny, caring, romantic, gosh everything! I never been with anyone like him before, this is the greatest thing ever! He really helped me the other night, and he even knew I didn't want to talk, which made it even cuter, because it showed how much he cares! I was like awwwww...how did I get such a great guy? I LOVE DAVID!!! :-D!!!!!!!   I don't know how you do what you do I'm so in love with you
