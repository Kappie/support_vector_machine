Today i am babysitting, its not so bad one is sleeping right now so s'all good, and the other is watching lilo and stitch, so he's quiet too. they're not that bad, but sometimes they scream when they don't get there way, but other then that they're good kids.   I have been finding out a few interesting things this week. Like the only person in this world you can is you, and that you always need to watch what u say around your supposed friends, because some of them miht just turn around and stab you in the back, and trust me im learning that the hard way. you see i have this male friend for reasons i won't explain now, lets change his name, well call him todd. Now i thought todd was my friend, you know a good guy who was fun to hang around with and are pretty cool, but i was off on that one...on his website he wrote that i was a mental case and that i worshiped him, and that i needed happy pills to make myself feel better. So i had a few stressful days, does that make me a mental case?? i don't think so. And as for having to stay home from school to take care of my brother and sister...he totally switched my words around..i said that while i was home sick, if my sibling came home sick at least i'd be there to take care of them while my mom was at work. He irks me so much. how in the hell can he think of himself so highly?? He shits and farts like the rest of us? so why does he think he's all high and mighty? he has flaws, he has issues like the rest of us. So why doesn't he come off his high horse and spend a day in reality for a while??  Anywayz...my mom had surgery schedualed on the 18th, but she had to cancel it, because she schedualed to work the next day, so she has no healing time...but she still has to pay the bill which is shitty...thats $300 that could go to something more important, like food and supplies for the house...not a surgery she isn't getting. I think it plain out sux..she shouldn't have to pay for it if she's not getting it done.  But hey Im 17 in 7 days...one whole week and i start a new year...yeah..Im going to be having a party on the 27th, the day after i take my driving test, cuz i can't have it the same day, cuz if i fail i'll be too embarrassed to see anyone. Im just gonna rent movies, order pizza and chill with a few close friends. Im not having a big blow out. Theres not much point until im old enough to legally drink, cuz then it'll be huge and awsome. But i'll probably watch fear  loathing in las vegas with the gang then another one with the sleep over buds, but im not sure which one yet!! im so indecisive when it comes to that sorta thing, i wanna see every movie, so it doesn't work that way. But thats just me, i like good movies...and i know there's some i've never seen that are probably really good. My friend emily tries to open my eyes to new movie swhen she can, and tries to be the best friend ever, which she is, and im sorry to those of whom i've been a bitch to..with the stress and the PMS i gues my attitude got a little out of hand, and i don't mean to spaz on people, but i feel strongly about so many things that my opinion takes over and i defend my beliefs...im sorry if you don't like that but its who i am, and i won't change for anyone, so if you don't accept me the way i am, then get out of my life, because i don't need or want friends like you.  I am in a very good mood today, but i had to express myself, because of my open minded opinion....lol...irony eh?? anywayz i must be going...i need to relax for a bit cuz im kinda tired...im trying to put together a dance for a talent show comming up...me and my over extending myself...*big smiles*...i'll be sure to write in here again when i have the time...and i will try to write in here everyday if i can...Well i'll talk to you all later   Your Sincerly  Lil' Nicki
