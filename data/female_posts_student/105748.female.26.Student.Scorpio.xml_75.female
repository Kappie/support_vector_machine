BTW, Ching, thank you for the invitation. I'm new to this so I hope it works out.  I revisited the spark.com website. I remember taking the purity test a months ago, but I cannot remember my score. I scored 52% slutty on the slut test (with the worldwide average being 46%). For the Gay Test I'm 56% gay (the typical lesbian is 39%). And according to spark's Gender Test, statistically my gender is male. Spark is inaccurate. And I think the people who run that site dislike Canadians.  Names? Web Cloggers, Net Hoggers, Ching's Loggers
