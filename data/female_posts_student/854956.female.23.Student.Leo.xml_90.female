Throw rocks at the jerks, commend the non-jerks 3)  Rogue or Jean Grey?  Rogue 4)  Matrix Reloaded or X2? X2 5)  Mr. Sinus or Open Screen Night?  Mr. Sinus... though I'll never forget Ricky's debut as an exhibitionist!  ;) 6)  Thought provoking question:  What would YOU do for a Klondike bar?  I think the farthest I'd go is flashing my boobs for a Klondike bar, but unless I was in the middle of a bout with hypoglycemia, I don't know if I'd go much further than saying "please?"
