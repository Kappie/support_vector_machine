I found some one who seriously needs to get out... more than me! I'm not sad any morreeeeeeeeee (I don't think that changes the fact that your sad) eeeeeee! Yeay! Shut up you! Ohhh! Geez I wish I had some money! I've found the cutest phone cover ever! It's by Sanrio and it's panda's falling over! AWW! Ok, so my version of cute is a bit different from other people's version of cute. Hey, if we all had the same version of cute then how would I survive! I need individuality!
