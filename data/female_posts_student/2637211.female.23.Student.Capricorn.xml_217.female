I've been working a little bit to casually and I took an awfully long break for a barbecue over at Dave and Alexa's. That was a good time, thought I started to feel overwhelmed and worry about my paper when everyone started talking about going for a hike. Maybe I'm just lame and lazy, but I just felt like I had to finish this paper, and going for a hike would eat into my working time too much. Taking a few hours for a meal seems okay, but I feel like I need to devote more of my energy to this paper. Of course, work is slow going, but I'm getting going.
