(granted, it was andy roddick and who WOULDNT sit and watch him all day?? but still lol)...i have to work tonight 5-12pm..not too much fun, but i need the money so i'll just suck it up and go lol...i talked to rossin the other day and i miss her so much! i dont realize how much i do until i talk to her..and i love all the stories from idaho she tells me! the other day she 'practically went on a date with mculley culkin'!! (yeah, dont know how to spell his name!)...my mom and i went to the beach yesterday and i got buuurned...so now im in pain, not fun, wear your sunscreen kids...it was good 'mother daughter' time though, so...well, i dont really have to much more to say, things are pretty slow today...i doubt many people will read this anyways but hey its something for me to do! lol have a faabulous day! :-D
