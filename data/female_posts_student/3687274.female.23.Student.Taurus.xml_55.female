Hazarr!  not like i'm in any hurry to turn 23, I just like birthdays :)  Thanks for the blog about my age thals, it only took me an hour to stop crying, no harm done. *wipes away a tear*  my van has been making this rattleing sound for a couple days now.  kinda like its scraping metal against the pavement, but nothings hanging off.  But good news, it stopped making the sound today.  Can anyone guess why?  Thats right, because whatever was making the sound fell off at the corner of west blvd and haven ave.  My sister took the van to work and called me to let me know this interesting fact. So i went out to go look for the parts and all i found was an old muffler in some guys yard.  might be ours, might not.  guess if the van is making noise that could wake the dead it might be ours.  *shrugs* I'm getting my hair streaked today.  My sis (robin) gave me an early b-day present and said I could get whatever I wanted done to my hair.(origoto nechan! - sound it out, I don't know how to write in Japanese)  My first choice was blonde wih blue streaks, but then I probably would have gotten fired and i like money so I'm settleing for golden blonde with light blonde and read streaks.  I'm not too olo for that style, am I?  If you say yes, so help me god I will find you in your home cut off your legs, set your house on fire and watch as you drag your stumpy ass through the bazing inforno!  but be honest :)  We'll see what happens, its only hair, it'll grow back....but your legs won't!    Sorry, sometimes I get a little angry.  'k, well, I have nothing more to say and I'm hunry, so bye.
