I want a boy and a girl. So that way I have both. Lol  Girl Name-Paris, Chevelle, Alexandria Boy Name-Devin, Devon, Devontae  Tregory came up with Paris. :) Don't think it's like Paris Hilton or anything. I like the name Chevelle even if it is a car. People name their child's Alexis or Mercedes. So why can't I? I've always loved the name Alexandria.  I like Devin and Devon, I think I heard if off of That's So Raven. Not sure. I like Devontae because this cute little boy in my Karate class was named that. And he was just so cute even though he was much younger and shorter than me. He was just SO cute. So were his little brothers...Awww  Anyways I just got off the phone with Tregory.   Laters...Cherry...Happy...Girl...
