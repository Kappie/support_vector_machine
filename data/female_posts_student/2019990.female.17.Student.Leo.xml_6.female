She looked pretty nervous though, and a little confused.  I also worked on editing our next episode, and we're doing a segment on how everyone complains about our episodes, but they never have any suggestions for us.  I would have to say Lola is a very talented actress, she plays a very good valley girl.  Props to you Lola.  Well I'm off, I have Envirothon.  We're preparing our skit.  It's going to be good.  *And Scene!*
