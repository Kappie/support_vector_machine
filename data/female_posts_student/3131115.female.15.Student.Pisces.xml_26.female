All these people think that I do this shit all the fucking time, but I dont. I dont even do it anymore..It's bull shit..Grr..anyhow. I saw ashley today and I wanted a hug...that didnt happen. heh..but Bill and I were really good today.hehe We went to the art show and it was nice being about to walk alone holding hands in school. Anyhow other than that..I'm still waiting for my Cierra to call. I hope that she calls REALLY soon! I NEED to talk to her:( Grr....Grrr....Grrrr...I dont have anything else to say. I'll write more later.
