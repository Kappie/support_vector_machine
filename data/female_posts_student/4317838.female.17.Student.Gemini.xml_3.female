Fair enough, in a text message you need to conserve the space you have, and so shorter words are used in order to get what you want to say across. In MSN Messenger and e-mails it's just plain annoying. It really doesn't take long to type things out properly, even for someone who's not an experienced typist, so why don't you do it?? Not only is it annoying to people like me, but it makes you come across as thick in my opinion. The people I know that do it are generally put under the label of 'scally' but some of the people really aren't like that at all, the way they type just makes them seem that way... So please, if you fall into the category of shameless txt speaker, try and do something about it, not just for my sake, but for your own.
