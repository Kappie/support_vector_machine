In other news this last weekend I have been packing up the apartment and have unofficially, but officially have moved back to my mom's. I will try to add new entries but I am not to sure how long my computer will be down. Don't worry though, I have plenty of opportunities to use computers so I will not be gone for too long, but rest asure I will try to keep this blog updated.
