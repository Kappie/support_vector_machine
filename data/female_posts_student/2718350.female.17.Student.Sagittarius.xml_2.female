Finals are finally over and guess what!? i survived! thats right i might not have passed but at least im still here.  to releive the stress that finals gave to us jess, erin and I went shopping! *Chloe i kno we said we were gonna go to hollister and not south coast but our plan changed! im sorry sweetie i should have called you!* but shopping was fun Abercrombie having big sale right now! erin bought a 4 doller abercrombie shirt even the boys have to give her some props for that one. i cant say the same for myself because well i didnt save so much but i have really comfy pants and a new shirt to show for my none saving-ness-ness or something... but yes this weekend should rock not only because it is a 4 day weekend baby but because the the sub club of The Club is meeting. Thats right its a singles club meeting... WoOt wOoT! but anyhow it still makes me laugh to think that some people whom i wont name think that Mr. Happy is a dildo! thats right folks but in all seriousness Mr. Happy is not a Dildo. but yea i think imana go do something semi productive...or just watch me some good ol' quality tele-vision.-muahs!
