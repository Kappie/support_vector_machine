I vote you say something to Rob.  It's been a total of like two weeks of us being in school whilst dating and/or going out and/or whatever, and I don't think I've gotten even like a hug since then.  And everyone KNOWS I'm too much of a wimp to ever say anything.  *sigh* This is getting amazingly frustrating.  Roll some heads, Josh.  He considers you a good friend, so freaking talk to him.  Note: NOT while I'm in the room.  Talk to him when you see him in the mornings or something.  And don't tell him I told you to tell him.  You know the standard procedure.  God, I HATE GUYS!!!  (Not you, Josh.  You either, Will.  But that's probably cause I'm not planning on dating either of you in the next twenty years or so.)  But the rest of them are impossible to figure out.  He treated me more like a girlfriend BEFORE we went out.  He hasn't even bothered to set up a freaking DATE yet.  Such a puss, my God.  Josh, you thought you were bad... that was nothing.  Just talk to him please.  This is getting amazing frustrating if you couldn't tell by my little rant.  It's amazing how frustrated I can get at him and it still be impossible to get mad at him.  Even a little bit.  I think it's the dimple.
