Zum Sterben und zum meiner Rum'...( i cant remember all of it...)  Aeroplane song:  One of these nights about twelve o'clock, the old world's gonna reel and rock.  The sinner's gonna tremble and cry for pain and the Lord will come in his aeroplane.  O ye thirsty of ev'ry tribe!  Get your ticket for an aeroplane ride!  Jesus, our savior is a comin to reign and the Lord will come in his aeroplane!  I know you guys dont want to hear my dumb stories about my life but i have no other things to write.  Besides, they might be WAY too deep for anyone to understand ^_-
