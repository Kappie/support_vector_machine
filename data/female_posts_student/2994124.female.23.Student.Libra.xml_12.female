Just wanted to apologise for my splurge last night. It scares me how quickly my feelings can change and how fast my thoughts gain power and control. Still feeling pretty crappy about those things, but am trying to gain some perspective on it all.  Also managed to wake up at 8am which made me proud of myself (am really struggling to get up at the moment as I'm not getting to sleep until late).    Nothing much of interest has happened today - just lectures and had impromptu meeting with Debs (cheers matey).  But then actually I went and played the piano for about an hour in the chaplaincy which was WONDERFUL. Just the therapy I needed.  I have discovered this lovely song 'Oh kneel me down again' and the chorus is cool - very real and not everything-is-perfect-when-you-know-God:  "You are the God of the broken, the friend of the weak; you wash the feet of the weary, embrace the ones in need. I want to be like you Jesus to have this heart in me. You are the God of the humble, you are the humble king"  And I played it over and over again! Made me feel far better.  Anyway am off to a MedSIN meeting now. More later...
