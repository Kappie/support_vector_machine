I mean, I have an extremely sporadic person so sticking with one skin for awhile tends to bore me. I like this skin though- despite the grandma(ish) feel to the background.  Wanna know why?? No? Well your going to hear why I like it anyway.    1. It was easy! This skin was so easy to customize it wasn't funny. 2. The neatness! Everything has it's own place and it's easy to see. 3. Blockquotes! Now I can put my poems, stories, dialogue, and lists in a completely different box!   Special, I know.  Now maybe some of you will leave comments! Maybe I should rephrase that. Now ya'll better leave comments! My life isn't that boring that you can't leave me a tip or two from a day to day basis. And no, I do not pay the person who comments the most :-P.   In other news...  I'm crushing on someone. No, I'm not "crushing" someone. Note the "on". Yea, his name shall remain anonymous for several different reasons which I will not disclose at this time. All you need to know is that I have a thing for him and it's not an internet guy(lol). Although... tim's one friend is really hott.... *shakes out of daze* I can give you clues about this guy- but my guess is that you have no idea who I am talking about (muahahahaha! Thus I have 2 big secrets now.)   1. I have known "of" him for awhile. Try, say, 3 years. 2. He's homeschooled too! (that may have given it away..lol) 3. Goes to the same church I do. 4. Completely sweet guy who is obsessed with cars.   I dunno what it is about him specifically... I just.. kinda like him. Alot. There is one small problem though, I think we both have a shy tick. Well, he may not be shy per say. Just shy around me?? I don't know. My mom seems to think I have a retraction force on guys, or, in other words, I scare the living crap out of them and make them feel like they can't approach me. Now- tell me, how is that possible? Well, she must be right... because lately I have been noticing that guys will just walk around me, sorta waiting for an opportunity for me to look up and acknowledge them. What's up with that?! Maybe I should ducktape my mouth into a smile position.. that away they don't feel so threatened. Good news though- the guy I like did lean out his car window and say bye to me whilst driving away from the church on Sunday. Maybe there is hope for me after all. lol.   So prom...  Yea, It's creeping up quite quickly. I want a date! *chants* I know you can have fun going stag and everything, but I don't want to go stag. Which probably doesn't matter, since, I am too chicken to ask anybody! *buries head in hands* That's all right though, maybe I will get lucky and either A. Overcome my chicken-ness and ask the guy I like, or B. The guy I like will ask me. (unlikely in both cases.) O well. Either way- I still get to make a speech! Woot! One.. which I need to write. Crap! More work! Gaaaaaaaaaaa.   Especially for tim.  I told tim that I would type 100 "woot woot's" so here are 50 tim!   woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot  woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot  woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot  woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot     I leave you with this..... it takes a mighty man to copy  paste
