Ps 31:1-5 In You, O'Lord, I put my trust; deliver me speedily; Be my rock of refuge, a fortress of defense to save me. For You are my rock and my fortress; lead me and guide me. Pull me out of the net which he has secretly laid for me, For You are my strength. Into your hand I commit my spirit; You have redeemed me, O Lord God of truth.  Ps 31:9-10,12 Have mercy on me, O Lord , for I am in trouble; My eye wastes away in grief, Yes, my soul and my body! For my life is spent with grief, my strength fails bcos of my iniquity. And my bones waste away. I am like a broken vessel.  Ps31:14-15,17-18 But I trust in You, O Lord; "You are my God." My times are in Your hand; deliver me from the hand of my enemies. Let the wicked be ashamed; let them be silent in the grave. Let the lying lips be put to silence.  Ps 31:24 Be of good courage, And He shall strengthen your heart, All you who hope in the Lord.  This is the third day without you. Have we ever not talked for 3 days? Never. Your passiveness has shown me clearly that you too know that you cannot give me what I want and it is true that you treat me like dirt. That was why you said, "Sorry, I disappointed you." Many times, I was tempted to ask you. Why? Why are you doing this to me? You promised you wouldn't be like him.  You promised to protect me and never let me be hurt again.  What is it that made you change? Why do you not want to be with me?  Is it something about me? Or is it just you? I am trying... Very hard indeed. To let go of you and all the promises you've made.  You gave me a dream. And you took it away. That's what you did.
