His name is Michael Burk.  I met him on the cruise, and he is the most wonderful guy I believe I've ever met in my entire life. (No offense, Josh and Will) He's from Indiana, and I miss him like no other.  I think I've cried for almost 18 hours straight now for lack of seeing him (You tease me about that and I'll kick your ass till you can't sit down).  Oh, um, in case your wondering, um, yes we're going out (took a real genius to figure out that one)  He plays football, dresses kind of like a prep, but doesn't act like one at all.  Hmmmm....what else to say...I don't know.  I just want yall to get to know him, I guess.  So tell me what you think.  Yay or nay???  And no "I don't cares" Vote one way or another.  I'm taking all the Mitch posts off of here.  In case you haven't guessed, I didn't meet him.  Met a better guy instead.  After I met Michael, I could not have cared less who I did and didn't meet.  I'll tell you more about the cruise later, if I can think of anything else worthwhile.
