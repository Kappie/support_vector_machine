Anyways, here in about an hour I have to do a monologue for Drama 2.  I'm kinda nervous but I'm ready to get it over with.  I'm doing Annie's opening scene singing "Maybe," the only problem is that I can't exactly sing. Oh well I just want to get it over with. I think I already wrote about that in an earlier entry but I don't remember.  I have to work tonight :( blah  I overslept this morning.  I left my house at like 7:45.  I wasn't late, though.  That was only because Ms. Hager wasn't in the classroom.  I guess it was my lucky day.  I'm going to try and not miss any days this year.  Not because I want to go to school but because I don't want to take any finals.  I don't know about having no tardies though.  That'll be a tough one to stick with.  I can't help it, I love to sleep.  The first home football game is tomorrow.  No surprise, but I don't get to go because I have to work.  It's like 3 hours away anyways so it's not that big of deal.  But next week is the first home one and I better be able to go.  Then the week after that is Harrodsburg.  I'll DEFIENTELY (I don't think I spelled that right) will be at that one.  We voted on a senior trip yesterday.  I voted for New York but then added Disney World.  I don't know if it's going to go through or not.  I hope so at least.  I would love to go to New York with all my buds from school. That would be awesome. Well, I don't know much else to talk about.  I guess that's enough for this entry. Until later...
