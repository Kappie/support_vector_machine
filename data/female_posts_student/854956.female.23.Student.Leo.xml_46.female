Last night she wanted a drink of water.  Instead of picking up the glass and drinking (like normal), she just leaned her mouth on the glass which was on the table, and leaned it enough to get a sip!  OMG!  That's so lazy.  And was so funny.  We were all on a sugar high.  I guess that happens when you have lotsa frosting and stuff around to eat.  Anyhow, I believe I'm going to see  urlLink Chicago  tonight.  Ya know... Richard Gere, Renee Zelwegger, and Catherine Zeta-Jones.  And it's a musical!  I'm so glad that musicals are coming back.  I just got my car inspected... that was... BORING!  In other news, I start school a week from today.  Am I ready to hit the books again?  NO!  What else...?  Oh, I am going to Houston on Friday-Sunday.  My brother got me and him a ticket to see  urlLink Blast!  in Houston for my Christmas and his Birthday.  I should probably buy him a cake or something.  He'll be 30.  I should really rub it in that he's getting old!  :-)  I guess I'm getting older, too, though.  Anyway, yeah, so I'll be gone this coming weekend.  I'll be hanging with my brother, and seeing his new apartment.  It should be a good weekend.  Then the following weekend, Wolf and I are going to Blast! in San Antonio.  My brother and my Mom didn't really communicate about their Christmas presents.  :-/  But it turned out good for me...!  I get to see an awesome show TWICE!  Anyhow, so I think I have 20 Jan off from school.  So I may stay on in Austin or something (since I'll have to take Wolf back on Sunday... maybe I'll just stay til Monday...).  Anyhow, not much else going on... except, I met a guy on TSO... and he's really nice.  His name's Zack, and he is convinced that I'm his soul mate.  We're a lot alike.  But alike in the way that it's like I'm his other half.  It's odd.  He lives in North Carolina... and he's joked about coming to visit.  But for some reason, I think he's SERIOUS!  Weird... we'll see.  Wouldn't that be weird if something happens there...? HAHA.  3 years down the road he and I get married, and have a kid on the way... WEIRD!!!!  Anyhow... not much else to say now... but I'll post something later.       urlLink  postCount('6Jan2003');
