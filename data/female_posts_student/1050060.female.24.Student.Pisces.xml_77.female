Well i needed another course to be a full time student so i thought i could do this psych course. Well lets say that i did so much better in psych in college. I really think the teacher is not so great. Oh well i will get it one day. I also have a french test this after noon and i think i will do well on it. All i ask is to pass.    Better news   The weather is hot hot hot. Its like +2 outside and it so nice to be out there. We also have no classes on Friday because it Chancellor's day. What in the heck is Chancellor's day? If anyone knows please tell me. Anyways i have to get going. I have a french test to do. Wish me luck! Have a nice day! Take Care!
