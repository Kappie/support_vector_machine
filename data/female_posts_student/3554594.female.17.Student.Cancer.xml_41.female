I don't promise to ask you to stop...  But I can run with you.   If one day you don't want to listen to anyone...  Call me.  I promise to be there for you.  And I promise to be very quiet.   But if one day you call...  And there is no answer...  Come fast to see me.  Maybe I need you.  Or maybe something has happened to me   If I ever ignored you. I'm Sorry...   I maybe out of my mind if i do Or something is really wrong if that happens I'm Sorry...   If I ever made you feel bad or put you  down.  I'm Sorry...   Don't ever forget that! Through bad times  and good,  I'll always be here for you.   I am Sorry...  For everything wrong I've ever done.     I'm writing this because what if tomorrow  never comes?    What if inever get to say good-bye or give a  u a BIG hug?     What if i never get to say I'm sorry or I  love you one last time??   Because what if tomorrow never comes?     I LOVE YOU! ...Pamela Wong Hui Mei..my hunnie...my love
