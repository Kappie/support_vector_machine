I just don't want to believe it, So I pretend that it's not true, Because I can't let you see the hurt, And what I'm going through.  Everytime I see your face,  It hurts me deep inside, I have to hold back all the tears, And they're getting hard to hide.  I wish I could just let it out, And show you how I feel, But instead I guess I'll smile, And make believe it's real.
