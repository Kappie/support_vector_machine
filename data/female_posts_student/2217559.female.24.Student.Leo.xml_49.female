Sorry, guys, it's been busy, of course I have made some friends on board as well and time just completely flies on this ship.  Let's see what's happened since my last blog - -   I got my next assignment and sign off date here. I sign off of this ship on May 29th and will head home for 2 months. Then back to the Century doing the eastern/western caribbean from July 28th until January-ish.  Our ship will be on a 7 day run but will do both sides of the caribbean every other week. Some of our ports include: Ochos Rios, St. Maartin, Bahamas, San Pedro - really nice caribbean ports. I am very excited. Mexico is, uh, well, getting a little boring. Fortunately, my curren ship is doing a repositioning in March and we will be leaving out of San Francisco going to Catalina Islands, Monterrey  Cabo again. Then May 1st we will be doing Alaska again. Not bad for one contract. I will be able to be on the Alaskan cruise probably a month and then I will head home.   We are all glad to have survived the holidays. On our christmas cruise we had over 450 children on board and I wanted to kill myself. Kids are such terrors, I swear. We had teenagers all over the ship and even one 18 year busted in our a room with 6 guys (I don't think I need to go into details at this point. I will let your imagination go on this one.)  The New Year's cruise was awesome though. All of our passengers had to be 21 and most all were younger in age, party people. The casinos were packed every night. The crew drank a lot last cruise -we were all a litle shocked when we got our bar bill last week. Whew!  Talk about some depressed people, do we even remember Christmas/New Years?? Hahaha.   Today, Lisa and I headed out to Cabo and rented Jetskis. We were out on the ocean for an hour just jumping waves, drinking tecate and basking in the sun. It was blast. We circled our ship, took photos of the islands and rock formations. It was really fun. We came back to the ship and have been blah since. We were planning to have a Shell sisters night but I don't know if we will make it. I am drinking coffee right now, trying to wake up. Tomorrow we are in Mazatlan which means - our surfing lessons day. We go to the beach there and hook up with this mexican guys who teach us how to surf. It's fun because they run the parasailing boats too so, we can do that if we want. It's kind of boring to do it a lot though. Hahaha. We will contineu to learn how to surf for a fewhours, drink some beers and come back to the ship.  Our usual.   We just got a new Assistant Hotel Manager (the 3rd since I arrive in November), a staff captain, safety officer, navigational officer- lots of new people on board. All the others have gone on vacation now. These guys are really tough.  The drummer on the ship got fired in San Diego. Apparently he sucked. I felt bad though because I had hung out with him a few times and I didnt get to say goodbye. Cool guy, just a crappy drummer I guess.  The tranzy has been given me drama mama. She's sooo crabby and I hate working with her.  Fortunately, my office is located in a different spot now and I don't have to deal with her quite as much. So moody, I swear. I think she's transfering ships soon though. Someone promoted her to group coordinator from guest relations officer - all of the girls in the office have our thoughts about how this happened....  Yeah, we are sailing no! The sky is beautiful right now. It's been sort of cloudy today in Cabo but the sunset is still gorgeous. I love the susnets/sunrises on board. You really feel the beginning and close of each day. The reflection of the sun and moon on the water is just indescribable.  I saw dolphins today while we were jetskiing. It was really cool - they were right next to my jetski. Lisa and I tried to get some photos but it was difficult as we were just learning how to drive those suckers.  Nontheless, it was cool.   What else....work is going good. Just staying busy and meeting tons of people. This week we have a well known writer on board from the San Diego Tribune and I am trying to spend as much time with her as possible. She's doing a write up on Celebrity and so I have been escorting her, introducing her to everyone. It's fun - she's a really nice woman.  I just found out that probably within the next few months my title could change to Public Relations Director.  It would be a salary increase and of course will look phoenominal on a resume for a land-based job. I am pretty siked - I hope they decide to go that route.   Okay, this blag has turned into a novel. I hope everyone is doing well. I am looking forward to a big bash when I get back to Austin. We will have to go out bar hopping after my solid 3 days of hibernation with Jennifer.  Lots of love your way,  Shelly
