I am going to the beach with my girlfriends and we are going to soak up some sun and breath some fresh air.  It's so strange. You would think i would go out on deck more often but I just never do when I am on the ship.  For the most part I am sitting at my desk or in the dining hall visiting with guests. I had dinner with the penthouse guests last night during second seating. Formal wasn't so great last night but oh well. Right now we have a reunion cruise and almost all of our passenger are over 60. Tough crowd for sure. Sometimes I look at them and wonder what it will be like to be their age. Some of them are just the sweetest people I have ever met. Then you have the ones that should never come on a cruise because it's never going to make them happy. The miserable ones.   Thank you Jennifer for my CD. I love this CD.  Jen made me a cd before I left and it's just awesome. I listened to it almost every day but sometimes it just really kicks me in the head and makes me think about home. It's a nice retreat from the complaining guests, woman chatter behind my desk. I just put my headphones on and I am suddenly in a different world, my world, back at home.  I remember listening to this cd in Jen's car, the night before I left Austin.  We must have sat in her driveway for an hour just talking, laughing, crying, all the while listening to this cd.  Listen to me, I am going on and on about home. I do miss home. Time goes by pretty fast here though because I am so busy. I can hardly believe that I have already been here almost a month.  Unfortunately, I have discovered that a lot of people do not get to leave on their leave date.  More often than not their contract is extended. Maybe a month, a week, a day. But some people do 8 months when their contract was only 6.  And sometimes vacation is cut short.  That kind of sucks but I guess we will see.  I will keep everyone posted.  Merry Christmas, peeps. We just got our decorations in San Diego and so the ship sort of feels like a holiday. Not much though. Mail takes forever for me to get - apparently like a month or something. That sucks because I will be receiving christmas cards/gifts in January. But it's okay. I think the ship will have a special dinner for the crew. At least I hope so.  Okay, enough. I have to run and quit blabbering. Miss you all so much and I can't wait to see you.  I hopee everyone is doing well. You are all in my thoughts and prayers.   Shell
