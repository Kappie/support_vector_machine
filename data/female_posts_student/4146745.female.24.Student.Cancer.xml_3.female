Okay so he brought a soccer ball into Kimo and said "I'm gonna kick it to you".       So I asked him the follow:      What do you with a football and he said "pass it",   I asked him what you do with a baseball and he said "hit it with a bat" and I asked him what you did with a basketball and he said "shoot it".       It was so cute that he knew what you did with the balls and that they were all right. I think it was the cutest thing. We do have an all star here :)
