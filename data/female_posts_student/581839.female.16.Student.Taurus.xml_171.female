Margaret is gone, and now mary is gone. and my mom too. soon i'm going somewhere out in texas, where i don't know, and i'm leaving for about a week. I'm worried what will happen to jordan and zack, like, will they be incredibly insecure with everyone around them leaving? I'm also freaked because i'll be left home with my dad and maureen, and the two kids, and with all those people, i'm bound to have no privacy, or sanity, in my life. I can already tell that i'm going to go crazy with maureen around me all the time, and i'll have no big sister to whine to, or complain to, and i won't have someone like my mom to drive me away, or get me that coke i needed, and i won't have that sister around who will take me to mcdonalds one morning, just because she wanted to suprise me. i mean, i am totally depressed about all this. i have a toga party tonight but i don't know if i can have fun there, just because i miss everyone so much. i don't think that i'll have THAT great of a time. we're going to see spy kids 3-D again today, and i hope that can divert my mind from any thought of family. i have to take a shower, and i have to clean my room, and i have to do my homework, but mary isn't here any more! and it makes me soo soo soo sad. and my mom isn't here, and margarets not here, and i feel so lost and alone.... darn this. i don't know if i like being the oldest. julia
