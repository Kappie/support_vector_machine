Mrs. Wells is a fucking bitch and I can't stand her. I hate the way she talks, I hate her voice, I hate looking at her. Fatass bitch.  Fucked up the pizza last night because I'm too stupid to figure out that if I take the number of carbs per slice, multiply it by 5, then divide it by the number of slices I did end up cutting then I could figure out how many per slice.  I tell you I'm not good for anything sometimes.  Excuse me for fucking shit up.  I'm not going to go on because I'm already in a shitty mood.   I AM FUCKING EXHAUSTED AND I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.   Fuck this shit.
