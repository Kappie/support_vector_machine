I was surprised about the shark attacks these last few weeks and all I got from skin diving was a deep cut on my foot.  Consider myself lucky.  And now a little bit of Yates for everyone...      To My Heart, bidding it have no Fear       Be you still, be you still, trembling heart;  Remember the wisdom out of the old days:  Him who trembles before the flame and the flood,  And the winds that blow through the starry ways  Let the starry winds and the flame and the flood  cover over and hide, for he has no part  witht the proud, majestical multitude.
