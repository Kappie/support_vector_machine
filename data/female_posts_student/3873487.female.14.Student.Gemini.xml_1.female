    Mood: completely wiped out by love.  
    ___I can’t understand why I wanted to see   Brandon   that bad, even when I tried to know that there would be a lot of consequences at the end. When I first got up this morning, I wanted to dress “sexy but sophisticated” just for him, and of course, to look good at Grant’s party. I mean… why?!??! Why couldn’t I just think of being myself 24/7 then being someone else’s image? Looking good for a cause that isn’t worth it, especially if you know it, just isn’t right. When Gilbert told me to sit tight and that we’ll head over to   Brandon  ’s after he eats, I swear my heart almost did a flip. But why?!?! I mean not on the fact that yes,  I   DO  want to see him, but on the fact that I still wanted to see someone that made me think so fucking much about them. I am not a person to linger on stupid thoughts for too long, because I believe in being able to proceed and grasp every opportunity that makes its way right in front of your face. If you waste your time with such pathetic shit, your holding yourself back from knowing what could have happened if you took that lil risk that could have indeed changed everything from yourself, to your morals, etc, so yea, my heart waited patiently to see the face that I’ve thought of for so long, especially when it’s a face of a former boyfriend that basically changed you so damn much. I wanted everything to be like what it had last time, that beautiful weekend… but of course, can the past really happen again? Especially when I’ve been looking forward to it for so long and blocking out what is important to me right now??  NAHHHH , never. But it felt so good, yet terrible when our eyes met the humorous moments of him being crazy. I sat on my regular spots, near the edge of his trampoline, watching his black figure jump around and talk and joke. They were playing   Brandon  ’s version of Yu-Gi-Oh dueling. It consisted of you putting down any of you cards, then him “ frying ” your ass with his trap cards, monster cards, and magic cards. So at the end, you’d have a big pile of cards, in the center for claming. Haha, it was really funny, and we hooked eyes a couple times, and it felt great. Of course, it will feel great that moment!!!!! But how the hell will it feel now, that I’m writing this and thinking back of today’s events?!?!?? I feel  terrible . I feel  stupid  that I even got myself and my heart into the stupid business of dating  again !!!!    WHY   !??!?!? I’m stupid!!! Dating was and is the   worst   thing I’ve ever experienced!!!! It’s  always  either person getting  hurt , and this time it happens to be   me  . And I can’t even describe the way I’m feeling right now, I just want to hug and hold  my   boo  real tight right now. And guess who I want to be  my   boo ?  Brandon .  Why ? Because he made me feel so much, experience so much, and learn so goddamn much. And now I just can’t let go. I can, and I probably shall, but just for now, I just want to feel. Feel the happiness and twirls my heart were doing when we connected eyes, feel the pleasurable kisses he gave me,   I JUST WANT TO FEEL  ! Not think, thinking take too much of me for one, and it let’s you dream, which is bad because it isn’t real. You’re imagining, not living. And when we were walking back to Gilbert’s, I felt the precious moments I was living when we were holding hands and waiting to get my first kiss later that night. It felt dream-ish… The results of that were bad though, because I’m sitting here, writing about what has happened these couple of weeks, and listening to  Alicia Keys’ Feelin U, Feelin Me . And when we entered the house and headed for the basement, I felt as if I was a shadow on looking the couple making out on the one person couch. Is that me?!  HELL   YES  it WAS, and I will never damn forget the aching in the pit of my stomach when he nibbled on my earlobe, or the silent whispers. When we sat down to start playing Starfox, I tried to use my mental prediction of where he might sit just so I could be near him and day dream. But that didn’t work, it even back fired. He sat all the way down the row of chairs, and the farthest one away from me.  DAMN  my mental predictions, which are usually right. I was surprised that that had happened, but it never showed. Haha, it was funny when yee-kow-fuu walked downstairs and I looked right into Brandon’s eye and told him to say “ Hi ”. He did, but it sounded weird, he said, “ Good afternoon Mr. Luong ”. I thought that was hilarious because it sounded so unlike him, but hey at least he’s (…trying to…) repair the social image that my uncle has of him. We started to play Uno Attack, and let’s just say he’s not as dumb and clueless as I thought he might have been. We won and lost pretty much on the same level, but the whole first segment of our matches was “ out of mercy ”. I was  MAD  and  pissed  at him, so I guess I decided to take it out on him in the Uno games. I mean what could be better for me than silent feuds that leave the other person wondering if you’re ok? And I  K    NOW    he  K    NOW    ’s    that when I’m silent, it means I’m thinking. But after a lil break, and playing again, but with Gilbert, my silent feud faded as Brandon kicked our butts first, then second round, I kicked all their butts! Gilbert, however, never won while Brandon was playing… ( hmmmmm ) intimidation maybe? At 5:30-ish Jamon and Brandon went home and that’s when the boredom started. Not until like 9:15-ish did they come back for Grant’s little party. I was praying and wishing like hell that they’d change their mind to let Brandon come to Grant’s party. And, like so many other times, when I was out of hope, and I thought maybe all luck was lost, and  ALSO  when I asked Grant about it he said, “ DEF    INIT    ELY     NO , because he was being so mean to me this morning.”……………………………………………   it happens  . There he was, standing at the door with Jamon, at first I thought he wasn’t even there, because all I heard was Jamon’s voice. I also noticed how different a black person looks behind different clothes. I did really like Brandon with his first outfit on the day I met him, and now when he came in with a green, white, and yellow jersey, black pants, and a yellow band around his head, I  S    WEA    R   …. That man looked cute. “ Does Gene have competition with Brandon? ” HELL  YES . I mean they’re both 15, it’s just one failed 7 th  grade. There’s not much of a difference ( no I don’t want to get into ALL the DAMN differences ).  Brandon … he’s perfect for me, it’s just because he’s black and his black side comes along with him. I mean the pimp, lookin good, rapping future, etc. All that, and I think that is perfect for me.  Gene … he’s (… I think …) too damn slow to get the fact that I’ve liked him, and that he’s not experienced.  Experience  is  BAD , because it shows how much they’ve ( or could have .) done it before with other people before you. But if it came to who can make your first kiss so remember-able and make you feel exactly how they want you to feel ( pleasure, good… etc),  experienced is definitely favored. I guess I’d rather the guy have had their first kiss so that they can at least know what to expect and what to make the other person feel when they kiss you. Remember that lil white lie I told? About how my grandma doesn’t exactly get along with Gilbert’s mom, thus that is why I do not see them often? Well when my family got to Gilbert’s house, he asked me about that, and I quickly thought up of another white lie. I simply said that it’s all alright now, and that that isn’t even the grandma I was talking about. I know, I know… really bad story that didn’t fit together as  piece-fully  as I expected ( haha get it ?  Yes me trying to be humorous as this blog gets longer and longer ). After that it was more Uno, and cherishing the moments with the future rapper. Just before I was about to leave though, just when I was standing at the door already  O    UTSI    DE   … I had the greatest desire to run back in there, give Brandon a hug for “that weekend” and for being my bf. I also just wanted to tell him to become that rapper, along with wishing his grandmother wellness and inspiration for always, and just a big ass  TH    ANK    S   . But all I did manage to do was run down the stairs ( check .), hug Grant and wish him a last happy birthday ( where the hell this come from? Ain’t this a lil late ?), and a poke for Brandon, telling him to not do anything illegal ( that was GREAT. What did we plan earlier?? You  HUG  him, not  poke  him and tell him that!!! stupid… now are you wondering what would have happened if you did the hugging plan and not the poking plan ???!). So yes, now I AM wondering what would have happened if I had done that, the scenario (my internal mental image) would have been a kissing scene, not a pondering scene. So even if I had done it, it wouldn’t have mattered really since I won’t be seeing him for the next 1 or so. I asked Grant if he’s taken, yes duh, and I think her name is Jill. And that was it. No more Brandon. NO more memories, just a broken heart, a head-full of cherished moments and bad memories, and a very confuse and lonely soul. Is there any good side to this? Or is this what I’ve deserved for wasting time with a young blood like him? I have no clue, nor do I wish to ponder on that for too long… gottah head forward to the next brick wall. Looks like the last one is almost into crumbs and bits, but it’s still there. Crazy how in about 2 weeks I’ll look back and see nothing but dust and fog, no person, no nothing. Thanks Anh… for all your help and understanding for what I’m going through, even if I’m ranting…
