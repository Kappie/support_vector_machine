There was a Conference Championship in that Uniform, and a gave saving dive this year!  I'm going to miss North Fast-Pitch!   BREWER GAME!!!  So, the early bird DOES catch the worm!  We got there soo damn early, that we saw the end of Brewer batting practice, and...GOT AUTOGRAPHS!!!  Hell Yeah!  So, I easily was the only one around...and asked Lyle Overbay for his, and then I went to the other side of the dugout to attempt to get Geoff Jenkins', but no luck...he like ignored every attempt I made!  Oh well...Then I got Wes Helms (too bad he sucks and I can't stand the guy in general), and Right fielder Brady Clark's.  Then...my most faluable(probably in a couple years), Pitcher Victor Santos!  And then I left the dugout area cause I was being squished...then as I sit down in our Amazing Seats..who comes out of the dugout?... Scott Podsednik!  OMG, I missed the greatest opprotunity ever!  And...he plays my position, and is the most goregous player on the whole team!  Ahh...I was pissed!  So, I figured I could get those on the 13th when we go again!   So these seats we had were amazing!  Right next to the brewer dugout, 5th row, right behind the on deck circle!  I almost Died!  I was in heaven, seeing all of their faces soo close!  I had never been that close to team members in Miller Park!  So...to make the night even better than it already was...in the 3rd inning, when Capuano struck out the batter and ended the inning,  Chad Moeller , the catcher, runs over to the dugout...and sees me waving my glove as I go, "Hey Chad over here!"  And He looks, smiles, and tosses it to me, and lands in my glove!!! I then felt like 22,560 people were watching me, jealous of course, as I grabbed the priceless ball!   Ok, the game in general, if anyone cares, was ok i guess...we lost 12-3.  it was a pretty ugly last few innings!  Couple Pitcher changes, couple home runs...but hey...I still had a freakin' blast!  Down side to the night...  It poured allllllll night!  So, as I run out to my car... in my mind going,  god I hope I didnt leave any windows open?   So, of course...my sunroof was cracked open, you know, popped up kind of...and my seats, consol, cd's--ARE SOAKING!  I was so pissed I said Fuck like 20 times on the way home.  Oooh the drive home....SUCKED, the roads were so wet, you could barely see in the lane lines...I was freaking out and so was Nicole, but we were fine!   Tomorrows Game Plan: Play at Bluemound CC for a memeber guest Best Ball, and, if its not a soaked course, will most likely come home then!  I have to be in Wauwatosa at 7:15 tomorrow morning...and thats in like 7.5 hours!  So, you know what that means...have to go to bed before 2 like I normally do!  So it was an awesome day/game and I cant wait to play some G-O-L-F tomorrow bright and early!  See ya then!
