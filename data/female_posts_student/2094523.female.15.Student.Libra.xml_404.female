I am a girl but i hate girls, infact i wish i lack those girly characteristics such as gossipness, prissiness, and bitchiness. I'm not as horny as u think i am, infact i dont wana get fingered or eaten out and i dont wana give a handjob nor blow job, infact i think dicks are really really gross. I don't even want to see one, but no i'm not a lesbian. I don't like the kinky stuff and All i want is a guy that is funny, nice, and respects me for who i am, and understands when im joking and when i'm not. I do wanna get kissed, I do like to flirt, and i do like to talk dirty but the truth about me is i'm more talk than do. I don't want to have sex or get down on you . The truth about me is I think life is too short to take seriously, so therefore I'm barely ever serious. I can stand mac, but i really miss crestwood. I hate it when peopel swear too much, and i hate actions movies with a few exceptions. I hate rap music, and I really liek mushrooms. I love leaving things to the imagination, and I have a flaw with taking things too far. I will accept your flaws if you respect mine, i will love you, if you will love me, if you lack respect then fuck you. I hate webcams but i love adam brody. I've never been drunk, and I've never done weed. I've never been to a real party, and I don't care to either. I'd rather stay home curl up and watch sappy movies all night long, because yes i am a prissy girl. I don't like extreme activities and I'd rather play the field safe. I do like my self, but sometimes i wish i were different. I'm low maintenence, and I don't expect gifts. I don't liek expensive jewelery, or expensive chocolate or flowers. I don't care for expensive dates or the car you drive. I love hot guys but I don't care much for buffness, abs are good but rippling muscles aren't. Infact I think the sterotype of buffness is dead because i don't like buff boys. I'm simple and easy to please. Truth of the matter is I think confidence is the most attractive feature, and those that don't know how hot they are are even hotter. and as much as I say I hate you, I've got it really bad for you.
