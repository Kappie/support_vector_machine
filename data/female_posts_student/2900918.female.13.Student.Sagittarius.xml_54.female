I'm sick of always hearing, All those sad songs, on the radio All day, it is there to remind, An over sensitive guy, That he's lost and alone, Yeah I hate our favourite restaurant, Our favourite movie, Our favourite show We would, stay up all Through the night, We would laugh and get high And never answer the phone  I can't forgive, can't forget, Can't give in What went wrong, 'Cause you said this was right? You f***ed up my life  I'm sick of always hearing, Sappy love songs, on the radio This place, it's f***in' Cursed its plague And I can never escape When my heart it explodes  I can't forgive can't forget, Can't give in What went wrong, 'cause You said this was right? You f***ed up my life  I'm kicking How fiercely at the world around me What went wrong? I'm kicking How fiercely at the world around me What went wrong? I'm kicking How fiercely at the world around me What went wrong? I'm kicking How fiercely at the world around me What went wrong? I'm kicking
