SO we usually get up around 11 or 12. FYI skylar is a youngin i babysitt for, she is more like a lil sister, she was Nate Faulkners lil sis;who passed last sept.... anyways, so we get up and do w/e then i get a shower and decide we need to go to the mall. my best friend ashley called while i was walkin out the door, and she decided she wanted to go...so we go and i buy Cassie her bday present, which is a vibrater with lotion and shit, and this heller card, says,"where is dildo?" and u have to find it... shes a perv like that, not me lol.  then we were gettin a slushy from snoBiz and mikey( the mall midgett) came runnin up and asked ashley to play tag, she rjected the idea, but Mikey insisted she played. so he chased after her around teh fuckin mall for like 20 mins. i was rollin on the ground laughin my ass off with skylar.   i just got home from Cassie's like an hour ago, we made signs for her bday, "rock out with your cock out" nice huh? we went to dollar general and got accused of stealing fuckin poster boards, truth was the old bitch behind the counter was on crack, we didnt steal....this time. so i hung out at cassies and read this sex tips book its pretty intresting! then i called my mom to see if i could just crash at cassies crib and of course, she said no... then we fought a lil and i said fuck it.   me and mom always fight, its like we enjoy it in a sick way. its over some gay shit most of the time too. i seriously just think she hates me most of teh time, how can u bitch at someone u love soo much? i guess its a retorical ? to me too.. i am a bitch i know it.. o well.   so...... my dads sick again and it really sucks b/c there is no shit i can do for him, for you ppl that dont know, my dad is a hydro-sa-folic? its like he has a brain tumor kinda.. and he has had it his whole life.. he is alot better these days and not living in a hospital or charter. i love my dad more than anything. he is the best person i know. and i dont think he knows that, and i wish i could tell him, but im really bad at bein affectionate w/ ppl, mostly my rents. i dk why?    i reallly want a cig. i so called "quit" like a month ago, but why give up something you like? im soo cheap tho' i hate wastin my money on them, but yet there a so called necessity.   so tommrow is cassies bday and it will be heller... i dk if we wil be drinkin or not tho' cuz her rents, and i cant get hammered, cuz i have to go home, only b/c im leavn for FL. sat at lik 5 in the morn. damn. i would love to get drunk...hell smokin the reefer dont sound bad either, but the last time i did that was spring break with my gurl Leah.
