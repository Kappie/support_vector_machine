Bill is telling me that he wants a new life, but I understand why. I'm fucking everything up, and I can never do anything right anymore. I'm always making bad choices..and, I always apolojize for it. Bill is like "you say that you're sorry for always making bad choices, but when are you going to actually stop making them?" and...he had a good point. I guess I feel like I have no control over my own actions, and I guess I do. I just need to stop being so stupid.   I wish that I knew how to put pictures on here. I want another new SKIN...yet again, I'm not happy with this one. :-/, I'll never be happy. Way too picky...*sigh*   Anyway, Shit sucks at the moment, and bill is upset and wants this "new life" (without me) and stuff because he's always being fucked with..but when he keeps telling me that he doesnt want to be with me then my mind gets fucked over..badly. I dont know what the fuck to expect anymore. We could be kissing, and the next thing I know we could be fighting. It's insane. I mean, I love Bill with all my heart, but shit is growing hard. I want a baby really bad...and I'm so mad at myself for saying that..but I want one soo badly.   I'm kind of upset about the world and society. I was talking to my grandparents and they agreed that this world is a very cruel and unsafe place. I asked them if they enjoyed watching the news, and they said.. that they guessed so. They didnt say yes, and they didnt say no..just "I guess so". Every time you turn on the news something bad is happening..but that's our world..this is our so called "safe" place. We walk over to wherever Saddam is because he's killing innocent people, but I'm sure that there are just as many innocent killings here as there are there. Think about it..how many people are murdered in a month in our country? How many people are in jail here? A lot. We have no business going over there and sticking our greedy little noses into their shit. WOOO Our country is wealthy...big fucking deal. They brag and shit..but look at what we're spending all our fucking money on. How much money do you think goes into the fucking military and shit. It's such bull shit. To tell you the truth, I've never thought about any of this before now..just that our world was shitty..I never really had input on it..i guess I do now. But anyway, back to the news story, we were watching a news..and this is my impression of a news person. "6 people were murdered today..(blah blah)" *at the end of what they're saying, the flash this little fake smile. The weather man..smiles, and you can tell that it's fake. He's like "We're expecting a severe thunderstorm. Try not to drive on the roads much incase a telephone wire comes down on you" *smiles*..I just made that up..but come on, think about it. I'm rambling for nothing.  leaving now...  "It kills me that we fall apart every day it seems I break your heart I wish I could open my mind instead of my mouth..then you'd know what my thoughts are really about" -me- :-/
