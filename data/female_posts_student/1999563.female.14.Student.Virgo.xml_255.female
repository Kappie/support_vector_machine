She was like "well, first I got drunk! It made it so much better!"    She was 14.  My heart snapped.  Broke in half.  I just started to cry. The tears quickly streams down my shaking face. This is an epidemic.  A bad one.  As I sit here I just cry.  I wish I could help these people, but I can't.  I wish there was something, anything i could do.  So I might as well make YOU a good person and give you the big lecture.   First, s ex before marrige is absolutely wrong. Why?  First, it says in the bible. And, do you want to make a commitment like this? Your just giving your heart away, sure it will give you a little temporary happiness but then its gone and your broke again.  So, ( i know..I shortened it. A lot.)  Anywho, I have a quiz for YOU!  Are you ready for se x?  Question one:  Are you married?  If you answered no, your not ready!!  Bingo.  Thats it!  Remember: everything your doing now is preparing you for eventual marrige, so please, save it for marrige!
