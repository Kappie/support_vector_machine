I mean really, Justin Timberlake and Miss Jackson freak dancing on tv was...well...AMERICA!!  American is just searching everywhere for love. Sadly enough- most find it in the opposite gender.  They think they can finally complete there life so they will do anything to get a boyfriend/girl friend.   Some find it in popularity.    They think that if there the hottest girl, with the trendiest clothes that finally they will be happy.   To put it lightly, all of that is crap.  Crappity crap.   Beileve that GOD is the only source of ULTIMATE love in this universe.  Grasp his love, take a hold of his mercy.   I am completely positive your life will be a heck of a  lot better.
