Half of us cried. It was just so good. Then we went out to waffles. I couldn't eat half of what I ordered because I just felt awful. My stomach hasn't been liking me for the past couple days. (it's not alone) Then mark and I had a very long talk while he was taking me home. It was lovely. It made me remember why I consider him to be such a good friend of mine. Even if his car does smell like nilla wafers. I am very tired now, but seeing as how I had two cups of coffee at waffle house, I don't think I'll sleep. I'll probably just read till 2 then fall asleep with my light still on. It wouldn't be the worst thing that's happened to me today. Will miss amber. She goes back to college on sunday. Maybe will do something tomorrow. Hope tomorrow it good.   doubt it    about two minutes later... this blog says it's 12:32, but it's only 11:32... must figure out how to change that...
