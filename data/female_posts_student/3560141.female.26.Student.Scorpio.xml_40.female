It's hard for me to come to terms with the fact that my moods can be described as polar, bi- , tri-, or quadruple still yet to be judged....My highs are wicked highs, I can charm a fortune right out of a cookie, and noone or nothing can dent this feeling...My lows are gruesome lows, where I can walk hand in hand with anxiety attacks over the simplest of things, from grocery shopping to cooking, to working out in the gym...  It has been said that each student in this profession has some element of obsessive compulsive disorder...harping over details that eventually compel one to be unmoved from a single task..the sole reason that reading chapter after chapter until the exam is done seems realistic....  I wish I could find the courage sometimes to seek a psychiatrist, not for therapy, but just for their mere power to prescribe.  A mood stabilizer that would leave me baseline all the time...but the costs scare me...granted without insurance the prices can seem infinite, but what I really meant was that in the end...I would trade off the wicked highs too.  The lows at my age are recognizable as surmountable, as ending very soon, but at my age the highs also come with the thought of impending doom all the time.  I am also the type of person who becomes depressed without excitement, wrinkles in my linen, missing pieces in a puzzle, so with medication, I would end up depressed I think.  Imagine if I could never react appropriately, with sadness, anger, happiness, or ecstasy, if it all were somehow numbed.  I can't survive in a box without doors or an open top, I would suffocate, I have to be able to escape the norms in order to thrive....  What breeds a being like this...I know my character flaws, but I don't know where they come from?  how to prevent someone else from feeling like this?  See, at this very moment, things are so defined down to a timetable that I feel trapped, and therefore depressed.  I can't actually believe I did this but this morning I woke up late PURPOSELY...took my time, drank a cup of coffee as if I didn't have lips, spilt it on my shirt so I had to get dressed again, smoked a cigarette, and then jumped in my car and sped through traffic, weaving in and out...driving recklessly, running to my floor so as I wouldn't be late...slipped in ninja style...rushed through paper work that was over an hour late, but finished it so I could revel in my version of "living on the edge"...I could have potentially been yelled at, made to look like a fool, but I risked it so I could be prepared despite being late, so I could get a rush from the challenge...who does this....and is conscious of it??????
