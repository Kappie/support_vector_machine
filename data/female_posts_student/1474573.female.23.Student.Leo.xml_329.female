I had heard stuff about it and the main actor,  urlLink Peter Dinklage  in it but I didn't get to catch it in the theater.  It was probably one of the best movies I've ever seen.  However, its one of those movies where I can't explain WHY I loved it so much.  Maybe I have this thing for lonely people in films.  I think that's why I loved Lost in Translation, Far From Heaven and the like...   Funny...I'm also very drawn to closed-up people.  I want to 'figure them out' and maybe 'crack their shell'.  Sometimes I'm successful, sometimes not.  It's funny.  I guess the pseudo-psychologist in me is fascinated by the multifaceted.  I love those 'jack of all trades' types - people who are interested in everything, people who only open up just a little to give you a taste of all they have to offer.  Its great, because you know it could take a lifetime to get to know them, and as the years go by, there's so much more to learn about.  I married one of these types.  I've also befriended many of those types.  Life is good.  But I digress.  The movie is about a little person who lives this life of relative solitude.  He loves trains.  When his friend dies, he moves to a small town to be alone.  Turns out that ain't gonna happen.  There's this goofy hotdog vendor and this wacked out artist who can't seem to just leave him in peace.  It's so cute how they eventually break this dude's shell and how everything just seems to fall in place like it was meant to be.  This guy reminds me of someone I know. (you know who you are.)  Oh and  urlLink Patricia Clarkson  is in it and I just love huh.  She's like butta.    Please see this movie.
