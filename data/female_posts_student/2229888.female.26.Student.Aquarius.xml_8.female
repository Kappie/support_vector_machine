My 19 year old bro and I are best friends and we decided to go to college together (yeah i'm a procrastinator)  We thought, hey let's go to a community college, earn an associates degree and transfer to the NC School of the Arts (assuming we are accepted)for film making.   We were gonna attend a school in houston, but damn, the prices jumped from like $280 dollars for residents to $1400 for non residents . . . my mom had mentioned our moving to NC, and so i said, hey, why not? So my bro and I moved to NC that weekend. We're both majoring in pre-drama at the moment (whatever the hell pre-drama is).  I am partially grounded . . . really. . . i'm just chock-full of contridictions, and it usually confuses people . . . I had a wacko childhood that made me aware of so much stuff that I don't feel the need to conform, but I do feel a need to be childish . . .   David Spade(my fave comedian {I'm also a total Monty Python freak}) quoted something that made alot of sense to me: "If everyone sat around thinking about their lives, they would just bawl and bawl. I say, why do that when you can screw around?" mybe it isn't Frost, but it speaks to me . . .  I'm an outgoing person (most of the time) spontanious (most of the time) relatively entertaining (umm, most of the time) however I have a serious side that freaks people out . . .if I'm quiet it must mean I'm depressed or mad at somebody . . .   well that's... what people  think  anyway, but it just means i wanna be quiet, dammit! or i have something on my mind. You see, I get caught up in thinking about things (day dreaming) and i seem like a total ditz (don't ask me what day of the week it is!)ll stay up at night for hours, staring into the darkness, eyes wide open, begging my brain to shut up . . . (have you noticed my love of parentheses lazy to use spell check, I am>>     Oh yeah, that reminds me, I have almost completed a novel, I also have several children's books that a publisher will be checking out this monday {{{KROSS YER FINGERZ}}}
