Though Mr. F did send a camera with me to take pictures of communtiy events throughout the summer.  But I can handle that.  Camera's make me happy.  I also re-met an old Knowledge Bowl acquaintence, who is quite fun to talk to, except I negelcted to gleen his e-mail address from him, and with the help of google and hotmail, have located his profile, but alas no e-mail address to accompany.  Not really sure what to do next, so if anyone has an ideas let me know.  This is frusterating, I'm off to the Cities ina few days, and I don't believe I'll get ot see Abner before he heads off to college.  I'm kinda bummed, it's the beginning of the great friend decline.  Whoo hoo.  But life goes on. I"m now contemplating my senior pictures clothes, and hair styles.  I don't know what to do.  My mom wants one in my prom dress *sigh*.  I wanted one in my new green dress by the fountain in UND.  I don't know how that's going to go over with my mother.  I have a hunch this is going to cause the first big fight between my mom and I since maybe 9th grade.    Oh well, we've done so well for so long, it's about time.
