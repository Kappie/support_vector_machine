Lee was making [ot attempting to] a cake for his sister and he made this caramel icing which we proceeded to use the excess to make all caramel cookies--haha. We took awhile being very indecisive about what we were doing, but eventually headed downtown and got some gelado! YUMM! That was fun...minus those weird bugs. Drove around for awhile, again being decisive and playing games, then ended up back @ jen's hanging out on the trampoline talking. Maggie came over after work, alyson left, brad left, then lee drove me home! I was way too hyper to fall asleep really quick..but i eventually managed to...thankfully.  Today I worked from 945 to 3. Morning was okay 'cept grosjean was there...argh i hate when she's the supervisor. I hadta clean like crazy! Then Alli came in at 2 and we went on a food run while we got Blake to cashier [[who spent the morning flexing his pecs]] to wendy's and planet smoothie. Left work half and hour later and now I'm home!
