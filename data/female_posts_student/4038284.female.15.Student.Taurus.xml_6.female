I have to start my homework, but I can't be bothered yet. -makes a mental note- I have to do some RE coursework, Geography homework, and Maths coursework. Stupid homework.  This week, I shouldn't be online that much, because I should be going out a lot, because my dad is off work for a week...On Monday, I MIGHT be going to Flamingo Land, on Tuesday, I have my orthodontists, (stupid braces) and that's only how far we've got...should be going somewhere on Friday as well.  Nowt else to say really...I don't think they'll read this but happy birthday to Matthew and Thomas Mann ^^;
