I sat there poking it for like 10 minutes. At the end of those 10 minutes, not even  half  the blood was gone. Not even  3/4  of the blood was gone. So then I figured I might as well pull off the whole skin that covers the blood! And that worked! GO ME!  Saturday when Alex told me to write, I was too lazy so I just went to bed. Then last night, I actually got to it. I wrote I think 4 or 5 whole poems and I'm still working on two others. But it's so awesome because when I'm writing, hidden away in my room, my music blasting, and paper all over the floor is when I get into this  zone . It's just me and my words. I could never write a poem in a crowd of 200 people at a concert, like ones I write when I'm all by myself. Writing is such an amazing thing to me. It makes me so much happier. Even if I write a depressing poem, I'm soo happy because I got those depressed feelings  out of me.  And the music I listen to while writing, heavily influences my ability. Like when I first started writing last night, I was listening to the radio. I can't handle people talking [on the radio] because it messes up my concentration. Even listening to the music on the radio is hard because it all varies so much. And I try to stick to one type of music so I'm relaxed throughout the entire period of my writing. Usually I listen to Jimmy Eat World. I dunno, it's just  something  about their music. I love them! When I write all that matters is what I'm writing about. I don't care about everything else that's going wrong until I finish the poem I'm working on. And that's cool. I get like that in soccer too. When I'm playing, the only thing that matters is the game. When I'm pushing myself to the point of me wanting to die, I don't feel it until after I'm done pushing myself. I dunno, it's really cool to think that those two things (writing and soccer) are my escape from the real world. The things that I can run to when I'm in need. But I know that they quickly become things to  run from  when people put such  pressure  of them so they don't feel like escapes, they feel like  chores .
