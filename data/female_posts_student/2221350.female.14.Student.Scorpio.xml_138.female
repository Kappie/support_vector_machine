HAPPY ANNIVERSARY TO MEEEEE!  there are a ton of bracelets on my left wrist. Every time I find something that resembles a bracelet I slip it on and it stays there. Most of them are clear sparkly things I bought from a teeny bopper store in the mall. I don't take them off unless I'm giving one to somebody, which I do when I make a new friend. It's like my trademark, and I like to think that the owners of one of my precious bracelets are proud to wear them..   yesterday my sister and her friend Valerie chopped up some old clothes and sewed them back together, forming some of the most hideous garb I have seen since I went to steinmart with my mother((we all remember the speech about how the only thing that should wear lime green should be LIMES, correct?)) so, once I had gotten over the shock of seeing my violet satin bridesmaid's dress shredded and superglued to a pair of old blue jeans, I was able to laugh, and laugh, and laugh. Then I wrote a song about it, but I don't remember the words.  I have decided, with the help of everyone who's ever been around me when a bee has flown by, that I am entophobic. On Saturday I let myself get grounded because I was afraid to go in the garage and clean up something because there was a wasp in there. My mother pestered and bullied me about it, saying I was nuts and she couldn't believe I would rather be grounded than be near a wasp. I replied simply by saying that I didn't laugh at her when she was so afraid of crowds she couldn't go to the grocery store. ((for a while after she got off the drugs, she had some kind of withdrawal symptom that caused her to have panic attacks when she was in a place with more than a few people))... Well this really struck a chord, as she still gets a little nervous near huge crowds. So she's been totally nice about it.  What is the cause of Insect Phobia?   "Like all fears and phobias, Insect Phobia is created by the unconscious mind as a protective mechanism. At some point in your past, there was likely an event linking insects or bugs and emotional trauma((when I was 7, I was stung in the forehead by a hornet)). Whilst the original catalyst may have been a real-life scare of some kind, the condition can also be triggered by myriad, benign events like movies(("arachnophobia", the end of "the craft")), TV, or perhaps seeing someone else experience trauma((sister getting stung through her bathing suit while trying to turn off the waterhose after playing in the sprinkler and her head swelling up))"  that is just some thing I pulled off of google, but everything in (( )) is me. you see!!! I'm afraid of big flying bugs because they could sting me, small ones because they could fly in my ears or mouth, crawling ones because they might get into what I'm eating or do the same as small flying bugs, and all bugs in general because they are filthy disgusting creatures. It's getting to the point where I won't even go outside anymore for fear of a bug, and I don't know what to do.   ((current noise: Mrs. Robinson by the Lemonheads. I love this song!))  well, I meant to tell you about my mom and how crazy she has been lately and Steven and all that, but I'm sick of typing and I'm going to save it for later.
