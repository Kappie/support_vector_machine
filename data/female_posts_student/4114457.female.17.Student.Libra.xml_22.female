Imagine the trouble i could get myself into outside on a pretty day.... wow, i just realized something, i can still feel brian holding me, i love this! i havent been this happy, hmmm, probably ever.... in fact, he oughta be home and online soon! YAY! so i think i am gonna go wait for him.... night all
