I mean, I DID just pull in a $300 paycheck... so I decided to freshen up my makeup bag... so I'm out to find some new colors for spring/summer AND to replenish my basics... I may even spring for a spiffy new makeup bag and some brushes... :-)  Yeah... looking pretty matters to me... I'm vain, what can I say?  Other than that, everything's going fine... oh... yesterday a certain Steve Gonzales sat next to me and sang me a song while playing guitar... yes... well... while that's interesting and all... it didn't amuse me.     Interesting how now that I'm no longer interested... he seems so much more adamant about making his interests widely known.  Oy... in the meanwhile, I've had my eye out for cuties...  There is this REALLY hot 4th grade teacher at Steubing... I mean... HOT!  :-)  While I would never have a chance with him... just his presence for eye candy is nice.  I think I need a hot summer fling to spice up my life.  Who knows?  Maybe I'll strike something up with Nick if his intentions are to stay with A.S.K.  I'll be at all the training sessions... so if he's still with the company I'll see him a lot.  ;)  Or maybe someone else will catch my eye.  :-P  hehe
