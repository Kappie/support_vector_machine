I'm a happy person Until the other side takes over. Am I a skitzo person?  I am beautiful, I know that My problems aren't like others Teen girls have beauty issues I'm not like this, I'm one of the others.  This is a poem to myself To help me find myself out I need to see who I am So I can let this person out.  Writing is a big part of my life For me it's a relief Let's me express my mood, It's a harmless sort of relief.
