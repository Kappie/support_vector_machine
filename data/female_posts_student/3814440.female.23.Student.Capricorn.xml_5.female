That somehow, it will pick you up and put you back on that raft that's sailing slowly to nowhere. Or wherever it is you think you're going to get to sooner or later. Later rather than sooner.   Perhaps I would have never admitted it. After all, who would want to be perceived as being cocky, arrogant, over-confident. Even the word complacent has such a negative connotation. That smug knowledge that things will always work out in the end. And that life will be happy.   It never crossed my mind that some people died completely and utterly miserable.   Until the day my boat started rocking and I fell overboard.
