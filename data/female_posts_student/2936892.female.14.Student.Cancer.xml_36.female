Was tryin to lk at e time den there was a guy standin in front n he was wearin a watch. so i jus kinda "peep" at it. den both of us started lamin n crappin. its was lyk e 2nd biggest laugh of my life. Maybe i had laugh out all my sadness. rylz, dunno if she's feelin better. doesnt appear so coz i studied wif her again today. hmm, dis time we dint slack as much. so glad. improvement le. Haiz, but i still dun rreally noe ath abt variations. sianz lah, no1 to turn to for help...   goin to help my junior on fri. wonder if i can help coz im a total failure at dnt too. Haiz, jus hope tt every1 pass n get e results they wan. Gd luck once again n jiayou.   * In my prayers too...*
