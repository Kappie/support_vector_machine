Argh.... Today's the first day of hols - 1st june - and things are looking depressing already. Well, but at least i'm gonna go on holiday in malaysia as well as the esplanade library to do research...Heehee...should be nice :) Too bad something...nvm  Anyway, i think i'm gonna enjoy the MEP camp coming up this week...cos that's the only thing i sorta look forward to...or else, i would die of bordem.  Sigh...nothing to write now...oh...1 mth to my violin exam!!! Argh...
