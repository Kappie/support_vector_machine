I really love speaking to him on the phone, I've decided to stop being paranoid and just enjoy this relationship. 'Cause I see it lasting, and I want it too.    Yesterday evening Amy called me to say that all the girls were going up to Joanne's (Lyndsey, Alison and Amy)!So we both went up. It was a really good night, I suprisingly had a lot of fun. Don't think I realised how much I really missed hanging about with them:) Joanne was in Canada for three weeks so she's brought us back pressies, she got me a black paper book, spider pens and shoe laces. The shoe laces are totally awesome, they're black with red stars, I'm gonna wear them with whatever vans, dc's or duffs I choose for next year! During the night this guy called Darren in my year phoned Amy and Alison picked up, she made up this crap about her just finishing with a boyfriend and stuff, whislt I in the background said stuff like "don't tell darren "and "did you tell him that he finished with him for Darren" it was funny cause he totally bought it. When I went home him and his pal Craig called me up asking if what i said was true, i told them it was a wind up. They don't believe me! Oh well the laughs on him! Today works been pretty boring...I was supposed to be meeting Billy and Emma, but i think they'd just think 3's a crowd! So I left it, hope they ain't still there waiting for me....although it would be rather humorous. Listen to how amazing i'm being. Today I was looking at Pauls profile and it said "view my personal website" so i did! It was a face party thing! It said favourite person "Linsey", that's Paul's ex-long term girlfriend, but then I said to myself it's his EX girllfriend, repeating this over to myself a few times made me realise he doesn't have feelings for her, and I was alright when I found on his old profiles "long term relationship" ! :) I'm glad i with him, I'm totally chuffed to bits! He's amazing....ok...maybe i'm a little clingy! I haven't really made plans for tonight, I'll tell you what went down tomorrow! Peace and Empathy Love and Huggles -Rhona xxx
