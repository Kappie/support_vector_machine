Wish me luck! (and a happy birthday)  Well, about this full moon effect. Thursday night there was a full moon, and it has effect like a lot of things. I first saw the moon on the way to band practice. At band this girl kept running around screaming, "It's my birthday! It's my birthday!" And then this NEW director guy, who was NEW, never seen him before, knew everyone's name! It was like creepy. So the moon effected those two people that I noticed. Then I went to Jack's baseball game. On the way there I just stared at the moon. It was so big and bright. When I got there, I sat down next to Mit. All he did was talk. Talk and talk and talk and talk. I think he talked about stuff he wasn't supposed to. But I don't know. It's the moon! The moon makes people go crazy. The next day I went to el lago. We almost reached the highway when I remembered that I left my swimsuit at home, so we went back to get it. Mind you, I don't get effected by the moon. At all. On the ride to the lake, I noticed a big number of dead raccoons. A lot more than normal. I think the moon got to them, and they said, "Hey, let's go get ourselves killed tonight." So they all went into the street and died. They are all lunatics, literally. Luna = moon. So the word means "crazy in the moon". Be warned and watch out for the next full moon.  ~*~To Jack and Mit~*~ Family got on my nerves. I wish you would have come, but if you did I would have gotten in trouble. So either way it was screwed. All I did was lay on my bed and listen to Wicked. And *Mit stop reading* I thought of you, Jack, the whole time and I wondered what you were doing. I wish I could have been with you, but I knew you were having fun, so I wasn't so sad.  Well, that's all I've got for now.  Bye!
