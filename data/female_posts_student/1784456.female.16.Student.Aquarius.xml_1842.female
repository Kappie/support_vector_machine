Am in a bit of trouble. my mum asked me what is happening for the 28th and how many people are coming, and as i cant actually lie to my mum, i had to tell her the truth and say that possibly more than 20 peop,e were coming (if evryone can come that is) and she is not happy. i have been told i have to let a few people down. will give you the revised guest list as soon as i have done but dont worry u will still be on it!
