I think it's the fact that I'm so freakingly high-strung and blitzed on adrenaline all the time, Abby. And being a staid pessimist helps, too. We had to answer questions in relation to their happening in the last six months, or probably happening in the next six months. And I was able to check both boxes for most of them, so double the pointageness. Double my pleasure, double my fun!  I don't feel stressed too much. I still interpretive dance to  Break On Through  by The Doors during Al the Gebra (which was a great book by the way), and do massive cartwheelage during lunch! And I breakdance and freestyle in the mornings, when necessary. So I feel I even out the other stuff, like never doing homework, never studying for les examens, and the like.  And to everyone, even in horrid, horrid places like FRA (SO SO SO sorry, Abby Mac...getting the reinforcements in there soon), interpretive dancing is  the solution  to the dour, life-sucking gloom of the classroom. That rhymed, "gloom" and "...room". Rad. But yesss, I know everytime I "break on thru to the other side" or "come on baby, light my...fiiiiiiiiyuuurrr" I feel psyched up.    A lot of the English stuff is subjective. You have to think like they do or you are killed. Ass-rat SAT BS. It should be shot in the face with a large gun and run over by a herd of cattle.   I got hurt pretty bad a few minutes ago and took some pain killer. Ergo, randomness.
