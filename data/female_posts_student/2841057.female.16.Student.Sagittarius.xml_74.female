But instead of reviewing and solving equations...I just drew some junkies (those junkies look good, I swear..hehe). Anyway... I really need to study... wahh... how can I have the motivation! wahh... math 101a... damn it! What will you do if you need to do something but you're not in the mood of doing it? Gee.. it sucks.
