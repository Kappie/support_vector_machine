Chad is the dad, Jeremy is the 15 year old son, Cheyanne is the little girl, and Brittany is the oldest girl who is 18. They also brought some friends Matt and Mike. Brittany didn't come this time, she's pregnant and staying with her mom. So, since we weren't expecting a bunch of people to arrive, of course the house was a huge mess and we had to clean it up, very quickly. The whole floor got vacuumed and mopped and the kitchen got cleaned and all the bedrooms, and laundry got started, and we even cleaned up lake toys outside. The house went from very dirty to sparkling in half an hour. This, if you know my house, is like a miracle because my house is pretty big. Our friends went to go put there boat in the water and by the time they got back it was clean. Anyway, since all the cleaning is done, Amanda and I are really excited to get tubing! Chad is a really good tubing driver. He is tons of fun and also really careful. Oh yeah, I went to pick up Amanda's friend Sami and I ran into Kyla, she said she missed me and wanted to come over! wow. We hadn't talked in a while and of course I felt the same way. Why didn't I call her? I have no idea, I'm just wierd like that. Anyway, Sarah also want's to come over so it'll be one big party over here at my dad's.
