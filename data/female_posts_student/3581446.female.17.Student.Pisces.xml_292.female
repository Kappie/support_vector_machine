Theo: LOL Theo: Single-finger or touchtype? Me: Wha? Theo: Do you hunt and peck with two fingers or can you touch type? Me: Is touch type the right way? Theo: In theory O:-) Me: Yeah, I do that. Me: If I did the hunt and peck thing, I'd beat my own ass. Theo: LOL Theo: I hunt and peck Me: I'll beat your ass too. Theo: LOL Theo: That sounds like a challenge :-D Me: I AM WOMAN! HEAR ME YARRRRRRRR! Me: YARRRRRR Theo: LOL Theo: ^_*  Seriously, Theo. I'm going to Missouri...and I'll visit some meth labs first and THEN...I'll beat your ass. And you're still gonna take me out for coffee. We'll go back to your place and I'll steal you kimonos. Why? 'Cause I'm mean. =|  ____________  Today (or yesterday, I guess) was really awesome. I woke up at 2:30 pm (how in the hell...). Suriyo left home to sleep over at Aaron's. I think their plan was to buy fireworks. We'll see when they get home.  Maddy called me up a short while later and asked me if she could come over. I said "Sure!" 'cause I love having company over. We watched some Sonic Youth and Blondie videos 'cause I was totally rocking out and being bad ass and shit before she came over.  :lol: I felt like going outside and asked her if she'd like to go to the lake. She agreed as long as we went to El Taco Stand first. We did. We got to the lake and we took some pics. Really awesome ones. She looked bomb, as always. I...no. Just no. I was a mess. My hair? Sticking out in all directions. Okay, okay, I looked like a cute kid. :aww: [Gotta hug and comfort the ego once in a while.]  We got home, edited her pics, and then we walked to the 39 bus stop. I had a weird feeling...'cause the 39 doesn't run late at night during the weekend, but she checked the schedule, and she said it did. We smoked some cigs on some person's steps (sorry, kind neighbour). Oh wait! Before that, we saw Tim and he shouted out of his car "No smoking!" CUTE! but no. Some other kid we knew from elementary school walks by with his friends and he tells me to stop smoking. !!!!! Where's the love? Really... So, we're like waiting for the bus, and I'm still feeling skeptical and I check the bus schedule. She read it wrong. She read the morning schedule. It was 9:30 and the last bus came by at around 6! I was too into my cig to be angry at her. No biggie. I was totally chillin' and she was too. We walked down the street to the 7 bus stop. During the long wait, we had an intelligent conversation...something I never get to do. :(  Man, I was so deep and she understood what I was saying. Social issues get me going like a mofo. We always talk about that kind of stuff and that's one of the reasons I love hanging out with her. I seldom have serious conversations with any of my best friends and this is really nice for a change. I hope I can do it with all of my friends...someday. I don't think I want to talk about it on here 'cause it's about race (black people! eek! white people! eek!) and y'all probably don't know what I'm gonna say anyway and I don't have the will power to argue with you internet folks.  Aw, what?! It's four already?! Hey, I didn't even wash my face yet. I've had this make-up on for 12 hours. I'm gonna break out. NOOOOOO!!!! I will use all the wonderful beauty products I can find in my room. Muahaha.  And that's how Toureille escaped her certain fate.  Wha...I don't know what I'm saying. I'm just like...writing everything that's going on in my head. I'm actually like half way asleep. And I keep saying "and" and "like" like way too much. I don't know if that made sense.  And I'm feeling like I'm high off my ass.  I love love.  Even though I lost some love recently, I still love love.  That's good.  *sniff*  *tear*  Okay, I want my bed now. ZzzzZzzz...
