Kind of sad... ...Except Andrew, he said that since he lives close by he'll be at Jefferson at least twice a week. heh, goof... ...And I'm sure some of the people going to Shepherd might stop in once or twice to say hi to their old teachers...   Bah..  For our exam in Theatre3 we're doing scenes. I'm in a group with 4 other girls. Kind of hard to find a scene with parts for five girls and only five girls.. But we're doing the scene from Grease where Sandy and the Pink Ladies are in the bedroom drinking and trying to pierce Sandy's ears. I'm Jan... Brittany said I should be her because my personality fit the part.. or something.. Meh, I'm not complaining... It works for me... But the exam is Tuesday, so I have five days to learn the scene... Bah...   I wish G had us do monologues like he did for our first semester exam. I can learn those pretty quick--for first semester exam, I learned a page and a half monologue (it only had to be one minute, and mine went over that) in one night. :) And, I came across a really good monologue while searching for a scene. ...All I can remember about it is that the woman in it was a little eccentric -- but she still was all there -- and jumped quickly from topic to topic... I think I could pull that one off quite well.. :P  I lost my copy of  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn . That pissed me off... I don't really remember when I lost it, but I think I left it on top of the locker above mine -- I always put my book and bottle of water (whatever I am carrying) there while I get out my books -- between second and third periods, and I guess I forgot to get it... But I think I remember carrying to it third period -- I slept through nearly the entire class period... So, I dunno... I checked in lost and found, and it wasn't there... I'll check again tomorrow, and, if it's not there, then I am going to buy another copy... I only had 40 pages left to read and wanted to finish it today or tomorrow... But I guess I'll have to find another book to read during classes (the only time I read anymore) tomorrow... This really pisses me off... :/
