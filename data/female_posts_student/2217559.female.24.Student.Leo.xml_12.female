I wanted to turn around about hundred times before I hit 71. I miss her so much already. We must have talked on the phone 5 times yesterday.  I woke up this morning at my house in Houston and I just felt like a complete freak. I can't believe I am just days away from leaving everything I know. Leaving Austin wa sby far the hardest moment for me. I kept having to say goodbye to all of my friends, one last lunch appointment, one last dinner, one last phone call. I never thought I would ever be so tired of saying goodbye in my life. And the thing that gets me is that everyone that is in my life are in my life for a reason and I will always cherish that. I am not saying "goodbye" forever, just for a little while.   I am heading to my grandparents farm today. 400 acres of land - the air is so fresh and so clean.  (Isn't that a song?  So fresh and so clean..) I can't wait to see my Nana and Papa.  Tonight is our Thanksgiving dinner. I think I will leave Houston around 10 this morning so I can have a full day with them.   Hmm, so yesterday when I was leaving Austin I was driving down Congress headed towards Ben White. All i could see was the capital in my rearview mirror. What an interesing view it was. I remember when I first got to Austin and the way I felt when I first saw that tall building. It was a feeling of a new beginning for me. I kept thinking of all the different things I have experienced, all the people I have met over the years and it was just a very weird feeling to have leaving. I am excited about my future for the first time in a LONG time. No more secretary-go-get-me-this work. Thank God! I can't wait for my new venture. This is going to be awesome.   So, Paddy...I miss you!  And my Lisa, AJ, Charity, Jackie, Dannielle, Christina, Kevin, Starnes!, Tammy, Deborah - Joe? Okay, not him. I miss everyone!! I can't wait to send postcards to all of you!  Long live the Ex-ECI Association!
