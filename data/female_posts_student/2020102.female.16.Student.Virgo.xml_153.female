Lewis quotes:  "Atheism turns out to be too simple. If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning..." --Mere Christianity  "All men alike stand condemned, not by alien codes of ethics, but by their own, and all men therefore are conscious of guilt." --The Problem of Pain  "Of all bad men religious bad men are the worst." --Reflections on the Psalms  "You cannot study Pleasure in the moment of the nuptial embrace, nor repentance while repenting, nor analyze the nature of humour while roaring with laughter." --Myth Became Fact,  World Dominion   "History is a story written by the finger of God." --Christian Reflections  "If there is equality it is in His love, not in us." --Transposition and Other Addresses  "Many things--such as loving, going to sleep, or behaving unaffectedly--are done worst when we try hardest to do them." --Studies in Medieval and Renaissance Literature  "The universe rings true wherever you fairly test it." --Surprised by Joy  "The notion that everyone would like Christianity to be true, and therefore all atheists are brave men who have accepted the defeat of all their deepest desires, is simply impudent nonsense."  --Encounter With Light   "Now that I am a Christian I do not have moods in which the whole thing looks very improbable: but when I was an atheist I had moods in which Christianity looked terribly probable." --Mere Christianity   "Looking for God--or Heaven--by exploring space is like reading or seeing all Shakespeare's plays in the hope that you will find Shakespeare as one of the characters..." --'The Seeing Eye',  Christian Reflections    "Books on psychology or economics or politics are as continuously metaphorical as books of poetry or devotion." --Miracles  "We may ignore, but we can nowhere evade, the presence of God." --Letters to Malcolm  "Mercy, detached from Justice, grows unmerciful." --The Humanitarian Theory of Punishment  "'Yes,' said Queen Lucy. 'In our world too, a Stable once had something inside it that was bigger than our whole world.'" --The Last Battle    "'Safe?' said Mr. Beaver...'Who said anything about safe? 'Course he isn't safe. but he's good. He's the King, I tell you.'" --The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe    "A creature revolting against a creator is revolting against the source of his own powers--including even his power to revolt...It is like the scent of a flower trying to destroy the flower." --A Preface to Paradise Lost  "Really, a young Atheist cannot guard his faith too carefully. Dangers lie in wait for him on every side." --Surprised by Joy  "And then she understood the devilish cunning of the enemies' plan. By mixing a little truth with it they had made their lie far stronger." --The Last Battle  "From the moment a creature becomes aware of God as God and of itself as self, the terrible alternative of choosing God or self for the centre is opened to it." --The Problem of Pain  "Prostitutes are in no danger of finding their present life so satisfactory that they cannot turn to God: the proud, the avaricious, the self-righteous, are in that danger." --The Problem of Pain
