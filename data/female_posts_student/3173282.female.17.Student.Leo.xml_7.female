Hehe sorry Dass but eh u know ur one of them:      to my TRUE friends:   i got ur back, i'll be there.   call me when u need me, don't hesitate to tell me.   i'll listen, i'll lie, i'll cry, i'll laugh, i'll chill, i'll drive, i'll walk, i'll run, i'll hide, i'll pay, i'll stay, i'll leave, and i'll believe.  wherever, for whatever, however, till whenever...well actually forever.
