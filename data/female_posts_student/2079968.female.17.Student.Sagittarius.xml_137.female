But anywho...yeah...I wanna do something creative...write or take photos or...i'm not sure.  I'm just so incredibly restless. I have this energy inside me and I need to do something productive with it.  And everytime I try, whether it's taking photos, trying to play the guitar, or write, I just can't sit still.  I had the most fun ever making Ryan's present with Laura and Rose.  We made the "I *heart* Ryan" tees w/ the pic of his face...his expression was priceless.  I love doing stuff like that.  Why don't I more often? Not doing creepy stalkerly things like make fanclub shirts for my friends, but just...making t-shirts and designing stuff. Hmm...
