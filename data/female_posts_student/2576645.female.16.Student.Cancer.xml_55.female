It shall be fun, what with all my inquirys on wether or not my grandparents watched the DemocraticNational Convention last night. My guess is  no . Is it just me, or do all old people seem to beRepublicans?Does some  morbid  transformation ortrans-continental  brain washing  occurto make this so? Is this an example oftheir acquired wisdom, orof them slowly growing  senile ?     But since I am young,do not require the assistance of a hearing aid or fiber tablets, I watched the convention last night. Imust say,  Clinton  is one of the  best  speakers I have ever heard.I never really watched him speak, since when he was in office, I was in elementary and was a little to busy following the Spice Girls instead of national politics. Kerry may be a bore, but Edwards can make up the charisma for the both of them. Also, has anyone ever watched that 'CBN' news network on Fox Family thats on really late at night? Its  disgusting . Its like a cross between republican propaganda and the religion channel. Last night, they were discussing "why-do-democrats-hate-bush-so-much". Well, Mister 'I-am-posing-as-a-reliable-news-reporter-but-I-am-actaully-a-christian-republican-gooney', I am no expert, but maybe its because of the downfall in the economy, healthcare, education, and most importantly (and most glarily) the serious situationsin international relations. Mmm.. yah. That  might  be it. And for the record, I do not  hate  Bush. He might even be a nice person (though that subject could be fiercely debated.) But as a president, Bush kinda sucks.        Kinda ?      Katherine, who are you trying to kid?       He  really  sucks.
