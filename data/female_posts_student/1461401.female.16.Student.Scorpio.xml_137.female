And not just that, but to get stomped on by every single team. That, my friend, is why we love our team so much. Our team is our only claim to fame! Who cares about our other sports, or our wonderful arts department, we have the worst football team, and that's all we need.  So go right on losing you crazy bobcats, and we'll be behind you all the way!  even if it's only because we'd like to keep our distance...
