And, Toshi suggested that we should go to the first floor, maybe lemo is in first floor. We went there, and didn't see her. We start to yelling her name, then we heard her yelling sound. But, where is her??? We kept look for her for long long time and room by room, but still she was no where to find. Then, the guy who live in the first floor said maybe she is in basement. I went to basement while yelling her name. Lemo's yelling sound became louder and louder. Finally!!!!! We found her in the basement. Can you believe it? She stayed in the basement without food and water for seven days!!!!! She looks lose the weight and hungry. We gave her food and she just couldn't stop eating. Poor Lemo!!!!! Toshi and I are so happy to find her, and she looks fine. Thank GOD for that.   Lemo!!! Don't leave again!!!
