(Sorry I didn't tell you just now Jaci, but I forgot to mention it). Anyway, I guess it's okay. UD is a private school and insanely expensive and it's also very cold in Colo. Well, I know I still have 4 more schools to hear back from, but I may just be hanging around Oklahoma for a little while longer if no one wants me.   NO ONE WAAAAAAANTS ME!  tear.
