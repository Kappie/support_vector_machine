And I too am sucked in to the glitz and glamour of it all. They're getting ready to report the best supporting actor, a category I haven't really cared about/followed-Benecio Del Toro is scary looking! YIKES! And the winner is....wating...la la la...stilll waiting...the Oscar goes to Tim Robbins.  Greeaaat.  It's his first nomination for a performance, and his first win.  I didn't see Mystic River, hear it is very good, and he's supposed to be a great actor, he's currently giving the usual speech, thanking everyone in existence and giving props to his fellow actors/nominees.  Thank God he didn't pull the usual Hollywood stunt, and try and push his political views on all of us. We already know that he's one of the most liberal people in existence, and frankly we don't care-he's not there to tout his political views.  Anyhoo-as for the other nominees-I hope to see Charlize Theron win in the Best Actress category (anyone who would destroy their looks for a role as she did for Monster is deserving, in my opinion), Johnny Depp in Best Actor (although he won't-he was AMAZING-I don't care if it was a comedic role, and it has nothing to do w/ hottness), and Renee' Zelleweger for Best Supporting Actress-she was amazing in the last two movies she was nominated for, and this year I hope she finally wins.  LOTR needs to pick up best picture.  As for the others...I haven't paid much attention.  Fave dresses so far: Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee', Angelina Jolie, and Diane Lane.  More later...back to watching right now.    P.S. Sean Connery. Still awesome after all these years.
