I take people's word seriously, because words are no joke.  You know the saying, sticks and stones break bones. Words can shatter the soul.  I gave someone my word, and I broke it a couple of days ago. So to make ammends, I apologize, because I am truly sorry, and I hope it would be enough... And again I gave my word.  I wish I hadn't. It's hard when you take people seriously. Harder when you take yourself seriously.  I guess i take myself toooo seriously. I wish I can break my word. I wish i go behind people's back and stab them. I really do.  But Trust is something that I hold close. I will never ever voluntarily break my word.   Take my word for it.
