Well, today, was overall not a bad day besides that. My back hurts really bad though. Well, 3rd period study hall was the best one I've ever had. I heart hearing stories from Molly.  So if you can't tell, I'm feeling a little bit of animosity towards people in general right now. I wouldn't be a good time to mess with me right now because, and this is a promise, you will go down just like the others. Don't get on my bad side. I'm a bitch when you push me to be.  But really, I'm a nice person to the people I love. lol  Well, right now I'm talking to Dan and Danielle and listening to CKY and I'm eating dinner.
