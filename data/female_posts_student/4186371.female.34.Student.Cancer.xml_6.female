Apparently, cupcakes are the new rage, fad, it thing being seen at everything from an office party to a wedding.  The picture of a Boston Creme cupcake on the cover looked delicious!  The article talks about how these cupcake bakeries are opening up and offering such delights as vanilla cupcakes with real butter frosting and a sugar flower on top, or maybe a gold leaf.  Sprinkles are too common for these gourmet treats.  One place even offers it's customers a chance to decorate their own cupcakes.  Sounds like a lot of work to me and if I wanted to decorate my own cupcake, I'd start by baking my own cupcake.  But the funniest part of all about this story was when they mentioned trying something different.  Instead of making carrot cake cupcakes (say that 10 times fast) they offer such delectable suggestions as beets, parsnips, or celery roots.  GROSS!!  How'd  you like to offer a beet cupcake to a guest?  How many cupcakes do  you  think would be left over??  LOL  I hope you like beets.  I went to Target today to kind of give my pet sitting client time to leave the house because when I got there at the appointed time, he was still there and didn't plan on leaving for another hour and I really didn't feel like sitting around for an hour with nothing to do.  I went looking for jewelry to go with my new outfit, didn't find anything which is fine because I wasn't really in the mood to buy.  And I looked at their cds.  Can you believe they didn't have one cd, or even a tag showing they once had it, of Vertical Horizon, Evan  Jaron, or Moulin Rouge?  I walked out of there in disbelief.  What is this world coming to?
