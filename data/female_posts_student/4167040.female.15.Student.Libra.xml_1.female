I'm going to the lock-in at my school today from 4:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m. so that should be fun, I hope...lol. I need to go in a min. and finish getting ready for that, I'm just waiting for my hair to dry so I can straighten it.       Yep...Well, I guess I have no more to say...although I wish I did. Hm...I'm listening to "The Girl All The Bad Guys Want" *Good song!* Yep...well that's it, lol. Goodbye for now!
