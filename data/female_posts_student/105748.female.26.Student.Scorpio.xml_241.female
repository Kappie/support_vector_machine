You're gonna hate me for telling you this, but I did send two of my photos to another internet chum, and I even sent a videotape of myself to another internet chum. Yeah, yeah, I know. I've known you longer than those two, and you deserve seniority priveleges. But I sent you my favorite books and xeroxed pages from my diary, that should count for something, dammit! Oh, I'm tendrilling (a word I stole from Susan Swan's novel,  The Wives of Bath , it means rambling). I like the book list segment. You trust my judgment that much to give it its own section? ;)     BTW, Ching, read the latest two entries of my last adventure in the City at OD.    Vince, I'm sorry for the belated response to your offline Yahoo Messenger message. I hardly use YM. I tend to use AIM as Gleetv222. You can put me on your Buddy List for both YM and AIM.     April, I didn't know you are in TX. Jay, remind me where you are located. Vince, you're in the East Coast, right? Was it NY? Pia is in CA last that I remember.
