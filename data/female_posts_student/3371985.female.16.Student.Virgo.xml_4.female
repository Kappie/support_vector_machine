Besides i know some of you out there at  urlLink Friendster™  stares at my pictures! And i know some of you even print them! Haayy.. Obssesed people..oi nakakatakot yan noh! Parang stalker! *waaahhh* Anyways forget about my "kakapalan ng mukha" i was supposed to write something sensible here.  Ah..yes.. The other day i was goin home i rode a jeepney who's driver i suppose is 46+ years old,and i couldn't stop feeling sorry for him coz im the only passenger..ang hirap mag"hakot" ng pasahero noh. And i can see that he's really tired. That's when i began to think about "salary/wage" (whatever is the difference..i know there'e a difference coz it was discussed in Eco class..but i just forgot..).    WHY IS IT THAT THOSE WHO WORK SO HARD GET PAID SO LOW, WHILE THOSE WHO JUST SIT AROUND IN THE OFFICE AND BOSS OTHER PEOPLE AROUND GET'S MUCH MUCH MUCH MORE?!?    Why is this world so unfair? i know i dream of being rich and bossing people 'roud and all that..but still why is this world so unfair?  Haayy...this sucks..im out..comments are so much welcomed..
