Something like Seoul Garden .. But cheaper lahz .. Of course .. lolx .. kinda funny to see someone wearing formal there ... No offence worx, just stating the facts... OH .. My best cousin wasn't there due to some family problems ... But still enjoy the food as I was pretty hungry ...   After that went to Giant Hypermarket ... Bought anything ? Nope, not mi but my mother ... Kinda sianz, after that went home lohz, wad else ... Erm then started streaming... First time that it reached the peak of 8 person ... Royston message mi in MSN, seem to have something urgent, but I cannot find him after ... So I went to called Peiyu asking wad is happening... Then she told mi but I wasn't too clear about that ... So keep on message Royston in MSN ...   After that he came back and told us everything ... There were Eugene, Peiyu, Mi, Royston ... Kinda vexed after hearing that .. Dun wanna say much about that thing... Keep on streaming ... Then awhile later Adrian joined in our conversation and was being label as the yellow colour one .. lolx ... cause he was wearing yellow colour shirt last time .. My streaming got problems as too much ppl ... My connection are lousy I know ... Then it cannot take in anymore ppl ... Eugene and Royston cannot joined in ... And so Royston say he gonna stream at S.H.E Faith Radio Station .. Fooling around with him and ask him to let mi be the Dj .. lolx ...  but the radio station was down so he was unable to stream ... I stop mine not long after ... Kinda tired and went off to sleep at about 1 plus ...  [.J.u.S.t.P.a.S.s.I.n.'.B.y.]Signed off at SGT-0122 Hrs
