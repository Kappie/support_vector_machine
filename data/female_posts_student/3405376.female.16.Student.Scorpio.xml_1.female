For once KT didn't have a good weekend which kinda suprised me. even mine was more exciting. Kim and KT were both at skool today but there was no confrontation. Danm it. Oh well. Attempted to find out about kims saturday night. maybe tomorrowe. I finished leahs pom pom which is a lot bigger than planned but still awesome. I should probably be doing Homework right now so i better go. Dee
