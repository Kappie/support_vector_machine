He as was a total asshole, but eventually I made him understand that I couldn't afford the $100 in overdraft fees for THEIR mistake. So he credited my account (my Aaron's account, not my bank account) with $100. Of course, although that means I haven't got to make but a $16 payment next month, it does me absolutely no good now. My account is overdrawn by $142 and it will take most if not all of my paycheck on Thursday to put me back into the black. Which will leave me with nothing to live on for the next two weeks. Then I called about my meal ticket with the school only to discover that the voucher that Beth sent from Voc Rehab is $32 short, and then found out that Traffic hasn't even received any paperwork yet. AND Beth was not in the office today, so I couldn't get anything done about it. However, the Bookstore did have my paperwork and I was able to get my books for next semester, plus some basic supplies for both me and Michael. Pens, paper, pencils, etc. And I still have plenty of credit left to go back and get whatever I or Michael might still need. I tried to set up the new bed frame I bought, about killing myself in the effort, only to find out that the damn thing is too small for the full size mattress. So I had to get it back apart and set the old one back up. But I left the headboard where it belongs. I also discoverd that the thing has a horrible musty smell to it. I cleaned it as well as I could with some wood polish/cleaner. We'll see how it is tonight. Now I am at work. Been here 55 mintues and taken one call. FUN!! The guys leave at 9:00 and I am here alone from then until 12:00. Long and boring. My web site is looking pretty good, I think. I still have my "Kathy and the Unicorn" story and "Choices" story to put in, and an "about me" page. But I haven't got those stories ready yet. I might work on one of them tonight. Then again, I might not.
