They're still not known (hence the name I guess (I wonder if they'd change it if they got big (hmmm))) But they're still pretty good.  Oh yeah the polls more for people that know me at the moment, but if you want you can still answer it. you can pretend you know me :) Finally... We had our first water polo tournament today. we played man down for half a game since we on ly hace 6 people there from our team. (whoever flaked im gonna find and umm well i dunno but im gonna.. oh *sigh* GRRR.) but yeah im mad at whoever didn't show up. we lot all 3 of the games wich is kinda no suprise since most us our team has only had like 4 practices and we're all out of shape. oh well still have the rest of the summer. -drea
