Anyway, read and enjoy, and if you don't, don't complain.  In all honesty, when I looked at the catalogue, I was apalled.  This is being merketed toward my little sister.    Abercrombie  Fitch to your kids: Group sex now!  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted: November 14, 2003 1:00 a.m. Eastern   © 2003 WorldNetDaily.com    Forty-five specific portrayals of sexual imagery in the first 120 pages, advice to the readers ... this is how the new Abercrombie  Fitch Quarterly titled "The Christmas Field Guide" begins its new quarterly magazine that is targeted to your 10- to 13-year-olds. The 45 images include overt portrayals of group sex, lots of teen and young adult nudity, men kissing, and teens /young adults frolicking in a river engaging in sexual activity in multiple group settings.   Did I mention that the actual clothing doesn't begin being advertised until page 120?   Abercrombie  Fitch are not new to this game and they are taking a huge bet this Christmas season. The wager is ... you won't care enough to do anything about it.   For the last four years a handful of concerned parents and citizens have been waging a miniature war on the popular teen clothier. Each year, the clothier has made hollow gestures at trying to "reform its act." But these attempts are not only insincere, they are laughable. Laughable – but they are not funny.   Each year, thousands of children across America beg their parents to get them the latest t-shirt, jeans, jacket or underwear from "A" (Yes they even market a line of thongs for 8- to 10-year-old girls made to stick up out of the "low cut" jeans they also sell.) Many of these parents, completely unaware of how "A" goes about marketing, plunk down thousands of dollars around the holidays ... and Abercrombie  Fitch continues to profit.   This year will be different. Thousands of consumers are being put on alert as to the marketing methods of the clothier, web-log writers are going to be commenting on it, church and para-church groups are organizing protests, and this year we will even advise investors via direct links to popular business Internet sites like CBS Marketwatch as to the marketing methods the company is willing to use.   After all, they do say, "We don't just sell clothes, we promote a lifestyle!" And what kind of "lifestyle"?   Well, in this year's issue in the "sexpertise" column on page 279, a lady presumably qualified to be referred to as a "sexpert" states that kids going to college this year, "shouldn't be looking for someone to marry." Nope, when it comes to sex, kids should be "focused on getting experience." The "sexpert" is also asked about and gives advice concerning the issue of doing "sex for three." She also advises readers to be willing to "go down" on a date at the movies, "just so long as you do not disturb those around you." And, of course, what kind of column would a "sexpertise" column be if it did not address the issue of self-stimulation.   There is also a comparison column for the hormonally driven young men in the "A" readership comparing the "fruits" of biting into "fresh apple right off the tree" vs. the "store-bought variety that sit on the shelf wrinkled and bruised from the handling." This column is not comparing fruit at all but the benefits of teenage men sleeping with perky school girls vs. "sexy" older women, even married ones.   So the plan of action?   This year's is multi-fold:     Read this column and forward it to everyone you know.   Dial the National Coalition for the Protection of Children and Families (toll free) 888-877-7723.   Add your voice to the growing list of parents, teens and citizens who wish to see sexually transmitted disease rates reduced, and less teen pregnancy by signing the letter of protest at Stop A   And by all means spend no money with Abercrombie  Fitch this year. (American Eagle, H and a variety of other clothiers provide clothing that is equally fashionable to the style of Abercrombie  Fitch – but without the unnecessary nudity and sexualization of Americans aged 10 to 18.)   In a day in which more parents than ever are concerned about the likelihood of their daughter getting pregnant, their child being sexually active long before they are mature enough to handle the consequences or the rampant spread of sexually transmitted diseases in the "younger than 20" demographic today – it's time to stop Abercrombie  Fitch.   Abercrombie  Fitch is wagering you won't care about what they do, so they've rolled the dice. For me, my money is on the decency of you and the hope you have for the future of your kids.   So ... I'll take that bet!
