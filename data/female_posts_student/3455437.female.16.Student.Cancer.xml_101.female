I have too much homework. Every day is the same. School sucks. I don't have time to draw.  I don't have time to work on my site or forum. I am always tired. My eye's hurt. Preliminarys are soon.  I want to run away and live in Thailand or Japan.   On a lighter note, if I need to get glasses in the next couple of year, I wanna get purple contacts. >.
