So I go to buy some jeans, try them on and they fit great. not perfect, i've never had a perfit fit jean. well they had this little snag on them, so i go back to the rack where they are folded and get another pair. same size, cut etc.  yeah so now i come home and they suck! the waist is waaay high, and i have no waist so this is a problem. and they're petite. wtf! aaghh, i should just quit and wear umpa-lumpa style clothes. oh and i cant return them no more, i took all the tags off. so ill see if they shrink in the wash a little (yeah like its possible to shrink up-down and not side-to-side) lol
