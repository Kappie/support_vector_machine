No idea frm where to begin... the hols have made me an unmarried housewife   Life revolves around the broom, vacuum, washing machine, detergents and hanging out washed clothes. sic still manage to find time to read the straits times. prevents my brain cells frm degenerating. then there's azu juz a call away. i have combed city hall with her atleast 8times juz laz freakish week alone! we never fail to talk abt the city hall dude everytime we meet. he's called Dude, smtimes wateva-an.
