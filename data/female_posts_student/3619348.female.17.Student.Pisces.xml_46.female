Said beaders always gripe/bitch/complain/second guess me no matter what I am doing, you would think they were the ones teaching the freaking bead class. Good cripe. So I have decided to instate some classes that will give me a break from these infernal people every once in a while. Along with our ‘public’ classes, we are going to hold the ‘Elite bead core’ parties. These classes will be held at our home (In the living room most likely, yay and fun!) and will be most exclusive. Basically that means, only the people I want to come will be invited. Mother has given me complete control over said parties, and I intend to enjoy this power.  Yay for being a brat and picking favorites.
