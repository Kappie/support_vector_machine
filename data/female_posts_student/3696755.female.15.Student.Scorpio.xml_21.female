Im super beeming happy, I care about someone who cares about me and things are good. I realized things kinda repeat themselves. Like lets use my situationas an example:Ok i was upset with things, with myself, and the fact that i didnt have someone. So i quit trying, just gave everything up and all the sudden things start fallin in my lap. Like i got some new friends, i starting passing math, and Chris came along. And i liked him a lot ya ya ya you no the story. So we go out everything is super duper and then things start to be bad, we break up and its over. Im upset with things again, with myself again, and also im back with no one. So im all bumbed for a while and then about a week ago things made a complete 180.Things are goin good, Im happy with myself, and also ive found someone who i care about. #3 (hes really #1 and only now but i dont wanna confuse yall with a # change)and I have been talkin on the phone every night since our little thing. Hes been outta town with his best friend but still calls and stuff and texts me about how much he misses me and stuff like that. I really like him a lot and i think he feels the same way. I cant wait till he gets home, hell be back this weekend. Anyway, this entry wasnt suposta be about how much i care but him, it was suposta be about how no matter how bad things get, they will always get better. Always. So for all you people ( i like to think a lot of people read this) who are kinda down remember - " everythingmoves in circles."
