It's a bitch living by mass transit and away from my friends and school and work but I love my condo so it makes up for the rest.  2) Do I have friends?:  Yes I have a few, not many, but there is Tyla who reminds me of a younger Toni and there is Mike who cracks me up, plus I love hearing his girl problems.  Mike is good with the one liners.  Then there is all the people I am meeting through them as well as Erika who I work with.  I think I am going out with her this week for the first time.  She's gonna show me around.  Truth is I have a lot of school friends who I talk to in classes and hang with in between but don't ever see outside of the school setting.  3) Am I cold?: Not so much anymore.  4) How is school?:  Fine.  Some classes I am bored in and some fascinate me.  Needless to say that midterms are coming up and that will pretty much be the first indicator of how I am doing.  I have a quarterly exam in my ear training class on Friday which I need to study for.  Maybe I'll also go use a practice room for the hour before....  But I love everything I can put my hands into at this school.  I forgot about all the resources.  It's amazing what I have access to and the things that I do in class.  Got my first gig this past week.  5) How were the grammy's?:  Fantastic, miss the warm weather the most.  6) When am I coming home?:  March 15 - March 21 will be the first time I am home  7) My question for you!:  When are you coming to visit????  :)
