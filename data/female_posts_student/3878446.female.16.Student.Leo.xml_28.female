It was funny, it had action, it was sad, Michelle if you were there with us you would have been crying! It's a great movie, definently one I'll buy. Lots of twists, I thought I had it all figured out but I was completely wrong. But one thing about the movie...it's going along telling the story, building up to the climax, and then all of a sudden you're there, it almost seems like there should have been another 5-6 minutes of anticipation before everything started happening. But that is just my opinion. All in all, great movie, Will Smith was hott in it, as in all his movies, I enjoyed it.     Sunday I'm going to go see The Village. I'm excited fot it. My brother is freakin out, he's afraid haha! He's turning 21 and he's terrified to go see this movie! I'm afraid too, but it's more of an exciting scared, but that's because I love scaring myself. A couple of friends of ours are going with us, one who's not really afraid of anything, and then his girlfirend who is already on the verge of tears. I love seeing 'scary' movies with people who are completely terrified, it gives more of a...dramatic effect to the movie.     Oh I also saw Hellboy tonight...DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. Unbelievably boring. Anyways, I'm tired and would like to get some sleep. I'm getting up early tomorrow to catch Man. United play AC Milan!! The game starts at 10. okay okay so it's not early, but what do you expect from a teen who is on summer vacation and sleeps all day??
