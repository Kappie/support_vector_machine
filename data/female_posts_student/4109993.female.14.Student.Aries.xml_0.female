I just can't stand this pain, Anymore I've got to get away...    Silent screams   Realistic dreams   Dry Tears   Forgetful fears... And you.    Seated in silence, Staring at the knife... It's blade so silver and shiny It carves scars so deep in my flesh Releasing my deep crimson blood I let it drip... When will I awake from this nightmare? This nightmare they call my life...    Silent screams   Realistic dreams   Dry Tears   Forgetful fears... And you.    You've treated me in such a way that, (You've lead me to my grave) You've haunted me, screamed at me (You've lead me to my grave) You've hurt me, you're killing me... (You've lead me to my grave)    Silent screams   Realistic dreams   Dry Tears   Forgetful fears... So many fears... And you.
