I thought today would never end. But it didn't really feel like the last day. It was kind've weird. But I was sad at the end of the day because Joe is going to a different school next year. *sniff*sniff* I gave him a hug though, I was really sad and I told him I'd miss him. That would suck so bad, going to a different school your senior year. I feel bad for him. Hopefully we stay in touch.   Today we only have 2nd, 4th, and 6th periods, so we had and hour and a half at the end of the day for make up exams, so my friends and I left early and we went to a state park nearby. It was: Me, Randi, Holly, Rachel, Carley, Celsey, Renee, and....Andy. lol Andy, the only guy. So we had a picnic. It was so fun because us girls were so hyper and giddy and we were laughing so much, especially Celsey and I. It was hilarious. Then Carley, Celsey, and Renee had to leave for church softball. So the rest of us went on a hike on the trails there. It was really fun. We hiked all the way to this small waterfall spot. So Randi, Rachel, and I stayed by them because we were gonna wait until Holly and Andy came back down because they wanted to climb all the way up. So Rach and I decided to run through the waterfalls. It was so much fun..and so refreshing. Holly did it too when she came back. It was so fun. We were soaked, but it was fun. Then we hiked back, and left.  Now, I have to go do my hair really quick because I have spanish senior night to go to at Casa Fiesta. I have to do my hair really quick too!! YIKES!  TOMORROW I SEE HARRY POTTER!! WOOOOOOOooo...Laterz!
