See, if I'm in a bad mood and I drink caffeine, then it's that much worse, or better with opposite circumstances. And being not in the best mood after the wonderful English bomb...yeah.  I am the King Poster...none come before me! Dude. This is going to be really f-ing hard. Blah.  I'm glad you're feeling better! It's time to finish the stupid paper and get ready not to type anymore.  Piss on school, dudes and dudettes, the end is near.
