And although yesterday nothing hurt where it was supposed to, today, everything hurt where it was supposed to. Dammit! The doctor sent me home with more information, instructions for rest and fluids, and a few bags of medications.. no joke.. I have these cute little bags of it.. WOW. Its a lot of ibuprofen, cepacol, and codeine. Wow.. codeine?? i'm a little nervous about taking that. But then again, the pain at night is really sucky... hmm.. I'll consider it. Anyway, so I have mono. i'm glad to know what I have, but i'm a little pissed off that I wont be getting better soon. It also feels weird to talk to people about it. There seems to be that stigma that I must have kissed some big bad virus...and EVERYone wants to know if Dan "has it yet." I honestly don't have a clue where I got mono. It could be through a number of close friends or relatives who I share food with or spend time around (a sneeze, a cough, anything can have it if theres body fluids in it), or even through the dental school, which is one of my guesses, but unlikely...my cousin Sajid is the only person in the past few months that I have heard of with mono. My family went to go see him a little before he came down with it, but I didn't go with them. Of course, then I saw my family afterwards, so thats the best possibility. I still can't believe i actually have mono. I guess its better now than later. I'm worried about my classes and medschool applications. So much to do and so little energy! I am having trouble getting to know this new "sick self." I'm not used to not bustling about going places, talking to people all over... It exhausts me to walk down a single flight of stairs now! What happened?? Dan brought over some popsicles the other day. They are fabulous. Its the only thing that numbs my throat enough to sleep. Also, I've been watching more TV lately than I have in the past 5 years altogether. I feel like such a bum! by the way, theres this great flashy gay guy with an interior decorating/cooking show. The Chris Lowell Show I think. he's kinda fun to watch. Ok, I don't feel like a bum. I feel like a homebody.. sitting at home..all day long... on her bum.
