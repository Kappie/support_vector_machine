I'm really happy that it's over now time for the real world, well semi- real world. Where I make all my decisions what to do? I'll be an adult with responsibilites, it's weird but at the same time relievinng.It a wonderful feeling but at the same time it's sad because everything goes so fast. When you're younger you look forward to high school when it's over then you look forward to college after college some go right into the real world for others it's off the grad school or medical school after or during you get married and have a family and some where in between there I'll grow up. Right now just isn't that time. It's just so crazy how things fly by so fast and you don't even realize it. I'll probably cry I know that my mom probably is. I love her to death she's a wonderful woman but very controlling at times. I know her and my father are proud of me. I took a lot of pictures none of my by myself really. It's just weird how I was sitting in my class it felt like just yesterday that I started high school amazing I've waited for this day for what it feels like centuries. I spent time with my Other Half today his name is Evan, when he came and got me I just looked at him and smiled, amazing how much you can love one person and the feeling you get when you're with them. I still get the butterflies the tingles all of that good stuff, eight months and I get the same feelings but now it's ten times stronger. I never imagined someone making me feel this good. Don't get me wrong we've have our fair share of bad, but the good comes out on top. He's wonderful I wish there were words to describe how I felt about him there are but I'm just not that great with writing about things such as love my friend La'teasha is great at that and so is Evan he's a wonderful writer. The other night he told me that bowling was his thing the one thing that he was good at and I'm thinking that's not the only thing you're good at you're good at loving me and putting your everything into us, all the free time you have that is. See me and my boyfriend come from two different worlds, it's hard to compromise my world to fit around his sometimes but I do because I love him. Not that our worlds are so completely opposite just they're different in many aspects. On that note see you when I have more thoughts
