Whoa! those were the BEST. i bet i still have a rice crispie treat around here somewhere from those nights. everyone from northside would be there... "studying," drinking coffee and filling themselves up on sugar loaded snacks provided for us. i think one of those nights have been the very first time i used the mustard pick up line on a guy.   oh the "studying" counless hours of wasted time, staring off into space, talking about dinosaurs, and any type of philosophical question you could come up with!   I HAVE CHALK AND I'M CRAZY.  one summer night, newman, robert, and i walked around campus, writing messages to fellow ags around campus on anything we could reach.  that was also the time i had the bright idea to go to HEB and chug milk... or the time, we sat around outside on a break, trying to guess people's names as they passed by...   there was just so much going on, so much built up energy inside of everyone, that sitting in a chair just wasn't going to be the release we needed. we needed to be crazy. we were losing our minds.... no sleep, no real food, full of caffine....   there was nothing like it. :)  it's not the same, but this time, I HAVE DRIED FRUIT AND I'M CRAZY!!  watch out. :)
