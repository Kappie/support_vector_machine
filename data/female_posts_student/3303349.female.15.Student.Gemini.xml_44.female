I stood by and watched as she broke down to tears. I saw as each of the ladies in turn cheered her up, but yet she cried as she laughed. I saw her daughter rush out of the room when she heard news of the letter. I heard her story of how she wrote him twice a week or more and how much they both missed him. This war has hit close to home and put people I love into pain that they don't deserve.
