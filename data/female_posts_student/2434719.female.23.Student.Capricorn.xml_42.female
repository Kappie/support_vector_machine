AND THAT IS ALL I HAVE DONE! i'm going to get dressed soon, do some more laundry (oh yeah i did that too), and then take spot to petsmart to buy her a new toy.    and then...  who the hell knows. i kinda wanted to day to put my new room together, finish unpacking, and most importantly, finish all the laundry.  good god my dog smells right now. she just got back from a long walk...PU!  and i will try not to write about my dog all summer. here's one for ya... CALIFORNIA! this time, DO say it in a jimmy from the wizard voice... california??  i'm excited. i'm almost sad to leave houston so soon, cause i havn't seen everyone yet. but that's okay, i'll be back..  i went and tried on my dress to my friend vanessa's wedding. i love weddings, but sometimes i hate paying for the dresses. oh well.  it's black, so i'll probably be able to wear it again. :)  but yay weddings... all those wedding dresses... it makes me feel like such a girl, but you know i wanted to try them all on.  i just do  shit i have to go... i have to do this when spot is gone cause she's getting jealous. later!
