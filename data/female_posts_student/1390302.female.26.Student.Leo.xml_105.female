It's 8:58am and Matt has gone to pay for our home with his dad, but lucky me, I got to stay home.  Since we just got Galileo yesterday we were concerned that he and Chummer would kick each others @$$ if we left them here alone.    I understood yesterday, before we got Galileo, but not now.  Chummer and Galileo LOVE each other.  They've been playing and having fun all night.  As a matter of fact, they're both sleeping on the bed, cuddled up together, because they played so hard last night and all morning.  It's so cute, makes me wish I had a digital camera...makes me wish I had some film for my film camera for that matter.  So anyway, back to my point.  I got left home!  Needless to say, I am not happy about it.  I have been so anxious about this move it's not even funny. My ulcer is killing me and now I'm being left home to wonder if they're taking care of everything the way I'd like and knowing that they probably are not.  Luckily, Matt's dad C.L. is really, really responsible about these things, it helps cut down my worry.  To compound the issue, I am alone at home with no car.  Instead of letting me drive him to his dads, Matt took the car and is leaving it parked at his dads all day.  What if I have an emergency?  What if Chummer or Galileo have an emergency?  GGGGGRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!  Kristyn
