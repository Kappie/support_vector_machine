"julia, get out here NOW" "JULIA!" ughh... so anyway, today was OK. i thought that i was going to have to stay home from school because of lack of sleep, but i pulled through OK. antoinette, caroline, katie, and i read a fashion mag. that had lots of really cool stuff in it. i've been leaving katie out a lot, and for that i am sorry.  i have to go and clean the kitchen, so more later.
