I myself am a severely disturbed girl who is extremely bitter about her father's despicable decision to divorce (great alliteration there) and am a sufferer of frequently fluctuating (damn, there it goes again) moods.  And sometimes I have to pry my foot out of my mouth, like yesterday, but at least (usually) I can laugh at myself.  Please check out my website http://www.livejournal.com/users/divamercury/ if you want to know more...my fingers aren't cooperating at the moment and I think I should stop for a bit.  Hello, all.  Talk to you soon.  Keep reading my website if you want to.  ~Z
