Although don't wait too long, because they may never come, and on your deathbed you will curse my children. I the children I will have eventaully. Okay, I can't promise that will happen either... and now its time to shut up.   The party went pretty well. Eric told people to show up at 6, and so naturally since EVERYONE wants to be fashionablely late noone showed up until 8ish. We played Mafia for awhile, and that was fun too, cause we had some actual good games which is never garrenteed to happen.   My parents were gone most of the week. I really don't mind being alone anymore... before when I didn't talk to people for days at a time, I'd become depressed. Lately though, im just good to go for funness 24/7 and happy to be alive... However, my Dad told me that whenever my mother asks me if I missed her, the default answer is YES; but when I'm cutting apples in the kitchen at 4am wearing nothing but socks and a scarf, its hard to say that other people would be an improvement to my sitch. Reguardless, I shouldn't take time to think about it when she expects an immediate answer.   JAMES YOU MOTHER OF A CRIZZNATCH!!! I can't believe you went to Valve headquarters!! I've been reading about that shiz since the begining of forever and stuff! why can' *I* be a witness to illegal software exposure... on the other hand... what kinda sites you been digging through lately JAmes? eh?! AYE?! haxor sites!! that what I'd guess... so take your reward, but remember the people like me who DON'T use google to find what their looking for.   I'm starting on my project for my college success class.. its called "Sleep: Every Student's Battle". It'll include stuff I pull out of psychology journals as well as detailed illustrations (a picture of sleepy time bear + a GI Joe = Sleep) all to demonstrate why sleep is so importent. I'm going to draw connections from the benefits of good sleep to everything from a healthy libito to the lifespan of the oil filters in your car. Sleep is where its at... which is ironic because its what I should be doing right now as opposed to this journal. I'll end this journal, because I want to sleep... but to be truthful, I know in the back of my mind that I will end up playing Master of Orion 3 for at least another hour. mm. The more I think about it the qwiker I wantto endthisjournalokbye.  "You sit on a throne of lies!" -Elf (Will Ferrel to dress up Santa Clause)
