One more day of school on Friday and then it March break. I can't wait! My parents and I are going to a small family party for my birthday. I get my gifts next week before my birthday.  My birthday is on March 11 and I will be back here in Fredericton by then.   I think I will be going to Edmundston with Uncle Ed. If he can get the day off on Monday he will go. If not then I will be taking the bus. It's been awhile since I have taking the bus to Edmundston. The last time was in December of 2000. Anyways I have to get to class and I have to do a bit of studying before my French mid-term. Have a nice day!
