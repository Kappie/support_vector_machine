My groupmates, lucy and stuart were actually playing with the kids.. lucy is on call today and stuart timetabled for the play verandah. i didnt think it would help me pass my exams if i joined them playing with the kids so here i am .. about to start typing the CF case history i took in this morning. I just found out from stuart that we did not have to present a case every single day for the attendance signature.. we just have to attend the wards. d-uh.. and ive been running around like a mad rabbit trying to get cases to present.. not that ive got many. But thats good news.  ohh... the Bollywood star search ended last night with the fat lady Rupak mann winning the competition. japs nak gelak japs.. EHEHEHEHEHE .. EHEHHEHEHEHEH ... i am not laffing cos she;s fat .. im laffing to show that FAT PPLE CAN WIN. like that girl who won Pop idol.. michelle.. she is clinically obese as well.. and she is the UK's reigning POP IDOL. ironically tho'.. now that the bollywood star search has ended, channel 4 has decided to replace it with a prog about fat pple called YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT.  last night i felt a deep pang of missing golliwog. eh? is that correct usage of the word pang? heh watever. Its been a couple of days since he last called.. just 2 days but when u r used to talking to someone every single day .. 2 days seem like an eternity. i sent him a very sarcastic email just now.But one thing about this guy is that sarcasm doesnt quite work on him .. oh well. If he cares for me.. he would call first.End of story.
