I didn't go for OCF this fri nite..thot I'll stay hme and attempt to do my first chapter of my thesis...but as usual the procrastinator will find all distractions to stop wrk.. oh yah, watch American Sweetheart starring Catherine Zeta Jones, John Cusack (one of my favourite actor) and Julia Robert.. I forgot that I had watch it before but heck anything to get away frm wrk...   While watching TV, decided to eat curry again with roti (I tend to overcook) and made dessert for myself (sago with gula melaka and coconut milk) but after eating that I feel even lousier... like wanna puke..my head swirl abit and now I'm having a cuppa fruit tea to ease the discomfort... I reckon that whenever I'm stress I get these bouts of wanting-to-throw-up... not good and my whole body gets outta whack... I eat crazy stuff (ie snacks which I normally abstain frm) and not exercise (tiz reminds me to go swimming on Sun, if possible, before church) Probably, I'll do some sit-ups before I sleep tonite..juz to get my tummy down as well...  I'm really scared shitless for my thesis coz I find that my research has been not up to sratch and also I've been mucking ard tooooo much...juz got my results back today.. not first class honours grade but second upper... this means that next semester I've got to get all H1 in order to get my first class honour... aiya how...stress..  My casual wrk is all fun even though I wrk for 3 hrs per day.. I learn some Cantonese and Italian each time I go in... Oh I can speak Cantonese but juz need some brushing up and correct my chet chet Singaporean Cantonese... I learn how to say drinking straw, pineapple, banana in Cantonese and for Italian, I can say "the shop is closed", "go home", "crazy", "good morning" and "breaking balls" (oops nothing noti it's juz an Aussie slang) I can count frm 1-4 in Italian..Yes, Nick said that soon he'll make a wog outta me!! Cool... I muz increase my vocab. Somehow it's sad that I can only say "no" in Russian and "Good morning", "Good afternoon", "Good nite" in German... I reckon it's more fun learning a language through direct contact with people than frm language classes or frm books...   I borrowed some books frm library... Babylon by contemporary Russian author Victor Pelevin... Immortality by Milan Kundera (since I love his novel The unbearable lightness of being) and The Book of Laughter and Forgetting by Kundera as well...If I don't have to do my chapter, I'll be diving into my bks for the next few days... it'll be a pure joy to juz stay in bed the whole day not getting outta bed to brush my teeth, bathe, eat and even drink... in bed reading my book.. it's a luxury!! I hope to read more Russian authors's books like Solzhenitsyn and Tolstoy... the thin line between propaganda and disguise of critical commentary of socialism... One tends to ponder on the ideology behind the text.. is the author: a propagandist or a critique of the regime?? It is amazing to read a novel and see how the story reveals the social condition of a bottled-neck society yet running parallel to the regime's guidelines of publication... each utterance muz me made with careful consideration... This is a craft...   Darn, I won't be catching the ballet performance by the Sydney Dance Company entitled Shades of Gray tomorrow coz I hav not done my wrk yet... Pity, pity... Gotta give it a miss..
