Whenever someone calls wanting to place a classified ad, we have to redirect them to a different office in a different town that handles such ads for all of the publications under this certain company.    From my experience, when I let them know and begin to read off the phone number they need to call, they interrupt me and say, "why do I have to call there?" (even though I had just explained it) or even better, "you guys don't do ads in your office?"  Um, isn't that what I just said?  lol.  I'm the last person that needs to be answering a phone in an office.  :)  So I put C's (won't say his name here) final column in the paper today and read it over.  He's headed for ECU (as am I in a year or two) and also intends to major in Communications.  I would normally think it'd be pretty cool to possibly see someone from my town around campus up there in Greenville, but I just don't know about the guy.  His last column was on abortion, and as I suspected, he's just as conservative as ever.  Several of his columns over the course of the past 10 months have leaned to the extreme right, and it's taken everything within me not to send him a nasty response to any of them.    His abortion piece nearly put me over the edge when he very bluntly called pro-choicers ignorant.  I hope ECU teaches him a few things about journalism.  It is one thing to use such strong language or insults in a one-on-one debate; it is entirely another to use the newspaper as a media by which to blatantly bash not just an opposing viewpoint, but the group of individuals who disagree with you.  Editorial/commentary or not, you don't just resort to name calling because you think you can.  I felt like he took advantage of the opportunity to let his voice be heard and wasted a lot of reader time with the way in which he presented himself.  He was extremely lucky to have been given the opportunity to express his views during an election year.    It's nice that he does indeed write with passion, and does so very well, but I think his ego needs to subside.  Taking a more modest, direct approach (he uses a lot of silly, sarcastic fluff) in your writing will get you farther in the game, and you'll be much more respected in the end.  Then again, with his brand of "journalistic integrity?  What's that?" writing, he should fit in nicely with today's crop of controversial wannabes so many news channels and major newspapers are laden with.    Well, it should be interesting if I end up in any of his classes at ECU.  ;)  Speaking of ECU, look what my mom got me for my birthday.            A cute hoodie and what they literally call "butt shorts."  lol.  I know, it's not my birthday yet and I shouldn't know what she got me, but there were a few different hoodies to pick from and she asked which one I wanted.  :)  Unfortunately there weren't any in the school's colors (purple and gold) that I liked, so I picked the next best thing.    Oh, and my poor Echo is getting random scratches out of nowhere.  It's really starting to annoy me.  So is all the rain.  I cleaned the car thoroughly and four days later the rain comes and then a hurricane hits.  :(  There's no point in attempting to keep a car clean in eastern North Carolina.  Seriously.    But luckily tropical storm Earl died off and is leaving the weekend clear so we can head up to Busch Gardens for my birthday.  I love roller coasters.  Anyone who's been to Busch Gardens Williamsburg will tell you the Apollo's Chariot rocks.  Heck, I love that whole amusement part.  The entire Williamsburg area is just gorgeous and the park is no different.    They've designed it to have separate "country" areas.  I love the Italy section.  The last time we went, we watched the show they put on there and they asked my sister to volunteer to play the part of a waitress while a guy sang a song to her.  In it he talks about a girl named Angelina the waitress.  Guess what my sister's name is?  Angelina.  lol.  We got a kick outta that.  I hope the weather is decent when we go.  The last time we went (a month or two ago), the weather was perfect.  I hate standing in long lines in the heat, but it wasn't hot at all.  It's probably silly to expect a repeat performance of that, but we'll see.  I'm still waiting for classes to start.  It seems like Wednesday will never get here.  Ahhhh.
