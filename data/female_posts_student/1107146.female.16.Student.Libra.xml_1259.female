It's hellshine over here when Katie (my sister) is on her period...Katie also has a penchant for selfishness and a twisted sense of justice. She must always have her way or there is no way...and then the aftershocks therein: slamming doors, whining, crying, yelling, and my mom stupidly sitting there and just repeating over and over it's just the way she was brought up. Well mom,  YOU  brought her up, so why not just CHANGE something? LORDY. Sorry, but I've been ULTRA mad at my sis lately and the whole twisted sister thing just sort of brought all that frustration to mind.  Of course Abby is the coolest. Look at her feet, for Pete's sake. Look at her smallness in general. Look at the fact that she said "Boy howdy, are they neato" in her last post...I don't think I've heard that phrase since 1955, and my mom was, like, one then, if at all. And elephant socks, bonus. Okok, I'll stop before I get the "psycho stalker" brand across my forehead and Rosie gets too jealous again :)  YAY LINDS on the math projects, you posted something similar in my BLog and I figured this would be the first place you would go, so I'll congratulate you here. Umm....what was the project by the way? Heh, sorry if I'm being an ignoramus, I haven't been able to read much lately because of hellacious fourth period (my usual computer slacking time) drillings on PowerPoint, and recording sessions/visits to the ER/awards ceremonies eating up my time after I get home. And you probably sat there and told me a thousand times in fifth, and I was probably sitting there nodding my head and laughing when it seemed appropriate, all the while waltzing in that little exciting electric impulse world in my brain, somewhere out there.  Don't know about the rest of you, but I'm stoked for the party guys. It may be a small, informal gathering (and considering some elements therein, it could be chaotic) but it'll be great. I don't know what to bring tho. Suggestions, perhaps? I probably won't even read this until it's too late anyway...tomorrow, I wake up and hit the showers, then, with the towel still around my waist, run downstairs and open the door for Alex and a stand-in lead guitarist and try not to be called a fag for opening the door being essentially nekked, then I run upstairs and record for  five and one half hours , or until my fingers start bleeding, because, and mark me on this, we're going to get this EP done and cut a deal with the record company before summer is over. Alls we need is five songs, and if you read the latest BLog we've now got it. Ok sorry guys, this is boring, but I'm just stoked about everything so much I'm gonna pop. It's going to be an awesome weekend, der perfekte cap-off for a pretty lousy week.  Goodbye fair BLog and all the happy citizens who dwell within.
