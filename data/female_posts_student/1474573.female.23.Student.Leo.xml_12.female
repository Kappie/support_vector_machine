We should be able to get it by reading the poem. If there is something missing that you wanted in then you have to rewrite, if people are misunderstanding it completely over and over, you have to rewrite   (B) You can post informative stuff like quotes, translations, notes to obscure references, stuff you'd include if you published it.  2. You CAN post questions (the more specific the better) such as      "does this metaphor work" or "is this line clear" or questions to guide the critique  3. Can't think of anymore rules.....heck who needs em. Do what you will, don't go easy on me, stay honest and true  peace and poetry
