What did Grant do to get on the bill?  (Seeing as no one else is going to know the answer to that.)  He signed into law a bill that devalued the currency and appointed the head of the commission that instituted these changes.  Oh, yeah, he also was a lousy guy.  Sounds like a great person to have on such a valuable piece of paper.  Bureaucracy is fun!
