See, me and Ashley wanted Brandon to go...(she wanted to meet him) but I couldn't get a hold of him lol!! We had fun though lol...the movie was at 7:45pm, and went till 9:30. Then we walked to Alicia's lol...it took us like a half hour or 45 minutes, in the dark lol but it was fun. We hung out at Alicia's till about 10:30...then Alicia and Felicia had to go to Alicia's moms (Felicia's dads...confusing huh lol? I know).
