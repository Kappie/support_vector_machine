I would have brought a sandwich if you guys were planning to have dinner there. I hope the coffees are not cut-throat price..no wait, of coz they are. Don't mind me and the thermos if I do come with one. And OoOO we get to dress up nicely for that day. *Claps* Now I have a reason to wear that formal top which I've kept in the cupboard for like a year.  Secondly; Paul is a master eater.   Thirdly; I must make it a point to sleep by 2AM.  and last but not least; Work out, bitch. Work out! Atleast 5 times a week!  Yup. Alright then. G'night, darlings.
