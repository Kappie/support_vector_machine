The alarming prospect of having to find a job soon, and the endless tunnel of my dissertation research spell "need to change" on the wall. In order to be ready for my career after graduation, I really need to develop my self-regulation skills and interpersonal skils. These are things that I did not have a chance to focus on as I was growing up, and now it's becoming obvious that they are the causes for most of my current problems.  So here is my blog. The idea is to write at least one paragraph a day about my research progress (new ideas, etc), and at least one paragraph about my personal change project. I know this will be a struggle given my spontaneous personality, but this is part of growing up... The point of the blog on research progress is to train myself the habit of being more reflective on my dissertation research, and push myself to create some excitement about this work. After all, if I want others to be fascinated about the work that I spent 2 years doing, I need to be really fascinated about it first. Writing about it will hopefully build up some of that. Secondly, I want to make sure that I'm making steady progress on it on a daily basis, instead of doing the work the day before meeting my advisors, which shows no motivation or leadership at all.  At the same time, I know that fancy theories in the abstract is not going to get me far in the work place. While I'm working at ACCP, it's pretty obvious to me that my biggest problem is self-regulation. I have the skills to finish things fast, I have the knowledge to give good suggestions, I know that I should think more about these things in my spare time, and then I'll be able to contribute good ideas on the table. There are a lot of other things that my reason could while instruct myself to do while I'm there. In reality, almost subconsciously, there is this force that lures me to do something more fun than the projects, so think about something more fascinating than how this company operates. It is very alarming how hard it is for me to control those thoughts and acts so that I could be a more valuable contributor to the company. I should be quite shamed of myself. It reminds me of the experiment done on children about regulating themselves not to take the candy when the adults leave. I'm very well aware of where my weakness is going to lead me in the future, but I still haven't developed enough strength to deal with it yet. I still don't have good habits developed.   In addition, I have this tendency to do things at the last minute, which shows the lack of strategic initiative, proactivity, and leadership. If I cannot be proactive, cannot control my own behavior, and do not have good interpersonal skills, I will not be a good leader. However, if I could develop myself in those three areas before graduation, I believe that I have the talents to be a well-liked consultant, and a successful leader.   With these thoughts, I start my blog, to help myself go through this journey of growth.
