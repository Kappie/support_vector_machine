Just remember that it's his deal now...and that I have that ice cream for you.  Of course, you can only have it if I'm allowed to have a couple of bites.    It's nice to know that I'm not the only person not in Spanish...if that makes any sense at all.  I used to live in Arizona, but that doesn't seem to help my Spanish speaking skills.  Oh well, whatever.  French would rule, if my teacher wasn't so annoying, mean and such a hard grader.  You know those people that ruin something for you, when you used to love it?  Well, that's him...totally killed french for me.  Luckily this is the last year that i have to speak to him!  Thank God!    Hey, if any of you are up to it, my school is putting on a production of Fiddler on the Roof.  A bunch of my friends from school are it, and so I'll be going quite a bit.  If  anyone wants to come with me and make fun of it, please feel free.  I can get more info for you later if you want to come...it should be good.
