Without purpose, why do anything? why get up in the morning? why go to bed at night? why do the dishe? take a shower? brush your teeth? Most of the same questions can be asked when you are alone. Not just alone, but lonely. I have been alone yet not felt lonely. and I have been in a room full of people and felt utterly alone. Although I never wish again to be so completly and totally dependent on another person that they are my sole purpose in life, life without someone to share it with - I mean truly share it with - is pointless, empty, and hollow. But my life does not hinge on just one person. For the first time in my adult life, I truly have a mass (a small mass, perhaps better called a cluster) of people in my life. Although he gets angry (defensive?) when I say he is number one in my life, Dennis is number one, the center of my cluster. Not that long ago, my children where, and should have been, number one, but that is no longer needed or appropriate. Just as John and her kids are the center of Becky's life, and Dominic and Jimmy the center of Jessi's life, and Mike is learning how to develope his own life and support system, Dennis is my center. Not only my center, but my best friend and he keeps me grounded, focused, and happy. Of course, though, next come my children, grandchildren and my son-in-law. What a wonderful family they make! I am so proud of them all, and they have just barely begun their lives! Becky and John and their wonderful crew. I am so proud of how hard they both work to provide a happy home for those kids and for each other. And Jessi! Working hard to better herself and not allow herself to fall into the easy outs available to young, single mothers. She could have so easily sat back and let herself became a welfare mother, but she refuses and continues to be the best she can be! Michael, what can I say? I am so glad to see him finally happy and acting like a semi-normal teenage boy. He has so much potential; if only I can figure out how to make him see it for himself! But my life is no longer just my family. It is a new experience for me. I have friends! Iryna, Glenda, Ginny, Kevin, Stacy and Eric, Mike and Roxie, even Sally, for that matter! Last Saturday night was so neat... Dennis and I going over to Kevin and Ginny's for supper and an evening sitting with friends on the patio in the warm summer night, just relaxing and shooting the breeze. How do I explain what it means to me to do something so simple that other people seem to take for granted? What it means to me to know that I have friends, female friends, that I can call up - or who I know will call me - when I am disgusted with Dennis for doing some fool 'man' thing? After so many years of isolation, of no real friends, of thinking that no one would ever like ME, I can not believe that this is truly my life.        Not only do I never have to be alone or lonely, I have purpose in my life. Granted, not every day do I have wonderfully important things to do. Especially right now, often I wake in the morning and wonder why I should get out of my bed. But it is a temporary thing. It is a waiting thing... and it is a summer thing. I have a job! Yes, right now it is extremely boring due to lack of people on campus during the summer. But the job has potiential, and it gives me the opportunity to sit in front of a computer for ungoddly number of hours and do what I want on a top of the line computer and high speed internet access AND GET PAID FOR IT! And it gives me something to do while I wait for classes to start back up in two weeks. Only two more weeks! I love learning! and I have so much to learn still. I love the classrooms, the discussion, the exchange of ideas. Though granted, often in the classes I am in there is little change of ideas, I manage to find some exchange with my friends and with my teachers.        This coming semester is going to be a tough one. Working 20 hours a week plus taking 15 credit hours (5 classes) will not be easy. They are tough classes, too. Spanish II, Math, and three computer classes. All of them will be lots of work outside class. Usually I have at least one class that I can BS my way through - mostly theory type classes, for example my philosopy class and the History class. All of my classes this semster will be long hours of reading and work at the computer. But I can not wait for it to start!        Ok, these ramblings have been going on long enough for tonight.        Later!
