There was a whole 5 weeks of elective and, since getting back, the past week where I simply couldn't be bothered to write anything. But don't worry, a  HUGE  update is coming soon... here's a quick preview of a few topics it'll cover:  1.) A huge fashion faux pas - sandles with socks (I shudder to even think of it)  2.) An apparent world expert on influenza (Not nearly as exciting as it sounds)  3.) Memories of some real  chunky monkeys ! Well, what more can be expected in a nation with chairs in neurology sponsored by 'Burger King'. Not to mention Burger King branches in children's hospitals.  4.) Lots of driving on the wrong side of the road  5.) Some very warm, sunny weather  6.) Excellent site-seeing: San Fransisco, The Grand Canyon, Alcatraz, Yosemite National Park  7.) The incredible hotel room that stank of urine  And not forgetting (I know I can't):  8.) My amazing patience! How I avoided shouting at him I'll never know.
