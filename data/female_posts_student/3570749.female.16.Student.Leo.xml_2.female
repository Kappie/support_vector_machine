So anyways the past month I have been quite busy...went to oregon, go to parties, and gettting everything ready for my party, PLUS me and my friend Aqua are planning a Harry Potter party, to celebrate his 16th birthday.  That is going to be really fun.  I found out just yesterday that the 6th Harry Potter book is going to be Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.  Wow! Some of my HP fan/friends have been wondering who the half blood prince is?  I would like it to be James Potter, which means that harry is too.  Oh well my friend wants it to be Sirius Black...aka padfoot.  But I think any of the marauders should be the prince, EXCEPT WORMTAIL! Damn to the depths with him! Well got to go find some more gossip....
