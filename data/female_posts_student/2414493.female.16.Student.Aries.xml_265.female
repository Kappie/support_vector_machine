It occurred to me this morning over brushing my teeth that the cord is everything between all those memories: graduation, journalism, etc. and me. I can't print them unless I find that Barnes and Noble bag (I even remember it was a Charlotte's Web one!). I've looked all over the library and a little in my room. Austin was definitely the last person to use it. Would I be stupid enough just to buy another cable? Or a card that prints?   And then volunteer at the hospital. Early. I only hope Isa isn't there or she'd have a cow.  By Thursday, I'll know my SAT scores. That's kind of scary, particularly since I'm not in the school mode right now. I bet they know what I got: they've changed Math 1 and Math 2 to Math 2 and Writing, so they've processed my stuff.  That missing camera stuff is really bothering me. Hm.
