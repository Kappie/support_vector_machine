Besides that, I'm waiting for Jason to send me the photos we have taken this afternoon at the Hair Salon. It's funny how Jeremy's hair has turned out. But it's so totally rad! I love it! I think we all owe it to Dino. Thank you Dino. Hahaha. ;) Here are they:             I miss so many people. Especially Nana and Fiona, because Nana has returned to Malaysia for her hols, while Fiona and I seldom meet up cos' she stays really far away. I miss Jeremy, Jason and Simon too, but I'm glad I got to meet up with them today, and on most Fridays. Jeremy and Simon insisted that I go to Jurong East library to meet up with them this afternoon, so I did. I loved the bean bags and the 4th story. They're so modern. And the sofas were huge and pretty, they are red in colour!   I think I will study Chemistry now. I can't quite get to sleep, and Punk'd is on MTV. Hahaha!
