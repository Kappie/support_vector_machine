I know it's not SUCHA GREAT NEWS but i feel verry happy becuz its been years since my family want out for an outing. I'm extremely overjoyed. But i have doubts too.....You must have wonder why does it take my family SUCHA long time just to go for an outing....dats bcuz, whenever we plan to go anywhere, we always end up NOT GOING..you get what i mean? They will find excuses that it is going to rain laa and all taht BULLSHIT!!! I hate it when that happens...dats why i prefer to go out with my frends more than my family. As you know, iam a very sensitive girl so i tend to get hurt easily. HAIZ.....wad a DARN life i have huh?
