How cool is that when I was young I would have never thought of getting this old or knew what I would be doing when my sister was 20.  Well the sad thing is everyone grows up and moves on but on that note sometimes just when you thought you moved on something happens and you realize you didnt move and you dont know why the hell you would want to ever move on.  I know everyone prolly thinks I am mean and I make fun of ppl most of the time I do it just b/c I dunno bored and some ppl deserve it but there is one person who I talk about but I dont want to anymore I only did it so that I wouldnt worry about him and maybe it would make me feel better.  Well see my ex boyfriend and I broke up about a month ago it took me a little while to get over him and I had my great friend sarah who helped me along with alot of other ppl I guess and pt who is like a brother and would just make me laugh b/c all he wants to do is beat his a$$.  I love my friends.  My friends not my social ppl.  Well I broke up with my ex b/c I found out all this stuff and I didnt like it and I felt that no one should ever have to go through that.  Well we talked about everything and he made me feel like I was the one who was wrong about everything and he told me all that stupid stuff about how you know every guy will tell you they care and they love you and anything that will just make you feel happy or sad or whatever.  After that we decided to be friends and I was ok with that b/c he was moving and I figured you know what we would never see each other until he came back to visit we would just talk on the phone and that was cool.  My guy friends and Sarah made sure I had fun mostly every weekend b/c they are just great friends.  Well Sarah and I went to South Padre at the beginning of July and it was a blast so much fun you should go.  And as I was hoping that when I got back my ex would have already moved so I didnt have to see him I was also hoping that I know this is PATHETIC but that we would see each other and maybe get back together and I know that honestly that wouldnt happen b/c he is moving.   Well my luck he moved like the monday we got back from Padre and I was happy to hear he was gone well at least I acted happy to hear that b/c in a way I was and in another way I wasnt.  So then whenever I got around all my friends we started talking about him and stuff like that so I was feeling better and I was just single and having fun whenever I went out no worries.  Well about thursday night I went to go check my cell phone to see if anyone called me and no one ever does so I was so excited to see the phrase "1 MISSED CALL" on my phone, but when I looked to see who it was I dont know if I was excited or angry or scared to see that my Ex had called me liek 10 minutes ago.  So I decided whether or not I should call him back and me being the idiot that I am called him back.  We talked and he told me he moved and I said yeah I know and he said he was so sorry he didnt get to tell me bye and he misses me so much.  So I was like o dang it I just got over you well at least convinced myself that I got over him and then he said what are you doing tomorrow and I said just sitting here cleaning and he said well can I come see you and I didnt want to be rude so I said yeah.  Well then it was the next day and he came over talk about nervous I was so sick all day like butterflies in my stomach b/c I havent talked to him in about almost a month, like face to face.  Well when he got here I let him in and when we were together and if he ever came over we would sit together and watch tv well this time I sat on the floor like across the room and he sat in a chair on the other side.  We talked like we use to and acted like nothing had ever happened.  Neither one of us has either told each other how we still feel so we just acted like we were good friends and that is all.  Well he got ready to leave and I was about to walk him out and I knew this was going to be the last time I would ever see him again for awhile and I kept telling myself at least give him a hug.  And when we got to the door I was too scared as to what might happen, so he was kinda looking at me and he said can I "AT LEAST" have a hug and I said well yeah.  So we hugged and I then realized that I wanted a kiss so bad and I miss him so much more than I would have ever imagined.  Well I talked to him that night on the phone and we just talked about nothing particular and then I had to get up early so I told him goodnight and talk to him tomorrow.  Well tomorrow was here and we started talking and I asked him if he was nervous at all the other day at my house and he said kinda at the end b/c I wanted to give you a kiss and I knew then that I could never forget this kid he was my frist true love.  We talked and he said that he made the biggest mistake of his life letting me go.  And all that stupid crap that guys tell you he told me again and it just made me happy and sad and angry b/c I spent a whole month trying to get over him and now I am back where I started caring more and more about him and I dont know if I will ever stop loving him.  We were together for 1 yr. and almost 6 months.  I would have to say that was one of the best years and almost 6 months of my life.  If someone ever asked me when where you the happiest in your life and I would tell them when I was with Keith.  He may not have told me I was pretty the way other guys do I mean he did a couple times but the way he made me feel and the way he looked at me I could tell and that is all I needed to know.  We had some of the most fun together.  We made each other laugh and we always knew what each other was about to say or do.  I miss those days, but I know that nothing will ever be the same.  So I guess this time I really do have to move on and learn how to get over him and be without him.  I am just glad that I have the support of my friends there may not be many of them b/c I live in Alvarado and ppl here are fake I know I am but I do know who my real freinds are and I am satisfied with them.   Love ya   Jess
