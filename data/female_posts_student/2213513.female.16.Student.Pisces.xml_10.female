Christina and I were belting it out as we drove through all these side streets to get to sandy. Christina, Kari, Jessica and I all went downtown Tuesday. We tried on prom dresses at Mariposa in Lloyd Center just for fun, Kari found a really cute pink one with silver stars all over, Christina complained that she didn't have anything to hold up the dresses, but CLEARLY she has more than I do...Jessica tried on a less dressy one that was really cute too. I tried on a really cute polka dot dress that wasn't dressy enough to wear to winterball and too dressy just to wear to school and a black version of a dress Christina tried on. Finally yesterday I got some color, Kari and I laid outside like the whole day. My cousin Stephaniegot here yesterday, she lives in LaGrande, she drove up because she was catching a plane today to see her boyfriend in Alaska. I think next summer I'm going to go with her for like a week. She says some parts of Alaska can get up to 80 degrees in the summer. 2 days till kari's bday!! 2 days till i leave for california!! 16 days till camp!! Yeah, I'm leaving for california on Kari's bday, but I'm going to call her before i leave, at like 8am, to wake her up and say HAPPY BIRTHDAY! You know you love it Kare. People keep talking about how I'm so close to going off to college and Its starting to worry me, what if I don't get in to either college i want to go to? Right now I'm really torn between University of Hawaii, Manoa and New York University. Two very different schools that are both very far away. That's what I want though, to be far away. I don't want to stay in Oregon, I want to go be on my own. Actually It would be nice if like at least one of my friends was with me, andboth Lynzi and Karisaid that they might want to go to college in Hawaii. If i go to NYU then my family will all be like half an hour to an hour or so away. Anyway, it's summer so I'm not going to worry myself with those things! *kate  ~your smile is the most genuine thing, that i've ever seen
