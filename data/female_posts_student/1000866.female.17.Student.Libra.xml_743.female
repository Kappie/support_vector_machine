And, I had one more day that I could take off. Wheee! I'm going to lunch today with Kathryn and them because it's Kathryn's last day before she leaves for camp for three weeks. Bummer!!     The Great America thing for next week is totally working out. So far it's Diane, Alex, Scott, Matthew, and me. Chri said he'd really try, which is awesome of him and we invited Peter too, but I'm not sure when he'll be back from his family reunion. I hope he can come. It'd be good to spend some time with him before he goes off to college.     Anyway, I must be off. Lots to do. :)
