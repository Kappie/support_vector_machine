At the age of 17 i have delt with a lot of death and i think it just makes me realise that a childish heartbreak should be the least of my worries...self-centered young girl...could descirbe my self to the core... too worried about my own sorrows to feel for others...I think i have a new plan...volunteering...I dunno where but maybe it will take up some times...and get me to not be so self centered! Well I think I have made a mistake in something i did last night....but it made me feel alot better...happier...for the moment, becuase i think it can only end much worse then it started.....i guess the only way i will see is in the unfolding of life...dedication to those who have passed: Matt Clark and pj lugo...
