(he likes them too...but its more fun acting like he bought them for me, hehe!)  He's a really great guy.  he makes me laugh constantly...But anyway...yea so this past weekend was Tax Free Shopping...yea, totally bought ONE thing!! go figure right? i'm so disappointed in myself.  Oh well, now there are going to be MAJOR sales!! woohoo!! (i'm all about sales) ANYWAY... i don't really have anything else to say.  feel free to comment!  Have a great day!
