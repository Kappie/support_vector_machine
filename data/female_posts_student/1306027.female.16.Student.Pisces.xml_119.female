No big surprise on that one eh? Right well, on to my complaining;  Work was completely sucky yesterday. It was only 4 hours, but still. yarg. I did alot of the major Timmy work, like, cleaned out the cap machines, cleaned and stocked the fridges, cleaned period. It was almost surreal really, I mean, who knew Timmy's was hiring people that don't actually work?! Aha! Now there's a good idea. I mean really guys..come on.   Don't get me wrong- a lot of my co-workers are awesome. And most of them actually work.. but then there are those select few who seem to misunderstand what they are actually getting paid for. *sigh* Why can't I be scheduled with Katie, Deep, Matt, Cara, or Caleb all the time?! They work.. and I work.. and it's all good. I would die happy if I were scheduled with them all the time.    To Bad life has a suck factor.  It's like a given, the suck factor. There has to be an equal amount of suck for all good in your life. What they don't tell you is when and where it will rear it's ugly equalization effects. I thought the suck factor wouldn't hit till college.    Boy was I wrong!
