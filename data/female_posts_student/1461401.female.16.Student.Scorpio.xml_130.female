Maybe this will make the friday night football games a little more pallitable.  Heh, what am I talking about? This is band, and band is one thing I just can't stomach.  I've been so tired lately, and school's hardly even started. I have a bunch of homework due tomorrow, but I just can't bring myself to do it right now. Maybe I'll have a little more energy (and patience) after dinner. *yawn*......      *snore*
