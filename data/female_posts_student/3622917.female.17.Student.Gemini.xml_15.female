God never liked people that much  ~Sarah Slean "Angel"  Parents can be so frustrating. Actually just family in general. After Sandy stopped by earlier, one of my dads so called friends came here. So I opened the door for him but he stayed outside the front porch type thing. He was just here to bring back a CD that belonged to my dad. He said he ws sorry about the way that things had gone down. Yeah all righty there buddy, get out. Not that he was in. But whatever. So fine. He leaves and awhile later I call my mum just to say hello. She is at work so I called her there. She was busy so someone said that she would call back in a bit. Anyway, I continued on with my usual lunch time routines. I made my lunch. Kraft Dinner with the noodles boiled for so long that they become mush. Exactly how I like it. I sit and start watching Law and Order. And then my mum calls back. And she is absolutely furious that I opened the door for dad's friend. I mean irate. She asks how many times she has told me not to open the door. I tell her truthfully never because she has never told me anything of the sort. Ridiculous. She just gets angrier and angrier. So I decide that this is stupid and tell her that I just phoned to say hello and now she is getting all mad at me. She says that yes she is getting mad at me because she didn't think that I was that dumb to open the door for a scumbag (yeah she actually used those words... a hopeless case). So I said that I would talk to her later because she was making me feel incredibly angry. And goodbye. So I was so mad by this point I was ready to just start crying. And I did. Right over my Kraft Dinner. Doesn't really make for an appealing meal. It's just so stupid. If she had told me that I wasn't allowed to open the door for people then I wouldn't have opened it. But I am seventeen. It's not like I am some infant who has to be watched over all the time. I am perfectly capable of handling myself with people. I have done it many times before and will again. There is so much that she doesn't even know about me. And I never plan on telling her. She only found out about this guy because he wanted to meet my family. And after that she didn't mention him again. She didn't even notice when we broke up. I was sitting at the computer which is in a central location in my house, crying. And no one noticed. It wasn't just my mum who didn't notice. Not a single person in my house noticed. That just made me feel even worse. Yeah so bad memories. I just feel like shit. I miss all my friends so much. I just want to be better and get drunk. Hahahahaha, I mean it, that is the only thing that I am really looking forward to about not being sick anymore. That and going outside and concerts and such. But me, Erin, and Kirsti all together, all drunk. It'll be a nice little vacation from feeling sick, that is right up to the hangover. Oh well. No matter.  I think I will go now. Before my brother gets home and he starts complaining because he wants to go on the computer. Life sucks today. It has to get better from here. I am hoping for a series of fun emails from best pals tonight. Later...   I guess it's better that you trapped yourself in your own way. And if you want me back you're gonna have to ask.   ~the Used
