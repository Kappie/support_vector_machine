Or at least thats what she used to say.  Considering that she doesn't say it anymore, I conclude that somewhere along the line I learned to contain my fury.  "Don't be angry at the world, because it has no problems with you."  I think that quote is just wonderful.  It's sarcastic, informative, inspiring, and funny all at once.  Too bad I can't remember who Hilary said said it.  Uhg, now I have two of the same word in a row and I'm too tired to reword the sentence so that predicament doesn't ensue.  bleh.  Brie
