It was an HBO special a while back....GOD is it funny! I didn't know he was so evil tho. He cusses like a mug, and his topics for discussion.....COOL! Gross! I never noticed but I sort of tense up when somebody's joking about female anatomy.....as if  I'm  expecting to get slapped in the face by the  EMBODIMENT OF FEMINISM  when that m:f is making the jokes.  I am such a freaking girl it's not even funny. I had my hair in a mini-pony tail today and that is proof.
