The contractor quoted us a price of $800.00 which is cheap for New York standards.  I guess that how these chinese contractors win bids for jobs by quoting very cheaply.  And hiring day laborers when needed.  Were going to have fast food dinners the next few days.  Hopefully I wont gain too much.  I stopped running last week due to  urlLink heel spurs .
