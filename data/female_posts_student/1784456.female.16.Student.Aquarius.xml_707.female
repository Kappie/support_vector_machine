My Dad's going on a boat trip tomorrow! (Random yup!) With my Uncle and other random people! My Uncle owns a boat... but my Dad's only been on one of these boating things once before! I think I've been on it before... all I remember was the horror at having to wear these bright red massive life jackets! Eww, FASHION HORROR! Not that I know any thing about fashion... I'm wearing a string top with trousers! Ah, yes, a bright pink top. (AHH! The mental image! I'm scarred for life!) Hey, you're on me you know! That sounds dodgey... gotta go cause my Dad's doing a BBQ bubi!
