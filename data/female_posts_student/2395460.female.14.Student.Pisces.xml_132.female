All failed, until one day, I happened upon this  urlLink Zojirushi  two-compartment thermal lunch jar in a Japanese department store in New Jersey called  Matsua .  My daughter reported that her veggie chicken nuggets stayed warm for the first time.     Purusing the  urlLink Zojirushi website , I came upon an energy-saving thermal cooking pot, which is essentially an extension of the thermal lunch jar idea.  You bring your stew or whatever to boil on the stove using the inner pan, and then insert the whole thing into an outer container and vacuum-seal it to finish cooking.  Perfect for potluck picnics and tailgate parties.
