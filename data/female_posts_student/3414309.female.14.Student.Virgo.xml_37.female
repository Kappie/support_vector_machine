THEY MADE FUN OF HOW HAPPY I WAS ... PPL WHO DIDNT GO ON FULL SERVICE JUST DONT UNDERSTAND !!! okay and after church ryan and marc came over for a bit,   lol they left and we went to Target ... bought an 80 pack of tampons and a 20 pack for the gentler conception ... is conception the right word?? i dno lol lets just hope ... then natalie had to leave and ju and iwent on a bicycle ride down to the skate park to check out the skaters which ended up bein real fun cuz like nico, seth, kevin, and brian were there (along with jake and many others)   so we hung there for a bit till we finally came home (really hot) and went over to natalies where timmy (my architect italian husband) and erik (julie's whore) came over to watch little mermaid with us ... we tried teachin natalie how to dance at least the tiniest bit normal ... key word tried. and   now ... well now im home !!! and i'm goin to sleep cuz we have an early mornin at the skate park tomorrow! ;) haha fun times fun times. oh and if the person who pranked my cell today is readin this it didn't phase me and it never will okay? xoxo ~meri~
