She then reached not long after .... We are queuing at a quite ok place .... Not very long queue when I first reach .... Then Amy saw her friend and she is queuing up together with the fanclub .... Amy was also part of the fan club but then I was not, so only she could line up together with them ... But I also queue in the line with the fanclub after a long decision ....Cause I joined the fc ..... ["BROKE"]  Then at 12pm, Energy then reached ...OMG .. They was late again .... haiz ..... But I still managed to stand at a position where I can see them totally clear .... We was at the 2nd row ... They were so handsome .. OMG .... Especially Kunda and Shuwei .... Ah Di changed a lot after he cut his hair ... He look more handsome than last time .... They sang 2 songs and then the autograph session started .... I was so anxious wad to tell them and I was like behaving very weirdly .... Then Amy ask me to go first but I dun want ... Haiz ... But then it wad like ... Then I am having sorethroat mahz ... The voice is really weird and when I step up the stage I kept coughing .... The I saw ah di I was like wad "am I going to say ....." Then Amy was right behind me and she say "ah di, ni dai yan jing hen shuai" then I kept laughing.. Next was Kunda...
