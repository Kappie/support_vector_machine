I mean the movie of course; I've been meaning to read the novel for a while, ever since a friend of mine bought it for me, but a little thing called law school has gotten in the way, and before that it was just sheer laziness.  (As an aside: if you have not seen  Barry Lyndon  or have no idea what I am talking about, it's a film directed by Stanley Kubrick and it's great and everybody out there should see it, if for no other reason than it is one of the few good films that Ryan O'Neal ever made.)    Anyway, I suspect most people think of the music that plays during the duel scene toward the end.  Forgive my ignorance of the title of the piece or who composed it.  But whenever I think of the film, the first piece that comes to mind is the Schubert piano piece that plays when Barry is seducing Lady Lyndon.  I guess it's because that scene is, to me, more evocative of the mood of the film, with the candlelight and all.  The film was shot with no artificial light, don't you know?
