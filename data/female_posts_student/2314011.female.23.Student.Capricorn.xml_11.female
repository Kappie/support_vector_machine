Sigh.  Probably has something to do with all that damn charm of his.  At any rate, thanks for the plug hon!  So, it occurred to me that I've been making regular posts alluding to the process of studying for my first semester law school finals, but I haven't actually described what that process (or its significance in the great, wide realm of general understanding) really consists of.  And whether or not anyone's curious, here's the low-down:  Pretty much everyone knows that grades in law school are made up entirely of one (1) exam.  The final.  No quizzes, no assignments, just the final.  Each final's length is determined by the class' credit hours.  One hour of exam-time for each credit hour.  So, a three credit class has a three hour exam.  I've got 4, 3 credit classes, so that makes for 12 hours of exam time.  Yay.   The process leading up to those 12 hours has, thus-far, been an interesting one, I have to say.  The most prevalent study method is outlining.  Basically, students outline their classes and study that sucker up until and including the minute before the exam begins.  Now, at first, I thought outlining wouldn't be too difficult an undertaking.  After all, it's just a matter of organizing information...not a problem for one who LOVES to organize.  And really, it's not "hard" per se, more just hugely overwhelming.  Imagine it...4 months worth of class notes/concepts/theories to get properly arranged in learnable fashion, several of which may or may not have been forgotten around Labor Day weekend.    Only after that's begun does the real fun/actual work begin.  You see, it's not enough to simply know the words and what they mean.  No, there's this little thing called "application" that's actually a pretty big deal around here, shockingly enough.  I mean, sure, I can rattle off the requirements for a remainder in Property, or the Duty/Breach analyses in Torts, or the Parol Evidence Rule for Contracts, but that does shit on an exam.  The name of the game there is: hypotheticals.   An example:  Defendant places white, granular rat poison in an unlabeled can near a coffee pot sitting on a hot plate.  (Why is this a careless, negligent thing to do?  What harm could/should be expected?)  No one (including defendant) knows the rat poison is flammable.  It blows up and physically injures plaintiff standing by the hot plate to pour himself some coffee.   Did the defendant proximately cause plaintiff's injuries?  Should defendant be liable?    That could be a short-answer question, or it could be the basis of an entire final Torts exam, depending.    Similarly,  To A for life, then to B and her heirs To A for life, then to B and the heirs of her body To A for life, then to B if B is 21 before A dies; B is 15 To A for life, then to B and her heirs is B survives A, and if B does not survive A to C and his heirs To A for life, then to B and her heirs, but if B does not survive A, to C and his heirs Are all grants of property, after which the question will inevitably be: what is the state of the title?  Now, all of this is not, in any way, meant to conjure sympathy, pity, wonder or awe...although if you feel the need to express any of those through monetary donations or physical affection, feel free. Instead, it's meant to just give a little glimpse into life as it is for me at the moment, which, I suppose, is the whole point to a blog in the first place.  Jealous? I know it doesn't look like loads of fun on the surface, but really, it's a great time.  Just hope I can remember that in the coming weeks... And now, I shall return to work:  Contracts reading for tomorrow's class.  Yes, in the midst of all this action, we are still learning more material that will of course be included on the final.   Sigh... The drive on Friday will feel good.
