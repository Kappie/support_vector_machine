Part of me wants to tell myself, "Give up, Lydia and go home." Another part just wants to cradle this book in my lap until i fall asleep and cannot retain any more information.   I know a lot of the time it's mind over matter, and that's what troubles me. I haven't taken the bio AP. I did the majority of my learning this past week. I know some of this stuff, but not the names, a major disadvantage when it comes to essays. And yet I know I'm supposed to be confident even though I really don't feel it.  Oh hi. Saprobes are...decomposers. Good.  In a day, I've gone through Jimmy Eat World, Outkast, Postal Service, Death Cab, Usher...just to try to stay awake. Perhaps it's worked. But I have Confessions stuck in my head now. Went to a study session with Erum, Nimo, Ryan, and John Skelly. You look at Nimo, hear him spout off enzymes, location of secretion and function and you know he's a candidate for a 5. Candidate? A surefire 5. It's just the difference between Lydia and retention on the history AP and Lydia and the bio AP.   But hey, I'm getting coffee tomorrow. Incentive enough? We'll see. So much is based on instinct now. I relinquish control. Scary thought.
