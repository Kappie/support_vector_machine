Mom told me a friend of a friend had died. I think that mourning over people is a waste of time and that wishing someone to come back is selfish. Think about it... They finally made it "out", they got to leave, and you think for a second they feel bad about it? No. I came up with a little analogy to go with this idea. If a crab leaves a shell, it hasn't died, it has merely moved on to a bigger and better place. So, should we mourn the shell? Should we be upset by the crabs loftier apirations to move on up? Should we bury, burn, sing to and/or cry over the meaningless shell and beg the crab to come back to it for out own enjoyment? No, because the crab would no longer fit in the shell, and he would soon die. So, hopefully that was comprehensible and a couple of funeral going/can't find closure/use a persons death as an excuse to be pitiful people are sitting at their computers thinking "ah".  got to be going for now, bell rang.
