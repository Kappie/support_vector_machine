I had some serious writers block over the last couple days, but I have been able to pull together a little on the seventh chapter. I expect the next three chapters to be posted in the next week or so.  The way I will be posting the chapters is simple, but could become a little confusing to a new reader. For size sake, I have decided to post the story in six chapter increments. Though I may do this, it will be very unlikely I will publish all six of the chapters at the same point in time. To signify I have updated the post, it's title will be altered to include the new chapter(s).  eg. Saving Grace Chapters 7-9 changed to Saving Grace Chapters 7-12  If you have any questions, please leave a message on my comment board, as well as your e-mail address, and I would be glad to answer them for you as well as I can.   A. Hadley
