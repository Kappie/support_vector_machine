Usually it's not really an amazing new concept, He just needed to open your eyes to something you weren't imagining was possible.  One of God's favorite things to tell me lately is "You have no idea!"  He says it in this completely mischevious voice - sometimes it's really unnerving, because I really do have no idea what He's going to throw me into next...  What the heck am I talking about, anyway?  Well, Sunday night/Monday morning, I worked my second overnight shift at my new job (the rehab residential center for teenagers with drug abuse and mental health issues).  I brought a ton of stuff to do, because last time I was kind of bored by 4 in the morning.  My Slaughterhouse Five book, an art project I'm working on, and my leftover Jimmy John's vegetarian sandwich, because when you're up all night, of course you get hungry at 3:32am.  Plus I have two hours of training videos to watch.  Well, in my nine hour shift, I managed to do all the paperwork we're supposed to do, watch my two hours of training training videos, and eat my sandwich.  (mmmm! cucumbers!)  What the heck did I spend the remaining 6 hours of my shift doing?  I spent it talking to my co-worker Paul.  (there are always two of us on overnight shifts)  Paul is a 22 year old man who is jaded, hates George W. Bush, has experienced extreme poverty, racial oppression, and serious drug abuse by his friends and family.  So what the heck do I and Paul have in common?  Music - particularly jazz and reggae.  Political opinions (heck, everyone has those).  Growing up in the church and hating the state it was in.  A desire to travel - he was an Army brat and grew up in Germany, and wanted to hear all about my trip to Siberia/Russia and Poland.    Again, what the heck is my point in all of this??  Simply this - you just have no stinkin' idea what God is going to do.  No, I didn't sit down and share the "bridge" illustration with Paul and share the gospel with him.  I'm pretty sure he already knows the gospel. (Although you never know, some people grow up in the church and never hear it once, which is scary.)  But I did spend 6 hours exchanging ideas with him, listening to what he had to say, and sharing from my own life and experiences.  I know I made him think, and he made me think, too.  And it's not just about what you do.  It's not just about me "saving" Paul.  It's also about God using Paul to help me think outside the box.  To spur me on to think..."is that really God's ideal, or is it a  Republican  ideal?"  Hmmm.  I have no idea...but God is opening my eyes.
