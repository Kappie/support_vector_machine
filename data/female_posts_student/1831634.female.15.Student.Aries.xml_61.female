I can hardly keep my eyes open!  louisa came over today and we finished our art projects.  finally!  done!  and we're GLAZING our projects in art!  which means we're painting the terra cotta with some chemicals, and when we fire them, they'll come out as pretty colors!  I'm so happy.  =)  We're painting our box, and invidually painting our coil pots.  [I worked w/louisa for the box]  aand now.... I can go sleep!  and read!  and like... do life lesson book.  darn.  and read fanfics!  wow that's so cool.  I realized that a lot of people at jasper annoy the bejeezus out of me.  just so freaking annoying.  grace is annoying me.  maybe I'm jealous.  ha!  in that case, I need some green shirts.  not, of course, that I'm admiting to anything.  I don't like jack.  at all.  AT ALL.  and if you accuse me of liking him, I will bite your head off and never update again in my life.  oh, what the heck.  maybe I do like him.  I dunno.  I just want next week to be over with, then review week to be over with, the exams to be over with, so I can escape to china for a month then come back and do the capitalism fair.  I swear, everyone already thinks I like jack.  I give up.  let me just escape into the anonymity of summer.  let's try some more stream of consciousness.  I'm so tired my eyes itch and i haven't slept in on too long and jack is the most annoying perv on earth.  i don't even know where that came from, maybe it's form that inuyasha fic i was readkin before i started updating this blog.  that must br iit, because i cannot thing o fon epervy thing jthat jack has done.  well eactually yes I can.  i can think o fmany incidences, actually.  maybe he's just too... i dunno.  strange about his sexuality.  i've never met such a queer straight person.  or maybe he's just pretending he's straight.  i'd like that.  i can so totally picture gay jack.  i bet i'm goin to look back on tihs period in my life later when i grow up and laugh at my stupidity.  and absurdity.  oh, well, i'm in the pressent now and i can't chage anything.  i'm typing wiht my eyes closed to get the full stream of oconsciousness effect ehre.  therefore, typos.  lots of them, probably.  louisa came over today and i told her tah tmeng liked jeff.  i cdon't care all tha tmuch , really.  i son't even know why.  maybe it's because of chuan.  so mayube if he kept telling me I like jack, i'll begin believe it sooner or later.  probably not, though.  i don't even know who I like best anymore.  oh, well.  I just want summer to come.  sweet oblivion!  i wonder what suicide feels like.  my mom told me her coworker's daugher commited suicide.  at age thriteen.  i've lived two lyears more already.  i wonder...?  =)
