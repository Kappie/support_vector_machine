I can still hear the noise of the world around me, All of the hustle and bustle All of the screaming and cursing The cars, horns, The people mumbling to themselves. Someone trying to peddle cash from unsuspecting passer bys.  I can hear all of the one sided conversation, of the cell phone usersâ€¦ abusers.  I hear the clink, clink, clink, of bicycle wheels turning round and round. I hear the squeak of the breaks, of an approaching bus, the rumble of thunderous footsteps.   I open my eyes, the blanket of orangey-black  is removed from my eyes  and look around. I see and hear nothing, I am all alone.  So I put on my headphones and walk away. Listening to the sounds of my own world.
