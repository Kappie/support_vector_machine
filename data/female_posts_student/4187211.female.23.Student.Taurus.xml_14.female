Ah Matthew Good, a great show, a great band, a great location, and a stupid audience - what else is new. This is not to say that I didn't throughly enjoy both the opening act, Wil, and Matt Good, they were amazing - especially from our hard won front row spots, but why do people think that shoving as hard as they can the people in front and to the side of them is going to make anyone's experience any better? I seriously had to elbow this guy a few times because he kept pushing up against me, and believe me, I wasn't planning on moving anywhere - we were about as close as you could get without being on stage. I understand that with a rock crowd in a bar, there's expected to be a little pushing and such, but three people body surfing in a not so large venue, come on now that's just a little ridiculous. I think that the aggressive side of me comes out when placed in those sorts of situations, I was just as ready to shove back, and I don't think that me and Tara moved more than a couple of inches the whole night. I certaintly wouldn't want to be a security person at one of those things! When it started getting rowdy, the girl next to me started freaking out a little, and I thought she was going to throw up, so we had to let her out - the security guys were pretty good at making sure the smaller people were doing okay (not that they asked us - we must have looked pretty determined). But I'm ranting. The music was great, he played mostly from his new album and a couple well chosen older songs like "Picture Yourself" (forgive me if I have the title wrong...). And at the end me and Tara managed to pick up one of the set lists and a drumstick (yes, it's a little obsessive, but fun nonetheless) which we got signed by the man himself! Tara was tempted to stalk him back to his hotel, but we decided that would be way too creepy as the streets were fairly deserted and he was walking with two body/security guards... I swear that we're not that obsessed (disclaimer - I was mostly following Tara... really...). One girl asked to have Matt's half finished glass of beer and she got it! ewww, what would you do with that? What ever tickles your fancy I guess (well, not like I can do much with a drumstick, but at least it's keepable). Anyway, if you're a Matthew Good fan, I highly recommend you see him live, but just be prepared to stand your ground if your in the throng.
