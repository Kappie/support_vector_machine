I have nothing but nightmares about him lately...what do they mean? Is it just because he's on my mind? Is it just my own worries playing out? Or am I psychic? Telepathic? What does it mean? Why am I nuts? Why have I allowed this to drive me completely berserk? I am not a crazy person, but I surely feel out of control of my mind and my heart. It's like there is nothing I can say or do which takes away this panic inside of me. It's panic, it's anxiety, it's fear, it's everything...I cannot control it, I hate it. I am beginning to hate myself for it. No, I'm not beginning to, I already do. It's like I feel some strange lifeform has inhabited my body and it just won't leave me alone. But why? Why can't I just buck up and get over him? I have nothing to hang onto, so can you say I'm really hanging on? It's like something attached to my body I can't shake...what is the deal here?
