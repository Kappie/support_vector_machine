I was just watching Newsround (as you do) and they were seeing what people though of Slipknot and every one was saying they're really bad and they can't understand why they call that music! Excuse me! That is music, and if you lot actually got a life and some friends you might find out about it! I'm really good ;) (yeah right) no I mean that I try to respect different types of music, and not just shun them because I don't like them. Just because you don't like a type of music does that give you a right to condemn it? To decide that it's rubbish? I try not to do that because I hate narrow minded people... Ahhh hyper phase! Damn, I'm getting too almightily passionate about this, mind you I am! Mmm... might be the music and the pills I just took as well... did I say pills? *sweat sweat* Hehe, nah, I don't do that. Just pulling your leg. (Hey! Give it back!) Hmm... really need some psychiatric help! Ok Bubi! Keep on head banding guys! (What was that about narrow mindedness?) Aaah, tea! Bi!
