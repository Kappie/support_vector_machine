I agree, Chelsea, I dun think I've ever seen a better sequel. oh, and do you think that Elmer will be a good name for your plant? I think it'd be cute. Either that or Ping. Ping is cute too. And it's a brand of golf clubs. lol. Anyways, it's late. I'll miss you this summer, Chelsea, but I do hope you have fun. Tha'ts what's important, well, that and making money! lol, I'll guard Barry for ya, make sure he doesn't get too flirtatious with other girls. gotta go to bed now, tootles all! ^_^ Love, Shannon "Fire in the Disco!"--Electric Six
