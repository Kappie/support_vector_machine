And I don't mean the small ones you hold, but the big huge ones that you put on your house. It surprised me to see so many people making this purchase. And then I wondered why it surprised me.   The truth of the matter is, but just thinking about celebrating the 4th of July, makes me feel a little embarrassed.   I HATE that I feel this way!    I can't help but wonder what the overall sentiments of this years 4th of July will be. To me, it is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, we are celebrating our country's independence, which essentially has no direct connection with the events that are currently taking place. On the other hand, our current events and the overall disgust that many Americans have toward our government, have to in some regard make you want to question, just what it is we are celebrating. That we're assholes and arrogant bastards? Well, we've always been that, but now there is true and "real" hatred towards us. And many of us think, rightly so.   I'm damn proud to be an American. Unfortunately, I'm not proud of many things that our government has, and is, doing. Celebrate? Yes, of course I will. (I never pass up an opportunity to drink beer!) However, I anticipate that many 4th of July parties will, and should, have something like a black cloud hovering over them. It would be utterly snotty of us to pretend, for even just one day, that everything in the country is perfect.   And unfortunately, by the looks of the people who were buying flags today, my gut is telling me that snotty ignorance will prevail this holiday. The "ignore all" attitude will only be exceeded by obnoxious patriotism. "WE'RE THE BEST FUCKING COUNTRY, DUDE. EVERYBODY ELSE CAN FUCK OFF!"  This mentality, I think, is not right.  It's on a day, such as the 4th of July, when we should all take a good hard look at our country. At our accomplishments, as well as our mistakes. We need to look at where we've been, and most of all, where we want to go. Be PROUD, but don't be ignorant.
