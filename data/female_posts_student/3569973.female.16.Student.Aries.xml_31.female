I gotta start gettin up earlier since school is starting soon. I cant believe that.  I cant WAIT until the CARNIVAL!! Then I laid around and waited for Jake to go get my movie for me. I cleaned up my room and watched 13 Going On 30, worked on some stuff and then took a shower.  I ironed my hair for the first time in about a month and did my make-up just because I was bored.  I used this new eye liner, but I just dont have the right eye shadow I think...but Im not for sure...I thought it looked good thought and my mom said she like it...then I came home and mom was like well now that I see it more, I dont think I like it that much. I was like oh well thanks whole bunches mom. Well then I went over to Jakes which he was 45min. late...I can not STAND IT when people are LATE!! I always have to be on time if not earlier, because to me when your late, thats showing the other person that your rude and that you think the world revolves around yourself instead of showing that you can be on schedule if you say thats when you'll be. I seriously can not stand it and I also cant stand it when people make last night plans...when they just up and say...oh yeah Im gonna be doing this and Im gonna be gone for so many days...and blah blah blah...I CAN NOT STAND IT!! OMG IT DRIVES ME CRAZY!! Well then after yelling at people, we went back to Jakes to make dinner and dessert and to watch 13 Going On 30. Then I almost ended up going to the hospital because like always we were wrestling and he picked me up and I tried to wiggle out and if I wouldnt have caught myself and if Jake wouldnt have been holding my legs I would have wacked my head on the bathroom floor. Then well...we messed up his entire room and he proved that yes "guys are stronger" so dont get caught in a situation where you cant get away, K.  lol. I came back here and watched the end of The Amazing Race, which I gotta watch later because mom recorded it for me. Then came in here to read this magazine and write in here like always, because its my new place to let things out I guess. Well I guess Im gonna check my mail and read my magazine. Till then, Later Days
