Actually it wasn't so much the cutting down part it was the lying. One lie after another about me. I can't believe him! ..Every single person that i know at the two apartment complexes were there to see the show. Even Bill but he was cool cuz he gave me some insight on why this is happening. And it all of this just has to happen the weekend before FCAT. Great! How can i relax now?..I have a huge knot in my stomach and i can't consentrate on even writting this. I wish everything would be okay. Drama in WV is NOTHING  like this. They called me a ho and came at me with these sticks while i was on a bike. I don't know why all of this happend. Oh and by the way David (the cause) pulled the fire alarm this morning. Everyones saying he didn't know it would go off! ya right...he knew exactly what that thing does.      Me and Thalia both need to calm down..I don't know what i'm gonna be doing tomarrow cuz usually i go to gabby's but...i guess im not going tomarrow. Everything was fine until tonight when Bill was feelingn weird. While Ralph was lying to gabby..Bill told me"Hey after all this is done we need to talk...theres a bad bad spirit around here i can feel it." I said ok and what does it do. He said"It causes problems and something bad is going to happen tonight." I guess he was right...I'm so mad im hungry. I can't believe this...I just wanna go back to everything that was good. Its so messed up right now.
