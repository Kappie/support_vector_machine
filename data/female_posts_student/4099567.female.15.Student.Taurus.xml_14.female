She freaked out when I took her out of her cage...she's not normally a sweetheart, but today, she was simply evil. She leaps around in my arms, digs her VERY long claws into my shoulder (I know have a very lovely gash there, thank you very much), bites my arm (where the skin broke), and hissed, flailing in every direction. Stupid bitch. I opened the open cage and chucked her in, screaming profanities at her. I look at the card on her cage and she was supposed to leave today. Who the hell names their demon "Peach"? Isn't that a cute and fuzzy name? Not a name for little piece of bratty fur. Hmpf.  Love always, April
