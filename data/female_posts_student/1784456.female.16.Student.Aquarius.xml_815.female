It's about this guy, who kills this guy so then he has to go and kill two more guys! Fun aye? Sounds good... well erm it was *cough* It said moderate violence and there was all this beating up and smashing skulls in going on! Not moderate to me! Well... I am a wimp! I was jumping all the way through though. Better go watch depressing Eastenders, it's sooo funny!
