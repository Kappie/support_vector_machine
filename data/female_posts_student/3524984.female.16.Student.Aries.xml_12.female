So so much! I hope that I will see ya more often since I am changing school's this year! You said we'd be friends forever! Keep that promise, I can't live without you. (I dont think anyone could.:D)::..  Anyway. *shrugs* Today, I had P.E. Dammit. We ran 600meters, then went on to the Long jumping. >.  >>Listens to H.I.M Funeral of Hearts It's really awesome. The words make me think. Like, after me and Benn broke up, I dont know how many times I listened to THAT song and just cried. (With Billy of course) He didn't cry as much as me. I dont recall him crying. I recall going shopping and buying some sweats at Roots. With him. Aww, he was with me...Pity Shopping. He bought me a charm bracelet that day too...He got me like four charms. The Irish flag, the french flag, a basketball and a volleyball. So sweet. Now I have a customized one that says Billy  Em BFF. Aww...;)  Another thing to consider...BFF...Best Friends Forever. I doubt it with some people who say it. But Billy and me ARE best friends. :S We shop together, we eat together, we cry together (in times of need) *duh*, he's like my best Gal friend. :D  Alot of noise here. Alex is playing Tony Hawk 4, I'm listening to H.I.M, the phone is ringing, I can hear James and Kaddie {friends of mine} practicing our new song, my mom is shouting at me...Hurrah, I'm talking to like 7 people online, and they are all talking at the same time...*doodleedee*! Arg! I'm trying to work here! *screams*  Nat is at soccer. I hope she won. That would be to awesome, then she could just shut up at school ;).   I took a magazine quiz today. It said I was to depressed for my age group... WTF. They said if they were my parents they would have me put on watch...*sighs* I'm, not going to kill myself. Look face it. I am not the suicidal "type" Well, I am but..I made a promise to Billy. So there. My mom is going nuts. She read my mag and was like, "Well, we should consider it" Whaaaaaaat? No. No. No. No. No! No attitude ajustment! Why me?! Why?!  I went out for some pizza with my friends.  >Jane >Krista >Julie >Lucie >Francois >Alex We were all supossed to go to the park after. But I wanted to go home. Lets start walking eh? Bah, Pizza was awful. Yuck. {Veggie for me :D} We all made GawdAwful drink mixtures. Like Ketshup and vinagire with diet 7up. I drank it. Ew. *vomits* Yuck!  I think I better start working on my NEW french project...*yay* >. ~S-em
