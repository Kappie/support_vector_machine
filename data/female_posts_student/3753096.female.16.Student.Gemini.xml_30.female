A pure feeling where I just felt like flopping on the floor and not  being  anything, just another piece of dust on my way to nowhere. It was peaceful, and the whole mood of the day ...it felt like it was waiting for something. The Cyrs came over for supper. Charlotte is sweet, and Christy manages to be fun but dignified. Michelle is so  real , so earthy, so tangible. And sooo funny. We walked to Ashlee's after, and she had us in stitches. Tomorrow I kind of hope the weather keeps up, and then Ashlee (with her artist's eye for detail) and I can go out, and I can take pictures. I have this urge to walk downtown and observe - right now picture taking feels like this rite I  must  accomplish. I feel removed from everything, like the world is behind a window and I'm outside looking in. I know it has to do with my wanting to take pictures, but I haven't quite figured out how.
