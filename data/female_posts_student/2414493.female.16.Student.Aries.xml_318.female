       
      Two minutes until midnight, and all I can think of is that it's really sticky and I need to shower tomorrow morning.   It's nice that I've constantly had something to do today.  After staying up late for  Shawshank  last night, we followed it up by boarding a bus to Brown at 9.I guess they decided to actually split us into groups this time by bus following the general chaos of the Yale trip, so I ended up on bus three with nobody I knew. But I think I learned weird lessons today. A good weird, since I wouldn't have learned them elsewhere.  Sitting in front of me on the bus were the two proctors, S and D. At first sight, S didn't seem like a typical Harvard girl, but as I accidentally listened to more and more of the conversation (hey, I honestly made a conscious effort to turn up the CD player so I couldn't hear them, but I started falling asleep and bits of their conversation drifted into my dreams. First thing: life isn't a breeze once you get into Harvard. On the contrary, it's brutal, and it's going to take some time to realize that you're not at the top of your class anymore.   I think that in itself is enough to deal with, chew on, ruminate for a while.  I've become too comfortable, really. To me, everything's just too simple and there's not enough work involved in getting to the top. It's the high school bubble. Even struggling for a thesis (which I cringe at every time I look back at it) is pain enough, so how does one deal with this kind of downgrading of the self with four classes a semester? Despite talks of grade inflation, I really don't think it's going to be that easy. I really should start enjoying high school more, since it's definitely not going to last.  The second point just freaks me out a bit--S has already set a wedding date for April 23, 2006. I'm assuming she's going to be a college senior next year. Still, it seems a bit weird to me. Here's someone who's still in school and already knows when she's getting married. The two just started talking about relationships, etc. Have we all run so short of time? What is this? I'm 16 right now and I really don't care sometimes.  As for Brown, it's nice, but it's not my top-choice school. I don't hate it at all, but I just don't see the attraction of paying Ivy tuition--after all, it  is  Brown--when I could be equally happier or better at Cal or something. Rhode Island is just really, really small. Apparently, you can pay $1.25 for bus fare and get  anywhere  in RI, which is insane--imagine doing that in California! The part of Providence that's close to Brown is very quaint, very bohemian. As usual, you have your Urban Outfitters and your Gap, but there's also some very strange shops that we walked into that smelled simply old and had handwritten signs, etc. The campus wasn't particularly impressive except for the Marcus Aurelius statue (see the picture) but then again, little can compare with the majesty (and don't refute me here!) of Harvard. Even their piddling little yard was nothing compared to here. Their bookstore was nothing like the Coop (though I only saw the first floor) and they sold random toys and gewgaws that had  nothing to do with Brown, so that kind of creeped me out abit. I  did  manage to get a remainder copy of  The French Lieutenant's Woman ,  though, which Mrs. B suggested. The only thing that made it sound better, though, was the tour given by the tour guides...they were just really upbeat, even though the campus isn't that impressive. Their 8-year med program only takes 60 students out of a pool of 1,300. Daunting.  We got back just in time to hear Ralph Nader speak in the Science Center. Well, part of it was Nader's speech. The beginning part was just local people speaking on behalf of their causes: anti-war, labor unions, the situation in Colombia (this one was interesting...I actually tried to listen to it in original Spanish). There was this one woman (girl?) who was dressed so informally I could have met her on the street and wouldn't have thought that this person was running for the Massachusetts state representative. She came up to speak in a tank top and a skirt, and I could see her flip-flopped foot with the toes pressing to the ground as she fidgeted at the podium. She's apparently running because nobody else is, but Jenn pointed out that she never talked about her platform...weird.  It was just really inspiring to hear Nader speak, though I will still not take a stand in politics. Kill me if you must, but that stuff just doesn't interest me. Perhaps it's another side effect of living in a bubble. He was very anti-capitalism...Zach called him a "watermelon:" green on the outside, red on the inside. I guess he made a point about not having to choose between the lesser of two evils (Kerry and Bush) but I didn't really get much out of it in terms of political ideology. I think I just went because I could snap pictures (I think Charlie mocks me for taking so many) and just be able to tell people that I saw Nader. That celebrity appeal. At the very end, one of his campaign workers came up to the podium and asked for a "hero" to donate $1,000, which struck me as very very weird. One guy gave $500 and another $100. So much for one cause? I guess either your money comes and goes very easily or you believe fervently in the cause. I just can't get over the fact that wow, this guy is constantly on national television and is the figurehead for the third-party opposition (again, don't yell at me if you disagree) but that was it. Just the sheer thrill. I felt bad for Dad during his anti-capitalist talks, and wondered to what I could credit much of my comfort...  And then dinner, and AIM, and  Kill Bill vol. 1  and here I am again. Though it's time to sign off since I'm getting tired--good night.  Then we came back and saw Ralph Nader speak in the science center, hence, the pictures.
