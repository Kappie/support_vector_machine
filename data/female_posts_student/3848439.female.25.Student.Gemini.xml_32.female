I never really had many beyond a few suicidal fish growing up.  But it was really nice having a creature around who liked me. The cat was a bit above oblivious to me, which I figure is good for a cat/person relationship.  I've wanted a dog for a while.  I prefer them to cats b/c I wish to be more than just a food source to the sucker.  I've been holding off on getting a dog because I want a large one.  Huge if possible - the size of a small car, perhaps.  But it'd be excessively cruel and really stupid to get one now as I live in a city in an apartment.  But I'm thinking.  Perhaps an older, smaller dog from a pound.  Nothing tiny and yippy.  But I really remember that Animal Society commerical from my youth, "Get an older dog.  They're cool!"  So perhaps I can look into it.  Of course, me being neurotic and all, I'm concerned that I'm just getting a dog to fight loneliness.  Perhaps I'm not truly called to have a furry pet beyond the potential vermin in the basement.  However, I think I can love a dog without luuuuving a dog.  But I'll look into it and let you all know.
