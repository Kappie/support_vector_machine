I just want you to know Father... That I've found a reason for me, To change who i used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you Lord.  I'm sorry tat I hurt you  That's something I've to live with everyday. And all the pain I put u thru I wish that I can take it all away.   And that's why i need u to hear Father, I found a reason for me, To change who I used to be A reason to start over new..and the reason is you Lord. Truly God...the only reason I live is because of you.  And to you who hurt me time and time again, You have a really disgusting habit. Empty promises that is. Why say all this to me only to break all your promises at the end of the day? Lying has became an integrated part of you. You lie like there's no tomorrow.  ice says: hahah .. no lah.. i will even call u when i there just like lassst time.. lol Me says: why must lol at the end of your msg? ice says: dunno.. cos u think i wun call u mah ..  Me says: can u do me a favour eh? ice says: what? ice says: why u copy and paste? Me says: can u rem tis? wat i copied n pasted ice says: yes...
