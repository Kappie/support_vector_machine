Like hell I can.  I should have just gone to the therapeutic community and been out of everyone’s way.  And I shouldn’t even be writing here, because ok you have the choice whether or not to read this, its not like I’m forcing you to listen to me, but on the other hand who on earth wants to listen to my waffle and crap? I mean its hardly exciting or seat-gripping stuff is it.  All you get is the pathetic, selfish out-pourings of my mouth.  The only thing is that I have nowhere else to put this.  I mean I could write like a paper blog right, but at least I have to be vaguely normal on here and can’t let me head go rampant like it does when I write. Used I am sort of safe here.  So what is my problem now? Well I reckon people are trying to say something to me  1.	The girl who cancelled the Cathy Burton thing and then again on Sunday  2.	Rachel hasn’t replied to my email I sent (and I know she has been online and picked it up) 3.	Have just found out that I may have to share a bed with Rachel when we go to Spring Harvest (I am doing a week of kids stuff and then am there as a guest with Rachel, Jon – her fiancée – and his youth group) which I DON’T want to do. I mean can you imagine anything worse than sharing a bed with someone who won’t even speak to you at the moment.   4.	Another girl who says she cares hasn’t been in touch for ages 5.	The fairtrade Easter egg disaster (which others say isn’t a disaster but they are not the one who screwed it up) 6.	Nothing which I REALLY want to happen, happens. Something always gets in the way – God supposedly has better plans – yeah right. 7.	and other stuff which I can’t say (see even though this place is supposed to be somewhere I can be really honest, I can’t because I have let certain people know about it. And although I could have not told anyone and then I could have written what I liked, there wouldn’t be much point because no-one would then read it. But then what is the point of anyone reading it anyway?????)    You see everyone keeps telling me that people will still like/love me, if I show them the real me. That they won’t run a mile.  But to the few people I have shown the real me (Rachel and Rachael) they have both left, walked away.  Its only a matter of time.  I was really proud of myself yesterday because I had been more real with people and for some reason it felt good. But now I am regretting it.  I shouldn’t have because although in the short term it may feel better, I know what will happen. After the initial period where they try and help me and want to be there for me, they get fed up, they aren’t able to cure or solve me, I take up too much time and effort, I’m not who they expected, what the wanted.  They can’t do it so they walk away. That’s what has always happened. That is what will continue to happen. When will I wake up and realise that?   It is impossible to turn me into a beautiful stone – there are no winds strong enough, no waves high enough (and believe me God has tried).   Failed project, mission incomplete, target unobtainable.
