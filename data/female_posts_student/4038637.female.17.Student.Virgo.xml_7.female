Forget the slander that you hear........ Before you can repeat it....... Forget each skight, each spite, each sneer....... Wherever you may meet it.........  Remember every kindness done to you.......... Whatever its measure............. Remember praise by others won........... And pass it on with pleasure............  Remember every promise made........... And keep it to the letter............. Remember those who leand you aid. And be grateful debtor..............  Remember all the happiness that.......... Came your way in living................. Forget each worry and distress............. Be hopeful and forgiving..............  Remember good, remember truth.............. Remember heaven's above you........... And you will find through age and youth......... That many hearts will love you.........  Keep on smiling... Make the whole world as happy as you are. Good Luck.......
