Listening to:   NPR...trying to win the heart of Mo Rocca.    Watching:   The vile, allergy-inducing tufts of cotton floating in the air.    Mood:   Like a cat napping in a patch of sunlight.   Hee. I just tried to set my radio to NPR, and I accidently put it on an Evangelist Christian station, and didn't realize it until after 10 minutes of listening to it.   Sometimes, I find that my leg positioned in such a way where it looks like I am an amputee. Other times, it seems like my extremities really aren't apart of my body. This leads me to imagine that my body is like a giant robot with a very little person sitting behind a large control panel, executing her will. Just something to think about...
