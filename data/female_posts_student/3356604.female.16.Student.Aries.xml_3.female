That's ok, I can wait...but I think this is the first time that I really am excited about going to BATS rehearsal. -goofy grin- Something interesting happened today, and yes I am going to talk about it. A boy I met a month or so ago messaged me on my mobile asking me to lunch on Sunday. Unfortunately, my love life is otherwise directed currently, so I declined as nicely as possible. This guy, Phil, I have met once and after vigorous texting on his part it seemed to me, and no doubt to him, that something might happen. However, he didn't ring or anything, and I told him I didn't really want to just text and chat on the net, and that I wanted a more realistic relationship. After that, I didn't really hear from him. After past experiences, I have decided that if I have to work too hard to win someone's affection, or to get their attention, it's not worth it and I'm just wasting my time. I informed him, anyway, that I was with someone else and thankyou for inviting me. I didn't even know the guy, and I think I'm much better off at the moment. Oh, before I forget, I was in my Biology exam with about 10 minutes left, when our Biology teacher walked in and started distributing homework he wanted us to do during the holidays. I was astounded. The other kids in my class and I started laughing at the absurdity of it. I mean really, that is taking homework WAY too far.
