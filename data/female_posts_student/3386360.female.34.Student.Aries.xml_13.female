Because of the health issues that I have now that I didnt have before or at least were NOT detected until now. I have no idea what my colesteral is that panel was done today. I will find out. I do have Diabetis (sp) which no one knew about until now, or rather no one bothered to inform me of until now. She is hoping we caught it in time and with weight loss we can get it under control. I am also on an asprin regement due to my heart, blood pressure medication (with a water pill added into it) and thyroid medication. I was expecting that. She also has me on a medication for something with the diabetic thing. So all in all it wasnt bad news. It wasnt the best ether but.. (smile) at least we are getting things taken care of. She is a great lady and I am so glad that I found her. She is awesome. I cant say it enough.   Ok now that the news is over and things are going to be ok I know i will be fine. I am now on 4 medications (including the asprin) but I can manage. To say the least I am / was scared to death when she said Dibetic. She wants me to lower my caffine intake. Ok I can do that. She wants me to start a good exercise regement. Ok I can do that. Once TOny finds out he will make sure I do what i need to do. She said that my eating habits are ok. She wishes I would eat better but she said that will take time to overcome the mental problem (ie. fear of getting heavy)  She did say that even though it was life threatening we did catch things in time. She is concerned that I dont know what my colesteral is but that will be ok I know it in my heart. Things will be good.
