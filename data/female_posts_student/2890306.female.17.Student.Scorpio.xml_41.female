Instead, I will make awards for the blogs I have grown attached to this year.  Fear not if you do not win for the awards will be held again next year.  It doesn't not mean I don't hold you close to my heart (or so you think...bwahaha).  So insert your name _______ right there and feel loved now, if you don't win later.  Stay tuned tomorrow for the categories and (possibly) awards!    Good night, America.  Yes, that includes you, _______ (insert name written above).
