Or maybe the girl is a TOTAL flop and can't decide what to think about. It is a rather saddening experience, let me assure you.  So you might have guessed what is wrong with me.  I'm thinking too much.  In fact, WAY TOOO MUCH. I mean, there are only a few things in life that are my constant, and I'm just not sure about them anymore. I suppose that maybe I can do something about it. Something to make me not to be such a shallow person.  But then again, does a shallow person care so much? I don't know.
