I felt like crap, (having spent the last two days packing non-stop) but i wanted to say bye to my friend so off i went. We had to walk (my P.O.S. car's battery was dead and Jenna's car? obsolete) . . . Jenna met us halfway, her adorable kid Jo-Jo bouncing along in his stroller . . . Off we went to play at the park . . . it was about eight o'clock and getting dark fast . . . all the more fun to swing . . . We played for about thirty minutes, by then it was full fledged night . . . Suddenly my sis noticed the sprinklers were on at the baseball field. They were huge sprinklers that shot water 100 feet into the air.   "Wouldn't it be great to sneak in?" Kimmi mused,   "Let's do it!" i said. Jo-Jo knew what was going on . . . he was already pulling off his little shoes . . . We arrived with aspirations to climb the fence (we'd already done this a couple of weeks ago when the pool was closed at our apartment complex, it wasn't a good experience) but to our surprise the gate swung wide open . . . we wasted no time. Running, the wet, new grass cool beneath our bare feet, we jumped and played . . . I couldn't play for long because i began to notice something . . .   The lights were on full blast at the soft ball field beside us and the sillouettes of Jenna, Kimmi, and Jo-Jo playing in the water were so beautiful . . . The water swinging off the ends of their hair, their bodies, black against the light, twirling and slinging sparkling sprays. "Why are you just standing around?" My sister asked. I told them what i was thinking. They just splashed me with water and my sister gave me a big, wet bear hug. "Gee, thanks." i said.   It was then that we all noticed something. Looking into the sprinklers with our backs to the light we saw the most glorious display of color. Rainbows. I counted twelve of them overlapping one another, and they weren't really bows, but rings of color . . . and when the sprinklers moved and the waters fell, they faded away slowlyso that we had to follow the sprinklers to see them.   i've never seen anything so glorious as the intertwined colors of twelve rainbow rings against a black sky . . . We were all getting thirsty, so i asked one of the kids peeping over the fence at us if the concession stand was open . . . since it was my bright idea and i was the only one not wearing a white t-shirt i was voted to buy the drinks . . .   We took our cokes to the inside of the stadium, then stood on the dug-out singing and dancing until we were so exhausted that we had to go home . .. my sis walked with Jenna (she was spending th enight with her), and i walked home alone . . .   It was a beautiful night . . .
