LJ (Live Journal) does not give users enough customization, with only a few ways to change and tweak the template. Xanga is extremely popular for its "easy usage" reasons, but once again, to change stuff, it can be extremely annoying. Blogger is the only one left where you can actually get rid of the nasty ads on the top of the page, and allows full access to the template itself. You can even have several users and stuff.. I just think that's really cool. Anyway, my schedule appointment is tomorrow.. ahhhh.
