It just feels so good to actually know what's going on and to be able to be open about stuff. I hate letting things build up and then blow up, I'd rather just talk about everything honestly and openly then to hide it all and let it get old. So yeah, now I'm at my girl Amanda's house and we're gonna go watch a movie ... so yeah, more later! bye bye..goodnight MR. ngiyakuthanda. lol  ~BS
