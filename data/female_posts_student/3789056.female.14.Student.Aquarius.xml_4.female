But wats the point of getting worried when i don't have the mood to start working? my mother had been a good motivator to get me to work, but it was no use.( Mei yong de, Mei yong de) no use one. so wat am i going to do? by the way, Diana's table was kicked today. I dunno who did it but i have a feeling that tells me its zhenling. She has been asking who is that"sucker"to write nasty things about her in her blog today. This whole thing is so irritating. By the way, the math relief teacher is a **. Starts lesson the moment she steps into the classroom.And keeps giving us work to do. I should be real busy, but i dun seem to. Just keep watching tv and going online.Well, I don't think thiskind of life suits me but it seems to me that i am tired and listless all day and time is passing o quickly!
