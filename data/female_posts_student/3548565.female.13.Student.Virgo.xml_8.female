Lynn ate it too and now she has a stomachache too. =/ Please don't tell me it was the food we ate. =P Cos that is, like, my favourite dish at that place and now it's upsetting my stomach. Lolz, maybe I should stay off that dish for a while. =( Oh well.. what more can be done? I'll probably end up going to the toilet neways, which, um..I'm actually hoping I will NOT need any time soon. =/ --Fluffles--
