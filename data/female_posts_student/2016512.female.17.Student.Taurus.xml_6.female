I'm sure there are at least a dozen factual errors and who knows how many words I made up, but it's done.  And I even mentioned baseball once to appease Mr. Social Teacher's sports crazy mind.  But I'm done, and that is good... especially since it'is only 6:24pm... which is downright awesome!  I'm going to go eat spaghetti.  Enjoy yourselves.  The wood needs a-cording, Manda
