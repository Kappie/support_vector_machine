Generally, they say it's over as soon as you can't picture anything else in your mind.  But I don't know them and they don't know you.  So, I'll take you anyway.  Between the floor boards, moonlight twines with dust creating a froth that would be beautiful if I cared.  It seems that life is nothing until you meet someone you care about.   And I won't die like this again.  I won't tell you, or them. Because I don't trust you, or them.  I'm quite through with being open.   One man told me many times, that loving was nothing but a weakness and I knew he was bitter, so why listen? Well, listen now, my little children, my little cubs, he was right, and I'm not doing it anymore.  I'm simply cutting it off, the way I was supposed to before;  queens can't have liabilities.     [liberation.]   I know you're tired now, but there's no need to worry; we aren't going to be (anything) much longer, because you've decided for us and we're going to die.  And as I lay across from you, dust brushing the inside of my eyelids, (because how am I to maintain that beautiful blue in death?) sigh in contentment; you don't have to struggle anymore.  Vines twist into our bodies puncturing our hearts, wrapping around our lungs and don't you dare cry out, because this is what you wanted; your freedom, your liberation.   our skin decays, slips of softness blackening to moist petals; and they rain, swaying as the breeze stirs them; they fall.  our tongues shrivel, cherry wedges curling in upon themselves before drying, maturely ripened and ready to beplucked.  our bodies decompose; sweet sweat a peeling finish, hair a frothy crown,and forgotten vows a mocking murmur.  we die, beautiful and calm in the idiocy of a release that's nothing but a beginning to what you thought life mimicked (hell).   we died, side by side and we are still so alone.  we're dead, and I suppose that it really doesn't matter if you loved me or not, 'cause now I have Satan to love me and his kisses burn even more than yours.
