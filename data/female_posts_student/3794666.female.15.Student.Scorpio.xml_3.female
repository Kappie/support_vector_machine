Well anyway, I am not sure what I am going to talk about in this blog, but I am afriad to a say anything out lound. I fear that people might think that i am a mental case or something. Which you know would not be a very bad idea, it's better being a mental case that plan old normal. Then there is love, I told myself so many times before that it wouldn't happen to me, that I wouldn't let it happen to me. At least not until college, but unfortunately it has happened. I wont tell you who it is. But this person is very special, and it may not be who some of you might think. I guess I have been hit by the love bug. This person will never like me, I guess I have always known that. But I have always thought that maybe that person would make a move. But i guess I was wrong. I will always be that person who gets left out, like always. I mean i have friends in probably all of "social groups" in school, but as soon as those friends get together in their owngroups, they pretend that they were never my friend. It always works that way. I guess there must be something wrong with me. So what do I do. Joelle told me i analyze things way to much, but I don't think I do. I am afriad she just doesn't understand, because has never been in this situation. WellI don't know, maybe I do. Ok then, well i guess thats enough for now.
