I was at Mr. Bill's new house which is huge (5,600 sq. ft. to be exact) to watch Kenny and Jillian while he and Marty and Jared moved stuff from old house to new house. No lie, the house has a basement which is like 1,300 sq. ft. all by itself. Anyway I was there til like 5 and it was cool cuz I got to talk to Reba about how worried we are about what's gonna' go down once Barbara's on maternity leave. You can never really tell with my church. We all flirt, that's normal, and no joke, just about everyone has dated someone within the youth group, and even though that's cool and all, we're just a lil worried about what's gonna' happen once barbara's gone b/c she's the strict one. Can you say, watch out for ski trip, 05'? haha reba. Also, i found out that Amez had to close down her live journal b/c she got bitched at for writing stuff in it about our youth group. News flash people, you don't have to read it. We write in journals because it's an outlet. So, they happen to beonline and you're more than welcome to read them, but if you have un problema, keep it to yourself. That's about all I have to say on the subject. So tonight me and amez and magee went to see Bourne and it was an awsome movie (which is a plus since we only went to see the hot guy). Well we arrived at the theatre at 7:45 and the movie started at 8:00. well they were sold out. SOOOO we bought tickets for hte 9:45 showing and ate at Atlanta Bread. It was pretty good. We talked about youth group and how we love/hate it. Good times. Then we walked down to Goody's and walked around in there for awhile and then we walked back. I'm pretty sure we looked like hookers on the street (rather I did) but that's ok. Then we saw the movie. Good movie, go see it. Anywho, tomorrow i'm gonna' be a lector at church for the first time ever. This is kinda' scary considering i can't pronounce like half of the words. It'll be ok though b/c steven the PIMP will be laughing at me in the congregation. haha- Liz
