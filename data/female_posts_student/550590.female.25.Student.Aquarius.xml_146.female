The good news is that with all the dust flying around, I'll probably get a sinus infection and will be able to use some of the 150 HOURS of sick time I have saved up that I'm not going to get paid for when I leave.  With Bruce in South Florida to visit his parents, I have less excuses to put off packing. Unfortunately, I've run out of boxes and I'm now resorting to packing things I can fit in bags and suticases. But hey, at least the Superstation is playing Predator again!
