Unfortunately, it also marked the return of the severe pain that accompanied the tearing of my retina and the month of uncertainty as I was unable to see with such a low IOP (c. zero to seven).    Been busy reading Psych today.  So far so good; I have covered romantic and companionate love, parenting, aggression and altruism.  I'm heading into emotions but might have to leave that until tomorrow.  More to come...
