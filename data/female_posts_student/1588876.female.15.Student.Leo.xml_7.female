Father Robert Barricks (Holy Family Church Priest. has criticized MANY families of not being christian) Holy Family Catholic School Principal, Ms. Lockie (i never really cared what the fuck her first name was) Ms. Sandy Jacobs (7th grade teacher) Ms. Anne McCarty (8th grade teacher. lives too close to me for comfort) and finally, Kelsey Giachinno (accuser. liar. bitch. demon seed. sock puppet look-alike) -all of the preceeding may burn in hell for what they have done to many families  kudos and cheers to all of my friends who supported me through the hard times i had to overcome during the lies and cruelty. also, to the victims of kelsey's lies and Fr. Bob's accusations and condemning.
