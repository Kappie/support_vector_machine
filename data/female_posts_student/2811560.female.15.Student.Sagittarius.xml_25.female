But the other one sucked pretty bad. I guess it was like a pre-act test or something crazy like that. Heres a sample question: "How many squares would have a numerically greater perimeter than area of any other squares, in square inches?" When I got to the question, I just started laughing. I don't think that was the exact question though. Something similar. I'm sure they used the word square at least 3 more times. Are they trying to tell me something? I know I'm white and all, but man! And then we had to look at these pictures of turtles and robots and decide whether they were the same or different. And they were all the same! It was really bizarre. We didn't get any breaks in the three hours that we were there either. So Jeff Woz and I are going to Westfield after school today to see everyone. I'm excited, it should be entertaining. And then I have voice lessons, which is definitely a good thing considering I got bitched out by Ms. Gibson last week for not knowing the notes for my IHSA duet with Laura Waters. Grr, I was so pissed after that, someone almost had to physically restrain me. And I'm not a violent person. Oh well, I'm over it now. Also, I'm going to see this play tonight at Drury Lane called "A Man Came to Dinner" or something crazy like that. My Mom got free tickets through her work so I thought I might as well go. I think that's it...tootles!
