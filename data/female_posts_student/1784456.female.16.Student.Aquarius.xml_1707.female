Pigeons are penguins. now b4 u go 'shes off her trolley again' i am not i merely sed the wrong thing at wrk. i was sat at the front of the shop minding my own business, there was a stupid dog tied to a tree and some pigeons eating a biscuit. the dog starts barking at the pigeons, debbie asks wot the racket is, adn me being me i shouted back 'dont worry its jst some silly dog barking at the penguins!' trust me, bloody typical. my nu fone still hasnt been dispatched but kes i will email everyone wen my nu number comes and then it is up to u 2 put it in ur fone if u want it. cos i f u dnt and u txt my old fone u will get my mum or my dad, *and that does mean going and sending txts to my parents 'by mistake' sayiing things like 'u no that guy u like' or woteva*. I got paid yesterday! but they put tax on it when they arent supposed to but we r gonna claim back wot they took off which means i will get £248.something!!!!!!! to add to the £532 that i already have, but £248 is 2 1/2 months wages, more or less. hmmmmm.................................need to talk to anna and samantha bt s is round dans and i dnt no where anna is and i dnt hv ne cred on my fne! o well xxx
