I think, as Ron Weasley put it, it's the way they move. It all started when I was a young child in my grandmother's Columbia City residence. My dear cousin Britney, four years older than I, was a theatrical sort and one of my greatest influences growing up. I think this is where I learned to overdramatize practically everything. Anyway, there was a box of puppets she had brought over from her church, and we adored putting on puppet shows for our bored relatives.   Or at least, she did. She was normally all the voices. And characters. I just kind of sat and watched.   But there was one puppet she always threatened me with, whenever I did not pander to her every whim.   A large, black, fuzzy, long legged, many-eyed spider.   She waved it in my face and made hungry noises. I would scream and cry hysterically and leave the room and/or do whatever she wanted.   One time she locked me in her parents' master bedroom. She wouldn't let me out, either.  HORSES: I used to love these lovely creatures, until I went to Camp Logan and had a horse named Tucker. This horse seemed determined to give me a hard time. It stopped to pee, crap, eat, just stop for the hell of it, and buck at me, and try to throw me off, and walk the wrong way.  It was not fun.   This is the most likely reason why I detest these creatures today. Other than those damn pink unicorns.  GOATS!: I was about six when one of these brats climbed into MY red wagon and sat down and wouldn't move its ass. It took my father and a zoo keeper ten minutes at least to get the damn thing OUT!   Another thing that annoys me is the fact that every time I climb into that place one starts chewing on my shirt. I don't know if I spilled something on it, or I smell good/bad, or WHAT. But it's inevitable and I can't stand them. So there.  Yes, I went to the Zoo today. And it was cold.   Hmmm.  I intend to start a new page on my website.... it's a campaign idea of mine. You might want to check it out later in the day.  *sigh*
