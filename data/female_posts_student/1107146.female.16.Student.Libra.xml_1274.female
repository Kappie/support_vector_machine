Here's what I'm thinking.    Who: In reverse alphabetical order by first name, because I've always  hated  the whole school system of things, here's who's coming: Will, Rosie,  Lindsey, Josh, Elizabeth, Abby.  Feel free to invite other people, as  long  as I know them and like them. i.e. not Becca, any of Becca's  counterparts,  or anyone else obnoxious like Jared or Lumley, but God knows there's  more  where they came from.  I'm thinking, Philip or Jacob or Julian  (heehee),  people from our study hall would be good to invite. What: Birthday Party for Josh and Will When: Saturday May 17, 2003 at 5ish-10ish (I'll confirm those tomorrow) Where: Lindsey's house, probably basement Why: Josh and Will are turning sixteen   Bring: Your own snack/munchie/food...whatever   I will confirm all but the obvious tomorrow. -El Presidente  Oh yeah...I'm not going. If Becca isn't going and I'm not and Phil could go see a movie with....yeah......he's not going to be there. Sorry all.  Bye Bye
