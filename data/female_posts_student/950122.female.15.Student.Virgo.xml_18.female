Lalala... I'm quite bored. Let's just try to remember what I was feeling for the past three or so days.    Let's see... April 4!       April 4, 2003     My brother graduated high schoool today. I'm reluctant to say it, but I guess I'm a bit jealous of him. Most of the time I'm used to getting all the attention in the house, now everyone's concentrating on Jeth. Recognition Day, Graduation Day, Graduation Prom... I dunno. I'm just not used to it. I guess I'm pretty selfish huh? Weird to think. Goody-two-shoes me is not so angelic. But then again, who said I was angelic in the first place? n_n;;       April 5, 2003     Stephan is here. He's my cousin from my dad's side. He's from Austria, and can speak fluent German. Crystal and I had fun having him translate some phrases for us [Mostly Crystal; she was in a questionable state], like 'Fuck the truth', 'You suck!' and 'Shit!'. I still remember some of them. Haha. I wonder if I'll  actually  end up using them.    Crystal [my 17 year old aunt] and I were lying down on my top bunk doing nothing. We were talking about how we really didn't have anything to do, but the topic just led us to that; doing nothing. So we just stayed there, staring at the ceiling. Then Crystal asked me, "Ria, what's the meaning of our lives??" in a very subtle manner. I replied, "Gosh Crystal, are we really  that  bored?"    But that just brings me to why I don't like having nothing to do. It's not that I dislike not having anything to do because I don't have anything to do, but it makes me think of things I don't want to think about because there really is nothing else to do. [I hope you got that. n_n;;]    For some reason, I don't feel as if Jeth has already graduated. It's like I've always had to be the big sister to him, and he's off to college!    Gosh, the house will be so empty once he leaves.       April 7, 2003     I can't really remember anything that happened yesterday, so I'll just post about today. Stephan has gone back to Uncle Teddy's place, where he first started. Crystal is leaving tomorrow, so basically I'll be pretty alone in this house since Jeth locks himself up in his room all day long. Really, I don't want to be alone. It's makes me think too much. I remember this time during sophomore year, I was supposed to organize my group in cooking as the next day we would be cooking/baking something. [I forget.] I was sitting on the couch upstairs SMSing everyone, then I had to wait for their replies. I started to think too much during my wait, and I had to leave the organizing up to Mikara.    Hmmmmmmmmmmm. Here I go again. I'm starting to think too much. I don't want to be alone. Jeth is leaving, Crystal is leaving... I mean, even if Jeth holes himself up in his room, I still know he's  there . But in June, he'll be gone...      Schaisse!     I'm thinking too much again.    P.S--> I did end up using the German words Stephan taught me.
