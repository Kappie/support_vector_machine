First, the bad - I lost my mom’s GENUINE pearl earring.  Brittnay (Brittany B. for all those outside yearbook) has the other one in her pocket.  Well, I’ll use one of the good things that happened today to take care of that.  Second, my mom found out about my interim.  America, if my mom’s reaction were a bomb explosion, we would be experiencing nuclear fallout in Hiroshima right now.  And that’s the reaction I got because she thinks my math analysis grade is a D.  I believe human life would cease to exist if she knew I was failing.  The third: I just accidentally deleted all my computer games and my computer calculator, AND my painting tools.  This is a tragedy almost incurable by the three good things that happened today - Quill and Scroll, Shoney’s and something between me n sum1 else that’s almost better than the first two combined.  Suppose you’re wondering…why Shoney’s?  Well, I got a job there, after two months of searching.  I’m starting Monday as a hostess and cashier.  Even if the wage is $5.15 an hour, and I work two weekend shifts, I will still get $103 (before taxes…after it’s about $61.80) every two weeks.  That’s mostly going towards replacement earrings for my mom (I cannot fathom her reaction to two blows within one weekend).   Well, Jay’s opening monologue’s coming up in a few minutes, so I’ll keep it short.  I’m lovin a host of songs, like: -I miss you - Blink-182 -Love’s divine - Seal -Touched by an angel - Celine Dion (“Let the rain come down and wash away my tears”) -Leave (Get out) - Jo Jo -Take my breath away - Jessica Simpson -Extraordinary - Liz Phair -My band - D12 -Dirt off your shoulder - Jay-Z (the Edwin renditions in Math Analysis don‘t count lol) -My immortal - Evanescence (yes, I still love it, mostly because of Friends) -The reason - Hoobastank One more thing I forgot to add to my bad and good list.  The bad - I saved my semi-final draft on my computer, and it lost my draft this morning.  I had to take my first tardy since first grade to retype it.  The good - I took it to Boswell, and she said that if I make the changes that she suggests, I should have an A, and that it’s 100 times better than it was before.  I still want one of the best freakin editors to look over it though, cause the comments were really, really helpful.   Did you know that, now, you can comment on my blog entries?  I was reading Shaheen's blog and discovered this.  Of course, eblogger will not be perfected until it has a counter and a list of screen names that visit.  Imagine the fun...do I hear an evil plan Dominique? Sorry, but between my cat’s fear of fans (u have no idea what fun it is to blow it on her and see her reaction) and Jay, le blog can’t compete.  I’ll leave you with a few quips from Jay (these may not be word for word):  “You don’t read the newspapers, you don’t know what’s going on in the world.  It’s like being President Bush [in reference to being in Las Vegas.” -Jay Leno “John Kerry once went to a concert with Courtney Love.  And he’s questioning Bush’s judgement?” -Jay Leno “According to Michael Jackson, he wants Janet Jackson to marry at Neverland Ranch.  The only people who have objections, in fact, are the parents of the ring bearer.” -Jay Leno
