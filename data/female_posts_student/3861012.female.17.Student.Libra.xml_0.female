But she has been pretty good with those things lately. I'm really bad at losing track of time, or ignoring it, lately. It's kinda a bad habit to get into.   Well so far this morning I haven't done much. I feel bad about yesterday, maybe I did over reached a little to Jen's comment in Elle's blog but that's just part of who I am.
