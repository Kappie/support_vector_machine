I don't think I've wanted anything more than this. Yettagain I sound like a whore. I don't speak my emotions too well, I guess.  Anyways. I had a thought today. When we were kids, we thought our parents were the most innocent people in the world and we wanted to be like them. Or something like that anyway.. And then as you grow older you can see more of the corruption.  I truly wish my father would go away. I don't think I've ever felt so bad about it, but it's true, and there's no lieing about it. You don't say things like that if you don't mean them. Anyway, the wind blows.. Stef.
