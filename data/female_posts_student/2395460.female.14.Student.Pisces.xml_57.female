A  urlLink five-country study of gender issues in IT  has concluded that women don't go into technology fields because they don't want to be seen as socially misfit geeks. Many of the women in the study said they felt that the technology career path was dominated by men and they felt unwelcome in the field. This is understandable but the study's conclusion baffles me. Women feel unwelcome in a world dominated by men, but really, they don't go to work in the tech industry because it's  just not cool . The study had a noble goal- to try and figure out why there was such a huge gender gap, but it seems to have delved about an inch deep into the matter.  I think I'll stop reading and go back to my basement with my 80 computers and my XBox. Thank goodness I don't have any friends to keep me from my all-day, all-night gaming and coding.
