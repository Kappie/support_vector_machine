Yay! I'm still smiling about it ^-^. But that kinda got ruined by my damn science project! Arrgh took me Saturday  and  Sunday to do it! Well, then again, I saw the 3rd Harry Potter movie on Saturday night so that kinda evened it out '^-^. Oh and I'm dancing today at lunch! Infront of the whole school! Ahhh I'm going to sooo mess up! Oh well, doesn't really matter since I'm in the  very  back row! Grr...I'm so topsy-turvy now, but I think this is my way of making things better for myself. I'm starting to see the glass as half full is what they say. I still think I'm somewhere in the middle, like the glass is half empty and half full. Sometimes in my life, it's fuller and sometimes it's more empty, just depends on my day. Everything's chocked full of ups and downs, you just gotta deal with it in your own way I guess. Events happen for a reason, whether you like it or know why they're happening. No one can predict what hurdles you may have to face in the near-future, and it will always remain this way. Destiny doesn't find you, you work your way towards it. I sound like a philosopher or something, don't I? Heh...I'm so weird sometimes...
