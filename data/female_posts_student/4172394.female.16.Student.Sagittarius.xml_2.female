Soccer       Yup, the news that all Liverpool fans that are talking about. Owen leaving Liverpool for Real Madrid. It does come like a shock, coz all seems well about him signing a new contract. Then the signs appears, he didn't played for the CL qualifer. And wham, Owen is leaving fot Real Madrid. Well, to be honest I didn't really feel sad, feel that Gerrard is more impt than him. But I do think is silly of Owen to go Real, when they have so many gd strikers. Like Raul, Ronaldo, Morenities. When will it be his turn? (sigh)      Anyway, Liverpool kicked off the season by drawing with Spurs. I thought is a match they should win. Well, is gd that Cisse scored on his debut EPL match. But didn't understand why Benitez took him off and later Baros off too. Denfensive, to hold on to the 1 goal lead? Anyway it backed fired, when Defoe equalised.      And the match everyone is concerned about. Chelsea vs Man Utd. Everyone seems to going for Chelsea. But I think Man Utd might pull off a draw....          Olympics     Well, is mainly the heats on the 1st day of Olympics. But there was the 400m freeystyle final. For a moment, I thought Ian Thorpe is going to lose to his countryman. But he edged out to grab the gold. Sure, it wasn't near his own WR, but is still a gold medal. Moving on to 400 IM, Michael Phelps broke his WR and won the gold. It was a easy win, no strong contenders. It will be interesting day at the pool, as Phelps vs Thorpe in the 200m free.(which Thrope is the WR holder) I think Thorpe is going to win it, crushing Phelps hope for matching Spitez's 7 gold medal haul. Very interesting, indeed....
