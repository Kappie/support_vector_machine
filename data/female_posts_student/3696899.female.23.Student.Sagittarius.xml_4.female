I dont know when I am going to pick it up, it should be sometime around the 4th.  Dad is doing better I guess, he is out of the hospital and was caught making a drink on last Sunday.  So the stress isnt gone yet.  Mandy I think the exercise will work, just keep at it. Paul when you give me a chance let me know what you website is called. Talk to you later, see ya.
