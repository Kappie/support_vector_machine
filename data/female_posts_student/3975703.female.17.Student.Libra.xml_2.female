S after that, I sat around and at 11 I finally decided to get ready for practice which started at 1:30. I got to practice 15 minutes early and hung out with some peeps. Then from there we worked with the orchestra     which took FOREVER! Wefinally got out of there at 5 and then I came over to my cousins house until I figure out what is going on later. So as of now I just got back from getting a slurpee and taking a walk with my wonderful cousin Amber. She is just great. Can't you tell I am in a strange mood? Yea. So I think that Josh needs to get back from Cadillac REALLY soon. I miss the kid! But anyway, I am going to go.. peace and hair grease!                  Come see   The Pirates of Penzance                 Aug 4th thru 7th            Be there                              Tami
