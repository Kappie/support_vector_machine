We (Me, Nathaniel, Katie and Lindsay) also came up with "Manual Car Dance" today at lunch.....ask me to do it for you and i will because its funny!  I also remembered Lindsay's slogan for my life story.....'So Many Hockey Players, So Little Time!: The Taylor Mercer Story'......LOL its soo true!!!  By the way, i bought Miracle today and with that dvd, i got this other cool documentary dvd on the real 1980 hockey team, its pretty cool!  I also got the Miracle soundstrack which is AWESOME!!!  Everyone needs to watch the outtakes on their Miracle dvd, they're so funny!!  Dave Silk's outtake is the best!    Today i had more things to tell my Senior buddies before they graduate like: * telling Katie that she's the funniest person i've ever met * Telling Jimmy that i absolutely love his voice and i'm going to miss him soo much! (I revealed to him yesterday that i had a crush on him this year for 2 months and he admitted that he thought i was attractive!:-D!!!!) * telling Kevin that his shoes didn't match his outfit on our date that we went on earlier in the year that kinda....died lol * telling Kevin that i'm going to miss him terribly!  Things i still need to tell my senior buddies: * Tom - that i'm going to miss him and he the funniest guy i've ever met * Cavanaugh (John) - that i love him forever and thanks for not rubbing it too bad that the stars didn't make it past the first round or the fact that we sucked this year * Josh - alright so me and him aren't tight or anything, but he needs to know that i had a crush on him last year for about a month  soooo....i'm just watching Vinny kick the ass of the Philly Flyers....haha your team sucks Britty!!!!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
