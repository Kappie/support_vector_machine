I was a growth...a cancerous one. I felt like a pain in the ass and I hate feeling that way. It's not anyone's fault. It's probably a good thing I was forced to feelthat way. Sarah has endured her fair share of that through the years. But honestly, I hope certain people don't hate me. I know Sarah doesn't...I think. I don't want them to think I'm just a lemming who follows people around. I'm not that kind of person at all. That's enough of me trying to justify myself. I didn't know what was to come, if I would have....just, trust me.
