They brought it not only to the building but up to the front door of my apartment and then up the stairs inside my front door to the main floor of the condo.  I didn't have to carry any of my bags upstairs at all!  The guy was really nice and I got coupons for $5 off my next four purchases!  I love it!  Everyone should use Peapod:  urlLink Everyone should have their grocers delivered!
