Like something is making me think about it. I feel weird. I feel like..i want this. Jeez im so messed up lol. First day back to school...it was alright but i'd rather be outside and being able to see *someone*   I didn't listen to any of my classes even though they seemed interesting. I was too drained from yesterday.  So anyway...i guess i'll post later but oh well..thats all for now. bye
