I was a little disturbed when I realized how much of the soda you imbibe when you slurp up fuzz.  It feels like nothing, but half the glass is gone when its all over.    What are the metaphors that I use to look at my life? I tend to think that Joseph Campbell is the bomb, and that the myths of our world do repeat themselves over and over again.  Maybe I look at myself as the hero, or maybe I look at myself as the villain.  Maybe I am both, all the characters really, and I am making the story as I go.  Each test making me stronger, building up to what?  In the myth the hero gets to go home at the end, live happily ever after, be done.  In that case, is death going home?  Are there hero's that run away?  That flee from the dragon, and run from the ogre, and still get the prize in the end?  What are my ogres, who are my dragons?  I think that I also use the metaphor of text to examine my life.  The world is a text, and each thing has meaning if it is brought into focus.  In a novel, if the author spends a crazy amount of time on the description of the butterfly, you could assume that they meant it to have meaning.  I think that the meaning comes from your own context, from the cultural context from which you observe the butterfly, but the meaning is there.  Is it then possible that the author and the reader bring meaning to the text?  That the author uses words, format, conventions, timing, novelty, displacement, to bring to light a meaning that they are trying to convey?  And that in doing that, the reader is more focused towards that meaning, but still is interpreting the personal truth in their own context and life.  All this battle between reader response and expressivism, seems silly.  I think that we are entering a new age.  I think that it is new, because I have never heard of a similar age in history, though there could be one.  It seems, that everything that I learn about the past went from fact to questions, to a new fact.  Reality became more and more static.  Now, I heard whispers and thoughts and theories about a new way to move through thought.  Maybe, just is it possible, that it is a combination?  I litany of many truths?  Our post structuralists would claim there is no truth, that everything is so dependent, that meaning so fluid, that it is no truth and all truth- therefore no truth.  I would say that is bull shit.  There are things that can be truth, and they can seem like contradicting truths and still be truth.  There can be a god, and there can be science.  There can be light, and there can be dark, and there can be a hell of a lot of grey in between.  Why do we insist on a right and left world, when it clearly is neither?  Chaos or order, but both, intertwined, making things hella more fun.  I believe in this: magick and science and fate and coincidence and dreams and waking and winter and sadness and violence and peace.  All of it is here, in front of us and with us.  Is that a cop out?  Because I am not brave enough to believe that there is nothing?  In the middle.  All stories exist there.  Ours does too... In fractal theory we are all parts of the equation.  Universal patterns reflected in us over and over.  Can we know truth by looking at a tiny grain of sand or a word or a star or a mind?  This pattern, if there is a pattern, would fill everything.    I asked a friend, "so, if god created everything, and before god there was nothing but god, then everything must have been made from god, cause there was nothing before that but god and his will, and even if it isn't made out of gods left thigh, but his will, that is still god."  We were walking down a lush road, green and clear.  I was living in a T-P at the time I think.  "So," says I, "If I lay homage to this tree, am I not laying homage to god?  The same god that you do, but I call it tree and you call it Jesus?"  "No, she says, if this world is a painting, God is the painter, but the paint is not God."  "But then where did he get the damn paint?"  "He made it."  "Out of what?  It had to be out of him, because before that there was only him."  "Nope."  "What?" "No, he just painted it.  If you worship the painting and not the creator that's all wrong."  "No, go back to the paint, there had to be paint.  Molecules, and lights, and star dust, all had to come from somewhere.  I will buy that it came from god, or his will, but I will not buy that it is not him."  "Nope, its not."  Thus, why I cant be Christian, but do believe in the patterns, the pieces of divine creation and destruction in every breath and thought and mini iris.  Its in bloom by the way.  Delicate and rich purple, like breathing dream nights.  With white a yellow highlighting its delicate sex.  Yum.  I need to go meet Dylan, but one more quick thought.    I dreampt last night that I was being held against my will by a Columbian drug lord in Iowa.  This has happened before in the dream, so I knew what to do.  Don't go through the waterfall cave with the octopus spirit, do go down the rope first, jumping down the vegetated cliff, and carry a knife.  Ignore the fact that the rope is too short, you get down anyway, and know that you will be caught and forced to use the knife.  So despite the fact that I was in high heels I went first with the knife, going over the top of the waterfall, and down the lush hill.  At the bottom the a big thug was there.  I knew I would be homefree if I could get to civilization.  I tried to yell out a warning to my fellows at the top, and though my voice was feeble, my old dog Jane heard it and stood up.  Dylan pulled her down.  I stabbed the big man once, and recognized my savior walking up.  He is a very handsome Italian man that I have met in my dreams before, though he failed to recognize me.  I stabbed the big man again.  The knife only went in about an inch each time, but it was enough and he ran away.  In the zero degree ending that all dreams have I was flying on a plane, going home, watching as we flew over an iceberg and the sunset was making it glow orange.  On the side of the iceberg was a space shuttle landing and dropping under the water.  I pointed this out to my Italian companion, though he didn't see what was so conspiracy theory cool about it.  So I kissed him with the taste of honey on my lips and entered the waking world...
