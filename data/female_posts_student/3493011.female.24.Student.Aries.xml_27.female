Coz guess what we got a William Hung wanna be...I reckon for the programme you can either make it big time with quality or still make it big time by being the anti-hero...Flynn sang Jacko's "Beat it" and yah with the classic moves that he'd improvised.. it was hilarious but once again another disgrace for the millions of Chinese out there... It's sick to know that now whenever I step out, I'll be judge based on stereotypes.. Chinese oriental chick who's submissive yet really fuckable... well, such is life especially when western imperialism still exists...  Juz went to city to run some errands.. met my OCF frens but I'm slowly distancing myself frm them..since I've decided to move onz... but yah I still wanna be frens with these young kids... I know I'll miss them but yah perhaps occassionally I'll drop by... hmm.. nothing much for today.. will update on my meaningless life tomolo..ciao...
