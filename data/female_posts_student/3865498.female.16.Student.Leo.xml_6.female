Or Do you see That same girl But she's wicked hot And, in your own opinion, That's much better Than a girl who's Intelligent, Caring. Do looks really run the world? Do they really decide who's hot  Or not? Can morals And values Count for something in life Or are they too old-school To matter anymore Please If you want me only for my looks You better walk away Because I won't stand for a man Who tells me I'm hot everyday When I'd rather hear "The beauty inside Means the most to me." But how could someone ever say that When they dont get close enough To even scratch the surface Of my inner beauty. Something must be wrong in the world. If what's inside Doesn't matter anymore But I know someday Someday! I will meet a man who sees the whole me Freckles, big nose, and all And love me for the whole me Not just the superficial me.
