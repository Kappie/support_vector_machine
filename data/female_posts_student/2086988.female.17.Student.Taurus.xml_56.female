She told me I could come over one night and get wasted lol, hmmm I don't know...If I do Kiera and Embry will be right along with me! Yeah today was alot better than the past 2 days, dance is actually fun! And I have a 100 in german and dance, woo go me! That'll probably go down though, hehe.   Well today I've made an important decision, and I think I'm going to audition for Juilliard, yeah I know it's probably a total long shot, but I won't know unless I try. And I know that I really want to go into flim and television and this is mostly for performance arts, like broadway and stuff, I don't care anymore, it's acting and no matter if it's live or taped, it's the experience that counts. So this means that I've got to find 2 monolouges, one classical, one contemporary, memorize them, perfect them, and then either fly to Chicago or New York for the audition. I told my parents, I think they think I'm messing with them or something, but really I want to do this, and if I don't get in I'll just go to either UT or UNL, since going to UCLA would be too far, and it would complicate things alot more. I have like a year though, so it gives me  time to practice and stuff. Wooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   The smile on your face lets me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me A touch of your hand says you'll catch me where ever I fall Now you say it best ... when you say nothing at all
