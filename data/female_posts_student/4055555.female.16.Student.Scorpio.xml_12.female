On Wednesday me and John went to Liverpool as I had a last few things to buy for my hols... thanks John for bearing with me :D. I got a skirt and flip-flops and some bits and bobs. We went to Jay's house afterwards and had a good pig out on some sweets we bought in Tescos (well I didn't really as I had to go home earlish to pack). We also started to watch Goodfellas (that's a great movie!). It was a fun day.  Today I packed again in the morning after I had messed on the PC for a bit. Then my Dad took us to the libary to get some good books for the beach and the plane journey etc... I ended up getting good old Harry Potter, Cujo by Stephen King (he's brill!) and a Redwall book called Marlfox. Should keep me happy! At the moment, I'm just putting some tunes onto my MP3 to take away with me. Fun fun fun!  Right early night for me.. early morning tomorrow!  Have a good 2 weeks too! xxx
