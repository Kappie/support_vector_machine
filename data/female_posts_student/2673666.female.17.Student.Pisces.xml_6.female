Spent too much as usual, stuff included various paint, brushes (to be fair I do need it, but it still hurts my wallet).  Got my new tops through the post.    Here's one, pics of the other two will follow when my face is not smeared with a huge quantity of black eyeliner (had one of my moods earlier, don't ask).  Oh, also got a rather snazzy penknife, as I got fed up with sharpening my pencils with mediocre sharpeners.  Mum's ordered some boots for me too, which should come in the next few days.  Um... oh yeah, I've added my imood indicator to the sidebar.  Think that's all to report. Hugs, xL
