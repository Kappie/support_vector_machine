We got there Saturday and went to Epcot, though our flight didn't get to stay very long, because we got there last. Sunday we went to Magic Kingdom, and then had to march in our lovely parade. I kept thinking that it was going to rain during the parade, but no. It had to be burning hot instead. Oh, but afterwards it rained! That was pretty nice too, because we needed that cool weather. Haha, and let's not talk about Me, Manda and Candace's little freak out incident when we got back to Epcot. :-P  So then Monday we went to MGM, and that super cool. Me, Manda, Brad, and Neal got stuck doing this show in the backlot tour. Let's talk about that. So we're walking up to get in line for it, and this lady like pulls us aside and asks us to do the show, and we didn't even agree before she like shoved us back into this little room-like thing where we had to take off our shoes and sock, put on nasty, smelly black boots and this blue suit. I can not describe the stench of that thing. It was the worst thing I have ever smelled. So then, we get to go get water drenched on us. I was the mechanic, so I got it the worst of all. Lovely. So for the rest of the day we smelled absolutely horrid. Then the four of us plus Stuart and Sharon all went back to Magic Kingdom for a little while, until it closed. Then, on Tuesday we went to Universal Studio's Islands of Adventure. That was lots of fun. Well, after we got back, they told us they were going to wake us up at 3 a.m. So our room (Me, Candace, Amanda and Espi) decided that there was no point in sleeping. Well, one frappuccino and 5 cups of coffee later, it was 3 and we were off the walls. By the time we had to get on the buses, I think everyone else wanted us dead. I actually heard people saying things like "oh my gosh, someone shut them up!" But oh well, good for them, I found it rather amusing. Even the chaperones were getting rather angry. So our plane got home first, because we had a straight flight, unlike the other two, and so I went out to IHOP with my family, then came home and took a 6 hour nap. It was nice. Also getting 12 hours of sleep last night was quite grand.  Well, that's my trip. We had a damn good time, and now I'm finally all rested up.  So, that's all I have to say. I'm out, crazies.
