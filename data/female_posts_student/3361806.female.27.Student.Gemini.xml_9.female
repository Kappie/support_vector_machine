The presentation starts at 2:00pm and finish at 4:20pm I'm the second student who speaked.  There are so many questions from the lecturers and friends. It was good that i know how people think about my project or  what really i have to do in order to finish my project ?  One thing is i feel i don't prepare enough to speak english in front of the public. It's the first time.. it will be better and better in the future with ur support baby :)  xxx
