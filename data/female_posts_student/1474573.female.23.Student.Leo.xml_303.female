Oh, and then there's when it happens when you're at a kiddie amusement park with your best friend and her two kids on a sunny day with no pain killers in sight.  MMMHMM. (@#!$%*!%?#!)  That was me yesterday.  Luckily the kids are semi-old enough to understand that Auntie DyDy needed to be alone for a while to get better before taking them home.  They played with the sidewalk chalk on the porch while I rested inside.  In the dark.  With a pillow over my head to drown out sound/light/the world.  Unfortunately I didn't feel better soon enough so Steve took them home.  I felt so horrible in so many ways at that point of the afternoon.  I'm lucky to have him, really.    Okay, shameless gushing of how much I love my husband...  I love that man more than life itself and I ain't ashamed to admit it.  He is the only man I've ever been with that all my friends adore.  He's hilarious, he's handy, he can talk about anything to anyone.  He's practical, and yet once in awhile will buy me flowers or a card, or spend on something frivilously just for the heck of it or to remind me of how wonderful he is.  Oh, and I happen to think he's adorable too...Even when he says he wore sunscreen and comes back with a face as red as an apple...but that's another story... I truly don't know what I'd do without him and hopefully I'll never have to find out.  EVER.    You're the best, Babe.
