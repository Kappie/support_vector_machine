It was so strange. I actually cried when I realized I couldn't use my hand anymore. I could still feel my fingers moving, but all I cold see was the bloody stump. Then, in my dream, I passed out, because of the pain. When I "woke up" in my dream, the stump was my hand again, and there was scars from stitches. But when I tried to move my hand, the tendons had been connected wrong, and different fingers moved. It was both frightening and intriguing. Yuck.
