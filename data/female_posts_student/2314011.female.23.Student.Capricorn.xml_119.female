Don't have to bundle up quite as snug; the frost was still on the windows, but mostly because it didn't have anywhere else to be, it gave up easily.  There's nothing quite like the transition between winter and spring.  Fall is great and we love it; spring into summer is a party in itself, but winter into spring is unequaled.  There's a marked change in most everything when spring is on its way; it's very sudden.  One day is decidedly winter, the next, its grip is gone.  Not just slipping or easing; it's gone, and we wait for spring to arrive.
