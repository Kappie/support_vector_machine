Glad I had a mini-practice this morning...there was much groaning and sweating, and not entirely unpleasant at that!  Now just trying to relax for the night.  Got my mango-passion-fruit tea all hot and ready for consumption.  So tonight's class was a good time.  Instructor wore her tight, green tank-top; yes, a good night, indeed.  She's really a great teacher, I have to say.  Yes, it's true I have a fondness for teachers to begin with, but so what?  She's petite, wears black square-ish (bordering on geeky) glasses, has a little kid smile that dominates her face and Madonna-esque built arms.  She chants during the quiet, meditative "corpse pose" portion of the practice, which is such a nice touch.  Tank-tops are our friends.   Feeling better about everything in general today, which is nice.  My resolve's slipping back into place.  The other hormonal shoe's probably about to drop, though, so I'm preparing myself for that.  Suppose that's something you all get to look forward to: the updates on Andrea's menstrual cycle.  Yay!  It informs so much of my life at certain times that anyone close to me has the thing down almost as well as I do.  That's what we're all about here, after all.  Studied Torts all afternoon; feeling a bit more on top of that subject, at least.  It's actually one of the subjects that's come the most easily to me.  Probably because it deals a lot with finding a balance between various circumstances, principles, etc.  Balance Rocks!  Borrowed some study guides from Susan; she's so on top of that shit.    Called her on my way over to get them, and pulled into her driveway as the second ring ended:    "Answer, damnit!"  Pause and a bit of a laugh.  "Is that any way to talk to me?"  Yea, totally busted.  But it was a nice little classic moment.  Perhaps not as classic as others, but not bad.  She still let me in her house and borrow study materials, and I'm grateful.
