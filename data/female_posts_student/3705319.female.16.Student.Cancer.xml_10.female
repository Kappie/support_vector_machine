Meantime another wall was cleaned and the rest of the team were in classes, expectally as lucia ( one of the teachers) was sick so we were a bit thin on the ground. She wont be back all week so its gonna be a hard week of doing lessons. Rachel was also feeling  bit sick so she had the day off and her and Katy got to have a lie in! But the day was gorgeous and everyone felt a bit better now that the weather had picked up. Also the beautiful tea and coke and chocolate cake helped!  Wednesday Were a bit late but still made it on time got to watch the sunrise and ended up taking extreme photos out the car window… was so pretty. Doors got sized and fitted today in the beautiful sunshine. Wall got painted and classes ran … well mostly quite smoothly! Back at lodge out tonight at Celia’s cell group so having an early tea in the lovely sun! J   Prayer requests… Lucia – that she gets better Sun – that it stays Kids – that they will be happy but calm for classes Team – that we all don’t die of the cold… it could happen!
