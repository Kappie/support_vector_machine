My Aunt Linda has moved out of her house and into an apartment, leaving my Uncle Ed (my dad's brother) at home along with my cousin Jenny.  Darcy is so angry with ther mother, she says she doesn't want to go to the apartment.. she doesn't even want to know where it is.  Why is there so much unhappy relationships in this world?  NO ONE, i repeat NO ONE in my family saw this coming, never would have dreamed it happening to that family.  I really really feel bad for my cousins, i want to go down there right now and give Jenny a big hug and say, "it's okay Jenny! We Love You!!!!"  I wish we lived closer, i wish i got to see them more often.  ::sigh:: well it's back to the history notes now...
