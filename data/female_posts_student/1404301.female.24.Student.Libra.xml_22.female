As we are going to Sydney, Dylan and I tipped in advance for the next two rounds. My tips are as follows:   Round 16 : West Coast, Kangaroos, Richmond, Brisbane, Adelaide, Geelong, Port and Melbourne.   Round 17 : Essendon, Kangaroos, Freo, Brisbane, Western Bulldogs, Port, Geelong and Melbourne.   GO THE EAGLES  !
