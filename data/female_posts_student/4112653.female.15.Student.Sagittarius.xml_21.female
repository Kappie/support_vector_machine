Tell me, girl- what good will it do?"   "You always questioned everything... Why ask questions? Why not simply accept things as they are?" Marion was shoked to find the words of the man in white coming from her own lips.   Even more astonished was Tittanya. It was eerie to hear the exact words of her late friend. Eerie like a phantom of the past finally catching up to her.   "Damien..." she coughed, before dropping backwards off the roof.      Tittanya had no recollection of falling. She awoke to find a long-haired youth looking over her. Damien.   She supressed the emotions flooding her mind, and said passively, "What are you doing back again?"   "You've changed, Tittanya," the man replied. "Three years ago you would have greeted a friend with a smile if not an embrace. I see the world has hardened you. Where's the Tittanya I knew?"   "Yon  were  my friend. Not anymore. How can you be?- you're dead!" Tittanya cried, her eyes betraying her feelings. "The world has not altered me. I changed the day you left me in this world. Damien, why are you here?"
