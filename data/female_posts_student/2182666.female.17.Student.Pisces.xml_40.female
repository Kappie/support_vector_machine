You know how my dad is.. he wouldn't let me go out because of my chem exam. I am so sorry.. you have no idea how much I wanted to be there.  I think I've been watching too much sex and the city. I'm slowly becoming addicted to that show and the ironic thing is that I've become addicted once the show is off the air. lol One day I want my life to be like that. Well maybe without all the sex. I just want 3 best friends and to live in New York. I guess we'll have to wait and see..  So I guess I should get back to studying chem. If you guys have any words of encouragement or just feel like talking you know you can call me  jess
