My overconfidence is staggering.  :)  Started out bright and early:  up at 5:00 a.m., didn't even dress the boys - just rolled them out of bed in their PJ's and dropped them off at my mother's (my Dad takes them to daycare on his wya to work).  Thank heavens for my parents, otherwise I don't know how I'd manage.  Hats off to single parents without any kind of support system or network within their personal relationships.  Arrived to school early, around 7:45.  It's an hour commute each way, maybe 1 1/2 hours when the traffic's bad.  Lots of classmates were already there at that hour, though.  We all staked out good seats (in the front!) pretty early.  It's a very awkward shaped classroom we have.  They're remodeling a building on campus to serve as a brand new nursing department, but until its completion (next year) the building used in the meantime was once a dorm.  You can imagine, with all the walls knocked out, that the large support beams running through the middle of the now immense square rooms obstruct the view of the instructor and overhead quite a bit.    All morning, we had a sort of orientation.  Covering basic university and departmental policies, sexual harassment, grievance procedure, introduction of the 5 summer instructors, dress codes, etc.  We also had a library and computer resource lab tour.  Our schedule included a History of Nursing lecture, but we never got around to that.  After lunch (which I had in the cafeteria), we spent 4 hours non-stop listening to lecture and writing furiously, taking notes on universal/standard precautions, choosing, donning and removing PPE and infection control (basically a microbiology review).  Class let out at 4:30 and I think we all beat each other down getting out of there.  All of our lectures take place in the same room, so we stay put - only the instructors change.    There are 60 other students in my class.  Of those, maybe 3 including myself are married or have children.  There is one girl who is pregnant, due in September, right around the time we begin clinicals.  I told her she was a braver woman than I for undertaking that!  The only other "adult" student besides myself has grandchildren my children's age, an older Cajun lady from south Louisiana.  Maybe I should have tried the ASN program instead...  seems to be more non-trad students there?     Prayer request>That I find someone in my class to bond with.  Only one day in and I feel out of place, old, even alienated.  Lots of my classmates seem to know each other from pre-reqs or even high school (most early 20-somethings).  I'm hoping that I'll feel like I fit in more with time, it could just be my stranger-shyness peeking through.    So it was a very exciting day at school, I was thrilled to be there..  on the way home and once picking the kids up, I sort of had a meltdown.  Out of the classroom, my exhaustion and responsibilities are much more visceral.    On a nicer note, when I called my husband on his cell phone to see how work was going, he told me he was at my house.  I got there and he was washing dishes and taking out my trash - a very sweet surprise to get to see him and just kind of let things go, knowing he was in control.    I'm not sure if I can do this.  The 2-3 hours a day commuting, the 8 hours a day of class, the 2 little kids, the bills, the housework...   Even my grandmother asked, "Are you sure you haven't bitten off more than you can chew?"  I guess there's no turning back now.    That's all for now.  You'll have to forgive my atrocious grammar, I call myself a stream of consciousness type writer, and I just let the words flow as they come out - not giving much thought to my spelling and punctuation.  I'll be glad to accept any constructive criticism, though.
