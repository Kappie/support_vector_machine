I feel like I'm hiding behind something, hiding from something.  I feel anything but brave...I hide behind my words here.  I post only to make myself feel better, but I'm not sure that many results are acheived by my doing so.  I feel like every day I merely continue to prove my own futility to myself.  That said, I made it through the day, painful spots and all.  It was a little up and down, but all in all, though I didn't get much work done, I did acquit myself in a fairly good fashion.  And tomorrow will be upon me before I know it.  So maybe I am brave, at least partially.  So many times over the past couple of weeks, with the piles of work building up and my decreasing lack of affinity for law school, I've seriously contemplated dropping out.  Yet in it I still remain.  I am still standing, if barely, and each day I continue to stand, though I may feel weaker, I actually grow stronger, because I know I can take it.  Now all I have to do is remember that at my darkest moments.  So here's to tomorrow, and may it be better than yesterday.
