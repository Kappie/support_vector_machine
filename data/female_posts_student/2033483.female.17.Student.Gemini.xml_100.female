Those kids drive me bananas. Debbie, the mom, offered me the job for the entire summer next year. In all honesty, it may be easy money, but I don't want to be a nanny for my summer job again, so I'm going to work extra hard this spring.  At church yesterday, the most incredible sense of calmness came over me. I love going to church and being surrounded by the music and all the people coming together to praise God. I may not agree with everything the church preaches, but I can not deny that I love God. Lizzie and I had a good laugh at my ability to become a nun. I can just see the group meeting now..."What, you can't think that you're going to go to Hell for saying that"..."Good, I'll see you there"...I could never become a nun, that's not what God's plan is for me. But, bless the women that do choose that route. Church is great...the two places I feel safest are at home and at church.       I talked to Emily, I think it was on Saturday night, and we're going to try and have lunch sometime before school starts to catch up on each other's lives. It kinda bothered me the night of the Braid show how Alisha reacted to Steph being there and I don't want Emily and I to ever be like that. Don't get me wrong Steph and Alisha were nice to each other but it's weird knowing how good friends they used to be and then seeing them act a bit awkward around each other. I realize people grow and change but I still want Emily to know the person I've grown into.  I'm surprisingly really tired and it's only 7:30. I think I'm going to go rest for a bit.  I love you, Kay
