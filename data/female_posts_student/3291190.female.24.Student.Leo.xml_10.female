So lets be honest. Its often ugly, but its better than wrestling with it alone. I was raped  you think to yourself bo-fucking-ho. So many girls complain  cry about it  so did I. Believe me, I have spent more than my fair share of time crying, wondering why, going to counselor to "talk about it". The details are pointless. All that matters, is that for a while, I had my feeling of control, my sexuality  my pride taken away from me. So I became angry, a part of me still is. Its strange how you can be having sex  be somewhere else in your head. Anywhere but there, because apart of you is still scared, even though it happened years ago, these memories come flooding back, all at once. Afterwards sitting on the edge of the bed crying, telling him not to touch you.  trying to reassure him at the same time, that its ok, its not his fault, YOUR the one who is still fucked up, after all of these years. and I think to myself DAMN. How did this happen? How did I get here? Why can't I be close to anyone? Why do I feel so far away. Its like every time my parents would scream at me. I would go somewhere else in my head. A buffer zone, b/c there, they can't hurt you  they can't touch you. But the point to all of this is that I don't want this shit to define me. I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me. Worse shit happens everyday to a million different women. I just want to escape it. I can't watch movies like Gothika because they bring back fucked up memories. Its so hard b/c you want to be normal. To be able to watch these movies  then just turn it off. But instead it brings back associations that you buried long ago. I know I am going to have nightmares tonight. Sometimes I am really scared  I guess thats why I am so cold towards most men. Why I don't like for them to touch me, or hug me. Why I don't like to cuddle  I am distant. I refuse to let this shit define my life, but it sucks b/c every once in a while it comes back. You feel sick to your stomach  suddenly you are reliving the moments you always wanted to forget. I just don't want to relive this shit on my own, at times I want to reach out  talk to someone about it, so I could relieve some of the stress...but where do you start? It happened years ago, its over with, but just not for me.
