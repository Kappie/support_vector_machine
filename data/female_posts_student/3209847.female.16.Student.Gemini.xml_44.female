My throat has been hurting for the past 24 hours, but I'm getting better. We (Sarah and me) are doing great as well!   She has AP tests this week! Good luck Sarah! Calculus is going to be hard. I wish I could help ya. I'm sorry that I can't. You'll do fine! Alot of the sophomores are taking AP European, which they are going to ROCK on! You guys will do just fine! He's over-prepared you all. Good luck to everybody (especially Sarah, even though she doesn't need it)   Alllllrighty then... Let's start with.. friday? Okay, friday. Thursday felt like a Friday last week, so Friday was difficult to get through. I had voice lessons and then I drove straight to Casa Manana to have a meeting with Valerie Galloway-Chapa (Director of Education and Outreach). Basically, the meeting was about this week's recital and how I have to help. So I'm working after school all week this week (so much Fun... hehe, it'll be KINDA fun) After that, I had my LAST, I repeat  LAST  Casa Kids friday rehearsal! I cried like a BABY! We had to talk about what was our high point, something we learned, etc.. It was so sad. And then they changed the time of the saturday performance, so I couldn't perform!! I miss them already! hehe *tear* I cried so much. They really liked me. I didn't think they would. They were my only friends back in october. Isn't that weird?! I'll keep in touch with them. I love u guys!   After Casa Kids crying session, I got to go to a movie with Sarah and Andrew! YAY! hehe. I was walking to Sarah's car, I saw her hair cut!!! IT LOOOKS SO GOOD!! She DYED it! Her hair is no longer a virgin... hehehe! Anyway, I think it looks amazing! Sarah, you look stunning, I love it! We went to go see Mean Girls at tinseltown. It was ACTually pretty good (Aaaah! I didn't just say that) Yeah I did. It was pretty good. It started storming friday, kinda scary.   Alright we're up to Saturday. Haha, I should have posted earlier, this one's long! Around 12:30, my father, Sarah, and I started driving up to Oklahoma to see Chess at OU. We stopped around 2 at Macgeehee's and had catfish... mmmm.. sooooooooo good! After that my Dad showed us where he used to live in Oklahoma city, where he went to school, some of his favorite places.. It was kind of interesting. After that, we went to Hideaway's, a pizza place where my cousin works. It was really good!!! *yummmmy* So then.. we got to see Chess! woooww. We did some things WAY better than they did and they did some things WAY better than we did. Their One Night in Bangkok was AMAZING! They had a drag queen in it. Oh...... my....... god! It was incredible!! He was COOL! Oh wow, ask me about it on monday! Pity the Child was sooooo good too! They had him snorting cocaine so the song was kind of surreal and stuff. It was neato... Anyway! We got home at 2:00 in the morning. I was so tired.   Sunday. We had voice recital. Some people were absolutely amazing, I wasn't. Ah well, not everyone can be good. I'll take the hit. It's fine. I got to go to Cheddar's with Sarah afterwards, so I was okay. I'm going to go lay down for a while. I don't feel good. *kiss* to Sarah. bye bye
