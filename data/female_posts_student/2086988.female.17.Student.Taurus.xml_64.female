The national convention for International Thespian Society is being held in Lincoln, NE, at UNL from June 21st-26th, out of all the places! Heck yeah I'm going, this so has to be a sign! Woo woo, I'm so going, even though I have to help pay the $740 to go, though I don't care, I get to see my David and that is all that matters!!!!! Hey, spring break, 15 days...  I'm so going to go insane!! 3 cycles in a freaking month and a half, wtf? If it gets too irregular I can always get put on birth control, lol, wouldn't that be great? Then I could do whatever I wanted! hehe =p  Now, I'm going off to bed, to lay on my pillow that smells like David's cologne, holding my Gir doll and listening to jazz music, imagining instead of Gir that was David...:::sigh::: lol too bad we wouldn't be doing that much sleeping ;)   You can hardly wait to tell all your friends How his kisses taste sweet like wine And how he always makes your heart skip a beat
