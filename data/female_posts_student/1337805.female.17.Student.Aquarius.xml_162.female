I know, just restart computer, but that's effort. Too lazy. Makes me think more this way.  Watched loads of movies with Laura. The ring, Blair Witch 12, Others, Hannibal, Casper, Hocus Pocus, Sleepy Hollow, The Craft, and Final Destination at Lauren's. Fun fun.  Stayed up way too late, feel sick now.   Hope everyone that went to Oregon had a kick ass time, I was thinking about it the entire weekend. The only good thing, was I got to have a shot or two of vodka, where I wouldn't have if I travelled to Oregon with yall.  Supposed to see Adam tomorw, hurrah for that. I also get my Sugar baby. It's going to be a girl, and I'm either going with Adam's suggestion of Aurian Elizabeth, or my own  Mayla Tayler. I'm really rather excited. And Tuesday night is youth night, so double hurrah for that. Must remember to oranize forms of transportation for that.   Anyways, my tea is running thin, and I'm passing out. Night!
