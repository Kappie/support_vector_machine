I'm a self-absorbed asshole that can't keep my fucking hands out of people's business.  I guess it's because I'm trying to help them or something, but EVERY SINGLE TIME I fuck things up and I should just not do that anymore.  People will be much better off if I stick to myself.  I mean, if these people WANT to tell me things or ask my advice fine that's great I really do like helping people but please, if you do?  Swear me to secrecy or something because I am, like I said, a fuck-face. *sigh*
