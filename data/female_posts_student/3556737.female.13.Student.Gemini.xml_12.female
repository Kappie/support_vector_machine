They have to really work hard because school is coming up and vacation's over (well, almost over...). Actually, we do still have 2 months left to cool off, but i don't think that's enough. For ten months we were at school, now only 2 months vacation? Anyone want to join me in a strike-something-whatever? Well, you can join me once i know how to strike-something-whatever. I don't really know a lot of stuff in life because i'm just a teenkid? Or something like a kid turning teen.  Well, i hope a lot of "teenkid" like me relates to what i'm saying right now, or some adult who went pass by my experiences right now understands me.  That was a very tiring day for me... Hope to get some comments from you....
