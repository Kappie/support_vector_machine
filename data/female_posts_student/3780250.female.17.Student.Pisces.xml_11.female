They are cool girls. I like them. I was so happy to see her, when I first saw her my heart just jumped, it started beating real fast I thought it was going to bust out of my chest. I forgot to tell her I get car sick if I am not driving or in the front seat. Even being in the front seat makes me a little sick, so the ride to the hotel was mostly quiet,except for mal and lauren fighting and playing around. We finaly got to the hotel and we were  chillen on the beds in the cool because it's hot as hell out here. Then Mal and lauren were shotting off fireworks, Shanna and I stayed inside and were kissing and just talking. My girlfriend has the softest, most beautiful lips in the world. OMG I couldn't stop kissing her.Her lips are the kind of lips I love not too big but big enough that after you're done kissing you kinda nibble on them. They are so soft too. I loved kissing her I can't wait to do it again. And her eyes OMG again when I looked into them I just got lost like I couldn't turn away from them, like I was just trapped in her gaze it was so great. I rubbed her cheek and face with my fingertips and hands she has the softest skin, like silk to touch. I was looking at her one time during the night and she asked what's wrong there was nothing wrong I just wanted to make sure all of that moment of just being together would stay in my mind for the rest of my life. Everytime she got close to me, I don't know if she knows this or not, but I would breath her scent in so I could remember just the way she smelled. She also doesn't know I stole the pillowcase from the hotel pillow, the one she slept most of the night on so that I could always smell her. Every touch, smell, kiss is locked in my memory from now on. I remember just the way her kisses tasted, I remember every little goosebump and chill. This was the best time of my life and it is even more special because I spent it with the girl that I want and if everthing works out right will spend the rest of my life with!!! being with her this weekend made me see how truly blessed I am to have her in my life. Spending this weekend with her brought us so much closer and it help me see that she is the only one I want and will ever need in my life. I told her she has changed my life  for the better and she truly has changed my life and me. She is important to me, she has become my life, my everything and I love her more and more each day. i guess that is it for now. OH you thought I was going to give you all the sexy, horny details didn't you??? Sorry that is for us to know and for you to wonder about lol I LOVE YOU SHANNA
