Actually, sunset is more dramatic to watch than any other drama movies. It's a one-of-a-kind experience. It's like, if sunsets, sun wouldn't rise anymore. Had you ever felt that?  I don't know, but if i'm talking about night, how did i end up talking about sunset and sunrise?  Whatever! All i know is i'm so happy if i watch the sunset... "All i know is i'm so happy when you're dancing there... I'm a slave for You!!!" (JOKE)
