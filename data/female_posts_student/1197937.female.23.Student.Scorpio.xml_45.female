A word: that is melliflous, ubiquitously applicable, and whose conditional usage centrifuges the bona fide erudite from the linguistic dilettantes. and the word is...distill---to extract the essence of. (ta-da, unadorned, unpretentious, and still meaningful)  True friends: are bound by an elastic band. sometimes, that band stretches far and taut, but every now and then, it will snap back in place in time by something as simple as a call. and everything will be as it always was.   Weekends: make the weekdays short. like singing in traffic. and a spoonful of sugar, helps the medicine go down, the medicine go doooowwn, the medicine go down.  The scent of a new book: is only less fragrant than that of a used one.  Wearing clicking heels and putting on lipstick: give me the same tingly feeling of being a real-life grown-up now as they did back when i was five.  Sleep: is a beautiful thing. but like many truly beautiful things, can be easily overlooked.    Mr. Keating from the Dead Poets Society:  "That the perpetual play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.  What will your verse be...?"
