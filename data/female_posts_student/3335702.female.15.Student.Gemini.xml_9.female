I bought some dresses, some undergarments (hehe), and jewelry. I still need my cool adio's! Josh talked to me earlier, he got his eyebrow pierced and broke up with his girlfriend. It was kinda exciting, because now I can actually flirt with him without feeling bad. He joked around about using some condoms, I think I might just consider it. Ian nabbed me some condoms from the aids center, I was supposed to go get them tonight downtown, but Aikens turned me down, so I was forced to stay home and retreat to a world of boredom. I thought a lot about my baby today. He has incredible blue eyes and I'm just thinking about how in love I am with him and his endless, deep, blue eyes. I just can't imagine a less than perfect moment with him. Tonight I was thinking about lying on warm pavement on a summer night staring at the stars with him. Aw, I'm in such a sappy mood, but it's soo true. He's just so amazing and everything I could hope for in a guy. He's such a jackass sometimes, but when he's acting serious, he's such an incredible person, with a huge heart. I just hope there's room for me in there (= hehe! Once again I've found a song to describe my feelings so here it goes.      Well there's a light in your eye that keeps shining Like a star that can't wait for the night I hate to think I've been blinded baby Why can't I see you tonight? And the warmth of your smile starts a-burnin' And the thrill of your touch gives me fright And I'm shaking so much, really yearning Why don't you show up, make it all right? Yeah, it's all right. And if you promised you'd love so completely and you said you would always be true You swore that you would never leave me, baby: What ever happened to you? And you thought it was only in movies As you wish all your dreams would come true It ain't the first time believe me, baby I'm standin here feeling blue Yeah I'm blue Now I will stand in the rain on the corner I'll watch the people go shuffling downtown Another ten minutes no longer And then I'm turning around The clock on the wall's moving slower My heart it sinks to the ground And the storm that I thought would blow over Clouds the light of the love that I found Now my body is starting to quiver And the palms of my hands getting wet I've got no reason to doubt you baby, It's all a terrible mess I'll run in the rain till I'm breathless When I'm breathless I'll run till I drop, hey The thoughts of a fool's kind of careless I'm just a fool waiting on the wrong block, oh yeah Light of the love that I found...  -Led Zeppelin, Fool In the Rain
