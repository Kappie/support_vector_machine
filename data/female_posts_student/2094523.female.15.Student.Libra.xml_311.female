Will you be the one to sweep me off my feet?  i live in a fairytale  The hardcover book, those yellow tinted pages  Lack of controversies A knight in shining armor I'll be your princess.   Will you be the one to break my heart? Every whisper in my ear Caressing every word you speak Breathing every scent in you Don't shatter my heart I can do that myself.
