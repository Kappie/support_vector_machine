Actual time to make calls from my cell (after 9 PM). Time to rest. Sleep. Recooperate.  Calls start tomorrow night. For now, I'm too tired, without the ample energy needed to get into my usual conversations. Looking forward to hearingfamiliar voices, and new voices. You know who you are. ;) -Kaleigh Jo-   P.s. - Ben: Just email me, kid. Stop snooping on my site! lol.     Love you all dearly.
