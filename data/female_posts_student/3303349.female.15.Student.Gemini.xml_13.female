But looking on the slightly duller brightside...it will be over before I know it and it's the last one of the year. Grrr...makes me mad...I am still tribly sore from the mile that I ran YESTERDAY! Holy crap! I think they're trying to kill us! Obviously I haven't had that much time to think about this. I've been too concerened with sticcato notes! why I don't know. I really hope tomorrow is a good day or I will be in such a bad mood. But it probably will be. Because that's just the way it goes.  I got to skip 7th period today to go to the orthodontist. I still don't know when i get these stupid braces off! They are throwing off my flute playing! Yeah...I should really get out of this spitteful mood...I conld talk about my stalker! He didn't stalk me as much today. Hmmm....he followed me to the feild house and I didn't really know he was there so that was one of the scareyest sensations of my life...felling like someone is behind you. Oh yeah then Mark was "stoned" in health class. It scared me so much. I mean on a deeper level. Hummm...I know something more interesting must have happened today but it doesn't seem to be surfacing...It was snowing again today. I miss wearing skirts...they amuse me so much. I need to practice scales...just in general. Good for technique...and I could also practice my sticcato notes. I con't play them very well. Good for speed. Yeah don't make me put so much effort into tounging. Humm...well be for I get too much into theiory...I'm gonna stop now. Cherio people!
