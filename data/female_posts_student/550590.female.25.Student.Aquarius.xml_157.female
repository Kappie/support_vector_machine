Sigh. A group of us are going to the first showing at the Winter Park Village at 12:01 am on Thursday. Those of us who are REALLY dorks are wearing costumes. Of course I'll post pictures!  For no reason other than I am an awesome girlfriend, I received a beautiful diamond pendant and the new Harry Potter PC game from my hottie boyfriend Bruce last night. He definitely wins the most awesome boyfriend in the world award. My favorite part was when he hands me the jewelry box he prefaces it with "it's not an engagement ring." Ah, baby... :)
