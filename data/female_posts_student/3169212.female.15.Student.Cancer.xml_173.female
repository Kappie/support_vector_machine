I've never actually been dead. (Ah, the sheltered life of a Tau'ri! Or Erdling, if you like the term better. Same diff.) But I have memories of coming awfully close.   So you've been brought back, huh? How? I mean... I don't want to say too much, but I thought we didn't have the technology any more than we have the technology to... throw people across the room without touching them and without harming them except for impact with the ground.  What war did you fight in, Church? I don't recognize the sides.
