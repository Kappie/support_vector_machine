DOES IT REALLY MATTER? whoever invented the damn calender must be on crack. i mean days and dates doesnt matter its not like we're gonna remember what we did on say Feb. 23 1992.. liek what the hell. each and every day is the same ok. theres NO fuckin difference.. Like i mean when u get up in the morning does somethung eventful happen? and when u get to skool does somethun interesting happen? even if there was its not like ull remember what happened or what u said an hr ago. yup we're all dumb like that.. I TOLDJA humans are stupid I TOLDJA we're the dumbest thing on this living planet
