Because she apologized to him for being mad that he spent more time with his ex. Oh God forbid he apologize for screwing her over for another woman.  HUGE mistake, enough said.   I am just about ready to go pick up my paycheck from Hardee's. It'll probably be around $100, and that's cool with me. I really need to put together a birthday present for Heather because her 17th is tomorrow, and to do that I need money. Talk about waiting until the last minute, especially for a best friend. Shh.... she'll never know.   Tonight is the game, well, at 4:00 to be precise. I'm really scared to tell you the truth. Not only is the fact that I am playing a singles match against an Edgewood girl highly intimidating, but I guess a lot of people are coming to watch. I don't want a blue million people coming to watch me lose! (Talk about being negative, Jennica.)
