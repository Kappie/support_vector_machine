Martha Stewart was sentenced Friday to five months in prison for a stock-trading scandal, moving one step closer to a drastically different lifestyle behind bars when the millionaire entrepreneur.  "I'll be back," she promised afterward, speaking in a strong voice on the courthouse steps. "I'm not afraid. Not afraid whatsoever. I'm very sorry it had to come to this."   Am I the only one who finds this entire situation funny?   To be perfectly honest with you, I could care less about good old Martha.  Should  she being going to jail? Absolutely. HOWEVER. To put her in jail, while scumbags from Enron (or any other huge corporation for that matter) only receive slaps on the wrists, seems to me, to be somewhat wrong.   Well they made a great example out of Martha. They sure showed us. Boy, I'll tell you, I'll  never  jump on the stock-tip/trading bandwagon. Oh no. Not me. Never.   Unless, of course, I donate considerable sums of money, to the whatever current political party, is in charge of the country. Because then. And only then. Will you be able to get away with it.   Somebody  really  should have told Martha this.
