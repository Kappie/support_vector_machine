I usually have to put them out of reach when I take them off, so that he can't chew them, but the moment I become careless and leave them on the floor, he is all over them.  Come to think of it, I can't tell if it is blind, seething rage that he has for these flip flops or a sick, perverse love for them. One of the times I caught him in the act, he had rubbed his face all over the shoes, like it was cat nip. Only not cat nip, because he doesn't like cat nip.  But after this ritualistic gesture of smearing his scent all over the shoes, he began voraciously tearing apart the soles of the shoes like it was some sort of injured gazelle he caught in the Serengeti. It was vicious. I even had to avert my eyes from the carcass for a moment before I snatched the shoe away from his grip.  He doesn't seem to get this "crazed" when it comes to my other shoes. Sometimes, he will sniff them and paw at them a bit, but they don't bring out the same raw, animalistic tendencies.   After careful study of his habits, like Diane Fossi or Jane Goodall, I have determined that he is merely prejudiced against cheap shoes, and gets off on performing ritualize shoe-icide upon them.
