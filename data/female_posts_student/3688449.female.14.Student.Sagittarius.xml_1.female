We were talking about basically nothing when Rebekkah mentions how she talked to Adam (or something like that) So anyways, Ash blurts out, "What's up with you and Adam? Why do you always hang together? Does he like you or something?" OMG!!! What an IDIOT!! They're cousins, remember?!? Eww...incest!!! But yah, that was the whole jist of it, um, you'll probably see more about it on other people's blogs. So till next time, Love and Madness!
