Last night i chatted with David B. and he basically kept telling me he was hard and masturbation and him and i having sex lol , and i mentioned something about him and i NOT dating and he was like oh why not? and i was like shocked, so idk whats going on there,I do know that if him and i do date, the whole seeing each other naked thing is out of the way! he stripped for krissy and i and when we were leaving he jumped on krissy car and she went in reverse really fast and it burned his balls! lol funny i know. He can be so sweet but i do know how he feels about women having power and hes very, Im the man and ur the woman, so u better listen to me, type of guy and im not that type of girl,lol so idk.. i guess we'll see. And tonight i had a LONG convo with Amy. Now if u dont know who amy is , amy is one of the members of the fudgesters, and if u dont know who they are, lol they are a group consisting of me, sarah, krissy, and amy. Everyone at hns wanted to be in the group but we were like no! and we were all best friends and it was kickass! well i remember hns graduation and i remember crying bc i knew i wasnt gonna ever see them again and i remember amy saying, we'll always be close and hang out, and guess what, that shit didnt happen. Sarah and amy grew apart and they basically forgot about krissy and i. Well amy and i chatted about everything that happened in our lives , like old bfs, sex, drugs, friends, drama and all that good crap. it was nice just opening up with her again. People dont realize how close we all were, it was almost sad lol. Well i told amy that i would go to her vball game when BG plays Rhs, so ill get to see her there.
