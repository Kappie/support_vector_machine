I have spent the morning signing papers and packing my stuff into boxes. It is doing monotonous tasks such as these that have led my mind to do nothing but think. This is a crime I am guilty of more than not. Thinking. Thinking too much. Thinking of things that will never happen too much. Oh well. God save the �King�.  On a completely different note, I was chatting with my buddy Chris last night, and it seems that he has found a connection of sorts with a nice young lady. Lets talk about this guy for a minute. The great thing about Chris is�well�that he is Chris. His personality is a little hard to read at first (this goes back to the fact that I was probably thinking about it too much at the time). He is really special in my eyes�being a return LDS Missionary, having good strong values and ideas, living with his dad on their own, and still being able to love TOOL. It is really hard, at least it has been for me, to describe a person and use LDS and TOOL in the same sentence without one negating the other. Special I tell you! I just wanted to write a blurb that I know even in my trials, that it is great to hear that things are going well for my friends. With Chris and �the 18 year old� as to which she is referred, he deserves to be happy and for things to work out. Chris was the one who originally turned me onto this BLOG thing. Check out his Blog here,  urlLink  SUPER DOOPER FLOOPIE FLAKES.   Special I tell you! Good luck Chris!  We are in �Hell Week� rehearsals for �No One Will Marry a Princess with a Tree Growing Out of Her Head.� Our rehearsals have now stretched to about 5 hours in length at the performing arts center. It is really great to be out of the small black box theatre at the college, but I think the growth of the space has scared my actors just a bit. We set sound cues yesterday and will spend most of today setting light cues. These are the joyous, fun, and exciting times of running theatre. I am sure all that can relate will agree with me. They will either agree with me or knock me in the head and tell me I am crazy. I may lean more towards the later than the first. Oh well.  Over all, the show is going good. The thing with live stage shows (I may actually get theatre people to agree with me on this), is that during the last week of rehearsal there is a defining moment where the director and those working with him see the cast �click� into the show. They �click� into their characters, into their setting, and they �click� with each other onstage. This moment is the point where the director (and stage manager, me) are convinced that it will be a good show and that things will, despite any opposition, work for the best. The timing of this moment is different for every cast. It has been different for every show I have ever worked on, but eventually the �click� does happen. To make this already long story shorter, we are still looking for this moment with the cast of �Princess Tree Head�.   I wrote quite a bit this go-around. I must unfortunately get myself back to packing�and thinking, dammit. He we go again�
