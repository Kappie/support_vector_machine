Can you put pictures on here now without having to use Hello? Anyway, Rick wants me to start posting the comics that I've made. He says they're funny but y'all will probably think otherwise.. I'll post some later, I guess. I'm worried about the ACT.. I need to take it. But I have to go help my mother with the groceries.. Bye all. -=Tim=-
