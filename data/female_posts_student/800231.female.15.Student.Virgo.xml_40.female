She was giving textbooks to a few people that hadn't received them yet and was shuffling notecards with student's names on them at the start of class. Shawn said quite loudly "Are you going to name us?" (in reference to the notecards in Mrs. N's hand) Mrs. N stared blankly at him for a bit before saying "Did you say anus?" "No, I said name us..." Mrs. N starts jumping up and down and screaming "ANUS? Did you call me an anus?!" "No! 'Name us!'" "Oh right. Yeah, whatever..."  Later we were talking about the differences between the Central Nervous System (CNS) and the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) . Halfway through a sentence, Mrs N. Stopped and started giggling uncontrollably "You know what? PNS sounds like penis!" and then she fell over from laughing so hard. How sad is that? Some health teacher.  Did nothing in Photography today, 'sept draw with some random kid. He drew me a lovely picture of a girl picking her nose though. Lovely.   More sleep good. :)
