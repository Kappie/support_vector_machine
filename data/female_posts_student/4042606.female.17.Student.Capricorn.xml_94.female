My mother picked up, and I specifically told her if Jackie called, not to tell her that I was with Ian. Guess what? My mom said this "Oh Jackie honey! I'm sorry Abby is with her friend Ian". Thank you mom for fucking up an already fucked up situation. I called her back when I got home and big suprise Jackie is flaming. I got a long lecture on how Ian is a jerk and is just hanging out with me so he can get into my "pants". Let me say Mute is nothing like how Jackie is describing him. Mute, in his entire life has nevered asked for sex, or anything assosiated with it. I know him much better than Jackie ever did. She needs to shut the fuck off. I am nothing like her either, I will not sleep around like Jackie is known for doing. Mute and I are just really good friends. We have been so since we were around 9. So I think I have a better insight on Mute, then my dumbass sister.
