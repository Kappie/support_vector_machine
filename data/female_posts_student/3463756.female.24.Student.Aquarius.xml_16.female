I spent a lot of time anticipating this reunion. I left hyderabad at a time when everything was good. The move affected me. It affected my best friend. In some ways it altered my life course even. But it taught me one thing, that u may move and so on but people who want to be friends will find a way. The relationship continues. It may be altered, but it continues.  I went to meet my best friend and spend time with her and my other close friend. She didn't turn up, but my best friend did. Case in point, she would do anything she can for me when I need, just the way I would for her.  I enjoyed the weekend. We cooked, we ate a lot! And we talked quite a bit. NAS is getting married next year. The guy she wanted. So good things do happen to those who wait. It's the waiting in itself that tears you up inside.  K, I must confess, has to put up with quite a bit from me. The poor dear missed me a lot over the vacant. I hope when the time comes for me to leave he is able to bear it... He was so happy when I returned...  More photos coming up from the weekend.. But that's a job I will do a little later.
