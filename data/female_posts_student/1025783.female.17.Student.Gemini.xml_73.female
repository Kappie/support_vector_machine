They dismissed me as crazy and generally left me alone. Then one night it hit me. I watched as their torches came slowly over the horizon and I knew what I had to do. The Mayson residence was their safehouse, their haven. To get rid of their haven would be to get rid of them. It was dilapidated, dying already. It wouldn't be hard to burn the hell hole to the ground. I spent that evening looking down upon the monsters, smiling and waving sweetly at Lily who howled and leapt and clawed at the ground and walls. I spent that night anxiously waiting until they left, trudging back to the forest. I slipped out of the house, provisions in my cloak pockets, kicking aside their now dead amusement from hours before. My foot got caught in the man's jacket and I pulled sharply. Something caught my foot and I fell to the ground hard, hitting my head on a sharp stone. I became groggy and everything blurred. The last thing I remember seeing was the dead man's face, leering at me, putrid stale breath choking me slowly. It must of been much later that I woke up. My head throbbed and I could feel the dried cracked blood on the back of my neck. Why was I still alive? I thought desperately. And where was I? I tried to rise, and felt a reeling in my head, and a dull pain through my body. I sat into a fetal position and had a look at my surroundings. I was in some kind of a barn it looked. The room was small and dark, furnished with nothing but a cold stone floor, some dry pieces of hay and a shivering candle. The one lone door was heavy oak, and had been most likely locked. Sure enough, as I rose slowly and walked stiffly over to it, I was unable to open it. I looked over to the candle, and my first thought of burning the house down came to mind. Good idea Meredith, I muttered. Never smart to burn a house down while you're locked inside. I looked all around the room in vain, trying to find a means of escaping before my captors came back. I sat down against one of the cold slabs of wall and sighed. A beetle scuttled in front of me. I eyed it, and my mouth began to salivate. A hand shot of, crushing the beetle in it's grasp, juice oozed out of it's decaying palm. The hand rose to my mouth, and I realized it was own. I swallowed the beatle ravenously, smacking my lips. My mind began to work faster, the room began to spin. Click, click, click- little pictures of what had happened began to form in my mind. My body seperated from my mind, both reeling and lurching with new rythyms and motion. Inside I was screaming, outside I was a beast. They had blood- induced me, Lily herself smiling broadly eyes blank and round like those of a great white shark. She had taken me as her prize, her toy. I was half awake when she pulled me to her. Her body was dead and rotten, chunks of flesh had dropped off, leaving molding pieces of bones and muscles filled with maggots. She pulled my face to hers and kissed me lightly on the cheek, her lips dry and cracked with blood. I pulled at her hair and her face in vain attempts to get away, but she just laughed darkly as her cold hands gripped my tighter. Her lips left a trail down my cheek, towards my neck. I felt her sharp fangs plunge into a big, fat juicy vein and for a brief spasm I shook with pain. My body crumpled after that, and I fell asleep- only to be thrown into this cell. It was complete I thought bitterly, as I snapped out of my reverie. I sat there, calmly watching my body lurch and grovel around the small barn, reeling and banging itself against the walls. I wanted meat, and blood and pain. I wanted to cause pain, and feel hurt seep within my pores. I knew it wasnt right, but then a deep laughter filled the tiny room. Maniac laughter that sputtered and kicked and growled. I looked around the room in surprise, only to find the laughter coming from deep within my soul...The monster had been born.
