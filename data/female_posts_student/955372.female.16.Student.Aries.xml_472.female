BUT she had an attack of lupus (which we didn't even know she had) she's in ICU so we came home early to see her. I went to see her yesterday. I was so hard to see her hooked up to all those machines, she didn't even recognize me. I started crying. I felt really stupid. and i didn't want anyone to see me like that because then i would like take the attention, and it wasn't about me. um, Also yesterday we were at my aunt mary's before visiting hours at the hospital, mum thought I should participate with my cousins so she forced me to play basketball outside with them.. in a skirt... and flip flops... and an absolute hatred for basketball, needless to say i fell (because some midget from next door like head butted me) scraped up my legs, and the slit in my skirt miraculously  extended itself to a tres inapropriate length. yes thank you mother.
