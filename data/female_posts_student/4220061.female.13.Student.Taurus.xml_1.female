I didn't get froshed. The kid next to me in Chemistry said 'happy freshman friday'. That's just about it, though. My mom teaches so many kids that I know. That is so weird. Around 8 people that I know have her and it is kind of awkward. I think I discussed this in my previous entry. In chemistry I don't know anybody really so I ended up being the dregs of lab partner choices so I'm with this one guy and this one girl and they're probably not too cool, because if they were, then they'd have lab partners. I won't judge- maybe they're like me and just don't know anybody and then we'll all build a friendship that will last a lifetime. I'm being silly again.  I went to the freshman mixer. It was kinda cool I guess. I don't dance... but I kind of did. I hung out with Luke most of the time and i saw Nicole D., Michelle, Patrick and Wesley so I guess it was pretty cool. There were all of these gross people like Mandy and Ryanne and Sarah Murphy and Shane and Zach... all of those really nasty kids all grinding with eachother and I was in tears from laughing so hard. I swear to god, if they were naked... ew don't wanna think about it.  I think that by now, people have figured out that my mother is my mother. 1. My last name 2. I'm from Canada 3. I'm sure she's mentioned me 4. I sometimes stop by between classes The gig is up! As long as she's cool, I do not have a problem with any of it. Ohhhh well.  Party on!  -Candice
