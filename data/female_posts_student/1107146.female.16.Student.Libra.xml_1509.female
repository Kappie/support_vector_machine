But that should sound absolutely incredible, I think I would have a slight heart attack, seizure, and aneurism at the same time if I heard it. Good luck!...altho the next time youse goys (*woot i said uz goys, linds is gonna pwn me*) read this it shall be over and we shall hear your tortured tales of a nice, Christian-ly wholesome night of family fun. Yay!  Will Whiteside, you are incredible. I think you've been reading your Rhetoric, atlho slightly twisting the whole "no affronting the receiver of an argument" part, but whatever, yo. Tizotally bizongin', wizurd. Thanks for the sympathies. I would say more about it but I have to stop myself from laughing after reading that soliliquy of my defense, which shall last (the laughing, that is) for the next few days or so because I am incredibly bored, locking myself in my room as soon as I wake up and working out songs, putting together Abby's party, fixing my amps, playing cool video games ( Lord of the Rings , God curse it), jumping off the roof of my house (that requires unlocking my room, but it happens), setting things on fire, setting myself on fire, breaking stuff, going to Taco Bell, etc. It may seem very thrilling...   SURPRISE   !!!! It sucks!  I'm going to go back up to my room now and try not to break a limbsorryabbyiknowyou'llbemadbutitstoomuchfuniloveyouplease?.   Subliminal messages are awesome. I'm going to stop doing drugs now and leave you all at peace.
