I lay on the bed, taking my last few breaths, Thinking of you, and all the times we've had, Regretting, decisions I made.... Oh, What I wouldn't do...to go back... Change what we had, I don't want it... Infatuation, is what all it was... Did not have a deeper meaning, Thoughts provoke me, I am miserable, I don't have much time..... Oh what I wouldn't do....to go back... Lying on my bed, with the last few breaths... Tears run down my cheeks, If only I had another chance, Oh what wouldn't I do... To make you realize...to only tell you...I am sorry... Alas, it's time for me to part... My eyes close...my last tear drops.. I bid farewell....
