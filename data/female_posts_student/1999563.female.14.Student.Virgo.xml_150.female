Now I am scared out of my wits....  I took a really short shower so there is still some shampoo in it...yuck!  Every little sound I hear I think its a bomd or someone coming to kill me. Our house is quite scary in the mornings, I can't wait for day light.   On a lighter note..  I really really want a digital camera for christmas! :D
