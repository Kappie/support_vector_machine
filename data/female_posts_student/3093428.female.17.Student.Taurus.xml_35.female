Am I the only one who think it's a bummer that bowling this Friday costs $10? Did it use to be $4.75 or something? But then again, that was Lois Lanes. And apparently, we're going to the Zone this time. So I guess it'll work out eventually. Also noted in the Youth update/e-mail, there is, IN FACT, an all-nighter being planned for the 25th. My last exam is the day before. So I will have lots to celebrate. Who votes we play Cops  Robbers in the dark again, like last time? Dude, that was so rad.  My throat hurts. I really hope it's not sickness coming to steal me away right before exams. Let's hope I don't fall ill. That would suck a lot.
