I want these questions answered  I want my thoughts to calm  I want my questions to go away   But we don't always get what we want  And questions don't always get answered  Even though I beg  And plead  They still linger in my mind  Constantly plaguing my thoughts   I feel like I'm drowning in questions  without answers  without help  without anyone   Do I love you?  Does love exist?
