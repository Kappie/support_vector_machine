Am having serious qualms about materialism and some things that go on. I want to make some use of my time so I end up reading on the couch. Television seems too outright lazy.  I've so lost track of what I want to be. What do I want to do, anyways? I'm having lunch with Sylvia tomorrow. I have a piano lesson. I'm going to volunteer on Tuesday, go to the beach on Friday. Go to Third Street with Nige on Wednesday. And that's my week up until flying to Boston Friday night.  It's just all so wrong, I think. And I don't know why. Really now, what is the meaning of life? You just have to think, most of the people you know are purely worthless to you. And then you have your friends, which you purposely try to keep small in number, because what's the point of having so many people around you? I need a project, a magnum opus.  You know, I was also thinking of how lucky I am. In some ways, I have it good, and I won't number them here. Secrets are better kept inside.  Maybe it's just going crazy without having something regular to do. I would really be a wreck if I retired. There's no more school and schoolwork and orchestra anymore. I'm only home for two weeks and a little more, so that eliminates the possibility of a job. I've already washed a goodly amount of dishes, taken out the trash. The suitcase is cracked open on the floor in my room. Today I've read, I've gone out with Mom and Grandma, I've returned the cable to Best Buy since Mom has one. I've worn the same pair of jeans for a few days now, not that anybody really cares. In a funny way, I almost don't want anybody's company to fill this void. I think I'd be equally happy entertained with a movie, except I don't feel like one.  Well now, I guess I'm just mercurial and picky and lost.  I think I could just sit here forever and write nothingness. I was up in bed reading last night since I couldn't fall asleep and all of a sudden the words on the page distanced themselves and I felt dizzy. Everything is just so messed up.  I'm so confused.  What could I do that takes up the whole entire day and is marginally appealing? I imagine I'm going to go somewhere, but I feel bad about spending money.   That's funny, I don't now. Wednesday's a go.  I'm trying to fill out that Amherst app.  Maybe I should go online and request real applications, that would be somewhat productive.  Yeah, I'll go do that now.  I'm all right, don't listen to me.
