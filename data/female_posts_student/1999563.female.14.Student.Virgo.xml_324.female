I wish I could be in Sara's class.  i think that Sara is like my closest friend at school and I am not in any of her classes!  Today lunch was AWESOME!  Sara and I went outsidde and just sat in the grass. Then we layed on the grass and stared at the clouds. It was awesome.  We decided to be hippies. I need to find TONS of flowy dresses. They had sue-wheat ones at target for fairly cheap.. :)   Hippies rock.  Then I went to tennis. I am doing so much better!! I'm quite proud of myself. :)  Then!  I got home and I had TWOOOOOOOO packages!!  Tee hehehehe.  One was from Superchick.  Aww :) They said they were sorry about how at the concert I was supposed to have a neet and greet but we didn't. But it was fine by me because I got to work merch which was FUN!  So they sent me an autographed photo. Which is pretty cool, even though I have TONS of there autographs already :)  My second package was my FREE pretty lip gloss from Lucky Magazine! Yipee!  Its quite gorgeous.  Then they also gave me a bunch of face stuff samples.  yay.  What  a beautiful day.
