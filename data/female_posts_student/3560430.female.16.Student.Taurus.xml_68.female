Normally I wouln\dn't be so disturbed about it except he started just as I was beginning to post. His tail is running across the key board.     I'm soon to have the house entirly to myself! Yay! This is going to sound really pathetic but, I'm actually looking forward to arranging my desk. As for word of other roomly stuff I've finally put up the beautiful poster that I got for my birthdaym, and it looks really great on my door. Oh good cat has abandoned desk.     Beth and I had a great night. Five hours of cleaning, five bags of garbage, two bags of clothes she's never going ot wear again, half a bag of stuffed animals, two wal mart bags of recycling, and we are still not done cleaning and fixing up her room before the big fix up. Later on when every thing is painted and installed I plan on giving her a "seminar" on how to use space in a functional manner. I watch the show "clean Sweep" can you tell? It'll be nice to see her room all pretty. Although I have a feeling I'll be making my way down to her room in january or February (before her birthday and another onslaught of stuff, but just after christmas and the initial onslaught of stuff) to weed out more undesirables. I love my bethie but I pity her problem with pack rat assitis. Anthother bit I pity is the fact that she ends up with all the stuff her family doesn't have room for in her room. Her closet was full of other people's stuff. I fear what will happen when they go through their laundry room, or other wise known as the black hole! That room has a bag of mismatched socks in it from when beth was like five. It's really kind of scary. I don't know why they keep them. I have a theory that it may have somthing to do with a huge sock puppet festival they plan on throughing though. That must be it.     her sister's room got done up pretty well although I don't know how long she will like it for. The novilty hasn't worn off yet but it is VERY BLUE! I'm not using hyperbole here. That girl is going to be so sick of her room in a couple of years. Not that the rest of her furnature wouldn't be compatable with another colour of paint. I think that a green or purple, mauve, somthing like that would work very nicly and then the room wouldn't be crazy woman blue. That's what makes me feel really bad for Bethany though. Of course her sister is going to want her room. But I don't see the logic in that because Chelse made the choice of blue she should have to live with it. Just watch that will be turned around once Beth's mom decides that she will be the one stuck with all of the cblue furnature. I just don't see why Beth can't keep the stuff that is GIVEN to her. I just think it's her mother's way of detering any speak of leaving. on that note once the time comes when it is smartest for Beth to move I think her mom will come to her sences. I mean Beth plans on staying there for some time while she's still going to univercity. People change, so do oppinions.     On a lighter note. Bethie's mommy wants to take me with them to the Egypt exibit in Victoria! Apparently she wants me to go becasue I will be in comp civ with beth (and doing all of the projects with her) and Egypt is a huge unit in that class. I think the actual reason she wants to take me is because she gets bored without my random appearances, she has to book time with me. Speaking of that the reason I was at Beth's house... Her nother was bored. Apparently I have to be hanging out with beth for it to be ok for beth's mom to go to BINGO. I don't know what kind of reasoning that is but it doesn't really matter does it?     I got home and had some fun. I trye teaching genetics to my mother (basic) but she really doesn't get it. Kind of sad. She just can't figure out why I can't roll my tongue. So I tried explaining. Still didn't work. Well I guess it's just one of those things for her. Every body has "one of those things".      WOW I just figured out as to why it is my blog wouldn't let me do colour. I was on Edit... But why was I there? Hmmmm... I didn't click there... Well it's a mystery. At least I can do the colour thing now.
