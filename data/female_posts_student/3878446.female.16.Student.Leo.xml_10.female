I'm not even sure what exactly it is that i want to do with my life. I'm really interested in psychology, sociology, and philosophy; and I absolutly LOVE history, well European history anyways, and I was thinking about it and I would love to become and anthropologist and/or an archaeologist. A job that combines my interests into one, so I've been looking into Universities and colleges and I really find The University of Manchester interesting. I go to their web sote atleast once a day and am seriously thinking about possibly applying there. The only thing is I live in the US, Manchester is in the UK, it would be really hard for me to leave my family and friends and move to a whole new country, knowing there would be a possiblity that i wouldn't be able to raise the money for a plane ticket to go and visit them during holidays and what not. But I would absolutly love to live a new life, in a new place...get a fresh start. And I have always wanted to travel (especially to europe). I'm really starting to realize the fact that in order to get into a good college I need to do good in highschool, so this last semester as a sophmore I've really buckeled down and I'm getting into the habit of studying for tests intstead of just winging it, and I'm doing my homework so I can understand whats going on instead of just to get the grade. And now I find myself enjoying classes, and school is...well it's always been easy for me, but its easier. Wow, now I'm excited for school to start up again, lol. Now if you'll excuse me I have some College Research to do :-)
