Jen, you are incredible. really incredible. thank you so much. i love you.  I am feeling much better today. Tuesday sucked but it's over.  Right now we ar ein mazatlan and I am bored because all of my friends onboard are being lame and no one wants to get off the ship. So, I am just bored. I haven't even eaten lunch yet. I just got back from my cabin - I ate a package f sour candies that Jen sent me. Yummy! But I think I need some actual food though. I am pretty tired today as I had a late dinner with the penthouse guests and a very famous artist andher husband on board.  Manuel and I hosted the Captain's Club party and we were sitting with the last guests when they realized they had missed dinner. So, I called the chief housekeeper and had their butler bring a menu to the guests in the nightclub so they could order and have formal dining in their penthouse. He came, took the order and we went back to their penthouse and had some cocktails (additional cocktails). We sat there and drank and ate and had such good conversation. It was the greatest evening. I am tired though this morning. Whew! I didn't get back to my cabin until after 2:00AM.   Anyway, things have slowed down a lot for me lately since I don't have the groups anymore. It's awesome, I actually have some free time now. I am not printing any of m invitations anymore, just chilling back having dinners in penthouses, living it up. pretty fun now.   hope all is well. miss everyone. love you. happy v-day.
