So many emotions overwhelm me right now, I couldn't possibly describe them all. For starters, I feel like fucking shit. Simple. I had about 3 hours of sleep since last night/morning, I feel malnourished, and my arm hurts. I also feel like a used, general whore who trusts much too easily. I feel retarded, embarrassed and most of all stupid. I'm a stupid girl. A stupid brat. There were warning signs and I didn't properly acknowledge them, I guess? Well that isn't true, I did acknowledge them (see last posts), it's HIM that didn't do anything really.. I'm sick of being at the butt end of things and getting screwed over, blown off and abused by people who don't put in any effort to communicate or just act fucking mature in a situation. I'm sorry, but I expected a 21 year old with lots of girlfriend experience to have a little more communication skills then what was displayed last night. It was rude to just totally ignore me and go off with Danielle for the night. And that's just putting it simply, it was also hurtful, very hurtful. The only way I know how to describe this feeling is, heartbreak. I feel heartbroken. Apparently we're not right for each other and he wasn't feeling right or whatever... Well what the fuck, we talked on the internet while he was away, for like 4-5 hours at a time, getting to know each other. Maybe we jumped into sex too soon, but it was damn fun. I let him do things to me that I wouldn't just let any random guy do. I've never been tied up, I don't let just anyone go in my ass and I don't let just anyone cum in my mouth or all over my face. Jesus Christ... Honestly, I feel used...I feel like someone took advantage of my trusting and loving nature. Because it's true, I trusted him and I really like/d him. Even though we weren't in a relationship I enjoyed his company, I'm extremely attracted to him... and it killed me to watch him flirting it up with Danielle all night. I couldn't stand it. It was like knives slitting my wrists, coincidental? I was drunk, but that made it worse of course, my emotions started flying off the wall. But I know even if I was sober I would have been feeling the same way. I really thought he was interested in me and it made me so happy. I was so happy to have met someone I felt I could get close with and share something with. I've said it before, I'm god damn sick of emotionless relations with people. I want there to be something more then just sex, I want to meet someone new and be totally taken aback, like how it felt with Steph. Where all I wanted to do was kiss him and cuddle with him and enjoy him. Because I did. I'm not meaning to blame anyone, but I'm sure Danielle assisted in planting some message in his head that we were NOT good together.  But, sorry, ya know...Love isn't for everyone.
