This morning, when I woke up, I was in a horrible mood... I felt soo sick, and just not good at all.  But, last night, I agreed to go for a run with my brother this morning... so, he came to wake me up.  And yeh, we did go out,... but, it's so messed, because I couldn't run at all.  Well, in the beginning, we were running,... but, after that, I just couldn't do it.  My chest started hurting soo much,... I needed to lie down.  So, we weren't out for long.  We were out for about half an hour, and that's it... so, I came home and lay down.  Man, I need to go to the doctor's soon,... but, I really don't want to know what's wrong,... because, if I don't know, then I can always say it's nothing, right?  And then yeh, I went to school, earlier than I have in the past weeks... and, I went in to talk to Mr. Henderson, to apologize and explain myself to him, for missing his classes.  He understood,... and, I felt better after telling him.  And yeh, I   did   plan on going to his class... because we have a concert coming up this tuesday, and I haven't played for like, a month! So, I wanted to go... BUT, as I was walking to the class, I ran into Rukhie, and yeh, she's like, LET'S SKIP!  I didn't want to,... but, I've sayd before, I'd skip with her over going to class ANY day!  WHICH WAS STUPID ON MY BEHALF.  I talked to the teacher, and then I skip.  Retarded?! Just a little.  Then yeh, I ended up upsetting my boy, too... because normally after block d, I go to his class to pick him up... but, we ended up being late getting back to school, so I couldn't go to get him.  I know that I let him down, and I felt bad for that.  And, he was also kinda upset that I skipped, because I had asked him NOT to let me skip anymore, yet, I did it anyways.  *sigh* I'm not too smart, huh?  And then yeh, I went to math, feeling soo sick... and, I was just not in a good mood, and I think I kinda gave Roxie the wrong impression, as though she'd upset me, which wasn't the case at all.  But yeh, I told her that Gerardo wanted to talk to me at lunch,... and, I kinda figured that it was a bad thing, even tho he told me that it wasn't.  And then yes, I sat infront of my locker, waiting for him,... then Winnie came up and told me that he needed to stay in class to work on his project... so yeh, that got to me.  So, I decided to continue writing a letter to my mom, you know, just explaining things to her.  That's when I ran into Roxie and Luanne, and, Roxie's not stupid... she knew something was wrong... and yeh, I was ready to ball, but I figured that it'd be best if I didn't.  So, I started walking to the library so that I could write, and that's when I ran into Gerardo.  He didn't look to happy,... to be honest, he looked a little mad... so my thought was UH OH.  But yeh, I talked to him, and he told me what was on his mind,... and yeh, it's that he was upset that I skipped.  But yeh, lunch came and went, along with my last two classes... and then, IT POURED!  MAN, that was a lot of rain.  As we walked towards my house, my boy and I walked thru many puddles, altho, I did a lot more =) hehe.. But yeh, when I got home, Isaac wasn't feeling well... and, I also recieved a phone call from Roxie, and she was upset... and then I felt like hitting her boyfriend, but, I know I can't.  I know that he can be really sweet, and that he makes her happy... and, that's good for her... =)...  Mmmm... and then yeh, after I got off the phone with her, I went back to my room with Gerardo, and, outta no where, I just started crying.  Man, I don't know what's wrong with me.  Actually, everything probably is... There was no reason why I was crying... I guess, bottled up feelings were surfacing... I don't know. He got worried, but I told him that nothing was wrong... because, I couldn't really explain, cuz I didn't really know myself what was wrong.  But yeh, he ended up going home a little bit later... and now, here I sit,... writing this,... and, I realized that I've sayd a lot, and babbled on and on about my day, when really, it wasn't necessary.. but, oh well.  I'm not liking today,.. but, I guess days like today are inevitable.
