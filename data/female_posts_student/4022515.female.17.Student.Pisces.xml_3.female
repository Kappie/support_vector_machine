The thing is, I love kevin and being with him is the only thing that is important to me, and I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings in the process. you really are a great guy, but I love kevin. Of course we can still be friends.       I went shopping  today, and that made me very happy. I didn't get much, but I had a good sister bonding experience. I got a really cute blue and white shirt for $2.99 at fashion shop. Did you hear that? $2.99!! holy shit!! Its really soft, like a cross between velour and a beach towel. Its low cut too yay. I also got vanilla lip shimmer, mostly becuase kevin likes vanilla. Is that bad? I also got the worlds cutest sunglasses, they have little white flowers on the side with rinestones. Wahoo! I'll write more later, I'm going to eat dinner.
