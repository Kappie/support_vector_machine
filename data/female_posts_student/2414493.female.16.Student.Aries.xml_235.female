It's two conflicting desires: either I can pack it up now and get it over with and also know how much room I have left in my suitcase, or I can let it sit here until I have to leave for the airport tomorrow, and then I'll pack it.   I'm almost done putting stuff in order, which makes me happy.  Went to the driving range. I committed a few traffic crimes, though. Wasn't pleasant. It's unfamiliar driving my own designated car again.  I realize more and more why I'm not made for golf. Every shot counts.  I'm too tired to keep anything up.
