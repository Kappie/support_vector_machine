Angry Souls arent always  angry, but they cannot easily forgive and hold  grudges. You probably often get in fights with  your friends and family, and its difficult for  you to understand. When someone makes a  mistake, you dont let go easily and hold on to  those memories. Your very stubborn and your  rage is known to everyone. Though you never  actually mean it, you can say mean things in a  fight and go over board. Many people are  sometimes intimidated by your anger. But you  have many redeeming qualities and those are  that you are quite intelligent and smart. You  would make a good businesswoman or lawyer  because you know how to prove your point. You  cherish the ones around you, and appreciate  life, even though you can complain or throw a  tantrum now and then. The good things is, you  keep your emotions very outspoken, and are  normally a very happy person because all your  rage is let on the outside. Anger is simply a  state, but you, yourself as a person, are  great.     urlLink  What Kind of SOUL do you posses?
