In the song (Muhammad, my friend [from Boys from Pele--that's all the hints you're getting]).  A gay piano bar.  In London; her old stomping grounds.  It had to be the one.  We were afraid it would be so hip, so cool, so  her  that we'd only be able to leave a candle and our nose prints mashed up against the window.  We were right, but in all the wrong ways.    We should have brought a candle, but as a memorial.  We did leave our nose prints on the window, but only in an effort to see around the boards and drawn curtains.  We left feeling very sad, disbelieving and broken.  So we went to Harrod's.    Exactly three months later, I told her the story and she laughed kindly: "Yea, that's not it."  Dew Drop Inn is code for "Let's get the fuck outta here."  Simple mistake.  Anyway, that was also the day we roamed through Hyde Park, thinking about the next (potentially last) semester and the great unknown waiting.  Don't think I would have imagined a year later turning out like it has.  And that makes me smile.
