But knowing my luck...i`ll be worse haha. So Michelle layed out with me too for a bit. She never does that. haha. Me and her are getting along pretty well now  =)  not as if we didnt before, i was just saying. haha.  Me and Chelle are watching Nemo. lol. I just love this movie. I'm such a   big kid`!   haha. oh well.  I can't believe Pistons lost in overtime. i'm sooo mad about that`! i really   hate   the lakers! oh well. better luck next time haha.
