Thursday - nothing Friday - nothing. And that is next week planned out. Go me and my brilliant social life!  I thought yesterdays taser lessons were interesting. I am loking forward to the art and textiles courses although I was not impressed with the textiles taser. I mean, it was like being in a taster lesson for year 7. I sat there and weaved for 30 minutes. I mean, aaargh! Its so feminine! And sterotypical of women! Yes yes, I know its hard for the teachers to do taster lessons but still. And they were doing that typical thing teachers do "Oh how lovely!" next person "That looks nice!" next person "I like that colour". Argh! They don't actually mean the compliments!!!!!! EEEEEEEEEE! But anyways, histroy was amusing. Westy couldn't spell my name right, he did Nicky, Nickee and Nickie. Duh. NICKI. Geology was well, chaos because I had no idea what to do and felt stupid all over again so here we go back into the same old science routine of me being dumb. Art taster was great, I produced a nice chalk and charcol shell whcih I am rather pleased with and Miss Starky seemed to like it as well. English Lit I am really looking forward to. War literature and all. Engjoyed that. Amusing lesson.
