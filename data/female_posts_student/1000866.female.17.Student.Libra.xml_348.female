It seems almost like we had a two week vacation, like sophomore year ended two weeks ago. Summer went by SO fast. Today was alright. I don't really love any of my classes yet, but...eh. I have gym with people I know, which is nice. :) I'm trying not to think of Joanne at all. I'm making my mind completely avoid the topic.   I almost wanted to have homework tonight just to keep my mind off of everything that's going on right now.   Hmmmm....shall I wear shorts tomorrow? I don't know......I just don't want to have to do much thinking when I wake up, so...I'll do that now. You're a smart cookie Catie...heh heh, alliteration. Oh gosh, Carson and I counted the number of, "and that's." It was crazy...  And...since I'm being completely random, I think it's time for me to sleep....  Good night, good night...
