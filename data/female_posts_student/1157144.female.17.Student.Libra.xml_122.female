Seriously, there is some crazy ghetto Dawson's Creek crap going on in that web-journal-diary...  Do you honestly think that the people that say they are Aaron Carter are Aaron Carter?  I'd be curious to find out, in fact some little hoe-bag said something about them all lying.  Oh well?  C'est la vie! Note1: I am making an actual list of shizzle we can do when we go out.  I am tired of just driving...  It sucks like a porno star, so with that analogy clearly stated I would appreciate it if any person were to share their "enjoyable activities" they would like me to add to the list.  Okay?  Word my posse.  Oh, I just realized something...  Never turn porn on when your sister might be home...  Never.  Swear to god, I rarely look @ porn (i mean it to) and when I actually do, MY SISTER COMES HOME EARLY!  All those with siblings and who also enjoy a good self-hump...  Make sure your sister is not coming home early or you aren't coming home late (I would also like to add, i did not get caught!  THANK GOD FOR LOCKS ON DOORS THOUGH!) Note2: I do enjoy a good fast-food burger/hotdog/other fatty product, but I am seriously suggesting that perhaps we could eat @ a restaurant...  Maybe once every month?  And, since I did mention hotdog!  Weinershnitzel wasn't half bad.  I hated it for about 5 years, until...  When did we eat there again?  Oh well, it was okay. Note3: FUCK THE PO-LICE Note4: I think I am going to make a screen name up called: JASON_HATAKEYAMA ...  Comments?  Questions?  I'd appreciate all input!
