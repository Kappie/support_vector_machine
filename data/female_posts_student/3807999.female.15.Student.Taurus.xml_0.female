As usual, it's all pessimistic but then again that's the way I am; oh, and I don't like naming poetry, too hard...   why shall I love but never be loved? why must I know but never be heard? why must I care but am never cared about? why shall I see but never be seen, to look at the world as, truly, an individual, yet never given my individuality? respected my individuality? known about my individuality? why shall my initiative never be given a chance?  And why shall the world look, prejudge, close their eyes again, and live their lives blind?  'tis a true mystery   -- now the second one...  'Tis the ones who lack, they realise all the possibilities, the joys, the advantages, of owning a gift, talent, of mastering something easily, beautifully, 'Tis the ones who lack, who envy and want, yet who would never misuse, or abuse those things which they would so willingly take  'tis the ones who lack, 'tis the ones who try, put effort into their work, 'tis the ones who admire those gifts, talents, who would use them well, who rightfully deserve them
