It is true enough that if Al Gore had turned his attentions to states other than those in the South, he might gotten the electoral votes necessary to win the Presidency.  But Kerry seems to be forgetting that part of Gore's strategy in going after some of the states in the South that he did (Arkansas, Tennessee, Louisiana) was that Bill Clinton had been able to win them in  urlLink 1992  and  urlLink 1996 .  This is hardly ancient history.  Gore's problem in the South was not that he decided to campaign in these areas; it was that he was perceived not as from there and not as reflecting the ideals those voters were looking for, unlike Bill Clinton.  Gore tried to distance himself from Clinton, who was still an emmensly popular figure, and it was this that hurt him.   I think that Kerry is right:  the general trend in the South has been away from the Democrats and toward the Republicans.  But I think we'll need to see a couple of more election cycles before we completely write off Democratic hopefuls from winning the South.  If, say, the Democrats were to nominate John Edwards, I think a few states in the South would probably follow, and probably not at the expense of too many Northeastern states who would decide to vote against the Democrat - after all, who else are they going to support?  Mainly, what bothers me about this is not that he's said it or acknowledged it, because in certain respects he is most certainly stating aloud what many have thought or implied for a while.  But what is vaguely offensive is the rhetoric he employs.  He says:   "Everybody always makes the mistake of looking South...Al Gore proved he could have been President of the United States without winning one Southern state, including his own."   This is insulting language that seems to imply that, to him, the South doesn't matter.  And perhaps the South does not, or even should not, matter to John Kerry, for if he is to be President, he will likely have to become so without the support of a single Southern state (discounting Florida - mainly because it's not really Southern at all), because he is certainly not the type of Democrat the South will go for.  In other words, he is not Bill Clinton.  And while I normally find that to be a good thing, I think here it is not.  For he writes off an entire region of the country because it will not be supporting him in his bid for the Presidency.  And while that may be realistic of him, it certainly isn't very Presidential.
