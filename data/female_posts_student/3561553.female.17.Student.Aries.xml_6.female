I did something with Troy friday, that was cool... we watched A Knights Tale and we i dont remember what else we did, then Saturday i had to work all day which sucked because i hate work and taking the goddamn bus, the night was better though because i got to do something with Troy, but it was kinda gay cuz we went to his house and when were at his house he wont even like lye close to me or touch me at all... (no not just like that... perverts) i mean cuddle and stuff like we normally do. Today suckkked so bad, i had to work all day which sucked then i only got a $96 paycheck which sucked, then i came home and did h/w all night which was gay as well...   Life sucks... Me and troy still arent going out, its been like 7 months, he confuses me though, he acts exactly as if we were going out, we do everything we did when we were going out (with 1 exception)... so yeah i dont really know what i wanna do... i hate being single it sucks. I want to move on but after a year and 1/2 of being together almost everyday, yeah thats kinda hard.   Bleh neways... gotta go finish all the fuckin projects assigned last minute... GRRR i hate mrs. Jacobson!!!
