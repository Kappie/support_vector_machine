It's soooo crazy, expensive but convienent on one, takes forever but cheap for another. Right now, on my way to Winnipeg, I stop in Vancouver for an hour, and two in Calgary. I leave Victoria at 9.15. I get there at 13.55 or something. It's soooo maddening! I need all my friends to move to Calgary for a day, and hang out with me in the airport:P  Oh well.   urlLink Photos.   urlLink Blog.   urlLink Site/Poetry.
