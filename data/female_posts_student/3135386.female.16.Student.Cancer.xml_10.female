I can't say Carlos is an ugly banga...*laughs* Brincando Carlos!   On another note, guess who's been bungee jumping. Yes, that's right, yours truely! Hehehe... On Thursday I believe, Me, Lucas, Bruno, Maria-Julia and her dad all went to SÃ£o Paulo, a full day's drive away. (About the same distance as Edmonton is from home)   On friday we drove to Hopi Hari, an amusement park about an hour away from the hotel. There, I (the girl who before was afraid of elevators....*laughs*) Went on a rollarcoster twice.I went on this ride that takes you three storeys up into the air, and makes you do summersaults over and over again. I went on this thing called the Eiffel Tower that takes you up 23 stories, then drops you. I've been on rides that make me feel like I'm a moracca. (sp?) And then, I've been bungee jumping...   Maju, Bruno and Iwalked to the otherside of the amusement park, and paid for this ride.  Strange , I thought to myself.  Haven't we already paid?  Maju asks if I want to go on and I say sure, why not. We go around to the back of the building, and we have to wait in this room. Stupidly, I ask, "So what are we doing?" She looks at me as if I've sprouted another head, and says "OMG...you don't know!? We're going bungee jumping!"   Me: "Oh. Right then." I sit down to wacth Charlie's Angels on the tv, and the whole time I was thinking...wow, in 10 mins, we're going to be doing that. (as they fly through the air)   It was amazing!Well, I don't think it was bungee jumping exactly, but I didn't know what else to call it. Close enough, you go ridiculous heights in the air, to fall the the ground secured only by a bit of cloth and rope and suddenly you're a pendulum going back and forth. It was so cool, the best part of the trip!--but I stil don't think I'll be doing it again any time soon. ^_^   Went on some more rides and then went to get something to eat at McDonalds. I"ve been to more McDonalds since I've been in Brasil, then I ever have before in my life. *laughs* I'm going to be so fat when I go home.   Got home at about 6pm yesterday (Sunday) evening. Phoned up dad, and then spoke to Steph amdMatt on MSN for a bit. A big group of us went out to Mecena's Bar at 10:30pm and stayed until just after 1am. It's was pretty good, I listened/tried to dance (It was so crowded!) to pagode music, saw one drunk guy trying to Samba (I think, he looked like he was doing the funky chicken) and otherwise, had a lot of fun. My first time going to a club. *nods* Cool.   Neh, going to go upload some more pics now.
