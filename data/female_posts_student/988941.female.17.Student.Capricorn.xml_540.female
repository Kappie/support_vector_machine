The first bit was that Michelle didn't have a calaculator in the science exam today. Then this bit is to do with Jackie. It was  that day  in July and when the four of us got off the bus at  the destination  the other two circle of love members managed to rush off into  the lines  and we totally lost them. Hmm. It does not bode well hey? Well I am wetting myself about the science exam today. I will probablty be really depressed on my departure of the exam hall. Wopee. Althouogh I am looking forward to Thursday where Jackie and I will be shopping with the circle of love. That should be fun. Very fun. If you know what I mean Jackie. The group can bond. Heehee. Well, the internet is kinda boring lately although I have taken greatly to  urlLink faceparty.com . That is rather fun. I will also be getting my own domain in a few weeks which should be good.
