Of course, it was to be expected, but I'm a completely different case, so I halfway hoped, in some desperate fashion, that not setting an alarm and still managing to get up at 10 after not having slept for a week would still come to fact somehow. Realistically, I'm fine, as I don't really have to go anywhere today. However, I finally crashed at around 3.00 am (first stupid move) and awoke at 2.00 pm although I lay there for 40 solid minutes. Therefore, my head now hurts beyond belief, and most of the day is already gone. I need to do a bit of cleaning and then get working on chemistry, calculus, and some applications. Mech.    Yesterday was an odd day. I shan't put a negative nor positive connotation to it. I suppose that the highlight involved kicking some major Tekken Tag butt, but then Lyndsey beat me at SC II by a few matches, an event which caused me to release the week's exasperations into hapless shrieking. While the aforementioned served the purpose of stress-relief well, it wasn't a very smart thing for me to do, as my throat is now very sore, and I need to get working on All State music, apart from the fact that I have to sing at least 90 minutes daily.    I'm just glad I'm not at school right now. As you may imagine, the ever-so-strong hatred for NHS persists. Well, I suppose I should go grab some form of aliment and go from there. Er, song... Well, listening to it now, and it's good, so   "Loser" by Beck    In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie with the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose kill the headlights and put it in neutral stock car flamin with a loser and the cruise control baby's in Reno with the vitamin D got a couple of couches, sleep on the love seat someone came in sayin I'm insane to complain about a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt don't believe everything that you breathe you get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve so shave your face with some mase in the dark savin all your food stamps and burnin down the trailer park Yo. Cut it.  Soy unperdedor I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me? Soy un perdedor I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?  Forces of evil on  a bozo nightmare ban all the music with a phony gas chamber cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag one's on the pole, shove the other in a bag with the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job the daytime crap of the folksinger slob he hung himself with a guitar string a slab of turkey-neck and it's hangin from a pigeon wing you can't write if you can't relate trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate and my time is a piece of wax fallin on a termite that's chokin on the splinters  Soy un perdedor I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me? (get crazy with the cheese whiz) Soy un perdedor I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me? (drive-by body-pierce) (yo bring it on down) sooooooooy... (I'm a driver, I'm a winner; things are gonna change I can feel it) Soy un perdedor I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me? (I can't believe you) Soy un perdedor I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me? Soy un perdedor I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me? (Schprechen sie Deutches, baby) Soy un perdedor I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me? (Know what I'm sayin?)
