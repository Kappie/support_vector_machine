ACK!! and he's CANADIAN!! I AM IN LOVE. i have found my one true love. *faints*   whoa. what happened? why am i on the ground. *correction* why was i on the ground? lol. anywyas, today was a ton of fun. i awoke around 10:00 and went downstairs to see my mom stripping the walls of the wallpaper. i helped her do that for a bit, then i went on the computer. after that i got sent outside to remove those fake lines from the 4 big windows on the front of our house. i also had to was the windows clean. that took me like 3 hours. and then in the middle of me doing that, jorge, leanna, and ra-ool came by. ra-ool n jorge started stripping the paint off the lil spindle railing thingy in the front of the house. oh yeah, and leanna threaded jorge's unibrow away. haha. jk. aww, no more visor! =P after that we washed the van. then i showered and then mom cooked pasta and egg rolls and leanna and i did ra-ool's hair. then we ate. after that, we all went to the movies. we watched "the notebook" and that is how i have found out that i love ryan gosling. after that, ra-ool n jorge left coz ra-ool has work tomoro and jorge has school. me and leanna snuck into shrek 2, and i think i have set a personal record: i saw shrek 2 three times in theaters, twice were sneak-ins, once i paid. yup. shrek 2 is hilarious. gotta luv it. besides. dont you think going to the theaters for $10.95 should be worth at least 2 movies? at least im getting my moneys worth. =P anyways. i got home minutes before 12 and i had a good day. today was fun. washing windows, sneaking into movies, and yeah. i think i should work on my french 11 course sometime soon. maybe tonight? hah. i think not. perhaps another day, try..... a few weeks from now? lol. i think i might play spyro tonight. perhaps i shall, perhaps i shan't. i am very indecisive, one thing i do know though, i write too much. ciao for now.
