Today my stomach has been incredibly acidic. I took some Aleve for pain relief, and though it worked marvelously, it was also so strong that my stomach's been acidic all day. I ate two lunches and ate more when I came home as well as drank lots of milk in attempt to neutralize it a bit, and my stomach's still burning. It's just as though I were throwing wood in fire.  And now, for the total release:  WHAT IN THE FRYING FISHSTICKS ARE THESE PEOPLE TRYING TO DO TO ME!?!?!?!?!?!?!!!!!!!!  Festival next week.  a) We'll suck b) I'll have to miss all of the school day except first block on the day right before exams begin c) I'll very likely have to come home really late and pull an all nighter for the calculus exam d) The week after, I really don't feel like finishing this post anymore.   Quote of the day:  "Fran! Don't let the acid get to your head!!" --Kim (in choir, as I griped about my acidic stomach)    "Cigarette" by Yellowcard  Watching the days burning out like a cigarette, just a few drags to go You built me up and you broke me down, somehow Everything just seemed so clear to me, nothing left to know I'll love you right and i'll love you pure, right now  How can you say that it's too late To save us now  And I would wait for you if you would wait for me And I will wait for you if you will wait for me  Intoxicated, the edge is serrated, so easily torn from the core I blushed the first time, but you blushed the last time my eyes hit your mind Regenerated these feelings of hatred, I long for your love ever more You built me up and you broke me down this time
