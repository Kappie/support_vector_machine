Cos seriously I have no idea! Anna said that it might be radiation (we were in physics at the time) but thats not possible cos I am not exposed to excessive radiation! : )  RANDOM HAPPINESS! I need an answer!!!! its driving me nutty. there is only one time that i can remember feeling like this and that was, like, about 2 years ago, i think summer 2002 if you can remember what happened then. if not i will not explain because you were probably one of the only people that wasn't told about my little secret. : )    : )    : )    : )  hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!!!! cya xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx : )
