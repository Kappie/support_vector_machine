I hate all of this stress and tension. I hate making people sad and it just shows that im only around to cause harm. I should have a warning label saying:CAUTION:emotionally disturbed don't mess with me.    Why am I even here?...Almost everyone i know has hurt me in some way. I hope ryan understands..i don't expect him to but i feel so bad. I need to curl up into a corner and cry...but I have no tears left,im completely out.    Francesca has had so many friends commit suicide that if one more,including me, does it she'll deffinately go crazy. I mean...(i really shouldn't be sayin this) she used to cut herself, i dont' know if she still does but, I looked on her arms to look at alla her bracelets she had on and, there were just a bunch of healed scars. I looked at her like what the f*** and she just smiled and said'u should see the marks on my waist' i was so angry,but she kinda gave me ideas but i don't think cutting yourself will do any good. Just causes more pain...some ppl cut because they feel numb and they have no emotion so they cut so they can feel pain. Others cut to punish themselves, some cut for fun(dumbasses), and others just are so depressed taht all they wanna do to occupy their time is cut.(that would be me) But see, my aunt is dying because she cuts. Supposedly she's doing better which is GREAT but, i don't want to follow in her footsteps.   I try to take a walk or listen to music to get all of my emotions out. I don't want anyone of my friends to hurt themselves. But...then why do i want to hurt myself? So confusing.      To top it all of i think today will be awkward...I'm goin to Festival Bay with ryan and i think hes mad at me. But hopefully we'll have fun and get through it. I'm looking forward to talking with him. He knows whats going on with me..but not the whole story.   Elizabeth also knows whats going on but its just part of whats happening. If anyone talks to her on AOL she'll just say to figure it out yourself so i wouldn't bother lol. She knows that im upset about DP..which the audition would be today and she knows that im sad. Jeeze im so messed up right now i don't know what todo with myself.    In song.~
