Maybe you don't remember that?   That you were that light.   You were.   I wanted to make it work, don't think that we didn't try.   We did,  I did and you did.   We tried and it didn't, Cabe,  and I need to pull away now and try to seal myself off so maybe I wont seep back into the place I used to be.   It kills me to read the words there.   That I could hurt you so much is a cold slap to me,  but if I try to make it better for you I make it worse for me.
