JB said he wanted to be gone by saturday. AJ said he didn't want to stay either. R? said this was her last week too. i think once everyone realized that 5 out of 8 of the night crew were leaving, well hell with it lets just all go now! there was talk of a big walkout, but since there is not a night that we all work together- it would be kinda silly. somewhere along the way we just decided that we just would simply not go back.  the remaining employees are: one bartender, a recently demoted cook, the dayshift waitress, and three new waitresses. they are not so happy about it, but they understand. or if they don't, they will, very soon.  it is sad too. we have all put so much into making this work. i hope one of the old owners opens another bar, like today. i have never worked with a better cast of characters, never enjoyed my job so much (until recently obviously..) i wish we could walk into another bar together. "hire all of us, because we are a great team, and we have our own clientele!"  we are having a celebratory booze fest this friday night, at another local-ish pub. i am pretty sure we will drink them out of lonestar, cheap bourbon, and monopolowa. the legend continues...  long live the punchy's in all of us.
