BTW, Sylv, I haven't got a copy of the Religion assessment, so could you please either photocopy it for me, or give it to me to photocopy? Thankies heaps. Dreading an essay I have to do during English tomorrow.. English has become so gay lately..am I right or am I right? Oh well, at least it's better than being at Technicorp.. *shudders at the thought*      Argh fook... I just wrecked my avatar on a forum... Photobucket resized it twice, so you'll need a frickin' microscope to see it... Fookin' hell!!!      Just wanna say have fun on your Geo excursion tomorrow, Carah, Sylv T and Millie!! And can't wait to see your pierced ears tomorrow, Kaz!!! =oD
