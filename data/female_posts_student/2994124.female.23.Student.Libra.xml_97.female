Melanie and I were having a nice chat the other day, when I asked the simple question of whether when we speak on the phone it goes up to a satellite of under the ocean, to which Melanie replied horrifidly - you're kidding right?! So this has sparked many a discussion over here. Some say that it goes under the ocean, others that it goes via satellite (as in satellite communication) but which is it? There used to be a time delay when you phoned over to your continent, but that no longer exists. Surely if it is going all the way under the ocean there would still be a delay? Melanie said she watched this programme about how they laid the cables under the ocean, but I'm not convinced. So tell me which it is - and I NEED evidence to prove it.   So my week has been pretty uneventful. Work,kids,sleep and then work. Cycled into town along the canal on Saturday (did you know that Birmingham has more canal mileage than Venice?!) but it was heaving because the sales had just started. I hate it when its like that. So I hid out in the library.   Sunday I took a trip to Kidderminster which is about an hour away from Birmingham, and involves driving through these lovely little quaint villages. My housemate Sara was there on a weekend away and fell hill-boarding and so couldn't drive home. So Mark and I drove there and I drove her car back. (See Melanie some people trust me to drive their car!!   cup of tea!  ) We then went to church where we had a leaving service because our 2 curates (they are husband and wife and jobshare!), the music director and the warden are all leaving. Was a hilarious evening ending up with the vicar and associate vicar being custard pie-d!!!  So tomorrow I'm heading home for about 24 hours before driving down to Bognor Regis (yes the place is as bad as it sounds!) for a Scripture Union kids camp I'm doing for about 10 days. So no more blogging over that time I'm afraid. But the Arbarbanels are back so they can take over for a bit!  So take care guys, enjoy your summer in Canada (we are still on autumn here - yes get the violins out)  k xx
