Thank you Dial up for that, and Jackie is mad at me for some reason and is not answering her cell phone. I would like to say that I would really like to talk to Spinner, so I know Jackie may be mad, but that is no reason to keep old friends away from each other. Once again, narrowband has caused anguish in the world.
