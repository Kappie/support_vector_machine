And considering I was out pretty late last night, totaly excusable.  But oh man, after the movie last night we drove to the Maumee River and tried (ha) to make a bonfire. That didn't really pan out, so we ended up just sitting in the dark and watching the stars. It was so beautiful. The ripples on the river reflected the stars in the sky and the sounds of all the wild things nearby. Very peacful. It was funny to see everyone in their make shift Lort Of The Rings costume. It really was a spur of the moment thing, so none of ours was that great. I'd have to say Rob's was the best. But still, I've never seen the stars that well in Ohio. It's funny how you can look to the stars for hours on end, and never get bored. Something about them just makes you...think.   Well I'm gonna go have some lunch. ~Your own personal starry eye dreamer
