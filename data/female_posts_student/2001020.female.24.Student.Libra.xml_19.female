But I'm going to dinner with a really cool guy (who I sorta have a closet crush on), so that's a nice way to start the weekend. I'm doing alright, all things considered. Been feeling a little more at ease with things, although graduation is coming up and I have been finding my thoughts resting on him. However, it's been almost a week, and I have no urge to call him, which is completely miraculous to me. I'm proud of myself in that sense, though. I am going to be able to pull through this, and I'm proving it to myself daily. I've been a little down in the dumps this past week, I will admit, but I'm taking it one day at a time and trying to forget that my job sucks and just look forward to the new life I have ahead of me in law school. I've been feeling a little cute lately, which is also good for the ego. Well, anyway, enough of that. Later!
