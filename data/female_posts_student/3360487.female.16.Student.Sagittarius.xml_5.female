But now I have to do about 5 AP biology assignments, study for my History and English finals, and makeup some AP compsci work.  We got a really cool robot vaccuum cleaner that looks like a UFO and just glides around the floor and cleans everything.  It's really neat and my dog is really afraid of it.  Hahahaha.  I really want a Gmail account.
