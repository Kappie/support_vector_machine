I hate people so much that i can't stand it. All through Badminton there was atleast one tear rolling down my cheak, i had to show myself to erin and Jenny, i had to show  myself being so very weak. What happened? people did, people who think they are sooo much better than me just because i'm different, just because i believe in different things, just because i questioned life, i questioned what most people around me take for granted. They got what they wanted, they made me feel like crap, they made me cry, they made me question where the nearest bridge is.....   Rhedyn "Nevermore"
