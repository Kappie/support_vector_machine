I just want him to be the one to ask me out. I had to do it a lot of times. I regret dumping him. I only dumped him because life was getting a little tough for me and I couldn't carry having a boyfriend. Especially because I was being a jerk to him and he was getting mad at me. I want to take everything back! I really do!
