College. i dont know what i want to do. If i try to become an optometrist...i'll have to take all these chemistry and math courses. can you imagine? me in a chemistry class. and here alanah is telling me to plug the god damn heater in to the outlet after 10 minutes. Am i stupid? i feel like i am sometimes. i dont know if i'm cut out to be an optometrist. i mean, i'd love to do it. and i thought about it, and i really would like to do it. I'm for it, i just dont know if it's for me. and i get this sick nauseous feeling, that if i let go of being an optometrist, i'll definatly be left standing here with nothing at all. and i dont think i could stand that. I've always had something to hold on to. keep me standing, and even just thinking i knew what i wanted to do was that little comfort i needed. but its turned into a dread. I'm not as good as all these ppl around me. I guess im not as smart. i mean, wtf, becky everyday in W. history talks about having a 97 in Chemistry AP. Studies for a few minutes throughout the day for W history and gets 86's. " I like history, its easy for me!" FUCK YOU! i love it too! Why can't i make a 96 on every test then!!? and all my friends are going to this SAT prep class, Nation Merit thing, and alanah's going to take a SAT class. i can't i dont have  time . then how am i going to do good on it? i didn't get as good as all these ppl on the Psat. ya sure- ok it doesn't all that matter. but then what does. i just feel like i'm slipping
