However, I'm tired, so I'll be creative with the blog later...  I am ready to once and for all be myself!  I am breaking out of this little bubble I've built around myself for so many years.  In 3rd grade when I started gaining weight, I just started to sink down into myself and try my hardest to go unnoticed.  I don't do that anymore obviously, but I still have the tendency NOT to grant myself the freedom to be the person that will make me happy.  I'm making some drastic changes in the way I see myself.
