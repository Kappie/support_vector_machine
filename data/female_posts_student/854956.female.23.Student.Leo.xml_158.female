The week at work went by really fast... but of course now that only means that classes start Monday.  :-\  I'm really not feeling like going back to classes so soon!  On the upside, Melissa and Amy both let me know that Barenaked Ladies are going to be in Austin March 10.  This is awesome!  I haven't seen them in like, 4 years... and I'm PSYCHED!  Call it a guilty pleasure, but the music is awesome, and they are awesome live!  :-D  So, I have that to look forward to.    This is all I really feel like posting right now... but please take note of the map thing I have... The frog that's doing excersises (On the  LEFT side column ) has several things above him.   The second linking box above him is where you can place a pin on a map to tell me where you are... and I'd love it SO MUCH if you would place a pin on there letting me know where you're from...!  :-D
