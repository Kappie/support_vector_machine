"so unhappy with myself i would change but the walls are too thin everyone would hear my pain but feel no sympathy only digust.  so unhappy with him but nowhere to vent there's no room left on my wrists too many other boys have taken up residency there. but i'm not unhappy with him when i'm with him, that is to say. his face suddenly makes everything so much better but his actions do so much damage cause so much hurt and when i fall, i fall hard and i'm obviously smitten I just want to be loved.  I just wanna be happy."
