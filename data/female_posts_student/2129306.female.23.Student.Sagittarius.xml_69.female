Vernon today-have a lot of work to catch up on.  But while I'm wasting time, I'll fill in the trip details.     Wednesday  Left Centralia around 5 p.m. after Victoria successfully arrived, w/o getting lost-I DON'T live in the boondocks despite what people may think.  Stopped in Carbondale @ the SIU-C campus for dinner at one of my favorite places down there, Pagali's-it's an old college haunt of my parents, and I probably love it as much as they do-it has the best pizza in the world.  Move over, Papa Del's.  (not that I was ever much of a Papa Del's fan...but folks in Chambana seem to think it's the greatest, whereas I do not)  So that took about an hour and a half, but once back on the road I drove the speedy route through Missouri which brought us into Millington (right outside Memphis) around 11 p.m.  Chatting w/ my grandparents was promptly followed by much-needed sleep.     Thursday  Pancakes, followed by a trip to the Galleria, which was cut short as I found I had a flat tire leaving my grandparent's driveway...after a walk back to my grandparent's, my grandfather helped us fix the tire and V got her first glimpse of southern hospitality when one of the neighbors came by and helped my grandfather fix it.  Finally, after purchasing a new tire, we got to the Galleria, where I purchased an uber-cute shirt and some salon products.  After shopping, we headed back into Millington to eat dinner, and then explored downtown Memphis for the better part of the evening.     Friday  Elvis' home, (Graceland) and random souvenir shopping, followed by an evening in Tunica, Mississippi-the Vegas of the south.  On the way to Tunica, V commented on the fact that my accent had grown increasingly southern in our short time down there, but I explained to her that this happens whenever I visit, seeing as my grandparents have strong accents.  Since we didn't want to waste a lot of money, V and I made it our duty to collect coin cups from every casino we went to, and ended up not spending that much money but having fun.  Between the complimentary drinks and flashing lights, it was an entertaining evening.   Saturday  Wal-Mart, Galleria, Peabody Ducks (if you're unsure what I'm talking about, ask me sometime about them...) and Rendezvous-the best bbq joint the world has ever known.  Wanted to spend some time on Beale street, but thanks to the rain, it was nearly impossible.  Other than Saturday night, the weather was absolutely beautiful.     Sunday  Church, luncheon w/ my grandparents, then headed back to C-town, making extremely good time, upon arrival, V headed back to Chambana.  And that was spring break!   I'll write more later.  Until then, I have much to work on before this week is over. Later gang!
