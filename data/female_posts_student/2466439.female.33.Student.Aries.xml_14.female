I'm used to just dropping everything whenever she needs something, and I don't think that's a good idea.  There always seems to be a good reason to do it.  It always seems temporary.  She's quitting smoking.  She's got a big test.  She's got mono.  She hasn't eaten dinner.  But I'm starting to get a little tired of taking care of her.  It's not that she doesn't take care of me, because she does.  She's really sweet about it, actually.  I think she's really conscious of what I do for her and she doesn't want it to be one-sided.  Still, I have days where I get tired.  Sometimes I have stressful days that aren't quite stressful enough because they get subsumed in her greater stress.  Argh.  I also don't know what to be when I grow up, but that's another issue.  I'm sad that Dean doesn't seem to be doing so well.  I wonder what the hell he did to piss off the media so much.  He's just not all that liberal.  Of course, it doesn't take much to be a radical in our society, at least if you lean left.
