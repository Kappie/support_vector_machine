Pity, since there's no other song that is able to fit with how I'm feeling now. The room, being in an even untidier mess than it was before, still laid untouched, even I don't even know when I'm going to clear it. Least it doesn't matter what state it's in any way. Smoke arising, swirling in neat white circles, the lit object stayed where it was, as I flung my head back against the computer chair and wondered.      Wondered where the hell I am and who the hell I am.      Recounting all incidents that had happened so far from the start of secondary school, it makes me wonder just what destiny is playing around with me. Throughout my life, how many times have I brushed with the school rules and Death? How near could I get to the Law as well? How near am I really to even standing up to the school? Funny though, how I'm viewed by people so weirdly throughout all these years. All these four years to be exact.      I hate this.      It hurts to even think about where I'm drifting from and drifting to into the future, so much so I have given up on it. Nanashi wanted comfort though, even when all of us; me, Shinigami, Tenshi and Nanashi Shinigami, all decided that we would rather keep it bottled to ourselves. Great action though, thanks to Nanashi, now people in the school may start thinking that 'we' aim for people of the same gender. Heck...I'm straight, and so is the rest, though what goes on on their minds amuses me sometimes too.    Man, am I weak indeed...    One more chance. I have decided to put all my bet on this last chance. Though what outcome may occur, I am not sure, but Nanashi and I decided that it would be best if we gave them a chance. The Fuhrer isn't the highest rank you know, it's the people who are of the bottom rank which are the highest. Only time will tell, I guess, though how long a time, I have no idea.       No idea at all...    Though something tells me truly...      I would not like this ending afterall...
