It was funny though cos another newsie-person took my paperbag with keys and money in it by accident, and me and my scary friend had to go out on our bikes and find him so i could get my bag back and go home! And I've spent the rest of today doing nothing....woopeee-doooooo...tra-la-laaaaa pom-pom twiddlie-woddle...
