The credit card situation is immaterial now, as it's pretty much under control.  I'm still awfully pissed at myself every time i make out a big fat check to credit counseling instead of a Volkswagen dealership.  But the driving...  I am terrified of four things: slugs, clowns, stepping down from high places, and driving.  The first three aren't that important unless I'm in the basement of my old house, watching IT, or hanging Christmas lights.  The driving thing is pretty unavoidable, and I end up scaring myself to death at least 4-5 times a day.    I was in a fender bender a couple of months ago, which I didn't think too much of until last week.  I got a call from my insurance lady, who told me my insurance had risen from $600 a year to $1600.  Apparently my "undesirable record of traffic offenses" had put me in the worst offender category of driver.  If I'm in one more wreck before 2006, I'm uninsurable.    The thing is, I'm NOT really a bad driver.  I drive like an 82 year old man on his way to the Western Sizzlin' for Tuesday coffee.  The only time I had ever REALLY sped on the highway was for an emergency, and it was also the only time I've ever gotten a ticket.  Two of my traffic accidents were in parking lots where the person I hit was either parked illegally or crowding the white lines.  I even tracked down one of those guys just to tell him I had scratched his car and to give him my insurance.  He fucking cried, CRIED, over his Olive Garden tortellini because I was so honest.  My reward?  A $700 insurance claim for a whole new bumper.    One of the other offenses on my record was a wreck  my mother  got into.  I wasn't even in the same town when it happened, but it still goes on my record since I was a dependant in 1999.  Is that even legal?  I've decided, henceforth, to learn how to ride a bike and navigate the mean streets of College Town, USA.  I hear if you get hit by a driver in a University crosswalk, you automatically get $5,000 and free tuition.  If I play my cards right, maybe I can actually pay my insurance.
