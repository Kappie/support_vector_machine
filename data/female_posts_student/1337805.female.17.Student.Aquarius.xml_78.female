I still don't know where we stand, and I hope it just doesn't turn out to be a majorly sexual thing, cause that's not just want I want. I want the real stuff too. It means a lot to me. So PEH. Yes, Anyways. On Friday I'll get to see him for the first time in two weeks...It'll be wild. I'm also getting tired of hiding this thing too. I have a very good feeling that by friday, and greg's big mouth, the cat will be out, and we'll have jumped out of the closest. Hey look everyone, I'm going out with Tom....  Yes. On that note, I made myself the sexyest shirt out of an old pair of jeans of mine. It's so nice, it's kinda bad tho, cause you can just undo the entire shirt by a simple snap of the wrist....I normally wear a tank underneath, to discourage people, but not on Friday...:P Daaaaaangerous.   Biked down to the Tim Hortons in Gordon Head today. Only took about 45 minutes too. Wild. I need a back rub now, mine hurts.  I'm tired, sore and slightly wanting a certain male badly. Must...leave!
