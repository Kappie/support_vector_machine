The reality of it all 	Will never quite sink in. You never know the time 	Of the beginning or the end. The world as we know it 	Is not a silly game. You don’t run a race 	Finish last and win the fame. So this is what you do 	And this is what you say. Grab the world by its ears 	And say “I’ll never fade.”
