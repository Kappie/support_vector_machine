Check it out at http://...I'll just go find out...*cough* http://www.nailsea.nsomerset.sch.uk they found another gas leak or something! Oh no, that's not it...they're replacing some of the old humanities stuff and it'll be fixed Tuesday afternoon! So don't go to school! Well, you can if you want to but I won't be! Oh and Izzy I don't play dumb. (Hey, stop putting yourself down!) I get paid to.
