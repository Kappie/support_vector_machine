It drew me back into the world of my childhood and car trips at night.  Ever since I was a toddler sitting still and quiet has been a problem, but for some reason watching the moon through a window has been a tranquilizer.  I remember asking my parents why the moon followed us and they just laughed it off and said that it was the curve of the earth or some logical thing like that.  Back then I didn't believe them and I still don't.  Sitting in my car with gorgeous music flowing from my speakers, I swear the moon was watching me.  Driving on the beltline at night always scares me, but I felt better with the moon watching.  It stayed positioned in the top left hand corner of my windshield as if glued to the spot the entire way. Every once and a while its nice to know that something, even if its only the man on the moon, is watching my back.
