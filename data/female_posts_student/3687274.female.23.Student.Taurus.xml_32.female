I have absolutely nothing of importance to say about my life.  But Robin is turning 25 in ten days. It's about that time again people! Celebrate good times, come on! Well, I don't exactly know what we are going to do for Robin's birthday, just yet. But I hope it involves alcohol, melted candle wax and sweaty man-body. Yeah, that would be fun.  I get to flirt with my cute guy again on Friday. Just to let you guys know. I'm not going to ask him out or anything. Robin said I should play with him a little more. Andonce I get him hooked then I can go in for the kill. If he decides to give up then I'll know he wasn'tright forme.Riiight? Right!! Sometimes I think it would be pointless to be in a relationship right nowanyway. I have a lot of more important things in my life. School. My family and friends. Bills.Yeah, all importantstuff. Bringingin a guywould be like bringing in achild. Only you can't lock this one in a closet because by all rights and purposes he should be at least half a foot taller than you and weigh a good 30lbs more than you. (For any of youwho didn't know this I read it in this book called...um...short..girliemen...and the women who ...shouldbe skinned alive, thenbeatwith a switch for loving them. That soundsgood right?) What was I talking about?? Well, I'm gonna gosmoke a little and trytostay awake.  I hope you guys have a good day tomorrow. Cause I know I will. You know what I just realized!!! These people left me alone in this place with the hanger doors open.Something could walk in here and eat me. WHOLE. Well, like half of me, then if it didn't choke to death, the other half. Just put yourselves in my shoes for a moment.  Damn people.Leaving these damn doors open like they ain't go no sense. (Tracybaconfat. Tracy. Bacon. Fat. TRACYBACONFAAAAAATuh!!!) Just felt like loving one of my friends.
