In the morning they were giving out those hershey kisses so I had some and then in Bio I had a chocolate cookie, then in English Megz was like "hey, want to share smarties" so I had some of those, and then when I was leaving school they gave out more chocolate.  OK so yeah you would think that is the end of my lovely I-ate-chocolate-all-day-story but nope it goes on.  So then I got soup and a sandwich at tims and I got the combo that comes with coffee, but I didn't want coffee so I got hot chocolate.  Then I don't have any idea why I ate dinner last night cause I wasn't hungry but I think I was just emotionally eating.  So yeah I ate like yogurt, a granola bar, crackers w/ peanut butter, and a plate of chile.  Yeah ok so that is it right - nope.  Then after I drove to my sisters and stuff and picked up their clothes I drove to timmy's cause my mom wanted to get a gift certificate and some tea and so I got a donut - with chocolate on the top.  It was my first time driving through the drive through too!  Then I want through Wendy's drive through and got some lemonade and I saw Edi there.  I really have to cut back on the chocolate though.  I was doing so good eating healthy and then my bad habits just creeped back.  I can just try again though.  It's been hard with the rehearsals for the play though because I have been eating bigger lunches cause we got during the week 4:00-6:00 and friday 2:30 - 4:30, next thurs we get off early and so I think he said we are going from 12:30 - 2:30.  Then Edi came over after work and we talked for like four hours.  Everything was going good until his kiss.  I mean c'mon it was first kiss.  To be honest it was not enjoyable at all.  It was totally disgusting.  I expected a little kiss on the lips, but he like sucked the bloodly life out of me.  When he started kissing me her was like trying to like get his tongue in my mouth or something.  It was nasty.  I had a vision of a reptile kissing me.  I called it "the lizard kiss" cause it literally was like kissing some lizard trying to like get my tounge.  I finished my homework this morning, yay!  I actually had homework this weekend, but this morning I actually really had nothing to do.  So I finished my Bio, did Drama, and I am done my English though it is not due.  All I have to do before Wednesday is know my lines for our bonus scene we are doing for Drama.  Tonight I am going to Mat's house for a get together thing for his b-day with a bunch of my friends and we are having dinner and probably watching movie's and stuff tonight.
