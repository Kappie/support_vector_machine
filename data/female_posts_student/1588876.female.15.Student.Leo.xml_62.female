"we eat Quakers for breakfast" (Quakers are our rival school's mascot) "those are some some kick-ass pants!" (junior balzer dancers came to dance for us to day. they had some sparkley-ass pants) "marry me, Grover!" (our 2nd mascot...explain later) "i want some money!!!" (tennis team was throwing money filled balls into the crowds) "someones going to break their neck!!!" (ppl were lunging for the $ balls in the bleachers)  i said so many things i cant even remeber all of them. but i do know i was the loudest one there. ask my [annoyed] friends.  "shut up!" -madeline, sarah, and a few unspirited strangers.  i've got some fucking school spirit. i love chs warriors ok?   yeah today was a good day. i heard a funny story about wesley yesterday, but i dont i i'll post it b/c im just a damn considerate person like that.  so yeah...today was fun. and this morning josh and i reconciled and we're good now. for awhile we hated eachother...long story. but now we're gravy.  pep assemblies are so damn cool.   announcement: ladies and gentlemen of the germy- i have decided that next year im going to be a cheerleader...if i make it. yes, ok. you can say all you want about the cheerleaders, but i can guarantee that i will never be a mean, bitchy, clique-obsessed, overly tanned barbie.  i will be cool. i am cool.  later
