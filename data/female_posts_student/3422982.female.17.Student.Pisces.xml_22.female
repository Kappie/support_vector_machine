Why was the whole family finally told yesterday when this happened a month ago?  Because she tried it again.  I knew it was going to happen, but I didn't want to believe it.  I'm in shock right now, I have been all day... I've tried doing things to keep my mind off it and I can't.  I feel so bad for them.  I don't know what to do, not that there's anything I can do.  It really sucks.  But, oh well.  I'll just have to sit around and worry.  I just hope this time they keep her in the hospital for a while. later dayz
