Gene showed up around 12:30 and I was still in my pajamas, cause I had been waiting for my clothes to dry :p so I had to hurry and get dressed and go downstairs to answer the door. I was soo happy to see him :) We talked and I showed him my messy room :p and then we went outside and sat in the grass and talked for awhile. We ended up making out in the front yard :p I love kissing him :) Well by the time we were done or whatever he had to go cause he was almost late to be picked up. He told me later that he had to run the whole way :p Overall yesturday was a GREAT day! :)
