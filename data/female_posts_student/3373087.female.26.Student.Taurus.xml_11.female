It motivates me to do things that I know are not Christlike by making MYSELF the center instead of God.  Pride causes me to ignore the Spirit's conviction and causes me to demand my rights. If a humble life pleases God, then a prideful like causes Him grief.    Pride not only makes God unhappy, but it makes me unhappy too.  Pride prevents me from mending broken relationships and constantly living in sin leads to perpetual feelings of guilt.  But God should be the reason for living a humble life, not my own unhappiness.   How do I live a humble life? I often confuse humility with feelings of low self-worth.  Both say, "I am nothing". What then is the difference?   1) Humility makes me realize that I am nothing  in comparison to the greatness of God , whereas low self-worth comes from dissatisfaction with how God has made me.  Humility honors God, where self-defamation dishonors Him.   2) Humility is God-centered, but low self-worth is self-centered. 3) Humility ultimately leads to worshipping God as we realize that God loves us inspite of our lowliness.  Low self-worth ultimately leads to self-pity.  Over the last few days, I have been reminded (because this is nothing new to me) that I have a tendency towards low self-worth.  I have a hard time accepting the limitations that God has given me (limitations that, no doubt, were placed to keep me humble in the first place) and place impossibly high standards on myself. What's the result?  A big, fat pity-party. "Oh woe is me!  You must feel sorry for Christine and all the hardship she has to endure!" It's so ironic that a sense of low self-worth is actually a symptom of PRIDE because it desires to bring attention to oneself.    So how do I become humble instead? The answers are simple, but not easy to do because pride is such a big problem with me.    1) When someone corrects me, accept it and learn from it instead of feeling wronged. This is a big one to remember when I'm in clinics and am constantly corrected by the DVMs. 2) When the Holy Spirit convicts me to seek forgiveness from someone I have wronged, DO IT.  B is so good about  quickly  saying "sorry" when he feels like he has wronged me somehow.  This attitude sets a good example for me, but I still am not as quick to seek forgiveness.  When I was upset and depressed this weekend, there were many things that I said out of frustration, but I was slow and reluctant to say "sorry".  I tried to justify my words and actions by using fatigue as my excuse.  I also often play the part of the victem, and act like it's somehow okay for me to hurt B because I have been hurt.   3) Seek the approval of God alone, not others.  I often crave flattery, which builds up my pride. In the hospital, I really want the clinicians and the other students to think that I'm smart and capable. I think God is trying to break me by denying me of this flattery.  Instead of flattery, I've heard lots of criticism and correction this week. I think this is intentional on God's part because He knows how much I want to hear praise from people. Even when I try to have the attitude of a servant, I do it so people will like me for doing nice things for them, not to show them God's love.  No, this week, I want to have the attitude of a servant and keep in mind that God is my master.  If I work to please God and work to honor him (thus, decreasing my pride), then I will not be hurt by the criticism of others.
