Wow, the end just gets you!  Oh boy, so sweet!  Not to mention the HOTT sex scenes!  WOW  I partied hardy at Nicole's Block party tonight--party hardy as in chillin with people I dont know...and the Beauchenes!  So, we ate, drank soda, and watched as massive thunderstorms rolled in!  They were the frightning ones: the billowing coulds, the blushed sky, and the increase in wind speed!  And there was a tornado warning in the county over! hmm...spelled disaster!  Well it certainly didnt stop us from seeing our movie did it?!  Well these seemingly disasterous thunderstorms fizzled, and they brought us some minor, static electricity showers...eh!  Entertaining for about 5 minutes!  But they also SOAKED us as we ran the 60 feet from the car to the theater!  I was drenched!    At the end of the Night...I was kind of glad that the Three of us went together!  I like the small group attractions!  And Joe's a Great guy, and Nicole's the best friend, so I like hanging with them--plus you can always cry with your best friend!  We already have plans to watch The Notebook together during Christmas Break.  That shall be fun!  Tomorrows plans go like this:  Get the Transcripts turned in before the Thursday Deadline, clean the house (eh fun!), and proceed to go bowling around 9ish!    Off to beddy bye---talk to ya'll tomorrow!
