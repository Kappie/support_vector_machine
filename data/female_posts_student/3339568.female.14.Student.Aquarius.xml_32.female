The school has some kinda unspoken rule that no-one is allowed to show their midriffs,  ever . Our tops actually didn't, but while I was doing mi round-off, shock!, horror!, surprise! Mi shirt went up 2 inches, now they want us to wear a black leotard under the top. Man they are picky. And after we finished the dance, Mrs. Wilson is like "Well, it's not really very polished!" " HELLO! ", I said to her, "We had  4 DAYS  to make it!!" But of course she told me in response, that "It's easy to make up a dance in 4 days!" Hmph, has she eva tried?! I don't  think  so! And Mrs. Gray, who has been in a pissy mood eva since did a  REALLY  bad dye job on her hair, said we did too many things on the floor. Like they could do better. They hated it, but we got in anyway.  On a happier note. English was actually fun. Our class loves to debate things, impromptue and in our desks of course, not in a formal setting. Seeing as the class is filled with "intellectuals" (because we're English 1) as Han would call them, these debates often last ages and are never resolved. We are studying Romeo and Juliet, and Ms. Everingham felt compelled 2 ask a very controversial question (that she should have known all too well would result in this) of "Who's fault was it that Romeo and Juliet died?" We started off saying, well it was no-ones fault, you could go back to the start of time or wateva, and then we got into the question of whether they were actually in love, and then whether we believe in love at first sight. Which resulted in Kiera and i having a very heated 1 on 1 debate. Me, being the romantic that I am, was on love's side, and Kiera, being the "cold-hearted witch" as we called her (dw, all in joking context) was on the opposite. We ended up giving each other evil eyes, while Kiera said things to me such as - "One day you're gonna meet some hobo on the street and get married 2 him in one of those Las Vegas wedding chapels" and my retort was that she was "Going to end up as an old loveless lady, and all she had were her cats!" It was a very funni argument actually, one that progressed after the class had finished arguing and that Ms. Everingham had a lot of trouble breaking up. Seriously, don't try and fight with Kiera, espescially not on such a huge topic!  Although, i must admit, it  was  fun :P And it helped me to confirm my feelings...   Blogging off
