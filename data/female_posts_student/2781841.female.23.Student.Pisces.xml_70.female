So far, these have included:  - Funny limericks - Ask Heather Ann about [name deleted to protect the innocent] - suggestive emoticons - Because clowns are scary - Complaints department - Pictures to build your self esteem - Amanda finds this odd  So, in retaliation, I have changed his link to "vogon poetry central" â€” a strong insult indeed!  And with a geek factor due to the Douglas Adams reference, so it's highly appropriate.  Stay tuned, this isn't over yet.
