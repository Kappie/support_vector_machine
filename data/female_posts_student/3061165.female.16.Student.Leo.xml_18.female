Failed chem by 4 marks, physics by 2 marks and maths by 1 mark(got add some marks... failed anyway >  Anyway, we had Cross-Country yesterdae! I met up wif Tabby, Sailam and Yipeng at 201's mac in the morning to hav breakfast. Saw Hafiz and his family(his bro resembles him very much) havin breakfas there too. It seemed like it was going to rain when we're eating(dark sky and very windy...) and it did when we reached there. Jus drizzling though... We started the run soon after we got there(ron was sprinting all the way) and soon we kinda got separated. After somewhat 2km or so, I saw ron waiting ahead and then came back... He said he was havin a headache(too bad~ =p) and he didnt get the top 20. After the running, i felt like vomiting my MiLo.. Hahax... Drank too much in the morning perhaps? Well, tabby's reeali fast compared to the other gers and she even won many of us! We soon got a badge(so much for the runnnin) and we went to take bus 28(or is it? cant remember...). Tabby alighted at her house's stop while the rest of us went to the interchange.  Yipeng and I went home and ron went to sailam's house. I went home and rested/hav lunch etc.... Then went out again to SL's house to meet up and then to TM. We went to the arcade den well... Whatever. Really tired and my body aches(espcially the bottom tip bone of my spine... I fell on Friday when playing basketball n all...). Whoo~ Friday's half-day(National Day celebration) and Sat-Tus all holiday! On Monday(9th August) it's national day and got Sinpore Idol somemore! Yay~ Good.
