Dave Matthews Band June 17, 2004 UMB Bank Pavilion Maryland Heights, MO   Set Too Much  Granny  What Would You Say  Rhyme  Reason  New Song #2  When The World Ends  I Did It  Warehouse  New Song #1  Grey Street  Crush  New Song #3  Drive In Drive Out  Lap Steel Intro --> Grace Is Gone  Help Myself  Rapunzel   Encore: Bass Intro --> New Song #4  Stay   --------------------- They also played Granny, which is also a problem because I wanted to hear that.  Grey Street and GIG--I cant even IMAGINE what they will play tonight.  WOW, looking at this set list makes me frown.  I should have been in  MO last night for this.  Now I know that every set list I read, shows other than tonight, will rear the green monster.  No reviews have been posted yet about last nights show, so I cant include them in this post.  Enough Dave Speak till tomorrow when I can give you first hand the euphoria I feel. =)  Class last night was OK.  Took a quiz, like always.  Considering I only read half the chapter, I did pretty good on the quiz.  Passed it at least.  Lecture was pretty boring, but looking in those dreamy eyes......WAKE UP GREY!  Got out at a decent time and went to the grocery to pick up beer, and other drinks, and food that shouldn't be consumed unless you are tailgating before a show where you aren't even 'allowed' to tailgate.  To this I say: Show me the handcuffs.  The fuzzy kind preferred.  So I get home and  trouble and get me behind me now  are still awake....heh.  Tried to talk Sokie into taking a shower, but she wanted a bath with the purple soap.  So here I am, giving kids a bath at 9:45, an hour and 45 minutes PAST their bedtime and so far everything is going well.  Time to let the water out.  OH NO. Shit hits the fan.  "It is WAY past your bedtime, and morning comes early around here"  Yeah, I know, mom's words of wisdom.  I CAN control this.  Sleep comes fast for tired girls and boys and by this time all I want to do is sleep.  Phone rings and I pick it up and hear someone singing the lyrics to 'Should Have Been A Cowboy' by Toby Keith.  Whenever I hear that song, I only think of one person, and the person I think of happened to be the person serenading me over the phone.  Superfly!  Done with pool leagues wants to go to The Bar.  Twist my arm, I haven't been down there for awhile now and I miss the action, ie. BOYS!  Talking to Sod on the tele while I drive around the bend in the river, I get closer to one of the parking lots, and this place is packed.  Domers  should  be home!  This cant all be townies, can it?  Yes, it can.  Finally get past Andy, the one AND only bouncer who carded me up until about two months ago.  Why cant guys remember anything?  Not like its my first time, and not like I don't hang out with about 10 of the regulars.  Oh well, he knew me last night and I felt goooooood.  $1 pints, hell of a lot better than $9 beers I'll be sipping tonight.  Crowded back patio, nice to rub....eh, nevermind.  Ran into this guy we went to high school with and do the "Hey, How are ya's"....but wait, he says. "You have a tongue ring?". No, I say, lying.  Suddenly an arm goes around my back and its all fun in games.  Stud in the tongue = no effort to pick up guys.  Not my type, but good times.  Ended up back inside, sitting around the pool table watching four guys, two teams of....two, TRY and shoot pool.  This game was taking FOREVER.  I am so used to watching people who can shoot pool in only a few innings.  These guys were so sloppy also.  One of these days I'm going to play and make some people smile.  1AM rolls around and the music isn't making me move anymore.  What is a girl to do?  Walk on over to the jukebox and let the machine suck money out of my hand.  I've been on this Ben Harper kick, because I cant listen to DMB at the moment, so I play  Gold To Me .  Not only do I love the song, but it reminds me of someone and then all is good.  Superfly doesn't know much Ben so I'm singing to her and this guy with a Cubs hat, and Puma shoes comes walking by and IS SINGING THE SONG.  He is singing a Ben Harper song!  Now, it might not mean so much to you, but around here the radio stations do not even play good music.  NO dave, NO ben, NO jack, NO nothing good in the eyes of real people liking REAL music.  This I know, he has the album!  Obviously the $1 pints got to him a little sooner than myself, and its all about the smiles!  When a guy smiles, it makes me melt.  What an awesome night.  Dancing in a bar that isn't a 'dance bar', you kind of stick out, but when its good tunes, nothing else matters.  Song ends and Cub hat boy and I end up in deep conversations about how cool I am that I get to see DMB tomorrow, and how cool I am because I know the Cubs just swept the Astros and how cool I am because....well, you get the picture.  "What time does Taco Bell close?"  Superfly wants to eat.  She has to eat after drinking.  I tend to sit there and stare at her while she eats.  Alcohol and eating don't mix with me.  But tonight, tacos sound okie dokie by me.  She hasn't been to her apt. in two weeks, taking care of her man who fell at work.  Long story-no time for that now.  Pick up grease in a shell and head over to her place.  Looking at my watch, 3:15am.  Sleep sounds so good.  I'm glad I only have a 7 minute drive back to my house.  Crawl into bed, laying with my head at the foot end and only a t shirt..............   PEACE.LOVE.DMB   | 10 Hours! |
