I made a 79 which was above the average but much below the 100 that Carlos got. If I didn't like him so much for writing the entire group finance paper I may have been upset. I guess I will have to study more for next time.   By the way: there is another week and two days until lent is over. Can you say Party Time? However I am on DD duty for the rest of the weekend because it looks like it could get a little rowdy in West Lafayette.   Michelle- I hope you feel better. Eat some soup and get some rest girl.
