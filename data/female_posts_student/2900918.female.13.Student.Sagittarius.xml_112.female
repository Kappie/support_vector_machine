Video #1: "Ass Tent" This video is for promomting "Take Off Your Pants And Jacket" [one of their albums]by  Blink . Features  Mark  being a doctor,  Tom  being a teacher explaining about the effects and what not and  Travis  as a patient[has lil' screen time so you might not catch him].  Video #2: "Old Mc Mark" Mark singing to children, smashing guitars, cussing... what more can you ask for? "I love kids, kids love music... so I love kids' music. I mean, it's basic math!"-Mark in the video.
