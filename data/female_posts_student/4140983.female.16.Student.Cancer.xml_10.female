And yet, when you've gotten inadequate sleep for the last two months, 6:30 is a very harsh mistress. I only have an hour and a half until I have to be at the school, luckily we're all of thirty seconds away so I can make a mad dash to get ready ten minutes before 8 and make it there with eight minutes to spare.  A good thing about being up this early is that I get to talk to Nadine. I love talking to her, when I make sense or don't. Something about her puts me on guard, and it's nice for a change. We don't really talk about much, she tells me about her life, I tell her about mine, we talk about various other things that I'm fairly sure don't interest her, and we're on our way. I don't feel extremely attached to her, but I like talking to her OK, and that's different.  This is probably the oddest thing to think about, but I can't decide what to wear. I have a farmer's tan, and while I probably won't wear anything other than t-shirts and long-sleeved shirts over the year, it's bothering me. I can either wear a t-shirt and roll up the sleeves, or wear a tank top, which gives me two options: slutty white cleavage tank top, or tie-dyed tank top I told myself I'd never wear again but which still resides in my closet, because I have big plans for homemade tie-dyed underwear. Yes, really.  On a completely nonrelated note, if I don't eat soon, I may pass out. That's the bad (good?) thing about the school year: I'm hungry in the mornings. When I wake up at nine or ten, my body's already gone into starvation and I won't eat until dinner because I'm not hungry. I just don't notice it. And now I feel like I'm about to DIE from hunger. I hate when I wake up starving and I can't eat fast enough...and then it kills my stomach. Anyway, I have to eat light because even though I'm coming home at noon, Nicole does hard workouts.
