It's partly because it's the first president I remember (I don't remember the Carter years very well, being 0-3 years old).  The first presidential election I remember was the 84 when Mondale and Ferraro (I really wanted a female vp when I was 7) were running against Reagan and Bush.  I remember sitting in the Montessori playground talking about politics with Kortney Groves, Melissa Camacho, and Laura Greene... Although Pat Farley may or may not have been involved, too.  I guess I started into politics pretty early... I was a fan of Dukakis when I was 11, too.  Even though the 11 year old in me thought the pee slogan was clever: George Bush don't Dukakis.  It works better out loud.  Anyhow, I'm also moved enormously by Nancy Reagan.  I never had much interest in her when I was younger, but I do remember it being the first time I'd heard of breast cancer.  And while in so many ways, I can't help but think that his death was merciful from this debilitating disease (if you've never met and/or loved anyone with Alzheimer's it's truly more devastating than could be imagined), her obvious love and grief make me want to reach out to her in some way...  Moving on.  I'm still working on Mary's scarf... and I'm SO tired of pink by now.  I'm enamored of the Marcy Playground CD.  It makes me wonder why I waited 7 years to buy it.  I remember the first time I heard "Sex and Candy," I was in Toledo, OH (heaven save us) visiting my friend Dani from college in Boston, we were driving to the Toledo airport to pick up her sister and her sister's boyfriend (now ex-husband), and the song made Dani turn up the radio really loud and speed really fast.  But it does the same thing to me.  I had anoter weird dream about one of my kids from Pasadena.  She was totally one of my favorites, and when I first met her, you couldn't understand a word she said, and she'd jibberjabber ALL the time.  When she first learned to say "Heather" it came out as "Headyouuuuuuu" (someone said it sounded like she was speaking whale) but by the time I left, she was using wonderful sentences very appropriately, and when she didn't have the words she would use a sentence she knew that would sort of fit the bill.  Anyhow, I had a dream that I had to say goodbye to her again, which was hard, but her mom wanted me to come with them to pick out a bathing suit for her (the girl) and then we'd eat lunch at the food court in the big Target that was right behind my office.  There was something else, but I can't quite put my finger on it at the moment.  I had a message on my voice mail this morning from an Officer Someone with the Colorado State Police.  It was about making an appointment up to a week in advance, and he'd try the other number.  It was likely a wrong number, but I was afraid I'd forgotten something REALLY important... like  a crime I'd commited, or a court date, or something...  I hope I didn't.  I want a job.  I want a new computer.  I want to be back in school.  All things in their time, I suppose.
