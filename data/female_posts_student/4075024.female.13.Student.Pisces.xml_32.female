It Rocked and now i have a way better appreciation for John Mayor~! And like two days ago i went to Splashtown and I had a blast1 It was like the last day i got to spend with my cuz before she went bac to Cali. As for yesterday i didn't do much, but i still had fun talking to my best friend Kirstin through e-mails, b-cuz i am not allowed to use A.I.M. for a couple stupid reasons. She is pretty cool, we hang out a lot, and we try not to keep secrets from each other, but you know how that is! However, we do have tons of fights, they hardly last a whole day. Well ne wayz today has been pretty slow, cuz i didn't even wake up til about noon. But once again I am talking to Kirstin! Not to sound crazy or ne thing i can't wait until school starts again, b-cuz i want to see how much everyone has changed! (No offense Kirstin) Well ne wayz i got 2 go! Hope i get to sumit another post soon! bye
