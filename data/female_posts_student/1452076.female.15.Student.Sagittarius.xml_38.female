I didn't quite enjoy it because I tasted more raisins than hazelnuts. It still can't be compared to the Oreo Cheese Cake I ate four Sundays ago. Secret Recipe has the best Oreo Cheese Cake around. Absolutely heavenly. It's cheese is white and smooth and does not leave a thick aftertaste like normal cheese cakes do. And unlike normal cheese cakes that make you stop halfway because it is so filling, Secret Recipe leaves you yearning for more. It's cheese practically melts in your mouth and slides down your throat. Although I paid an exorbitant 5 bucks for such a puny slice, I think it's worth the experience.
