Then for the rest of the day I've just been sitting around watching random things on tv. Oh, what a fun life I have.  I've found a band that's really good. They are called Rise Against. Their lyrics are very meaningful and not about the normal crap. In fact the title of this post is a lyric from their song called Black Masks  Gasoline.  So right now, I'm just talking to Josh and Molly and listening to Rise Against.  School tomorrow, ugh, kill me now.  Listening to: [To The Core by Rise Against]  If I could paint how I feel, I'd draw bullseye on your forehead my anger is not misdirected unless it somehow misses you  time spent on hate, is time gone to waste , I watch you point and click your life away  so cast the stones that I'll gladly catch and I'll throw them right back, I stand behind the things I say, you type the words you won't say to my face  time spent on hate, is time gone to waste , I watch you point and click your life away  it seems you've let me go again, just like the day you let me in, the best of intentions, you were never mine to begin with  so step away from the fucking screen, see a world outside your scene, maybe then you will know and realize the lack of threat you pose
