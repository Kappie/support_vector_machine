Thanks :)  anyways...i just love this set up, i mean this moment..i'm actually surfing the net while my family is having dinner (? sorry if im confusing you?)!! that means that i am skipping dinner and alone in my room, without someone looking at you, teasing you and questioning you (Btw, all those is my sister..lol)...sigh...i just love  free time ...don't you think it's fun being alone  sometimes? ...  i just love it! its so   peaceful and serene   (sorry if i sound funny lol)...having the time to think and reflect on your everyday activities and stresses.*sigh* wish there was more time...time flies so fast when you're having fun, ain't it?  *sigh*  Lari
