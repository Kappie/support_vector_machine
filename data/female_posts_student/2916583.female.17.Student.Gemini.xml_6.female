The big letters catch people's eyes, and the idea of free anything draws people in.  I just designed a flyer, and it's going to get lots of responses.  Place your message on flyers, screen savers, boards, on websites (like this one) and get people to advertise.  So far, no luck on human advertising.   Well, I'm at school now, and I'm freezing.  One thing's for sure: if it's cold outside, TD is sure to be colder, and hot if it's hot outside.  Why am I freezing?  Another tip: if you cut your hair uneven, and your mom says you have to do a million things to get her to even it, and she doesn't, don't walk to school in a mini skirt! (unless you're really, really mad.)  The fact that my sweat is beginning to freeze has something to do with it.   You know, guys have it sooo much easier.  At the editorial board meeting today (newspaper - yes, I'm a newspaper freak), we were discussing how guys have it easier; we never discuss newspaper.  It all started when Sarah began putting on eyeliner, and Aaron asked if it would hurt if the pencil was pointed.  Then began a discussion of prom (guys only pay $120 for tuxes, we pay upwards of $150), hairstyling (guys rub gel through their hair for two seconds, girls straighten or curl for at least 15 minutes), and makeup (guys none, girls take 20 minutes to get it right).  I think that for one day, guys should have to apply makeup, wear dresses and stilettos, style hair and go tanning.  That would be fun. For all the Keyettes out there reading, remember: Patricia for President, Lindsay for Vice-President, Lauren for Secretary!  I'll post election results tonight.  Later.  You are Eleanor of Aquitaine.  She was a strong- willed queen who knew well the duties of her life.  She spoke up where other women remained silent; it was only the 1100's.  Life is sometimes hard for you, with many people against you, but you can survive in this hardship.  You have your ideas in your head and it takes a long time to get them out. Sometimes you feel frustrated because others are not as good as you, but you love with a passion and fight for what you believe in. Please rate my quiz.  I cant say I dont wish to sound desperate, because I am.  So that doesnt help much.     urlLink What famous female ruler are you?
