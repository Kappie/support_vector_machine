So God help me keep me movin' somehow.   Don't let me start wishin' I was with him now.   I've made it this far without cryin' a single tear   And I'd sure hate to break down here.   - Julie Roberts         i love that song...it makes me jsut wanna sit down and think about all the shit thats going on in my life and makes me wonder, why am i still trying to be with you...why do i even care ne more? am i this pathetic to want something this much?.. i mean honestly i can live without you as well.. but id really like to live with you... whatever         lunch time.. ill write back later
