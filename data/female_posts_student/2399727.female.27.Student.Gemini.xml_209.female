Then last night I closed my eyes in the dark and saw light in that same area. That was one of the symptoms I experienced during my retinal detachment last summer. Naturally I freaked out and called my ophthalmologist. She was contacted at home because she is off today and she agreed to see me on Monday morning. I'm sure it's nothing. I hope it's nothing. It's going to be an anxious weekend though.  More to come...
