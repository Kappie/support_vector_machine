Anywho, I was in the kitchen and he jumped onto the fence like our cats do as they jump from the drive to the patio. I mean this huge great big fox was on the fence! Amazing creature. He is in really good condition with a fluffy tail and a really nice orangy red coat. And he has huge ears!!! And lovely blue eyes. It was a bit scary when he looked dead at me though.
