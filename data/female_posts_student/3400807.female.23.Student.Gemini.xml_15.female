They aren't unfriendly. They smile and laugh with each other, to each other, in their small groups. Children. Grandmothers. Business people. Students. Tourists, like me.   The trains here are so clean. People take their trash home with them. They teach their children not to spit candy on the floor. It's not hard to relax on these trains. Looking out the windows at the countryside and then city, passing once more into countryside. The wheels are smooth and fast on the tracks. The conductor announces a stop but it dosn't intrude and I think, is it because he speaks softly or because I don't know what he is saying. The air conditioning keeps us all comfortable, chilled, refrigerated, preserved. Even in the rain.
