Can't believe I went 5 days without crying. Of course, I blew it when I said that and ended up crying. Eh.  I cannot sleep. I have bites all over my body and I've spent countless hours picking away the scabs.  outcome: itty bitty red scars Scars that will stay for another good 2 years or so.  Dammit. Some say scars add character. I sure hope so. I am one of those people that see beauty in what most consider ugly...things people don't notice. Like that old man...  The winter of 1990 was when I first saw him. I was about three or four (can't handle numbers and calculations at this hour...actually, any hour because I'm a fart head that failed math twice in my high school years). The indent on the south side of the Bon Marché department store building was where he played his accordion. He played beautifully. He had this tin cup on the top of the accordion. The sound of change clashing down made such a wonderful noise. Added spark to what he was playing. I only saw him during the winter time. He'd be out in his wheelchair, his arms shaking, eyes always closed (Was he blind? I will never find out!), his head bobbing up and down. It always made me sad to see that no one would stop, just for a brief moment, and admire his playing. I always watched from afar. The bus stop was right across the street. I gave him money. Made mom do it too. Wish others would, but everyone was too busy christmas shopping. I always wondered why he wasn't with his family. I wondered if he had a home at all. I wondered why I even gave a fucking shit about this guy. I didn't know him. I wondered why I couldn't be like the other kids. Just be happy playing with my toys. I wanted to be ignorant. Stupid and happy, fer sure. I would often sit alone in the corner of dad's work room or behind the lilac bush in my yard and just think. I thought so hard and long until it gave me a headache. Wisdom trips...reality checks...that's what those were. I was extremely mature for my age. Kinda hard to imagine, eh? With me nowadays going about, shouting "YYYYYYYYAY!" every chance I get. Silly me. I was more mature about sex when I was four than I am now. Ain't that a bitch? It's so funny. How did such a thing happen?!  Well, conclusion time now... Around '94 was the last time I saw him. He was in his eighties. I took a wild guess and assumed he died. Sigh...I will always remember good ol' accordion man. I will take his memory to my grave.  ZzzzZzzzZzzzZ  And that, folks, is how you make a birdhouse.  Goodnight.
