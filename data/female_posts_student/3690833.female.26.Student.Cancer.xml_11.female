Due to creepy stalker weirdos that may or may not come across this blog, I am going to have to change names and some locations to protect the... well, if not innocent, unsuspecting. For those of you that have stumbled upon this blog, and don't know me-I can tell you now that my life is pretty uninteresting even to myself, so sorry in advance... I go to school full time, and I sling alcohol in a local bar/grill. I spend a bit too much time in said work location, primarily because the people I work with have become friends. I have lots of friends and family in the northeast and it is for them that I have created this site, if they bother to check it out that is. I have a fantastic boyfriend, and I am soon going to assign him a pseudonym so I can talk about him more. I intend to post some fun pictures, and I will try to write a few lines everyday, but no promises on that one
