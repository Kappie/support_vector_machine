I like to have my hair match my pink flipflops.  i am so impressed with lizzie's assessment, i'm running to buy her new book: decorating with Lizzie McGuire.   maybe i will. i have to decorate a new place in austin, and i kind of like the girly crafty ideas - much more fun than the staid martha stewart type stuff. and it's nice being told 'being a girl rocks' on every 2nd page. maybe i'll get chris a copy too for his new place!
