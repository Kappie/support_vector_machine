God must want me on earth a little longer, to fulfill His plan and my purpose in life.    I had an accident today, in the exact same place as 2 or 3 years ago--making a left turn off of Barton Springs road onto Lamar.  It was under the same conditions.  It had been raining, and the roads were slick.  Just before that accident a few years ago, I had a premonition that I was going to be in an accident, which made what happened today all the more bizaare.  Anyway, in the previous accident my back tires had caused me to hydroplane and fish-tail out of control, and the car in the right-hand lane hit me on the side.  Today, the exact same thing happened--in the exact same place on the exact same street.  Only this time, there was hardly any traffic (thank God).  I must have over-corrected or something, because not only did I fish-tail, but I accidentally swerved from the far right lane all the way over across the road, over the median, and into oncoming traffic.  Luckily there was hardly any traffic going south on Lamar on the other side of the median, and the guy heading towards me was going slow enough to stop.  They were kind enough to just sit there and wait until I had gained my composure, drove across the street and into a parking lot, and got out of the car and made certain I was OK.  I didn't really realize the magnitude of the situation, or how I wouldn't be sitting here right now if there had been more traffic on the road, or if that median hadn't been there to at least slow me down.  God must really want me to stick around, b/c this isn't the only time I've escaped near-death situations.  The mere act of being born, for one thing--I was 3 months premature and was fed through tubes for 6 weeks before I gained enough weight to even come home from the hospital.  Then there was that time I was getting off work, and some jack-ass ran the red light and almost hit me on the driver's side going 50 miles an hour.  Luckily I hesitated just a few seconds before going at the green light.  Then there was that time in Cuba, when I almost got hit by a live wire that had exploded off of a telephone pole following a hurricane...not to mention the near-misses by crazy, insane Latin American drivers who just will not stop if you're crossing the street...  Note to self: get new tires, and under no circumstances drive at that intersection of Lamar and Barton Springs after it's been raining.  I'm thankful to be alive and sitting here typing this.
