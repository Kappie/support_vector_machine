Not only would I not be seen dead in swim wear, but I also don't concider thisto be a"family", we're morethe ruins of a family, than a family. Even when we were a family, I always felt like an outsider, she didn't even think to invite me until I questioned where they were going...so... Bah, back to my original point... which I haven't actually established yet... The convo went:          Mother:  Well good morning stranger.
