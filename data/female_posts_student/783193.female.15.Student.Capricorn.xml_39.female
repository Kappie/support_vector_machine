The whole thing was a lot of fun, with Jane blurting out ever five minutes, "Wow, I can't wait to see how beautiful I look in these pictures! I'm going to look so GOOD, Jessica!" and Jessica going, "Oh my gosh, these pictures are going to turn out so bad. I just know they are." and Ro saying, "I wasn't ready for that picture! Do you think my cheeks are too big?" I decided to make it all better by running around and telling Jessica that "I felt so nekkid". Then we went to Newpark and walked around a little while, found out that there were two Claire's there, and I bought a thumb ring. Then we went to American Eagle and a couple of other places. We went back to Excel, picked our pictures, which actually looked pretty good (except for the ones where Ro made me laugh.. heh.), and listened to Jane squeal about how great she looked. Then the rest of it breezed by, and we went to Kumon. Came home afterwards and ate fish and snap peas, but I couldn't taste any of it, due to my new sickness, which Ro classifies as Sars. I, however, think it's just a cold, or hay fever. I made the volleyball team, by the way. Ends up that I'm not the only one that's scared of Eric. I guess "intimidated" is more the word, but that sounds like we're going to battle with him or something. Anyway, I'm looking forward to practices. And games. We filled in all our classes for next year, and I'm checking into clubs and stuff. Whooooeeeeeee.. I have to go work on my I-Search project.
