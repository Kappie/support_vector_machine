I look at my caller ID I see every number Except the one I want to see I want to scream, break down and cry Get away, 10,000 miles Lately, I have been a shred of myself Not completely me I cant seem to hide The feelings of weak, deep in me The memories, they haunt me still Lying down, on a hill Staring, up in the sky I want to scream out and cry Take the knife And watch me die Through my flesh Through my bones Through my organs And hear my moans Im falling apart, with memories of you I can not forget Filled with regret So much sorrow So much pain Blood spilt Drips like rain I dont cry rivers I now cry floods I drown in my sorrow And scream for help As I gurgle the water And my tears seem to melt I looked at the caller ID Twas your number I didn't see Blankess filled the screen In that moment, I cried out and screamed I took the knife, and finish my dream.
