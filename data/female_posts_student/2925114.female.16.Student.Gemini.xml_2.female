I loved it so much more becuase he was there. It was so much better! He held my hand the whole time, I admit it, i was scared. It was way more comforting. My mom was there too and it didnt hurt as much as my nose... but it still hurt. Nothing I cant handle. Yup so I have to keep reminding myself i have it done because it is way too cool for me to even start to understand. It rocks, i cant get over it. Yup so I thought I'd write my thoughts about it because I've got so muh energy now after having it done!  YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
