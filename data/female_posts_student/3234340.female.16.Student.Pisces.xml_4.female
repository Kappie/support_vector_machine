My friends never invite me anywhere bc they automatically assume im out with mat. If they were to invite me somewhere i'd most likely go, and maybe i'd even bring mat along... but i guess they just figure we already have plans.. which is usually far from the truth. We're so indecisive we usually dont know what we're gunna do until last minute and we usually end up goin to eat and to a movie or i end up goin over to his house.. how fun and interesting huh? I dunno i guess i just see all my friends goin out and havin fun and they assume i cant bc im most likely doin somethin with mat. I wish they would just ask every once in a while. i mean they know how ppl can get when theyre datin someone. *sigh*
