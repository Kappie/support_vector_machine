Rehearsal for commencement was ok. We don't sound too bad. Dan didn't show up. Darn. I was so sad. Well, not really. In band we just signed yearbooks still. I didn't have many people sign mine. Kind of funny how I don't know many people in my band. I didn't know a lot of the seniors when we went down the line and shook their hands yesterday. Basically just Allie and Katie, and Danny, and Max. Music theory was of course, boring!!! I loathe that class so much. So so very much. I only like it because I sit with my friends. Chemistry was ok. We got our tye-dye shirts back. Mine wasn't great, but it was ok. Diane's was extremely good. I'm glad. I think it made her feell good since everyone was like, "Whoa, Diane, yours is SO perfect! It was cool. We talked about stuff with Kathryn and whatnot. Diane understands my fear. I'm scared and I haven't gone through it. Not many people seem to understand why I'm so so worried for Kathryn. I don't want him to hurt another one of my friends. Not again. I can't take it.  Then we went to the assembly and I was going to sit with Diane, but then Carrie came, and...when we went in the bleachers I wasn't even sitting next to Diane. Not that there's anything wrong with Carrie. She's really really nice from the few times I've talked to her, but then I saw Kathryn and I wanted to talk with her so I sat with Kathryn and Kelly. It was a really long assembly, and really warm in the bleachers and ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh, it wouldn't have been bad if I hadn't been sitting between some lady who laughed like a wicked witch and Matt. Matt just doesn't know when to stop or even when not to start as someone else said today. He'a really a nice kid...but, argh. Oh well. The assembly was actually kind of sad. Zach won a lot of awards. It's too bad that he wasn't there to accept them. :( That's just so terribly sad. I can't imagine what it's like for his parents. Their only child. His parents were there though. Then, the goodbye to Mr. Paulsen was nice. They played the song, "Time of your life," and I really love it, but unfortunately it always makes me sad. What I find ironic however is that it's really a sarcastic song, but...they always use it in goodbye videos for High School and whatnot. I guess it could be easily taken seriously. Paulsen was a good principal too. He always came to our band stuff and whatnot when he could. He's a good guy.   So, after the assembly finally ended, and after I didn't even get to talk to Kathryn, I went to health. We just talked about more STD's. It was, umm...exciting? I'm really glad I decided a while ago to remain abstinent until marriage, because I'd probably be freaking out after all this. So many grody STD's. Hmmm. Speech was good. Bob gave a speech on butter. Haha, Bob's a great kid. I love my speech cloass. Everyone is so nice to each other and it just...rules.   Hm, lunch was good. We sat outside. I kind of miss the floor sadly. I know it's weird having to get up every day when they sweep, but I don't care. that's where I feel comfortable. Lunch was still good. We all just talked and whatnot. My two groups are sort of merging, so that's cool. I can spend time with all of them at once. YaY! I haven't seen Nikki in a long time unfortunately though. I think we're growing apart. Oh well. I'm really excited to see Finding Nemo with Emily and Mary Clare and Kathryn and Kelly on Friday. It will definitely be a fun time.   Math was boring as usual. We just went over our review packets and whatnot. I actually know a lot in it. I'm shocked. I loahte math so much. What an annoying subject. And finally, government was cool. I got a chance to talk with Kathryn. We were sort of supposed to be doing our study guides but...yeah....that didn't really happen. She's having serious doubts, thank goodness. I mean...I'm trying to not get her really angry with me, but at the same time...definitely let her know my opinion. Nobody wants her to go out with him. Her parents don't even like him. That's got to say something. I really don't trust him, and I love Kathryn and don't want her hurt. Oh well, what's supposed to happen will happen. God will watch over Kathryn.   And then tonight I just went back to school to get my tye-dye shirt which I forgot. Grrr. Hmmm, then I went to meijer and got a shirt that was on clearence, and that was my funfilled evening. Now I shall go off to do homework. HOMEWORK!!! I still have homework. This is NOT right.   Another turning point a fork stuck in the road Time grabs you by the wrist directs you where to go So make the best of this test and don't ask why It's not a question but a lesson learned in time  It's something unpredictable But in the end is right I hope you had the time of your life  So take the photographs and still frames in your mind Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial For what it's worth it was worth all the while  It's something unpredictable But in the end is right I hope you had the time of your life  It's something unpredictable But in the end is right I hope you had the time of your life  It's something unpredictable But in the end is right I hope you had the time of your life  .................................
