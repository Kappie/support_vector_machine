The boy I was in love with when I was in 4th grade.  Haha.  Not so much a boy anymore.  She's done this before, with a guy I was obsessed with in 9th grade.  We're getting old.  So many weddings.    I sometimes think that if my life wasn't crazy busy like it is now that I would just fall apart.  I wouldn't know how to deal.  But now I'm not sure I can deal with the crazy busy-ness, since I am also crazy confused about just about every aspect of my life.  I have to just hope/assume that it will all work out for the best, right?  At least the way it was meant to (of course, if I believe there is some certain way that things are "meant" to work out, does that mean I believe in predesination? I wonder about that sometimes)...  Is there really a reason for it all?  Sometimes I just don't know.
