The movie tells a story of an ogre who suddenly looses his beloved swamp to a bunchful of fairy tale characters. To get his home back without any interference, he confronts  Lord Farquaad  (voice  urlLink John Lithgow ), the short, cruel, self-absorb prince who really wants to be a king. Lord Farquad then cuts him a deal, if Shrek could bring him  Princess Fiona  (voice  urlLink Cameron Diaz ), who is captured in a tower with a dragon guarding it, then he gets him swamp back. Shrek then goes the rescue with a donkey,  Donkey  (voice  urlLink Eddie Murphy ), who he saved previously from the clutches of Farquaad's army. So...to cut the whole thing short, along the way, Shrek finds friendship and love. I really love this movie, which is based on a book with the same title. This is not the common fairy tale read to you for bedtime stories. This is twisted (in a good way) and pretty much in touch with reality. My favorite bit is when Princess Fiona says she supposed to be beautiful - she's an ogre now (a curse is involve in it), Shrek replies "But you are beautiful". Awwwww, it just melts my heart. Now if I could just find a man who would say that to me.    Link    urlLink Official site - http://www.shrek.com  Does it need description? It's the official site.
