The Holocaust Remembrance Project Essay Contest asks for essays under 1200 words that address the holocaust and specifically why it is important to remember and what students can do.  It seemed worth trying to do.    Of course my essay is currently too emotional and begins with  "Six Million.  The number is impenetrable, I will never have six million of anything worthwhile in my possession, and nothing is as worthwhile as a human life.  Whenever the Holocaust is brought up that meaningless number is thrown out to try to evoke emotion and response, and instead shuts people down.  Looking at countless faces, countless stories just causes them to blend and fade into one tragedy, making them easy to shove aside and forget.    Forgetting the holocaust is something I will never have to deal with, because for me there are not countless faces, there is one.  That is the face of my grandfather, my zayde.  He is 76 and he is dying.  With him will die his story and his family, because out of his entire family he is the sole survivor"  and: "Only recently have I become to even slightly begun to perceive what life must have been like for him all those years ago.  Ironically the cancer that is killing him is slowly starving him, taking away all of his nourishment as it grows.  Every day he becomes more and more confined, trapped within the few rooms of the apartment he shares with my grandmother.  Eventually he will probably lose it all, all control, all support, all mental capability.  He is once again under the reign of terror of an awful dictator."  Now that I've written it though, i don't want to change it, don't want anyone to criticize it, don't want it to be read by my family.  I am more willing to let complete strangers know what I feel than my immediate family.  I get angry when my sister reads my blog, yet when I find out that some random person has looked at it, it doesn't bother me.
