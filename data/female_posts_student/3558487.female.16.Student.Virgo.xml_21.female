Too bad i could only sleep in until about 9 this morning... i was hoping i could do better than that. The funny thing is that even when i don't have band, i have to do other band related things like my flute lesson which is today... so i never really get away from it.   Last night i saw napoleon dynamite... and it was hilarious, i think i might have laughed the whole time at everything. I do think a lot of things are funny, too, but it really was good. At first i was kinda confused, but eventually you get it. So many lines from that movie are greatness... it will definately be something they will talk about on "I love the millennium" or something like that on VH1 in many years. I wonder what they would call that show... there's "i love the 90's" what would it be... "i love the 00's", "i love the 2000's"??? thats weird... i guess they'll have to think about that...  shelly and i have gotten a little further on our overalls... hopefully they'll be finished by the first football game AND hopefully they'll be cute as well!! i'm sure we'll do a good job!   i also went to the annual band leadership party yesterday which was fun! the funny thing is that we are such band kids because our games are like... "DRUM MAJOR DUEL ON THE DIVING BOARD!!" and "SECTION LEADER DUEL"!! funny stuff.   ok, well its time to begin my sunday! its funny how its almost been a week since the last post and not much has happened in my life besides band... how sad.   Bye guys!!  - Lisa  SONG (i forgot this last post!!): "Do You Realise" - The Flaming Lips  "Girls only want boyfriends who have great skills. You know, like nunchuck skills, bowhunting skills, computer hacking skills... "     haha... oh so true napoleon, i mean, those bowhunting skills really get me!
