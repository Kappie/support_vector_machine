That's another school in our district, and now, they have to come to school with us until they re-build it. Worse for them: they go from 1.30-6.30...I'm still rather grouchy about this.  Skipped 3 block, to tired to go to math and learn. If I close my eyes for more than one minute, I sleep. It's getting kinda bad. Me and Misha went down to the thrift store, got some ties for Spring Con (Yeah Laurel!:P I have my tie! Onward to find chalice!) some books, and toys...of course:) Can't wait til I get my Winnipeg photos back, I forgot to tell mom to take them in today, so I'm hoping she might do one-hour-photo on them *hoping hoping hopiiing!*  It's funny, my watch is still on Winnipeg time, and everyone is asking me what time it is: Oh, it's 2.54 (them:) No it's not! Me: oh, then you DO know the time,.....:P It's been quite evil and most entertaining.... I want to go hunt people. I'll venture on tonniiiight...
