We just realised she was in the next room, behind the "double-sided-mirrors-that-are-not-up-to-pymble's-standards-becuase-they-are-cheap-and-you-can-see-through-them!" and she has 4gotten that we are her class!! We are all just sitting in this room fiddling with computers, half of us blogging and the other half watching random videos of stuff, and all at the same time having a chat. Come on, we are multi-tasking females and she is a dumb idiot who cannot put two and two together and realise she has a class!!!! Haha, but im not complaining! A whole, bludgy class on the computers without damn RENATA!
