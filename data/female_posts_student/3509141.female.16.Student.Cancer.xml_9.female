Detroying every aspect of me Acting like you know who I really am Telling me who i should and shouldn't be  You are hypocritical, undeniable Sadistic mess up I want to let this go Leave me alone and shut up  You really screwed me over What did I ever do to you? you have messed you my lines I want to get over this, don't you?  You're a real work of art Too good to be true Ironically, you are I always thought there was nothing you couldn't do  Too bad you couldn't loveme Too bad you couldn't feel the same way Too bad you lead me on Then pushed me away  Now i'm all alone Sitting here with my broken heart You stole it from me And ripped it apart  When I finally move on You come crawling back Telling me he's not worth it While he has everything you lack                         -- Gagan Bath
