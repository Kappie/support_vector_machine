Watched a video which wasn't as good as i hoped it would be ( Missing) anyone else seen it?  Been out this morning with Mark to do a food hygiene inspection, it was actually a very good/clean kitchen.  I have to do filing/compilation stuff this afternoon to do with private water supplies for head office, it will keep me busy but bored no doubt.
