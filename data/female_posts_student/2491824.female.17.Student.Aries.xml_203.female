I would feel loved but few are from friends or any one that really matters... :/  WOOOOAH! Just read this email from the Big O (Jeff O.) about OMC:  . . .The enrollment for OMC is currently 397 which includes the staff, but the overall camp attendance is 360+. . . .We still need about 44 more campers to fill the Mill completely. . . .  Wheeeee! That's INSANE!  400 people ....   400 PEOPLE   HOW-HOW TO THAT!  Tri-County camp was grrrrrrreat! Abso-fucking-lutely GRRRRRRRREAT! I can honestly say that I love 4-H more that anything else... Wow, so fun... So, so fun... I don't think that have laughed so much in my life... :D  My voice is a bit, um, rough after this week.. This is the first time since Intermediate camp (I went to Older this year) that I have even come close to losing my voice, and that was about 5 years ago...   ...Matt, of course, was at camp.  I made that sound like a bad thing. It wasn't. Not even close.  We talked some, but nearly everything we said to each other was goofy/stupid/funny or some combination (which was hardly different from when we were together).  Anyway, this just made me realize how much I miss him... I don't want to date him again, just be good friends because, as Morgan, Joanna, and I were talking about, he's the only person I know whose goofiness not only compares to but may possibly exceed my own. And that is fooking awesome in my book... I guess what I'm saying is that I just miss having conversations that lasted hours about the goofiest, stupidest stuff... When I told that to Jo she recalled a time that I was spending the night at her house and I was talking to Matt on the phone and she overheard us talking about Tetris for very long time... hehe.. I don't remember that, but I'm sure it was a very stupid conversation. :D  Oh! Oh! And I'm not white anymore. I have a tan! Wheeee! I don't look sickly when standing around most other people. Yaaaay! And!, I found someone with legs whiter than my own!... :) (Go Sarah!) :p
