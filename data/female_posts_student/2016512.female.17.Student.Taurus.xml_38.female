I don't really feel like composing anything in paragraph format right now, I'd rather just scatter my thoughts into little sentances.  Joni Mitchell is what Mr. D always told us about creative writing.  She doesn't tell, she shows.    I wish I could write like Joni.  I wish I could sing like Joni.  I don't wish I was Joni, though.    Is Kurt Vonnegut still alive?    You can't make yourself love someone.  You can't stop yourself from loving someone.  Well, you can sure interfere with it, but brainwaves can disrupt heart strings.  This is what happens when you listen to too much Joni.  Paper currency, Manda
