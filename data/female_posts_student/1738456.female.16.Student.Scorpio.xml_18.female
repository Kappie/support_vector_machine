The Prince spun me out, and my dress transformed into a pair of comfortable jeans and a burgundy tank top with lace at the top. My hair had fallen out of its up-do straight as a pin. I laughed at him curiously. He was now wearing a green-collared shirt and a pair of khakis. Neither of our masks had disappeared, nor had shoes appeared on my feet.  “How did you do that?” I asked, still laughing as the throng around us mashed together dancing wildly. Nobody was wearing formals anymore. The Prince pulled me in tight, so our hips locked. He smiled so that a row of perfectly straight pearly whites showed.  His hands flew off me and in the air. He clapped with the music, and we spun around so our backs touched. He turned and held me from behind. Our hands interlocked above my head. I turned so we faced again. Holding onto my hands, we shimmied closer together. The mob opened so that a circle formed around us. We danced around each other laughing and holding onto each other. Bowie trailed away with the music and the crowd clapped.  “You’re a great dancer,” he pulled me off the dance floor, and we wandered over to a table filled with food. More classic music played in the background.  “Thanks so are you,” I remembered briefly the girl from the wood, but shook her out of my head quickly. Hadn’t her hair been straight too? I poured myself a glass of punch, and we sat down next to the buffet table.  The King stood up in front and tried helplessly to get the crowd’s attention. Nobody but the Prince and I were watching him. Suddenly the Queen let out a sharp whistle blast and the whole room went silent.  “Th-thank you, dear,” the King said gratefully. He had an awful stutter. “Well n- now it’s time to t-take off your m-masks. And such lovely m-masks they ar-are. Ar-aren’t they, dear?”  “Yes, just wonderful,” said the Queen disdainfully.  “O-okay, well now. I’m going to count to three, then everyone will t-take their m-masks off. O-one, tw-two, three!” He said with as quickly as possible, and the entire court de-masked themselves. The King and Queen were the greatest shock to me. The king had a mouse’s snout, and the queen had a beak of a nose. Without her mask, she was much uglier than she had appeared. The King looked rather inhuman. Then I looked around the room. Everyone had dropped their masks to the floor. Once jaw-droppingly-beautiful girls were now plain, and even hideous. I breathed in sharply and turned to look at the Prince. He had managed to retain his handsomeness.  His eyes were as green as ever, and his lips just as full. I smiled at him, and looked around the room again wondering at how two repulsive parents could create such a beautiful man. The Prince found my hand and then turned my face to look at him.  “I’ve never seen anyone as beautiful as you before,” He said staring into my eyes.  “You would if you had a mirror Prince, you are quite dazzling yourself,” I smiled shyly, and looked at the ground. It reflected my face back at me, and next to it,  I saw the girl from the forest. She was scowling,  “That’s not fair!”  She mouthed. I looked from one face to the other confused. Then I shook my head and looked back up at the Prince, then something clicked in my head: I was becoming a part of this place, when all I had ever wanted to do was leave.
