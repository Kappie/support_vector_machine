It was really nice :) His semester is over as of Tuesday, and hopefully I will be able to see him a litte more often.  It has been decided that I have three weeks left with United Rentals. Please don't cry, no way in hell I am going to. The funny, even ironic coincidence is that I was hired and had my first day at United June 10th 2003 and my last day will be June 10th 2004. Funny, or maybe its just funny to me.  Brenden found a funny web comic...my feelings on   TROY   to the T.  urlLink  Check it out!
