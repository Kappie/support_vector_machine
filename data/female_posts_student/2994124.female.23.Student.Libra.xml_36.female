Does everyone eat this in Canada - or just Melanie?!! A girl I met in Canada (who happened to also be from Birmingham) is on instant messenger and has just told me she is eating a cinnamon bagel with nutella on-that's SO not fair. Do you reckon it would keep if you sent it in the post??  Have now just been making some wrapping paper (using my new stamps!) for a present I have for a friend who is having her baby on Tuesday.  Very therapeutic.  Well it has been cloudy and pretty dull here today (how British), but am looking out for the glimpses of sunshine in everything else.  Have set my alarm for 10pm on Wednesday, he he I get my next dose before you guys! Must go now and check out the Survivor page it wasn't working this morning. Such dedication.
