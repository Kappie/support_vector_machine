I tried to give you everything  But you just gave me lies   [Bridge]   [Bridge 2:]  Every now and then  When I'm all alone  I be wishing you would call me on the telephone  Say you want me back  But you never do  I feel like such a fool  There's nothing I can do..  I'm such a fool  For you   [Chorus:]  I can't take it  What am I waiting for?  My heart's still breaking  I miss you even more  And I can't fake it  The way I could before  I hate you but I love you  I can't stop thinking of you [last time x2]  It's true  I'm stuck on you   Now love's a broken record that's  Been skipping in my head  I keep singing yesterday  Why we got to play these games we play?   [Bridge]   Every now and then  When I'm all alone  I be wishing you would call me on the telephone  Say you want me back  But you never do  I feel like such a fool   [Chorus]   [Bridge 2]   [Chorus]   "Stuck" By Stacey Orrico
