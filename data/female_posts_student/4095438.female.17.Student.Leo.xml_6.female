It's basically meringue, whipped cream and fruit and is SO very delicious! :D        I took it along for the dessert bake-off at the  urlLink Food Lifeline  Staff Picnic at  urlLink Carkeek Park  in north Seattle. I'd never heard of the park before but it's a huge park complete with beach, a hgue grass area and play equipment for the kids. We rented out picnic tables, a shelter and a BBQ and had a great lunch. I actually had a really fun day - we had a water balloon fight, played some volleyball, a 3-legged race and all in all, I had great fun, especially with Denise and Nikki. OH and my pav won 1st place in the bake-off! LOL! Remember how I said it neevr ceases to impress? :P The Americans had never heard of it before let alone tasted it so they all loved it and I wound up with a $20 gift certificate for  urlLink Albertson's .  My 2003  urlLink school  yearbook arrived by international courier today (thanks Dad!). I was disappointed with the boring cover and the fact that most of the pages were black  white (stingy!) but the  urlLink Year 12 Formal  page looked awesome! It was kinda bizarre to see my valete in the back there and I quickly grew tired of seeing Skye's face on every second page but overall, it was good :)
