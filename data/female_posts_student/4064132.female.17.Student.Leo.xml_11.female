Well we were just talking and he gets totally pissed cuz of a personal oppion.  Over something that actually isn't that important. I was willing to let it fly but he talked mad shit and I wanted to know what was up with that. Now he has decided that we no longer need to speak and yada yada. Totally crappy. I miss him a bunch. Then had a plan to chill with a group of my friends this weekend for my birthday on the 3rd. Man was that the wrong idea.  Some never showed, some showed and were total dicks. My good friend whom is like a bro to me canceled and didn't tell his wife then came later with his wife and fought while here. It was a mess. Note...don't see The Village...Totally confusing.  Then my guy from a diff city came to chill. And he crashed. It was great to spend time with him and just be normal. Even though I was crabby. But then my best friend had to go and flirt with him. Knowing I'm into him and what not. I dunno pretty sucky.
