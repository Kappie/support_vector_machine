     
      Bottled up inside are the words I never said, the feelings that I hide, the lines you never read. You can see it in my eyes, read it on my face; trapped inside are lies of the past I can't replace. With memories that linger - won't seem to go away. Why can't I be happier? Today is a brand new day. Yesterays are over, even though the hurting's not.  Nothing lasts forever, so I must cherish what I've got.  Don't take my love for granted, for soon it will be gone - all you ever wanted of the love you thought you'd won.  The hurt I'm feeling now won't dissappear overnight, but someday, somehow, everything will be all right.  No more wishing for the past.  It wasn't meant to be.  It didn't seem to last, so now we are free.
