I've also had the song "Bullfrogs and Butterflies...they've both been born again..." running through my head all day, so how can I not be in a good mood?  That song rules!  I know the day will only get better, because I get to go to my Bluegrass guitar class tonight, which is amazing and fun all at the same time, and I also get to work my first overnight at my new job.  May not sound like fun for you normal folk, but I'm excited about it - I think I was born nocturnal.  It should be a good time.    I was asked to write a testimony for the quarterly missions report at Christ's Place about my missions experience.  Of course, being me, I procrastinated until the last possible moment, and just wrote it this afternoon.  We were only supposed to write a paragraph or two, but mine got a little lengthy.  I'm not sure how much of it will actually appear in the report, but I thought it would be fun to post the whole thing here.  It's not your typical missions testimony, I don't think...but then again, I haven't read a lot of them, so who knows.  Anyway, here is the aforementioned testimony...about the nasty sin of pride...   Sometimes God has to take you to the other side of the world in order to work a new thing in your heart.  Sounds farfetched, doesn’t it?  Well, it’s not.  Think of Abraham, Moses, and the Israelites.  God took them on journeys across the desert, up into mountains, and through enemy territory in order to show them new things, and to move them into new physical and spiritual arenas.  Well, God took me to Siberia to pray and to minister to the body of believers there.  He also took me to deal with some of my personal sin as well.  When I was first asked to write a testimony for this quarterly report, I started praying about what He wanted me to share.  He told me, “tell them how I freed you from your pride.”  I said, “Wow, LORD, that’s really something I want everyone to read about, my pride.”  His response to me, which has become quite frequent as of late was “just obey me, girl.”  So here I am, trying to obey, because I desperately don’t want to miss the next new thing He has for my life, and because those whom the LORD sets free are free indeed, and there is no place for shame.  I grew up spiritually in a collegiate ministry that focused on leadership and discipleship.  As I became more involved, they gave me more responsibility.  At first it was co-leading a Bible study with another girl.  Then it was leading a Bible study alone (something they normally only let staff do).  Then it was helping to lead a worship team.  Then it was speaking at the semi-annual women’s conference.  None of these things are inherently bad, but somewhere along the way, I gave the devil a stronghold, and pride began to creep into my life.  Well, when pride began to creep in, I obviously began to minister and teach from my own flesh, not from the leading of the Spirit.  After a few years of this, you just don’t have the energy anymore.  So I gave it all up.  Fast-forward a few years.  I get a missions postcard in the mail about a missions trip to Siberia.  Never had any desire to go to Siberia, don’t know anything about the place.  God tells me, “that’s what you’re doing this summer.”  I debate with Him and overanalyze the situation, as I always do.  Finally, I obey.  As we arrive in Siberia and begin to minister, the prayer that the Holy Spirit lays on my heart is, “Empty me out, LORD, and fill me up with You.”  Something broke in me when I prayed that.  A simple prayer, but that was exactly what He wanted.  He wanted humility, an acknowledgement that it wasn’t me setting people free or speaking truth over them.  It was the Holy Spirit through me.  We had some powerful times of ministry, and satan had ample opportunity to tempt me with thoughts of pride.  But the LORD was faithful to me each time, and gave me ways to fend Him off.  The one I remember most vividly was this: “When a man builds a beautiful house, you don’t congratulate the hammer on a job well done, you congratulate the man who built it.”  If you ask Him, He will provide the way out of temptation.  He set me free from pride because of my obedience and His mercy, and He also gave me the tools to stay free.   	All of this is just a very small picture of what you might experience should the LORD call you to missions.  Yes, you will experience a new culture.  Yes, the LORD will use you powerfully to minister to those who are tired and hurting and need to be set free.  But He will also use the time to minister to you, because you are His beloved.  Don’t forget that the kingdom of heaven is  within  you, and that is where His heart lies, with you.
