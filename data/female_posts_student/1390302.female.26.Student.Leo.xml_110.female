Have you ever asked a question you weren't sure you wanted an answer to and when you got an answer it made you feel like total shit?  You ask, feel bad, then feel like a complete @$$ for asking.  This happened to me today.  Sadly, it happens now and then, though it hasn't in a very long time.  So let's just say that Matt and I were in Cameron park -at Circle Point- it was raining, and we were sitting under some trees at a stone picnic table.  I asked him why he had never taken me to Circle Point before, he just completely ignored the question, so I persisted, he blew me off, I persisted, he blew me off, and it came to a point where I guess he was tired of my asking.  He informed me that he had ...Never mind, I can't say it.  Anyway, I got upset, but I think it was my fault.  What he did or did not do before me is not really changeable, there's nothing that can be done about it, so I suppose ignoring it is the best solution.   Yup, ignoring his sorted past, that's what I'll do.  I just have trouble understanding it sometimes.  Yet alas, it cannot be helped, so why do I bother to torture myself over it?  Well the answer is easy, I can't stand not knowing everything, even the hurtful things.  **Sigh** I am so stupid sometimes!  What did I expect?  Did I expect him to have been a monk before me?  Of course not, that's silly, but I turn around and hurt when I hear that he wasn't.  God, what is the matter with me?  It's just that you don't expect to hear that your husband had once been the middle of a naked-girly sandwich right were you're sitting!  There is a lesson to be learned here; Never ask a question unless you really want the answer.  It's an old lesson, but has never hit home so many times, in so many ways, or with such impact as it has since I have been married to Matt.  Kristyn
