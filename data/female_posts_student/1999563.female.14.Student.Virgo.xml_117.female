I am really scared! Hahha.... Then I went right to rowing and I had the worst row I have EVER had in my LIFE. I was with Emily and these two other kids who where like going out or somethign cuz the whole time they were flirtying with eachother. It was SOO annoying. I wanted to throw 'em into the water :) And if that wasn't bad enough, they complained the whole row that they were tired so they stopped half way through and Emily and I had to row the 3 miles back by OURSELVES. GRR! I was SOOOOO mad!  *takes a deep breath*  Right after that I went home. They poured the concrete yesterday. So I packed my bag, changed clothes, did my hair, and stuffed a peice of pizza in my mouth. 5 minutes later I was out the door again! I went to Katies house. We went to the mall!!!!! It was SO much fun! Hahha...I picked out the skirt and shirt I am getting for the Sadie Hawkins. It is SO coool. Its pin-striped! Yay!!!!!!  Then we went home and watched Monty Pithon and the Holy Grail. It was Kaites first time! *wild applause* She now joins THE club!! She htought it was odd... *sigh* So we went to bed at 11-ish and woke up at 8. Then I ate a bagel and my dad came to pick me up. I went to go row. I had a much better row then yesterday!!!! It started to rain, though, which wasn't much fun.   My dad picked me up and we went to Fred Meyers to see the ocsar meyer wiener car!!! Hahha! It was SOO coool! We then went home and I took a shower. Then I went on the computer and that is where I am right now, updating my blog! :D  That is all!!!  Love, Laura  P.S.
