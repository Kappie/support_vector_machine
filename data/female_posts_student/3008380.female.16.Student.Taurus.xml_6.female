I hope you don't mind.  43 days...the countdown commences...  What fun, I have a fitness test tomorrow. Great, great.   Huebby actually told everyone to settle down today...twice! Holy cow, I hope he doesn't strain himself. Took a standard test. One question was something like: If you have an aquarium that is 32.4 feet in diameter, and 12 feet tall, how many gallons of water could fill it? I wanted to answer it by saying, "just stick in a hose and turn it off when full." I didn't think that would go over well, so I stopped being a smartass and wrote down 8 potatoes instead. And only after I turned it in, did I realize it was going to be graded.  And what do you know, Beach didn't even notice I wasn't at practice last night. Yahoo! Another plus; the corn is done! Today I got my very own rad hammer to help put together a fence. Awesome.   The Bulldogger comes out on Thursday and that will be my last issue for the year. Tear, tear. I truly love that thing. So much fun. I will never forget that class! And I hopefully will be made editor when I'm a senior. I hope.  Now I get to go head out to a frosh/jv choir and band concert, I cannot wait. I get to sit in the back w/Joel and make fun of all the freshies banging their heads and playing air guitar. AWESOME!   Tomorrow is St. Pattys day, and the only shirt I have that is green, I wore last Friday. I'm screwed. I do have green chonies, and green socks, but that doesn't count. I guess I'll have to wear some green pants or something. What a queer am I? I don't have a green shirt, but I do have green pants. Go figure. Enough of my wardrobe.  Well, now I'm just sitting here, jamming out to some NIN. Ya know, one really good book is Hard Love by Ellen Wittlinger. It sounds stupid, but it rocks. Its about this dude who falls in love with a lesbian.   I think I'm going to start writing a zine. I'll let ya'll know when I'm done.  And I'm spent!
