She is brave, beautiful, smart, caring, adoring, loving, funny, helpful, a survivor, a so much more.  She is my best friend, my nurse, my mom/dad, my confident, my healer, my best and worst critic.  She is an extraordinary lady that had lots of hurdles in her life and she went thru them with lots of dignity and grace.  She is the BEST MAMMY (grandma) and something Alex will say, the best mother in law.  I am thankful for her everyday.  Have a great day and.................Be Good
