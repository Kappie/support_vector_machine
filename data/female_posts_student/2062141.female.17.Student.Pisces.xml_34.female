Not only am I getting over what I was upset about before, there's no school tommorrow and this weekend's gonna be soooo fun! Me and Josh had a really fun 45 minutes getting orange juliuses... yaaay! And i found my missing Train CD!!! Yaay! But once again it just makes me feel more sad it's not summer. Siiigh.... you can't roll down the windows and blast the stereo when it's raining outside!!! No one else's window would be rolled down anyway... what's the fun if no one can rock out with you? Grrr. But it's cool. Cause I still had a most excellent day. HAHAHAHA oh yeah... coming out of the Factoria parking lot, me and josh hollered at these two reeeeally (ouch!) hot guys getting into their car and then hauled ass as they started following us... (lol josh: PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER, MAN!  "AAAA! Natalie I hope you know this place like the back of your hand, because we gotta lose em!"  ............."Okay they're gone....Aww... Now i'm sad... I was kinda excited...." Shit.
