We played Asshole and Fuck You,andI got pretty drunk, but no where near where I was on Robert's b-day. It was still awesome though. We played Spin-the-Bottle for awhile, but we never really did anything. Me and Andy sat on the couch while Beth, Robert, and Mande (she stopped by for a little while) were in Robert's bedroom. I can't even remember what we talked about... It made no sense whatsoever, and ever 5 mins we were like 'What were we talking about? Where did that come from?' And every time we heard something weird from the bedroom (strange noises or comments) we'd look at each other and be like 'we need to drink more' and then we would, and it was fun :) I think I talked to Andy more last night than I've ever talked to him in all other conversations combined. I asked him if he thought I was crazy -- he said yeah, but in the good way, not that bad way. Then Beth and Robert were geeking out about police and shadows and people chasing them... Robert made us turn off all the lights and hide in the dark in the 'safe corner' of the bunk beds. Andy and I just laughed hysterically, b/c it was prettydamn funny. They were drunk enough that they were loud and stupid, and they were stoned enough that they were hallucinating. Muahahahaha :) But anyway, finally we sort of crashed around 2ish (I slept on the couch w/ Andy... Beth thought it was hilarious), then Beth and I got up at 7:30 so we could leave before Robert's dad got home. Sat in my car for a few mins, then drove to a dif. street and sat there for awhile. Then we went to Burger King, sat there for awhile, and finally came back and sat on a dif. street, where a crazy guy stared at us. Then a little after 9 I dropped her off and came home. Blah. When I got home my mom was in bed and someone was in the shower... and my sis isn't home. WTF? Turns out to be my mom's 'friend' Don who is trying to get a job down in J-ville and spent the night here last night and now she's taking him around town and blah blah blah... w/e, I don't care anymore. If she wants to do things w/ other guys while dad's out of town that's her business, not mine. I'll just stay out of this one...
