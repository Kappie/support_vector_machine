Then it took my concentration away, forcing me to bargain with the associate principal of my school to waive half of my classes--which he did.  Now it has robbed me of my passion, the one thing that I could depend on to bring me some relief, the one thing that made it easier to get out of bed in the morning.  Gone.  Snap, crackle, gone.  My passion in life is/was dance.  It gave me peace of mind and happiness through its rythmic grace.  I loved the feeling of escape from my everyday stresses, delivered by the symphonic beat of the music and the body movements entwined into it.    Last night, I had my jazz class.  It is the only dance class I am taking because I couldn't handle my full schedule, which I feel is a weakness on my part.  But, whatever.  Anyways, I felt really out-of-sorts to begin with, like everything was in slow motion and I was one step behind it all.  I couldn't grasp the new dance moves to our Wonder Woman dance; I felt like jelly.  I felt my head swelling up, my face burning, my eyes watering, and my heart sinking.  Why can't I do this?  I kept repeating the same question, with each repitition more intense.  I quietly told my teacher, who knows of my recent condition, that I had to go, and she understandingly dismissed me.   As I was quickly walking to my car, the sensation of cool air against my furnace face felt sharp and harsh.  Tears streamed down my face.  Why can't I do this?  It's my passion--Why?  Locking myself in my car, I rest my head on my steering wheel and had a full blown panic attack.  I was bawling like a baby and screaming at myself.  If I can't dance, and since everything else has been taken away from me, what is there to live for?  I felt as though everything was slipping away from me, everything that I have worked for years to attain was vanishing right in front of me.  At this point, I was shaking with anger--resentment of this disease and bitterness towards myself.  Why can't I handle it?  In that moment, I knew I was a failure.  A failure to myself--all my goals that I have been striving for are gone, and I have no control over it.  I struggled to drive home.  Still bawling and screaming, with my anger now directed at God, I sped down the street.  I parked on the curb outside of my house and could physically and mentally not get myself out of my car.  My soul was shattered.  My mom had to practically carry me out of my car and into the house.  Eventually, with all the energy sucked out of me, I ceased crying, ate dinner, took my medication, and went to bed.   Pretty uplifting first entry, eh?  Today was a little better.  But I'm too tired of typing to tell you about it.
