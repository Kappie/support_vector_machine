Yesterday, while playing with my sister out in the back garden, my neighbours daughter (Robyn) was attacked by a local dog. Now, I know more than anyone how horrifying it is to see this happen and not be able to prevent it as I myself watched this happen to my sister when she was 4 years old- Although, the difference was that her face had not been bitten, only her arm.   I had been watching TV in my brothers room when I heard a high pitched scream and then my mother running out onto the Varanda with the house phone screaming " I'm calling an ambulance- put a towel over her face- hold it tight". I ran out onto the varanda with her and saw her mother crying and shaking holding the towel as my mother had instructed. I then flew down stairs in my socks, dived over a fence and was at her side in seconds. Her mother lifted the towel off and my heart stopped. This beautiful little girl that I had seen hours ago on the bus on my way into town was holding her face together with a cloth. Her sister ( 7 years old) stood crying a foot away, I ran over to hug her and tell her it was alright. I turned around and every child inthe block was stood sobbing hysterically for the wee girl.   The ambulance seemed to take an eternity. Robyn had been taken inside by her mother and could be heard sobbing from the front garden. She was so brave- had it happened to me I would be screaming the place down. The worst point I think was having to look for a piece of her lip and seeing all the blood on paving in our garden. We later discovered that the lip was still in her mouth and could be saved. However, it looks like she may need some kind of plastic surgery to fix some of the damage. The ambulance took her to the Victoria Infirmary then onto YorkHill Childrens hospital in Glasgow's West End. Later this morning I plan to pop down to her house and give some treats to the wee soldier.   Theres currently no news of what the dogs fate will be as the owner is on holiday. I'll keep you posted on Robyn's progress.
