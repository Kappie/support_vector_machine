I can come up with creative things and write out things better then to say something to someones face. But i have been running low on the creativeness for llike ever.  Usually when i come up with something creative i am in the shower and dont have enought time to write it down   and if i have the time then i forget most of it. I Guess i could put some of my poems. I think that when ppl write then it is usually pretty good but they automatically say oh its terrible. I knkow i do. I think that my stuff is pretty good thought. well just have to find out. well i am done for now. have to go. logging off really really really soon.                         bye.
