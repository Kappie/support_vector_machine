Maybe I am looking for other people to help me be inspired.  Maybe it is all of that.  Or none of that.  But the boiled down bottom line is that I'm not.  I'm empty inside, truly.  I even find myself missing Syracuse.  What a mess!  Maybe it's just the people I miss.  I was well-aware that that would happen.  *sigh*  I was unaware that I'd be suffering from an inspiration shortage this summer.  I thought this summer would be grand.  I'm not complaining, I adore DC (as anyone who knows me is aware), but I am feeling empty.  I'm just gonna talk to W on IM about my failed chase of S and do some work in oh, maybe half an hour or so.  We'll see what I feel like.
