My sister kept giving me kissy noises when John Patrick Amedori came on. (yes i know his name only to put it on here sheesh!) Shes such a moron...anyway i  am now known as Billpat. My friend and i were pretending to be Patsy and Eddie from Absoloutly fabolous(so upset its now off) and i was Patsy. Then we were like ok i want to be Bill from Bill and Ted's excellent adventure. So she is known as Teddie (Ted + Eddie = Teddie) and i am known as Billpat (Bill + Patsy = Billpat) yes its lame but its something we look into. Teehee...i guess you could call us mroons but meh! Must go now my ever shitting-me-kill-me sister is about to open the door and yell at me for being on this dam computer and argue some more about my homework and so on...even though i have done it!! SHEESH!! Nighty Night!
