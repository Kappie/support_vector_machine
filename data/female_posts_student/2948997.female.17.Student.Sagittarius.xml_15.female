Or maybe I'm just looking for a deeper meaning.   These days aren't getting any better, I dunno it just all sucks. Thats the only way to phrase it. I looked like shit today in class. Wild brown hair strewn around a chubby globe with two striking eyes and a disportioned mouth with a rather "british" nose. I smelt like landury detergent and such and dressed completely in black. I was actually asked why I was all in black: Was there a death? Am I paying tribute to Johnny Cash? Are you "depressed"? Actually the reason...isn't black supposed to make you look slimmer? Appparently not in my case. That bothers me, that what I wear makes people think something is wrong with me. Could I not just love the color black?  I'm an angry person, with sometimes nice tendencies.   Alright, the two bands that are the only things I will play as of lately:  The Beatles and The Barenaked Ladies. Something about them, is so appealing. I think it might be the lyrics...or the lack of recent shit influence. I had a friend tell me the Beatles were overrated. NO! The Beatle actually are one of the greatest bands in the world, next to U2 and...my favourite band the Tea Party (who doesn't love eastern mysticalness?)  Another note: If I email you, fucking email me back. I hate those incosiderant bastards who don't bother. You know what I'm talking about! And!! If you perchance are in the mist of being interested in someone...well I've noticed the signs of no interest from one party. Whatever. Fuck you. I'm not playing leap-frog cause theres no use. I don't need to be accepted and held that badly.   Kay, Soup is supposed to slightly of a liquid base. My soup isn't. Its chunky and kinda not soup-like. Call the SOUP NAZI!!!  I wanted to get my regressal of information out tonight before I was running on zero battery.  Anyways a couple more thoughts:  -good luck tomorrow Paulo and Dana -need to print my cabinet application -Martin is amazing to come and fiddle around with my settings on here -The Beatles fucking rock  Somedays I wish I was someone else.  Continuting with this thought, somedays I wish I could be Martin, or Katie or Jane. Somedays I wish I could trade all my bullshit for their bullshit. Just to become someone I admire. I'm just Kate. Nothing better or worse. And thats really sad. Like, I love myself...but there are days where that doesn't get you anything besides some 10 cent bubble gum and a cavaity.   My jaws sort of hurting now that I typed that.  So tomorrow I have a math test, which is bunk. And now...well fuck him. FUCK HIM!   Ben Wickstrom, today I was upset cause I sent you an email a long time ago. Should I just write you off now?!  Alan Campbell, wow. Would there ever be another chance. Lord knows I fucked it up really badly with you.  Dana Gregorie, I'm sorry for being immature and everything I shouldn't be.  This mysterious 20 year old who wants to meet me, I'm not having an expectations of you. Prove me wrong please.   We could call the last part of this the fuck post. Yes! Anyways. I'll keep on trucking if you keep on fueling me up. (no sense)  Salute
