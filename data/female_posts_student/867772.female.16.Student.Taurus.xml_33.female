Cassie's mom got me and my friends tickets this morning because otherwise, we wouldn't have gotten in, and we would've been watching some shitwad like Santa Clause 2 or something. I wouldn't trade that ticket for ANYTHING...the movie kicked elephant ass.  I love Eminem. Love, love, love. L-O-V-E......love. Get it?  That word looks weird when you look at it long enough.
