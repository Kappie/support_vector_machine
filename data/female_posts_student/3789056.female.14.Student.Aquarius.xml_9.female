I kept asking myself one question nowadays"am i being myself and am i always wearing a mask whenever i am not at home?" perhaps gos knows the answer but does he really? i am confused. it seems to me that i have been acting the whole time to compromise and to make people accept me, however, it wasn't me. maybe the above sentence sounds confusing! perhaps things would change for the better f only i could e myself, be who i am, and be the most natural me.??? Oh, this is really confusing. What am i suppose to do? The only answer that i had now is to stop acting and perhaps people would just accept me for who i am?? Will it help?I don't know. i just felt that i am being neglected in class and they just don't bother about my exsistance. I am such a failure. perhaps i have been blur for a few times or so on but most of the time i took notice of whats going on but i just want to ignore t.
