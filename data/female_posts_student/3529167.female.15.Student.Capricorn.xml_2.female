Wow this year has been...ummm...interesting to say the very least. I gained some friends and lost some friends....but hey I'm still here! I leave for Florida on the 11th, Ocala, Disney World, and Treasure Island here I come!! I got a shot today...it really hurt...Tammy (for those of you who know who i'm talkin about) gave it to me though she is the best! She did say it would feel like someone has punched me really really hard in the arm for a few days though...what sucks though becuase it just so happens i got it in the exact same spot lindsey punched me in a couple of weeks ago and the bruise just went away a couple of days ago!! :) Oh well!! Hope i get to see some of you guys over the summer... usally i sleep the summer away though. Still haven't decided whether or not i am gonna go to Faschyn's party...prolly should...but i prolly won't lol! I picked up my papers for Panama City today, yall need to go, its sooooooo much fun!! Well I think that about does it for now, nothing interesting has happened to me this week but i'll let ya know if anything comes up!! (For those of you who want it here is my cell...654-0393, gimme a call sometime!)  ~Courtney~ (Shortney)
