But a few days after that my best friend, Heidi, from NJ is coming to town.  This is a HUGE deal for me because...Well...I don't have too many friends...So when one of them actually come out here, it is a HUGE deal for me.  Plus she is bringing her family and I miss her little girls...I actually get to meet one of them for the first time.  Then not too long after they leave, my little Emmy turns one.  I can't believe she is going to be one.  I had her without Ed because he was out in Kuwait at the time.  That had to be the hardest labor...Mostly because he is my rock and when he wasn't there it was hard...I was scared and I think my fear overwhelmed me.  I love my family to death, but their reaction to being in the delivery room for the first time ( I didn't have them in there the other two times because I wasn't too comfortable with it yet.) well let's just say, it was funny after hindsight.  haha  So yeah my baby is turning one.  Time goes by so fast.  I have to plan her first birthday party, which unfortunately will fall on Valentine's day.  I may go with Sunday, so that more people are able to make it.  Also so I am able to do something with Ed.  We don't get to go out much, mostly lack of funds but sometimes just the lack of energy in me to go out.  So that might be nice.  As for the pregnancy, still spotting.  I am spotting more this time around than my first three pregnancy.  So I am a little terrified...Okay maybe a lot.  I am a worry wart, as many of you already know.  My first appointment with a real doctor is going to be on the 14th...So we will see...I will be able to give you a due date then.  Well I did my one good deed for the year.  I figure I should start the New Year right yesterday and I lent my sister some money to take her new girl out.  I know how special she wanted to make it for her, so I thought I would help her out.  I love my sisters and they love me.  I know this.  Sometimes we get into the most ridiculous fights, but in the end we are still there.  So I hope she has a lot of fun and that her Frisco trip is as romantic as she envisioned.    Okay, so I had a lot to just jot down...I hope to be a future writer, so I guess this really just helps me get things out.
