I really don’t think that I ever have, unless you count an almost unhealthy preoccupation with Keanu Reeves.  I have, however, witnessed obsessions.  I have a friend whom is completely, totally, unabashedly obsessed –capital O- with a woman he used to date.  She’s moved on but he just can’t seem to, admittedly I have often wondered what’s wrong with him…admittedly.    Still, I have always chalked it up to obsession and moved on.  I have witnessed both healthy and unhealthy obsessions… now I fear I have fallen prey to one.  I am hoping that it’s healthy, though who knows?    It would seem that I have become obsessed with the letter, K.  At first I believed it only to be a drive to have something –anything- personalized.  When you name is spelt uniquely, as mine is, you tend to want for what you can’t have, an off the rack personalized item.  I have seen Kristin,  Kristen, but never Kristyn.  Honestly I’ve had to give up the search for a ready made me.  Now, I have fallen prey to the wear your initial on your sleeve craze!  It all started very innocently with a $12.95 handbag at Target.  Then, Matt bought me a Sterling Silver necklace with a K charm –which I LOVE!  Then yesterday, while shopping for tea light candles, I came across sticky notes in the letter K, which I just had to have, and little white note cards with the letter K and pink butterflies.  They’re so darn cute!  Now, now it’s an obsession!  My first one, and I kind of like it.  Admittedly it’s not an unhealthy, painful obsession, but it is still one.  I am a little happy about it.  I love, LOVE all thinks K.  It lends to me hope that my search for a pre-packaged self is nearly at its end.  The generic K of Kristyn could just as easily be the K of any other name, the generic K turned into my own personal pre-made me!  One more piece of my ongoing search for self… may my search by long and fruitful!
