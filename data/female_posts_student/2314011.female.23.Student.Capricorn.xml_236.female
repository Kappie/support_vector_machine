He must have thrown out the 50 multiple-choice questions from a non-existing class.  Wonder if half the class is joining me this round, hmmmm...)  Criminal Law:  A-  (KICK ASS ALL THE WAY TO JERSEY AND BACK!!!!!  Okay, so this was the exam we all walked out of saying 'What the FUCK was that???' 'That was a 6 hour exam crammed together in 3 hours is what that was!!!!' and so on.)  Not bad, I have to say.
