Nodded off in Ballard until Ashley hissed, "LYDIA!" periodically. Drifted off at the hospital. Ellis is right, 4.5 hours will not get you anywhere.  Tiff, Butch from radiology really scares me. We were standing outside because we closed early today and he was outside too with another radiology crony of his, and they were totally listening to what we were saying and using that as basis for their own, independent conversation. We whistled, they whistled. Andrew and Ashley tried to show me how, and they just did. We pulled out our cell phones, they mocked us.  Mmm, some funny rumors circulating about me? Ah, but what are they worth? Anyone in his right mind would know that I am too much of an ascetic to do something like that. Jean would know. But I am vicious, I can't stop. Maybe it's little submerged incidences, and I just get lucky by giving up at just the right time.  When Doupe's serious, it scares me somehow. Usually he just says something off-the-wall and then either you laugh first or he snickers/chuckles in his odd little way. Or it's that you're supposed to be serious and then it's not a big deal. But when he chooses to keep a straight face, he all of a sudden looks as old as he's supposed to be. Strikingly abnormal.  Random pensamientos. I am becoming scatterbrained.
