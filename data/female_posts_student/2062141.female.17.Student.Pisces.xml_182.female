It is a 1 because I made dinner and it tasted good and I was proud. It is a 1 because I had a good talk with Charlotte because she's always there to listen. It is a 1 because the Simpsons, That 70s Show and Malcolm in the Middle are new. It's a 1 because I'm an idiot and need to finish writing out my rough draft. It's a 1 because today was on the verge of sucking and the potential to be good. I think.  I love this song, no matter how short it is.  Parachutes Coldplay  In a haze, a stormy haze I'll be round, I'll be loving you always Always Here I am and I'll take my time Here I am and I'll wait in line always Always.
