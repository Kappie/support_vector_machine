Captain Willard doesn't exactly judge Kurtz, Kurtz hasmet some soldiers over the past few years thatwas sent out for the missions. I think that Kurtz said that is because the soldiers went there before had judge him, so Kurtz said that is just warning Captain Willard.  I dont judge Kurtz, because he is living in a place that in uncivilized and he is not civilized, so i think in that condition he is just doing what can help him survive.
