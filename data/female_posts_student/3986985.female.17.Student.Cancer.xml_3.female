Very seldom do people see me... perhaps because i rarely reveal myself... but today starting now, i'll let you see me...  I had and have so many friends... outside, i'm a very friendly person.  But none of them has gone deep enough to touch me...my inner soul...    Although outspoken, i find it hard to tell somebody what i really feel... just like now...  People,especially close friends, makes fun of me and tease me a lot... it's fine with me... they don't bother me... for they tease and laugh to somebody who's not really me...that's why i don't care...or atleast i think so...  People, especially those who have known me think that i should and could do everything and anything... they don't know that i, too, get tired...  People, especially those are with me thinks i'm noisy and chatty... but inside i'm silent...alone...  People, generally, think that i'm a happy-go-lucky crammer who do a lot of tripping every now and then... they didn't know that it's my way of expressing my thoughts... cause they don't know how to listen...they don't feel me...they look right past through me...  i basically don't care if people can't see me... i just have to make sure that i'm still me... however, i'm waiting for somebody that has the capability to see me beyond what others can see... someone who can fathom my personality...  BUT WHO AM I?  i am nothing but average actually...  Define AVERAGE?  That's just the problem... but technically, i'm just somebody who wants to belong... without the usual trying-hards and smooth facades... i'm like the water... it can be anything it wants to be... given intense heat... it can be as light as air... intense cold... hard as ice... or it can be just as unpredictable as it is... just plain water...  Water can be a giver of life... a source of replenishment, however, it can be the giver of destruction, like waves and floods... I, on the other hand, can be both...  I hope i can get out... and i hope it's soon... soon enough for me to enjoy the remaining years of my life... and if ever i do come out... i hope they will understand...
