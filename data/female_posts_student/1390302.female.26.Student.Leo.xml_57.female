I mean, I know what I would really like to do, but how do I know that once I get started I won’t find it a bore just like everything else I’ve tried?  That’s why I’m 25 years old and still trying to graduate from Jr. College.  I feel like such a failure sometimes!  It’s stupid, I realize that I have years to live –unless a bus hits me tomorrow or something- but most 25 year olds are out of school by now.  There are students in my classes who are 18  19 years old.  What I wouldn’t give to be 18 years old again.    That brings me to my point, what would you give to be 18 years old again?  What would you give to take back all the mistakes you’ve made?  Sometimes I think it would be a dream come true, most of the time I just think that unless I know them what I know now, I would make the same damned mistakes all over again.  No, I know I would.  It’s a no win situation!  Okay, I’m both rambling and bitching, so, I guess I’ll stop.  But think it over…would you make the same mistakes if you could do it all again?  ~Kristyn
