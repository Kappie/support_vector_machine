I have moved beyond the scope of my closest friends, and it's felt like they're holding me back for a long time. I know I'm gonna miss them, but on the other hand, I can grow and move on in my new life. I can focus on new friends, who are on the same wavelength...and I can do so much more. I don't feel trapped or misunderstood anymore. I don't feel so alone, either, which is strange, since I'm saying goodbye to my friends. Any advice?
