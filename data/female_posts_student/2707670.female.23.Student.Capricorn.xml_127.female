We went home early because we all had to be up and at 'em this morning . Then I get a phone call after being home like half an hour and its him. He told me I should call him tonight and let him know what I was going to be doing. I told him he could call me and I might tell him where I was. Its funny that he didn't want to hang out until I ignored him. Playing hard to get really works. The thing is its not hard to get when you don't want to get them! We'll see if he calls tonight. Please don't let me do anything stupid like kiss him!
