We are too given to sharing this failure of imagination with our colleagues across the university.   I read Joyce's question as asking not whether undergraduates are  researching in our courses (of course they are) but researching in our *field* (pretty much they aren't, if our literature is any indication). I'm eager to see positive responses to this query, but I'll be shocked if there are many.  This lack of push for students to do research on writing correlates with a lack of majors in comp studies.  (We are, I think, seeing an increase in "writing" majors, which is wonderful, but lots of these still tend to have a how-to focus rather than a research-about focus.)  It's simply not seen as a subject of serious undergraduate study in the university.  This makes sense when you recognize that most of our fellow faculty imagine writing as a basic skill that enables other learning.  We wouldn't research multiplication tables; why research writing?   This is exactly the kind of attitude that makes me life so incredibly difficult.  And besides, we do research multiplication tables, along with every other system of organized cognition that anyone has thought to research yet, and dozens more that no one's thought of yet.  Interestingly, the notion of researching writing strikes many (based on my experience/research) as counterintuitive.   Counterintuitive? Wow.   Not only undergrads, but fellow professors have a difficult time imagining what "writing about writing" might look like.  Surprising to me, but the attitude seems to be out there.    And one final question--if we start expecting independent research of undergraduates, what will be expected of graduate students?  Of faculty?    Oh my God.  For fuck's sake. Certainly, by all means, let's not start expecting grad students to do research.  And definitely, let's not have faculty do research.  Wait, what's that you say?  Grad students and faculty  already  do independent research?  Oh.  Well, then by all means, let's not hold undergrads to the same standard.    It may seem like I took this quote out of context just so I could berate it, that its author couldn't possibly have meant what I think he meant.  Not true.  He meant it.  There was no context for this.    David Schwalm is certainly on target that a necessary condition for undergraduate writing majors to engage in authentic research is to be able to work with faculty mentors, who themselves are engaged in meaningful research.   Is there a paucity of "research" among composition/rhetoric faculty?  Really? Not in my department.  I suspect so. Again, David is spot on to note that institutional research can provide a wealth of opportunities--for faculty and students (both grad and undergrad).  But how much of this kind of assessment is really going on? Expertise in design, not to mention funding, may be problems--but none of those can be addressed until leadership for such activities is present.  Because so many of us were trained in the humanistic tradition, there may be a serious problem with comp/rhet leaders who are unfamiliar with social science-type research methods.  Really? Not in my department.   What might an undergraduate research project look like? [To answer Kaye Adkins' question.] For instance, a tutor working in a writing center notices that non-traditional students have some of the same problems as traditional-age students but also a different set.  As a non-traditional student herself, the tutor finds this interesting and sets about investigating by doing a review of literature, interviews of students (with IRB approval of  course--another area we tend not to be familiar with...), Really? Not in my department.  analysis of their work, interviews with faculty--and then produces three documents: 1) a research report; 2) a "tips for working with non-traditional students for other tutors; and 3) a "Tutor's Column" for WLN.  The student could apply for undergrad research funds and then disemminate through an on-campus Research Day or at a professional conference.   (Okay, another question: do undergrads present at CCCC? Fuck no. Grad students are barely welcome there as attendees, never mind undergrads prsenting.  Andrea Lunsford and colleagues certainly had a stimulating session this past year in which not only undergrads participated but also high school students.)  Yeah, good for Andrea Lunsford.  She's still a twit.   A second example: the director of WAC/WID wants to see if syllabi taht are designated with writing intensive really are writing intensive.  A team of undergrads working with the faculty mentors collect syllabi, create a grid for analyzing syllabi, and then review the syllabi.  Such an analysis might lead to a statement such as 55% of the syllabi that were reviewed by an oversight  committee demonstrate that writing is being taught as envisioned and approved while X% do not contain evidence that writing is being taught.  This would have implications for revising syllabi and thus feed back into improving learning on campus...and so on.  Other research projects might focus more on specific disciplines, say two students who want to get a sense of how writing  is taught in pre-health disciplines and how that affects the application process for medical school.   Quite clearly, faculty roles and rewards must include specific information that the work of mentoring undergraduates is important.  Otherwise, this is a lost cause.
