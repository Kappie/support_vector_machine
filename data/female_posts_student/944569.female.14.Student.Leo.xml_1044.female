Disney changes all fairy tales and are an INSULT to all cultures and movies ever made.  They change all stories to please little children.  Little mermaid is supposed to DIE at the end of the story.  She doesn't become a princess, she sees the prince with another girl and she kill herself.  Hades isn't an evil god either and i don't recall a girl named Meg in the myth of Hercules.  Cinderella didnt have pet rats either...Disney brainwashes children to make them think that Disney created fairy tales.  Some girl in my brother's grade (gr. 6) thinks that Disney invented Cinderella.  Hello?  Why is it that no one reads the actual fairy tales anymore?  Is it because they think that Disney tells the truth?  Pretty soon, they're going to try and change the fairy tales themselves so that kids who read them get happy sappy endings.    35) Favorite Fast Food Restaurant: ......  36) When was your last hospital stay?: When i was born.  37) What color is your bedroom carpet?: i have a wood floor in my bedroom   38) How many times did you fail your driver's test: never taken it  39) Have you ever been convicted of a crime?: no  40) Who sent this to you?: Jenny  41) Which stores would you choose to max out your credit card?:   Best Buy and Future Shop (all those anime dvds!!!)   42) What do you do most often when you are bored?: go on the computer  43) Which of your friends lives farthest away?: You see, i'm not very good with geography.
