According to Jackie O News on the Kyle and Jacki O Show the Beckhams have converted to Kabbalah. They were apparently photographed wearing the red bracelet. This trend seems to have gone nuts, so many celebrities are converting to Kabbalah recently including Ashton Kutcher, Demi Moore, Madonna, and Britney Spears.     Alexis on the Hot30 claims that Victoria has weaved some of David's hair into her hair extensions. I have no idea why anyone would say this about them but is a perfect example of the crazy things that the press will say to get your attention - well it got mine.
