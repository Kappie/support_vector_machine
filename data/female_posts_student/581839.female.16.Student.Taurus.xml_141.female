"oh my. tostado's are so cool. woo woo! watch out, they might poke your eyes out if you throw them around peoples faces." geez. man, who has seen the show on MTV called "punk'D" ashton kutcher is the host and he's wicked cute, and i love what he does. he tells people via microphones in the ear and tells them to go up to celebrities and play pranks on them. what a great show. well i'd better go. nothing good to do, but i'm pretty tired of typing, and i've got to go check show times for clone high and punk'D and other great shows.
