Then I woke up at 11 and found I missed my contact oppoinment so no new colored contacts for me!! Then we went to walmart and I got new glasses.  The lady said my head was so small that I had to shop in the kids department. Hah! I got like fisher price lenses. Its a little sad. :)  Then we went to the mall the return a shirt my mom got my at nordys that was WAY to tight.  It was crazy there!! There were so many beautiful girls there...haha. I mean really, they were. Everything on them was perfect.  Then, there I was with my old jacket and my baggie jeans.  But, I think I felt better then them...They probably had to get up at 4 to make sure everything was perfect! Hah! I woke up at 11 and we left at 11:10 and I still felt pretty. ;)
