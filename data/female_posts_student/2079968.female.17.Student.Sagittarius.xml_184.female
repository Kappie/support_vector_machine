Well yeah, not now. I'm happy...none of that stuff I said matters so much. I think I was highly delusional...or something. I dunno. But yesterday I had one of the best times ever...with a really great guy.  Oh, I fell this morning...my leg is so disgusting. It's all scratched up and the knee is all gross. Guess I can't wear shorts or skirts for a while. Also cut my hand and scraped my arm. It's gorgeous. Not really. More like disgusting.
