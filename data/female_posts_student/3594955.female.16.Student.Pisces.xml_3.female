Doh!  But hopefully I get accepted so I can travel to Italy on an exchange type program next year, halfway through 7th form. I talked to an AFS lady and she said that they send roughly 200 people overseas each year.   "So how many people have applied?" "About 200." "Oh Ok."  So the chances of me being accepted are good (I hope).
