Scary movies are by far the best movies ever! Especially if you go with someone who hates them (Jonathan). thats exactly why i wanted him to go with me! bc, i can play off of his fear. oh friends, this will be fun. hopefully he wont get sick and have to leave during the middle of it like SOME people!! i'm just playing Lindsay Owens! well people!! this will be a glorious day! and it looks like a storm is a'comin! so i'm off.  peace and chicken!  - anna g -
