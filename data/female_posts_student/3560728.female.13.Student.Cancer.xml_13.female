My time spent here has been pretty good. I've been reading, writing, and listening to music a lot. I think I'm going to go canoeing and visit the ranch later, which is always fairly entertaining. I'll write later!  (Written later) So I'm standing here actually inside the abbandoned ranch. It smells a lot like mildew and cow crap in here, but I'm starting not to notice. All of the structures here are infested with bugs, and are the homes to swallows. (the kind of bird that tried to attack me 15 minutes ago!) They make their nests in the rafters, and sing constantly. Anyways, I'm in my favourite building. There are actually more windows than walls in here, and I have no idea as to what it's purpose was, but somehow it feels safer than the others. The other buildings give off these sort of creepy vibes; probably because people actually lived in them. It's like being in someone elses home uninvited. This one wasn't anyone's home, and I feel like I can almost call it mine.  Paragons  Indigo butterflies surround me they flit in and out of broken windows, portals into the past.  I stand among the ashes of someone's life my ears filled with the music of the birds that sing of days gone by when this house was filled with laughter and no one dared to scry in the mirror they forgot of the past rejected the future and  immersed themselves in the present  I listen to the tremble of the dragonfly's wings and obliterate the lacy cobwebs that surround me ready to pull me in.  I think I'll leave this place undisrupted and undisturbed let it dwindle to the ground as wood splinters and rafters fall  I'll speak to my reflection in the water and hope that unrelentless time doesn't tear me apart...
