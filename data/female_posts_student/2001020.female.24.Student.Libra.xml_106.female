"Maybe he'll change," blah blah blah.  STUFF IT!  He's not changing, 'cause if he was gonna change, he damn fucking would've already!  *sigh*  Please punch me if I ever say those words.  Don't let me be a stupid, starstruck, idiotic girl who is willing to return to a stupid fucking relationship based on the "he'll change" premise!  I know I'm boy crazy, but I'm not all about boys every waking second of the day, am I?  I certainly hope not.  I don't mind boys being a part of my life, and I don't mind them being a big part of my life, but becoming a complete assface because of them?  Count me out!  *sigh*  My friends all hung out last night, and went to this girl SE's house that she bought not too long ago.  I asked my friend AO what everyone did afterwards, and she said, "Well, RO and I just went home, but RM and CF went to Jed's..." and I was thinking, "Well, no need to call me, I'll just be at home in my non-paired up existence."  Then I realized, when you have another person that constitutes an "us" or a "we," the rest of the world just doesn't matter.  You don't really *need* anyone else...and you don't see that you don't need anyone else, either.  Love makes you blind in ways that aren't always good.  When all of my friends are married, who will remember me?  I will still exist in my singleton (to borrow Bridget Jones terminology) life, doing singleton things, thinking singleton thoughts, and will be completely happy doing it until I am reminded by my the smug marrieds (again B. Jones) that I should be unhappy being alone.  *sigh*  I don't want to be the runt of the pack my whole life.  I mean, I guess I'm a pioneer in some sense (namely education-wise), but in terms of growing up, why do I feel like people view me as light-years behind everyone else?  Ack, what am I saying?  What is all this garbage in my head?  It's the Midwestern influence, weddings and marriage and proposals. This life is not for me, and I have nothing to be ashamed of.  Can I get a w00t on that?  I'm sick of vent blogging.  I'm going to try to focus on more, um, productive things, like, um, I don't know.  But I don't wanna be bitter for the rest of the night so I think I'll just sleep it off.  'Night.
