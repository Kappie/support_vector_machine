But after lunch I kind of gave up.  I took a nap and then wasted yet more time on Friendster.  I'm up to 14 friendsters.  Yay.  I even found some people from the fencing team at NU.  Ah, those were the days.  I attempted to Google myself yesterday (hard to do when you have a name like Jamie Clark, as there are millions of us), but I did find a link to the old fencing website that had my record from 1999.  1-6.  Yep, a grand .143.  Boy I sucked.  Someone this summer suggested that I start fencing again, and Michigan does have a club team, but I don't think it's worth my time.  I should find an extracurricular activity tho, outside of my Yoga and Butts/Guts classes at CCRB.  I'm thinking maybe Habitat for Humanity, although Matt made fun of me when I suggested it since I clearly don't know anything about carpentry.  We'll see how things go.    Today begins the new season of 007, the Friday night tradition where all the archaeologists start drinking at a bar around 5 and often keep going until the wee hours of the morning.  I think the latest I stayed at a 007 last year was probably 12, so my goal this year is to stick at least one out until the end.  It's kind of hard tho, because I'm allergic to cigarette smoke and Ann Arbor hasn't yet jumped onto the bandwagon of banning smoking in public places.  I didn't realize how good that was until I spent a weekend at bars/clubs in NYC and didn't have to worry about my eyes itching or coughing constantly.  And it's nice to get home and not reek of smoke.  Maybe I should send an email to my local city gov't person.  Whoever that may be...  Well, back to the formation processes.  Yippee.
