"Well I'm not getting the beer, I've only got 10p left on my credit card and I always buy everything." "Fine I'll get it." Ryan ends up spending Â£12-99 on a crate of beer. On his return he is horrified to find Jesse drooling over Hermione. "So, are we just gonna lounge around all night watching the Chamber of Secrets? Hardly a worthy celebration of getting a record deal," decides Adam. "You're right," says Jesse, "We should go rent out Spy Kids as well." "What the hell are you on Jesse?" mumbles Ryan, wondering how he got talked into watching Harry Potter in the first place. "Actually, I recently tried eating the plastic cover thing on new tapes.." "That was a rhetorical question." "Oh, sorry..." "Hey, this is the bit where the big spiders come.. wait for it.." says Mickey excitedly. "Will somebody switch Harry bloody Potter off???" yells Ryan. "NO!" Jesse emits a quiet yelp.  Nobody notices Adam is being unusally quiet.  "...I think she should straighten the hair.." "...I've heard that ceramic ones are good.." "...Dude, why are we, sorry, YOU, talking about hair straightening???" "Er, guys? I'm gonna take off now. To my room, i mean. I'm a bit erm.. tired." "What? But Adam, you haven't finished watching Harry Potter! I mean, the party's not over," says Jesse.  "I'm just.. yeh." "We're going to the studio tomorrow, by the way. Start recording." "Oh. OK." And he goes upstairs, and falls asleep immediately, even with the racket of "Nooo, it's a trap Harry!" from downstairs.
