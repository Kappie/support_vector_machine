Michelle kept WOOing as one by one people got dunk'd!! then amy and lindsay went to Scholtskzy's. MMMM, great food! then went stood outside AmStar debating on whether to go see The Village, Cindrella Story, or Bourne Supremacy!! I'd already seen Cinderella twice and The Village so we went to see if this time we could make it all the way through The Bourne Supremacy without Lindsay blowing chunks!! We indeed were successful! GREAT MOVIE!! I loved it. I cant wait to go see the next one. I'm seriously gonna read the books. I mean, i probably wont. But i'll try!! Well homies its off to bed. Have a day!!  Love you all,  - anna -
