It was one of those glorious hours when Britt let her guard down, stopped being so overly self-conscious and uncomfortable in her own skin, and just decided to be herself and let it all hang out. You can tell when she's like this from every aspect of her - the way she talks, how she dresses, the way she carries herself. I was in tears from laughing so hard at the off-the-wall stuff she was coming up with. And from this point on, "fish fry"shall bean insult to be dished out whenever possible. Britt is an absolutely fantastic and beautiful girl. Here's hoping that one day she realizes it.      Tonight's "entertainment" went by the name of Ben Hollis. Now, about 15 years ago, Ben Hollis created a local show called "Wild Chicago" that aired on Channel 11 and featured him in safari gear paying visitsall kinds of wacky and offbeat sights and stops around our fair city and surrounding suburbs. The show was great, and became quite a cult phenomenon. A few years afterward, Ben decided that he needed to move on to bigger things, someone else took the reins of the series, and it ran for a good long while. Well, those "bigger things" turned out to be him doing the exact same thing on Channel 50 for a show called "Ben Loves Chicago," followed by the exact same thing again on Channel 20, called "Ben Around Town." Last year, he put out a CD, and toured Borders all around Chicago promoting it. When he came to our store, he was part of a 5-manoutfit that was loud, not all that good, and all the time he was acting like he was hot shit.      Mercy, what a difference a year makes. The Ben Hollis who came in tonight looked a good 15 years older than the one who strutted his way into our fair store last summer. Gone were the beret (to cover up the inevitable march of time against his hairline) and the trendy black getup. In its place was the frazzled and balding look, a Hawaiian shirt with jeans, and half-circle glasses with a cord attached. One look at him made me picture a young boy saying to his mother, 20 years fromnow, "Mommy, should Grandpa really be going to the Jimmy Buffett concert all by himself?" Oh, in lieu of the 5-man extravaganza, this time it was Ben with an acoustic guitar, and his friend with a flute.That's it. Let's hear it for that bumpin' bass section! How 'bout them phat percussion beats? Awww yeah! He did about a 40 minute set with next to no audience response, and went on his way. One of the Friday night regs came up to me afterwards and asked me, "That had to be the shortest set I've ever seen here. Has he gone already?" I responded, "Yep, he just kinda disappeared off into the night without a trace." To which the customer said, "Wow, just like his television career." Ba-zing! I do believe someone has been taken down a peg or two. Fading star or not, Britt still wants to jack his Subaru and go joyriding around the suburbs, putting on a one-woman Thelma-and-Louise exhibition.      Business was slow, and the store was adequately staffed for once, so we all took advantage of the situation and spent a good part of the night wandering about and bullshitting with each other. Well, moreso than we normally do. After we closed up, I got the frisbee out of my car, and a few of ustossed it around the parking lot. All in all, a damn fine end to a lovely evening at our humble monument to commerce.
