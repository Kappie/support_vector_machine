The night started of innocently enough, after the Mr Fabulous drama I was a bit down so my friends decided to take me out… bad idea bad idea! We decided to go to boujis one of our favourite clubs (prince Harry goes here sometimes) so we had a few drinks at my Fennys and got dressed to go out I wore my cute new Matthew Williamson dress (yes, it was expensive but sooooooo worth it, sienna Milliar has the same little number in green) and my new irregular choice shoes with a Perspex heel witch remind me of Cinderella’s glass heels.  During our second tartini we decided tonight was our night NO MEN! Jer looked a bit upset but we assured him that as he was gay he could be one of the girls for the night!  At about 8 we got a taxi to boujis, we were all quite drunk as we had been drinking since 4 and suddenly the bloody taxi went over a speed bump and it was like hold onto your hindmarch totes girls.  It was no use the contednts of mine had fallen onto the floor of the far to full taxi, snap another Ollie and nick compact bites the dust, cigarettes on the floor looking like worms.  We finally got the club and sapphire had booked a table so we flashed are parents member ship cards and strolled in.  At about 12 I realized I may have had too much to drink  (sambucca is bloody lethal)  but so had every one else so we got the bouncer to flag us down a taxi while we sang “ I will survive” (oh god how cheesy!) At the top of our lungs.  I got home decided the stairs were even highr than a mountain so I crasehed on my mummy’s sofa which is her pride and joy as It was custom made by this fab designer, so she was not that happy to see my laying there this morning hung over.  Didn’t get in trouble though as my mum completely understood my upset over mr fab and sent olya my au pair (don’t ask y I still have one it makes my parents feel less guilty when they are away on business to know I am being looked after) out for the new Elle, ellegirl,vogue,glamour and ok, and after a lot of persuading a pack of silk cut 100’s.  So here I am board.
