I'm in such a good mood! I'll just say it's because it's a friday, and I know I don't have to wake up until noon or later tomrrow.   Hmmm... So I just watched From Justin To Kelly, am I a certified dork yet? Haha, I luv that movie. Hillary's not home, so I don't have anyone to bitch and tell me I'm a whore, Courtney's gone- sleeping at some friends. Yes, I have the house to myself, and it feels pretty damn good.   God, I feel like putting on a pair of boots, running outside and jumping in all the puddles the last two days have left. You know, just letting out everything that's been bugging me lately. Urgggg.. I hate the rain!  Anywayz, this weekend I have to party- I mean, really. And you know what, if I don't, I know I definetly will the next one.... BeCauSE... ::drumroll:: My cousins are coming!! Maria! It's gonna be so fun... next friday night, me and the crew are gonna take her out for a night in mclean!  So, I guess I'm going puddle jumping with the dog... haha! *~*Darcy*~*
