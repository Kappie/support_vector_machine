I do Customer Service for a telecommunications company, and the result is that I get yelled at, bitched at, whined at (and a number of other annoying adjectives) for eight hours a day.  But every now and then, I get to talk to someone really interesting.  Someone who's easy to talk to or just easy to listen to, and some people just pour their heart out.  Zigmund is one of those people.  He called in to see about buying service from my company, but he was out of the area we cover.  So he's called back every couple of months for the last couple of years.  Always to check on service availability, and very often just to chat.  We've talked about all sorts of things.  I've told him about my love for camping, he knows about Brent, (and now knows that Brent is no more,) he knows that I'm a student.  He was thrilled to hear that I finished my undergrad, and he had no idea that I minored in religion.  He was sorry to hear that Brent  I broke up, but encouraged me that there are other fish in the sea, and I don't need to rush into anything.  He encouraged me to travel, to go back to school, and to go to BC (he is passionate about his province, a land where mountains, forests and the ocean all come together.)  But I also learned something new about him.  He told me that about 15 years ago, he decided to become a yogi.  He broke up with his girlfriend Fatima and committed himself to celibacy.    "I bet you didn't know I was a guru," he says to me.  No, Zigmund, I did not know that.  Definitely not.  He told me about this guy down in Utah, Wiley Brooks.  He's a  Breatharian .  He's not just vegetarian, not just vegan.  All he drinks is rosehip tea and all he eats is the wind.  Crazy, huh?  All this guy eats is air, so I guess you could say that actually he eats nothing.  'Cause that's what air is, a whole lot of nothing.  How has this guu survived?  I dunno.  I read that Chuang-Tzu, one of the founders of Taoism, lived much this way: eating nothing, yet still living a long healthy life.  Zigmund says that a few years ago he trained himself to fast for 52 days straight.  He said that before you can do that you have to eliminate a lot from your diet, subsist just on fruits and veggies for many months, then cut it down to just fruit, then to just water, then to nothing.  Mind over matter, eh?  Anil just started yoga class.  I think I need something for my soul too, the question is--what?  Anil was telling me about deep breathing exercises...I should really try something like that, it's pretty non-commital, obviously low-impact.  I think I remember seeing an infomercial when I was just a wee lass about how we don't breathe as deeply or as often as we need to, and that with just four easy payments of $29.95 you can get a book and instructional video that will show you how to breathe and when.  I think I should be able to coordinate something like that on my own.  Sort of a like a non-dietary breatharian, hmm...
