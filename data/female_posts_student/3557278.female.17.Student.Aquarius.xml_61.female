I can't believe i'm halfway through my trial HSC exams!! I'm wearing my year 12 jersey!!! It's going to be over soon. That genuinely freaks me out. It's also cool though... soon I'll be driving and going to Uni and doing all grown up stuff. hrrmmm  I really like Dido at the moment....and about 500 other CDS, but mainly Evanesence (lol im so cheap i burnt it :P) Missy Higgins and also Pete Murray  OH yeah! I just remembered that today is the Bronze hike that i would have loved to have gone on, despite the fact that this group largerly consits of...... uhhh..... *cough* lovely*cough* year 9s. I can't believe that there are only 16 people left! that means that 12 PEOPLE DROPPED!!! OMG!! Yeah well we thought they were a bit dodgy. Oh well there are some really nice people in the groups and there will be a good bunch who actually continue. Plus they did write that really nice thankyou note hehe  but they are going to freeze tonight.........  Hmmm it's really windy today and on that note i am going to do some study :( Maths, Biology and Society and Culture exams next week. It's going to be so hard to stay focused after the trials..
