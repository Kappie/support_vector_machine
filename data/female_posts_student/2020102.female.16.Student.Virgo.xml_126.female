There's silence in your mood again Simple pain and lost remain Never shall they see this world Through the eyes that you've unfurled Jingling another path Devastating aftermath Along the silver mountain pass Shoving on transparent glass Mocking me, you seem to be Disregard this silent plea Deciphering your words and think Standing nearer to the brink Should I go or should I stay? Leaving all this earth's decay Every day I look for you Drenched with silver mountain dew Your mystery intrigues me so I see the silver side below Atop the mountain pass I stand Beholding all of life so grand Numbing me to my despair Wind is combing golden hair It seems the best of all began So I'll keep you while I can
