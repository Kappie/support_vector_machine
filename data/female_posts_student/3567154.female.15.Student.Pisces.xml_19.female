(Go and Support the Band yall) And now i am kinda sore like my hands are like majorly sensitive to everything. O well tho it was fun and worth it. Cassie Spence and here lil sis were there Melissa Stout, Elizabeth Tomason, Coutney and Kenzie Howard, Fishie, Danielle Stratkin (sorry i know the name ain't spelled right) and Jake were all there too. Of course T and Nan were there too.I kinda learned today that the girls that i thougth were awful arnt all thatawful.They are accutly pretty cool in there own way. But i am glad that we have the seniors we do cuz they are neat-o. But today was a lot of fun even if i did have to wake up at 7 to go there. I did get home till like noon but thats ok it kept me busy. I have to go clean house today to. But yea next week band starts. YAY pre-camp week is a busy one. There is a lot of pratice and a lot of getting used to the new freshman just like the upper classmen had to do to us last year.I remember not being able to read my drill the first day it was great. I wonder where Cassie and Kristelle shall put me this year. Last year Heidi put me where i was concently at the back of the feild but it was fun i could always find me. LOL. But i am giving up a concert to go to pratice this week i think sumtin is very VERY wrong with me. My mom got tickets to Seven Mary Three and i really wanna go but it is on Thursday and i don't really wanna miss pratice. O well there will be other concerts in my life. OMG Saturday is my family reunion and i like don't wanna go. But if i do go i have decided that i wanna take Jake with me. He might as well be part of my family. Sooner or later he will be they should just except it NOW!!! LOL. I am ok i sware. But yea my family reunions are boring and sin the only fun thing to do is go swiming in the lake. But even sumtimes that ain't all that fun. O well i shall survive i guess. My bro's b-day is the 1st of Aug. and that is the day i leave for band camp so i won't get to see him that day. O well he is a butt head anyways. But i should probley get going i have a bunch of work i need to get done.
