JUST LiKE THAT!! so, im left with broken pieces and empty promises. with a heavy... hurting heart, each day is a battle.  im surprised at how much stronger i am tho bec i usually ran after him and begged. not this time tho.   ...and daf, ur advice is just like everybodyelse's iLL meet someone new or something. i dont want anybody right now; i cant see myself going thru the same routine. wont i just be destroying what's left of me if i go out there with the "fishes"?
