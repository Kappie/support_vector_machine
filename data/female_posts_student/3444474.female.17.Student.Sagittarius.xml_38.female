Anyhow...  I saw Angel today too. He hadn't seen me in YEARS, and he had no idea it was me when I walked into the kitchen to see my mom, lol. It was rather amusing. :D  I love it when people don't recognize me, makes me feel good, haha. I've accomplished looking GOOD since the end of puberty.   I almost got a pedicure today, but didn't have the money in cash. I have my paycheck, but I'm going tomorrow to set up a checking account and put it in there. And I'll keep track of it this time, lol, I promise.   I think I'll get one tomorrow, hmm. We'll see. I'm in desperate need, lol. I hate it when my nails aren't done. I feel so icky, I won't wear open toed shoes. I know, that's dorky, but I can't help it, I'm very self conscious of my feet. Always have been.   Need to call Cameron. Need to talk to him period. I IMed his cell phone today, but what I got back was just jibberish from my computer, so text messaged him on my phone and asked him to repeat what he said 'cuz the computer garbled it, but he never responded. I guess he was busy. *sigh*  I'm such a moron, but why am I having doubts about it? I shouldn't be...he loves me...  I need to not think about it so much. If I do, I'll assume something that isn't true. I just want him here. I need a hug from him, I would feel better if I got one.   ...4...
