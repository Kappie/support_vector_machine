I can't believe that he thinks that his "girlfriend", although technically, they're not "seeing each other", is more important that me keeping in touch with my family. He doesn't understand that my family outside of this house is the ONLY thing that has kept my alive as long as I have been. I'm tired of life in itself. I really don't see how people live to be 80 years old, if I can't stand 15 years. The only people that I truly care about are the people that actually SHOW there love for me. In case you didn't know this, NOBODY in this house shows their love for me, and if they do, they have an extremely odd way of showing it. The only reason I stay here is because I have to. Oh yea, they feed me, too. There's another reason I stay. But then, they feed me all I can eat, and then tell me I need to lose weight? What type of bullshit is that? When my mother found out I lost my virginity, she called me a whore. So technically, by what this family has called me, I'm a fat whore. Oh fucking well, they'll have to deal with it, because I'm happy just as I am.I don't see any reason in trying to improve my body. "God" created me just as I am, and if they don't like what "God" created, then they, therefore, aren't as devout of Christians as they appear to be. Oh, and they thing that I'm the "problem child." The one thing thatI hated most when they found out that I had lost my virginity was that they knew that Robbie had fucked an ex-girlfriend, AND THEY DIDN'T CARE! Yea, they even used the excuse that I could get pregnant and he couldn't. Sure, he can't get pregnant, but the child would still be his responsibility, but they wouldn't care. If I were to get pregnant, I'd get kicked out of the house. God forbid that Robbie not have a place to live. He's a queer fuckwad, and not worth my time. He thinks that he can play God to me. Well, I have news for him, we don't serve the same god anymore, buddy. I don't look up to you as a role model, because you're not the type of role model that I need. I need somebody that can teach my what I want to learn. I need somebody that knows a little something about what I'm getting into. I know some, but not a lot. Nobody in this house fits that description. Sure, my mother may be able to find out a lot, but big whoop-di-do! All she would do is find stuff that Christians have written against the religion. It would all be biased, and I need something that looks equaliy upon both religions. Well, I've got to get going.
