I got my pic taken with her, although they made us do it in groups of 6-8 and everyone was vying for a place on her side.  I could care less where I was, I was still within a couple feet of Sandra, and plus I had red wine, so I was occupied.  Then a group from section B, none of whom I really knew invited us to go to Chilini's- aka the single "Mexican" food restaurant in Austria, rather pricey, which as a San Antonio native I found amusing.  So we ordered Margaritas, and I still didn't have an appetite thanks to my case of SARS (bronchitis really), so I had my frozen margarita and drank it fairly quickly.  So everyone was commenting on how strong the marg on the rocks was, so I ordered one....can you see where my night was heading?  Yes, so it was tequila, with a splash of sweet and sour for color.  I am still not sure how I drank it, maybe I had more wine at Sandy's party than I thought?!  I hate tequila, but anyway, then we decided lets go the the Hofgarten [keep in mind I had Cochran the next morning at 8am to discuss transnational litigation].  C. had never been, and I have an admitted weakness for it, and well I haven't gone out in Austria since week one, sooooo....famous last words.  Needless to say about 90% of the class during Sandra's lecture today was hurting.  Anyway my case of SARS [bronchitis] has resurfaced full force thanks to Rachel's stupidity in staying up all night long, in a little dress, stiletos, and this flimsy wrap.  It was downright cold last night with wind and rain.  Fun.  Anyway.  Sleep good.  By the way, if anyone knows my parents, why did everyone in my whole family, extended family included decide to go to New Mexico?  How long?  Why?  enigmatic.
