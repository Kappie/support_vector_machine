OH MY GOD. congratulations babz! you´ve just managed to walk naturally avec des chaussures en tallon! en 6 cm! i havent been walking on those for ages! hahaha, i´m great! i´m just great :-D millions of women walk on chaussures en tallon en 10 ou 12 cm et c'est ordinaire. je suis en moyenne. whatever.  mom, please, please don´t let me down! you wouldn´t even get close to the importance of that with your thinking, you would never guess what it would mean to me! unless i tell you ... please mom! aide-moi! i´ll absorb every word, my french vocab. will become abundant... then, after vacation i´d sign up for either italian or spanish lessons. i´ll choose spanish i guess.  mom, so...well, i know you´ll never read that because i don´t want you to. you wouldn´t understand anyway [because of the lang.] i think you don´t have quite a good opinion about me, well maybe you have. i don´t know that but i´m not as insensible as you say you think. i just elude because that´s what i think i have been taught living in that family.  mom, i´m not the only one, your youngest daughter is slowly eluding too.  mom, my den is everywhere but here. i feel sorry about that. i really do. and i know that you feel that. but i dont know if you know that. and if you do i don´t know if that knowledge hurts you. why, i hope it doesn´t.  mom, i know i´m not what you wanted me to become. i feel that you are disappointed. i promise, i´ll change. someday i hope. mom, i know you feel betrayed and disappoited because of everything although you mask that by keeping your head up. for that i respect you and i feel this barrier: i won´t tell you all this, i´ll never comfort you, i´ll pretend not to see your agony through that mask. i won´t tell you that i love you, i hope you know that i do.  mom, all that is because i wear a mask too. and i dont want you to see what´s behind that mask.  mom, your birthday is like 4 or 5 days away. you´ll turn 44. you are a beautiful woman, mom. people say you look like you´ve barely entered your 30s. this is true. i hope i´ll be like you when i reach this age. your daughter babz
