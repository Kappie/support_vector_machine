No joke, there were at least 10 bumblebees and wasps flying around the back patio. I even saw two crows perched on the roof of the carport. I think it's supposed to thunderstorm later. I look forward to that.  I just finished watching "Office Space"; not really my kind of comedy, but there were things about it that I could appreciate. I don't know. There are some things that no matter how clever or funny or well-timed they are, they still just don't quite strike me the right way. It depends on what kind of mood I'm in. The dvd for the movie sucks. It had something at the beginning that was like "Press ENTER to scan for a virus", and when you press ENTER it brings up a screen that detects a virus and then takes you to the menu. There is nothing extra at all. They have a list of the actors in the cast and the trailer and that's it. They can do a little better than that. Maybe I'm being too critical.  I dyed my hair on Thursday afternoon. Very spur-of-moment. Mary and I were at Eckerd's, and I said to her, "I think I'd like to die my hair." And she said, "Well, why don't we get some stuff and do it now?" And so we did. It wasn't too drastic. It just looks a little darker and redder. If anything, it makes me look like what Ellen used to when she would die her hair like this in high school. I knew that it wasn't drastic enough for people to notice for the most part. But good ol' Becca noticed the moment she saw me at lunch. I love that girl. I think I might get something brighter and do it again. We'll see. That makes me the fourth in my immediate family to do something with red. My mom did it first, then Ellen, then Mary, and now me. I don't think my dad will ever do it.
