I got him 2 shirts (one said baseball on the front and had a bat and a ball, and the other one is green and says lucky on it) and the Linkin Park cd. She got him an outift, boxers, a bathing suit, the nickleback cd, and socks. (dont ask... i dont know) So, we came together and picked out a "gag" gift for him. We found this awesome baseball bag. Then we bought him a pickle card (inside joke... again, dont ask) and signed it. We bought him a thong, which he has to wear on the beach in FLA, some spaz juice (again, another inside joke) and something else... but i dont remember what it is. *lol* We got to his house around 2, opened presents, left at 3, picked up Jeremy's mom. Went to the bowling alley, met up with the rest of his family. Thats when I met Jeremy and Amy (a.k.a. "Brown Eyes"). Jeremy is really hot, and funny... So we went to laser tag, in which we got KILLED. Lauren kept shooting me (and I was on her team) on accident and shooting herself. *typical lauren* Then we went to Ryans and ate. Then we went to the movies. (it was 7:15 by now) We decided to go and see White Chicks, but it didnt start until 8:10. So we walked over to Barnes and Noble, then went to the movies again. We got in and it filled up FAAAAAST. So we left there and went to see 'The Terminal.' We sat like *Jeremy, Me, Justin, Lauren, and a seat over was Amy* She was feeling left out... We left the movie before it ended, but its ok. Then Jeremy went home (he didnt say bye to me, he will die the next time I see him) and Ms. Debbie took me and Lauren to her house. And we talked to Mrs. Lynee for a while, ate a snack, and then went to bed. It was such a fun day/night.
