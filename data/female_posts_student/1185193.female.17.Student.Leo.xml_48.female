I bet most of you didn't know that I've won first place in two essay contests (and have submitted two more to win scholarships for college), have had a poem published, and have been told by all of my English teachers that I have the natural gift of eloquence.  So, that's why I have added the "Currently Studying" section to my right column.  I just went to the caf√© today (hence the new name of my blog) and outlined my plot, complete with all the components I have studied about: setup, rising action, reversals, recognition, climax, falling action, and denouement.  Pretty neato, eh?  The only element of my story (which is different than a plot, I have learned)that I can fill you all in on is that the main character's name is Ava Flom.  That will just have to satisfy your inquisitiveness for now.  Back to the old writing board...
