I don't think it was as scary as some people said it was. I mean, the only part that would scare me is right when the guys pops outta nowhere! But when he is out there and just like chasing them and stuff, I'm not really scared. lol Jessica Biel is a good actress, I wish she was in more movies. She was the only survivor and she had to like put 1 of her friends out of misery. That's horrible. I wouldn't know what to do, I could never kill a loved one or I don't know if I could ever kill anyone. But I think if someone killed a very close one like a loved one such as a parent or something and they did it for the heck of it, well that doesn't matter, if they did it. I'd give them the worst life ever if they didn't end up dead by me or someone else. That's just so sad. Anyways, we also watched Mystic River, about murders also. It was good. Both of them were, Texas Chainsaw didn't have much of a story line, I didn't expect it to. I looked up the "based on true story" story. It was based on a guy named Ed Gein and he did some cannablism but he didn't use a chainsaw, the guy writing the story came up with that, anyways, Long story, I'll tell you later if you want to know. But Mystic River was good, kinda sad because of one thing but I can't give it away, you'll have to watch it! Well, there are some movie reviews for you. What else can you expect from me? haha I'll get back on this later. Aloha
