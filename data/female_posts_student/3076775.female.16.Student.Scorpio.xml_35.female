We're out of school now, and I'm supposedly happy about it, but I don't feel very thrilled about it at all. It's a funny thing. I'm so close to tears right now, and I don't know why. Being depressed really sux. I was really depressed earlier this year, but got over it, but now I feel depressed once more. I don't know why!!!!  Chelsea and April are going to camp soon. I won't see them until school starts back. Hell, I probably won't see Nick until school starts back, either. He probably won't care though. He told me otherwise, but I just get the feeling that I'm crowding him, that he just doesn't care to see me anymore. I don't know!!!!! It's really upsetting, and the worst part is, I have no real evidence to back up my feelings. I'm just too freakin paranoid. I know I shouldn't write all that and upset the people who read this, but I don't think they really read my blogs anymore anyways, so it doesn't matter. I just don't know what to do anymore. Summer is supposed to be fun!!!!! I swear, I'd rather be in school for the rest of my life. At least I'd be busy and have SOMEONE to talk to.  All I've been wanting to do this week is cry and sleep. Either sound appealing at the moment. I'm just being stupid, I know, but I can't help it. Gotta get this frustration out. I'm going to go now, and maybe I'll be in a better mood later today and post more.  Love, Shannon (no quotes today, sorry)
