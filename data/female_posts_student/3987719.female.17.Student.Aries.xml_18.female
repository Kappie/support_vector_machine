With a win and a Cubs loss the Cardinals would get there 8 game lead over the second place Cubs back.        The Cardinals won 10-4 in convincing fashion. Down 2-1 heading into the 3rd inning, Reds pitcher Jose Acevedo didn't know what was coming. Edgar Renteria led the inning off with a solo homer and after that Acevedo unraveled. The Cardinals ended up knocking Acevedo out of the game after 2-2/3 innings with scoring 5 runs in the 3rd to take a commanding 6-2 lead that they would not surrender. After the 3rd the Cards were a bit quiet until the Reggie (reggae) Sanders led the 5th off with a solo shot of his own off the Batters eye club 430 Ft away from home plate in dead CF. Then in the top of the 6th Renteria walked, Pujols beat out a single and the Cards RBI machine Scott Rolen drove them both in. In the end the Reds only got two more runs in thanks to Jim Edmonds who once again threw someone out at the plate. Simply the Best.
