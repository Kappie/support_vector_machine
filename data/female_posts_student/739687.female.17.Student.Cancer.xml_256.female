And I'm so sad and pansy-ish when I'm sick. *sobbing, whining, moping...that's me.*  Oh, also I was talking to Rachel and I came up with a constant, and mostly accurate (though not completely), name theorem.   The Name Theorem    Part One:     Guys with a first name containing four letters are hot.   Some famous examples:     Brad Pitt                                               Sean William Scott                                               "Drue" from "Flying Machine" *hell yeah...what a sexy man*    Part Two:     Girls with a first name containing six letters kick ass.   Some of the best examples:      Shauna Zajac                                                     Rachel Hendrix                                                    Amanda Carter    Part Three:     Guys with a first name containing six letters are not very cool.    Part Four:     Girls with a first name containing four letters are also not very cool.    Note: Parts One and Two in comparison to Parts Three and Four can be referred to as "The Opposite Factor". You see, the opposite of "cool" is "not cool", therefore the opposite number of letters in a person of the same sex must be opposite in character traits.    Part Five:     All persons with a first name containing any other number of letters are indifferent. No one really cares.    Part Six:     A six:four or four:six ratio is a damn good combination.    Note: The Name Theorem is somewhat erroneous. If you believe an error has occured, go back and re-check your work. If the error is not in your work, then please consider that The Name Theorem may not necessarily apply to you. And then again, it just might.    End.   Haha yeah. I get pretty bored. No, don't be some bitch/asshole if that offended you. I wasn't going for offensiveness, so chill and go shoot yourself or something.  Well, that's about all I really have to say. Catch ya later crazies.
