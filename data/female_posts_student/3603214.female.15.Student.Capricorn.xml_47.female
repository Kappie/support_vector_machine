Anywho, I believe everyone needs to be forgiven to an extent. Lines must be drawn though. Emotional abuse isn't necessarily forgive and forget. It lingers. Which is why I think my mother needs a wake-up call. It's not gonna work between her and my father. She has everything written up, ready to go to the lawyer, but she's all talk. Kinda like me. I have corrupted my parents. Not the other way around. I became my own person, and ruined my parents' goodness. Maybe it WAS for the better *shrugs*.  I Love the 90s 1998 made me realize there's no love for the furby because they don't shut up. I guess it's a good thing I didn't have one or else I mighta been more evil and abusive because I would've tried to kill the furby.  At my party, as we all know, we danced in the rain. Since me n Tasha are only happy when it rains *w/a song btw*, we shoulda made a rain dance n if everyone at the party would go outside at the same time n do the rain dance, it'll magically rain. And that would kick ass.
