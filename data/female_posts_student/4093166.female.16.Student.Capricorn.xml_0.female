There were a few parts that made you jump, but it was mainly normal.  Who ever wrote it was a good writer.  It had a lot of irony, and the end was full of suprises.  My opinion, if you can, you should go see it.  Today was the first time I have been to the mall in a LONG time.  I saw soo many people I knew, it wasn't even funny.  Half of them I don't like, so I guess that really doesn't matter.  After the mall, we went to a mexican resterant and stuffed myself.  I know that makes you fat, but I didn't care today.  I'm gonna lose weight in band camp anyway.  Ohh, and a BIG HI TO ED!!!!  I know you're going to read this so I figured I would say hi.  Anyway, I need to go burn some calories but it's dark outside, I don't want to get kidnapped, lol.  I guess it would be teennapped now.  Ohh well, I need more people to start readin this so I can have more posts, they're like opening presents.  Lol...  Well, I'm going to go and run around in circles now. L8er, Jami
