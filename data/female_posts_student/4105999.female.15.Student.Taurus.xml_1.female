Wow there were these two guys (twins) in my sunday school class today that were really cute i hadnt seen them before but josh linc said there gonna be sophomores but that all they were doing was playing the guitars for the week to fill in for Mark Westman (our pastor, who also plays the guitar on sundays at our church lol)..BY THE WAY EMILY WESTMAN I MISS YOU BUT I HOPE YOUR HAVING FUN IN CHICAGO!!! then after sunday school we had service and after service i stayed for a little and helped set some stuff up for vacation bible school which starts tomororw night. So that was fun .....but then after that was all done my mom came and got me  my sister  we went with our parents to go to my grandparents for lunch and to stay there for a couple hours. It was nice to see them  all but it was pretty boring cuz after lunch they just stayed out side the whole time talking to my parents. So me and lindsey basically just watched tv, played with my moms cell phone. After a while i called crystal though..talked to her for a little bit then hung up with her cuz we were leaving..then in the car i called her again and talked to her until i got home...okay so wut do you think..would you rather listen to the beatles??(and other oldies)  or kenny chesney ( other country) i say kenny and others but crystal is all for the beatles and oldies lol so tell me wut ya think!!! BUt i dont know what im doing tonight if crystals parents come home she MIGHT stay over here or i MIGHT stay over there but who knows...........well thats it for now..leave me some comments!!! ~*Bre*~
