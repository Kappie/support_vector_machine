I bet you I'm gonna forget  everything  cause I suck at that kinda stuff!   I really hope my friends in my cabin and not have all those creepy people who need special attention ( if ya know what I mean ) So now My mom's yelling at me to get off the computer so I can go pack. She's being a bit of a narcotic right now and its starting to piss me off. So I have to go and finish packing.... You probably won't be hearing from me in awhile :(       ~Rachel
