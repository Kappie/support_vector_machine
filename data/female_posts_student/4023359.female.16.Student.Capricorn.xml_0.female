I got there, made two things of sweet tea and one unsweatened, made 2 reg. coffee pots and two decaf. coffee pots, fixed the coke dispensers, stocked b-fast stuff, changed the hash brown/fry vats, started taking orders, had to take orders, fill orders, and take money all at once by myself until 7 in the am. Then, i went to drive thru money take booth until about 11:30, went on break, got back, went on fries for maybe 15 minutes, went to order take, stocked, and then finally left. That's all there was to it today. lol gotta go!!! buh-byes!
