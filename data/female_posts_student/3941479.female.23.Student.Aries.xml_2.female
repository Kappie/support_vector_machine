Now we're on to the rest of the semester, not looking too bad although the workload is up on last semester.     I still can't believe how much God is working in my life at the moment, he just gives me what I need to carry on and I really think he's reaffirming that teaching is one of the purposes he has for my life. It's reassuring to know that I actually have a direction in life, finally! I feel really settled and I hope that everyone has sometime in thier lives when they feel as full as this because it's awesome!!  I was reading over a few things I jotted down before I became a christian the other night the change I've experienced has been pretty steady over the past few months. I guess I haven't really noticed it but when I looked back over what I had written my words are quite different now, my whole attitude in my writing seems to be a lot more focused, a lot happier and less worried about things that I have no control over.
