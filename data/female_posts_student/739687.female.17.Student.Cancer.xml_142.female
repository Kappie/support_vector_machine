I'm gonna go shopping later, for my last minute Christmas shopping.  The other night I got to thinking about, just, everything...and I realized that I don't have anywhere to turn anymore. I'm just...horribly empty. And I know I'm finding my "contention" in all the wrong places, but I don't have too many options anymore. Meh, who gives a shit.  Bye crazies.
