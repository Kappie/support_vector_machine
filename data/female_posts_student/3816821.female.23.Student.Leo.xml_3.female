Recent development on the site surrounding the lift tower, and reports that houses may be built close to the base of the tower itself, seem to show that the tower may be safe from demolition. The lift tower has a grade II listed status, due to the fact that there are no other buildings like it in the UK. It closed in 1997, and has stood unused ever since. In 2001 began a fight for survival, when the owners at the time applied to demolish the tower. It has also been reported that the tower suffers from "concrete cancer" and requires extensive repairs to stop it from eventually collapsing.    There are conflicting opinions about the tower. Many local people see it as a symbol of Northampton. I know that when I've been away, I know I'm home when the lift tower appears over the horizon! It is certainly a recognisable aspect of Northampton, and a longstnding part of the skyline. Unfortunately, the tower is disused, and does not really have any other viable business uses. Surely Northampton has more to offer than a derelict lift tower?!! My own opinion is that something needs to be done, either to incorporate it in someway with the current developments around the site, or otherwise we need to pull it down. Otherwise it will loom over us as a sign of the end of an era of British manufacturing. It will become an eyesore if something is not done soon. I'd like to know what other people think, so please feel free to post your comments. What do you think should be done? Can you think of any viable uses for the tower? Also please take the time to vote on the issue!! Thank you
