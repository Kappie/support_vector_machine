One person that will be by your side? One person who you fall in love with all over again each time you see them? One person who is   your everything?         It's weird that I've found love so young. Is this it? Is he the 'one'? Is he my soulmate? Is he the one I will spend the rest of my life with? He is the person I love unconditionally even of his faults. Is he the one that be by my side? He is the person I fall in love with all over again each time I see him.   He is my everything.         Is it possible to be in love at this age? Falling in love is possible at any age. Never puppy love to me. It's either  Lust  Or   Love.   I fell in love at 14 and 2 1/2 years later here I am, in love more than I was before. Falling more and more, deeper and deeper in love with him. Knowing all along he's right there with me, behind me in everything I do. Loving me for who I am.  This is love .      Love has thrown obstacles that we've only defeated, coming out stronger than when we went in. I can only hope for more defeats and a stronger relationship.   Together we are everything  .      The time  we spend is priceless .  He is priceless .   He is the  one I fall in love with over again each time I see him  . He is the  person I love unconditionally even of his faults .  He is my best friend .                                                                                 He is my everything.                                                                                                  I Love You.          Jaimie          -Dan, you aree my everything. You are the one I love and will forever. Thank you for everything you have done for me. :)     I love everything about you. You still ROCK my World :) (Even when we're down and dirty) lol.
