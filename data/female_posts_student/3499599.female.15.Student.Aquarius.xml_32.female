Serena follows law of the jungle  Fri Jul 2, 9:42 AM ET    By Bill Barclay   LONDON (Reuters) - Serena Williams graduated to the Eric Cantona school of sporting philosophy at Wimbledon this week.   "The lion is the king of the jungle, but the tiger is the king of the forest" -- that was the reply the defending champion gave when quizzed about her prospects for Saturday's final against Russian upstart Maria Sharapova.   The befuddling comment recalled the famous retort of French former Manchester United soccer player Cantona to reporters: "When the seagulls follow the trawler, it's because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea."   Nonetheless it did take Serena a couple of attempts to get her philosophy right.   "I will prepare in a way that I will not tell you," she told reporters with a mischievous smile.   Asked why, she replied: "Because the lion is the king of the forest but the tiger is the king of the jungle."   Realising her error, the 22-year-old American hurriedly corrected herself.   "I had it mixed up the first time. The lion is the king of the jungle but the tiger is the king of the forest," she said.   Asked why she was not playing the doubles this year with sister Venus, who lost in the second round of the singles, Serena hared off on another tangent.   "I just had a deja vu, that's weird," she said.   "I dreamt that Venus lost at Wimbledon and somebody asked me why we didn't play doubles. Then I was playing this young girl in the final. Isn't that weird?   "I always have deja vus."
