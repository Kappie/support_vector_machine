       
      I got up at 6:26am-6:30am this morning, having gone to bed around 1am (or somewhere around that time, anyway). That's 5 1/2 hours. Yes. Just an observation. I guess that will come in handy at Camp. Now I just need to throw in some regular exercise so I don't pass out after hiking half a mile to the dining hall...   Also, in case you're wondering why this journal is so friggin BORING it's because the one I use to write my actual feelings in is here: http://livejournal.com/users/oracular_echo
