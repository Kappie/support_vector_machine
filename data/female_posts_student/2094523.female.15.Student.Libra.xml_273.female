But then again.. sometimes there is a poitn where things are too fucked up to be fixed.. and that is what our world is. I dont think the world screws it self up i think its the people placed on this world that make everything a mess. Maybe the world would be beautiful if there were no humans on it. maybe it will finally be that utopia we all hoped for.. we wudnt be alive to enjoy it.. but hey it would have been beautiful.   Maybe when you're angry all the time its kinda a sign to tell you that you need therapy.. a psychiatrist or something along those lines. ANything to keep you from bashing your headagainst the wall.. i dont think its very healthy to be that mad all the time.. Sometimes when you crave sympathy all the time.. the last time you're ever gona fuckin get is sympathy. Don't you see?  that bringing others down won't make a difference amongst your misery. Don you get it.. its huring everyone aroudn u. why can u just hurt yourself and keep us out of your miserable life. coz we dont need it. the world is already screwed as it is.
