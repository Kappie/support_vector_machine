My dad is such a dork and if you knew him you would understand it...haha  We are going to get a gate so that Stich does not tear up the frickin' back yard.  Kawaii will be leaving us soon.  She is a great dog, very cute, but the two together is just too destructive.  Stitch happens to be Ed's dog though.  LOL  Oh well.  Then we saw the stones we need for the backyard.  I don't know if we are going to get them because it might be expensive,  but we will see.  I am not so sure.  We will see.  Oh and by the way I am watching the Iron Chef and the guy in the red definitely resembles my dad.  HOW FUNNY!  I think I am going to try and get some sleep.  Wish me luck.
