Oh i know what's funny. Mr "english teacher" stands behind our "asian group" because we talk and its great. hmm what else  Oh today is the nineteenth by the way i decided to like ...not write? i dunno i'm really tired right now and its late. I'm analyzing a poem and my silly goose... nevermind he came back... hehe he's so awesome! i love him! okay yeh i should go though.. bye!
