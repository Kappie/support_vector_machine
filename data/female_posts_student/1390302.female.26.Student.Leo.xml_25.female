When we loose our keys, chances are we are going to find them, this is not the sense of loss I am talking about.  I’m talking about that sense of loss that could have been prevented, that sense of loss that could have been stopped or detoured.  Senseless, superficial loss, nothing so dramatic as death and yet I have been thinking that this is a day to day thing in the world.    For example, when we loose a friend –a topic I have come to be an expert on- that friend can never be replaced.  Sure we will always get other friends –hopefully- but that friend who left our lives cannot ever be replaced.  Now again I am not talking about death or anything so dramatic, I only mean the sort of superficial, needless loss that exists when a friendship breaks-up or grows apart.  When a friend moves away, chances are you and she/he are going to grow apart.    Now I suppose it isn’t always so glum.  I have a friend, a girl I have known since the 7th grade and who moved away in the 10th grade.  We are still friends, now nearly 10 years since she moved.  We correspond, weather by the miracle of email or by what has come to be known as “snail-mail.”  We send on another pictures and such every so often.  So I suppose that its not all doom and gloom, but still she and I are no as close as we were in school, before she moved.    The Internet and “snail-mail” are fine and well but there lacks a sense of personal contact, again I shake my head and say; “Superficial loss.”    Now, there exists a world where it is no longer necessary for a person to leave their homes for friendship and companionship.  It is no longer necessary to go out and make friends, hell it’s hardly necessary to have any friends in flesh, so to speak.  Now we live in a world where anyone can have a friend for the $30.00 –I have a cable modem- a month everyone pays for the Internet.  To me this is a whole new sense of superficial loss.  It is the superficial loss of personal companionship.  How sad.  I suppose that I all of this talk has been brought about by the fact that a friend of mine –my best friend for the past 3 ½ years just moved away.  I suppose it was bound to happen some time, either that or I would have had to move, but I still feel the sense of loss for the whole situation.  I suppose its because I don’t make friends very easily and I like to hold onto the one’s I have, or perhaps it’s because she and I were close friends, we both moved to town about the same time and neither of us knew a single soul –save my husband.  It all just strikes me as very, very sad.  Yet it is a situation that could not be helped right now.  So hopefully she will move back, or I will go see her.  I am going to have to refuse to let this situation result in superficial loss.  ~Kristyn
