Editorial i was at the grocery store the other day and noticed that the girl in the checkout stand right before me only had diet shakes and diet bars for purchase. lemme tell you, this girl could have been no older than 13 years old. she still had braces and her body hadn't even gone through puberty! hm, when i was her age, i was too busy chanting "i must, i must, i must increase my bust!" gosh, times sure haven't changed much...girls feel the same internal and external pressures about their physical appearance today as they did yesterday, if not more so. i don't think this situation is going to change anytime soon, and i am disappointed by the slow rate at which society is responding.   so far, it seems that treating the subject of dieting as taboo has done nothing more than create a desperate legion of closet-eaters, bingers, and anorexics. why not be open with it and say, how can i help you so that you are correctly informed on how to eat healthy and still look as good as you want? unlike decades ago when the word "diet" was exclusively defined as not eating or using hazardous diet pills, i believe that in our day and age, with the plethora of medical research and time-tested guidelines, the word "diet" should be redefined to mean a consciousness of good dietary choices. this means that EVERYONE, fat, skinny, or average, ppl who want to live a long life, or just want to look good, should all be on a lifelong diet. of course not everyone is born with a body like jennifer garner. heck even jennifer garner wasn't born with a body like jennifer garner; the woman runs five miles every morning! it just boils down to making some informed decisions and being disciplined.  i get frustrated when ppl have really negative reactions to the word diet. and these are the same ppl that'll turn around and say, "O-M-G! looook at her buuuutt!!! it is, like, sooooooo big!" responses like these have kept weight issues in the closet for too long.  In order for ppl to learn that there are better ways to lose weight than to starve, binge, purge, and starve some more, we should try to establish a supportive community to spread the word, be open, and not treat it like taboo. that is the only way to redefine "diet" so that it becomes something positive and progressive.   back at the supermarket while i was checking out my groceries, the bag boy made a comment about how good the ben's looked but needed to lose another 30 lbs before digging in. even though he was not fat by any standards, i told him to try the zone diet by dr. barry sears b/c of its nutritional balance, but he said he was on weight watchers and had already lost 52 lbs. "GOOD FOR YOU!!! Keep it up!!" i shrieked. i tell ya, i was so happy for him i almost bagged my own groceries. based on his pleased but surprised look, i guess he usually doesn't get such an encouraging reaction, but i bet you he felt really good about himself that day.
