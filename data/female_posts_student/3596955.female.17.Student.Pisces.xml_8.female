I just want to *zzZz* in my *ooh comfy *awh bed.  Seven beautiful hours later.  hii my beautiful friends!  You guessed right! I got some much sought sleep!   Now I'm feeling *ahh but still *ergh for the fact that my assessment count is still seven *sigh. I want to *vtschh. Nope *vroom. Nope changed my mind. Im so *brrr. Riddle Diddle Time. *hurrah! The cow went *moo to the chicken. What did the chicken say? The chicken went *f-off + courtesy of bus bay babe ;) hehehe. Opps. *fluff? Oh *pooh. Im still so brrr. Opps *yawn. Oh! seven *squeals*  three *cheers* for sleep! ooh* brrr. Opps *yawn. Opps *achoo. Opps *god bless you!   During these *fab-5 hours of sleep, I had a dream. I was in a mall somewhere. Where you could not walk anywhere. By getting around to shop, you had to swim everywhere. I did not know what to wear. You had to swim with Fish. These fish were out of the extraordinary. Weird looking creatures. *puke. Meanwhile, my good friend Monica squashed a fish. I saved it. I jumped in  saved it! Mind you, this fish or so it seems, bore a similar resemblence with a tadpole. I developed a friendship with it. Two hours later it died. I ended, by exclaiming,  'One day we will meet again Nemo.'     -- missin' inseperable times --
