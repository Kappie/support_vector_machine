He's still really drugged up, he's still moving furniture and thinks that somehow a little fairy will flitter down and come and make him a rockstar.  (Good luck with that, idiot.)  Apparently within the last couple of days he has had a run-in with God.  This was such a big deal that he had to call me and tell me about it and how its a "sign" that we should get back together.  When he and I were dating our anniversary was 02.22.02.  Apparently Thursday night he was having a rough night, the drugs weren't being so kind to him and he was feeling like the failure he is.  He went to the ATM to withdrawl money, his balance was $22.02.  He went to the counter, bought his pack of Marlboro red's and headed home.  On his way home (and I recall all of this based on his telling it to me last night) he asked God to send him someone who would help him and a sign that he wasn't completely alone and doomed to fail.  He goes upstairs, smokes a joint and picks up his sister's cell phone.  He scrolls through her phone book and my name (and new cell # he didn't have) show up at #22.  According to my simple-minded ex, it was "fate" that "our numbers" kept popping up everywhere so he had to call me and try and get back together with me.  I have also been informed that if I deny that we should get back together that I am lying to myself.    Apparently he's unaware of the fact that a) he choked me and threatened to cut and burn me b) accused me of stealing 2 grand from him and c) cheated on me twice (once with his  ex with herpes  who he later found out he had gotten pregnant, but he swears they used protection).  Apparently now though, even though she's terminated her pregnancy, he realizes sex is no joke and "hasn't been with anyone since me", except for that girl who his sister told me he was sleeping with in the HALLWAY OF THEIR APARTMENT! (Classy!).  I told him to get bent and not call my house anymore.  Why is my life filled with retards?
