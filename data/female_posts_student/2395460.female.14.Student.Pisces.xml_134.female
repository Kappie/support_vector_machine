Tonight, I bought myself a  urlLink Pontiki , a one inch high Mr. Potato Head-like building toy. I'm sad because when I put him all together, he didn't look much different except I added the giant melanoma and the brow piercings. Some people actually got  urlLink pretty creative .  I got my Pontiki at a B.Dalton Bookstore, but I think they'll be every-freaking-where very soon.
