WE had an ALS revision session at noon in lect theatre one. Felt kinda funny being LT 1 again.. as zak had put it .. it felt kinda ' nostalgic'. Fourth year is all about NOT having lectures. Obviously a lot of pple had bothered to turn up for this session.. it being like i just said, a guaranteed-to-come-out station during next week's OSCEs.  argh the OSCE's. God knows what they shall give us this year.This morn zak and i practiced several examination techniques in the revision room in clinical skills ( aka the medic's play room ). The revision room has medic toys in it .. hahaha.. namely the plastic bum for rectal examination, the pregnant abdomen with the wee 38-week old baby in it..me and zak practiced examinations on each other. surprise surprise.. deaf belinda has got really nice intact tympanic membranes ( ear drums).   My exams are in .. hmm.. lets see.. exactly one week from today. Dear God, please help me pass ..
