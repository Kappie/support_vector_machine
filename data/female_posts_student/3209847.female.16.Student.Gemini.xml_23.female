Awards Ceremony: I got Outstanding Honors Chem, Outstanding Beginning Acting, and Outstanding Choir, woohoo! I was really excited. I didn't think I was going to get that many awards..  I had a GREAT day today all because of.. hmm, drum roll please...*drums roll* SARAH! She was up at school and I didn't get to see her! I was so mad at myself. But she came to my house and we got to be with each other for about an hour! I hadn't seen her since saturday and I won't see her again until wednesday. But we had a fun time at least! yay, that made my day so great.  Sunday, I basically was sick ALL day long. Throwing up, fever, eating crackers when i felt a little better, taking baths, i mean i haven't been that sick in a long long while. My mommy took care of me though. I felt like such a baby. I hated it, haha.  Sarah's addicted to this new fishy game. I have GOT to try that out!! Keep commenting on how you're doing on it. Sarah's really really good at it.   I had a really good day. I hope everyone else did. I miss you sarah. *kisses* only 4 more days and then we are out of here!
