They steal  his  trix right out of his hand, and they say "silly rabbit, trix are for kids", but after you rewrite this "code" it says "fucking rabbit, trix are for us so we can take over the world." Is this true? Yes, I would like to think so, and I think you should too. I think today, for me is going to be another one of those "waste my life" kind of days. I'll probably watch TV for half the day, then lie down on my bed and stare at the wall, and I'll eat all junk food. Ha. My kind of depressing, boring day. Well, I guess I could do something conventional and write a letter to Orlando Bloom, but that's the only good thing I'll be doing today other than writing in you, my precious journal. If I had a real journal, like the kind that you write in with a pencil, I'm sure I wouldn't write this much, because after a while your hand starts to hurt like hell. But typing usually doesn't do that to you, the only reason I said it hurt my hand in my first entry was so I would have an actual excuse to leave, without randomly signing off. I think that 8th grade is going to be sorta hard, because I remember my older brother, James, had to do like a million speeches. I HATE SPEECHES, they are boring and hard to do and nerve racking. Ugh. I've learned to hate school very much in the past few years. Do you know that I have wasted almost half my LIFE going to school? IT IS HORRIBLE.  HORRIBLE!    When school starts, that's when I will have been going to school for  9  whole years of my  13  year old life! That's including kindergarten. Speaking of school, my cousin Bella is going into kinderarten this school year. I think she'll do good. All they teach you in kindergarten is your ABC'S and 123's. And how to share and get along. It's pretty much preschool all over again. Right now Hannah isn't watching TV, because she isn't here right now, she is at Bella's house because she invited her over for a sleepover. Hannah is going into 6th grade this year, and the girl looks NOTHING like me, I have brown hair, and she has blond hair. I have hazel eyes, she has blue eyes. I have tanish skin, she has pale skin. Aren't siblings sopposed to look alike? What happened there? Hannah is the complete opposite of me. I think my mom must have cheated on my dad or something because no one in my family has blond hair. Plus we are a quarter guamanian, and they are really dark people, with tan skin and blackish hair, but yet again, Hannah is blond guamanian. I gotta go now because "my hands are starting to hurt". Gotta go now... shee yous.  -Sierra
