Should be though. :)   Tomorrow, I'm going to hang out with Kathryn (the other one, heh) then I'm going to Noodles for dinner with Carson. I've been craving some Noodles mac and cheese so...that's exciting. Yum. :) This weekend's going to be a bummer though. I'm working on Friday 6-10, Sat. 3-11 and Sunday, 6-11. Blahhh. :( There go my weekend nights.   Anyway, I have to get going. I hope everyone's enjoying their spring break. :)
