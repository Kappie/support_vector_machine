I have a midterm in my lab tomorrow... then I'm going to rush home, change, and then head over to Daughn Bayer's bridal shower... then hopefully I can spend some time with Melissa.  :-)  Sunday, I think I'm gonna try going to church.  Depends on if I can get myself up... which will depend entirely on how late I stay up with Melissa on Saturday night.  :-)  Domino effect, ya know?  What else is going on?  I have music theory homework out the wazoo..!!!  On the upside, it should be relatively easy, because I've been analyzing a lot of Mozart Piano Sonatas in class (and by default outside, since the stuff gets stuck in my head!).  I'm also working on my webpage for my computer class.  Once it's looking better and makes more sense, I'll link to it here.  I'll have it for the rest of the time that I'm at UTSA... and probably about 2-4 years after... although I won't be able to update it because I won't have access to the server... BUT... it'll still be around!  :-)  Okay... enough... I'm done rambling... ;)  FOR NOW!
