THAT IS SO UNFAIR! I've barely done anything! :P OK, so sue me, I didn't even touch my homework!! :P And now I'm stuck with a whole TON of it! I have a wood carving project, an art thingy, a history paper to complete and a plastic photoframe to piece together. AND I'm gonna be out tomorrow.  Talk about procrastinating, eh?  :P Oh well...I'm trying to finish off my history thing tonight and the art thingy. I'll work on the piecing together tomorrow. And the wood carving? I seriously don't know. :( Helpppppppppppppppppppppppp!!!!! --Fluffles--
