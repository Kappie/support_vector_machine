Then, after the game we all went to Ciros. It was really fun, I love our team. The people are just awesome. Around the end of dinner Melly and Greg Rosetto walked in and I talked to them for a bit, then we all went back to Stasi's house. I left very educated. Saturday at the race I ran pretty well it was a good time. I PRed for my 200 and my 300 time wasn't too bad. Finally the practice and chugging endless amounts of water is paying off.  Then the rest of this weekend has really just been chillin and sleeping. Not much studying which I should be doing. My room had just been declared a disaster area by the Messy Room Association of America. I'll clean it tomrrow. Got a whole latta laundry to do. Well.. I think that's about it. x0x
