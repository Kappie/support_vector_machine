I'm actually pretty proud of it, i wrote that thing, 30 pages worth! Go me!      Anyway i just had to post that. I'm in a kinda good mood, i was listening to something corporate... except my brother is 100% annoying. He bounced up to me all happy and said "Guess what we disected a rat today in science and it was SO funny!!"      he is SO dumb
