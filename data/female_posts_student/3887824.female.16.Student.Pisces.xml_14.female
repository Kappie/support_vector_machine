You strive to like everyone you meet, but sometimes they do not like you back. This one is different; Special. Worth it. There is a connection; Something. But what? Will you ever know? No. ...Maybe. Such is life,  you suppose. Please live to understand that you cannot always get what you want. But if something is meant to happen then it will happen. ...Right? We shall see; We shall. So, A connection? â€¦Perhaps.
