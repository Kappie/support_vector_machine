Florida was not.  just in clarification, it's actually my great aunt, and she's the one who came up to help my mother when walt was born.  My great uncle seems to be handling it well. but we really don't know because he really hasn't been alone since her death.   Additionally, my uncle decided he didn't need two cars, so we got his subaru impreza. here's a description separated for easy reading. Girls: Small green hatchback, 1997 model, working air conditioning, Guys: 2.2 liter V4, 230ish Hp, 4WD, 30,000 miles, effortless 90Mph, Power steering, ABS, Power windows/locks, Keyless entry, With pretty good off-road capabilities now that I think about it, none of you really cared about the guys portion, oh well  It feels good to be home again.
