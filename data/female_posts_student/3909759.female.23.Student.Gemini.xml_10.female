I'll just be sitting here playing music I like and rambling and stuttering on the mic.  It feels like I am doing a show and tell for no one.   And that seems to be the metaphor for life, here and there that feeling of staging a big foolish comedy for the eyes and ears of nobody.  Either way, when you hear these songs I probably picked them out on purpose.
