Also think about exactly what was said by who and see if it seems derogatory.  stop the arguing and think.  Rosie, don't think that josh and linds are teaming up on you because they dislike you.  they are defending someone you attacked, wether or not she attacked you first is immaterial, you attacked her.  think about the think you basically attacked Linds over Michael,  i defended Linds not because she needed my help or because "I like her more" (don't you  ever  qoute me on that), but because you attacked her personally.  by the way if any of you post any more angry posts over that next few days i'm going to bitch slap you to Kingdom Kong and back.
