That hamster is the only pet that she has had that died of old age. It was named Gizmo, or something. It was almost murdered several times when it was staying at my house. After Gizmo unfortunately died at the ripe old age of 2, she got this other hamster that was named Teddy, or something, that died after like a week. Then she got another one that I don't think stayed around longer than a couple of days because it was messed up and attacked people. Then she decided to forgo the whole hamster experience because they either died or freaked out and got a lizard. It was named... um... I can't remember, but I'm sure it was clever. This lizard was supposed to eat crickets, but then it wasn't hungry for a couple of days so she put like all of the crickets into the lizard tank thing and left it. Then she came home from school one day, or woke up one morning, one of the two, and went over to say hi to her little lizard, but it was basically a dried up piece of skin. What we think happened was, the crickets attacked it and ate its eyes out and then sucked it dry. Which to me, was very funny, but she was sad for some reason. Now she has a hermit crab which as far as I know is still alive. His name is James, affectionately named after this kid who we for some unknown reason (even to us) called Hermit all the time in the sixth grade.
