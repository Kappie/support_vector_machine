Me and a little girl annie were avoiding them the w hole day so it was cool. Then there was a storm with lots of lightning and thunder so i sat on my porch and watched it haha. Later .. like idk when but I picked up carissa and she was pissed because Matt screwed her over and went to Sopp's house with Trevor. So I called and pretended i didn't know what was going on and was like 'arent you going to the game with us?' He was like call sopp i gg. THen my mom brought me and carissa to Eckerdcause i had to get stuff forcamp/vaca. Trevor called and was like .. do you wanna do something, i'm here with sopp and macart. Maybe they were pretending to be stupid like i did before to them. But they ended up comming here. Trevor and sopp were on my comp fuckin around with it and i think they asked Kirsten something about thomas .. and she got pissed and then i was like 'omgg i'm sorry that was matt.' but it wasntbut he doesnt care. I made carissa almostspit milk all over because i was screaming something about Emu's .. yes the ugly birds. But idk it's in a song. She ended up spitting itin the toilet but it was really funny.      Steven and Robert left for proshot today haha . that's prettysweet cause me and john get along very well with out them. But they come back the day I leave for cadet camp. I dont really care tho.. i'm not gonna cry and be like wow ill miss you soo much. And i thought i had something else to say but .. i dont think so. Peace out =)       Beatles- Penny Lane  "In penny lane the barber shaves another customer, We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
