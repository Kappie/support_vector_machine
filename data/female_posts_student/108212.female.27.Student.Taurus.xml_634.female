Not that I was trying to get the highest score.  It just came as a surprise to me that I would score higher than Bill Gates.  Going back to the questions and clicking on the NO radio buttons on the latter questions, I received a lower score.  IPOD is Apple's product for an MP3 player.  For all you music enthusiasts, there are 3 IPOD versions introduced in Macworld. Depending on the version that you purchase you can save up to 4000 songs on the IPOD which is about the size of your average Palm Pilot.  Now Apple will be letting the whole world in on the IPOD.  One will be able to use it for a Windows Computer and download MP3 compressed music to the IPOD.    QuarkXpress is what professional typesetters, magazine artists,etc use for creating documents.    More to come...  (_)_)   Net
