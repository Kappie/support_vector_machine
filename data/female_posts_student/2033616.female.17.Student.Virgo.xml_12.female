It is located in a bright shopping center just off the beach and is the perfect spot for ice cream or gormet coffe, as well as a handy place to check your e-mail (it is easy to see why i visited so often).  The front of the store had little gifts and knick knacks for sale as well as some antiqued sofa's and chairs to accomidate the "gossipers" that happened to strole by.  I found the place very charming... and so i stole their name :-D thanks guys!  Well so far this weekend has consisted of fire (don't worry everything was under control), hair cuts, shower curtains, Chicago, curling iorns (used as a straightener), week wackers, and lots of Spanish.  If everything goes as planned i will have seen 5 people from camp(s) by wednesday.  Crad drove down to visit us on Sat, I sat w/ Becky in church today, and on tuesday if everything goes w/out a hitch, i'll get to see Aliesha Anne Jack and Bret.    Life is hard and people are even harder.  Ho hum to the people that are being stupid and three cheers for the people that are here.  I'm late it's tired.  Goodnight my someone.  signed, Un-frizzy Lizzie (for tonight anyway... and I'VE GOT PICTURES to prove it)
