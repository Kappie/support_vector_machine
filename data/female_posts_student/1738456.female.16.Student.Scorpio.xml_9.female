Rocky, with his blonde hair and tall frame. Rocky, who could make me smile with a wink. I could tell nothing I did was going to take my mind off him, and since nobody was home, I finally decided to go for a swim.  I got outside and found my neighbor, Jack, lounging around in his yard with friends. A couple of them were sitting in a circle passing a joint around, and a few more were trying to do keg stands. Some were sitting around a table containing a platter of categorically questionable brownies. Jack sauntered up to the fence and leaned over brushing his floppy brown hair out of his eyes. I liked to call them “stoner bangs.” He thought of himself as a heart breaker, and sometimes even hit on me, but because he was two years younger, it’s a bit hard to take him seriously.  “Hey babe, come hang with us,” he waved me over to the fence giving me the once over silently. I was glad I’d worn shorts over my bikini.  “Actually, I just came out to do a few laps because I can’t think,” I draped my towel over the edge of the fence, “Besides I’m not much of a party girl,” I nodded to the group passing the joint and started to walk away.  “Oh come on, at least have a beer, that’ll help you unwind,” he opened the gate.  “Okay, I guess I’ll stay for a lil bit,” I knew his mom was across the street, probably screwing around with her boyfriend. That’s why Jack and his sister, Cameron, did the stuff they did. Their mom had cheated on their dad when Jack was around ten, with their across-the-street neighbor. Cammie was somewhere in the yard either smoking or making out with her boyfriend no doubt. She was only thirteen. Which was only a year older than Jack was when he started. I worried about them both, but they didn’t listen to me.  “Sit down, and take a load off,” he handed me a red plastic cup filled to the brim, and walked over to the guys at the keg to tell them to cool it.  “Hey there,” a guy in dreads said from across the table. He was in my grade, so I wondered momentarily why he was hanging out over here. Until he offered me a brownie.  “Depends, is there anything in ‘em besides flour, milk, eggs, and sugar?”  “Yea, well, um, there’s chocolate too,” he said with a shrug and took one off the top.  “Yea, no thanks,” I sipped on my beer for a while inhaling the smoke around me. After a few minutes, I decided I had better get out of there before I somehow ended up in the circle. Besides, I still had that essay to write.  “Hey, wait,” Jack grabbed my arm.  “Yea?”  “Close your eyes and open your mouth,” he said sweetly. I knew better than to do that around here. I might end up OD-ing on acid or something.  “No way, not at this house,” I pulled his hand off my arm and walked away.  “Whoa, babe, check it out,” he opened his hand and showed me a valentine’s cookie, with a little red heart on top. I’d helped his sister bake a batch of them for her English class.  “I have a name you know.”  “Yea, whatever, you want it?” He held his hand out again, and I thought about it for a moment and vaguely remembered something about consequences for a certain Alice when she ate some unmarked cookies.  “Is there weed in it?” I asked incredulously.  “No,” he replied pushing his hand forward.  “Okay, night Jack,” I went through the gate, and got ready to swim.
