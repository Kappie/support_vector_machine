In other news, terrorists invaded Antigua today and I had to ask for directions, but the ticket only cost a pound so that's all right, provided the Loch Ness monster doesn't knock me into the water.  In other news, I have finished work experience. It was a very boring week. I now have to write a log about it. Lame. Maybe I'll go completely over the top and include pictures and all sorts. Just so the  fat cats  have to read through all of it. That'll learn them for making me do stuff I don't want to do.. On seconds thoughts, that's far too much effort, even if it would teach them a thing or two about  respect .  In other news, I hope this DofE expedition Rob and I are going on is cancelled. I don't want to go. I'm forced to borrow Penmo's bag because my brother has mine and he is in some place.. Antigua or Fiji or something.  In other news, I should stop doing this.  Yes. So I'm still trying to figure out the easiest way to edit the blog's appearance without putting in immense amounts of effort. I should probably update  urlLink my website  too.  I think I'll listen to Livin' La Vida Loca again. It makes me laugh. Whoooooosh.  Loooooooooong post. I like these. It makes me feel superior to inferior Rob, who posts little short ones every day.  QUALITY NOT QUANTITY.  Yeah. Word up, yo yo yo. Ok. So that last bit was a load of rubbish and, indeed, so is this. But I don't care. I have written a nice long post.
