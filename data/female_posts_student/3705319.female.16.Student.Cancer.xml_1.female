Big brother decided to play a trick on the housemates by making the showers unnescesarily(sp?) cold!!!!  The team left on time(at last) at 11:30 heading for the Churches Choir festival. The team arrived but the choirs didnt until 2 hours later. Once the festivities began the team joined in the dancing and attmpted to "sing". All hopes of sounding good were dashed when the choirs split off into millions of harmonies(quote from Rachel). The team departed at 5, after 2 and a half hours of the part-ay!  Team Dassie "Cooked like demons" and made enough sweet and sour stir fry to "feed the hostel 3 times over"(courtesy of Rachel yet again)  All the housemates remain in good spirits and await the arrival of the new housemate Katy P(a.k.a "The Originator!")  *Big brother theme tune*  Credits: Team hedgehog (weeee....splat splat splat) Sues, Rachel and Phil  Prayer Points: *Katy P's travel, safe arrival and the strength to make it through the Church service. *That the food tomorrow at the Church will accomodate all needs(shall we say as most of you know the state of some members health!) *Strength for the week ahead and as we prepare for the tasks set for us. *That God will put upon each of our hearts the place that we should be during the next week(ie. the school or the HIV orphanage) *Anything else you consider relevant(oh and that the weather will get a tad warmer and less cold as we are all getting quite cold!)
