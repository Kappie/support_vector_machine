Would not mind dating the kid he seams real sweet! I don't know if Zach is comming up for Old Home Days evey time I talk to him the answer changes. Someone called me today and told me we have to march Saturday. Ha, they can all go and kiss my ass I don't give a damn. If they wanted us to march we should of at least had a weeks notice. Plus, my Aunt Ellie is comming in this weekend. She lives in Wyomie. As far as I am concerned I am not marching and if I get in trouble for it I will just quit. I don't even fucking care if I go to disney or not! Ugghhh!!! If you can't tell MArching Band stresses me out. Oh, thinking of that I will probley have to go get my medicine again b/c of all the fucking stress. MY GOD, what am I going to do?O. yeah I remember I am not going to be in it my Jr. and Sr. years. Its a waste of my time! Now that I have said all that. Have a nice day!
