CYCL conference that had not yet seen Michael Moore's film Fahrenheit 9/11... so I downloaded a bootleg copy and watched it on my computer.  I found the documentary to be very touching and effective.  It's clear that he stretches the truth in places to make his points, but every good documentary has to take a point of view.  He said nothing surprising about Bush... I've been thoroughly disgusted with him for some time now. The interviews with the parents of soldiers in Iraq were very moving, as was the footage of the low-income citizens about enlisting.  It was good to see the 2000 election footage.  Unfortunately I didn't follow current events four years ago... I was only in 7th grade.  Looking back at the outcry that followed the Supreme Court ruling is shocking.  I had no idea that there were  riots  at his inauguration parade.  Where was I?  Uninformed people, as I used to be, might as well be dead.  My favorite part was the George Orwell quotes at the end.  I recently read Orwell's two most famous books and I'm pretty sure this quote from the F911 is composed from snippets of 1984: It's not a matter of whether the war is not real... or if it is.  Victory is not possible.  The war is not meant to be won; it is meant to be continuous.  A hierarchical society is only possible on the basis of poverty and ignorance.  This new version is the past, and no different past can ever have existed.  In principle, the war effort is designed to keep society on the brink of starvation.  The war is raged by the ruling group against its own subjects, and it's object is not the victory over Eurasia or East Asia but to keep the very structure of society... intact.
