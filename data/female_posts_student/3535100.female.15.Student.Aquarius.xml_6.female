I said right, and abide my time  Spent my life looking for that somebody to make me feel like new Now you tell me that you want to leave me But darling, I just can't let you  [guitar  fiddle solo]  Baby, baby, when first we met I knew in this heart of mine That you were someone I couldn't forget. I said right, and abide my time  Spent my life looking for that somebody to make me feel like new Now you tell me that you want to leave me But darling, I just can't let you  Now that I found you I built my world around you  I need you so, baby even though You don't need me now  Baby, now that I've found you I won't let you go I built my world around you I need you so Baby even though You don't need me You don't need me no, no   "When you say nothing at all"  It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart Without saying a word you can light up the dark Try as I may I could never explain What I hear when you don't say a thing  The smile on your face lets me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall You say it best when you say nothing at all  All day long I can hear people talking out loud But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd Old Mr. Webster could never define What's being said between your heart and mine  The smile on your face lets me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall You say it best when you say nothing at all  The smile on your face lets me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall You say it best when you say nothing at all.   "Looking In The Eyes Of Love"  I wonder should I tell you `bout all the crazy things I've ever done I've been searching all my life And when I should have stayed I tried to run I was searching for an answer In a world full of strangers But what I found was never real enough Now that I've found you I'm looking in the eyes of love  Darlin' you've been good to me You are so much more than I deserve I never thought that I would find Someone who's so sweet and kind like you Please believe me when I say This time I won't run away I swear by all of heaven's stars above Now that I've found you I'm looking in the eyes of love  [Chorus:] Looking in the eyes of love I can see forever I can see you and me walking in this old world together Lord my heart's found a home I've been dreaming of Now that I've found you I'm looking in the eyes of love  [Chorus]   "I'll Be"  The strands in your eyes that color them wonderful Stop me and steal my breath Emeralds from mountains thrust toward the sky Never revealing their depth Tell me that we belong together Dress it up with the trappings of love I'll be captivated I'll hang from your lips Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above  [Chorus:] I'll be your crying shoulder I'll be love suicide I'll be better when I'm older I'll be the greatest fan of your life  Rain falls angry on the tin roof As we lie awake in my bed You're my survival, you're my living proof My love is alive not dead Tell me that we belong together Dress it up with the trappings of love I'll be captivated I'll hang from your lips Instead of the gallows of heartache, that hang from above  [Repeat Chorus]  I've been dropped out, burned up, fought my way back from the dead Tuned in, turned on, Remembered the things that you said  [Repeat Chorus]
