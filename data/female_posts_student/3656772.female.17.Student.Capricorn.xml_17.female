Today I had a terrible day, everything seemed to just be shitty in general, and yet...at the end I seemed to pull it around. One of the hardest things today, for some reason, it was as if I let my guard down and all the hurt I felt about the Colin event tried to drown me. I just kept being reminded of how much I was sad that we broke up, that we weren't friends anymore, how we didn't talk, how I felt like an outsider, how much I didn't want that to be like that, and how helpless I felt to fix it....on top of it all, I had a chem. test, I need to redo half of my Bryce project...which I swear hates me, it keeps getting deleated for random reasons.....God, and I just plain _woke up_ feeling low as Hell. *shrugs* But  today, well...after school, I was riding on the bus with Smauss, and I knew she was tired and was worrying about her own problems, and was just listening to me fume about how I was feeling....but even so, her listening was the best thing she could have done for me. She let me rant and I eventually ran out of steam, and we sat quietly for a while...and I just thought. I thought for a while...and just before my stop, I decide I'm not going to allow him to do this to me..to make me so unhappy. It's _not_ okay, and I _won't_ be sad because of the Colin thing. I refuse to.          And this is how you remind me        This is how you remind me        Of what I really am  That's for Smauss and Colin both. Smauss in a good way, and Colin in a bad-ish way. Smauss reminded me though her support and confidence in me who I am inside, and how I always fight it when people control me like that. Colin reminded me through just plain making me feel like shit, that I won't take that from him, and, more importantly, I won't allow myself to feel like that.
