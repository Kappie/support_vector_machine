Provides freedom Enjoy life without embarrassment!" and  "Flatulence/Gas Deodorizer End embarrassment with Dr.'s choice charcoal filter pads for smelly gas"  were found at the top of some random guys blog who likes eminem who because of this is even worth linking. But the ads are the most hilarious thing I've seen in a long time. I wonder what kind of crazy ads are at the top of my blog.
