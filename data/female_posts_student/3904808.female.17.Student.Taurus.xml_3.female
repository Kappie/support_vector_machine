After halfway eating the harsh brown, it suddenly flew out of my hands and landed on the floor... sigh... my harsh brown!! sigh............. oh no... den peiling told me that i was only acting to be sad of the harshbrown... she was right actually... i was running away, i guess... i did not wanna think about anything else...   den i got up the bus to go home and found i had no fare left... den i checked my coins and still, no coins... i remembered that my friend once told me to pretend when you had no money on the bus. so iwent to the back discreetly and stood there silently untili got down at my stop...  at home, i thought about what peiling told me, i was running away.... but from what? Den i thought deeply about it. I was runningfrom thate guy...she was so right... i do not wanna think about anything else anymore... i just wanna get through jc and get on with life. ioso going to a friend's birthday liao today... hahaxx...
