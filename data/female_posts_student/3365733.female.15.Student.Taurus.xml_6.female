I hope the teachers round up and then I'd have an A1. The paper is so friggin' hard, I tell you. Something about Penan and tribes and stuff. =) Ms Leong stamped a "Top Effort" on the paper. I can safely say my paper was the only one she did that for. Hah.   (A1. Hopefully.)    E. Literature:  73.9%. Not too bad, and the teachers were quite pleased, so I think it's okay? I could've pushed for a A1, though. =) My literature is ranked #1 in my class. Teehee.  (A2.)    Higher Chinese:  71.5%. Yuck yuck yuck. Although I don't like the subject... =) It's an okay result. Felt that I could've done better though. If my composition had been written a bit better. Or rather, if I had more time to write more for the argumentative essay. =)  (A2.)    E. Maths:  83.5%. Whahahahhaha. The only girl who got a distinction + Ranked #3 in class. Not too bad. =)  (A1.)    A. Maths:  73%. Not too good. But more than 3/4 of the girls in class failed, and I still managed to get a distinction.  (A2.)     Combined Humanities:   History  --> 69.5% for the history paper; and blame it all on the source-based questions. =) My structured essay was only deducted of 4 marks out of 25 so I'm happy! =)   Social Studies  --> 92%. I am  so proud  of this paper. Ms Ng rocks. =D I was deducted marks from my SBQs(again!) and I got full marks for the SEQs. =D  (Combined Humanities rawscore: 80.75%)  (A1.)    Physics:  72%. Ehhhh. =(  (A2.)    Chemistry:  (Ms Wassan is a terrible setter of a paper) 66%. HORRORS! But hey, more than half of the level failed. Haha. =P  Edited to Add:  WOOTS! 5 more marks for moderation. Which means Chemistry = 71 = A2!  ( B3 A2.)   So that makes my L1R5... Wait lemme count. =D  9 8! I want to aim for a perfect 6 pointer, though. =( And after deduction of higher chinese and CCA points (I'm already way above 10 ;)) It'll be 5 points. Think that'll be good enough to enter NJC? =)  PS: I  did  cry during Troy. =(
