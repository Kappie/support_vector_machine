I've only been here for five days, but it seems like I've been here for a long time already. I miss my house. And my room. And how I could stay online all day. XD But here I have to use it late at night. It's funny tho. This vacation feels like it's trying to pry me away from my online persona, but here I am, clinging to dear life. Lol!  All we've been doing lately is going to different malls (which are really big and nearly deserted, compared to the Philippines at least) and ending up not buying anything. =S But I've already gotten some stuff. I got new shoes, a manga (Zodiac PI... it was an impulse buy), and a frog lamp... I also got a jr bow and arrow set. XD But along with my new stuff, these horrible little sores developed around my lips... >  The weather has cleared up since my last post. My last post it was raining and the wind was blowing in all directions.. but now it's sunny; you only need a light jacket. Well, I need a light jacket at least.  Lots of our plans have changed. I don't think we're going to Canada anymore; the uncle we were supposed to stay with is going to the Holy Land and to a tour of Europe for his wedding anniversary. The uncle we're staying with now is having his wedding aniv. this week, and we plan to go to Atlantic City! O_o  Another one of our plans have changed also. I might not go to college in the US afterall.
