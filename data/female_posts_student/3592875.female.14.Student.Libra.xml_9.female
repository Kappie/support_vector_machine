I think I think to much.  Trey IMed me at like 1:00 this morning, it was the most interesting conversation, well not that interesting, I just haven't talked to him since January? hmm..   People change, things happen,you make new friends and lose some old ones, life goes on.   ???am I right???  I hate thinking about the past, the present is rather boring and the future looks....Well it's a mystery now isn't it?  nothing more to say, just random thoughts are going through my mind I can't seem to put anything together right now.
