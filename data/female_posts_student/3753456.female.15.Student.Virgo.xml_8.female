I squat on the shower floor Crouching in the feotal position Grounding myself to the earth’s surface With the element of water cascading over me. I summon the power from beneath me And it pumps through my body Bringing me to life Making me alive and well.  I can feel the spiders crawling on my back Their legs journeying up my spine Tingling each individual vertebrae With their condemned presence. Once you feel those pinpricks You know it’s the end I know I am going to die now But that’s a relief to me.   I’m on the journey to hell The endeavor everyone takes If you let go of the rope That’s leading you there Then you go to heaven So I’m holding on tight Holding on for dear life Or dear death as it should be.  Can you hear the bells of hell? They’re calling Beckoning me forward With their reaper-style toll. I’m nearly there now I can feel it in my veins The happiness of hell spreads  Branching into my bones.  The sky bleeds here Blood as red as wine Falls from the stratosphere Flooding the plains. No one goes thirsty No one goes unbathed The abundance of satanic downfall Aids us all.   Hell is a place for the damned The only habitat they can truthfully call home It’s where we can fit in And know how everyone else feels. Ther eis no minority here No one labeled as ‘freak’ The earth’s stereotype of hell as bad is wrong Because all here are happy.   wasn't that lovely!
