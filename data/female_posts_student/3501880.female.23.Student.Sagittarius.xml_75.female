This is completely against my nature, because I have been trained since birth to show up places approximately 15 minutes early.   My disposition for earliness is my mother's doing. I used to HATE that at friend's sleepovers she was ALWAYS the first mother to collect their child. Not only did I hate being ripped prematurely away from the festivities, but I also could not shake the overwhelming fear that as soon as I left, all my friends would gossip about me.  My dad always countered this by being 15 minutes or more late. A few times when I asked him to pick me up from work, he averaged about 30 minutes behind schedule. His excuse? I was cleaning the fridge, I had to wash my glasses. It didn't matter, I was still pissed that I had to spend the better part of an hour sitting on the curb outside my office building like an abandoned child, informing my co-workers as they passed by, "No, really...my ride should be here any minute."  It was always interesting when the time wars ensued between my mother and father. If we need to be somewhere, my mother would round all of us kids up and shout to my father, "It's time to go!". We would make our way down to the car, and sit there, hoping to compel my father from the house. But it never worked. Instead, he would come down, only after we had honked the horn a few times and were sufficiently pissed off, and simply say, "What were you guys doing in the car so early?"  As a result, I tended to follow my mother's example, but instead just merely tried to arrive on time, neither too early or too late. But lately, I can't seem to be anywhere on time. And strangely, there is no explanation for why I am late. My brain no longer processes the concept of being on time.  For example, here is a usual morning routine: I get up late, leaving myself only about a half hour to get ready and drive to school. After a quick shower and getting dressed, somehow my brain thinks it is a good idea to check my email with only 15 minutes before class and my hair still soaking wet. Not just a quick check, but rather carefully reading each email, including junk mail.   This just confirms that I am slowly turning into my father with each passing year.
