Well apparently, I cut him off 3 times when he wanted to talk abt some warcraft stuff to me. I only felt I distrupted the communication flow when a fren called me on my other fone telling me abt the mortal hat for my convo next thursday.   Maybe I was too tired. Or maybe I was plain brain dead. I really can't remember when I cut him off when he was talking except for the fone call distruption. Initially I felt terribly annoyed and it irk me further when he was so formal and cordial on his msn; telling me that I should be more sensitive. But I curb my temper and try to recall what I had done. Perhaps I was really too mentally drained and wasnt concentrating. So I apologized to him and say I will attempt to be more sensitive now. I was sincerely apologetic abt it told him I AM interested to know what he wans to say. But he was pretty curt by saying:" nvm, tell u next time. I'm tired and gg to zzzz now" and he went offline. Seriously, with that I felt totally rejected... especially when I was really humbling myself and seriously attempting to remedy the situation. Oh well... Perhaps he was feeling that rejection too( I'm trying to be more sensitive instead of being reproachful if u can tell) esp when I supposedly cut him off when he was enthusiastically conveying his daily events.  Honestly, some part of me resents this particular behaviour of his. But I asked myself if it was justifiable for him to react this way. Sure he has his temper and I really do give him credit for such a drastic improvement over the past yr when we are together. No longer does he get so short and hot tempered, MCP, demanding and possesive. I really do appreciate it. Then perhaps it boils down to myself? Wat is it in me that is causing myself this negativity and such mind bogging insomniac phase?    Somehow I felt that I'm probing into some depths of myself that I probably wun like myself to find out. Yet it so paramount for me to continue digging the old ghosts and layers of shit ard my soul.
