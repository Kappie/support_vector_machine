Plus I had an optional skills practice I went to this morning for 2 hours. Yesterday morning was fun, when we went out to pepper and warm up the sprinklers went on while a couple of us were outside on the grass and we were running through them and stuff, i love water (speakin of which it's pouring right now) and then we had to go down to the other field to run sprints and when u win a sprint u get to sit down and i was one of the first people to win, i was so happy, but i don't like sitting in the middle of practice so i did lunges and stomach stuff instead. Last night at pracice i was so tired though, i played really bad and was pretty much dead on the court and when i got home i got some ice cream and layed on the couch and didn't move. The only really bad part is that my friend was basically told she didn't have a spot on the team :( which i was really disappointed about and so were a lot of people cuz she's been on our team for the whole year during club and we've spent a lot of time with her. But now I have a break until monday morning, yay. Time to watch some movies, and rest!   My mom just watched "The Butterfly Effect" which is a very good movie (i've seen it before) but depressing and not something i want to watch over again, but it's definetly the type of movie my mom likes. Now I think we're gonna watch "Starsky and Hutch"... last time i watched it and kept falling asleep and waking up cuz i was so tired and i didn't get to see much of it.   Anyways it's all rainy outside today so it's a good day to relax. Only 2 weeks till school starts :(   I'm gonna watch the movie and go online to do more research on my year in europe..lol! GOD BLESS
