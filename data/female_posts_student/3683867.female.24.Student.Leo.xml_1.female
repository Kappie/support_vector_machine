Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove: O no! it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark, Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.   Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's compass come: Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, But bears it out even to the edge of doom. If this be error and upon me proved, I never writ, nor no man ever loved. (Sonnet 116)    Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind, And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind. (A Midsummer Night's Dream, 1.1.231-2)    She never told her love,  But let concealment, like a worm i'th' bud, Feed on her damask cheek. She pined in thought,  And with a green and yellow melancholy  She sat like Patience on a monument,  Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed? (Twelfth Night, 2.4.115-120)     I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride, Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide. Do not extort thy reasons from this clause, For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause But rather reason thus with reason fetter, Love sought is good, but given unsought better. ("Twelfth Night", 3.1.151-6)     Love comforteth like sunshine after rain... Love's gentle spring doth always fresh remain. ("Venus and Adonis")
