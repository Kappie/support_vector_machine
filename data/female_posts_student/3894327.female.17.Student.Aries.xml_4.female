I suppose that I should go to sleep, sleep is a failsafe way to cure this kind of tiredness after all. But I won't. I don't want to sleep right now for several reasons, one, I am tired not sleepy, two, due to my college search when I sleep I dream about school, which is unpleasant under any circumstances.   I find that the best sleep comes when you have nothing on your mind. My scientific explanation for this is that it lets your brain rest better, very technical terminology I know, but try and roll with it.   Huh, I completely ran out of things to babble, prattle, write, think, about. Maybe I should try to sleep.     So..........The End   -Driel
