So yea i went on the computar for a bit...no one was on really, so i went to bed. Yup that was my amazing night lol wandering the streets is my kinda fun! Well then onto today! I've pretty much done nothing, I fought with my bro's for a while, stupid idiots someone take them away before i kill them! Sheesh, well then i decided i would leave them be and go outside to tan, was outside for about 2 hours, I sure am gettin black! sweetness, but now it looks like it just might rain like it was suppose to. Da maj just called, got some bad news, My aunt is suppose to have the baby anytime now went in for her check up thingy today, ends up with drastically high blood pressure, has to go back in 2 hours to check blood pressure again, if its still haigh she has to go into the hospital for emergency ceasection or however u spell it. She's not too happy, she wanted to have the baby at home...its these damn boys, its her third, hopefully the forth will be the lucky girl. Oh and lucky me i have to work tonight so i have to go 5 hours with no news about this new baby benjamin [thats what there naming it] Jacob, Issac and Benjamin isn't that cute!:)      My own written quotes for the day:      **I want this so bad, I can't give up on it**   **Do I give up now before I hurt even more**   **My heart is locked up and only you have the key. Help me find a way to open it and let it free**
