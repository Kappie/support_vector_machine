(repeat)  Don't ask no questions, it goes on without you Leaving you behind if you can't stand the pace The world keeps on spinning You can't stop it, if you try to This time it's danger staring you in the face oh oh oh  Remember (repeat)  My oh my heh, hey (repea, fade)   i dunno... "love will save the day" thats nice... you think it will? hmmm...  you know what else?  Somewhere over the rainbow Way up high, There's a land that I heard of Once in a lullaby.  Somewhere over the rainbow Skies are blue, And the dreams that you dare to dream Really do come true.  Someday I'll wish upon a star And wake up where the clouds are far Behind me. Where troubles melt like lemon drops Away above the chimney tops That's where you'll find me.  Somewhere over the rainbow Bluebirds fly. Birds fly over the rainbow. Why then, oh why can't I?  If happy little bluebirds fly Beyond the rainbow Why, oh why can't I?    escapism! im gonna go live over the rainbow!  ooooooh, nvm, emilys online! woot!
