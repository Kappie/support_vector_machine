There were a few ups and downs, mainly because one person was there who we really did not want there and of course she wouldn't get the hit that she wasn't invited and should just go home and leave, of course all the guys did not want her to leave, then they wouldn't have anyone to drool over.      Anyways, we got there a little after 8 and Angela and Steve were just finishing up making dinner so they could eat. Since it was raining a lot that afternoon we thought we might have to have everyone inside but we wnded up being able to stay outside. First it was just Angela, Steve, Stacey, Lester, Travis, Jessie, Traci and I. Then Rodney, Phil and Rick showed up. And then a little later Angie, Rodney, and Todd showed up. So that was all who was there.      Kimo was drinking his beloved Long Island Iced Tea and I knew he had too much when he started to get emotional so I was able to get him to go inside and lay down and he ended up throwing up and passing out a little while after being inside. That was at about 12. So the night was still young.      I had about 5/6 drinks in all, almost topped off a bottle of the new Parrot Bay - Mango with pineapple juice but it was good. I was being good since I knew I was going to have to drive so it kind of sucked with that part, but hey, I was being responsible hehe.       Some of them went swimming in the pool. The water was so warm but I never did make it in there. I can't believe that Jessie went in but she did. She wanted me to go in but I never did make it in there :(. I would of if I had some towels cause once you got out it was freezing. I think it was Jessie, Kimo, Lester, Travis and Rodney who went willingly, Steve and Rick who fell in with clothes and all on. Poor guys, it was freezing out.      All and all I had a great night over there after we were able tog et Kimo a little settled since he was being kind of loud. He can bug me sometimes by the way he acts and talks so thats why.       When we were leaving Rodney said that he was going to come over in about an hour. I was like ok, and he ended up coming over. We got home a little after 3 and he was there a little after 4 I think. He ended up staying until 5:30. Mikayla woke up as he was leaving and I was like, you need to go back to bed, its still early out. We just stayed up talking, after he was done looking at all of the Playboys that we have since there were some he hadn't seen.       Well I think this is a good blog and I will write more later. I am gonna call and see if Angela and Steve are up yet since it is a little after 11 and OH YEAH no one won Powerball. Damn I wanna win it. That would be great.
