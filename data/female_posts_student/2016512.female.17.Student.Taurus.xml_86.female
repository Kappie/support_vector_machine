ACTs are done and i didn't do very well but that's okay. i had a relaxing night at home on saturday and saw a bit of Emperor's New Groove. i've decided that ENG is my favorite Disney movie and i will be in pursuit of a not-so-expensive dvd. other news, i didn't want to kill anyone at dance. yay for no bad vibes! umm, me and al ducked out early to go to a prom meeting. we walked, which is something i intend to do more of. screw vehicle transportation the sun calls my name! prom meeting went fine. my job is pretty much done. yay! now all we have to do is get vases and decorate on "The Friday."  darian and i picked out flowers yesterday. it only cost us $19.98. woot! yay for sales. ummm, also my mom is going to make me a garder so i no longer have to spend money on one. (another plus) and also i don't think i will be having any jewelry because i'll have a corsage and my neckline is beaded. so prom prep is all done accept for hair clips and the actual meal.   in other news, i guess there's another pippin problem. hehe. i'm pretty sure the play is cursed. also, since miss speech is going to state (yay!) we will be having a sunday afternoon performance...noooo! so now i can't go to my piano recital. and i was actually looking forward to this one. *sigh* oh well i'm anticipating another problem...*devious plotting*  Twelve going on spinster, -Betso
