I have been reading awesome things about Gmail for the last couple of days and I have been worn down to the point where I want an account.  The problem you ask?  Gmail is still in testing phase and is not open to the general public.  Well then why adverise so highly?  Why have every single tech website tell you how amazing Gmail is and then it's not available to you when you want one.  I WANT ONE NOW!  I feel like that spoiled little bitch that was on Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory... the one who went down as a bad egg :)  I want a golden goose that lays chocolate eggs!  Actually... I settle for a simple Gmail account...
