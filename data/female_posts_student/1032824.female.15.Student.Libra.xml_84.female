"heart-poundingly"? what was i thinking? and also when i think sober, i talked a lot, to a lot of people and now i 'kinda' regret it.  The regret that makes u go "i ain't drinking and talking after it no more!"   Did you guys watch the  urlLink rugby world cup  match last night when England played against Wales? friggin' awesome wasn't it!?  prince Harry  was present too... * awwwwsh *
