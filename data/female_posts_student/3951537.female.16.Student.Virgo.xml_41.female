I am, typically speaking, too tired to dream at all, which is nice. I am realizing that now. I don't have normal dreams. I dream about people dying. I dream about falling. I dream about crawling around in underpasses with knives. The dreams where I almost die don't bother me at all. That's the creepy part. You'd think it would. I just don't care. This evening it started raining. No, pouring. There was so much water. Then tonight, around 10 o' clock, when we left, it was foggy. There weren't any cars around or anything. It felt so surreal and now I'm kinda sick and drifting. I'm starting to wonder if I'm still dreaming. You know, you never know. It's kinda weird, but I felt like we were going to hit something tonight. We didn't. Life's a weird place these days. People are getting shot out on the highway, and the rest of us just don't care. We just stay safe in our homes. Well, we're lucky. What about the people who don't have that kind of oblivious lazy happy security. We are so fucking selfish. So long as we're not in any sort of danger, it doesn't matter what happens to the rest of the world. Oh, well. People are getting shot every day. People are dying of sickness every day. All right, done with the righteous rant. I can't sleep these days. My mind won't shut down. It's not that I'm really preoccupied or anything, it's just that I can't get my mind to go to sleep. This brings me to my next point, in a convoluted way I really don't feel like explaining because it would take us into the depths of conversation too complicated for me to take the time to elaborate upon. I made the mistake of saying the phrase "I'll be gone in a year anyway" to my mom. bad plan. The point of this is that it's never a good plan to say that. Ever. It's been a weird night. I think it would be best if I just go sleep.
