After my nap I ate dinner..and then when to my driving lesson. The most interesting part of my day was my driving lesson. This is my 4th lesson with Mr. Deardorff (I think that's how you spell his name..he's a math teacher at MASH..and he sounds like Kermit the Frog..haha..Drew). So anyways back to the subject at hand..My first three lessons were pretty stupid because I basically drove around Saegertown, Guys Mills (why? I don't know), and Cambridge Springs, as well as Meadville. Well..this lesson I drove North I-79! When Mr. D...told me that I was "Dear God..help us all!"..because I've only drove the backroads of Crawford County and not the highway! I said a quick prayer and I merge on the highway (with no problems thank God..but it was hard!), and drove at 65 mph!! It was nuts!! But I survived..and I am able to type this in one piece! I have another lesson tommorrow..and I'm scared that we'll take another trip on great I-79! Anyways..that's all I have to say for now..later
