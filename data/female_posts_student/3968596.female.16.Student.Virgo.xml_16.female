Now, I tried  very  hard to restrain myself since the essay was due in three hours. I'm required to turn it in to Ms. Cutler at the front office...why she can't wait until school starts I dunno. Anywayz, I freaked out! B/c no matter what I did the printer was set in photo mode. I was thinking of these possibilities of how exactly I could get it printed---go to the library, Mailbox Etc., waking up neighbors at this ungodly hour (at least it is when it's still summer break)... Then I restarted the computer and the printer miraculously started working... ^_^6  Silly me, that always works.
