I remembered being totally obsessed with this really cool guitar... the ICEMAN GUITAR and the RANDY RHOADS RR1T! Oh my gosh! Total sexyness! Fuck, I want them! Dream guitars of mine... pics below.   Iceman IC400      Randy Rhoads RR1T     Oh my gosh... The Randy Rhoads RR1T might look crappy in that pic but in my magazine it is sooo fuckin sexy! Same with the Iceman guitar. Having either one of those will be like... dammmnnn...! Too bad, they cost thousands. My parents will never get 'em for me. :( I'll have to save up bit by bit. If I really want one, then it'd take me a few years of not going out or anywhere or spending ANY money whatsoever. :( *sighzZ* My only hope is this summer. MIGHT get electric guitar in the summer... MAYBE. I said I'd even give up getting a new bike if I get a guitar. I'd give up a new bike, new rollerblades, new hockey sticks, new PS, new computer, new anything! I just want an electric guitar! ...a BLACK one!... I like the Fender Stratocaster! It's nice! I like the Iceman more though, haha~! Oh my gosh... I really wannit sooo bad~~~! >O  Blah... enough day dreaming... I'm eyeing the Schecter Diamond Series SpitFire-6 right now! Damn, nice guitars! I want them sooo bad. >O
