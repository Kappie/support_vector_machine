Oh yeah the Internal Revenue Service sucks and they know it. I spent all day trying to prepare my un-organized and irresponsible father's tax return. I was interrupted by some drunk people trying to get on the roof of the building next door to watch the fireworks. Happy 4th to me. I haven't even touched any of my spanish homework yet, and I'm beginning to think that I won't until wednesday morning. It's been hard to concentrate because we hired some people to rip out the back patio and put in a new one. They haven't yet failed to wake me up every morning at exactly 7 a.m. So not only am I sleep deprived, I'm also incapable of concentration. I think over the next couple of days I am going to start working on my college essays or at least the topics for the commonap. I am freaked just thinking about it, but maybe if i start now, they will turn out fine. Why do they pick the worst topics?!? Like "Describe the most important even in your life" they might as well ask me to name my favorite song! And I still have summer reading to do! Which is so stupid. These are the books I have to read: Cat's Cradle, Into Thin Air, and Things Fall Apart. Oh the joys of attending a public school. I skipped out on my senior picture. I've got plenty of other things to concern myself with other than worrying about horrible yearbook picture. They'll probably figure it out though and track me down.   Things I would recommend:  The 'Franz Ferdinand' CD - it's one of those cd's where every song is good. Seeing the movie 'Dodgeball' - guys seem to really like. Eh it has it's moments.  Eating a gyro - OMG! They are so good.   Yeah, that's all I got.
