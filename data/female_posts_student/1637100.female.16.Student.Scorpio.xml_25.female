TUESDAY: unpacked from camping and basically did nothing  WEDNESDAY: did nothing again =(  THURSDAY: went to shans house to pick our song for special music and we tried to practice but robert wasnt there so derrick played for us but too high and derrick was trying to bring it down a key but it was difficult.. went to vancity and i slept over at her house too.. we watched maid in manhattan.. good movie! *thumbs up*  FRIDAY: woke up around 11 and watched bad boys (the first one) it was REALLY good!!! so suspenseful and funny too.. went to burnaby and vancity again to drop off shans aunt and then stopped by guildford for a bit to pick up sum stuff.. and then went back to the soongs house where me n shan washed derricks car, daniels car and their van.. it was fun i guess.. lol.. then we went downstairs n played sum good ol' nintendo!! DOUBLE DRAGON!! WOOHOO!! then derrick screwed it up :(.. anywaiz.. then we had praise practice.. and then thankfully robert was there and we practiced our song for special music "Lord I Want to Be a Sacrifice".. and then at 11 i went home  SATURDAY (today): went to church of course.. me n belinda were the only ones in earliteens class.. but it was fun.. n then we sang praise.. the youth.. and then me n shan went in the back to practice our song for special music.. and we recruited derrick to help us harmonize.. and then it was time to sing!! i think we sounded pretty good considering we chose the song 2 days before performing and practiced the DAY before and recruited derrick on the day OF singing!! hehe.. and then after church came home and ate and then we went down to richmond to visit sum relatives.. but i was sleepy so i stayed in the car n slept.. after a refreshing hour-or-so-nap us and the dukes went to richmond nature park for a walk.. it was fun.. i talked to malc the whole time.. hehe.. and then we came home and we had worship and then i played on th epiano for a while.. it was sorta fun!! well anywaiz.. tomoro we goin to the pne!! and then on tuesda im going to JH for a meeting with the counsellor for my classes.. and i think ill get my schedule!! yay!! and then also on tuesday im goin school clothes shopping!!
