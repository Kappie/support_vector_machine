I know I can do this, but I feel I need to prep more. I was watching the newly hired teachers demo lesson plans for us, wow, I really need to step up my game. However, with time and practice I'm sure I'll become better. I just felt so outmatched. I've just got to remember these teachers have had at least a student teaching experience which I have yet to have, and I'm sure I'm going to benefit greatly. If this new faculty is any indication of the teachers I'll be encountering I'm even more excited, they all seem like good people.  I'm already feeling like a week and a half isn't enough time. I've got so much to do, between reviewing subject matter, to going over all my information on student teaching policies, to reorganizing my room with my new file cabinets and desk space, to finding homes for new clothing, getting some maroon and white in my wardrobe, doing laundry, other errands, working out, and finding time for a little fun here and there. It is really going to go by fast. I should really thank the recent ex for giving me my time back, I'm just now realizing how precious it is. A lot of other family and friend crisis are going on around me in addition to my individual craziness, and I'm glad I can focus on them and on myself with the time I have right now. I really don't know if I can spread myself any thinner, but I guess that remains to be seen. I'm sure it's possible, but I'd rather not find out if I can help it.  I felt like complete crap today. I was fine all day until I got home around three, and then I just hit this wall, like I had been out partying' till the early AM, and I hadn't been. It really was weird, I started to feel that spinning sensation, weird when you only have one vodka/cranberry and water, and you were only out for an hour or so. Maybe I'm getting a bit of a cold too and my equilibrium is just off, I have been sneezing a lot, going in and out of freezing air conditioning and hot outside air. That usually does get me a bit sick. Alright, got to sleep, one more long ass day, then it's time for some cleaning, shopping, and studying. Voila! Merci! (had to sit through a basic French lesson today, hehe)
