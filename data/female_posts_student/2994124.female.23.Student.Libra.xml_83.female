I HATE having lots of stuff, or even feeling like I have too much stuff, I get really concerned and paranoid about it.  And this time it's especially worse because I am having to leave different piles in different people's houses and so have to apologise and feel guilty/bad to more people.  I just want a VW van. And my room looks so bare and miserable and also I have nothing to do tonight - except blog for you guys. Aahhh what would I do without you?  Last night I fell asleep chuckling. No not to Vinyl Cafe this time but to Victoria Wood. She is a british comedian and just so side-splittingly, wet-yourselfly funny.  Like what she talks about is just everyday life things, but in a way that makes them so totally hilarious. The bit I was watching last night was all about her problems with gyneocological pain and having a hysterectomy - doesn't sound the funniest of things, but believe me it was.    How come Aimee doesn't have a guestbook? Get one Aimee I need to ask you questions! Like why are your days in French?  My copy of the first season of ER has arrived into the shop! I'm going to pick it up tomorrow. But I can't watch it for a whole week anyway - Aaaaaahhhhhhhhh. My patience will have to continue to be tested.  Oh and I definitely am in for a blog reunion just tell me when and where and I'm sure I can just pop in.
