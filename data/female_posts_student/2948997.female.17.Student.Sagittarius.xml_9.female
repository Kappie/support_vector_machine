I don't need love from others. I don't need to share myself with anyone I don't need to worry about other people bullshit and emotions... THEN WHY DOES THIS HURT EVERYTIME!  This year, I have been fucked with, rejected with, screwed with, played with and almost any other adjective you can think of.  Why do I care so much? Why do I feel like someone else has to validate me? Why am I not comfortable being myself...alone. Why do I feel like there has to be another there. I'm a pretty fucking indepedent person...but why do I want a boy there to hold my hand and make me feel good about myself?   Was I not good enough for you? Where you not drunken enough? Was I too young? or too immature? Was I too fat?  Not intelligent enough? Too time consuming?  Fuck! It must be me thats the problem, it always is. Why do I feel like this again!   I've never experienced love...cause I'm a fuckhead.
