Not to be mean or obnoxious but I don’t want to. I rather be friends and remain as friends until he decided we cant be friends anymore. I don’t want to break the rules of us being friends. I don’t want to part from anyone because that breaks my heart.   He has just recently called me just to see if my injury had gone away. That was sweet of him. He also asked me out to have dinner with him. His excuse was Chinese New Year and that he doesn’t have anyone to have dinner with. Oh please, that is so lame, its not gonna work on me. I still want him by my side, just to make me smile.   I used to date Harvey and Harvey is Ben’s friend, I cant do it. Especially when Harvey was my ex. Even tho Harvey is cool about it and all but nah I’ll pass. I rather start a commitment with a total stranger. Someone brand new who doesn’t know a thing about me. I’ll just wait, it doesn’t matter how long, I’ll just wait.   Everyone knows that I have been single for the last 18 months. Wow! That’s a very long time for a gal like me. I love it and I’m happy this way. I don’t want to have anyone telling what to do, or who to hang out with, or you cant do this, you cant buy that. That’s just not me, I cant picture myself in that situation.
