But, then there is always that dumbass who proves you wrong.  I am not going to mention his name...  if he ever reads this, you know who you are and don't even think of fucking talking to me for a while. Anyways.... on to a better note.  I hung out with one of my buddies from work a couple of nights ago, which was awesome.  But, hey its all good right?   I am attempting to find a lot of hours at work.. so you will be seeing me at Target a lot lately.  I am trying to pull off 35 hours a week.  Probably not going to happen.. but its worth a try.  I am actually going to attempt to close tomorrow night.  Which is all good, cause the closing manager is Art, and he is awesome.  But, I am off today... so woohoo. Have you ever noticed that right before school gets out, you are always so excited and then summer hits and you are bored out, of your fucking minds.  I do.  I am bored right now. Until I feel like rambling again... later
