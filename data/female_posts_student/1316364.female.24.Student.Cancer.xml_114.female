Although I was very reluctant to come in today I also realize that since it is Wednesday, it also means that my workweek will be only 3 days long, so it really isn’t too bad, at least not yet anyway.   It was very nice to be able to get away from everything for a few days however when I came back, all of the stuff I ran away from, was still here waiting for me. I didn’t have the worse birthday but at the same time is could have been better. My friend Melissa took me out to dinner and I am pretty sure that my mom is going to do cake and ice cream for me this upcoming weekend since we were unable to do so on my birthday.   The trip was nice, despite the problems we had with my two nephews and their lack of listening skills. Saturday we arrived in Anaheim around 1:00 pm and got settled into our hotel room. Later that evening we went for a swim and then ordered out for Pizza dinner. The pizza place prided them-selves by claiming that they were the best pizza in all of California, I actually beg to differ (Pizza Guys will always be my personal favorite). Then Sunday we woke up and drove to Knottsberry Farm. It was ok there, I wasn’t too impressed although they had an Ice show called “The World According to Snoopy”, and the show was great. I didn’t get to ride too many rides but I figured that my day would come on Monday when we made our way to Disneyland. I rode a bunch of rides and even rode the Matter Horn for the first time ever. Then at the end of the day I watched in amazement as the closing fireworks lit up the night sky. In my head I was thinking about how beautiful it was and how I had wished that Jesse was there to see it with me. I think I want to go to Disneyland with Jesse when he comes home so we can watch the Fireworks litter the sky with glitter. The car ride home was very long and mostly all I wanted to do was sleep. My nephews got carsick a little bit in the beginning, but the rest of the drive home they were pretty good (as good as you could expect a 5 year old and a 6 year old to be after being stuck in a car for 6+ hours).   Well it’s a little before 2:00 pm here and I really wish I was at home. I am still very sleepy and for some reason I cannot snap myself out of it. I haven’t taken my medication for two days and I am feeling the effects of not taking it, so I have a feeling that is why I am so sleepy, that or I am still pooped from all of the walking I did these last 4 days.  I do have to say that Disneyland is a great diversion to thought, and I know part of me is still there.
