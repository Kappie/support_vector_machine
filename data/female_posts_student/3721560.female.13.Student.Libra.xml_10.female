I got road rashy on my elbows because of the tube but it was worth it. Virginia fell 3 times in a row, but Most the time it wasn't her fault. We hit this huge wave and When we landed I was on my knees and she was in the water. We also watched the Culver Academy parade. it is the Military prep school. It looked like a neat place to goe. Virginia atempted to get a fish off a hook (By the way, she didn't even catch the fish) But I got two pics of it. Well I'm really tired soe I'm going to sleep. Later.
