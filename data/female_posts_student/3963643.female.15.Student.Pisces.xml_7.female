I went through like 3 water bottles at tryouts! i was " dehydrated " lol steph. Ya so Im not sure if i want to do anything tonight.. i think im too tired but i really want to go hear Hillary sing! and i want to go to movie on the hill but last time i went it was stupid lol.    Tomorrow -- we have a soccer game at 645 i think against explosion(first team) should be fun. This weekend we have a soccer tourney (we have to win this one you guys!!!) and i think we find out the teams sometime after that..    *Take it to the extreme or dont take it at all*
