I have a similar obsession with empty books and blank stationary.  Sometimes I even go to the trouble of emptying a box or ripping the pages out of a former journal just so that I can make it empty again.  For this box, I took out a pair of tiny scissors, some glue, staples, paper clips and an eraser to make room for whatever mysterious objects I choose to put in it next.  Hmm...
