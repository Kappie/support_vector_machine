I actually can literaly write whatever and about whoever I want and I won't get into any trouble do to the fact that my teacher won' tsee this thing. I have my 100% privacy. Ok let me see. Later on today I am going to write in here a story that I wrote a long time ago. My friends told me that it was a really creepy story. Maybe you will think so too. Right now I am going through alot in my life and I feel like there is no one that I can talk to. Now I can talk to you because I know that I can trust you. Who are you gonna tell ain't no boby know the email address/webaddress what ever. Look. I am going trough a rough time because my grandmother died and I was really close to her. I mean I new that she was going to die sonner or later but I thought that it would be later not sooner. She had cancer but I never thought that I would actually lose her ya know. I know this is probably very stupid. But when she died like a part of me died with her. And then I have the fact that she died on New Years day. At 3:30 in the morning. It is probably really stupid more me to care but I was really close tho my grandmother. You wanna know something really weird. At least I thought that it was, When my mother was 14 her father died and when I was 14 my grandmother died. Talk to ya tommorow.
