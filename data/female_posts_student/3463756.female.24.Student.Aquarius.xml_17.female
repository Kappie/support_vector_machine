But its perfectly possible for two strange guys to bond and become pals without so much as a hint of envy in it. Even if the envy is there, it is hidden. Its just strange.  with the day's bit of wisdom having been expressed, it's time to chronicle the weekend's events. Albeit a bit late. But still. I forgot to take my camera with me but I have the pictures in my head. I hope they stay there. K says he liked Kent. The quiet appealed to him. Actually I like the part about it being quiet. It's only the inaccessibility that I have a problem with.  Moving to a new place is a scary thing when you think about it. But this time I think its more. I mean staying as a paying guest has its perks but I think it would also have its disadvantages.two guys and another girl. Sure the guys seem helpful but who knows. My landlady seems ok but again who knows. She maymorph into the wicked witch of the east later on.  and then of course we have my ex-flatmates. Rashmi was ok. We had our differences but we moved past those and we remain friends. But whatabout the others. All I say is, the less said the better especially since at the moment all my stuff that's lost still has to make a reappearance.  Women don't like one another. The simple fact of the matter.
