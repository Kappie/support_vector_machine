The fact that I was with the family for 4 days straight! AHHHH I'm about ready to pack my bags...NOW...and head off to Edgewood tomorrow morning! I was sleeping in the same room with 5 other people, 4 of which snored! AHH, I dont think i got a decent night's sleep the whole stay!   Well besides the point, the weather was great, the water was fairly warm and the golf was amazing! We arrived on Thursday to the Chula Vista--a resort in the Upper Dells--the non-commercialized Dells. The resort was beautiful of course, and the river was even more glamourous! Wow, it was soo pretty seeing all the bluffs and river boats floating down late at night! So Thursday was kind of uneventful--alot of sitting near the pool, and going down the slides. But I did make a run into town to get a book, the prequel to Da Vinci Code: Angels and Demons. Personally, I like it alot more than the Da Vinci Code...but that was amazing as well!So we stayed in the resort for dinner, and rested (or tried to rest) the remainder of the night.  Friday was an awesome day! We got up...kinda late, and proceeded to play some golf at  Coldwater Canyon -a golf course nearby the resort. So we played away, front nine kinda sucked for me! shot a 48, but my dad shot a 1 under 34. So we headed on the back nine, myself hoping for a better back, and my dad looked to keep his "up to par" game going strong. So on the 13th hole, when my dad takes honors to go first, on the par-3; he takes out my 9-iron, and says "Kaity, how bout your 9?!" And in my mind right now im going,  wow, I need to birdie this hole, and my dad to bogey to be even with him.  So i didn't even hear him say that to me as I sat in wonderment in the Cart. So he gets up to tee off, with a ball he found in the woods, a Strata 4 (couldn't have picked a crappier ball), and smacks its dimples with my 9-iron, and i yell " nice shot dad, what club was that?" Obviously, wasnt paying attention before when he was talking...whoops! And he didn't answer my question, he replied with, "go... go..., get in the hole!! And God answered his prayers! It got in that hole!  My Dad had his first Hole-In-One!  And his kids were there to watch him do it! My dad started crying right away, as we ran up the path to jump on him with hugs! He cried, I cried, my brother cried! It was amazing! And to make it even better...he had witnesses! You can't have an official Hole-In-One, unless you have witnesses that aren't related to you! And there were some: on the next tee, they saw the whole thing! It made it even better! So got some great pics, of him picking it out of the hole...wow, i still get chills from talking about it! That might sound lame, but for a person who has been playing for 40 years, and to have never gotten one before, made it soo awesome. He deserved it! It was soo cool. Its not like it happens everyday! Oh yeah, and to make his visit to Coldwater Canyon even better...It was the courses first hole in one ever in the history of the course. So he had his picture taken, and given like $50 in free stuff...oh yeah...and if anyone wants brats--we have a life time supply now! hahaha  Saturday was ok i guess...nothing compared to the day before. We sat around the pool all day, got a nice, semi-even tan, and read my book...got half way through it in like 2 hours...its sooo damn good! So after our lax day in the sun...we got ready to hit up DAMON'S, a restaurant near the Kalahari. This is the coolest eating place in the dells, with amazing food. There are 5 screens to watch any television show imaginable...and you can watch all and listen to one, at your table. So we listened to the brewer game, and played this nationally interactive trivia game on screen 3. This game is awesome. Kind of like Jeopardy, but you play with the whole restaurant, and score as a team basically against tons of otherrestaurants across the nation! So our team, ZOGS, are kickin' some restaurant ass! We end up taking second in the restaurant behind this man who eats there every night, and knows all the questions by heart. Gay. So we got some certificate for placing in the top three. It was pretty cool!   So after our rendezvous through the Lake Delton/Dells area...we head on back to room to watch the Punisher...that thankfully didnt work! hahaha So we turned on Ocean's Eleven--it was on T.V. We all fell asleep to the replay that happened around 11:30.   Today: I drove with my brother around the Dells (i drove my own car up, too avoid sitting with the sis and her friend), looking for a place to buy sweatshirts that you could personalize! well we found one..actually we found like 6 places that did that. So I got a red sweatshirt, with a lifeguard logo, and Herzog on the butt of the sweatshirt...it turned out really cool actually! The we headed to Timber Falls, to play some Mini-Golf, it was a pretty cool mini golf course! It was on the river ,and lots of pretty flowers. Needless to say, I kicked my brother's Ass! hahaha   Alas, it was time to head back to reality, and endure the hour and half ride home. Ha make it and hour and 15 minutes, going 80 with a rest stop! hahaha We even got off at an exit to fix my loose hood (that was scary) and found out that the on ramp to east-94...didn't exist...so we had to find our way home, or see a freeway sign. We ended up taking abackroad for like 5 minutes and luckily, my experience with theOconomowoc and Dousman area (thanks to golf and skiing),I knew where i was going. It was still pretty impressive that I drove 100 miles in an hour and 20 ish minutes! haha  So it was an eventfully delightful weekend excursion! minus the snoring! So I had fun, the papa had fun, and I am now in dire need for some good sleep...so off to bed!
