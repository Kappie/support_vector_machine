Especially when it comes to the yellow pillow!) I was also surprised by the amount of time and work people put into this (i.e. Ash, Jane and the drawing, Ali and the rug). I had absolutely no idea. Well, that's a lie. The streamers gave it away as soon as I walked in the door. :P  I LOVE ALL YOU PEOPLE! YOU ROCK!   And now it's time for Sarah to do some more interior decorating. (GRIN!)  "I've been rejected...twice!"
