This in turn was in response to the debate about the ranking system. This was the site's richest and most exciting period and I thought at the time m3r had a bright future.   Unfortunately since then the site has been knocked off course by the seemingly interminable bullying saga and teacher intervention.   Although their have been interesting posts since none have generated the same heated but intelligent debate. At Phillip Island I had a great discussion with Neal and Hart on a whole range of issues from America's place in the world to personal religious belief to fundametalism to Guatemalan fruit companies. This is the kind of debate we've been missing. Now that Neal is back in Iowa we have a golden opportunity to hear about the opinions of his friends back there and return to the best days of m3r. Start posting and commenting on things you feel need talking about. You don't have to be deliberately controversial, just say what you believe, and who gives a fuck what any teacher thinks about it.   Admin. If anyone is wondering why there are a few deleted comments around, its because i'm now enforcing our new policy, which is to delete all comments made anonymously. btw this does not mean if you don't have an account with blogger.com you can't post comments, just make sure you leave your name or else your comment will be deleted.
