(there's a summary there) It seemed like it was a book about  me ! The girl in the story was very involved in school, had a good mom, a rebellious older sister, no dad in sight (my real one isn't), and lived such a routine life everyday with her brainiac boyfriend (that's the part where it's not like me.)  Then she gets a job at a catering place, which at every event, something goes wrong, is lost, is broken... Sounds like Gallucci's to me. But the odd thing is, she loves it! Sounds all too familiar. I'd never quit that job if I could live with my mom forever and not have to go to college... but then there's reality.  But after working there, she's opened up to new things, new people, and a new outlook. Oh, and one more thing she did in the book that's like me, she found the courage to talk to her mom about her life. Not just work, but life. I tried that a while back, but all that got me were tears and a fight.   I've been embracing the curls in my hair lately, and I think I'm not going to blowdry it everyday like I've done for the past 4 years.  My head needs a break.
