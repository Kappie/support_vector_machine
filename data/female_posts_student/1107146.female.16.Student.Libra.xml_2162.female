Linds-- last night after the show (which was amazing and a packed house) we went to Waffle House (theater tradition...but gross) and the BA kids showed up.  I was annoyed cause Alex wasn't there.  I asked this one kid why not and he was like "Oh, Alex like ran out after we were done."  I was sad.  (Giving pouty face).  It's Michael Nelson's birthday!  YAY!
