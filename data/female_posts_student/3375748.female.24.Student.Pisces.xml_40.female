There is too many cats outsied of my house, and it is so easy to see other cats as Lemo. There is one cat which is so CUTE!!! Really, really Cute. She came to us and wanted to be touched by us. That's a way a cat should be.   But, no matter what. I miss Lemo and wanna her to come back. It's so hard to looking for a cat. I just hope everything will be fine with her.   Lemo!!! Come back, Please!   柠檬茶还是没有回来，这已经是第四天了。我住的房子外面有太多的猫，所以一下在那么多的猫里面更本就找不到柠檬茶。虽然在那么多的猫中，我们发现了一只很可爱的猫，她非常喜欢和人打交道。可是即使其它的猫猫再可爱，我还是思念柠檬茶。  柠檬茶，快回来哦！！
