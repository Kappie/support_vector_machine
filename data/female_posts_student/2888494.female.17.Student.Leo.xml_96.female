Of course I'll be cursing you again the second my ineptitude befuddles my blogging experience, but until then you're just dandy in my book!  I’ve discovered photo-blogging, you see, and I can almost use it completely. How absolutely lovely! Pictures on a blog! Who knew? There are some things that continue to perplex me, mainly one thing: I want to put my picture on my profile and simply don’t know how. How do I find the URL to the picture that blogger posted for me? Where did it go? Where is the URL? Did I lose the URL? What happened to the URL? I grow discouraged about the URL (yes, Al Franken, we love you…).  This is definitely NOT good for my blog, though. Finally all of you will see how truly narcissistic I am. I kid you not. I am completely in love with myself, I am. I could lie to you and pretend to be humble and all that jazz, but what’s the point? I’m sure you’ve figured it out by now. I am THE MOST SELF CENTERED PERSON IN THE WORLD! Starving children in Africa? What did you say? Oppressed refugees back east? Poor defenseless animals? What? You’re not speaking my language, darling. I understand the following, and the following only: ME! Wheeeee…..    Yeah….I’m a bad person….Oh well. At least I flaunt it and revel in it. Surely there’s some merit in that.   I’m going to go see if I can fix my profile. Then eat a pop tart. Then pass out on my couch.  OH! The possibilities!
