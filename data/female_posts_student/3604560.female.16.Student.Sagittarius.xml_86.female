I refrained from using the other word for phallus coz this sounds so much less rude...dunno why.   Anyways, what a nice way to start of the holidays. I was so bored yesterday I read the INSTRUCTION MANUAL FOR MY CAMERA. And it turns out there are soooooooooooooo many cool special features I can use. I can fade into a scene or make an 'old movie' style movie or film in pastel colours, which is really cool and retro. Can't wait to start putting you guys on film (or in my case, DVD)!!! Keep thinking 'bout what you guys wanna do coz there are heaps of possibilities (though limited by film-ability) Evelyn, when's the pancake day out? Hopefully not this weekend coz I'll be in Woollongong (sp?).   So Long Fairwell Auf Wiedersen Goodbye  Namárië
