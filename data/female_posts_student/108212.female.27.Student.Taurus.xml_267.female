Later on, after jumping through some more hoops, I could say "wow, I was lucky I made iot through without getting discouraged", because I discourage easily.  I get lots of positive feedback, very little negative - I think it speaks more to the politeness of my colleagues than my outstanding talent.  I actually find my compositions and performances pretty mundane, BUT a lot of what passes for good songwriting and arranging is even worse.  And knowing that the big boys find my tossed-off work worthy of publishing makes me hopeful that they'll like the stuff we actually use in my church even better.  I was supposed to meet with a publisher's rep last month, and haven't had time (60-75 hour weeks on the day gig).  I'm going to try to set something up soon.  Meantime, Glee, you keep it up.  I'll be watching for you on Oprah.  Daf
