Actors get lots of recognition nowadays and many have turned to politics to rise further in power and fame. But i should say, not all are that good as politicl leaders (Dont get me wrong here, I'm not trying to say that Ronald Reagan was a bad president) But nevertherless, people still vote for them- is it just a dillusion after watching "their" heroic deeds in movies or do they really trust those actors to lead their nation to greater heights?
