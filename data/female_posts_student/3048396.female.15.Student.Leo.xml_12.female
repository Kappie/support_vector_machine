I don't know why. Eh today is a good day. Ive only been awake a little over an hour but still I know its gonna be good. I might go over to Kims today to watch a movie...brings back memories....and do some other amusing stuff lol. Yeah  *sigh* Church last night went pretty well...it was short and sweet. Then the Trinity highschool kids came back over to our church and set up tables and made the fruit cups for sunday. I was so sticky afterwards..a whole bunch of orange juice got spilled on me. Eh lol. It was fun tho. SO yeah I guess I dont have much more to say....  -Tara
