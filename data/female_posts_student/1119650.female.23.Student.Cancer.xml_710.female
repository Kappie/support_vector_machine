Now since this is my first post I must proclaim that I am not 'Officially' working for Teds but I love the place so damn much I just have to plug it whenever I get a chance.   Ole' OneEye is having a birthday this weekend but the weather is going to suck therefore so is his birthday. Oh well. I must apologize to the legions that waited for my post. Hank will be quicker on the toes in the future. That is all for now. I shall return to the faithful on Monday. "You Stay Classy Blogger Friends!"
