It's stupid and I hate it.  I'm whinning now.  Does whinning have 1 'n' or 2?  I donut care.  I donut.  I donut.  I donut.  I think it would be a funner word if they changed do not to donut.  I donut want to go.  I donut like green eggs and ham.  I like donut...s.  Look at it.  It's weird.  donut donut donut donut donut donut donut donut.  Is it weird for you yet? donut donut donut donut.   Oh, but today...I talked to Nikol.  Everything is peachy keen.  She's getting used to being treated (by Ned) like she's worth more than she'll ever know.  I'm happy for her.  A lot of guys are assholes.  She scored.  Go Nikol, it's your birthday.  We gon' party like it's your birthday, we gon' sip bacardi like it's your birthday.  Cause you know we don't give a **** cause it's your birthday.  Hey, when is your birthday, Nikol? I drank bacardi one time.  I got soooooo drunk that it started to taste like water. I drank gin one time.  I got soooooo drunk that it started to taste like water. I drank E one time.  I go soooooo drunk that it started to taste like water. I drank beer one time.  Then I threw up.  Too much liquid in my belly. I know my limit now.   4 shots of doctor, 2 shots of hot sex, 3 mixed drinks, 2 shots of really hard stuff, 2 beers...on a full stomach. Otherwise it's just 2 beers and 2 shots of anything. Whatelse about today? My car is a piece of shit.  No it's not, I love my car.  It's a good car.  It just has some bad parts.  They are getting replaced on wednesday.  It's gonna be over $300 and I really don't have the money to pay for it.  So, they are just going to have to work with me.   Well, I think that's all.  Oh, I got an peanut m today that was all chocolate.  I wasn't impressed.
