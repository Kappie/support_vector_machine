We talked about everything from school to prom to music to where we are at. We were just catching up on what's been going on in the past 3 months. I guess I realized that we can be good friends after all that happened. It was great. And not awkward  at all . Ok, so maybe some of it was awkward. I had a lot of fun actually. Basically, I'm not planning out anything. I'm saying whatever happens happens. I can't say that we are going to get back together or even hang out again for a while. I'd like to hang out again sometime but I'm not going to force anything. All I know is that I had fun for once and I hope Gavin did too. Gavin left around 12:30 and I came inside to questions from my mom. "What were you doing?" and "You aren't getting back together with him are you?" and "What could you possibly talk about for 4 hours?" and questions like that. I hated it. I know that she just doesn't want to see me get hurt again because she cares.  And to all my friends. Please don't yell at me for doing this. If you tell me not to do something it's just going to make me rebel against you and want to do this even more. You are my friends and I respect you opinion but if I am going to make mistakes you can't stop me. I will just have to learn from my mistakes.  So, right now I'm just downloading music. Then later I am going to look for a new matress with my mom when she gets home from church. But I will be home later tonight if anyone wants to do anything because I'm just going to be bored again. Then tomorrow I'm going to be bored again.  Listening to: [Memory by Sugarcult]   This may never start. We could fall apart. And I'd be your memory. Lost your sense of fear.  Feelings insincere.  Can I be your memory?     So get back, back, back to where we lasted. Just like I imagine. I could never feel this way. So get back, back, back to the disaster. My heart's beating faster. Holding on to feel the same.    This may never start. I'll tear us apart. Cannot be your enemy. Losing half a year. Waiting for you here  I'd be your anything.     So get back, back, back to where we lasted. Just like I imagine. I could never feel this way. So get back, back, back to the disaster. My heart's beating faster. Holding on to feel the same.    This may never start. Tearing out my heart. I'd be your memory. Lost your sense of fear. (I'd be your memory) Feelings disappear.  Can I be your memory?     So get back, back, back to where we lasted. Just like I imagine. I could never feel this way. So get back, back, back to the disaster. My heart's beating faster. Holding on to feel the same.    This may never start. We could fall apart  And I'd be your memory. Lost your sense of fear. Feelings insincere.  Can I be your memory ?
