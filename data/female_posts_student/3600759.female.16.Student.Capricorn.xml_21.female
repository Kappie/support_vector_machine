And I miss everyone SOOO much. I want everyone to keep in touch and remember: Keep a smile on your face, and faith in your heart and everything else will fall into place. Your future is what you make of it and if you want something you will make it happen and I know every single one of you can do what ever it is you want to do. I have NO voice from all of the cheers including: Boom Chicka Boom, Jigg-a-low, Chester, HOBY, OUTSTANDING and soo many more. But it was well worth it. No Voice= SO much fun!!! I love you all.
