Like today...constant good moodness. Up until just recently, because people's bad moods are easy to catch. I hate that! I wish people with bad moods would just stay away from me when I'm happy. If I'm in a bad mood, I don't go hang around someone who's all happy and bitch to them. Or I try not to. Happy people should group with happy people, and sad, pissy people should go vent to one another...not anyone else. That's okay though. I'm still pretty happy.  Yeah, things have been good lately.  "There's a new wind blowin' like I've never known, I'm breathin' deeper than I've ever done, And it sure feels good, to finally feel the way I do, I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you."  I just realized I've quoted that song before in my blog. Haha...how funny.  I'm hungry.  Au revoir you crazies.
