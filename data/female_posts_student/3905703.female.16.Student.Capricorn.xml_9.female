And though it was short and sweet ,  Vijeta's speech had the audience in splits (for totally different reasons),Princi dahling decided not to give us the icecream. I dont kno what it is with our class but we have never been getting icecreams from class VIII. After that in the last period we were given our Chem papers. Mr. Dhawan seems to have taken out all his anger on us while checking the papers. The highest till now is 52 or something. No, i am not revealing my marks. But this was a disaster. Not something with which I would like to end my day at school.  As Prateek seemed to have changed his hairstyle (he now combs his hair back), Roaming Saint has retired back to his original hairstyle which is much better.  T end this post I would like to thank Sinha for all the compliments he showered on me about our class assembly in the break (and in the process ruining it as each time I had to shoo him off from our class).  By the way our class has been shifted to E106.
