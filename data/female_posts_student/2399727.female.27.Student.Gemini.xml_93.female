Mom off so I got a ride to Burlington to hop a train today rather than having to take the bus yesterday.  Very grateful.  Finally figured out how to make all the font much larger on my screen (Windows 98 isn't as straightforward as XP.)  Can finally see without squinting at it!  Big doc appt Friday.  1/2 afraid of what she'll tell me, 1/2 excited about knowing the truth.  More to come...
