We were trying to find McDonalds' but only found Burger King. So, we changed out of our school T- shirts and wore our newly- printed Class T- shirts which, I MUST SAY, IT SUCKS.  * After lunch, we went to Swensens and ate Regular Earthquake. Then, we fooled around with their dry ice. I must say that the dry ice was very fun. I LOVE IT! Go and try it! * Later, we went to viewing mall but it turned out to be boring. Not that kind of drama I saw on TV, you know, the parting scene and crying part. *Boo- Hoo* * Then, we went to take the Sky- train and went to T1. Same, boring... And the pics we took did not came out. *Waaahhhhh*  DESTINATION: Tampines  * Actually, nothing much. All we did was to window- shop the whole of Tampines Mall and I went to try the Winnie The Pooh vending machine and got a Eeyore (spelling like that?)  * Then we went to Century Square and went to Delifrance and I spend all my remaining money on a CUP OF TEA! Jeezzz.....  So by the time I went back it was quite late. But nevertheless, I had a great time at least it was not an unlucky day....
