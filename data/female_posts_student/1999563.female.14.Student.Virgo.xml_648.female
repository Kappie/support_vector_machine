I mean last spring was horrible!! Who would wear Uggs with a mini skirt? I mean really. The fashion industry was doomed with that mistake. geez. I should be the one who makes the decisions of what goes on the racks. Iknow what people will acctually wear. Hot sweaty boots made friend lamg hair? I think not. Save the Lambs!!   Today I went to Katies house. So fun!!! We went for a walk and as a joke we [Abby, Heather, Johanna, and I] lost katie and nick. We thought they were  still following us but when we got back to Katies hosue they weren't there and it took them like 20 minutes to come back. fun times.  I better goooo, talk to you all later!
