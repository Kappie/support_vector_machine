In his computer age, the most astonishing ‘computer’ in the world is still the human body. No wonder, the psalmist said, “ I am fearfully and wonderfully made.” Even today with modern science and technology, the secrets of the human body are still imperfectly understood. Fresh discoveries are constantly being made and new wonders revealed.  For thousands of years, people have tried to understand the brain. The ancient Greeks thought it was like a radiator to cool the blood. In this century, it has been compared to a switchboard, a computer, and a hologram – and no doubt, it will be likened to any number of machines yet to be invented. But none of these analogues is adequate, for the brain is unique in the universe and unlike anything men have ever made.  The human brain weighs about 1.5kg is the most complex physical structure in the universe. It is the central controlling organ of our nervous system. It controls, watches over, and coordinates nearly all the processes occurring in the body. It collects, evaluates and stores sensory impressions, and effects meaningful responses.   Our brain consists of around 100 billion nerve cells. These are as many as the number of stars in our milky way galaxy. The total length of the nerve fibres in the greater brain(cerebrum) is about 500, 000 km, with some scientists even estimate it to be as much as one million km.  Our ‘command centre’, the brain, would be useless if there were no links to the body. Outside of the brain, the total length of nerve fibres continually carry information and commands to and fro between the brain and all other parts of the body.  In some places, the thickness of the fibres is only one thousandth of a milimetre, but messages travel along them at a speed of about 40metres per second or 144 km/h. This is equal to the speed of a hurricane-force wind. (force12)  The optic nerve, the ‘information connection’ from the eye to the brain, is only 2mm thick, but contains more than one million optic nerves, all insulated from one another. Even in our modern age of optic glass fibre connections. Communications engineers can only dream of having a ‘cable’ with such high0tech capabilities.  We can normally distinguish between around 10, 000 varios smells, but even this remarkable ability can be greatly enhanced with practice, as in the case of professional wine and coffee tasters.  Your heart beats 10,000 times in a day, and pumps enough blood in your lifetime to fill a huge skyscraper. In every drop of blood, here are 250 million red blood cells; the number of these calls in all the blood in your body is an unimaginable 250,000,000,000,000!  This entire marvelous body is kept in operation by a small fist-sized pump, the heart which beats 100,000 times a day and transport nourishment throughout the entire body by means of 5 litres of blood. The volume of air passing through our lungs during the course of the day is 20000 litres. This provides the necessary oxygen, and the unwanted gases are exhaled at the same time.  Eyes in different creatures are designed to meet their differing needs. Humans need good resolution and detail, whereas a fly needs speed. We see a fluorescent lamp as flickering at 10 Hz (*cycles per second) but it looks stable to us at 20 Hz, so a normal movie would look like a slide show! This simple act of walking into a room and immediately recognizing all the objects in it requires more computing power than a dozen of the world’s top supercomputers put together.  We echo the words of Psalm 139:14, which David expressed his conviction that his entire being was fashioned by God. To clone a human being is to move from procreation to manufacture of human life. If human beings are special and truly sacred, then we must not do evil to bring about good. Human cloning will probably upset God’s creative work and we will be the ultimate losers for it.
