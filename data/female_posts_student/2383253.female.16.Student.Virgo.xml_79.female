So, yes, boys and girls, I'm stoned at Northwestern. Sitting here in my room, typing away on my laptop as though I don't write enough at this camp. I suddenly had the desire to come online and tell you all about it. You can't really tell people here about when you're stoned, cause you might just get kicked out. That makes it a little lonely.  I saw Dodgeball. I almost cried a lot. Yay for the underdogs. And it actually was funny.  I also finished that story today. It was okay. I don't know- I think I'm gonna fry Futures when I get home. I don't know what to do about the Falconer. There's some romantic notion of becoming a writer for the next year and falling into the stories. I thought I'd try doing that junior year, but there just wasn't time, or I just decided not to. I don't know how much time I'm gonna have next year, I've just stopped thinking of any work that could be associated with school. Shitfuck, I have to fill 2 sketchbooks, and I've definitely not started that. I want to have fun next year.  Next year is gonna be a self-improvement year. I know everybody else probably feels exactly the same way, but I am so over school. I mean, I love the kids and the teachers and the clubs and all of it, but all the other busy bullshit really doesn't matter anymore. Senioritis is just putting everything into perspective.  College apps are gonna be more work than I thought, I think. That makes Falconer, Litmag, Winter's Tale, CityBeat, Coast News, the Reader, Junior Journalists, the Janice Pai Foundation and classes seem a little trivial. It would be a bad time to get overloaded. But I honestly think that there will be less distractions this year. It was a lot of fun to hang out with Nick, but without him, I'll be back in school a lot more and yeah. I also wanted to go to the gym a lot. I hope there's time.  So yes, writing camp. Journalism camp. The time here goes by so strangely. Some days are so fast, and some days are so slow. It's a lot of fun most of the time. I don't know how to not get angry when friends of mine hook up with guys that they are so much better than. They slave over them and obsess about them, and I just think "you guys are so much better than this crap."  Oh! I thought about this earlier... There's this sad energy that hangs around married couples who've just had a baby. The couple looks odd together all of a sudden. They're sad because they realize that they are settling. They can't go marry that supermodel and be a money-making machine. They are anchored into that life that they didn't ever think they wanted. When you have a baby, you're settling. Wherever you are, whatever you're doing- it's suddenly who you are. And for a lot of people, that seems sad.  There were better stoner thoughts earlier today- I'm trying to think of the good ones. There was a really good one about this smoothie worker giving me the wrong smoothie from what I ordered because she knew I was stoned. But of course I couldn't argue it with her, because I'm not capable of any serious argument. And she can look at me and tell me indirectly that she is pissed off with me for coming to her smoothie shop stoned, and laugh because I'm drinking a smoothie I didn't order but paid for. Maybe she just got the order wrong, but I don't think so.  And I remember talking to Nick about how iPods dictated social class. The 15GB, the 20 GB, and the 40 GB. It so reflects social status.  Don't make me feel dumb for typing all this up. I think it was therapeutic. We don't usually put anything deep onto this... and if there's a bad reaction, I guess I'll never do it again. Thank you for your time.
