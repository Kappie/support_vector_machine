One of the closest people to me just suffered a huge loss in her family.  Her father and sister were killed in a plane crash on Wednesday, December 17.  Her uncle was flying it, and her sister was returning home from Spain to spend Christmas with her family and introduce them to her boyfriend, Jose.  I had a really hard time coping with the news, because I just felt so much pain for Tracy and her family.  Yesterday I found out that they died from the crash, so I'm pretty sure that means that they didn't suffer afterwards.  That gave me a little bit of solace.  I am reading about the service right now, and I'm going to get on the phone with my mother to see if I can go (it's on Monday).  I will write later.
