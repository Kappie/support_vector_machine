Bask in his wisdom, for it can help those who are in a time of darkness.  - Whoever says too much of a good thing is not enough speaks the truth.  - Those who say there's nothing like a good cup of tea for calming the nerves never had real tea. It's like a syringe of adrenaline straight to the heart.  - Threats, promises, and good intentions don't amount to action.  - Every adventure requires a first step. Trite but true, even here (Wonderland).  - Only the foolish believe suffering is just wages of being different.  - Only the insane equate pain with success.  - Every picture tells a story. Sometimes we don't like the ending. Sometimes we don't understand it.   - Cats are colourblind, you know. Kaleidascopes hold no interest for us.  - A reflection sometimes exposes more reality than the object it echoes.  - Look staight ahead, or askance. Whichever way you choose you must always look in the right direction.  - Bravery and I are not on intimate terms. My natural curiosity is tempered with caution. Thus I've lived long.   Next time, a little bit of knowledge from Alice herself.
