If I could bring them with me to Kentucky, it'd be PERFECT but I don't think they'd like a two day car ride!  I barely survived it (had my younger sister in the car....she can be rather pest-like sometimes).  I'm not going to attempt to tell everything that went on in Kentucky in here yet, but as soon as I find my Kentucky Journal, I'll put it on here ^_^
