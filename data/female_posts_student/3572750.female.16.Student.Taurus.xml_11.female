What do you really expect I'm spending the time I could be making money, doing graphics or painting at school. *Sigh I guess it isn't that bad. The teacher seems tough but I'll pass. It's all good thought Mr. L reminds me a lot of him and he was one of my favourite teachers.   *Sigh Keeping two blog sites leaves me neglect this one. I'm not all that fond of blogger. I mean it's a horrible set up. The html on blogger isn't easy to mess aroung with. I like it less than livejournal, that's pretty damn sad because I hate livejournal. Blogger will never be as good as Xanga. Xangas functions are a lot better. It's easier and more private. I love being able to hide entries and only allow some people to read certain ones. Maybe I'll leave this one. *Shrugs I really shoudl change it that damn quote picture is getting annoying.   Complaints: I'm sleep deprived. I don't remember what it feels like to be single. Seriously I stay single for a day or two and than I'm gone off into something new. I have a headache and I've been trying to deny something for the past couple days. I got bruises on my upper thighs (Which my mother freaked about when she saw one of them. I'm just glad she didn't see the rest). I have cuts on my feet from being dragged. I have a spraigned wrist. I'm not so tough, my ex boyfriend saw me and was a little drunk. He decided to beat me. That is the truth and that is what happened yet I guess I'm just accepting it now.  I need a vacation or a reality check. I'm tired of being strong and don't need this shit. All it is doing is making me a bitch because all I do is let everything build up. I'm not one to really complain to others when something is wrong. I build it up till I can't take it anymore. I guess I'm not there really after calming done I realized I'm pretty damn lucky in other ways. I was happy for a while well I thought I was. I mean I'm pretty damn lucky somedays. I have great people in my life, opportunities and if I keep working a good future. *Sigh and I always thought I was pessimistic. Lol Wait that will never change I'm sitll pretty damn pessimistic.
