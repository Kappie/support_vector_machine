That's over seven hours of sleep - plenty of zzz's for the adult I purport to be.  Maybe I'm getting ill.  It's possible.  Either that, or my brain is just rebelling against the alarm clock's tyranny.  New interns today.  I'm sad to see the old ones go.  You never forget your firsts, you know.  I should track those guys down and tell them that I'll remember them forever.  How creepy stalker-girl would that make me?  :)  It is funny to see how intimidated the new batch looks.  I expected them to be just like the ones that left, but I guess that takes time.  I can't even imagine what I looked like last Monday.  Not that I'm really any more confident now, but at least I now know how rounds work!    I have a patient that moans.  I literally could not do a physical exam this morning, because they were moaning too much.  And my addled 6:45am-alarm-clock-hating brain could not figure out how to make it cease and desist.  The nurse threatened to lock me in the room until I made it stop (she suggested a wash cloth in the mouth).  I think she was only half kidding.  I feel bad for the poor patient.  And there don't appear to be any drugs whose main effect is: 'halts moaning, use 1 Tab, bid (adjust for renal dosage).'   This morning, we had a patient die during rounds.  It was not my patient, but I've seen the patient every day.  It was one of the three patients in here that was on a ventilator.  I never want to be on a ventilator.  It looks just awful.  (I also never want anyone sticking any sort of camera/tube down my throat to look at my insides, iccch - it looks like it is horrendous).  The patients on the ventilators are really sad to me.  That said, if I should ever  really  need a ventilator, go ahead - I'm a bit too young to be DNR...  The patient this morning  was  a DNR patient.  I wasn't any where near the room when it happened, so I don't know what the doctors or nurses did...do they just stand there and watch?  I'm not certain.  I'm sure I'll find out someday, though.  My moaning patient is also DNR.  I think this one might pull through, though.  So sleepy am I.  All my patients (except the moaner) are finally leaving the hospital today!  Thank goodness.  It makes less work for me to do in the morning, and I'll get 15 minutes of extra sleep.  Maybe tomorrow I'll have an anti-moaning idea...
