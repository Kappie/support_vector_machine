I am a fan that is not happy right now! So anyways..my day was pretty boring. I went to church..and then I went to work. Work was so slllllloooooow today. Nobody was there for most of the time. I mainly cleaned and talked toChris, Drew, and Ashleywhenever they were on there break. After work mom and Rachael let me drive them home from Meadville (I still have so many hours to go!). Then I watch a little of I love of the 80s Strike Back. I am such a loser for liking shows on Vh1 that talk about pop culture from the past few decades. I didn't live in the 70s..I was born in the late 80s..and so the only decade I can mostly remember is the 90s. Anyways...I'm really bored right now..and I don't want to watch the game..because I'm mad at the Red Sox! So I'll sit here awhile and check on the game later. Later...:)
