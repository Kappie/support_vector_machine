(check it out here if you're bored: http://www.velocityjrnl.com/jrnl/2002/vmd2725ov.html)... but the cabrio is a convertible, and that's just too exciting...but the saturn is a bit more economically practical. it also rides 2 inches off the ground. so i don't know. it's a give or take, and liek i said, it's not particularly in my hands anymore :( poor johnny feels so neglected...haha.. anyhow, see yall tomorrow hopefully.
