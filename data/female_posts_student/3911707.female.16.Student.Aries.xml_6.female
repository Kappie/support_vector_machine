Afterwards be drove around FDL for awhile... for who knows what reason. I was also forced to go to car lots... FUN. When we left FDL, Pat went down County TC, which I thought he was just taking to get back to town faster. That wasn't the case. We pulled into his parent's property, where he takes his 4wheeler. For once, it wasn't my idea to pull over somewhere. I didn't give into the pressure though. I did kiss him, but when he stole my full pack of cigarettes and put them down his pants, I just left them there. Props buddy; nice try. When we got back to town, we were going to find Jereme and do something with him. When we walked up to Jay's, we found him... along with Austin, Cheeto, Shana and Tanya. Earlier I had told Pat that I didn't want to drink (he asked me why I didn't want to go to Sam's going-away-party, and that was my excuse), but when I got up to Jay's, Shana had some UV. Of course... I gave in. I ended up feeling guilty since Pat has "given up drinking" and I just drank infront of him, but the feeling didn't last long. For some reason, the five of them decided to all leave and let us be alone. I ended up getting upset because earlier that night he said something about how people can't always have what they want... and believe me, I know that. I went into our "action-figure room" and laid down... face down. He came and found me and asked me what was wrong. I, of course, said nothing, so he left me in there. Then he disappeared through the front door without me noticing. Shana and Tanya came upstairs and came in the room with me. We whispered to each other about how big of a dick Pat is to me (thinking he was still there) and decided that I needed to forget about it. When we got into the living room, we realized he wasn't there! I was ppppppppissed. After dancing for awhile, like a bunch of dorks, I ran downstairs to find him. There he was, sitting in his car, by himself. I asked him his problem and remember saying something back to him and then running to my van, where I got in and backed out. I went around the parking-lot where I honked my horn without trying to. I realized that it wasn't a good idea to drive home just yet. So I parked my van again and got in his car, where I started crying. He comforted me, but I still wouldn't tell him what was wrong. I promised him that it wasn't anything he did. He had to be home, so I told him to just call me. When I went back upstairs, it was just the guys. Not a good idea. Jereme found a spatchula and used it on my ass, then Austin joined in. They found another one and decided that they needed to slap it at the same time, and I let them. They swung, full-blown. I now have a few bruises in the shape of a spatchula. After viewing it myself in the bathroom, I decided I needed to show them, so I dropped my pants. More than once. Infact, we went to Sam's going-away-party and I dropped them there too. If Pat knew that, oh man... Pat called me later and we talked for an hour about things. I couldn't help but get upset. Saturday I thought he was pissed or sick of me because he wouldn't answer his phone for me, but Sunday night he picked up. Infact, he left Jereme and Tasha's apartment to come over by me. Aw, how fuckin sweet, aye? Saturday night I went to the Union. For once, the guys actually allowed me to play a game of basketball with them, two infact. I don't remember what pissed me off, but I was steamed about a lot of shit and Crystal and I decided to go to Pat's house and light 'em up. Haha. It was fun, yet so childish. Today Shana and I went to McCune. When I went off the high-dive, I must have smacked the water wrong. My ear hurts ...badly. My dad thinks I bruised it. The sun didn't do me any favors either. I feel so tired and worn out from getting too much of it. Good news though - my daddy's back.
