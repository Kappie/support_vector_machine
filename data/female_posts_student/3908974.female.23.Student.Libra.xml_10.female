I've read the paper, eaten a bag of baked doritos, checked my e-mail a million times, read The Poisonwood Bible, painted my nails trailer trash pink, crocheted most of a scarf.  And I still have 2 1/2 hours to go.  Last night I went to a cookout at my good time friend's house.  I like her a lot, but I am not a keg party kind of person.  She's one of those girls with the cel phone that's always ringing, and she's always yelling into it, "DUDE!  AWESOME!  Where are you?"  So different from me and my milder ways.  I had a few beers and then got bored trying to make conversation with the pair of alien looking sorority girls and the lone snobby theater chick who sat next to me on the porch.  Most everyone else was way too cool, with dreadlocks and patchy pants and guitars slung over their shoulders.  That's the Lawrence uniform--It's a happening town.  I used to be into that, but now I just figure I'd rather not spend my time and money cultivating a style.  Seems to me I look fine anyways, but you can't tell what I'm about just by looking at me.  Anyway, the party made me feel like I used to in the cafeteria at highschool, a lonesome yet very obvious misfit looking for a place to park her tray.  I left abruptly and drove around in my truck singing Janis Joplin tunes.  I was drunk.  After that, I went home and tried to pretend I was sober enough to read the New York Times.  All the troubles of the world, the war in Iraq, Sudan, floods in Haiti...It all bled together.  My roommate came home and we went out to some anonymous chain restaurant in the newer part of town and had a few more beers because she's leaving soon.  There's a heightened terror alert on, if that's to be believed.  What good is it to put it on the news?  All we can do is go buy more duct tape and canned peaches.  (Christ I hope nothing happens to her while she's over there.)   We sat on our stoop like old times and drank wine and watched a storm roll in.  Smoked nearly a pack and got a little mushy.  Her and my man are such close friends that things have been weird lately, and I've felt like a bad person for stealing him away.  I told her so, and she just laughed.  She said she takes credit for our nauseating bliss because she facilitated the hooking up.  I gather she encouraged him to respond to my clumsy overtures and warded off other males who thought they wanted to know me better.  I had no idea.  In fact, I had the distinct impression that she was disdainful.  We talked about all kinds of stuff, including the fact that we have a mild drinking problem.  I suppose I have put her a bit to the side lately, but I will make sure to make time for her more.  I told her I'm sorry for being off in Boyville lately but I'll be back.  I am considering becoming a police officer.  Lawrence needs them, and I've been onto it since I read this story in the latest Harpers about a romance between two cops, done as an episodic sketch surrounding the petty crimes they had to fight throughout the day.  I saw a headline in our local paper that the LAPD is hiring.  I would love to do public service like that, and I think I am good in a crisis.  I'd thrive on it.  My only issue with it is that my family, friends, and I all enjoy a pipe now and again.  I think prosecuting harmless drug users is a waste of time and resources.  Other than that, I really feel drawn to it.    There is an open house for the recruitment of female officers next week.  I'm going.  It's kind of like striking out into the unknown, leaving the cradle of academia.  But maybe this could be a good thing for me.
