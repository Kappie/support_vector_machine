On my way home from work walking to catch my bus I saw this guy who looked so familiar but I didn't want to say anything to him in case he wasn't who I thought he was... He was thinking the same but eventually he turned around and said my name and it was my old friend Ryland. We talked and went out for a coffee. It was so nice to bump into someone who I haven't seen in so long, seeing him made me realize exactly how far I have come, and how much I have accomplished in the past few years.
