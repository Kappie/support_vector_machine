(haha i just defeated the purpose of GD) anyhoo. the poor kid- he sneaks out of his house to hang out then he gets nailed in the face with a door- made a pretty schweet, but bloody, mark where his glasses were. Hey hey hey. I accidentally threw caseys frisbee on a roof- my bad. Oh well, not like he hasnt messed or broken any of my shit. Yeah so i realized how retarded i am the other day. I have this set of musical instruments right, Costco shit :), and we had them outfor the party. Few nights later the tambourine was sittin on the couch so i grab it and play right- well for some reason Abba comes on.... dancing queen or some shit, and ya knowthat part where its like "feel the beat on the tambourine"- i wasplayin with that very instrument.... how lame do you have to be to play the tambourine to an abba song- especially one that actually tells you toplay it. shit man- my life...i tell ya. I have no complaints though. Im too tired to complain. (right now) come back later and i could probably bitch your ear off.   Welp this entry is short, but i just got done cleanin up for the birth givers return so i am done.  Get to clean Monaghans tomorrow! Hooray! heh maybe a cabin party is in the cards too i dont know. Well Ciao! Until Time Next
