The one during my nap had Greg in it, and my dream last night had Cameron and Gregory...I need to not think so much at night.   Second day after work, I'm exhausted, and I really didn't even DO anything, but I came home and I was just so tired. I had to take a nap, that never happens to me.   Wierd.  Fireworks on friday :) I always love watching them...I can get mesmorized really quickly. My favorites are the ones that scream after they burst...I love those. I'm such a kid when it comes to fireworks. I still remember seeing them last year with Ed when I stayed with him in New Canaan. That was sweet, one of the really romantic things we ever did together. Mmm, that was nice.   Anyhow,   Meh, I am done for now, I'll write more later if I feel so inclined.
