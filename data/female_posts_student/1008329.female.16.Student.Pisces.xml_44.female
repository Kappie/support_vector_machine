Ur the best.  LlOyDz LEtTeR 2 ME!:   Oh my god! I got so tired of hearing that name! supposively she's really popular at THAT SKOOL, which to me doesn't mean much since- well it is THAT SKOOL! lame THAT SKOOL  kids...half of them are going to die of starvation by trying to become an artist because of THAT SKOOL that makes kids think they can really become rich and famous from drawing...please...REALITY PEOPLE! the only famous artist I know of are dead! and so what if she is semi-popular at some school full of dumb little kids...there's only like 150 dumb little kids there anyway and if DOG likes her, his loss he's crazy and if you guys did happen to get married (which I'd try desperately to stop) he'd probably end up burning your house down or something...don't trip on him. I think of DOG as a BNP,yea maybe a little cuter but take away his semi- ok looks and take away the pyroticness and you've ended up with another BNP, you don't want that- do you?   POP QUIZ : "BNP and DOG, what do they both have in common?"- HOST  "They're both icky!"-contestant "Correctomundo!!...what do we got for em' Johnny?!"-host yes yes how sad it is...anyways yea, so call me @ my dads -Lloyd  ((*ALL NAMES HAVE BEEN CHANGED..EXCEPT LLOYD'S*))
