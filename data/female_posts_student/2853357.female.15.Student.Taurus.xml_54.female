The traffic was absolutly horrible, so we didn't get there until about 9.        We spent the whole damn day in the car...        Found out some disturbing information wich has to do with my mom and  the da vinci code         Hardly slept. I think that was the first time I was homesick... But anyways, I was up at like 3 a.m. when my mom has this bad dream and she started thrashing about and beating me to death. Then my dad wakes her up and she tells us that she dreamed an attacker had gotten into our car and went into the tent and was trying to take me away. Which is ironic because as she was trying to save me in her dream she was beating me to death in real life. (Figures...)        Didn't sleep until long after that... Had a very disturbing dream.        Next day, we went on a hike that should have only been about 2 miles, but it ended up being something like 6 miles... Not to mention it was climbing up this mountain and stuff and it was sweltering hot. We were at this one point and a dog came around the corner, and me without my glasses, thought it was a wolf for a minute or something... O_O LOL.        Um, we got back late. I think we went mini golfing after that... I sucked... My cousins wanted to go to the driving range. (I hit4 and made a complete and utter fool of myself)        Went to mass, it was outside.        Then my dad wanted to go crawdading... That was the highlight of my day. We didn't have a net, but insteadwe had those prongs you stick marshmellows on to roast 'em. Somy cousins and my dad troop intothis mucky stream and poke around.Johnwas freaking out, and Ryan just kept swinging around that stupid cane  staffof his. Jackie was kindafreaking out too because we were just in sandels and they creatureskept swimming passed us.While we were kinda putting around in the shallowsmy dad went into the middle of the creek andhad already caught a bunch. So I tell John and Ryan to go away if they're not helping and they do. SoJackie and I follow my dad, and I told myself I wan't going to get wet...but I did... I was up to my hips trying to catch thelittle suckers. It was pretty fun actually. My dad washaving the time of his life...(He's far sighted in his old age *snigger*, so he had to put hisglasses on... but they kept slipping off, so hehad to wear goggles. His wholefront got wet because wewas bending down in the water to catch 'em.) Did you knowcrawdads swim backwards? Kinda like they're being pulled from their tails, their claws areout in front of them. It was fun, butJackie wasn't really helping either, because she's not very coordinated. So basically it wasme,Jackie, and my dadin this creek by the road, sticking marshmellow prongs into thiscreek andcatching crawdads while the others sat on the bank and did nothing.^_^     We got back much later than we had planned.Ate crawdads and steak. I headed into our tentso I could read... But then the rest of the kids follow me, as always. Then they start making a ruckus with thelaptop and laughing and stuff, andit's hard to read. Blah, blah, blah. Went to bed... woke up last... I had another disturbing dream.     Mom tried to lure meout with some strawberry red vines. Surprisingly, it didn't work... then Ryan came in and flashed them in my face (He loves to annoy me awake).We still had one more crawdad incooler, so they told us to go put it in the creek.The kids were sacared to hold it...     Actually,I learned about crayfish in the 3rd grade. (I'm so proud of myself!)We paired up with the first graders andof course, one of them stuck their hand right in their face was she wascrying and screaming... Of course, the crayfish held on for dear life... I'm getting side tracked.     So I pickedit up and put it into thecreek and then we entertained ourselves for an hour with a hoolahoop, and an imitation skip it... Then we left at 10:30... Traffic wasterrible, got back at like 6:30.     Camping isn't worth the trip because of the unloading afterward (especially one day).And now I'm back in front of my computer typing this... Don't you just love me?
