And so like there I was, standing at the table looking for my loot, and I get this tap on the shoulder. So's I turn around, and nobody's there. I start to go back to searching the table, and I hear this little gurgly *ahem* from behind me. So's I turn around again, look down, and whaddaya know! It's this little white rabbit dude with red eyes. You know the one from the Cadbury (that's its name, right?) commercials, hiding under that kid's bed?   Love 'em.   So there I were, just standing there, facing this little white rabbit dude. I almost can't believe my eyes, yeah? It's like.. whoa.... and then! Get this!! I couldn't believe my frickin eyes when I saw this one, make sure you're sitting down, guys. And  then   the little white rabbit dude  hopped !!!   ...   AND THEN HE SPOKE!!!   "You don't really expect any chocolate, do you?" the white rabbit dude said in this posh, English-y accent. And I'm like, dude, yeah, it's Easter, you know? And then he's like Santa hasn't brought you anything for years. Why should I give you candy when he doesn't?   I just stand there staring at him, yeah? Looking like, what the hell are you talking about, yeah? All angry and stuff. "If Santa hasn't been giving me presents, then what were all those books  from Santa  under the tree last year?"   Then the little white rabbit dude laughed. I was just about ready to slam the creep into the wall, but the red eyes scared me, yeah? So's anyway, the dude was like, that wasn't from  Santa ! That was from  me!    Okay so like by this time I'm totally freaked. Here's this little fluffball with ears saying that Santa hates me or doesn't exist or somethin  and  that I don't got no Easter loot! I mean like what's the world coming to! If we don't get junk every long weekend, what the hell are we here  for ? Human beings are consumers, yeah?, but without those frickin rabbits and fat dudes we don't have a damn thing to consume!!   And then! Get this!! I couldn't believe my frickin eyes when I saw this one, make sure you're sitting down, guys. And  then   the little white rabbit dude  hopped !!!   ...   AND THEN HE LAUGHED MANIACALLY LIKE DR. EVIL AND SAID, LIKE, HE WAS GONNA KILL ME AND ALL THAT STUFF 'CAUSE I KNEW TOO MUCH!!!   ...   Okay so's that's when I slammed him into the wall and now I've gotta clean up this mess 'fore the rents come down, yeah?   Happy Easter for real, guys. *g*
