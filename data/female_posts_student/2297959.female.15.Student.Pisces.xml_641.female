I had two near death experiences in one day. scary stuff. i'm making a list of CD's I want because there are so many. it's just something to occupy my time. i want to talk to people, i'm feeling lonely even though i hung out with people yesterday. i think it's great that paul (youth pastor of impact) is on VH1 for mentos! that is incredibly funny. i played guitar a lot today and my fingers are hurting. it feels good. i'm kinda excited for homecoming. it's like I want to shop and plan and whatnot but then i'm afraid its going to be bad because last year they only played rap music. so hopefully this year it will at least be a mix. i don't know though. oh well i guess if it's rap music i will just go along with it. hm i'm going to try and use the phone now.
