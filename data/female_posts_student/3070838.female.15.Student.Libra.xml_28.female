I thought I was doing good!  2) Why the F**K did I not get to see Eli as well? I Hate you ann. lol. jk. 3) Why the F**K did I have to sit through career day? I guess it was better than class, but still. 4) Why the F**K do I have to get up at like, 5:00am tomorrow morning?  You know, I hope I don't have any of my relatives reading this lol.  Well, I'll see you the F**K tomorrow ~*F**King Phileda*~ Lol. I'm in a bad mood.
