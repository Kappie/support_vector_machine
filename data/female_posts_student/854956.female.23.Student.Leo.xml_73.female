Um, well, I've taken one test out of three this week.  It was in my music class... had all the music theory stuff in it, and I aced it!  WOOHOO!  I have a test today at 2 in my Early Childhood class.  Well, a quiz.  It's over one chapter... and I'm really not very worried about it, because we take it 2 times.  Once by ourselves, then another time (after discussing it) with groups.  So, then I'm coming home and I'm going to rest a bit, and then call Ricky and see if he wants to come to the Wednesday Lent service at my church since he's not doing anything else and has been bored this week.  Let's see... what else?  Oh!  I have my second proficiency tomorrow in music... all we have to do is play 2 songs on recorder... no piano stuff this time.  :-(  Darn!  After that class my Spring Break begins!!!  :-)  My Texas Politics professor said he wanted to start Spring Break early... so we don't have class Friday and that's my only class!  :-)  HOORAY!  Well, I have to go now, because I'm making ramen soup, and then I wanna go over stuff in my chapter to review for my quiz... :-P  P.S.- Do the WACKY WEDNESDAY!  : D  I'll post more when I have more time... I'll find a funny story to tell... ; )
