I've been on Alex's computer and maybe you will call me a snoop but I opened up a folder on his desktop of different stories, poems, and journals of his. He is a really good writer and he really enjoys doing it. I found out something new about him and I don't really know how to explain it. Maybe it's rude to put it on the internet but I think I am somewhat proud of him. Here's something that he wrote:    "Its difficult to explain the things that I feel, but I feel them and I want to record them however possible. I long for something, I know what it is, and I need it so much it hurts not having it. I feel I am a romantic, I dream of romance, I dream of the ways I will make women feel special. I need romance, I need someone to hold and hold me in return, I need the warmth of friendship, trust, love. I want to feel someone close to me that sees me and understands me, that hears my heart calling. I ache for someone to share my dreams with, to share her dreams with me, to make a bond so deep it cannot be broken whether by time or space. I want to love, and I do love. I love more than anything I know. I have just one problem, my love is either undirected or not returned. I do not know how to begin a relationship that could allow that love. I don’t know how to show them myself, to allow them to feel for me. Its possible I don’t know how to recognize when they do love me back."    I can't help but read more if you know what I mean. My brother does not come off as that type of guy, though he does keep to himself a lot and he is not the most social person in the world. I think I could publish a whole book of all the things he has written, and it wouldn't be a bad one either.
