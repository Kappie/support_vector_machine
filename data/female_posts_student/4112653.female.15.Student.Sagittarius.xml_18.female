"Well, a vampiress is after you and trying to kill you with your own dagger. Satisfied?" he replied curtly. "I know that!" she cried. "But what I don't know is why you're here and what you intend to do to me." "I'm here to take your soul to a better place- where you can find peace." "Why?" she interupted. "Why do you bother to show up after so long and expect a friendly welcome?" He placed a firm hand on her shoulder. "Tittanya- I died but returned for the sole reason of saving your life. Had I not intervened, Marion would have claimed it. Please understand this, and stop looking on me as an enemy. I'm your friend."   She waved his smile away. "No, Damien," she replied, "I have no friends because I don't  need  anyone's help."   "Tittanya..."   "I don't need you!" she screamed. The surreal setting melted away, along with Damien. Before he disappeared, he handed her her a radiating green stone.      And Tittanya was left outside the pub again.
