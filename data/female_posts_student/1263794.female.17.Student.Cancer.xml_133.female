(and if you weren't wondering you should have been) But anyways I was talking to Andy about some old birthday party experiences. They made me laugh, as we have both had quite a few interesting ones. It made me wonder if anyone else looks back at their birthday parties as negatively as I do. I mean it was no one's fault but mine really, I always HAD to have a sleepover with ALL my friends. Even the ones that didn't known each other, or worse...didn't get along with each other. But anyways I always had like 10 people sleep over. And 10 "tween" (this was mostly late elem. school) girls NEVER get along for the whole night.   Not to mention I was a total control freak, and yes I can admit this now. I always made people do what I wanted them to do. This usually meant everyone getting into pajamas at a certain time, (usually when I got into mine, it never really felt like a sleepover party unless everyone had pajamas on when I was litle) getting everthing pre-approved by me, (I remember a certain time when a friend wanted to watch a movie at 2am...well I was tired...that was NOT going to happen), having everyone sleep where I wanted them to sleep, and all in all I didn't like it unless I wasn't the center of attention and I had say over everything. Alright I was a bratty kid at times.  And then there was my sister. (sorry Robin, I love you now but I hated you at my parties) She always messed everything up. Like when I was trying to keep the whole group together at my pool party because not everyone was a good swimmer (we were in the shallow end), but then she comes along and takes half of us into the deep end with her. And then when you gave everyone makeovers and made me look really bad...that was mean Robin. You always stole all my friends away.  And then there was the location issue. I ALWAYS wanted more than anything to have my party at some cool place, like the Ice House or a hotel or something. But no, we always had to have it at the pool because it was the cheapest. Which makes sense to me only now, (I mean paying for 10 people to get into the Ice House isn't cheap, and those hotel parties...come on) Not that I didn't like the pool, but I had a pool party for like 5 years straight. It got old.  And then there were trick candles. Which at my parties meant friends helping me blow them out. Which meant my friends would end up spitting all over my cake. Yes my parents remember this as well...yes Mandy I have proof.  I just find it funny how year after year I continued to have these elaborate sleepover parties where year after year I always ended the party either up in my room crying, sleeping by myself in my bed where everyone else was downstairs, having people be mad at me, or just wanting everyone to leave.   I mean don't get me wrong, I loved birthday parties. They were so fun when you were little. So much preparation would go into them. And the preparation was the fun part: the guest list, the gift bags, the exact plans, etc... I'd start planning months ahead of time. Speaking of gift bags, mine were always the best. (these were very important to me, I was the kid that would sit there and wait until someone gave me my bag before I would even think about leaving the party...never the kid that left theirs) My parents always made sure it was a good time, and I always ended up having fun for the most part. Plus they created lots of memories and pictures which only make me laugh now. And no one ever threw-up...at one of my parties anyway. (I had to put it)  But anyways the approaching birthday always brings back these times. I haven't even thought about having a party. And again by party I'm meaning having a couple friends over. (I did learn my lesson...possibly the reason I've always been anti-party at Sharon's house) But anyways that's where I'm gonna end it. And if anybody has any good birthday ideas, or comments, or funny stories, please do share them with me.
