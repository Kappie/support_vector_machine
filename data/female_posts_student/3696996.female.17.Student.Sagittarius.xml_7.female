I have to go shopping tonight again cuz I lost my ATM card so I couldn't get ne money out last night to buy anything.  I'm wicked pissed off.  Hopefully this week will take my mind off that.  I'm gonna have a lot of fun...that is if Mia's friends don't call me frikin megatron or mohegan or whatever all week.  haha...ooo I just found a real cool calligraphy pen niiiiice....haha ne ways, I'll be back in a week see ya!!!
