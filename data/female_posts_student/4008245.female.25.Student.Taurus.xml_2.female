The actual monetary cost should be minimal due to materials to be used (adhesives), and like wise the design of the logo has already been completed therefore reducing the potential cost even greater. Thus with more funds available to purchase the adhesives, the quantity will be greater, effectively, raising the ability to reach a greater portion of potential clients. Assuming the success of the campaign this will result in a greater market-share in the future.  The ease of implementation will assist in creating a “buzz” among clients needing creative graphic design work preformed.   Congruently, the ease of implementation will allow for decision making to be “on the spot” this includes being able to decide where and how the adhesive will be located and usually accessible. The wide variation of potential advertising sites is a further extension of “implementation” increasing the accessibility for potential clientele.   This project helps to achieve two goals, which are the foundations of frek design:  • To provide the highest quality graphic design while respecting and focusing on the client.  • Engaging the client with this business philosophy introduces the second pillar of frek design, to build long-standing business relationships, not quick business deals.    This project is unique not only because of its marketing and networking strategy but also due to the highly specialized and strategic targeting to the consumer it allows. The stickers will lead clients to the website that will be designed.  The project relies solely on the development of a self-promotional website, the distribution of the stickers and the market analysis that will be performed. The stickers are not permanent, they will be easily removed from any surface.  The cost will total an amount of $15,000.00.  (The actual cost of the stickers will be $100.00.)
