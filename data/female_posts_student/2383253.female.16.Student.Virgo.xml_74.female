On the way back, we spend 3 nights in Paris. I think we're returning on the 18th of August.  I'll bring my cellphone, but I don't think my service is global. Leave me messages, though! :)  For your amusement: http://www.angryalien.com/ (Famous movies re-enacted in 30 seconds by bunnies.)  Erm, I think that's all I have to say. I'll try to post at an Internet cafe. Till that time, bye and I love you.
