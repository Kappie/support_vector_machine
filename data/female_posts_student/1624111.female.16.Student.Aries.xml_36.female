Day 21 - The embryo's body is approximately 1/10 of an inch long. The brain has two lobes. At some point during this week, before the mother's period is one week late, the embryo's heart will begin to beat.  before you even know for sure that youre pregnant...your kid has a heartbeat! now that doesnt count as a living human being? bah...craziness. heartbeats are such a human thing... i dunno man, how do you silence a heartbeat?  **i listened to your heart beat as i held you in my arms**  all i know is, i couldnt do it.
