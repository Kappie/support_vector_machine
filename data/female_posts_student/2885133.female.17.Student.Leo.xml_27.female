I retrieved the targeted DNA from my PCR product but for some reason, after I retrieved the DNA from the gel, there was nearly nothing left. I hope my ligation product will actually be enough to complete the transformation process. Otherwise, the plate will have no bacteria on it... grr!  My muses have deserted me. I can't draw and I can't write. It's driving me insane. So my refuge now is to read... Eragon is rather interesting. I do wonder when the next book is out. The plot is finally standing on its own.  Unfortunately, my last resort of creation is at a dead end. Since I understand nothingness of php whatevers, I cannot find out how to turn on register_globals. It's a security risk, but kind of necessary for the script I found and since I am rather stupid on webbie stuff, I can't modify the code. Oh poo.  Amidst the rest of my personal problems, last night was a party for drunkards as two of them found the area around my house as a lovely resting place. Not feeling very safe at the moment... In addition to everything, I desire a vacation very much. *begging for some time off for some part of my consciousness*
