So now I've got half a day more to do whatever I want to but just don't feel like doing anything worthwhile. Hmmm.. thinking about it, I should in fact be studying( commons comming up very very soon) but just don't feel like it.   Life is very weird don't you think? I mean at the moment I have all the time in the world and I don't want to do anything proper. Later when I won't have the time, I would want to do so many thing.    Humans as a whole are weird creatures. We always what to do things that we can't do, should not do or out of our reach. We always what something that we can't reach or have. We want to discover the unknown when we do not even know the known thoroughly. In a way we follow Lenz's Law- our brain diectly opposes whatever if present in our lives (hahah my physics lecturer will be proud of me :)  )  The Human race should try to be satisfied with what they have and not crave for what they don't. People should develop what they have to satisfy themselves and not just be jealous of others and covet what others have and they don't.  Humans are by far the most amazing and excellent creatures living on Earth but oddly, at the same time they need to learn so much more from other creatures.
