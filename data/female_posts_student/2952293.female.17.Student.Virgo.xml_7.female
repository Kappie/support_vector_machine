There we ran into Margaret, Ann, and Lauren harassing Trisha. They showed us how they were being bullies and it was sooooooo funny. When Margaret left, Ann and Lauren let me try to be a bully. AHHHH! Trisha retaliated against us and held an open water bottle. When we all pushed her, IT GOT EVERYWERE!. And by everywhere, I mean all over ME! But it was really funny and worth it. I'm going to go pick up my pictures! bye bye!
