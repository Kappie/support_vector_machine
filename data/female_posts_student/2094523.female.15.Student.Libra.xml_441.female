So after she left i had a pounding headache which felt like someone was smashing me in the head and my throat hurt like a biznatch and i cudnt swallow or anything with out feeling intense pain. and my nose was stuffed yet runny and i felt so freaking cold.. kinda like u knwo how when you are so cold everything seems to hurt but then when u put on a jacket use a blanket its too damn hot and nothign seems to satisfy you? yea? well that was what it was like and then i was deaf in one ear because it seems that everytime i get sick one of my ears go deaf. So it didnt get better the next morning so here i am feeling really cruddy
