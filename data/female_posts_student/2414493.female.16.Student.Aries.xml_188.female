And orchestra. Oh God. I thought it was getting better but there are moments when you just want to shrink inwardly and implode. I can see it in playing in primitive cinematic effects: one shot shows Lydia playing, sitting on a chair. The next shot shows a poof of smoke and a Cal sweatshirt on the chair.  During Homeland:  Mariah: "Play softer and over the fingerboard. You're the loudest one in the section."  I've analyzed this in my head already. First of all, it's bad since I couldn't hear myself playing, and there's this certain sense of erroneous self-righteousness in playing loud when everyone's soft. Then I have this notion that I'm a horrible player and I don't deserve my chair, and playing horribly and loudly all at once compounds my guilt. And then I need someone to tell me how to play softly. Second, I've made a spectacle of myself. Hank keeps on asking me, first in English and then in Spanish, what she said. I then proceed to think that the crafty critter already knows what she said but wants to make me say it myself to rub salt in the wound. He won't stop asking. Then I wonder if Sean heard it. If he did, that's another nail in the coffin. There's also the risk of her alerting Mr. Benson, or anyone. And finally, it's Mariah (I'm spelling her name wrong on purpose). I haven't liked her ever since the day she was passing out papers and she was right around my stand and I didn't play full volume. She gave me a look, and my memory tells me she said something like, "What, you can't play when I'm around?" And then I asked for Homeland music last week and she in turn questioned, "Second violin?" "No, first," I said. She knows it, too. And then today. I'm fully aware that I'm pathologically hypersensitive, but this kind of discrimination (hatred is too strong, but along those lines) is particularly bothersome since it's indirect. Fine, so if you hate me, tell me right out. And if you don't, don't do anything. But it's hatred by insinuation, and that's what bugs me.  So I, in short, feel like shit.   I almost feel like that group of medieval people that flogged themselves for their sins. What were they called? Something with "flagellate" in the name, since I thought of bacteria when I read about them. But whenever I encounter a situation like this, I become masochistic. In my shame, I seriously wouldn't mind if someone took a knife and slashed me to rid me of my guilt, though I wouldn't take the knife to myself. Instead, I pinch myself or something, just anything to incite physical pain to equal what's inside. Well, I have a sore throat. And maybe staying after school for journalism is also some kind of weird penance. I need to stay. My column might not go in or something like that. I don't know. I thought Bret was joking when he told me that, but what's worse than Bret teasing you is when Bret's serious and won't give.  I think it's lame to sulk. But I'm not going to run around laughing, etc. I'm just embarrased, and overly so, I know, but that's my way of dealing with it.
