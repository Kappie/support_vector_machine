Then, Shawn went to Hardee's for food while I feed Nick and now we are all watching a movie...kind of. I am finishing on the computer, Shawn put a movie in but is in Nick's room talking to Nick. Nick had fallen asleep as soon as we left Pam  Daryl's house last night around 7:30-8 and slept until I gave him 4 ozs at 11 then got up for good at 3:30. I tried to get him to go back to bed but handed him off to Super Dad who stayed up with Nick and attempted everything in the book to get Nick back to bed.  This lasted 2 hours !~While I slept! So those two needed a nap more than I did. Most Sundays we all are running around trying to get this and that done all day, but today, we are staying in! Nick slept on his left side last night yet again.-But he napped on his right. I think that's ok because if he spends all his time on his left, we are going to have a left side problem then. Shawn and Nick did great yesterday! (While I was at work) Those two bond instantly and for the entire Saturday. Next Saturday the three of us are going to Charlie  Amanda's house.
