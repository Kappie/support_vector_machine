I find it deliciously simple to keep track of my files and thoughts online.  And blogging is sort of akin to jotting down notes, but, wait! - look! - like magic, my notes become ordered reverse chronologically.  And, yes (it's too good to be true), they are now readable (as they're not spilled across the pages of multiple pocket-sized notebooks in my schizophrenic scrawl!).    Another reason I blog is that I want some sort of artifact - an active learning document to keep track of my thoughts.  Who knows, there may be an off chance that I would need to retrieve them someday.  Better yet, I don't have to pay to host my thoughts.    I suppose, somewhere in the cobwebby recesses of my mind, I entertained the idea, only for a moment, that I might actually use this silly e-journal to communicate with other people who were interested in similar topics.    I'm not sure that's a main motive.  It would be delightful, but connectivity is not necessary for me in this context.  Some blog for glory, for RSS, for advertising revenue, but not me.  Hmmm... does that make me a prude, then?  Oh right, I was delusional there for a moment, fantasizing that I was popular.  Anyway, you see, I grew up in a small town and have since moved, I believe, 24 times.  'Tis the way of life of a professional student, at least for one who believes you must travel to get a real education, richly experiencing life, savoring exotic tastes and earthy smells.  So, taking into consideration the small town upbringing and the rather apathetic, tight-lipped university where I did my undergrad, somewhere along the way I created this sort of inner life - this constant streaming dialogue with myself (and now I could conceivably be sharing my ramblings with the entire world - strange, eh?).  A lot of people do the same, I mean, lead inner intellectual lives.  No matter how many friends you have, or how head-over-heels in love you are, aren't you alone with your thoughts at the end of the day?  I think the trick is to relish them - to figure out what makes you tick and pursue your inner life with reckless abandon.  And, as a bonus, it's highly unlikely you'll pick up something unsavory, like a std or something, that way.  Life is actually enjoyable when you're content with your person and your thoughts, I think.      Okay, okay... so maybe I started blogging to belong.  Isn't everone else doing it?   P.S.  Strange the words blog and blogging can't be found in blogger's spell check gizmo.
