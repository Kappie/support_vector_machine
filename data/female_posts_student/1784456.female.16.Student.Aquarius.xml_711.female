All ye groupies were out and some one actually tried to talk to me... well their group did. I was like mentally going 'you dare do any thing to me and i swear i will rip your head off and shove it into you cold lifeless body' ...hehe... I think they got it telepathicly. When I walk I look really stressy and walk quickly on purpose - so people will leave me alone... doesn't always work. (Damn) Maybe I should look really happy and skip, then people would definatly leave me alone! Ok, so I guess I am a bit antisocial kind of leave me alone like. Hey, it's not as if people try! I overly do some times and it just ends up in a awkward mess. *shivers* Eugh, note to self: don't freak people out. That's my point in life though! (Freaked huh? Me too!) I love ska. :D It's all happy and jumpy! And makes me go hyper! Trashy pop stuff, bleurgh who needs it? It just goes all trashy and depressing! Nu-uh! Go ska! Okay... bit hyper and mad but hey you don't have to live with me! (I'm going....) Ok, bubi!
