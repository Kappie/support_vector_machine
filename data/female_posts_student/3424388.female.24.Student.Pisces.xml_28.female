But I can't get behind the concept of workplace blogging. I understand that it makes sense for a handful of unique companies, but it does not make sense for the majority of corporations. When it comes to preserving worker knowledge, I tend to think that searchable, categorized databases are much better.  Quintas writes that blogs empower employees. I suppose I had never really thought about corporate blogospheres for all or most employees (though I think personal intranet pages are brilliant!). I think the approach used by Shell Oil Company is more productive ( urlLink see the Business 2.0 article on Shell ).  In 1989, Shell began a private web bulletin board, which cost $1 million     to construct but saves the company an estimated $200 million a year. In a company as large as Shell, it's sometimes difficult to know who to ask for what information, so an informal, company-wide archiving database seemed the way to go.  Shell kept the technology end simple and paid attention to the human relations end of the project. Shell recruited well-respected employees to be the board's initial posters and shepherds, if you will. These employees helped to get the online conversations rolling, which, in turn, gave the board credibility among other employess while giving them a reason to go there. Soon thousands of employees were using the board.        Shell did not categorize the board's topic areas based on rank or location or even strickly on functional area; instead, the company created 12 communities grouped by area of interest. For each category, three moderators were appointed and national promoters were appointed in every country. Soon, Shell employees across disciplines and across the globe were searching for answers on the database, as well as contributing. Shell archives board discussions, thus creating an informal answer database.  I'm not sure how empowered Shell's employees feel each time they use the database. I would imagine not so very, but I'm not sure how much empowerment matters in such a situation. It's liberating and efficient, as employees do not have to find, contact and wait on the Shell employee who possesses the key knowledge.  Employee empowerment is best when it orginates in a different way.  Empowerment, while it can mean access to information, is perhaps more about trust and decision making, at least in the corporate setting. For instance, if a subordinate uses a corporate database to track down an answer, the subordinate will feel utterly powerless if his boss will not allow him to act based upon this new-found knowledge. Empowerment is about pushing decision-making further down the line.  Blogs, too, are a tool of empowerment, but an empowerment of a different kind. I would think that keeping an internal blog on company time is not cost-effective for the vast majority of employees (there are, of course, numerous exceptions). Blogging, however, is a good way to vent. And venting is important, but it can be counterproductive if done in a subversive way (I write this with a company that is a good corporate citizen in mind).  Blogs are more powerful when they are composed by insiders and viewed by outsiders. Take CEOs and politicians that blog; they are empowering their customers, employees and constituents.
