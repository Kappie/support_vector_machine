I loved the free food and drinks.  And well I got to watch a fashion show and a hair style makeover show thing.  It was soooo cool and it was the first time I had ever been to a womens show and now I can't wait for the next one!!!  I also bought myself another charm from my bracelet, it says "dream" on it cause it is to remind me that everyone had to start somewhere and they started with a dream.  I think my mom is getting me a hello kitty charm for Chrismas but yeah that is still a while away.  And well today was actually good.  We saw Mrs. J in the morning and when she smiled and said "hi" that just made my day.  I was all cheerful and happy after that, it was kinda odd but that lady sure has something special about her.  She has this remarkable gift to just cheer people up.  And well I also got Billy to autograph a thing for Chels to and I ever got him to address it to her and she like loved me and gave me a big hug and I have never seen such a hugh smile come over her face.  Me and Chels are usually arguing but today we made peace.  Like I said we were all cheerful and happy today.  I was a little upset about extended TA cause I really needed help with Chem but then I was like about to start crying in chem cause we couldn't go to the lab until we figured out a calculation thing but then Paige came over and helped me with it, told me things would be alright, and told me that if I wanted she could even help me prepare for the quiz.  I think though that I could probably do the quiz really well it is just that I have a hard time with the basic skill of balancing.  That I find very very very hard and also like to write out the equation when it is in a word statement.  I got a 62% on my math test but I think I will use my re-write for the test cause I just have a "feeling" like this is what I should do.  There is like a voice in the back of my mind telling me to re-write it.  At lunch it was also really fun and I got to take my mind away from everything.  We played Crazy Eight's, then Poker, and then we had a few really fun and awesome games of asshole.  Social was like sooooooo boring but Chem well in the lab it was pretty entertaining.  Our chem teacher sat on like one of those stools in the lab and like she broke the chair leg and she was like "whoa" and also feel on her ass.  Oh man that was like the FUNNIEST thing ever, I like could not stop laughing for a good minute.  So yeah things are pretty good for now.  I mean classes are still hard, social is still boring, life right now is great even though I keep eating all the halloween candy and chocolate but I guess I have to live a little.  I have to admit it sure is good!  Well here is a song/poem I wrote about how I WAS feeling, but I think the feeling is slowly passing.  Who knows what is happening this time.  Maybe I am just "adjusting" to this crazy school life.  Hmm only God knows I guess or my heart - or course my heart can't talk, only my consciece can.      What I have to Say  A broken heart, wandering dreams Through the darkness in the latest hours Flames are fading, the colour is erasing Wish I could take this all away  What I am feeling, feeling today More than words could ever say Pain in this heart it can’t be pushed away So you listen to what I have to say  This is today this is today, today, today, today Wandering away wandering away, away, away, away Thinking of death, just one choice, the choice of suicide Have no clue where these thoughts in my heart reside  This is today this is today, today, today, today Wandering away wandering away, away, away, away Looking at her looking at my future world that I want to discover Thinking how she could only be a true light and a hope to me  This is today this is today, today, today, today Wandering away wandering away, away, away, away No one just knows the thought it my head They truly are the ones I dread  This is today this is today, today, today, today Wandering away wandering away, away, away, away Wish I could talk and I wish I could share But sometimes I don’t know who would really care  This is today this is today, today, today, today Wandering away wandering away, away, away, away Thinking what if my dreams don’t come true I wish, I wish, I wish I only knew  A broken heart, wandering dreams Through the darkness in the latest hours Flames are fading, the colour is erasing Wish I could take this all away  What I am feeling, feeling today More than words could ever say Pain in this heart it can’t be pushed away So you listen to what I have to say  ~Vanessa
