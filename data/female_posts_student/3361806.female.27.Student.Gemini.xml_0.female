I decide to start typing some report but since we have to use Latex format. so, I have to learn how to use these tools (life is full of learning .. ha ha)  Cause i'm still windows user. I have to do it in the windows way.  1. install cygwin 2. install xemacs  this link is very useful for learning how to install and make it work!  urlLink http://home.imf.au.dk/hellmund/xemacs.html   Now, i'm trying to use latex.
