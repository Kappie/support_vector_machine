It was incredible. The tape is really intense too, sorta. Not as good as when I was there. And the MOSH PIT. GOOD GOD. Short and sweet, some guy's mouth exploded where he got hit. Poor sucker, I salute him. And the stage, I was doing lil' jumps and trampolining off of it, I was sure it was gonna break; but no, it'll be ready for next year.  I sent some more invites, I wonder if they got through.
