The only people I have to talk to are Clarke (fun, huh?) and Rebekkah (I luv u Beks!).   I got a letter from Aquinas about a week ago giving me the rundown on all I really need to know. I got basically everything except...my schedule. I am getting extremely ticked off because that's the most important thing to me. I would really not rather be walking around in the hallways not knowing what classes I have to go to. *roll eyes*   But...I got my uniform requirements. Hoo boy. They're really not that bad, but it's going to be a big change. Basically, it's just like a plain white, yellow, or light blue button down shirt, and brown, black, or tan pants. But--we have to have one regualtion skirt. They're actually ::kinda:: cute...Even though I really hate plaid. But, I'm definitely NOT getting a pleated skirt--I HATE pleats! I'm getting a "four-gore kilt". It's not too bad--it's just kinda like four pleats in the front and the back is flat. Um, everything else isn't really that bad. But the shoes can't be taller that 2 inches! That is SO wrong!!! I love heels!! 2 inches is NOT tall enough! ;_;  I also got my summer reading assignment. Wow, CCDS really overworked us with summer reading. I only have to read 1 book! 1, count 'em, 1 book! Yay! It's called Parrot In The Oven and it's by Victor Martinez. I still haven't gotten it yet because the library didn't have any copies and I don't feel like buying it from Borders. The school was even so kind as to reserve copies for us Freshman at Borders. How sweet, huh?  So, yah, I'm really excited for high school. Um...I'm actually starting to get kinda nervous.  I am so bored that I am actually holding somewhat of a conversation with Clarke. And I was the one who started it. Omg, I must be losing my sanity...
