Usually, we find ourselves feeling incredibly guilty for spending hours (if not days) on end doing nothing more than showering and eating during a day's passing.  But now that we're forced to do just that because of the several feet of snow in the driveway and the continually non-plowed streets of town.  Soon we may have to start eating each other to survive.  That'll show 'em who's boss.  Made it out to see Cold Mountain yesterday then spent the evening finishing the last 100 pages of the book.  Think I'll have to see it again before I deliver my final verdict.  Overall, I really enjoyed the movie, but the book will always have my heart.  The three main characters translated beautifully to screen, but the remaining supporting roles were trimmed significantly to fit the movie, which left me a bit miffed.  The gals shared a kiss, though, and we love that, Civil War be damned!  Today's only possible outing will be to dinner with Levi's aunt and uncle.  Yay.  They're good people.  Plus they have a hot tub.  Spent a while at their place the afternoon leading up to the night of gay dancing glory.  His aunt's a bigger, brasher, funnier-in-a-different-way version of his mom.  Good damn times.  So mexican food and margaritas with them sounds like a good excuse to risk our lives on the streets of this frozen city.    The boy says I should write about how much fun we're having.  We're having so much fun.  I'm starting to dread his leaving a wee bit.  But if the weather keeps up this shit, he won't be able to leave and he will be mine.  He will be my squishy.  That's my teapot's name, by the way.  Got it for my birthday, so excited.  No more of the microwaved brew for me!  Received my first lawyer-to-be power suit, too.  It's so intimidating, I'm even scared to put it on.  But I'm supposed to be telling you about all the frolicking we've been doing, sorry!    We've been doing Yoga like no other!    "Let's just do some stretches."   "Okay!"   Cut to an hour later.    "And this is where you put your hand on the sky and lift your ankle across the room to the mirror before breathing out of your ear!  Let's go!  Two on each side!  Remember to breathe and lift up through the heart!  Change the CD while you're over there, will you?"    We're so limber.    Listening to the Madonna mix now, remembering the other night at Charley's, missing Seattle, and loving being forced to relax.
