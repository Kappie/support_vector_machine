She hates my guts and basically i'm not to say anything about her agian behind her back. he said the said thing. I'm also not to "flirt" with matt...so no talking to him. But that isn't going to happen...i'm not giving up our friendship. guys i need help...really just if i break down tomorrow hide me from everyone please.
