How can I write anything worth reading if I know someone will actually read it? Anyway I've escaped long enough to write an update, cuz if I don't write now I just might explode later.  I like AJ. Complete honesty in this journal, if I put that in the other one he'd end up reading it one day or some one else would be like.... ew she's a child molester or somethin. I can't spell molester. :/ Anyway I can't help it - I do like him, I mean, I think he's awesome and I love spending time with him. Really I'd love to spend more time with him no matter what level it's on. But I'm also catching a bit of spring fever here at the end of summer, so it's hard to be around him and not overflow with emotion.  It's also incredibly annoying for me to be so not in control of the moment.  Two years ago it would not have been a problem. But then, that was when my life was all about falling in love and raising happy little kids and spreading happiness everywhere.  Those things are still important to me, but in a much more realistic way.  After my break up with Coozer at the beginning of sophomore year, I wanted alone time, really for the first time.  But then I got so used to my own independence, that when Sam came along, I couldn't committ. There were a lot of issues that factored in to the failure of that relationship, but a big problem was that it was my first serious relationship. When I say serious, I mean that I grew a brain. For the first time I wasn't drueling over some picture perfect imaginary future or falling for lines old as time. He wasn't asking me to. But since I wasn't doing my usual naive cartwheels of joy, I knew something was missing. I couldn't adjust despite my own desires to. I wasn't happy cuz i was so busy thinking about what was wrong or would go wrong yatta yatta. I refused to let myself trust the relationship or any possible future. So that ended and I spent more time alone, and happy to be so, might I add.  Untill now anyways.  Now i'm alone and I don't want to be. I can be, I'm not afraid to be. I mean, couple events make me lonely kind of, but having a bf isn't gonna make me enjoy the concept of hanging with multiple friends and ignoring all but one.  I don't like couple things.  It's more the thought of having someone close to me.  All my best friends have their own partners to spend 24/7 with and tell all their secrets to.  I'd be happy with a best friend, I mean, I have that in Mandy some, but even there boys have taken over a few of my duties. so yeah, that's life i guess. Anyway I could deal with it, it's not like i just went eanie meanie miny mo, and picked a crush. The aj thing just kinda happened. And it's far from head over heals, I don't know how to explain it.  It just bugs me cuz I didn't decide it was time for it to happen or that he would be a logical person for me to like. I really don't know him at all. It's lame. Completely. But I'm around him and I feel like a middle school kid. I want to just tell him, take action of some sort and put myself in controll somehow. I feel like even screwing up and being disapointed would be better than complete helpless ignorance. Espescially watching Becca talk to him. She's awesome and really would be way better for him, if they're more than friends, which I wouldn't know, cuz I danno him! AH. But it's too early for me to say anything to him. One day, I'll explain all this, some how. If he's not taken by then heh. I'm just frustrated. I hate talking to him and wondering if maybe tara told him, even tho she said charlotte was on crack about the matchmaking thing. Or maybe he can just tell.  I hate talking to him and being giddy instead of focussing on friendship. I feel like I'm cheating both of us, in the same way that i used to handle my relationships. Bleh. Impatience.  In a kind of related note, I've been full of energy lately. Even something as simple as breathing is awesome, it's like i'm thirsty for air. I wanna be pretty, but more importantly I wanna be dancing, all the time. Music is bursting out of me. That's the only way I know how to explain it, I don't know if it makes any sense at all to anyone else. Anyway, I don't think that relates to aj, at least, aj doesn't cause that happiness, but it could be that happiness that causes my feelings for him. Who knows. I hate not knowing.  I do want a slow dance tho, with him. AHHHHHHHHHHHh. Ima have to tell him.  dang this drives me mad. toodles.
