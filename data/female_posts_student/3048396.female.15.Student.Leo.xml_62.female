Yeah today was pretty stupid...cuz we had like 20 minute classes...pretty pointless...all we did was sign out n turn books in and crap like that. It was just...grand. We finished Finding Nemo in Spanish...Science we started bubbles filled with methane on fire. Omg it was soo awesome! It was like on the celing but not starting it on fire. Some pretty fun stuff. Very cool. Fire is awesome. Then Algebra...dumb...Im so glad thats over. I will not miss it. Then we had 45 minutes of homeroom cuz we had to clean lockers n stuff. Then we could leave. Mr. DeGroot was being stupid and we had to do dumb stuff...but oh well...We lived. Then Tracy n Jimmy gave me a ride home and I was feeling pretty good...Until I found out I didnt have a computer. Oh I was mad. All it would do was boot up in safe mode. What a piece! Gur. So then I went to the park to Mayu's going away party. It was really alot of fun. Ashley, Becky, Marie, Amber, Amber, Kali, Lexie, Mayu and I were there. Small croud but alot of fun. We had water ballon fights...we all ended up getting soaked....Beckys step dad jesse got all of us...Eh. But yeah. I got this really cool fan from her. Its all fun. Im really gonna miss Mayu. She was a great friend. Love her to death. So the ending was sad...I got tons and tons of hugs from her. *sigh* She was crying...I held it back for awhile. It was sad. So yeah. Then I came home and taned for awhile. I have a tan line! Woo! :D Hopefully I'll get some more sun soon. I love sun. So yeah. Right now Im at my Grandmas using her computer while shes out to eat with friends. Thank God I could get to a computer. I was going nutts at home. I felt so lost lol. Sad huh? LoL. So I guess thats all for now....  Tara   Current Music:  Naughty Girl by Beyonce  Current Mood:  Happy  Quote of the Day:  "Im gonna miss you soo much Tara!!" - Mayu
