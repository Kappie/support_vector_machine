'Cos that's the only time I can get us a ride home. Mom's busy after that so yeah. Meh, Nima's leaving at 5 anyway.   To be honest, I don't like Nikki too much. Her and Tara are coming to Wonderland with us. I don't have a problem with Tara but I just don't like Nikki too much. Her PERSIAN PRIDE and loud Persian speaking is really annoying. She was talking about Ioana in Persian so loudly its not even funny. Whatever. I'm probably crabby since I just woke up.  Bethel last night was soo much fun! I picked up Jo and we went to Bethel. Murder Mystery Night. We interviewed different people and basically just had fun! Robbie's group got it right. Haha! Angie was the secretary, Brian was the lawyer, Steve was the brother of Mr. Stone, Amy's friend was Mrs. Stone, and the funny dude was the janitor. Hilarious guy pretending to be janitor. His accent was soo funny! Hehe! So yeah. Next week is Media discussion. I like those~ The one after that is BBQ and Games! Yay~!  Well, I should go wash up and eat. Blog later...? Maybe. I'm off.
