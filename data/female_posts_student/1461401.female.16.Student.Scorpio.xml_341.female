(and for all of those who have not seen it, and yes, this includes my french teacher, you deserve to be shot in the foot) Yay for clean room and clean starts and clean consciences!  ...well... almost. Alex, what happened to you today? You said you would come over, but you didn't even call. I was actually kind of looking forward to katie meeting you... and I have that cd you wanted...   But yes, overall, very good day indeed. (...well... almost.)
