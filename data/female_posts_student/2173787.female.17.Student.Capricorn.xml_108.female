My mind is clear and I feel ready to do something, so I think I'll iron and put ribbon on my new curtains before I go to bed.  My face has color again and my eyes look less bloodshot and I have no voice.  I was in such a great mood on the way home that I lost it (my voice).  I rode home in a tank top with the windows down, sunroof open and the heat and stereo all the way up, with me singing along of course.  Since I wrote this entry in my head before I got home, I'm going to pretend that I didn't hear the conversation downstairs when my dad got home and instead go back to my sewing.
