My dear dear reply me hahaha in a lousy paper.But at least she did reply me.Today all the lesson are a horror to me,we got to go here and there.ANd in the end,someone lost her way.Can't believe it! Let me clarify something, Sheila and I are both innocent ok,nth happens.I can't wait to see Ying min and Sheila break up.Hahaha... Sheila say i am not concern abt my dear dear,but then does it concern abt her.She is so KPO!!! Hahah.. i know that i sounds mean here but i am just joking. My bus bell didnt come to school today,i heard her mum say she was having fever the past few days,and her fever was like 'on' and 'off'. I hope she is ok cos i kinda miss her. (She) had broken up with her boyfriend and it is like becos of his 'O' level. I dun think that is a good reason anyway i dun care cos i am washing my hands off her business.The whole school stay back today to practice the FUSION DANCE,i think that is a disaster. Today i feel very tired i wish to sleep forever.
