I am finally done with driver's ed. well, not officially, since I have to go tomorrow and get my completion certificate. but I took my final test today and passed! even though I'm not sure if I have a must drive to get my permit, I don't think I did. yay!!!! although this also brings to light the fact that june is over. went sooo fast. I'm gonna be back in school before I know it! yuck. oh well.  I am soooo sick of hearing and seeing all this weight and dieting crap. all you see anymore is sticks on tv followed by dieting ads. it's all over. and then you hear about mary-kate olsen being anorexic. it's so depressing everyone thinks you have to be super-skinny. *screams in frustration*  I leave for vacation tomorrow. I'm not sure how accesible net lines will be, so I'll just have to wait and see. my major goal for this vacation is taking pictures. I always take pictures, I know, but I never take pics of stuff we do. I always take pics of, you know, artsy stuff.   I am so dreading packing. I am HORRIBLE at it. seriously. it's gonna take forever. bye then.
