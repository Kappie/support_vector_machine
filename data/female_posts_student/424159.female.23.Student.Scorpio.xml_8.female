History is ok, kinda fun to be able to express your knowledge and opinions in discussion.  Fortunately, this quarter is over in a week.  The spring will bring more Physics, Hebrew 101, and a First Aid class my way.  It won't be so bad, because, some summer, I not going to OSU.  I'm talking a X-Ray class at Columbus State.    Fun.
