I could of just laid in his arms and never of left. I seriously could not stop crying, I hate saying goodbye. I know we only have to wait 5 weeks to see each other again, but still...it's 35 days without seeing his sweet smile everyday or having his arms around me. I'm going to miss laying beside him at night, waking up in the middle of the night, seeing his cute face, knowing how much he cares for me. I know I can spend the rest of my life like this. People can say I'm too young to know what love is, or too naive. But, I've never been so sure about anything before in my entire life. I know my love is true and I know it's going to last a lifetime. So even though it might be goodbye for now, I can see in the distance future a time when we'll always be together.   What's meant to be will always find away She's going to marry that boy someday
