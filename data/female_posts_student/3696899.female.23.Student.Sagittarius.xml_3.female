I can not say that we have always been this close, but we even went to elementary school together.  We grew closer as the years grew, I dont know what I would have done without her.  She is the person I go to when I am have trouble, I go to her for everything and she has a way of calming me down with anything.  Mandy has been there for me the whole time my dad has been in and out of the hospital, which he is in again.  She has been my support and a best friend whenever you need her.  And of course she has the two cutiest kids in the whole world, behind Jacob of course, who I hope love me as much as I love them.  I do try and spoil them when I go to see them.  I love you guys so much.  Well one last thing to say and that is get the POPPYCOCK ready Ill be there soon.  Talk to ya later.
