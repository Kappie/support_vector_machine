O__O)… Then we fly back like the 17th… Maze day is on the 18, probably flying out THAT NIGHT to San Diego (BOGGIE BOARDING! I haven’t gone in so long…) or Las Vegas. We have to go to an OSH ROBAN concert on the 21st and catch a flight back on the 22st or else end up driving all the way back home so we can get to school on the 23rd.  Yep… I KNOW!  No time to rest at all. Still need to get my last beyond book (and finish reading F451). Talk about crazy. And we were thinking about going to Europe… Jeezuz….  I am dreading school. Mom and Dad are going to have to give me Benadril just so I’ll go to sleep the night before. Which reminds me. Lately, I haven’t been able to sleep very soundly… Insomnia? Stress? I dunno. I mean… it’s too early for me to start stressing out about school (even for me).  For example, last night. I woke up every hour (after having very odd dreams… And I normally don’t have dreams… So why am I starting to have dreams now?). Mom woke me up at 8 telling me they were going to have breakfast at Antie Joy’s. Then dad comes in at 10 and says he’s leaving for my Aunts house. So I wake up every hour as usual and finally get out of bed at 1 something. Go on the computer, call Gina… Mom and dad come pick me up half and hour later to have lunch at my Aunt’s house. The Lilliputians left, they’re heading to David’s house.  And tomorrow, we have to go to a funeral. My Uncle whose been sick for a while finally died. Ryan’s still really uncomfortable with death. He’s still really emotional from Mr. Alfalma. So going up to Sacramento tomorrow…  And that’s my life so far. It’s been crazy and it’s only going to get crazier.  Where did summer go?
