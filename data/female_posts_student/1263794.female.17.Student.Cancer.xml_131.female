Anyways...LIGHT STARBUCKS FRAPUCCINO'S! What the hell!! You can't alter a frapuccino! That is WRONG. All this weight watching crap out there is really starting to piss me off, and I'm gonna laugh when Mandy is right and all of you carb-counting, yogurt for breakfast eating, being skinny obsessors DISAPPEAR. Why can't you just excercise and lay off the doughnuts when needed? Don't make America change everything to cater to your weight problem. I mean McDonald's has heart monitors in their Happy Meals now. What is that?  Now it's not that I'm against restaurants and fast food places serving healthier foods, but it just seems like they're the ones getting blamed for America's obesity crisis. When it's comes down to it, it's not the restaurant's fault for serving the food, it's the customer's fault for stuffing themselves with it.  Everytime I see someone with a Starbucks LIGHT Frapuccino, I will laugh. Because it is dumb. It's not hard to do a couple more sit-ups at night. What's the point of getting one anyways, there's no whipped cream, and EVERYONE knows that's the best part.  Maybe when I'm a little older, with a really slow metabolism, maybe then will I pay attention to all this carb counting crap and appreciate things like Light Starbucks Frappucino's, but until then, I like my french fries and frapuccinos just the way they are.     And light up shoes for teenagers...DEFINITELY something America needs.
