I have been living in a few exciting moments this past week. Just this last weekend, I decided to drive back to Seattle again for a last minute blast with my friends. I finally got my hair done, some say I look more korean and some say Japanese... hahaha can't say I don't like any of the comments... Did some heavy cosmetic shopping at Nordstrom, almost bought the entire line from Stila cosmetics recommended by Ramon who was my make-up artist at that time. He did a stunning job on me and I couldn't resist for not going out partying that night. Ok enough of self complement. But I did had an excellent time on Saturday night. Had a few drinks and danced the night away at a club call Medusa in downtown Seattle. We were all kind of trash that night, but couldn't stop laughing. I have to say that weekend thanks to all the Indos I have met especially Bimo, my good girlfriend Bow from Thailand, where can I ever find such two wonderful friends?! Also not forgetting Sharon the Tsing Tao girl....crazy lass indeed, never seen anyone so wild! hahahah. Glad to have met her.    Anyways on Monday, Travis has asked me if I would like to go gliding....and I am like Yeah...lets go, without knowing what it actually was about.  Alright when we got there, obviously a glider is just a plane without an engine and in order to get a lift up, needs a tow plane to pull it up into the sky. I thought it was fun but I wish I wasn't so  quizzy. nah I did not puke...if the pilot did some extreme dives...I probably would. But told him not to as I am not that use to flying like this.  So yeah, here's a picture below, pretending that i am ok...hahaha and for more detail story, check out  urlLink Travis'blog .
