Apart from they didn't, they just sang "Love, love, love" about fifteen million times and if I her it one more time then I think I might shoot myself! (Don't get any ideas people!) Did you know that the rock concert was broadcast to thirty countries and twenty million people watched it! It was soooo good! (Well, the old fogies were!) Oh, and whooooopie! S Club 7 are apparantly splitting up! (So there is a god after all!...) Haha, as you can see I'm very upset about that. ;) ;) ;) And every one should check this out  urlLink http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=eccentricity%20  Hmm... now does that word remind you of any thing or any one? Hey! Stop looking at me!!! Another weird thing that we became obsessed with in Spanish is this website:  urlLink http://www.hotelparquesur.com/  Of course we didn't learn any thing, but hey it's fun and oooooh! IT HAS A VIRTUAL TOUR! Yeay! Oh but it's got this freaky sign thingy if you look all the way down! Have fun looking around the rooms guys! (Maybe I shouldn't of said that...)
