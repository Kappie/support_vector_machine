What's funny, is that my grades haven't really suffered at all.  >=) I've done all my work in other classes... and I'm slipping by juuuust fine.  Maybe I should stop. Or not.  Yesterday I walk into driver's ed and Mr. Potoker says VERY loudly, "Even Ashleigh Allen does!"  Which prompts a "What do I do??!?!?!?!" him: "Oh. I just said that even you thrive under pressure on tests."   bwahahahaha.  definitely gotten B+s/As on his tests even though I sleep allllll the time :)  It was so great...  In math the other day I was pulling what I thought was a loose string off my red shirt... And Andrew Yang looks at it and goes, "But your shirt isn't white!!!! I don't get it!!!" in his silly Andrew Yang kinda voice right?  hehehe. Think about it.  Then he got all grossed out and talked about how I needed to duct-tape my bra together so it didn't come off.   Oh boy... Time to redo my chipped nails
