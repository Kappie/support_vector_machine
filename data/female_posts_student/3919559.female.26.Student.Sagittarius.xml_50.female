I got to meet Carl Schnee from Delaware and two of his friends, who were in town, for a hike up to Crystal Lake.  On Sunday, we hung out around the house, doing laundry and cleaning up and catching up.  For me, it was a little boring.  Or maybe it's just because I'm a doggie-teenager that I act up.  But my mommy sure seems to be yelling at me a lot and shaking that can whenever I jump or eat out of Cassidy's dish (isn't it my food, too?) or bark or pull ahead on the leash.  I'm sure trying, but it's tough being a puppy and a good one at that.    We went for a good walk on Sunday night in the neighborhood and up to the water tank.  We also got to play some fetch before it got too dark.  I've figured out that those black plastic things sticking up out of the grass are good for a quick and cool drink when I stick my mouth over them.  It stings a little, but it's worth it while we're out on a walk.  Love, Caesar
