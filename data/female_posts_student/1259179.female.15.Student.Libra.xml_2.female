They and we, talked about everything from what we we're going to wear to what time our parents would let us stay out till.... Well, let me bring you back to mine.,   I graduated high school in 1981. My prom date was a nice guy named Tony, who later on became my first husband. I went looking for the perfect dress that we said "Jazz Ballet Dancer " So none of that long draby dress or even the ones that looked like lampshade covers, because you knew that one day, you we're sure to actually HAVE to wear those, because your cousin that had no taste, would make you and 6 other bridesmaids wear IT with matching apple green shoesa and umbrella.   So back to my prom, I finally found a knee lenght chiffon, little strap number in the worst color anyone with blond hair can wear, BEIGE. It really like the fact that it was different. That morning, I went to the hairdresser and had a wrap-around french-braid doo. But the piece of residence, I bought real dancers shoes They cost me more then the dress and the doo combined. Now to complete the ensemble, my corsage was a yellow carnation.   We all know that matching outfits we're in then, so my date could be dressed in a BROWN TUXEDO with really shinny brown plastic shoes. Boy we made quite a couple.   We left in his sister's brown 77 Civic Honda that actually matched us..... went to KONTIKI'S for the traditional graduation drink, a green volcanic drink that just looked good and tasted like kool-aid, but it was the place to go then.   The rest of the evening went off very well, my date didn't speak to anyone since I went to french school and he didn't speak french....made the night a little long.   But to wrap it up, no limo's, no heavy drinking, no overnight bars, but I stay filled with great memories of my school years.   I still have my corsage, the shoes and dress are long gone, so is the prom date for that matter.... but I still get excited over anyones PROM night.   Have a great Saturday evening and......Be good
