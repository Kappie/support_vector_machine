And dad talked to justin about airplane tickets...hehe this might actually work. Justin and Courtney might fly down here and stay for a few days then i'll fly back up with them. Then after a week or so i'll fly back on my own. Scary. After seeing Day after tomarrow..im alil hesitant on flying...turbulance..the wonders. But oh well. I just hope to God....ok maybe not god I just hope everything goes well. I even did a reading on myself and my card said that im like...really wanting success, and that i hate the delays. DUH!!!!! I was alil disapointed with the results lol. Right now im watching LAst Comic Standing and im not very impressed. They're just not making me laugh and i like to watch funny things on tv...other than dramas(hehe)...but c'mon..stop with the Arnold S. impressions. and the M.J. jokes ppl! I'm waiting for the phone to ring...pathetic i know but hey, its life, its my life....not all that great right now, come to think of it, its never all that great. But it must be the same story for alot of other ppl too i know. *sigh*...Francesca u lil whore lol...and i know what you were thinking while talking to that guy...oooh *boy with the sexy hair uh OH* LMAO haha.
