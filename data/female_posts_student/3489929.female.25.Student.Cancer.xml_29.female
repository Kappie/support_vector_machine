And even though I have not spoken to this girl in almost five years, I am glad for her. But it made me think- why have so many of my past friendships been so easily disposable?    The thing is, I broke off contact with all but one (Lisa) of my high school friends back in '99. My reason for that was a fight I had with one of my friends, who turned out not be such a good friend after all. And because she was closer to everyone who was in our little circle of pals from high school (they all went to UA together), I just stopped talking to everyone so I wouldn't have to deal with this particular girl again. No big loss, it turned out- no one ever tried to see why I stopped coming around, and I am sure they heard plenty from my ex-friend.    The bride-elect I mentioned earlier had been a friend of mine since the 8th grade. We had an on-again, off-again friendship throughout high school, which was on again our senior year. But the funny thing was, it was never really a friendship in the way a friendship should be. It was always me making plans, me calling her, me going to see her... never the other way around. There was no reciprocation on her part, or if there was, it was half-hearted at best. But I liked hanging out with her, and we had some good times. In the back of my mind, I always felt she didn't value our friendship like I did. But Istuck around, because I was reluctant to forget someone I had known for so long. You'll stick with anything long enough if you know there's security and continuity there.    The last time I saw her was the summer of '99. The ex-friend and I went to her house and stayed up all night watching scary movies with her boyfriend at the time (who I think is the guy she is marrying [same name], and if he is, then way to go).    I have good memories of times we spent together. I remember us going to Tannehill on a field trip with another friend of ours, and out of nowhere, we just decided to climb a "mountain" (a really, really steep, rocky hill, probably about40-50 feet high). None of us were athletic by any stretch of the imagination. We were slipping and sliding and laughing our asses off, and just having fun. We helped each other, and all three of us made it up that damn mountain. And we did it again the next year, just to prove we could.    I remember eating lunch with her every day for four years- we always had the same lunch period. I remember mediating between her and another girl when they both fell for the same guy senior year. I remember sharing crushes on various guys, after-school job horror stories, and college application nightmares.    I remember the bad times. We fought, like clockwork, once a year for several weeks at a time. We wouldn't speak, wouldn't even look at each other. But we always made up, and I'd like to think that we finally  grew  up, when we made it through our entire senior year without issue.    I'm glad that she seems to have found her happiness. I'm jealous that I still have not found my own. I'm sad I don't know her now. All I know about her life right now is what fits in a wedding announcement in the Sunday paper. I'm sorry I never kept in touch. I wish I knew her now, to see what she's like, and to see if we would still be friends after all these years. Probably not. ButI still wonder.    The thing is, even if I could go back and change things, I don't think I would. Everything that has happened to me has happened for a reason. It's changed me, it's made me grow, it's given me purpose. I am a different person than I was five years ago. And I will continue to grow, and I'll be a different person when I see her at the reunion in three years.    I am finally starting to accept the person that I have become. I am starting to like myself. I am intelligent. I am funny- in a really goofy, kinda stupid way. I am creative. I am unpredictable. I'm loud, I'm emotional, I'm bitchy, I'm temperamental, I'm thoughtful. I am a mental depository of useless, trivial knowledge that makes me a  Jeopardy!  ace. I'm always learning andI'm curious about everything (some people would call that "nosiness"). I am not afraid to state my opinion. Iwill fight for what I want. I like to take care of people. I give the best head rubs in the galaxy. I am, potentially, a GREAT human being.    I have a good family thatloves me- even though it sometimes may not feel that way, I know they will be there for me if dire need ever arose. I have the best friend in the entire universe, who doesn't even  know  how great she is- she's like ten of everybody else. She showed me what real friendship is. And I have a really decent job for now, something that will provide for me, and a boss who most of the time treats me like family and makes sure that I am taken care of as long as I am taking care of his company.    Of course, there are things about myself I don't like. But I am always trying, and I am always working on myself. Maybe I have a rose-colored view of myself at this point. Maybe I am just seeing what I want to see. But when I catalog my good points to myself, they far outweigh the bad. That means I am on the right track. I know myself better than anyone, and I also know better than anyone else what my weak points are and how to improve them.    It's funny how something so innocuous as a wedding announcement can send your mind hurtling back through time to relive your memories and reevaluate yourself. But... it's a rainy Sunday afternoon, and it's a perfect time to be reflecting on my past.    Now it's time to focus on my future.
