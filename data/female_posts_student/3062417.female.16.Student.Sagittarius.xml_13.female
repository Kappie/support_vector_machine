Then I went home and worked on my English project until 11.  Tuesday- Didn't go to school un 10. Found out I got a 95 on my math 30 week (thanks carol). Then after school I came home and Carol got off the bus at my house and we just hung out until 9. Then I watched One Tree Hill.   Today- School was okish. I got a 79 in math (yay). I thought I was gonna fail. And I got a 92 in chem and an 83 in english. Danielle and I went to the "get together" in della posta's room and we hung out w/ kim, ned, kevin, bean, and matt. "Why don't you pull ur pants down kim?"-Kevin. It was some fun times. Then I came home and got online. Now I'm talking to Dan and listening to The Early November.  Song:  I got a day and a reason Why I should not believe in Anything, anymore What's this for  My time well spent   I've got all these memories That I cannot believe in 'Cause I don't know Where I've been All these years  All these years  And do you know this reason I hope that you can see it 'Cause I will not give up and We all know what you've done again I can see right through you You're making your way over again Again  Two days after leaving  And I don't have a reason To keep you from being here But I don't steer These thoughts away  I know that you know this But I could never get you To believe all my fears Is this your clear?  I think so  Again, again Again  -"Dinner At The Money Table"-The Early November
