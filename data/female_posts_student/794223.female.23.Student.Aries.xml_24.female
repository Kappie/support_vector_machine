Oceanography is done, the grade is being processed as we speak in admissions.  Everything seemed to be going well, until the advisor noticed that, apparently within the last few weeks, UT randomly changed the geology requirements, and now the ACC Oceanography course I took is under 'Marine Sciences'.  It WAS GEOL 307, now it's MS something or another.  Why the hell would they change a course mid-semester?  Furthermore, now the Liberal Arts advisor has to go through and do YET ANOTHER over-ride for my degree b/c PEOPLE AT UT DON'T COMMUNICATE WITH ME.    Then, after I finally filled out the form to officially graduate, she said that they couldn't change the program, b/c it had already been sent off to be printed out.  So...the graduation program will have a little * by my name that says I'm walking, not graduating.  I AM GRADUATING.  I will have a degree that says I graduated in December, the Fall of 2003.  Which in the grand scheme of things, is all that matters I suppose.  Still...why didn't these people tell me this earlier?!  I would have gotten the ACC course finished even sooner had I known that the graduation programs had to be sent out for printing last week.    So.  Note to everyone out there who gives a damn: I am graduating, regardless of what the program says.  In 3 years, with University and Departmental Honors, I might add.  Take THAT stupid UT bureaucracy...and Westlake High School.  I made it in spite of you.
