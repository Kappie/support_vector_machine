So far today I slept in until 1, got up, ate, talkled to Bruce, re-read some Harry Potter stuff, surfed the web, laid around some more, and now I'm contemplating maybe getting dressed and going to walmart or something.   I added a  urlLink links  page to my website last night, but it's still in the works. Also, as you can see, you now have the ability to comment so that I know someone might actually be reading this drivel! Happy blogging!
