Except for the fact that she wanted to go home and she was ready! which I really understand Because I bet she wanted time alone and I always do soo its understandable! Im soo happy that she got to makeout with nate before she went though! Well today me and Rachel and Jenny met nate at pierce collage and we just hung out and talked! And we also watched Uptown girls! how cool? lol! well thats what we did! bye bye.     ~amanda~
