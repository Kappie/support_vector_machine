The other response is the way I see it--Christ giving his life, freely, for humanity.    From Matthew 26:53, when Jesus calls upon Peter to put down his sword:  "Do you think I cannot call upon my Father, and He will at once put at my disposal more than 12 legions of angels?  But how then would the scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen this way?"  I did walk out of that movie a stronger Christian; it truly solidified my faith.  I do not hate the Jews or the Romans for crucifying Jesus, because Christ was not killed; he gave his life freely, knowing his fate and how brutal his death would be.  It doesn't matter who nailed him to the Cross--whether it be the Jews, the Romans, the Egyptians...it doesn't matter.  This debate, while certainly worthwhile, deeply saddens me because we're missing the entire point.  You are right--the movie was about his death.  There have been many films made about his life, but this film was made to illustrate not the hatred surrounding those who crucified Him, but Christ's ultimate sacrifice.  God's sacrifice.  Our Heavenly Father knew what had to be done, though in human form he also knew how brutal this death would be.  But He could have not taken the cup that contained His fate; He could have just as easily stopped the soldiers from arresting him, or called upon thousands of angels to come to earth to avenge his suffering.  But He didn't, because he knew what it would take to save humanity.  This film was very difficult to watch, because of the brutality.  But as I watched the Romans ruthlessly whipping his flesh apart, did I hate them?  Did I hate the mob encouraging His death?  No, because all of this had to come to pass.  And clearly one saw that those who were mocking him, beating him, and seeming all the while to enjoy it...you also saw Satan, weaving his way through the crowd.  Do not think that those bringing about the Lord's death were acting simply of their own accord, for the devil wanted nothing more than to torment God enough to the point that He would give in and not fulfill His plan.  Thankfully, He did not give in.  If I were, for a moment, to think about whichever group actually brought about His death, it would be idiotic to assume that those same group of people are the same as those today.  But I don't because it's futile; it's not one group or sect who 'killed' Him.  Technically, it was humanity as a whole through sin.  But since God willingly got up on the Cross, He took sin onto himself so that it may be washed from us.  "Little about the good that he has done - just the bad that was done through his death..."  But you see, that's just it; there was no bad that was done through His death.  Nothing but good came out of that.  While God suffered more than any human has or ever will on this earth, what He (and we) gained out of that suffering is incomparable.  'When at last you understand The grace by death He gave to us All else shade fade All else returns to dust'
