As I had just read that babies can only see approximately 20/400when they are first born, and I happen to be the proud owner of one 20/400 eyeball, I thought that there is no way an infant could respond visually to anything at that point in their lives. Apparently I was wrong. Oh well. It would be nice if I could stop kicking myself over "the one that got away"...   The Toronto police made an arrest and have laid charges against a 21-year-old Chinese student in Canada on a student visa for the killing of 9-year-old Cecilia Zhang. I'm so pleased for her family and the tiny bit of comfort this must bring them.    urlLink     Cecilia Zhang urlLink      One last update; SWARU came crashing down at 7pm on Tuesday evening. It only took them twogo's at it... not bad for Steeltown.  More to come...
