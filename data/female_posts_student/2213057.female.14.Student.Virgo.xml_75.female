TOO FRICKIN' BAD!!! sorry, lol. i would love to see people's faces right now. andrea and cory. best of luck in math class. speaking of which, it was so funny, because when i failed (yet another) math test, (since i wrote (cause she failed too) 'well aren't you a frickin genius' on hers) rachelle wrote under my score 'you forgot the frickin' date. and it was really funny cause mr. bloton crossed out frickin on both ours papers. we laughed so hard. yup, well, i'm out, of town, if ya know what i mean.
