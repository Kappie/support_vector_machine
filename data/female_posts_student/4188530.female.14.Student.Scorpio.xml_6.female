I'm just complaining it's going to get worse anyways so why should I care? Wait nevermind I might as well sign up for some club named Panties Hose... That's besides the point. I think I have a real topic to type about today. Someone be happy for me. *Crickets chrips then leaves* Going on... I know it's not a really big topic but it just been bothering me plus it kills time oh fun. Yeah but I know not  that  many people have changed but some have and I mean by a lot. I mean yeah change is inevitable (sp?) Hopefully you catch my drift. Changes are good even though they not the changes we want. If you think about it imagine yourself from the past years... how you've changed your looks, your personality, everything! If you haven't... then get a life! No I'm just kidding. I guess it shows you don't like change but that's ok cause I'm an accepting person, I think. Ok I'll come up with something better to type about for now do something else.
