I left at around 11:30 and I met my boyfriend Andy there along with my sister, brother, mom and grandpa. We went through everything---- all the art, photography, quilting, flowers, food, music, ducks, chickens, dogs and farm equipment. Which used to be owned by one Ray Gabeline. Hm. Carrying on--- so we did lots and it was fun....Andy and I left around 3 to catch the transit to the stop closest to my house.    When we got to Clinton we walked for about a half a mile to get to my house and then watched Family Guy till everyone else got home. Then Andy, my mom, and I made dinner and Andy made a blackberry pie for us. Then we headed outside with my brother and well... we beat each other up and chased each other around trying to grab our shoes. I suppose there's no intelligent way of stating exactly what we were doing. When my dad got home we had dinner, and then left for the fair again--- we met up with some friends of ours and listened to some more music, and stole some flashlight keychains. :D Andy and I spent the remainder of the night finding out how to clip the lights onto every 'clipable' surface on his outfit. When they were in his pants pocket we passed a guy that was obviously high staring slack-jawed at his pants. Mucho hilarioso. When we left Andy had them hooked onto every belt loop of his bleached jeans. Hahaha... ahhh good memories. So then we went back to my house and we had blackberry pie, and I drove Andy home. At 11:30 I got back home. I got to spend a straight 12 hours with Andy--- therefore it was a very good day.  :)     Today however, I am going to a preseason Seahawks game. We're sitting in our luxury box but still. It's FOOTBALL. On the other hand---- there is a computer with internet service. And two plasma tv's. And free food. But I'd still rather spend the day at home watching movies on a rainy day with a few elite people.    It's raining in Washington and that's always good. Better yet- it is raining on Whidbey Island. Specifically at my house too.   So I need to go change for the weather---- good deal. I'll write later about how it went. :)
