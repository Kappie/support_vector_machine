For all of you now emasculated Y chromosomes   believe me when I say it's not the muscles   And it's not like the time when I said size didn't    matter. I really mean it this time....it's the charisma   How can you look into those eyes and NOT be in love   They just make you want to build defense mechanisms for   him to save you from.....    4. Until him, I had the same obssesive crush on   Bruce Lee. I used to fantasize about me and bruce.   I've loved him since I was 8 years old.   Some dudes are just cool.....like it's in their swagger cool.... 5.I LIKE maroon5.... I lust Vin Diesel 6. I could go on about Vin all night......   but I won't....just sigh and stare.....  In Vin we trust.......
