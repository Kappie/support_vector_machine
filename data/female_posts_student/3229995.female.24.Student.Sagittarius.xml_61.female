(which she now has) and the consumption of alcoholic beverages (which she is now allowed). So it's decided that  urlLink Eskimo Joe  is the way to go. Eskimo Joe, of course, being an Aussie band of no particular interest to me but of particular interest to Kerry Elizabeth. They're playing at the  urlLink Metro , George street, in 2 hours....and I don't have a ticket.  I know what you're thinking "what a bad friend! She didn't buy a ticket for her friend's 18th celebrations!" but go easy, keeping in mind the many obligations an Arts student has...y'know...arts, and stuff.     [[6:30pm ]]    Across the road from the Metro we're killing time at Utopia records, where my friend Adam makes his money and where many a cd is sold at 120% retail. Talking to said Adam, I realise I have a seemingly natural bias against Australian bands [[ "yeah...they're shit" ]] and, more broadly, Australian exports in general.. has anyone seen 'Take Away'? Well I have.   [[7:00pm ]]   Needless to say, then, at this point I'm not really crying and screaming and sharpeneing the blades at the no ticket situation. After all, we have a hotel down the road where I'll quite happily indulge in bad t.v. for a few hours until they return..but, as a dutiful friend, I stand outside the metro and don my best 'Hey! Scalpers!! I want your ticket!' face.   But I don't think it's working.   [[8:00pm ]]     Oh well, Given up hope, sorry Kerry Elizabeth...better luck next time, and stuff. That's $25 I guess I really did need for living, anyway. I'm about to walk off...when, low and behold, my 'Hey! Scalpers!! I want your ticket!' face has paid off and I'm holding a ticket in my hand courtesy of the two weird smelling girls to your left.  Oh, so, so happy with this development.  Cue the picture at the beginning of this entry.    [[9:00pm ]]   Maybe the cynic in me was too quick to judge and at this point I'm feeling rather good about my terrific luck with the afore mentioned ticket. I'm really getting into it, maybe I'm not their biggest fan...but maybe I'll buy the CD.   UNTIL   [[ 9:30pm ]]    Suddenly an elbow in my back signals the arrival of a noisy, smelly (seems to be a theme tonight..) , unsightly and generally freaky man who has pushed his way through the crowd because "I LOVE THESE GUYS! I MEAN...I REALLY LOVE THESE THREE GUYS!" So for the next two hours, I'm resigned to the fact that I've paid $25 to listen to a giant smelly man sing his heart out. It almost makes me wanna get out my lighter. Then he does.   [[ 11:00pm ]]   Unsightly giant or not, this show is proving an eye opener to someone who possibly fell into the 'cynicism is the new black' trap  urlLink Emma  mentioned. Talent overcomes the stinkiness of my friendly hobo and hey! He's even somewhat entertaining. What the hey! Aussie music rocks!  ----   [[ 2pm, the next day ]]  I bought the cd.   And this is all I have to say.
