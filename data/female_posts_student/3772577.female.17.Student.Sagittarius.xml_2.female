It, like many other Naopli books, takes a relativley well known story or chracter, and looks at it from a completely different perspective. Other books like this are Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley. In this case the story told of the events in her life that lead Mary Magdalene, or Miriam of Magdala, to seek Christ. I wonder sometimes how much of all this is true. Is the usual story true, the one which includes the seven demons, six fingers, people turning to stone, magic swords, and the like, or is the opposite side true. That these were real and human people, with their own fears and trials and sorrows. And the tales that have sprung up around them were simply bred from other ignorant people's distrust, supersticion, and fears. I don't know.I do wonder though...It makes more sense to see all these fantastical stories as how they really could have happened. To look at the grain of truth behind the myths is intriguing, I find. It makes me wonder about world mythology too; stories like the tale of Isis and Osiris. Were they real, what were they like, what made people turn their lives and love into a fantastical myth? Anyway, B and I are planning a day on the road on Saturday. We don't know quite where we want to go yet. Either Mt. Robson like last year, or Kelowna; someplace different and warm. She asked me yesterday whether I wanted to go to the W.L. Stampede. Oh the IRONY. Every year since I can remember I have wanted to go there. So.Incredibly.Badly. This is the first year that I definately dont' want to go. I cannot be around all the horse-iness of the event, of the culture, cannot be around cowboys, of three year olds learning to ride before they can walk, cannot stand all the people that I was...that I want to be. I am not them anymore, not since he died. I want to be a part of that vast horse community again more than  anything . I can't and it hurts so bad. I don't tell B this however. Like I said, I am afraid of showing weakness. See the paradox. Yeah I know...get over it.
