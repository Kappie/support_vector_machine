I haven't slept since Sunday night, everyone here pretends they can't speak ENglish until they think we can't hear them, and half of us are already sick from the food...Oh yeah, adn an hour after we checked into the hotel, our professor took us out to the Red Square and left us to fend for ourselves. But hey, this is supposed to be an adventure, right? It only took me 8 hours in Russia to find an Internet cafe!  More later.  ~D~
