Oh well. She never said that she didnt need to get into all the places and that they were only going to look at a couple of the places she made it appear that all the apartments were going to be looked at. Again I was FURIOUS  To make matters worse I get to the apartment I wanted and come to find out after I filled out the application and saw the place (and yes I loved it) that I have to make 3 fucking times the income to move in. Excuse me.. 3 fucking times ?? I make less then a 1000 a month that would mean what ? 300 a month for rent ? what is everyone smokin??? lol.. So looks like unfortunately I will have to look in my neighborhood and find something here :( I'm not thrilled and I am sick to death of this area.  To make all matters worse Marina suggests a bbq tonight. As she is talking I'm thinking to myself this sounds great. She said something about her getting hamburgers and I could get buns she already had hot dogs and I would grab some pop and we would stop at the store and grabs chips making it sound like boom we were splitting it. We stopped at the bakery first and I grabbed the buns. Ok that was what I had agreed to. We get to the store and we get the charcol (she demands the BIG bag) and grab the chips and hamburger meat and the soda (now remember we drink coke, she has to have diet though not sure why she's so damn fat, and Alexis can only drink sprite) so off in the cart those go. Get up to the counter and I start sorting it out and she is lumping it all together and then tells me "oh I dont have no money" .. 57 dollars total.. *I* am the one moving here folks ! ! ! Then we get home and she suggest we do this at "her" place. OH no that means four bags of chips and soda and buns and charcol gets left at HER place WHEN we are done ?? NO NO  NO NO I fell for that once before. I suggest my place, the t.v. is here and she doesnt have cable. Ok so we get here and fire it up and make it.. Now this woman makes me look thin ok I have nothing against fat people *I* am one but damn 11 hot dogs ??? ALONE by herself ??? plus 1/2 a bag of chips, 4 20 oz of soda and then she tells me "maybe I should eat hamburger".. UGH.. I had 1 fricken hamburger and a handful of chips and I was full. UGH again... HOW can she eat so much ?   Between her and Dave I have felt so damn violated lately. No violated and abused and taken advantage of. I should have walked out of the store and said NO.. but everyone was looking forward to it. I should learn.. :(   Well that is my day.. I wish I had the place but oh well I dont make the money. I refuse to ask anyone to "sign" with me. So it looks like it will be a place around here and we will all be stuck with the same stupid thing going on in our lives.. I wish to hell I had the money to move the hell out of state.   Nuff depression I"m going to go to bed soon. I want to finish talking to M. and then curl up and go to sleep.
