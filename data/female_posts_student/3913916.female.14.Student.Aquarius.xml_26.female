Now I'm thinking of what book I should read next.   A Long Rest For ME  Today, I really slept for hours. I woke up at 9:45am then after lunch at about 2:30, I slept again. I was really tired and exhausted from all the work last week  and also this week  so I got the chance to rest for a very long time. It was such a nice day for me!! But I think this day wasn't enough for my rest...   Ella Enchanted  Lianne let me borrow her "Ella Enchanted" DVD. It was really a nice movie. I LOOOVEEEE it!!  Hope it happens to me... But not the "obedience" gift thing... I don't want to be SOOO obedient that I'll do everything someone says. I'll look stupid!  Anyways, the story was really funny, romantic and very MUSICAL!! I loved the songs there. Especially the part where Ella was in Giantville(?) and she was asked to sing. That song was really CUTE!!   Klarisse's Birthday  I'm so excited already!!  As if I'm klar...  But because, there's a possibility my crush would be there...  I just hope he does go...
