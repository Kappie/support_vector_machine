I mean, I'm pretty good friends with Jared, we talk all the time, and it would really make Lucas mad. The only problem would be getting Jared to go along with my master plan. See, the thing about Jared being Lucas's best friend, is that he's his best friend, so the chances of him betraying Lucas are slim to none. On the other hand, it is Summer, and Jared just might be bored enough; maybe even desperate enough to try escape such boredom by way of my plan. So Operation Jealousy has commenced, though the odds of success are lingering. If all else fails, I'll just hook up with some random guy from the beach or something. I think June will be dedicated to Operation Jealousy or "OJ" as I have decided to call it. Bring on the envy.
