Me and my brother are going to hang out and have some fun going to Blast! and stuff.  Then I'm coming back home on Sunday morning.  I'm excited to go and visit, but at the same time, I wish it was LAST weekend, because then I wouldn't be starting classes the day after I get back from Houston.  At least I only have one class on Monday, though.  And then the following weekend will be pretty easy.  :-)  Blast (again) in San Antonio, and probably some time in Austin, since I don't have class that following Monday.  We'll see.  Depends on how I'm feeling.  Jennifer leaves on Saturday for England.  She'll be back in May/June.  Just in time for my 22nd birthday!  WAHOO!  :-)  Anyhow, I'm hoping that I do very well this semester.  I'm sure I'll do GREAT in my music class... that'll be an A.  Probably my Early Childhood class, too.  I like that stuff, it's fun.  The World Lit. class I'll probably do very well in.  Because I like literature, and I have never gotten less than an A in my english related classes.  I'm a brain when it comes to that stuff.  So, as always I go into the semester being generally excited about classes, and having good expectations for myself and my final grades.  I have Dr. Bruenger again for my music class.  I need to make sure that I go and declare my minor this semester, early on.  Then next Fall I'll be in band, and then the following semester (Spr. 2004).  Just gonna get them out of the way.  I'm actually pretty excited about doing that.  I just need to work up my etudes some more, and hopefully get my new(er) clarinet before then.  :-)    Lemme just say that I had no idea guys were so clueless about the female anatomy.... do we like being fingered in our urethra?  NO!  Can we not sleep on our front side, because our boobs are too hard to allow us to do so?  NO!  We're not "tripods."  Boobs (real ones, at least) squish down.  Man... what an interesting night.  If someone asks me if I'll finger myself in the urethra for them I think my comeback would be, "When my clitoris grows hair!"  Enough on that topic... it scares me.  And I never want to SEE someone show me how they think a girl should be eaten out ever again...Anyhow, not much more to say now.  But I'll post more later after my trip to Houston!  Everyone going back to various places, have safe trips!!!       urlLink  postCount('9Jan2003');
