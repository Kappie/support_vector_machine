Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.   Cut out the article.   Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in a bag.   Shake it gently.   Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they left the bag.   Copy conscientiously.   The poem will be like you.   And here you are a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the vulgar.    -Tristan Tzara   I didn't use any of the proper nouns and adjectives just to see how it would look. I'll make another tomorrow with the proper nouns and adjectives in there.
