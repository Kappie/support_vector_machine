Well, we go there and Ms.Culter replies---"You didn't double-space?" At that point, I think my face blanched. I swear (and I doubled checked) that this lil bit of info was NOT in the instructions. So Kris and I rushed to my house, where we promptly had to retype her essay and print mine out with the correct spacing. When she was done typing it was 15 minutes to 11 a.m., our deadline. As I was finishing my corrections, I told her to warm up the car. It felt like we were doing a heist. lol. I then rushed out of my house like a mad woman into her car that was ready to go and we sped off (hmmm... I wonder how fast we were driving?). Kris pulled up to the front office and I  ran  out of the car to deliver the essay on time (last I checked we still had 5 minutes at the stoplight). lol I didn't even shut the car door. What an adventure! We're always doing crazy things like that. lol.  Anywayz, afterwards we treated ourselves to some Ben and Jerry's, which is surprisingly cheaper than BR. We were in the Town Plaza, so Kristine wanted to look at the pottery store, Painted Earth. We ended up staying there for about 3 1/2 hrs painting little star shaped ceremic boxes---she had also decided to do a ceramic car for her boyfriend. It was a ton of fun and way relaxing. teehee I got to get in touch w/ my creative, artsy side!
