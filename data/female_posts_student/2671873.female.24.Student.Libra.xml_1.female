Here I am in Ireland and somehow have found myself living with 3 18 year-old boys.  And then there is me the 24 year old den mother.  Dear lord in heaven.  I only express my exasperation because this past Friday these wonderful boys decided to have a party.  I did not know about it, and when I came home the following day at 1:30 I found that all our fire alarms had been broken (ya know those little red ones just like the ones in hotels) and a sweatshirt I had all packaged up to post to Seattle had been stolen.  I found the packaging and letter outside.  When I expressed my absolute disgust in the situation the boys replied with a shrug and continued to state that they had no control of the party and they didn't know  there was a sweatshirt in the package.  No apology, no offer to buy a new sweatshirt, more or less a cop out of the choices they have made.  Then yesterday one of the boys had the audacity to ask me for money for an air freshener he bought for the sitting room they get high in every night of the week.  Blech!  I wish there was a remedy to this situation, but I will just have to hold on for 4 months till school is over.  Then I can live in an environment that is conducive to my living habits.
