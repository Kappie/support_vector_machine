'Round 12 Kim came over and we just hung out pretty much all day. We barely did anything but sit...yeah Im so lazy. And finally right now my computer started to work. All day it has froze everytime I booted it up. It was really being annoying...but I ran the Adaware and I think that helped it a bunch. I hope there isnt a virus on it. Eh We'll probably have to send it uptown to Dave pretty soon but yeah. Well I guess I really dont have anything else to ramble about so I'll let ya go...   Current Song:  nothing  Current Mood:  happy  Quote of the Day:  "My mom said I couldn't spend more than 5 dollars at one place unless I was buying condoms." - Kim
