No need to ask, to beg for forgiveness I'm not the one who decides.  I'll be watching close NEVER to interfere again. ..I'll leave it,  leave you all behind simple part of a past  of which I don't want to come back to.  Life once felt great Then life stopped red(doesn't have to make sense to you) ...then it all made sense to me you give a damn... so why shouldn't I?  ..let it go ..let it be what once meant a lot ..is now meaningless  GOODBYE
