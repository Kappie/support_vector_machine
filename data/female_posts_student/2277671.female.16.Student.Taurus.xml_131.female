Perhaps there is a feeling of uncertainty that is creeping into your mind and suggesting that you are not mentally or physically prepared for the job that you need to be doing at this time. Do not doubt yourself or your abilities. .   tomorrow: ...  Responsibilities towards family, partners, and your career might be grating on you today, Monica, and you might be thinking in terms of throwing in the towel and running away. This might actually be a good idea - for a day. Be a little adventurous; go somewhere you've never been before, or do something out of the ordinary. Tomorrow you'll be back in the swing of things and ready to face the real world again. Enjoy your day.
