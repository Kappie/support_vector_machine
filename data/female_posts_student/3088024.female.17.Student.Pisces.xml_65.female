Now my goal is not for my group to accept me, but to find a group that accepts me.  Clarification: I have decided not to conform to be accepted, but to find a group that accepts "me."  Yeah.  Well anyways, today is definitely a manic day.  I was as bit crazy during study hall.  It was fun.  I think I am going to go to the library and put this energy toward my research paper.  Bye.
