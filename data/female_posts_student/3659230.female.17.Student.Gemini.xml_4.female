I'm still busy with all of these articles I'm writing so that I can be on the staff of this thing called Youth Connection and for the Chicago Defender and I'm entering all these writing contests, God I'm so busy!!! I need to make some time for fun now... hummmm. Oh and peoples, feel free to leave comments, I want some friggin comments!!! grrrr. theres not much to say really but when has that ever stopped me from talkin... heh... i'm debating on whether i'm going to put some of my poetry on here. so if you don't want to be tortured into readin it let me know and i wont do it but i am leaning on putting that up on here. right now i'm listing to dip it low and feel like gettin jiggy wit it (na na na na na na na) (na na na na na na) gettin jiggy wit it... okay i'll stop... tomorrow i'm gonna well hafta go work up at the school because i'm gonna be busy workin at dusable and walgreens, i hope that i'll have some sort of a social life after all of this. the first thing i'm gonna do is buy me a cell phone, cause i need one dammit!!! and then i'mma get me some new clothes... who wanna go shoppin with me??? its the chemicals i swear. my horoscope is confusing today, i kind of understand it but don't really. i think its saying that today i can either absorb all of the information that i'm being given or just focus on what i want to hear... i'd prefer the later... eh i don't know they shouldn't made the analogy thing, it makes me think and you know how much i hate that...well anyways i'm done with this for now... leave me comments...lol... well buh bye luff yaz!!!
