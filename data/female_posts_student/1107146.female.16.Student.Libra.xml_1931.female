I will, I just needed to rant.  Speaking of auditions, I'm working on those piano pieces (I think only Josh and Linds know about this, so everybody else, be really confused.  Right now).  And I think I finally have the beat down on the right hand.  Now I just have to tackle the left.  Wahoo, what fun.  Handbells tonight.  Even more fun.  Please, make me stop jumping up and down in pure excitement about seeing ALL my favorite people tonight.  Please.  Seriously.  Make me stop.
