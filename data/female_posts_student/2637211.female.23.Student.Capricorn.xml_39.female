I've realized I might not mind posting a public journal and share some of my exploits.   I've just started classes for winter quarter... history, history and more history. May sound tedious to some, but actually, this quarter ought to be gratifying. I hope. I'll wait to pass judgement until midterms, when the reading has gotten overwhelming and I walking to exams feeling like a complete ass because of how poorly I've studied. I did that in a few classes last quarter, and then felt like I'd really pulled one over on the TA when it came back with an A-. How the hell did that happen? I didn't even read one of the books. It was so amazing, and I was intensely impressed with my prowess....
