English:  we have to do this lame timeline but lindsey already had it done so we just had a paper war and me and emily threw little balls of paper at josh roppo most of the time!  Science:   started a stupid "electricity kit" ok, marc is like the champion of asking a bazillion questions per minute....HE WOULD NOT STOP ASKING ME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STINKING KIT!!!!! i was like I DON'T KNOW LEAVE. ME. ALONE!!!!  grrrrr  Spanish:   still have a sub because ms. borough sister is dying or something and we looked at our 7th grade year book, everyone looked soooo funny!!   History:   i learned how to get rich!!  woo hoo!!  Lunch:  (always the best part!)  i had to sit right by marc and across from eric and the only girl i sat next to was katie so i was LONELY and marc and ben kept singing these gross songs and i was trying so hard to ignore them and then eric was like "shut up marc, she doesn't want to hear that junk!"  i was like thank you eric  then the guys were like quizzing me on the music i listened to and ben would just tell me that my music was bad and that i was a loser and then (again, odd, odd) eric was like ben i think YOUR a loser....  haha i almost started laughing but he looked kinda serious..so i didn't  then....christa got like a billion laffy taffys so me and eric read them (ew mostly to eachother) because no one was listening (wah) but it was soo much fun i laughed a lot  Math:  easy breezy! cole moved away from me and lauren we were sad, then me and eric talked about how sad it was that he was so lonely last year.  After School:  we hung out a looong time and then marc bent down to tie his shoe and i was like "what are you doing??" because it looked like he was sniffing the floor... it was weird.  After After School:  I GOT TO GO TO THE MALL!!!  it was HEA-VEN!!!  i got like a bunch of shirts, and some shorts and a skirt and a belt and these cool sandal things that look like birkenstocks they are soooooo wicked!!  yeah so that's pretty much my day  and on american idol jasmine trias sounded like crap!!  she better get eliminated tomorrow or i'm going to hurt someone.... haha
