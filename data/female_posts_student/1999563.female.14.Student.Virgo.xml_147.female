That might be why..  ;)  So I went to ASB but it ended at 2:25 and my mom wouldn't come to 3 so I just sat around. I couldn't study for WA state history because my book was at home so I did absolutely nothing.  Fun.  Then I went home and like 5 minutes later I went to CYT.  I don't know if I will do Annie anymore. I don't really like CYT. I always seem to be a loner and out of the loop. I also can't sing, dance. or act.  Hmm.          My brother came come from New Zeland. Our teacher was sick so Anna took charge then Eliza kept yelling at everyone. I just wanted to hide in a little hole. The whole day I was stiffling back tears. I am a loser.  I want a friend I can tell everything.  One I can cry to.  One I can tell the achievements and not be put down.  One I can tell my failures too.  I just need someone.  I don't feel like I have any real friends.   At least I have you, blogger.
