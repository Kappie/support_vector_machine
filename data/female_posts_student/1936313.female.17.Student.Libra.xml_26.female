Started out in Spanish with Sperls asking "So What did Everyone do for Everyone for Mothers Day?".. wouldn't normally bug me.... except his such a freaking idiot he has to ask me as well... hah... I luckily held myself together enough to reply that "I'm the Mother in my house... and I got nada!".... which naturally created enough of an awkward situation to make him shut up.  Stupid teachers. Its in my god damned file.  Then again.... as Rob so unkindly pointed out.... its been 5 years.... I should grow up and get past it.  -whines- I don't wanna!!!!...  Life just fucking sucks sometimes. From that point on I'm just been miserable..... not wanting to talk to anyone or anything.... I'm gonna be stuck in this stupid funk for a week now... DAMMIT and I was doing so well yesterday...     I cannot leave here, I cannot stay, Forever haunted, more than afraid. Asphyxiate on words I would say, I'm drawn to a blackened sky as I turn blue.  There are no flowers, no not this time, There'll be no angels gracing the lines, Just these dark words, I find. I'd show a smile, but i'm too weak, I'd share with you could I only speak, Just how much this, hurts me.
