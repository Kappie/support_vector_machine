So, it took me a minute to figure out how to post another damn entry on this confounded thing; but, through perseverance and a bit of common sense, I managed to do okay...sigh! I'm thinking this might be the perfect little supplement/substitute for my daily, morning pages I write during the week.  For whatever reason, I didn't feel like coming home (from Yoga class, we'll get to that in a minute), sitting down at my kitchen table and writing three pages long-hand in my trusty notebook as is usually the case every weekday morning (except for most Fridays).  BUT...logging on and posting a blog sound just great!  Whatever. It's probably the "newness" of the whole thing, or maybe a hint of excitement at joining the celebrity list of those with blogs...I dunno. Anyway, had a nice yoga practice this morning.  Not a fan of getting up at eight on Saturdays, but for a bit of breathing, stretching and lunging, I make do.  Found a new coffee place on the way home, too, which we totally love.  But back to yoga for a sec...basically, it rocks the mullet all the way to Texas.  And that's all there is to it.  Can't get that "looking up.." line outta my head, either.  My usual instructor said it in class last week as she was teaching us a new pose.  Not sure how the description will work out on here, but we'll give it a go.  Just think about the position you usually take when you're about to do push-ups or lower yourself down onto some lucky person beneath you...now, imagine shifting your weight onto one hand and opening your body to the side with one hand on the hip you're lifting away from the floor.  Okay, NOW, imagine lifting that hand up toward the ceiling.  So we've got our legs straight...I mean RIGHT out in front of us, and one hand supporting the whole body while the other's lifted toward the ceiling.  Fun, huh?  Actually, there's a modified version, but I'm not going to explain it on here, so deal.  Anyway, once the balance is found (gasp!) the finishing touch is to lift the head up to look at the raised hand.  And that usually obliterates the balance that was tentative to begin with.   So yea, looking up changes everything. Nice little mantra for other stuff, too, I imagine.   Wonder how these little pages of blog-wonder compare with notebook pages...hmmm.  Doubt I've typed as much as three pages would be written, but still...feels like more than the usual morning pages amount.  Suppose I could explain those...they're really quite self-explanatory, but if it'll add more type to the entry, I'm all for it.  Basically, morning pages are written in the middle of the night, right after you fall into a deep, relaxing slumber.  Then you jolt yourself awake and write everything you were thinking about right before you fell asleep, along with whatever luscious dreams you were about to have, were it not for your obligation to write these damn pages.  Kick ass, huh?  It's great for self-examination and personal growth. Alrighty....I could keep rambling, but I know you're all busy souls with things to do and places to be and I refuse to let you use my blog as a procrastination device any longer! Besides, I've got to be a brilliant law student today and I need time to prepare myself for the job.  A shower seems like the best place to start....
