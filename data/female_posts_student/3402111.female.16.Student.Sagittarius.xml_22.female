And that is all for the band update of tonight....    But i have a question.  What makes someone pretty/good looking?  Did someone come up with a certain list of what makes someone easier to look at? And if so what is the distinguishing line between ugly/cute/gorgeous?   Because today at the ortho one of the new ladies, who i guess, doesn't know my family all that well said i was as cute as a button.  But since when has a button been cute?  Don't get me wrong i appreciate the compliment.... but that phrase always striked me as interesting. But i seriously wonder why it is that one person is good looking while another isn't.  I mean did we just evolve into a twisted society where we seek thin, tall, tan perfection?   Society now a days is based a lot on looks.  Why? Is that all there is?  It is kinda frustrating and I dunno.....
