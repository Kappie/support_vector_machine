Well, my counselor said it would be an enlightening environment and the course would help me expand my base of trivia knowledge to something other than calculus, chemistry, physics, US history, partial history of UK (and France, USSR/Russian Federation, Mexico, Cuba, China, and Nicaragua), and biology. So she said art history would be one of those courses that would come in handy when I am having an informal chat with my future employer... Guess she has some high expectations for me. Anyhow, facts I learned today that I thought would be interesting to share:   The Medici family sponsored a pirate to climb the papal hierarchy. The man eventually did become the pope. Women did paint. They mostly painted manuscript illuminations, so like picture books. There is an International Gothic style in painting that characterize the images in many of my picture books. It's houses are in a cutaway style to show what's inside and out and the people are a lot bigger than the trees and buildings. And last one right now, perspective -- the way to arrange a painting in a specific fashion although most likely in the most realistic fashion -- was created by Brunelleschi in 1424. The name of this perspective is linear perspective which aids the creation of three dimensional forms to make the subjects stand out with substance instead of a paper doll.   Well, this is the quick and superficial summary of my art history day. I am mainly concerned about how I can conduct experiment when I have to leave in the middle of the morning to go to my art history class. Today, I started the transformation and completed it when I returned only because the bacteria could wait three hours before I needed to do something. So my lab work seems to be very little right now, not enough to even fill a page in my lab notebook.  And to continue my worries, only for the opposite reason, I am wondering how I could teach myself ecology while half self-teaching myself art history and do experiments as well as do my mandatory cathartic writing task all before any of my deadlines. Icky... This feels as tight as school only I don't feel like I am doing anything for lab. And that didn't make much sense so I should go back to reading my art history text.
