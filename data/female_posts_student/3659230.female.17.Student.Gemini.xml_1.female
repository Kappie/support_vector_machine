You have the ability to change your mind quickly when you get information that suggests you should. Now, not only can you do an about face (or at least a change of direction), but you also can surprise others with the suddenness and completeness of this shift.  :::::::::::::: Its so weird how these things describe what I'm going through each day, coooolllll, lol, i feel much better because i've reconciled with all this crap that's been bothering me, and atleast started with others instead of keeping mum. My goal is to have everything out in the open by Wednesday or Thursday or Friday or Saturday nah Sunday sounds better. Eh I keep on postponing things and I don't know why I'm not being myself and telling everybody what I think. But then again half of the problems I have is because I do that too much but I don't really want to think too much about what I have to say because then it doesn't come from the heart its more analytical, you know what i'm sayin? Eh i'm out for now. I wonder if anybody reads this but me...
