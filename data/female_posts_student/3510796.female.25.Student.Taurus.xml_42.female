They are improving their shit.  Starting to remember where it all came from.  Is Leroi really afraid to play Let You Down?  Meh!  Am I really thinking of camping @ Deer Creek next summer and going to both nights?!?  I really, really want to.  At least I know they wont play the same songs both nights.  Commenting on the set lists  is getting me down my love, like a cat in the bag, waiting to drown, this time Im coming down.   It seems like I'm just saying the same stuff over and over.  Ah yes, where are they next....lets see.... Sat 6/26  Post-Gazette Pavilion  Burgettstown, PA.     Tomorrow is the big night.  Superflys birthday shin dig.  She called me today and asked if I would drive her.  I guess I should be the dd since she drove me around on my birthday, wait, no she didn't, she got sloppy drunk with me!!  I think my cousin drove me home.  I'll be ok, gotta take care of my pals.  Besides, getting drunk and trying to have a decent conversation with 'the date', might not be too impressive.  I gotta stop thinking about it, I am over analyzing the situation and that's no good.  I still have 3 weeks of class left.  Nothing is going to happen. What is going to happen is, I am going to head off to dream land.  And yes, once again, PISS ON THE CARDS!    GO CUBBIES!!   Peace.Love.DMB.
