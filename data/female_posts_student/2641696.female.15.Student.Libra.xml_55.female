I complained about champagne / alcohol. 2. I admitted that champagne had very useful bubbly symbolism, and that's why we should bring it out to celebrate because... 3. My website is finished! And 4. The 3 links are up underneath e i 3 3 t H i r d E Y e.    And the unimportant things:   1. My Grandma is coming over. 2. Styling stuff for hair never works. 3. My Easter bunny nibbles. 4. The Goonies is now one of my favourite movies. 5. I'm going crazy when I grow up. 6. I see things that aren't there. (^^;)   And the insanely important thing that you should all know by now and be gasping in awe at:   #1 :::::::::::::: MY HAIR IS CUT AND IT IS SHORT AND BOUNCY. WOO.   Okay. So that's done. I am now going to randomly ramble about my problems with the abridged version of The Princess Bride.     My first problem is WHO WROTE IT. Apparently the 'original' was written by S. Morgenstern but the book is also claiming that Florin and Guilder are  real countries  and that The Princess Bride actually happened! Now okay, I'm skeptical about the whole Florin and Guilder thing, but I mean the guy who abridged it (Goldman) has all these inserts and he honestly talks about Morgenstern like the man existed! And apparently Morgenstern was Florinese and the entire book was written in Florin at first and it's actually a massively huge satire making fun of Florinese nobles. Ahhh!   And you know how at the beginning of books they have quotations from various critics? Well one of the critics is this professor of 'Florinese History'!!!  FLORIN DOESN'T EXIST!  How can it have a historian! But then Goldman is also talking about how, if you go down some street or another in Florin, you can reach the Morgenstern Museum. Oh. My. God. NO! !@#$  There is no Florin!    But they all talk about it so seriously that I'm thinking... well, mayyybe... But no! It's impossible!   And listen to this: Goldman says that  STEPHEN KING WROTE ABRIDGED VERSION OF THE SEQUEL!!!!  No way. No way no way no way. King is a great horror writer, sure, but no way would anybody who liked Morgenstern let King write it. But Goldman is honestly claiming that King wrote it and now I am entirely confused. Because nowhere does it say that this didn't happen! This is insane!!   I mean, as a discordian, I take a bit of pleasure from being bamboozled. But jeepers creepers, it is absolute madness. At least in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy I knew it was fake. Here it's like... the twilight zone...   Sorry about that. But I needed to clear my thoughts. ^^;;;
