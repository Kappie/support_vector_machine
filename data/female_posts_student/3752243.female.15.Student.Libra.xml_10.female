I have just finished talking to my friend Katherine on a great invention called msn, she has told me of a book, we share the same likeing in reading and the like, so I am excited to read it actually. I leave for Eva's cottage on Sunday! I am so excited. I had a soccer game last night, it was fun I laughed about a million times. It was Emmas birthday I brought her a crown. I love you Emma, my litte chief! I was alsot told that one of my futre husbands will be coming to Toronto.(Yes one of them, I am planning to have in the upwards of 5 mabey 6)This one being Totti, soccer player extrodaneare, and from what I can see a sex pot to the max! i am kidding just a little joke to pass the tiem calm down I say! How big can flies get, there is one beside me the size of a beetle. Oh fun story, that I almost forgot. I went to Kurtis' house for a birthday get together. It was mucho fun. We had a bonfire, I got eaten by mosqui toes  on my  toes  ( ha ha laughs!)I got chocolate all over my clothes! Thanks a lot Josh! We had a good talk on the trampoline! I am hoping we hava another shin dig like that. I have noticed I talk like this is 1940s New York, which it is not. Speaking of that though (look at me all segwaying!) last night I watched "Guys and Dolls" with Marlon and Frank. I love that movie, but Marlon died, so it is my new mission in life to watch all of his movies, before the summer ends, that is alot of movies I know but worth it because Marlon is tres amazing. I must go get dressed now so ta ta mes amis. I will write more later but not now. P.s. Marlon= Marlon Brando and Frank= Frank Sinatra, and if you didn't know that you have some movie/music resarch to do, because they really were quite famous and I am appauled that they would be forgotten due to their emense tallents, but before I go on to and angry rant. Hoccha! Author: Eve.
