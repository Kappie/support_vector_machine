I'll keep writing about him until 11.55, which is about 15 minutes from now.  oh dot em dot gee dot, man.  he is so freaking good at the piano that it's not even conceivably funny.  I mean, his fingers are so freaking freaking freaking SKINNY and they look so knobbly and bony and and and and and and and it's like... THIN, and you get the impression that he's not all that strong, but then when he sits down at the piano and starts playing, it's like O.M.G.  they move so freaking FAST and they're ALL OVER THE PLACE and they go here and there and here and there again and cross over and and and they NEVER MISS A BEAT.  I mean, he was just playing for like ten minutes and I was just standing there looking at his fingers and his music and I was like, "holy crap.  I don't think he's missing a single freaking beat."  which is just CRAZY, cuz the song is THIRTY-FREAKING-NINE PAGES LONG!    and I was turning pages for him, and I was like O____________O.  and I kept not knowing when to turn cuz I was like... man.  I know it's soon.  I know where he is.  but does he have this memorized?   then I thought.  man.  he's got this whole freaking PIECE memorized!  and he's only played it for ONE MONTH.  hoooooooly crap.  he can find the time to practice piano AND still be ranked fourth.  and then I think, "I'm probably gonna be ranked higher than him next semester..."  but then I feel GUILTY for thinking that.  I have NO FREAKING CLUE WHY, but I do.  it's so freaky!  I don't want to feel bad for beating someone!  then I'll be dreading ranks... again!!!  and then my mom keeps talking to his mom... and then last night his mom told my mom something about her family, so now I'm like on eggshells around her, cuz it's like... strange.  and I can't elaborate any more than that without giving it away.  man.  he can't go back to china!  =(  I wanted to come back from china with his family.  hahaha.  man.  now I don't know what I'm gonna do come end of may.  cuz I can't fly solo, so I hafta tag along with a family.  well, not really tag along, persay, but be on the saem flight as a family.  So I don't "get lost at the airports".  yeah, right.  with my legendary skills?  no way!  haha.  I just realized I still gotta pack my backpack for bio tutorials tomorrow morning!  crap.  so I gotta cut this thing short.  and I didn't get to type that much cuz I was talking to didy!  =((((  she's depressed about jack.  lol.  remember a while back when I kept calling you guys and complaining about how much I was depressed by jack?  well, she's in that stage right now.  so I'm laughing at her!  hahahaha.  okay then.  buh bye.  I wonder if you guys will really read all that.  haahhaa.  I'll type more about him later.  tomorrow!  hehehe.
