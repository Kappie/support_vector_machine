Today, was a way to celebrate summer I suppose, my sister and I went swimming in our pool for the first time this year.  The water was amazingly clear and gorgeous, especially compared to the green it has been for the past 2 weeks.  Thank god for algaecide.  Everyone must go to my pool party on Thursday night from 7-10 p.m.  Actually, technically it's my sister's post graduation/pool/going away party since she's going away to Los Angelos for 6 weeks on Saturday.  But she said I could invite 15 of my friends too.  Her party isnt' starting until 9 and doesn't even have an ending time.  The guest list as is followed (changes may be made):  Alicia, Dot, Mia, Kim, Rachel Fink, Amy, Maggie, Sophie Quentin, Timothy, Faich, Jamie Kent, Chris Wert, Jake "Flash"  Well that's about it, if you made the list and haven't actually been invited yet, call me and tell me if you can go!  Go go go!  Anyways, today, I watched  Unda Cova Brotha  at my next door neighbor's house, and movies like that piss me off.  Because even though they're really funny, all they do is make fun of white people for 2 hours.  If a movie was ever made like that making fun black people, there would be no end to the complaints and controversies.  What people don't realize is that racism goes both ways.  Grrrrr.  Though I still like that movie.  We watched  Big Fish  too!  I love that movie!  Lol.  Not that I actually understand most of it.  That's about it for my day.  ...la Gu
