Not much ranting to do today, as Bruce and I went to see  urlLink Chamber of Secrets  last night.  Joygasm!! It was awesome!  I highly recommend it (surprise, suprise).  The Bassilsk is REALLY scary and the Wizard Duel with Malfoy is pretty damn cool.  Pay special attention to the very last scene (in the Great Hall), and particularly the noticibly younger Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson.  It rather obviously was shot first, at the end of shooting the last film.    The next film already has me aprehensive, with a new Dumbledore and a new director, who knows what changes will be made.  I'm just hoping that they put the Sorting Hat song in one of these days.  The film was actually pretty violent for PG, and I'm just thinking there's no way that Goblet of Fire will get a PG rating if they stay true to the book.  Who knows...I'm just hoping that Order of Pheonix will come out some time in the next Century.  ANYWAY, the Harry Potter rant is over...for now...  Christy and Jason are in town and I'm hoping to get to see them, if only for fifteen minutes at some point.  The problem is (long story, don't ask) the boyfriend has the car parked in front of his house right now and I'm sitting on my office floor.  The plan for today is to clean the house and do some laundry (going commando has ceased to be a cheap thrill) but I'll probably just end up plaing Yoshi all afternoon.  Toodles!
