((insert blood curdling 50's drive-in scream))  I can always tell when I'm getting sick, I guess it's one of those instinct things. glands are swollen, eyes are itchy, muscles are achy, a general feeling of nastiness has set in, and the desire to wear my pajamas 24/7 is at an all-time high. As strange as it sounds, I don't really mind being sick. The Raman noodles, the daytime television, the missing school, the rubber glove balloons from the doctor, the psychedelic cough medicine trips((oooh yaaa)), and the attention, gotta love the coddling.   so let's see, the virus has already invaded my system, so all I can do now is cut back on the liquids and never wear socks. ((am I seriously going to promote my own sickness just so I can not have to think about ANYTHING for a whole week?))   ((yup))  lately I have been overwhelmingly tired. tired like crazy tired. This morning I was in the middle of this dumb story in English and I kept blanking out and nearly whacking my head on the table, but being able to pull out of the dive for the highly polished "oak" just in time to look like a freak with a twitch. I did fall asleep sitting up a few times, in which I would dream a little, wake up and read a sentence, dream a little, wake up and read a sentence. kinda scary, but it made the story more interesting.  mom's out of town with stevie again and I know I'm repeating myself, but if I don't get out of Shreveport soon my eyes are gonna pop out, which is why I've decided to go see my daddy this weekend. I tried to see him last weekend but he sent my mom an email saying he couldn't afford it, then she lied and told me he had a wedding to go to. Mom should quit asking me to look at her email for her.  Mr. Beach taught me smoke on the water. Apparently it's not a single note and it's not a whole chord, it's a somethin somethin somethin and you just hit two strings. Either way it makes me feel very cool.  you know one of the most amusing things you can do near your computer besides changing the contrast of your monitor so everything is green is cleaning the keyboard! I love those cans of air that you use to blow the shit out, but around here we have this little brush thingy and you scrape it out. w00t!  54dddurfdwx   ^There's me cleaning the keyboard.. yay! LOL now my cat's trying to eat the little bitty brush thingy.  hope you guys will email me!
