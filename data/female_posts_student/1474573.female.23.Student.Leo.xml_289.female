It seems that Tookie has been writing books for kids on how not to get caught up in gangs and such, and the ramifications of it all.  He uses his phone privileges to call schools and talk to the students about gang violence.     Twenty years ago this man brutally killed 3 people (2 elderly) and sits on Death Row but he never actually admits to his guilt on the murders...  He's exausted almost all his appeals and may be put to death by next year.  However, the state says they'll change his sentence to 'Life in Prison' if he cooperates with a 'debriefing' - basically giving up some of the methods the gangs use for the gun and drug trade and such.  Tookie says he has nothing to tell because he's been in jail all this time.  He also talks about the honor code and not wanting to break it.  But really, if he's totally renounced the whole gang thing, why's he holding back at all, right?    What's even more fascinating is that he is up for the Nobel Peace Prize for all his work.  (he was also up for one about 5 years ago but didn't win.)  They say that it's not about what he's done in the past, but about what he's doing now.  True, true...but I still think that holding onto information because of the code of honor he took a long time ago is bullshit and that he doesn't deserve the honor bestowed on him unless he's truly let go of all his ties to the gang.  What do you think?
