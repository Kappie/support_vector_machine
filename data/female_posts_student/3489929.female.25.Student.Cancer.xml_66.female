Jefe is being an ass to Posh, which ordinarily makes me smile, but this time it is all too reminiscent of the ways he's treated me and there's a funny feeling tugging on me... oh, yeah. That's compassion. It's been too long since I've felt that, obviously.      I had a troll of a woman call me today. She called me and Posh both "country bumpkin whores." And a whole bunch of other names. I love it when they stop taking the meds long enough to call us and act like the fools they are.      And some bitch on Ebay is trying to give me the runaround. Hmmm. We'll see about that.       Mississippi is looking pretty good from here (God, did I just say that?).
