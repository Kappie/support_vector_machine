And getting new clothes is    cool, as long as you don't lose your old style. And getting new shoes is good, KENNY!,     as long as you don't forget your old ones that were with you through think   and thin.      What I'm    trying to get across is that in life, it is always good to move on to bigger and better     things, as long as you don't forget the old people and things that got you there.
