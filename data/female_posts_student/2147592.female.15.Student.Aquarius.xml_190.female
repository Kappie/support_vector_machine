Me and Matt didn't talk at all Wednesday, and he didn't come for the afternoon, I found out it was because his friend, yes I'm talking about Dj, had hanged himself. Thursday was good, we went into Bude and we talked, it was great. The kids gave me a class photo of them, I will get it enlarged later. After, me and Tab waited for him to drive past, I waved and we went to Pig's, but on the way we saw Lettie, so we went into town, but angy wasn't there. We then went to Pig's whilst Lettie went home. I joined her later and we watched a film together, one we used to watch when we was younger, it was just like old times again, and I loved it! Tab came over then we left to Pig's again, and then I got a phonecall from Lettie, she was crying so I met her, Oko had told her he didn't want a relationship after 4 months...I tried cheering her up but I'm just not the Jess I used to be, I am completely transformed, for the worst I think. But yeah, after that I returned to Pig, and my 2 binliners full of clothes from Lettie, I left with Nips and got a lift home with his dad. I later had a nervous breakdown leaving me with no friends :|  The next day was full of mixed emotion. From the beginning I was just waiting for Matt to come, when he finally did I felt so great! It was weird...all day we were rehearsing for our assembly. Me and Matt talked alot. It was cool. At lunch I sat with Sophie and the crew then I went to the field and took photos, none of Matt though. After we performed the assembly. I then left after the kids constantly hugging me :|. It was quite funny I suppose, one girl said to another about my hate for them... I then left, but returned to say thanks to Miss Mariott. I saw Matt, and asked him for a hug, then he asked me for his number, I left the building close to hysterics, I didn't know whether to cry or scream with happiness...so i ran to Tab, we then went to Pig's. The night was full of licking stones...we left early.  And today, we've been texting eachother, I now know that he has a 3 year old relationship...so there goes everything I suppose!   Well yes, here are the lyrics of the new song I like, lol:  You say it was like this I was torn between 2 worlds One full of promise And the truth I knew would hurt You say I'm no angel Tryin to put the past behind  So now I try to find A place to leave all Memories in my mind We try, our lives away Then stumble into the grave We cry, and still they stay The past won't go away The story of my life  See I was just thinkin Now my life is on the road The straight and the narrow On the route that I've been showed You know its not easy To try to change your ways  So now I try to find A place to leave all Memories in my mind We try, our lives away Then stumble to the grave We cry, and still they stay The past won't go away The story of my life  A place to leave all Memories in my mind We try, our lives away Then stumble to the grave We cry, and still they stay The past won't go away The story of my Try, our lives away Then we stumble to the grave We cry, and still they stay The past won't go away The story of my life  Well guys, I've got to stop trying to rely on dreams, or promises which I know will never happen.
