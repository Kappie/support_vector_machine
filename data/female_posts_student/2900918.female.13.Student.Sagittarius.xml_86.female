In the conversation, we were asked to come for a class gathering and all. As usual, there's lik display pix rite, and i think there were abt 4 of them tt is of their faces or neoprints' scan..   This normally happens to ppl [who are vain, flirty].  L8ly, i sorta find a relation btwn mandopop and puttin real-life faces as display pics. Ppl who listen to mandopop [and flirt], often use their faces or neoprints as display pix..  Its lik an asian thing...  i nided to download the yu jian song for our project rite, den i had to ask my bro frens to move away so i could download it.
