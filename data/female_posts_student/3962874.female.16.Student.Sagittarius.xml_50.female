I was really energetic right away, I think that means I don't need to sleep in until 1 every day because it only makes me more tired. Anyway I came over to dad's at 9 and now I am babysitting Ann's son Jordan and his friend Alex, their 10 and really hyperactive. I didn't even bother to ask if I was going to get paid I just did it becuase I'm nice. Hopefully I will. Daniel was going to go running with Zack today, but instead, they went 4-wheeling. That takes so much excercise. Not. That boy is never going to be buff and I know it. Oh well I love him. Dad was supposed to cut off the connectors on a harness for me cut he didn't and so I can't work on it until he gets home. I know that Ann is coming home around 3 but I don't know if dad is coming with her or not. He went to the doctor. The boys are out swimming and I'm getting hungry.
