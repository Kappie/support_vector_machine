It speaks to me. *chuckling* That sounds weird, I know, but I am a very visual person, and things spark my imagination a lot, and this template makes me think of warm summer days drifting into cooler autumn, sun setting on water, bonfires on the beach... I am watching one of my favorite comedies right now, Kissing Jessica Stein. You remember my friend T., the lesbian I have mentioned before? Well, she despises this movie because of the ending, which she says contributes to the illusion that all a lesbian needs is a good man. ***WTF???*** I certainly don't get that from the way the movie ends, but she is one of those women who takes anything that applies to lesbianism, no matter how remotely, as being one of two things. Either it is a personal attack on lesbians, or it is absolute fact, and somehow always applies to her life. I love her to death, but she frustrates the hell out of me when she hops on her butch soapbox and preachs to me. She can't even understand why I take offense to being called greedy, just because I am bi. If I was greedy, I would be screwing everyone I could get my hands on and pussy near. I don't do that. I love and adore my husband, and the one woman I can honestly say I love enough to WANT to sleep with is too far away from me at this time. Well, the old coffee cup is empty, so I need to go refill it, I shall return. I am going to get in touch with my friend Trish and have some new pictures done of me, I would love to have her drive up to the Twin Cities with me and do some of them at Loring Park by the fountain, but her schedule is always so full it seems, that I really doubt that I could make our schedules work. I am going to be there again soon, because my husband is going for another job interview, and he is going to be staying there for his new job, so we can actually get money together for the move. Gods, this is such an annoyance. I don't want to be separated from him for even an instant, but we have to do this. I am probably gonna be writing a lot in my blogs and writing a lot of tearful poetry for a while, during this time of desperate loneliness. Hey that sounds like a good title for a poem itself. I will have to remember that. Looks like another gray day full of rain is coming. I love rain, and thunder and lightning, but this is getting a bit ridiculous. I need to be able to harvest my garden, and I would rather not do so when I will possibly be sinking up to my ankles in mud or kneeling in a puddle. Besides, I would rather not have my vegetables drowning. On top of that, I have several pepper plants I need to transplant, and again, can't do that when the ground is this saturated. Maybe I should just transplant them into my big planter and grow them that way. It's always a thought. You know what is funny? I keep noticing that new things that should be listed on my interests lists keep popping into my head, but yet, when I was thinking of my interests, I could hardly think of any. Bizarre...
