After I went to lunch with Ariel and then to get my brows done. I know, completely superficial, but we've been through this, I'm Indian, I'm excessively hairy, it's okay. I told Erica once, "Yes, I can get tanner than you a lot faster, but you have the normal amount of body hair. It's a trade off!" Anyways, I'm sitting there waiting for Phyllis. She comes out with this other woman and they've both been crying! Then I go lie on the table. There is this blonde girl observing. No, I don't want some blonde to watch me get my hair ripped off six times cause I'm the freaking Bearded Woman. Whenever Phyllis is emotional, she takes it out on your face, beware. The wax was SCOLDING. It was so damn hot. She lays it on me and pokes me with the stick repeatedly. Then she rips it down the center, and it catches some on the side, and literally pulls out 10 eyelashes. Then some wax gets in my hair, she starts pulling at it, and I was screaming, "NO, it's fine, I'll get it later!" Man she ripped it off so fast and was rambling on. I thought I was going to cry. It still hurts. I am burned. I have nothing to do, I mean I could do stuff, but nothing is due tomorrow. This is crazy! AHH BLINK TOMORROW! Okay, let's face it, quizilla is right. I listen to "pop punk". I do, I admit it, it's fine. Stop judging me. Stop right now. I like blink 182, I do. They're a good time. There is nothing wrong with that, so there!
