I didnt do any free studying .. instead, i went with my golliwog to the Mega bus station to send him off. Having cried consistently over the last couple of days whenever i thought of his leaving today , i thought i could manage not to cry this morning. But of course... i cried again. Why shouldnt i? My best friend is going home and i am doomed to have 5 weeks of loneliness before my final exams. But if i try to think of it from a different angle, i realise that at least HE would be happy to go home. I would. I mean, who wouldnt want to go home to family and friends whom are terribly missed?   *sigh* i better stop wallowing in self sympathy.
