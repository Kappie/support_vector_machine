The Guest List for Turkey Day is as follows  Grandparents (2), Me, MK, Aunt Jennifer, Uncle Brad, Johnathan (5 years?), Anna and Katherine (both 3 years), Emily (5 months).   and then those staying in motels... Mumsie, Dumsie, Aunt Karen, JR, Trey (13 years), Nicole (10 years), Aunt Diane, Aunt Liba (Elisabeth), Uncle Brett, Blake (6 years), Uncle Bill, GreatGrandmother Shepard... and I do believe that's it  Needless to say, this is going to be quite some gathering.. and for the first time since Aunt Liba got married (which meant a substantially smaller number of little people running around) the Leslie's will be present... Isn't this exciting?
