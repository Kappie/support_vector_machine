I learned Ryo has a blog for Joshua, her so-adorable-goth-boy-rp-character-that-I-squee-over, which is amusing. I might do the same - Ryo has weird ideas, and sometimes she scares me (in a good way mind you) but she's very smart. I love her writing, and drawings, and she agreed to rp Joshua with my vampire Kano.   Why am I exhausted? A simple combinations of these factors:  -1 hour horseback riding  -2 hours swimming, water-fighting, attempting to stand on floating board -40 degrees Celsius  Urg, I can't stand thinking! My brain is aching so much. >.  I really need to go to bed.
