I was wondering why getting drunk is easier than just saying what we feel?why is it hard to be simple?why does talking about feelings,sound so distructive for most people?and why do most of us call a person crazy,exactly when he/she is telling the most true feeling? I don't know the answers. but what I know is we suffer much more when we try so hard to hideour true feelings.and we try everything,from drinking to death,just not to talk and face ourselves. we are so strangers to ourselves.we are not our own friends,yet we search for friends outside. to tell us their feelings! most of us are just mirrors of other people.a reflection.in work,in relationship.try so hard to show what others are satisfied to see.maybe we gain some respect,some money,some days not alone,...but what we lose is ourselves.and we can never answer this "who am I?" maybe we should just close our eyes and go on.... that is what my family does,and for that matter me.but for me there is something new.i am fighting not to be a mirror.
