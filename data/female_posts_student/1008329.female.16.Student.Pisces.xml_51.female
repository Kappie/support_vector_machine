And you wonder, which parent was hideous? He gives you these sob stories so you feel sorry for him. He pretends he's a fuck up. You find the "bad boy" image exciting. You get wrapped up in it all and forget your sanity. Soon you're delirious saying things that you "like him". Get out. Now. Before it's too late. You might think you'll regret leaving him, but really after you're out of it and looking back, you'll regret not getting out sooner.
