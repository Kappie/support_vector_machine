I guess we'll give this a go; suppose I should acknowledge my blogger-mentor, David Jack, first and foremost, as his little suggestion that I start a blog of my own tilted me over the "I wonder if  I  should start a blog" cliff I'd been teetering on.  Yay Dave! So yea, here we are kids, hope it lives up to all the hype....
