They will also print flags on vinyl material for 75% off.  I think it comes to about 25 bucks.  Just a little something the company I work for is doing for the community.  Want to have more fun?  Do a Flag Chain.  Print out 5 Flags on paper and give it to five people that you know.  Let those people do the same and spread nationalism!! USA, USA,USA.    ~Net
