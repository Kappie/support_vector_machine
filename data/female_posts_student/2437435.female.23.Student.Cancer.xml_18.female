I have just been going through some tough times and hoping relief from this storm is eminent and soon. I have never wanted to leave my life as much as I have during the past few weeks. My writing, attitude, relationships and friendships have all taken a severe beating. But as Morrissey says, "I will not say I'm sorry." I have been a people pleaser for so long that I forgot what I need to make myself happy. I have been stuck in the mind set that nothing will ever make me happy so I might as well make everyone else's day brighter. I don't care if I am misunderstood. I don't care if people are getting hurt, intentionally or not; it never seems to come out right away. All I know is that I feel alone and I am unhappy. One of Robert's friends Rashar (who happens to be the most lovely person inside and out) was telling me to not forget about myself while I am trying to fix everything. And it clicked. Why should I not take a compliment? Why not take some time for myself? Why not think about me? Well, at least for the last one is because I was always afraid I would be labeled as selfish, and I was still labeled that even when I wasn't being so. I just don;t know. I am working towards and saving for an uncertain future, and who knows, these may be the best years of my life. I have been trying to open up to people, and not because I have wanted to. But because I felt like that would make them happy. I am tired of putting everyone before myself... But even as I write this I am ashamed of these remarks. I am writing even though in my mind I am yelling at myself that Rob or Michelle are going to read this and be upset. I have to force myself not to delete these thoughts because I can't talk to anyone about my loneliness, and I fear that I can't write about it either. I don't want people to know about the vulnerable part of me because of stupid insecure reasons.  1. I think they will hold it against me or view me in a different light. 2. They will feel sorry for me. 3. They will remind me that people have it way worse and I should get over it. (This because then I would feel like my emotions are unsubstantiated.) 4. I don't want to be vulnerable. This is probably why I haven't been intimate with anyone also(not just physically, but in friendship alike). I am afraid of giving anyone that part of me because I have felt abandoned too many times to just roll with the punches.  More than anything I just feel stupid.. who knows, by writing this I may just hurt and lose the only people who have cared about me outside of family. But what can I do? I can't scream from mountain tops as much as I heart begs me to. I can't run away like my mind advises me. I can't forget as my soul is adamantly against it... I just need to be held.... I need to be told things will get better... That forever isn't just in fairy tales... That I am worth something of great value because most of the time I second guess myself wonder why anyone pays me any attention. "She says she loves me... then she must be insane." --Morrissey... I don;t have much and I am so sure its all going to be taken away at my own hand... Hopefully everyone won't hate me.  "Don't walk in front of me; I may not follow. Don't walk behind me; I may not lead. Just walk beside me and be my friend." -- Albert Camus
