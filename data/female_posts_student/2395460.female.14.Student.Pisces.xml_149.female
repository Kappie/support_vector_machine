It uses a fingerprint scanner to protect your bag from unauthorized access.  It's just a prototype now, designed by art student Louise Wilson, but I'm betting we'll see this thing on the market within a year's time. The  urlLink Sony Micro Vault with Fingerprint Access  USB storage device is very small and relatively inexpensive ($120 for 128mb) so the technology is already commercially viable. I also hope Louise will consider licensing her idea to  urlLink Coach .
