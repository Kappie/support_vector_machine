Considering the crap I have to do these next two days, though, I might need one just to be able to function.  I just finished yet another rehearsal for the recital piece for "Circle of Life" a nifty modern/lyrical piece with a lot of heart and soul.(No, not like that annoying piano piece you play with two people.) I'm the dance captain for the group and tomorrows our final dress rehearsal.  The only thing is, I'm also in another dance which is a tap routine and we have dress rehearsal tomorrow as well. Therefore, I will be at SLU's theater for literally the entire day. I get there at two, and leave at seven. Then,the day after that, I have to do it all over again for the actual performance for literally hundreds of people, most of which are overly proud parents of three year old beauty queens with pin  curls and Shirly Temple smiles.  So, I'll not only be throwing myself on the ground on purpose for the lyrical/modern dance tomorrow and the next day, but I'll be tapping my heels off of my feet for the tap number too. Isn't life a happy place?  On the other hand, this morning, I did something I never ever thought I would do. I got out of bed at eight o clock after my mom and sis woke me, drowsily walked out of my house in my pjs wich were mighty attractive if I do say so myself, and proceeded to witness a duck and her babies attempting to get themselves out of my pool. You see, they went in for a dip and found the bomenite too slippery for their webbed feet and couldn't climb back out again.   I, of course, came to the rescue by jumping in the water and chasing each duckling all over my pool and finally succeeding getting them all out while trying not to be attaked by the mother duck who was having an apoplectic fit at the fact that I was touching her children. Jeez, you'd think I was Michael Jackson!  Now it is time to relax and thank god for that. Quack!
