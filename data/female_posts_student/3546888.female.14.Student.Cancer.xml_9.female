I don't call relatives, I don't call friends. Who's bright idea was this?   Balls. Heehee ^_^ I threw a ball at my love. Mwahahaha that will teach him..for something...I forgot what though. Meh whatever. I got his older brother to throw the ball at him too. Good times. Good times. *shakes head with a dreamy gaze*   I'm not with him. So to speak I'm not allowed and we're just friends. JUST FRIENDS. And I happen to have the hots for him.  lol ~kt
