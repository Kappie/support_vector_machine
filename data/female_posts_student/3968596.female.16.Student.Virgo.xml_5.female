As soon as my mom saw me she asked for my help. She needed help to order her name badge and business cards for her new career as a realtor because she's absolutely clueless when it comes to the internet and anything else computer-related.  I tried  to be patience. I  honestly  did. But that's hard to do when I wake up late so I still a little achy, I haven't had anything to eat, and she keeps questioning me on wheather  I'm  doing the right thing. So I got snappy. End resullt: I'm responsible for her now snappy mood. ::sigh:: That's life.      I really  can  be patient and understanding but  not  after I wake up or if I have an empty stomach. And it's even worse if I'm related to the person I'm being crabby at because I won't feel much, if any, qualms about lashing out first before assessing the situation.       She told me that she doesn't snap at me when I ask for help. But oh is she wrong! She does it when she's very frustrated. She compare my behavior to my dad's, which I find insulting. She says that she didn't learn anything because I was too fast. Hmmm...well if she had  said  something oh I dunno...maybe I would have stopped. She also said she asked me at that moment for help because she didn't want to bother me later---when I'll probably be more content because my morning crankiness is gone?? If I had said later, she would have called me selfish and lazy, which is what she called me after this little episode anyway! Well, now she's out running errands. I've calmed down---I've had bowl of moose tracks ice cream, chocolate does do the mind good. Hopefully, she'll be calmer when she gets back. She won't drop what she said but what else can I expect? ::sigh::
