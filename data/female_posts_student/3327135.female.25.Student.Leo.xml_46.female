The book is about a new encyrption algorithm, which is to be released; and with this algorithm, it will be impossible for the National Security Agency to snoop on people's email messages. The book is good but not as great as  Da Vinci Code , as there aren't enough riddles for the reader to think about. I want to read the  Angels  Demons  next.  Also finished watching Family Man for the second time. Moses is so cute and funny   when he is in this show. Moses and Flora make such a good couple. I hope the rumors about them are true.          My two birthday cakes... yummy!!!    Birthday had passed long ago, but only remembered to post something here today. Better late than never.
