She’ll be staying every second Thursday of the month because she has a meeting at Grace Assembly in Klang.   Auntie Soon Yin isn’t my auntie. She’s a friend of my parents, and I call em all ‘aunties’. And though I’ve only come to know her a lil since we moved back up to Klang five years ago, she is someone who will always leave a last influence on me. You could say, in a sense, I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for auntie Soon Yin.   My brother was six years old then, my parents were still relatively young then (in their thirties… oops.) and they were on the Doulos. They were on the ship for only three months, my dad’s sabbatical, I think. That was where they met auntie Soon Yin.   My parents tell me this is how it went:  On a dark on stormy night, my parents and brother were in their tiny (it is tiny) and my brother said he wanted a younger brother. Then my parents said okay, why don’t you pray to God bout it? And he knelt down there and then in that little tiny cabin on a boat in Sri Lanka and prayed for a brother. When he finished praying, my parents asked him what he would do if God gave him a sister instead of a brother. He said no problem. (awww… hehehe)  Oh and a lil while after my brother prayed, auntie Soon Yin came to see my mom to pray for my mom. (she didn’t know bout my brother’s prayer) And she told my mom that God was gonna give her a child. Whoa.   Mmm and roughly a year later, Mary-Ruth, Martyn’s younger sister was born.  Oh I still haven’t explained why brother had to pray for a younger sibling, and you know, that IT couldn’t just happen like that. That’s because my mom has some hormonal problem so she can’t give birth naturally. In fact, the doctor didn’t believe that mom was pregnant with my brother when the results came out. So we both are miracle babies, you could say…. No no, not you could say, you have to say, because we are. =)  Well, there. Touching huh. Today you know a lil history on Mary-Ruth’s family….    Dad’s still sick. Very bad. He struggles to keep his food down. At least there’s improvement- the food stays in.   Please pray for him. He can’t walk properly, let alone work. And he has a Bible teaching lesson on Saturday and preaching at FGA on Sunday.   I’m going camp tomorrow, won’t be back till Sunday. Hope I learn something. They asked me to bring my jogging shoes. Cool, we’re going jogging… in Port Dickson. *grin*   Love you, Mary-RuthLowErn-Lyn   (I feel like typing my full name tonight. Oh did you know my Chinese name means ‘showers of grace’?)
