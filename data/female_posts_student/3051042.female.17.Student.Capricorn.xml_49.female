Steering? Because that's what Michelle and I decided I'd be... well, if I would have stayed the obliviously happy girl I was a week ago.  But with last night's killer low I'm surprised I'm still alive. Or something. The music line up for today? Dashboard Confessional, Something Corporate, and Maroon 5. Depressing, I know. I couldn't get to sleep last night. I woke up late for school. Forgot my flute. Said that I lost it. She bought it. I was half conscious up until 3rd hour. I saw Nick online when I was in Kellman's room, but it felt wrong of me to say anything. I don't know, it was just weird. I took my quiz. "Just let the little things make you happy." I was just happy that I could get my mind off of this emotional chaos and onto something that seemed to matter less... but it distracted me, so I guess that's a good thing. I got my first A on a math quiz... ever. 12/13. Kellman thought that I cheated. I need to give Josh a hug for helping me out last night. I would have never passed that quiz. So as he told me, to have the little things make me happy, to smile even if you're drowning in tears, I smiled. It was the fakest smile in the world, but I felt better... and I fucking smiled. I then left for Starbucks at lunch with Michelle and Gareth, they made me laugh and all was fine. Came back for 5th hour. Made my schedule for the week. Congratulations to me, I have two days of complete freedom. Saturday and Monday. Then 6th hour was alright. I performed my monologue, and everyone loved it. I smiled... again. I snuck out of class 20 minutes early, went to my car to be alone. I apologize Tiki for not taking you home.  I'm bottoming out, but it will eventually go back up. It took awhile last time, but I'll be alright. I almost forgot what it's like to be this way, I'm getting used to it again. Plus I'm on a roll, I haven't cried yet today.  It's like this Nick, I hate to love you but can't bare the thought of loving to hate you.
