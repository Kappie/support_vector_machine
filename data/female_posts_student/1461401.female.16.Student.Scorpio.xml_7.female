       
       I'm screaming out in rage With my life down on a page Being read by blind eyes Who never quite realize That I'm a human being Living, breathing, seeing The wrong person knows it all They break through my concrete wall They have the sacred book But they'll never take a look Just hang it over my head Making me jump, fall, or be dead But they can't read inside For fearing what covers hide Not wanting to read their name so many times Or my wasted words and rhymes So they just swing the silver knife Enjoying my pain, blood and strife But I know more than they ever will What it's like to have blood spill So go ahead, slash again You can't ever hurt me again You can't ever hurt me again You can't ever hurt me again Not if I forget your name first
