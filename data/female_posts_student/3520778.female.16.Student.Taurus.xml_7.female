But all the women I talked to, loved it!  Said it looked good with my complexion and it looked better darker...then of course there's the men who didn't even notice at all.  I think it's funny that women except change better than males...  Speaking of change...it's strange how things you thought were never going to change, do.  How people you think are your strong hold in life...leave, and you find you can do fine without them.  That happened to me today.  people I look up to and consider practically my siblings, are leaving my life.  Now that I'm writing all this down, I think it's because God's trying to make me depend on him.  Like I don't think other people are dependent on these two people as much as I am...it's hard to even think about and I almost want to be mad...but I guess this is the part where I close my eyes and hold out my hand for Jesus to take and start taking those steps of faith.  The only thing is- I'm scared and I don't think I'm ready to.
