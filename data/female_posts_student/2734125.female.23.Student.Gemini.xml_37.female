I feel like I've been holding my breath all winter, waiting, whining, waiting and wailing for light.  Its nice out today.   I saw an old friend yesterday.  I don't have many old friends, freinds that stretch past my first year of college are virtually non existent.  There was a change in me that felt awkward to attempt to communicate to people from the old world.  There was a shift in consciousness that felt too big a gap to fill when talking to someone I half knew when we were both raging balls of hormones.  There are some that I am curious about, one that I have even tried to get a hold of.  He was in the military, and I remember him as a first love.  I remember seeing him during an assembly, that must have been our sophomore year.  He was sitting two rows behind me and several people to the left, maybe right, memory can be transposed that way.  He was powerfully quiet and stoically interesting.  Possibly a young incarnation of a roman god of war. He was going to come see me during my freshman year, first semester.  On the day that he was slated to arrive I dressed up in anticipation of old flames burning, or smoldering at least.  I don't know if I would have been able to say all the things that I now wish I could, but I would have tried.  How different paths can be with small events.  He never came or called.  The next time I heard from him he called unfortunately while I was drunk or stoned in my dorm room.  It was a brief conversation in which I mentioned my new boyfriend.  I haven't heard from him since.  I still dream about him occationally, seeing him and telling him that I have been looking.  Occationally I think that I see him on the street.  Ghost.   So this old friend and I wandered the streets of Fort Collins.  With him time is out of place, or at least disjointed.  It is refreshing to be pulled out of mundane reality.  First we wandered from the bus stop to the river, where we sat and looked at the cold clear winter water.  Winter's stillness brings clarity, we can give it that.  He pulled from his bag: a thermos with hot water, a small iron teapot, tea, and two cups.  It was smooth and we slipped into old talk easily.  Every time I see him, despite our years of knowing, I still feel a nervous rush.  After that rush calmed and we commented on the oddness of humans for a while we wandered over to campus to talk to my roommate and then to catch a bus.  The sun was hot and I was parched even as our clasped hands sweat out sweet tea.  We waited at the bus stop and I was reminded of coolness.  When I see him there is always a slow unwrapping of my mind, like reawakening to what I am.  It takes a while, and is in stages.  The older I get the more I forget the path to that awakening.  That forgetting needs to stop soon.  We came back to my house, which he had never seen, so a tour was in order.  I proudly showed off the parts of the house that I spent cleaning.  They give me a peaceful feeling now, instead of the stress they held.  We wandered and laid down and looked at each other, let talk and words flow when they wanted, picking up on our own waves of thought as we chose, and they tended to mingle.  There is a simple vision in those seconds and hours that I am always amazed by.  When he left to catch the bus home I was sad to see him go, but these visits inevitably leave me with a feeling that I have held something more genuine then the rest of the world in my hand.  Despite a closeness we see each other rarely.  Originally we thought it was a universal conspiracy, and maybe it is, but I think that the guards are looking the other way.  We've seen each other at least 5 times in the last two years, possibly a new record.  Maybe our eyes meeting is what is dangerous.  His eyes take me beyond words into a place of other expression, which must be counter the laws of this world.  That state of beyond words may be the highest I have reached here.
