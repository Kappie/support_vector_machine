But still it makes me feel tens times better about the way I look.    Anyways My friend Sumathy has been emailing me and she is going to come and visit soon! That's really exciting. She wants to come for my birthday which would be awesome. She might have to deal with me being gone sometimes because I'm " busy". Haha  well I kind of am. I dont know we'll see what she and I can work out.    Oh man. Tonight I am going to be all alone.  WAH !! My mom and sister and stepdad are going to karate so I will be here. Unless of course I call Emily or someone to do something and I know that I am about to call Emily but if she's busy I dont know if I will call anyone else. We'll have to see how I feel. I'm not sure who I would want to call anyways. I'm not feeling too social.  Blah , I hate feeling tired and worn out. It makes me not want to do anything and yet I still want to go out.  Blah .  Blah .  Blah . All I ever do is complain.  BOO FRICKITY WHO , Gabby! Get over it!! Not that I even really have something to complain about but I always manage to find some random thing.  GRRR !!!    Well I'm going. I'm  tired ,  hungry ,  lonely , and feeling  lazy .    -gabby
