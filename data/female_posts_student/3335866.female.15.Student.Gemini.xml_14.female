I know that there are those among you who will doubt this and say to themselves that I'm actually a lame-ass pathetic middle-aged woman in Tulsa (no offense, Tulsa), typing away in the middle of the night. This is not the case. I am a teenage girl, and while I'm not affluent, I'm friends with those who are. I'm also white. Possibly you can see where this is going.   Ihave a little bit of a thing about my weight. I'm not fat,anorexic, obese,bulemic, or what have you, but there is a self-consciousness, as there is with probably 90% (I totally made that figure up) of people in my demographic. I'm 5'9", with a C cup and a size 12 and a large frame. I'm not fat, but  damn  does it suck to be larger than most of the girls in your school. You can have healthier habits than most (which I do), you can trim down to an 8, but there's still going to be those extra 2 (or 3 or 4) inches of height. It can be shitty.   This thing is a bit of a clusterfuck for me; I hardly know where to begin about my feelings and neuroses and cultural stigma and all that. I can't even imagine what it must be like for people who have a genuine lifelong-struggle  problem . It must be completely awful. There is such an obsession in our country with food. You know how when an annoying song is stuck in your head you try not to think of it... and it only makes you think of it more? That's how it is with food. "Yes, there is food that I love all around me, and I'm hungry, but the food is bad, mmmm, bad, so hungry, bad, bad, bad, bad, ohmygodIwantthatdonut!" POUNCE. CHOMP. And then the shame.   That isn't something I've had to deal with much. I've never had enough of a thing to actually attempt a full-on Diet, but I can imagine how it is. It's so stupid, though, that you have these two equally important and entirely different (and opposing) forces both pressuring you at once. It's Fashion vs. Food. Society against Snickers. There's not much conflict. You're genetically programmed to go with the food- unless your brain takes a wrong turn and goes with the eating-disorder route.   All I'm saying is that the food thing is this really big mess. I've dealt with my share of it. My mom has been saying since forever that she's really fat, and she's not(although I should add that she's never once pressured me to lose weight or told me that I was anything other than pretty). I've felt like I wasn't right weight-wise ever since I thought to have an opinion on the matter. I was a well-read kid, and I knew all about people who thought they were fat when they weren't and held supermodels up as ideals. I pitied them, and never thought for a second that I might be one of them. I thought that I was fat when I was a size 8 (which is really the smallest I can be and be healthy). That's sick. I thought that the model's in the Delia*s catalogs were the acceptable way to look.Since I didn't resemble them in the least, I felt I had to change myself.  I'm going to change horses midstream a little bit here. Everything I just talked about is absolutely true. However, I've been dealing with this for a few years now, and I think it's okay to want to change my body a bit and still believe in everything I talked about. There are good reasons for wanting to lose weight. My body-image isn't terrible now, either.  It's kind of difficult tofigure outwhat I really wantin all of this. My instinct is to try and lose weight. I really don't want to approach this unnecessarily though, or with dubious motives. I've thought about it, and I really think that this is okay. You might say that it's hypocritical to talk about dieting after ranting against the system of thinness/gluttony forever. You could also add that I'm stupid to even hesitate. I mean, I'm a TWELVE. Horrors! Get the cross and holy water quickly, Watson, 'cause she's eaten the hound of the Baskervilles!   I can only reply that I was ranting against the obsession and the stigma; basically, things I feel like I have enough control over to be out of danger from. I'm happy almost all of the time, with most of the aspects of my life doing well. If I had to stay the weight I am now for the rest of my life I could definitely deal with it. But my lifestyle and eating habits mean that my weight would creep up, something I don't want. And I confess: I would like to be more svelte. I've avoided clothes-shopping for most of my life. And I'm always happiest when I'm working on something. I know that the reward of looking better, coupled with feeling better and that great feeling of accomplishment, are definitely enough motivation to do this thaaang.   I'm going to go for it. I'm going to try to adhere to balanced, healthy eating standards for the first time in my life. I'm already going to the gym, but I'm going to stop skipping days. There is the possibility that this won't work, or that I'm approaching this for the wrong reasons. I'm fifteen. I can learn from any mistakes I might make. I'm not sure how to end this, except by hoping that this wasn't too self-contradictory. Wish me luck. I wish all of you bodily happiness.
