I have to wait to stop bleeding profusely before I can schedule an appointment with the "woman doctor," though, and judging from the way things are going, that could be a while.  Now that I am done grossing myself (and you) out...  I have serious issues with my immediate supervisor. We'll call her Posh, since she looks almost exactly like Victoria Beckham, a.k.a. Posh Spice. Posh has been working at the company for five years, having started a month after me. But whereas I have taken a "sabbatical"- twice- over the past several years, my time served doesn't count. As is, my one-year anniversary is next month.   Normally, when someone makes it to five years, they receive lunch on their anniversary, some flowers and/or balloons, and a small bonus check. Posh, however, having wended her way so sinuously into the inner sanctum of our boss, received a Louis Vuitton wallet (to match the $1500 Louis bag she just purchased), a Louis Vuitton fountain pen (really- who needs that?!?!?), and a brand-new, completely tricked-out cell phone. Market value of all of this? Oh, about $700. That's all.  And I can't get any money to repair my car...  I dislike her because she shows off all of her stuff but acts like she's modest and embarrassed to be showing it to people. She preens like a damn peacock. She spent the past two days playing with the damn cell phone and not answering sales calls, while we, her department, have been backed up and slammed with back-to-back calls. And since my boss didn't make his happy way into work until almost 3, he saw none of this.  It's cathartic to write about here, because if I had gone with my first instinct and walked into El Jefe's office and bitched about her behavior, I probably would have been sent home. As it is, I ignored her all day, which means he'll hear about it anyway, because on days when I don't talk to her, I have an attitude problem.  Oh, well.  If she had her way, I wouldn't have been given a raise last week. And she wasn't supposed to know about it, until she looked at my paycheck and saw it.  I don't know what her problem is. She'll always make more than me and get more than me, seeing as how her pig nose has a permanent brown cast to it from having been up the boss's ass so much.  Am I jealous? Hell, yes. I've been there longer, "sabbaticals" nonwithstanding. And I'm better than her. And smarter. She's prettier, but I'm a hell of a lot smarter. Shouldn't that count for something?  Oh, wait. I forgot where I work.
