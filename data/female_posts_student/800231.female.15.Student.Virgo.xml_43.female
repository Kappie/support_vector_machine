It was pretty boring at that point, they were doing their best to leave me out of the conversation. Anyway, T. came home on the motorcycle that he borrowed from my Dad and walked into our backyard. When I saw him walking around the corner I was like "OH GOD!", I think he may have been thinking the same thing though. He sort of stared at me for a bit until Matt told him to stop being such a loser and sit down. Then he introduced himself to me, even though we both knew each other's names. Actually, I'd never told him my name so I was a bit surprised that he knew it. He's really sweet, gave me someone to talk to. My dad was right though, he's about as connected to reality as I am. We were talking about school/work stuff and he gave me the saddest excuse ever for not going to college: "I had a chance to go to a vocational school, which I really should have done, but all the chicks were buffer than me and that makes me feel bad..." Good lord... Then again, his weirdness was explained a few minutes later when Matt asked me something about my school and T. said "Whoa, you go to Hale? I went to Summit! I had a bunch of classes at Hale though." Yup, another Hale/Summit kid, could've guessed. Anyway, we started talking about life there and how strange it is.  "You know, I blame Summit for all my problems. Instead of learning something useful we just made things out of clay and paint. That's why I'm ignorant." So, he's great, really. I think it went pretty well considering I'm such an spastic loser. God, I hope we can be friends or something. He's fucking hilarious to talk to and he's pretty cute. This is a very good thing!
