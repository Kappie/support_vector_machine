Through the many glimpses of shattered dreams  and dashed hopes for happiness,  my mind stumbles upon the "prodigious birth of our love."  How different it has been  from all the hopeless impostors of the past.  The soft grin of your lips  and the warm, content glow that shines from your soul's windows  are now the goals destined to my existence,  your happiness, the only reason for my being.  Through the tunnel of the future emerges,  you and I, star-crossed lovers,  meant to be, strong and true.   The battles is over, the conquest complete,  the moon and his army claim their now darkened territory.  I watch in silence, completely in love,  dreaming of you, my little star,  my perfect wish come true.   1998-by me -The quote, "the prodigious birth of our love" taken from William Shakespeare's  Romeo and Juliet - It is unlawful to reprint or publish any part of this selection without the author's written consent.
