So we had to come back home and thanks to Tyler and Jan we got home safe. Ive been pretty bored besides that eventful day. I went to Stone Mountain with some friends on Saturday without Tyler cuz he was at the lake...i was pretty sad the whole time...so that wasn't good...but the laser show was awesome and so were the fireworks. Today i went to bible study which lifted my spirits and Tyler came home from the lake so that just made the day alll the better...i missed him alot. Well i better go now im hungry cuz i haven't had supper and its 11:00. I'll update again soon i promise.
