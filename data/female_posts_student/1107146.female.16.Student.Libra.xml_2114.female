And if so, do you just postpone it til some other time? But I bet it's not for the team or whatever, but I wondered.  Dudes, not to sunshine on the funeral or anything, but the most random thing happened today, some lady calls and informs me that I'm the "Mayor of Smashville" at the Preds game this Saturday...it was really random. She called and said I put my name in a drawing at some Sofa Connection somewhere and that I got tagged. The interesting part is that the last time I was at a Sofa Connection, I was nine years old. So, today's lesson, kids: the wait is well worth it, especially if it involves a zamboni ride (which it does!!!!111oneoneoneeleveneleven).  Alright sorry, I'm done.
