Yet, my life is this: I am only working part-time at a golf camp for kids, even though I have no skill in this area.  I feel completely abandoned by my employer and find myself questioniong my skills and knowledge although the job is not that difficult.  I find that I am doing it all on my own.  I miss the Mustard Seed and the supportive staff (not perfect, but supportive).  I miss being challenged and finding that I love my job. I am in a desert and I am only the only one and the only person around is God. I know that if I keep seeking I will find something...but for now...the thirst is overwhelming... I need to be reassured that everything will be okay and that although my future is blurry and unknown, I will become someone that is better and able to help others...I guess I just feel this desert pressing down on me and I feel that not knowing is a scary place to be...yet I will be 'strenghthened in my inner being with power through his Spirit'...that is all I have to hang on to...those roots that can't be pulled...
