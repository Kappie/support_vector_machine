I shall perform as usual and disregard my assigned chores and do whatever I feel like. So, the plans for tomorrow are as follows: 1. Wake up around 10. 2. Think about cleaning the bathroom and the hall, but eat breakfast instead. 3. Drive to Blockbuster and pick up some movies for her fat friends to watch at the sleepover. Included will be: Donnie Darko, and whatever the heck Lizzie wants 4. Swing by the movie theater and see if I can pick up a ticket or two to the new Harry Potter movie because I'm a nerd. 5. Decorate the house, because, though a chore, I enjoy it. 6. Go swimming with Lizzie to get her used to jumping off the rope swing. 7. Think about cleaning the bathroom and hall again, but eat lunch instead. 8. Tell Lizzie she needs to hurry up and clean the bathroom and hall before her friends get here. 9. Lizzie's friends start arriving and I watch Donnie Darko while the fatties swim in the lake. 10. Chubby people come inside and I leave to watch Harry Potter so that I don't get the fat disease. 11. Go back to the house so I can stuff my face with hotdogs and pray that I don't get the fat disease from the infected children. 12. Rest up for SATs Saturday morning. Yippy.
