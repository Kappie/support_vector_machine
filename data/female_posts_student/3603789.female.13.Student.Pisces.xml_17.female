The invitation had a link in it, so it was filtered with the junk mail.  About the title? Less is more. I think Beat Around The Bush is sufficient. (Dude. I just used the word 'sufficient' in an everyday activity. Cool.)  Dunno where Jonathan is. He hasn't updated the other blogs recently, sooooo yeah.  Oh, Garrett? Try to use those lovely spelling and grammar skills they teach you in school. It makes you look smarter. And if you throw in the word 'sufficient',  well .  Oh, and... Bush sucks.
