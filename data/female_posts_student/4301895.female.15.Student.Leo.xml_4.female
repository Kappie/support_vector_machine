My body started to chill, and as the sun was setting, I ended up crying. And as if to protect me, you came and stood silently by my side, didn't you? I felt like your eyes reflect a wondrous world You taught me how to dream and long and such. I told you only a little while ago, even if we get torn apart, I won't forget our dreams, so... ...even though I'm far away from you, I don't want to give up. Even though we've always been rivals. I don't need to hear any news, beloved friend I don't tell anyone else my foremost thoughts We'll meet once more, right, beloved friend I won't forget you, beloved friend =This is Dani with her friend Lisa=  ~A memorial to Danielle~
