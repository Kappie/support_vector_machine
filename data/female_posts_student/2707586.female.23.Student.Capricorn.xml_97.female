It also looks bad when you can't move the next moring and you were supposed to help with an event. All I know is I won't do that again. Probably because I won't give up alcohol again but I think I will stick to beer for a while. I definentally will be on beer at 7 Saturday morning when we do breakfast club before the grand prix. You have to love a town where the bars open at 7am so you can get drunk before their events.
