She went to go see a filipino concert.  I know she was estatic to get the invite. I was happy for her too.  I mean, hello, how often does that happen?  Her godfather from her wedding invited her.  I know that she needed it too.  Anyway, everything has been okay here.  I mean there hasn't been too much drama over here...haha that is always a good thing.  We have had our fair share of drama, you all are probably already bored with that.  So I won't even go there.  I will say that I think things are starting to look up for us.  Oh so let me tell you about my job.  I totally forgot to tell you guys about it.  First, it is killing me.  Since I have been ill with constant migraines and the ongoing battle with my frickin' allergies, well, it has been tough to do things, let alone wake up early in the morning.  Anyway, this job isn't early by regular people's means...lol but early for me.  I come in about nine in the morning and I stay for a couple of hours.  I prepare the children's activities (better known as cutting out projects and labeling them with each child's name) and after that, I help facilitate the children in their ongoing project (also known as pasting, and helping them draw things).    I like this job for many reasons, it is preparing me to have interaction with children, although this is far from the age I would like to teach, it is teaching me the patience to help each child and work with each child.  I think it is also interesting to see children in a school atmosphere.  I see my children on a very daily basis.  LOL  Don't get me wrong, I love them to death, but it is nice to get a break from them and the constant crying and fighting.  Oh Nalani is driving me nutty today.  Anyway, I like it because the children I am working with are fabulous, they are a good mix and well, for the most part, they are well behaved, of course, there are the few who you make you not want to be a teacher, but overall, they are great kids.  I also like the lady who runs the home daycare and can see that her program has a lot of potential.  It takes a special someone to be able to give up their home like that.  I don't like this job because let's be honest, the pay sucks.  LOL  But I guess I get paid every week, so every week I have at least $24...which pays for half of the gas Ed uses to commute.  This job is also a few blocks away, so maybe if I gather enough courage, I will actually bring myself to walk to work...I doubt that, with the Sacramento-like heat we have here.   So we are going to ahve a BBQ, was supposed to be a surprise thing for Kathleen, but that didn't pan out like I wanted it to.  Oh well, life goes on.  She will have fun though.  I think that Magic Mountain is what she has wanted to do for awhile, so that will be fun for her.  Only a handful of people are coming, which is cool by me.  I love it when it is just close intimate friends around.  They truly make the time more enjoyable.  I was reading Leila's blog the other day and read the one about legacy.  I thought about it and thought about it.  There are a lot of things I did in my life with the best of intentions, but am not proud of and am hoping that things will change in me for the better.  I think I have.  I am not as judgemental and not so much a control freak.  I have learned that I cannot control other's lives, no matter how much I think I know of the situation.  I have to just let people live their lives as they let me live my life.  Everyone has to fall and get up on their own.  I have learned that my role is as a friend and not a mother.  I truly miss Keiko and Tim.  Tim drove me nuts, but he loved with his whole heart and completely and he is the most loyal friend out there.  There isnothing he wouldn't do for his friends and I am going to be grateful to him forever.  Keiko is the best listener and the best person to remind me of what is important.  I miss that aspect..now that we aren't so close anymore, I miss that ability to pick up the phone and just call her and talk for hours.  She is a busy career woman now and has so many wonderful things going for her.  I am so very proud of her.  Anyway, I have to put my rugrats to bed, I think the sugar has FINALLY wore off.  Thank goodness for small miracles.  Have a great weekend.
