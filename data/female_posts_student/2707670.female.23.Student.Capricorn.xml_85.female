I had some questions on my homework so I went to her office and she offered me juice. How sweet is that. I only spent about 10 minutes getting help on homework and I spent another half an hour just talking to her about our class and how we give no response at all when she talkes to us. Get this I am in a class with 80% FRESHMEN! Makes me feel really great! I do like her even though in a previous post I cussed her for giving low grades.  She also told me that it was a waste of my time to be in her class and that I didn't need to do all of the work she assigned because I would probably pass anyway. I like her more and more everyday.
