And we lost! Damn them! That edutacator didn't know what he was talking about. *looks superior*   Anyways. If you read this, please comment. You can even say "your life looks like a pile of poo~ from up here!" Just comment! ...Oh, wait, no one reads this, eh?   Anyway, allover, it has been dull. *Woah! Don't surprise me like that, Alison!* I have a geography test tomorrow, which I should be revising for, but who can be bothered? Its just geography. I'm to smart for my own good anyway. *swishes hair*   Any whoozle, i must dash. Good day, kind sirs and madams, and I hope you don't DIE! *winks*   ...moglemoglemogle...    ~censored incase one of those fuckin little kiddies readis it. The bastards.
