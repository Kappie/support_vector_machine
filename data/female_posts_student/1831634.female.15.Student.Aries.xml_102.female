I have nothing better to do than to play neopets all day.  This is so sad.  Jackie taught me mirc yesterday, but I'm too lazy to go and get it.  How sad is that?  Too lazy even to get manga to read.  I'm a saaad sad person.  I'm too lazy to even write long blog entries.  Even for my bestest friends!  I'll probably write more when school starts.  And I have more interesting things to write about.  Other than being bored.  Yes.  So, taa, everyone!
