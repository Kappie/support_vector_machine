You're probably right, Josephine, the hype is most likely puffing up the killer.  Maybe the police are hoping to lure him out.  Glad we don't live there anymore.  And it sounds like you and I are at just about the same place!  I'll be 50 in 2 1/2 years, and Kim and I will have been married 26 years then (if she can put up with me that much longer...).  Happy birthday.
