Hopefully you're coming to Spring Day, because there's a band there that's so heavy, that, to quote Mr. Adams, "I remembered you were a student in my class, but you were rocking so hard, I forgot your name!" Tryouts were superawesome, and we had the whole soccer team and the band before us as an audience. Dude, it was hardcore heavy metal. Ooh, and the band before us with Tyler Rothamel in it (for Abby: they all look like the biggest EMO kids ever (and are)) are doing the song  I Believe In A Thing Called Love ...for those of you that haven't heard of The Darkness yet, for shame! They were pretty good, but no one's going to hit it like the real thing, of course, but still. I tried to convince Nick to do that one, and he was like, "Eh," so I guess it's better that that never went off.  Wow, I need to stop. I'm getting so excited and it's about a month away. We still have to do APs before then, and I need to do the research paper, I'm at the library and I'm supposed to be typing it, but surprise, am not. Williamson Public is a cool place, it's a really nice place, the grounds are really pretty. They're right next to BGA, btw. Hmm....  Alright, so. Time to get started! Peace.
