Yet he makes me feel so horrible and worthless inside sometimes that I don't understand that I love him. And there are others that like me. That would treat me nicely and do what I would wish of them. But why is it that my eye is set on him? I want him so badly I can taste him. I don't know what I did to lose him. I wish he would tell me. But he barely tells me his name anymore. I am so lost without him there to listen to my problems and give me advice, telling me it's all ok. Sorry if this is just a bunch of rambling but it's just my thoughts.  Yet there is a man that does love me and would die for me...but I push him aside. What is wrong with me?
