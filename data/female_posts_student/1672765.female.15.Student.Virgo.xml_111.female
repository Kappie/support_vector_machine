I mean, come on...  There is only one reason I am glad Spring Break is over and I can't admit it. So use your imagination.   Summer at my house. Taking a cool shower, but you never get dry because you just step out and sweat.  Oh summer how I hate thee. Well, you're alright, but I prefer fall and winter by far. Weather-wise. And holiday-wise. And I guess mostly everything-wise. But some aspects of summer are alright. Just not the humidity/heat/sunburns/etc/etc.
