Last night I had a great night. A friend of mine and I had decided that we were going to head to a driving range. So after my last patient I headed down to his place. It was the first time I had actually been in his condo it was quite nice.  Anyways in the next 5 hours I learned so much about this friend of mine. Things that I would have never guessed. We never made it to the driving range. But we sang as he played piano (one of the surprises) had a wonderful diner followed by a great dessert! We talked and laughed the whole night long. It was great. He treated me like a lady which was so nice after the way that me ex has been treating me. He even opened my car door for me!   You know we don't respect our fellow human being enough. Treating others the way we would want to be treated regardless of the station, position, or life stage. I mean last night having a friend treat me the way he did was completely something that is just not the experienced norm! I not taking about being a gentleman and treating girls differently (although ladies lets admit that is VERY nice). I mean treating everyone with respect I think it is an art that our busy society has forgotten. We are SO self involved and busy getting from one place to the other that we do not take the time to stop and smile to the random stranger passing buy. That smile could make a difference in someone's life.  Wasn't it just the other day that the police said they apprehend a man who had the arms and plans for a mass murder here in Toronto. But was thwarted by a friendly dog.  Take time to respect and honor the other humans that are struggling beside you. You never know what the pay off might be!
