I am not in the mood to go home.  I couldn't go to the funeral today, no flight availability.  I don't want to be single anymore, I don't think.  I'm not sure.  I am just tired of looking forward to something that isn't gonna happen.  I don't know how to explain this.  I feel like I'm waiting for life to start...school keeps me waiting, waiting, waiting...but will it happen?  And if it does, will I be happy?  And why isn't this the "life" I'm waiting for?  -sigh-  I have nothing of any interest or substance to talk about.  I'm fighting with my roommate because I think he's stealing my things.  It makes me feel really insecure and upset inside.  I feel like I can't trust him.  And that upsets me a lot.  All he does is come back on the defensive and then what can I do?  -sigh-  It's hard to conduct an argument between two law students.  Especially a self-righteous one like him.  Anyways...back to cleaning.
