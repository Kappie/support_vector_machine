Also I asked Louise about yesterday and she helped reassure me a bit, so now I'm not worrying abuot him and Lauren. I really was just crazy and full of hormones. The worst thing abuot me today is that I seem to be a bit irritable. Today's been boring... I guess this post is just to clear up a few things. I'm talking to Laura on msn now, I feel like I can't talk to her as much as I used to, but we are still talking sort of acting as close as we were. I hope we both get over this soon so I can go back to telling her every detail of my love life, lol! I was kidding, I need to stop remember. So no more mentioning Chris unless others bring him up. I am also allowed if I'm talkng about something else and I have to mention him, but then I do NOT get into a lengthy discussion about him. I can do this. Maybe. I might post later...  Bye for now! ~Hannie xxx
