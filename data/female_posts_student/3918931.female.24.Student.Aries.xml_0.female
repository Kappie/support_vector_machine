So I went up, signed the paper in 2 minutes, and then I was done. I decided that while I was up there, I would go to my little brother's lacrosse game up in Annapolis. He played ok...but they got killed 10-2. Ta well...maybe they at least had fun. Later, I got a call from University of Maryland saying that they have yet to receive my transcripts. The transcripts I "supposedly" had sent from FIT back in May. Good ole FIT.    So, yesterday I spent the day driving backdown to South Carolina. Did I mention it was 9 hours? I got backto the lab around 7pm and got straight to work counting little crab larvae. It's not nearly as fun as it may sound. The vertical migration work I didfor Dr. T and Paola was successful. Dr. T. emailed the results to me, and thoseminax larvae have an almost perfect ebb-tide transport pattern.    The picture you see is fromwhen I went out to retrieve the light-traps that we lost. We got everything out ofthe water just as the coast guard came pulling in. urlLink
