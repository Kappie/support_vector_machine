Everything we WANT to know, everything we THINK of, everything we DO know is in this pyramid. Every once in a while a brick chips. It must be mended or it will continue to chip, then the one above it will be exposed, then it will begin to chip. And who do you think mends it? The godly people in this world... The people who believe that it is their duty to be as one person (do they even call him a person? I don't know) wishes them to be. They are the followers. They are the brick menders. These brick menders- what do they mend their bricks with? Well, they mend it with a universal tool: religion. Religion is available, it's cheap (until the church starts pressing you for money, you lucky ducks), and it's there for those who have nothing else. I'm not saying this is a bad thing- maybe our world is better off built with this mortar of religion. But, what will happen in the following scenarios:  1) Our world gets so heavy, with all the mortar, and all the bricks and mending, that we can no longer evolve. We cease to create new ideas because the mortar of religion covers up all our new pathways to new growth. IF you didn't know, the chips in the bricks allow for new things to be added. 2) The mortar no longer works- the bricks become immune to the mortar because of the weather (the passing of time, aka). What if all of a sudden we find religion is not the answer, then we can't change that because we've always depended on it. 3) The mortar cracks up and falls off... We are left completely unsupported: We are left defenseless and confused because we've spent our whole life depending on religion to tell us what is right, and what we should do...  Just some food for the mind.  Phileda
