I didn't wanna cancel it, but I had no choice. They were disappointed alright...and now I feel as if it's all my fault cos they ended up sitting at home anyway. =/ I told them to go without me, but then they didn't want to. *rolls eyes* Like it's so deadly for them to go out without me. Oh well...I'm probably going out with Lynn tomorrow. Well..I'm not sure yet, but if you're reading this, I'm sorry for cancelling, Connie and Rachel. =p We'll make it some other day, eh? Oh yeh...AND I STILL WANNA WATCH 'TROY'! PS: And it is so NOT cos I just wanna see Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom! *hides behind couch and peeks out* I swear! --Fluffles--
