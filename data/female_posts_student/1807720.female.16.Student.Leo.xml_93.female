I didn't cry unlike yestday and well it did seem like a very painful lesson to understand that chem stuff but I had to ask about it because I really didn't understand it.  I think I understand the stuff a little bit better now but it's still sort of confusing.  I feel bad that I probably like drove her up the wall today as she tried to make me understand.  I thought I would never get it but I think now just maybe I can do the stuff.  It is hard though, and frustrating when it seems like everyone else can do the stuff.  She was like "oh this is so fun" and "you all understand, great!" and like I didn't understand and like it is pretty hard to think something is fun when you get frustrated when everyone else seems to understand the stuff.  I think chem will get better tommorow though.  I know that I can do good on that quiz tommorow.  I just have to re-gain some of my confidence because after that chapter 8 test I was really hard on myself I have to admit because I really tried my very best and I got a 63%.  I am trying not to worry about it too much but it's hard because I want to still make honours and I still have two re-writes left so I think I want to use it for that chapter 8 test.  I know that I can do better then a 63%, I KNOW that I have the power to get like 80% and I really feel like I deserve and 80% and I earned an 80%, I just don't know why I never seem to get an 80%.  I just pray to God that all my studying will pay off.  Maybe chem can start going good for once, and well if I could understand some more stuff that would be nice.  I always study and stuff but the marks never show it.  I have a 68% average right now in chem and yeah that is what I see when I look online on that U-courses site but in my mind I see an 80%.  I feel like I should have an 80%, I should have an 80%.  I really should but I just want to at least get my chem average to a 70% before the final.       Prayer to God God I ask you to help me get through Chem and help me make honours.  You know how much work I do and how much I study.  You KNOW how much effort I put into everything.  All the effort that goes into trying, and trying to understand.  I pray that tommorow on the quiz I will do good because you truly know how much effort I put into studying for it.  I pray that I score an awesome mark on my re-write and that on those tests next week and the quiz friday in Chem. I understand so I can do good.  I pray for a mark that will reflect my effort for once.  I pray to you to understand my math and just score an amazing mark on the next math test because everyone knows I deserve a good mark, a really really good mark for once and you know it.  I pray for so many things and I do want so many things but if I just understood and had marks that reflected my effort then I would be much happier.
