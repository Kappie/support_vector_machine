Me and Laura are having a Halloween movie marathon and then going to Lauren's Saturday night for her party. Then going back to Laura's for more movies. And if everything goes ok, I'll be seeing Adam too. I'm really excited, I want to see his new place, and him, no matter what happens. Sexual or not.  Not a lot of Blogging, taking the long weekend to have fun instead. See ya all on monday.  BY THE WAY, DID I MENTION? WE MIGHT BE MOVING TO BRENTWOOD!!!1*here's to hoping I can convince the parents*
