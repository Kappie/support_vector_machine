Not gonna dewl on the fact Kat is leaving...it's not bad or anything, just sorta sad and fustrating ^_^ she didn't tell me she was going, i had to ask...at least she'll be happy... depressed and not really in the mood to talk or write...miss B amazingly, so much it's starting to scare me...i wonder what's going on with him...
