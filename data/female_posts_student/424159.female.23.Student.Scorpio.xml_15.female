I have to constantly tinker with it, until I am appeased for the day.  What a tragedy.  Anyway, today wasn't half bad.  Got up at like 1:45 pm, went to Hebrew class, went out to dinner with my family, worked on this thing.  Got a Hebrew quiz tomorrow.  Cool.  By the way, what the hell happened to  urlLink Friday Five ?
