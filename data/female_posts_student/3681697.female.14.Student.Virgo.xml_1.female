If you dont want anyone to read them then dont bring the to school for people to see.If u ask me its just an attention seaking thing.Its gay and to make matters worse they leave them everywhere no matter which way u turn theres always one there screaing out to u  READ ME,READ ME ,READ ME.And they always have the owners name neatly printed on the front.So u dont get confused about which depressed,suisidal teenager your actually reading about. Opps there goes half the depressed highschool population out of there class rooms and sharpening their pitchforks.with signs saying kill the evil person who insulted our poem books. * i apologise to those of the high school depressed population who wouldnt do this.but hey its a steriotypical world isnt it. If you are a type of person who likes to analise everything then i would strongly advise that you stoped reading right now .I hate people who analise everyhting that you do. Its sooo annoying its like if your annoyed at something that doesnt mean that theres anything behind that.somethings really are jsut in black and white. well thats all im going to say bye
