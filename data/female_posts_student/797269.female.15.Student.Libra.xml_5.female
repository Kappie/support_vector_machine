Failure- My mom let me drive up the drive up the driveway to get the mail by myself today (hey, I have to practice somewhere!). So it goes very well, I can't back down the driveway so I spin around in the street without hitting anything and end up in perfectly in the spot at the end up the driveway. Put the emergency brake on and get out. Forgetting something? Yeah I was.  Just this tiny little detail... turning the car off! Maybe 2 hours later my mom has to go to the post office and asks where the keys are. My mistake immediately dawns on me and barefoot I sprint out to the car (trying to beat my mom). I bump my head hard trying to stick it through the slightly ajar window and finally open the door, turn the key and pull it out just in time for my mom NOT to see. Luckily, I checked the gas gauge later on and it was still at about 5/6 tank so I couldn't have wasted too much. I've decided I want to get a really crappy car because it is likely I will ruin it. It's just a fact, it will probably happen.
