Bypass copyright law!)  urlLink http://uk.news.yahoo.com/020927/80/daka5.html  Aparantly people are booking for the cinema tickets already. Has it come to a point where no one really cares how good it is, just that 'I've seen it'? Hasn't it become more like a fashionable thing to do, and every one's got to like it. Does any one really care about how good the film is? I thought the first one was crap! I thought Lord of the Rings was admazing though! I wouldn't buy the Harry Potter film, and I openly say that. I honestly also thought the fourth book was crap. But it seems to of become a second bible, and the moment any one says any thing about how it's bad they're some how doing a bad thing, aren't we supposed to share our oppinions? Ok, so I might not be the best person at explaining things, but do you still get the gist of what I'm saying? Mmm... I'll go run back into my hole *snatches some monster munch*, can't survive without them!
