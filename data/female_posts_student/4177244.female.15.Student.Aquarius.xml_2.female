Well, here it is.    Hey, Meg!    How are you? Well, for the past few weeks I've had a few things to say, but haven't because I don't want to clog your inbox (or whatever it is your mail goes to). But now that I have more than one thing to say, I might as well.    First of all...thank you for posting in your diary that your last name is pernounced Cab-itt. My mom and I fight about that practically every day (She goes, 'Oh, your reading Meg Cab-Oh again...' just about every day, and I go, 'No, mom, I'm reading Meg Cab-itt books.' And she's like, thats not how you say it). Anyway, I'm glad that now I can prove her wrong, hehehe... Nextly, it's awesome that your birthday is on February 1st, because mine is on the 2nd. There are other people born that close to me or directly on my birthday, but nobody I actually LIKE. So I'm all giddy and stuff that we're birthday sistas.    And the last thing I wanted to say was that I know some people write bad stuff about your books (I.E. Oh my god, Jen is way too nice! or Jen is way to mean! or Don't always write about hot guys...etc), but don't let it get to you (even though I know you haven't)! You're a wonderful writer and nobody should tell you otherwise because they're wroooong. You're amazing!    The only one thing in the whole wide world that I don't like about you is that you don't like Nicholas Sparks books. Or Robert James Wallace. Those are both very talented authors as well and deserve a little bit more than that, especially from a fellow author. But I still love you!       Your #1 fan,             Katie      I love to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas...   I can't wait to see Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement. Even though it has nothing to do with the books, I still can't wait. It comes out on Friday. Woop woop!
