I was really worried that Mrs. Pillard would give me an S and I wouldn't get anything at all, cause she was threatening me since I never actually do anything in her class.  But she was too lazy to change grades, which is what I expected.  And it's not like that do that badly in her class anyways.  Since I did mange to get Distinguished Honors, I have gotten Distinguished Honors every quarter of this year, which is the first year that I managed to pull that off.  In 6th grade, I got a stupido 91 in Science, and therefore a B, and I also got an S in Intro to Tech because I didn't finish all of the stupid typing tests since I couldn't type in 6th grade at all.  In the first quarter of 7th grade, Mrs. Waters gave me a stupido S in FACS because apparently I didn't do the stupid "Random Acts of Kindness" assignment and she was all like "you need to complete your homework more consistently."  And of course I had Mrs. Pillard as well in 7th grade and I always get an S in her class because I'm too lazy to do a stupid project in Physical Education.  God, these people take their classes too seriously.  Anyways, that's why I haven't had a perfect year until this year, and I'm very proud of myself.  And I got some random latin awards too.  An award for getting a *Gold Medal* (while Alicia got Magna cum laude) on the National Latin Exam, and two awards for PCS, one for my amazing project, and one for the academic PCS award, or at least that's what I think.  I'm not actually sure why I got two certificates for PCS.  Whatever.  Currently, Alicia is attempting to find an outfit for the graduation celebration thingy, without much luck.  Lol.  And we should probably be leaving right around now since it's like starting in 10 minutes.  Whatever.  The party is gonna be so much fun!  Human bowling and a velcro wall.  w00t w00t.  ONLY 2 AND A HALF MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL!!!  ...la Gu
