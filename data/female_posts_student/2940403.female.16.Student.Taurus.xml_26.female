I took my drivers test yesterday, and passed.  :)  I'm happy now because I also get to have the car for the rest of the school year because my sister won't need to bring it back to college with her.  Now I can stay after school as long as I want without having to worry about a ride.  I don't even need to leave for school until I'm ready now.  Yay.  My sister and I got along well this weekend.  We exchanged sweaters, and she even got a tattoo.  It's a cool asian-style elephant (to go with her childhood nickname) on the back of her left shoulder.  It looks really good.  Maybe when I'm older I might get a small tattoo of an Alligator.  :)  Probably not.  I got angry when I found out she took my Lucky perfume to college with her, when I needed it for a job interview.  My parents and I both agree that even if she only used a little, she will have to pay a dollar amount back to me.  Seems like some family issues are finally being handled in the right way and not just ignored by my parents and dumped onto me.  The cat is still recovering from her front claw removal... it didn't help when I accidentally stepped on her paw when she was running under my feet for food.  Damn that cat can scream.  I felt bad, even thought it was kinda funny to see the look on her face.  I'm waiting for a call from Marri, the human resources lady from Target, to call me back about my third interview thing tonight.  I really hope I get a job... I really need one.  I need to start paying for gas money, even though Ellie never had to pay for gas money for about a year when she got her license.  Oh well.  I need to start saving up for my trip to Costa Rica next year for SES.  I can't wait to get there.  I can tell my new meds are working, not by the nausea or the stomach aches or the headaches, but I think my mood is getting better.  I'm able to deal with people a little better and not get so angry with them.    I am still a little puzzled at a few people, though.  They were stupid enough to bring alcohol (mixed in with orange juice) to school and drink it.  They ended up getting caught of course, then getting suspended for four days.  I think I should stop calling them stupid ass mother fuckers in the hall though, I think they're getting angry at that.  I think I should just let them make their own decisions.  They are my friends, but hey, it's none of my business so I'm officially out of it.  I really need to update this stupid template... I don't like it very much even though it's my design.... I just can't find any good programs or websites to use.  They all have their plusses and minuses.  :'(  ::tear::
