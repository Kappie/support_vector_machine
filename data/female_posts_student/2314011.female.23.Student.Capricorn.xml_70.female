Of course, I could read cases, but I'm not sure I'll get to those because I'll be too busy to actually do anything too school-related.  Could go for a drivey, maybe through the Lentil capital of the world, hmmmm???  Do have a dirty Mexican porn to watch.  And a book to finish.  And Sean Astin's on Ellen's show right now, so what more do ya need?  Sam and Dory together!    "Don't go where I can't follow!"  "Ooh! Ooh!  Pick me!  Pick me!"  "I can't carry it for you..."  "A clam!"  "...But I can carry you!"  "Are you my conscience?"  Oh, and props to Martin Luther King, Jr.  Thanks for the day off, man, way to go.
