People I thought were just douche bags to begin with, suddenly are even bigger douche bags.   Go figure.   On a happier note...    I want to go to the movies. I want to go to Santana Row. I want to go driving with someone to the mission hills. I want to fall in love. I want to take a bubble bath. I want to go skiing. I want to live all alone. I want to find a really really really close friend. I want to change my identity for a day. I want to be famous. I want to be wanted. I want to be happy.   But I need---    to finish my homework.
