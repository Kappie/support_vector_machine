I went to a family party today and saw family I totally forgot about because I haven't seen them in ages or people I didn't even know were my family. I saw my old cousins who I used to spend like every day with, they were nice. This one girl who's a freshman in mw I guess talked about me before cuz she saw me in the hallway and so we got introduced, she's like gorgeous. Then this one lady who I think is like a 2nd great aunt lol signed me up for a beauty pageant for philipinos in chicago suburbs and I said sure but I was jsut being nice, I hope she doesn't go through with it cuz I'd lose so bad. After that me, tim, and my mom went around Golf Mill a bit to kill time, I saw Joanna at 5-7-9 hehe. Then we had to kill more time cuz they didn't want to go home and we had to go church like 2 hours later anyways. I went to Dominick's so I could cash my check, 60 dollars..lame but oh well, money is money. I get jealous sometimes cuz people have such high paying jobs and mine isn't but as much as I complain, my job is pretty easy compared to others. Just one of the many things I've been realizing. So after I cashed my check in, Tim needed to get something from Home Depot but somehow they forced me to go into Menards with them. Britte was working, i
