Apparently, the little guy/gal was attempting to move the vacuum and get it all positioned in a way that he/she could rest on top of it. Now, I can interpret this situation in two ways: (1) he's trying to clean the house and trying to upstage my cleaning efforts from last weekend or (2) he misses me terribly and is clinging to the vacuum because it was something that I had touched/used.   Your guess is as good as mine. Personally, I'm leaning towards the latter interpretation. He loves it when I touch him. I do give a good rub down after all. Wink, wink.I'll have to investigate when I see him this weekend.
