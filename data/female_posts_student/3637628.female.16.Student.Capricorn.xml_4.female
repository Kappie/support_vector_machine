"Accio Kool-aid!"  -If that doens't work, you try to control your sisters mind with a curse to make HER get the kool aid (lazy girl... 50 points from ravenclaw)  -You declare yourself head boy or girl and immediately start telling everyone off for 'thundering'  -When walking down a street, you label run down shops and pubs as possible entrances into the magic world.  -When you mention that a certain shop has a probable affiliation with the world of magic, your family and friends agree with you, but then take 50 points from slytherin for your cheek.  -You spend hours tapping the bricks of those buildings in special orders hoping that a secret entrance to the magic world will appear.   -You collect plugs.   -You try on every piece of silvery fabric your mom has to see if you turn invisible   -You refer to your Chemistry class as Potions.   -You refer to Voldemort as "You-Know-Who", and no one has any idea who you're talking about.   -You were kicked out of the movie theater for standing on your chair, throwing your shoe at the screen and yelling "THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN IN THE BOOK!"   -You 'divine' that the sixth book is going to KICK ASS  -You count the days until you're old enough for your apparating license, and everyone else thinks you're talking about driving.   -You own what YOU call a wand, but what is actually a dowel, twig, or chopstick of some kind.  -You say "wicked" all the time because Rupert Grint does.  -Your family thinks your wand is wicked awesome. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Yeah, i'll be the first to admit i'm a harry potter geek!  but i'm not alone (Highest pre-ordered book in history)    Anyway, I've decided to benevolently acknowledge the begging of a fan on the message board.  I.e. I've found a place to host my pictures for free (with a little tweaking of the yahoo system) and i will be including them in my next post.    However, i'm working on something RIGHT NOW with my sister that i haven't told anyone about yet.  This will put btothethird to shame, if i can finish it before katie goes back.  Lastly, and this really has no bearing on anything, my name for the yahoo thing is piratejess45620.  If anyone (besides christina, who i told) can figure out what the 45620 stands for, they will get a prize!!    The Prize will be really cool, but the question is really hard  Hints:  1)It has nothing to do with my street address 2)It is not arbitrary   love n' kisses  jess
