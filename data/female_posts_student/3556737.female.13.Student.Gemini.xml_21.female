He is such a very active person. He has one son, and a chinese wife, i think. He talks FRENCH, and everyday he talks, not really talk, but like tell us something in FRENCH, which is so cool. and on the first day, he taught us the rules and regulations of his class and the whole school. he taught us to RESPECT girls, no profanity words or language, and more rules that i forgot. and oh yeah, his class is about SPEECH. everyday he will write proverbs on the board not biblical proverbs, but like saying, and we have to write about the time that it was a fact to us. like `all's well that ends well'. then my second period class is Mr. Douglas, he teach us LANGUAGE ARTS. He is not that much. He ask us if we can follow his rules and we're like YES, so no problem. then my third period is Mr. Harmsen, my PHYSICAL EDUCATION teacher. oh gosh... i remember yesterday in p.e. class, we did curl ups, push ups. but i actually did 16 curl ups in a minute. i would have had more if my classmate ELDRID, didn't fart. it was disgusting. and well, i did laugh and i lost focus. that was stupid. and so unfair. i must have did like, 30 or something if it wasn't for eldrid. moving on people.... my 4th period is Ms. Black, our Life Skills teacher. She's not very mean, but my first impression was that. Seriously, i thought she was black american, but she's not. i guess its just her last name. now my 5th period teacher is Mr. Wertz, my SCIENCE teacher. He is a very big fan of Directions. He wants you to follow directions, or else. my 6th period teacher is Mr. Douglas, again. then my 7th period is Ms. Manahane, social studies teacher. not much... and 8th period teacher, Ms. Torres, Math teacher.
