Okay, so according to Tina I owe you guys a bday list, though is it just me or did Tina seem drunk whilst typing her post? =P I went through the shops this week and OMG I dunno what I want =S I hate it when that happens cos I know as soon as my bday is over, I'll finally know what I want but it'll be too late by then. So I guess just get me anything except clothing, stationary, earrings (duh), bags, and anything else I wouldn't want LOL Yep, that should narrow it down for you all =P Hmmm...sorry, not doing a very good job, but I guess I have been hanging out in the electronics department lately cos of all my babysitting and playing those demo games on Xbox and PS2, and I've been looking at lotsa cds and dvds. Nothing picked out though LOL Just pick something, I don't mind, and if you're stuck, just get a shopping voucher so when I know what I want, I can still get it. Does that help at all? =S Anyways, I guess I'll just leave you all to it.  I watched Pride and Prejudice videos today. It's actually not too bad compared to the book, wished it had subtitles like on DVDs but nonetheless, I managed =D Still contemplating whether or not to read through the book cos I haven't touched it at all this holidays and there's not much left. Anyways, I have to get back to my psychology and business studies assignment crap. Cheerio!
