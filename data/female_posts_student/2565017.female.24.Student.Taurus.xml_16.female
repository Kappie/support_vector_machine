Welcome t-shirts and tops. I woke up really too early today, but I remembered to do almost anything I was supposed to, before school, wee hee!!! ...took a beeday-card and 2 mother's day cards to mailbox (now don't be thinking I have 2 moms or something, cos the other card was for my darling, so beloved grandmom)... remembered to take a pillow to school....  Hmm, you might think what on earth did I take a pillow to school for... to sleep on lectures? No, no, I'm not quite THAT lazy yet... we had all day in auditorium (and I knew about it before hand) and the chairs are just terrible there, so the pillow was to sit on.... It really helped, a lot! Now, I thought earlier that the classes are going to be sooo boring... but I have to say, the surgeon really knew how to keep a lecture. He kept throwing case study type of problems at us, so we'd have to think for ourselves, not just write down. You had to pay attention all the time, cos you never knew when he's going to ask something and from who... He also cracked a few jokes, that weren't bad. I wish ALL our doctor lecturers were like that. We also had enough breaks. I almost can't believe it, but I'm actually looking forward to tomorrow!!  Ahh, studying feels nice right now, I couldn't be happier about my attitude change....  I don't know what to do for the rest of the day, ummm, not like I have much time to do anythingbefore bed time.... I have got to go to sleep earlier today, I felt dead trying to wake up this morning. I don't want to feel like that tomorrow morning, kiitos.  Oh, well... my room looks like it could use a cleaning hand..... some other time.... maybe tomorrow, after a night of lots of sleep. yeah, tomorrow....
