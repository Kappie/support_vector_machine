It seems like every time I have places to go and people to see, it rains, which sucks.    Since I'm going to be out, and I don't know when I'll be back, I'm going to have to try to find somewhere to watch the Belmont.  Shouldn't be too hard.  I'll even go so far as to step into a bar if I have to.  If there's going to be a Triple Crown winner, I want to be able to see it.  Even if not, it's still very exciting, horse racing.  I don't know how into it my friend is going to be though.  He wants to go to a museum.  Not a lot of TVs there, unless there part of some freaky post-modern art installation about the alienation of the human race or some such nonsense.  Maybe I'll bring along my portable radio, just in case.  Haven't seen the new Harry Potter yet, which sucks.  I really want to see it, but I guess it'll just have to wait until next weekend.  Might not be too bad then...probably be less crowded, and we all know how I feel about crowds (and if you didn't, now you do).    As an aside to all of you out there that I owe emails to - don't worry, I haven't forgotten about you.  I'm just very bad about remembering to email, and even worse about keeping in touch.  I always have been...it's like being caught in a vicious cycle:  when I think about replying to emails, I either don't feel like doing it or I don't have the time, and when I do feel like doing it, I am too busy.  That said, now that I've typed it here, it will be on my mind, and you will hear from me soon enough - if you're still speaking to me, that is.  Good weekends to all!
