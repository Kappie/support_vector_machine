It was always interesting to read their blogs but it never before occurred to me to create a blog myself before this.   I previously could not imagine myself writing my thoughts about issues and about my life on any web page. You can say I'm kind of an introvert to an extent. I rather not talk too much about myself to people I don't exactly know well.   But after a while, haha somewhat 2 months back, I started my blog. I don't exactly write anything very personal on my blog (unlike most people). I still strongly believe in having total privacy about what happens in my life. Well it all depends on the person I guess- how much they want to reveal about themselves to others and how much they don't.  Well, anyway, back to my main point... BLOGGING IS FUN! It just feels good to be writing my 14th blog :) No significance to the number 14 but just that its double digit LOL.
