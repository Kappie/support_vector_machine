At least I hope it's Jessica... the blog-thinngy didn't say who it was from...very inconvenient. So, now that I said that... Shall I write a random essay for you? .....I shall cleareth my mind and the topic shall appear *head is cleared* and the topic is....(Dramatic Pause) MARSHMALLOWs!!!! How do they make them, honestly? They're like miracle food, the way they're puffy and yet still chewable. I think white foods are weird, especially the ones that you can  cook and still stay white. I mean, when they dehydrate or water is mixes in,shouldn't they change color? Like turn yellow-ish or brown or gray? White socks, white paper,white walls.Everything ELSE changes color!  They change color whether they're fading or growing dirty!  Food that's white only changes color is if it rots or is dyed (ex.Easter Eggs) And who likes white food? It means no flavor! Like white rice, its nasty until you add the butter and then POOF  yellow + yummy. Marshmallows are good frozen, dipped in liquid nitrogen...Cool....I think I should go now....Look at how much I typed! I think I'll go steal some liquid nitrogen...or play with fire.       -  Fire Emerald
