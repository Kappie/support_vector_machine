Sure, Casey's coming, and that some consolation, but I am still dreading going. It's a hole, i really hate Canberra! So I won't be able 2 blog 4 5 whole days, or go on MSN or nething. The only contact I will hav with the outside world is mobile phone. So everyone who has mi number must SMS me so that I can be saved from boredom! This is my plea to everyone.  Well, today. Today was a pretty boring day. I mainly slothed around and did nothing. Fun Fun. I watched this random movie on Movie1 called  urlLink "Frailty"  about this random family that goes around and kills "demons", actual people who have done nothing wrong, but the father says that they have and that God has given him this list of "demons" to hunt down and kill. It is very random. But it's not that bad actually. Just really creepy.  So overall mi day was pretty average. 'Cept 4 two people, who I won't name (u know who u r) who were being bitches 2 me (1 more than the other, but it was still mean) Doesn't matter if they don't go through with it, it is still mean. And I'm upset that you guys could do that. And thats all I hav 2 say Bloggin off, Beth  p.s 2 see Luke's long john's click  urlLink here  - they r seriously funni and freaky!
