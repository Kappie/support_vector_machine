It's just all so confusing. :S First, there's still Kyle, managing to still squeeze himself in after so long, after so many fights, after so much pain. There is good memories there too thou, and he was my first love after all, how could i leave? Last summer, wasn't like this, i did go out with a guy, but it wasn't just a fling to me, he really meant something to me, first time i ever got dumped too...i was so heartbroken. Time heals all, i no longer question why it happened, i cherish the memories, live and learn. This summer has been really good, i've met some wonderful people, gone on some spectacular dates, came out with a better self-image towards myself. Problem is, i care about each and every person i have met, and each of them are different. However, im not ready to commit to anyone. It leaves some people hurt, thats not my mission, i hate hurting people more then anything. Its inevitable in something like this thou. Sometimes i think i need isolation. Just to sort things out. One more year of high school, and then i plan to move away, then things will be easier. i will be counting down the days until then. i've been working really hard at saing money. If only money wasn't an issue, then everything would be perfect.
