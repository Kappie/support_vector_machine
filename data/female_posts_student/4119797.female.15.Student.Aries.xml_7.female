My mom is crazy, my brother is annoying (note: he IS older than me) and my "dad" lives in a far off land of nowhere-ness. I'm a normal kid and I do semi-normal stuff. I like to have fun and be crazy. I really like taking pictures. Pictures of cool things, not like flowers and shit. I have 3 cats with a collective Cat IQ of 7. I also have a dog, he's inbread so he's a little messed up, but he's still cool. I can't think of anything else to say about myself at the moment.       Today was a boring, slow day. I watched a 10 hour marathon of some messed up show. It was interesting for the first 3 hours but then it just started going downhill. It made me think about the human race and I came to a conclusion. Humans are GREEDY! People will do anything for money. Like what was the last thing you did for 5 bucks? Run down a street naked, eat a worm, make out with your best friend infront of a bunch of guys... This is nothing compared do what these people were doing, not only to themselves but to one another. I know if I made it out of that show alive I would never believe anyone again. There's lies and decieving all at the cost of someone else. These people would go to any length for $100 000, including hurting a lot of other people on the way. It's almost ridiculous. All I can say is the Karma Gods will get those people back... BAD! MUAHAHA!
