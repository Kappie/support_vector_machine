You look at me and do not see You look right through me.  I look at you, my friend, And see I have nothing to hope for in you.  I say to You my Friend, Will You help me up    When I stumble? You answer me, I will guide your steps, so you do not stumble.  I say to You my Friend, Do You see how I have strayed,    grown away from You? You still reguard me as an old friend, And pull me into an eternal embrace.  I look to You, my Friend, And see I have everything to hope for in You.
