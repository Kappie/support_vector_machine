God needed you and took you away from me..i dont really know why..and it was sooo unexpected.. i mean, these things happen..but why.. why you.. so full of life.. such a zest..such a love.. for everything -- even though the past few years i didn't know all your friends personally, i knew them through letters and e-mails and such.. and i know you touched so many people's lives..megs.. i just miss you sooo much - live it up, up there - its truely the beginning of a great new life..watch over me.. my angel - i love you meghan
