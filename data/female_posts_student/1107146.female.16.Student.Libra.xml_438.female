So I woke up early, got distracted by some mags for an hour or two...yes, that was a slight impediment to the plan, and if you knew what mags they were, I would be that much more smack-worthy. But nevertheless...I went upstairs after that, I sat down at the set, I laid it out, and it was, for lack of a better word, and at serious risk of being deemed a poser, DIBBLE.   The song is a year-old conception once called  These Chains . Back then, it was a lot softer and geared toward the wonderful artsiness of  Bitter , but now it's been a bit revamped, it sounds like really old Soundgarden, but...  OMG IT IS SOOOOO L337! I couldn't believe it when I'd finished all the myuzik tracks, it just blew me away. So ass-bad, the only problem is the lyrics...I haven't written any I like. I tried sitting down and writing some, I couldn't, so I gave up and went into some kind of stupor for an hour and laid around and beed a bum, then something got me up and made me record again.  The next one's drums were done in three takes. This song has also been conceptualized for a long time and finally laying it down is a dream come true, even if no one likes it...even I don't like it right now (needs remixing), but it's amazing to hear the idea in the flesh, even if it is a bit retarded in its present state. At least the idea was true to form, that's what counts. So it needs a bit of redesigning, but after that, it'll be one more under the belt, one more towards getting that free stizudio tizime, and one more towards submitting the record to some execs that Alex's dad knows that have expressed at least minute interest in hearing what we have to offer.   The songs, in order of recording, are  Chained  and  New Dawn , by the way, and I'm going to go record another, if I can, in a few minutes...need to run first, else this gut get control of me.  So enough recording stuff, it's more fun when you're hearing watching/doing it anyway...  A point to make...everyone says not eating is bad because it slows your metabolism and will actually make you gain weight. Everyone's heard it and it sounds essentially believeable...it's logical to the biology of humans, anyway. What gets me is...anorexics don't seem to be having this problem. This is also the concept behind the word "starving", and the cartoon conceptualization thereby, where the character will tighten his belt to exemplify he isn't getting enough, if anything, to eat. So w00t, piss on science! This whole paragraph is just a reaction to the fact that I've lost seven pounds in the last two weeks and I have no idea why, heheh.  MTV is an awesome channel. Not really. There was a show on today about having "THE PERFECT BODY", which featured a bunch of prep girls and jocks that did inane stuff to get what they call "perfect figure". There were two guys...one was a bodybuilder, the other was a soon-to-be linebacker for Notre Dame. Then the girl, who was in a modeling convention where, honestly, she didn't stand a chance. One girl said, before the competetion, "I don't think they'll even be judging us on how we answer the questions, it's all about having a great bod, right?"   Right. One of the judges had the audacity to say "it's important that they answer the questions well and without hesitation". Oh, so is that why you made them walk to the awards ceremony in bikinis? RIGHT, their intelligence has a lot to do with that, etc. blahblahblah, and other cynicisms about this "pop culture" shiet.  But jeez, that show is really depressing. No one gets what they're going for...the bodybuilder guy placed third, he needed first to go pro, the girl didn't even place, the linebacker was thirteen pounds too light to match the smallest linebacker Notre Dame has had in the last five years. And the guy weights 280, for cryin' out loud.  The world is really gay, when you think about it. That's why I don't; consequently, this abscence of culture is good fodder for lyrical dissection.  That'll be one of those quotes that people will put in inspirational books for musicans, if not this line that you're presently reading, just because they're smartasses.  Anyway kids...need to go run. You've been an excellent audience as always, if you've made it this far, and if you skipped all the way down here, well, good for you too!  PEACE DAWGZ, AWW W00T.
