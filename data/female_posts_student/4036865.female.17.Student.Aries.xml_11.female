New things for him will be expensive but after that, it'll be alright, im not sure how putting a timer on the light exactly works, but i'm sure that's included in some sort of instructions. i'll put him on the same sleeping pattern as me, well, for school. Other then that i went to the mall and wandered for a while, and played video games, yuppers, its been an alright day. Oh, and the link is a game, a bunch of snippets of video game songs, and You say where its fun, yup, i've spent some good times playing that, good for when feeling bored. i talked to Kyle last night, it was really tough, it took me a long time to actually say something, i freeze up when there something important to be said, i just didnt want to break the news, he held my wrists and yelled until i actually spit someting out, of course he was angry with me, but i think its going to be ok. i'm really going to miss being held, and that sort of stuff. All self doubt and anxieties sink in. i'm feeling alone, like i dont belong anywhere. Things are going to be ok thou, i didnt lose a friend, things will be ok with time, it'll just take some adjusting. i'm feeling inspired, life's a twisted road that we unwind. Yuppers, things are pretty good right now, i just wish someone was online so that i had someone to talk so, i have to work tomorrow, and i'm really not looking forward to that. :( Nope, not at all. Hmm...even then, it should be ok thou. School is starting again pretty quick, and let me tell You, i am certainly not looking forward to that, then i'll have like no time to do what i want, stupid school. Hmph. Well, it's only one more year, then i am not exactly sure what i am going to be doing. Anywayz, i think i should be going :) later, michelle
