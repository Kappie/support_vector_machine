Work was the usual, cept it was rainy and stuff so we kept closing down. We played card games, talked, stared @ the schedule [i'm not working like AT ALL next week] and of course=answered fones, registered swim classes, and took moolah. Brad came by to visit on his break =D bearing gifts [twizzlers] but it was kinda crazy + he hadta get back to workso we didnt get to talk long..=( Alli left around 4 30 and i worked the rest of the night alone, we closed a ton tho cuz of the storms. Oh well..it was okay. Shoulda been fun w/ andrew, kristine, jackie, alex, and robert working..but w/e. Maybe i'm just in a sour mood now and it actually wasnt that bad while i was there. Or maybe im mad that i have ortho tmrw.
