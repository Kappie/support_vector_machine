Just a season removed from the most disappointing campaign in franchise history, San Jose not only bounced back to earn regular-season success and a Pacific Division title, but the Sharks also became the first team to advance from the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, eliminating the St. Louis Blues in five games.    These would have been considered unheard of developments last spring when the Sharks missed the playoffs after being picked by many as a likely Stanley Cup contender. There were significant management changes, with Doug Wilson becoming GM and Ron Wilson the head coach. And the roster got reshuffled in a big way as veterans like Owen Nolan and Bryan Marchment were dealt away. Popular winger Teemu Selanne then left as a free agent. So, no hope for 2003-04, right?   The Sharks sure didn't pay any attention to the doomsayers and in the process authored one of the top stories of the 2003-04 season, and now a new playoff chapter will be added.    The roster changes placed the emphasis for improvement on young players like Patrick Marleau, Brad Stuart and Alyn McCauley. After a rough start to the season and a team meeting, the Sharks got it together and haven't looked back.    "The players deserve a lot of credit," said Ron Wilson. "It is the story of the season that we won't give up."             By: Phil Coffey
