Well.. today that's my feeling..HaiZz.. got a bita flu and then i suddenly wake up remembering.. i havent done studied for the pass few days... Everyone seems to be sprinting and i am stopping.. That kind of feeling really sucks! How i wish i could turn back the time and enjoy my sec sch life... With my frenZ enjoying every single moment.. Mr Siraj had say its like ur end is doomed if u screwed up ur As... Then i feel so lost these few days... Sometimes i dun see the word HOPE in my dictionary... Everyone tell me i can make it.. But.. i doubt myself.. Really feel like gg for a run.. cycling.. Oh yeah.. my promise for ceyi last time.. Actually wanna say i really dunno how to control my diet.. But i dunno wat happening to me.. I eat alot when i get stressed up.. I really dunno how to relieve myself.. Thats the first time i fear something so much.. For O level, u can either go poly or JC... But for As? You only got one choice.. Go University or die.. HaiZz.. life sucks big time!!!
