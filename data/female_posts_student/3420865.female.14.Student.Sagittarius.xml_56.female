(thanks chloe. *tear*)  so then we went back to the bus stop, and waited for...5 minutes. then my dad called me, and said he would pick us up cuz it was kindof too late to catch the bus. so we walked back to galaxy and waited for him...then he drove chloe home, and we went home. it was a good night.  "i really suck at giving directions."-chloe, after trying to explain to my dad where she lives. "yes. you do."-my dad.  "would you shoot me if i started singing?"-me. "no...but i'd throw these nibs at you."-chloe.  "could i have some cotton candy?"-me "oh yeah sure! here, you can choose your own. if you don't like the ones close to you, then this thing spins...oh no. no it doesn't."-girl behind counter, trying to sping the...spinny thing...  "i think we should hitch a ride with  those  thugs."-chloe, everytime a car playing loud music drove by when we were at the bus stop.  "that would be in-tents."-vanessa.  so i think i'm going to the movies tomorrow night, too. cuz it's lana's semi-last day here before she goes to yugoslavia for like...a month. (thanks for leaving me, lana. frik...but have a good time! i love you.)  and that is all.  i want you to ruin me.  kayte.
