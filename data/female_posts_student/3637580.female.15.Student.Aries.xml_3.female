Not to say that ALL the friends I have suck, cause some of them rock majorly, but latley I can't say the same for others. If I have to worry about this type of shit, then I don't think I should call this friendship it's more like making me out to a be a bitch for alot of shit I never did. That's really what the fuck it is...  This week has been pretty damn good. I haven't had to be around my family and that's awesome. But Olivia left for Italy thursday, yes she left me HERE ugh...but she called me before boarding the plane on friday and she emailed me yesterday. This following weekend is July 4th and I have no fucking clue what I'm doing. This is a pointless stupid paragraph but whatever...    As for the "boy" stuff, I guess I shouldn't start writing cause there's absolutely nothing to report. I don't know what's going on like usual, I do know I'm probally wanting more than I'll get, and I think that I'm possibly being let down slowly but I'm not really worring about it cause that's not going to change what happens. Hey I guess theres no reason to give up though..hhmmm i dunno??  Today was Seth's graduation party, I had to watch all the little kids there while the family party was going on, of course I hated every minute of that but I mean I did get paid so w/e. At some point I decided I was way to damn bored so I called Lindsey and made her come to the party. Seth had Derek and Brandon there at first, they invited me and Lindsey to the "after the family leaves" party, Seth got a DJ and had his friends bring some alchy and stuff, we left cause I wasn't about to spend my night with a bunch of drunk seniors...  My night really progressed into nothing. I came home and I've been sitting here for sooo long.  theres nothing else to write if i think of something well then...i'll write it.
