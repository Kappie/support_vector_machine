Right now Simon, Alaina, Mark and Brian are all in Nepal.  There is a market there that is supposed to be very cheap.  Dylon and I opted out of going.  We both have work to do here and I would like to spend my last afternoon here with the children.  Last night the whole team slept with the children in the hostel.  It was a riot.  The girls put on little skits for us, they dressed up as Moses, and Martha and Jesus, and they sang all the songs they learned.  It was too funny.  Really you haven't lived until you've seen a 5 year old orphaned Nepali girl wearing your shirt and walking around with a stick to part the Red Sea.  We had an absolute blast with the oldest group of kids.  It was nice not to have to speak through a translator, and to move from just telling stories to trying to challenge them.  They had to so much energy; it took all of our camp, youth works, and teaching experience to put together a program that seemed worthy.  They responded really well, so I think by grace we did ok.  We get on our 24 hour (assuming all things run on time) train back to Delhi tomorrow.  We are told that it is a much nicer ride as it fits better with one's daily schedule...ie we got on the train in the morning, have fun on the train all day, go to sleep, and when we wake up we should be in Delhi..ta da!  Here's to hoping it goes smoothly and that I don't lose too many card games.  There will be a few things to do in Delhi to wrap up the trip and then we come home.  I think as with any trip of this nature we are both happy and sad to be coming home.  We all share a new love for nation of promise, but we miss our family, friends and familiarity.  I will try and relate some stories when we get back to Delhi.  Lots of Love  Laura  ps, Krista T, if you are reading these, can you send me an email about your wedding, and rehearsally type things, and times and how to get there, 'cause my invite is in Hamilton (i think).....yeah, i miss you and I can't wait till your big day!
