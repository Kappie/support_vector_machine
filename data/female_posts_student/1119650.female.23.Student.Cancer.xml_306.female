We ended up gettign there, but it wasn't a house it was an overcrowded  urlLink Starbucks  and everyone was getting uppity because there was only one person working there.  I got behind the counter and started making lattes like I hadn't left my management position there 3 years ago.    All of a sudden we were running around in a field and one of Petrina's cats was being attached by a vampire.  Note to self: don't watch The Lost Boys right before bedtime....its not gonna end well.
