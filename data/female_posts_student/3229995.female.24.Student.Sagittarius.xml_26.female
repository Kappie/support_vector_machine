A classic Bollywood love story  feutering some of the biggest stars in India. The plot is a typical love triangle, with many and good song and dance numbers, which is the essence of any big Bollywood production.   The film feuteres   the exceptional Indian beauty and former 'Miss World' Aishwarya Rai, which has proven herself as an actress in some big Bollywood productions since the late 90s.      The worst feutere  in this film is the extrem overplay by the male lead Salman Khan, which only has his good looks to play on. Things gets far better when the second male lead, Ajay Devgan, enters the scene and just because Devgan is a far superior actor compared to Khan, you just whish with all your heart that Miss Rai will end up with Devgan.
