I was just visiting my grandparents in Torrance and they suprise me with it (my b-day isn't until Sept. 17th). Now, I know nothing about installing programs, except that you keep clicking "yes," "next," and finally "finish." It's horrible! But, hey at least I'm not completely clueless concerning computer stuff...I know how to blog, right??
