Learning hate is an art, even people who are smart can be caught, can be crushed, can be creamed  Hate has swallowed you whole  Did you think you're in control  Hate you though, hate you spoke, hate you dreamed  All your hate gave me substance your lives are undone  It's your eve of destruction, your hatred has won!   How could it come to pass?  This awful twist of fate How could I hurt you  This madness can't be so  I can't believe it  I never dreamed that any barriers could rise  Or that I'd ever see the stranger in your eyes  Our hearts were hurting both the same  The hurt was tearing up our souls  The fury in us made us blind  We could not see beyond the pain   Ares--->
