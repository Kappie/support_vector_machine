I got accepted for the varsity of the College of Science. Obviously, it is not volleyball but it's basketball. I was so happy that I let out a pretty loud shriek when Sir Nierra showed me the list. I just love Wednesdays!!! It always brings me such a good mood. Don't you just love Fridays? It is the last day of the week (actually school week) and I could get some decent sleep except for tonight, I guess, because I have a training tomorrow morning and it's going to be another exhausting day for me then on Sunday we will be having our exposure trip in Maragondon or at least I'm still hoping we could still come. NSTP sucks!!!! They scheduled our prelims on the same day of our exposure trip and unless they approve our petition to move that test, we have to choose between the two. Of course we have no choice but to pick the prelims because if we don't...we will fail! and who would want that right??? Anyway, I'm still waiting for Jean to come. Actually, we're here in netopia and as usual I have to check my NSTP account but unfortunately I haven't heard anything from my groupmates. Bummer!!!
