Well, we'll discuss the upside to my day before going into the depressing shit. Woke up late again, I headed to Espresso Royale and picked up some coffee for Donald and I. I dropped that off at work and chatted up a storm... well, at least until Maria got there. (depressing point #1). So I left and went to school. I got to 4th hour and restocked the printer cartridges in the media storage closet. (depressing point #2). I finished my painting on the window late into 5th hour, then got a pass to Otwell's class. I did nothing for an hour, well with the exception of arguing semantics with Mrs. Otwell. And before I wasted another hour of my life, I decided to leave. I walked down to the lower lot with Madeline. Thank god Rex seemed to have the day off or something. So I went to Starbucks with the intention of doing homework, I instead wrote more to the movie script. I think I have ADD or something. (depressing point #3). I got pissed after writing the scene with Jocelyn, Natilie, and Bret... it was so sad. It's just one of things that you can see playing out in real life, but it just pissed me off. (depressing point #4). Some bitchy, loud girls showed up and spoiled my mood even more. So I left. I was going to go to work, or home, just somewhere. Then I decided that DDR would change my mood for the better. I played the quarter machine only to be kicked off my some asian guys that broke the Extreme DDR machine. (depressing point #5). So I put the remaining change in my pocket, assuming that parking payment was going to be a bitch. Meanwhile, on my way up the stairs to Forest Street parking structure, some guy, that had been stalking me on the DDR machine yells, "Hey DDR Girl! You're really cute!" In a state of confusion, I looked around assuming he was talking to someone else, but yelled "thanks" when I realized he was speaking to me. I ran... RAN to the parking structure and got in my car. I didn't mean to run. I just ran. I paid for parking then headed to work. Worked, then left early to have dinner with my parents. Dinner was okay. We came back to the house and I played my amusing voice messages for my mom and Tom. I called Andrea and we talked for awhile. We're going to the Senior Skip Day Picnic together tomorrow. (which made me extremely happy) I then decided to go for a drive, realizing that the choir concert was tonight I went to the high school in hopes to see people that I knew. I talked to a few people, then left. Nick understands what happened. (depressing point #6). I came home in a pissy mood and explained my situation to Nick. Now we're trying to find him a nickname... I need sleep. I'm going to die. I need a Red Bull.  *passes out*
