So I feel bad for that, but I'll make sure to stop by and chill with him. If only it satisfied my math credits for college, but no, so I'm stuck in Algebra 3, because I'm too much of a pussy to take Pre-Ap Pre-Cal. And from what I heard from Ritika, my Algebra 3 teacher sucks. At least I only have it every other day and plus I'm a teachers pet, so maybe it won't be so bad =p  Schedule 04-05 1- NorthStars 2- Economics CP (1st semester)/ U.S. Government (2nd semester) 3- English 4 AP 4- Algebra 3 5- Physics 1 6- NorthStars 7- Economics CP (1st semester)/ U.S. Government (2nd semester) 8- Varsity Theatre 9- Anatomy/Physicology 10- Physics 1
