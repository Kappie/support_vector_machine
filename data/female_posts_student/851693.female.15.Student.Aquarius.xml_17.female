I made this pretty stupid mistake of putting "nygh auditorium" instead of "siew may auditorium".. But this doesn't beat a previous mistake when I put the wrong timing on the poster >  About cutting up the tickets, I think anyone and everyone who's free in 'publicity' group should help. So far I think we've got Nicole, Charmaine, Ren Yi and I.. but shouldn't a few more be better? =P Or would too many people be useless? I don't know, I have to ask Nicole/Ms Ng/Charmaine first.   As for the publicity letter, I'll be getting the addresses of the schools from the school websites/moe website, type it in and try and print it out by Wednesday. But I'd have to ask Ms Ng when we're going to the different schools so that I can type it in, unless we'll write it in later (in which case, would we be writing in the addresses too?)  I think that's about it.. I'll update again when I get something else done! ^^ Oh, and I'll go for the next rehearsal (Thursday, right?) to take pictures (if I can borrow the camera from Ms Ng)! Also, keep up the good work, everyone!!
