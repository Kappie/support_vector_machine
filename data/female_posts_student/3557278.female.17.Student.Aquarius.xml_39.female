Ican't let this get to me. It's not worth it.I spose i just have to forget all the crap he said, and not take it to heart. Easier said than done, when it was @#$% like... "ur so trapped in ur own little world where everything revolves around you its funny" or how about... "for sum fuked up reason i actually cared about you" or maybe... "totally different, totally nice and didn't eva look down or shit on ne one, and u actually used 2 be friendly 2 ppl".        All i ever did was help or listen. It's not my fault that you stuffed up or whatever. All this time you've taken out your shit on me. I never had any bad intentions or tried to 'look down on you'. When i hadnt spoken to you i msged you, but you didn't reply. As if you'd talk to me at school anyway, my groupsprob too "different", or youre just too hard done by, too busy acting like a drama queen. How many times had i been there for you?  Well i don't care im not going to be a doormat when you come and want help again. I don't need that crap thrown in my face again.       GOODBYE        ps: i realise its kinda immature saying this on my blog, but i dont really care if he reads this, i just needed to get some stuff straight.
