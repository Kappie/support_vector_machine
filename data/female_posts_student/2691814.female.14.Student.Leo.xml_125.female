Im never going to the bathroom at school again tho...omg...i mean...they totally missed me but francesca will tell you otherwise lol. I got really pissed off tho. But towards the end of the day it was alright. I saw ryans pics...omg i looked so stoned and ya..it was funny and there was one at the dance and he looked like he was having an orgasm lol..and i was infront of him!! haha good times tho. I need to get my pics developed. hmm..what else happend today..oh ya i got best dancer in chorus lol. I was actually suprised. I though ashley would get it but she got it in notables..which is a different class. But...that was cool. Oh ya and our bus broke down so we had to get a different bus and then..when we past our busdriver we all flipped her off. It was funny..but i think we'll be hearing about it tomarrow from her. Oh well i dont care.  Last night i was sad...yup..listening to the beautiful sound of Yellowcard...'Empty Apartment'...haha i told ryan over the phone how to play it 'A,C,G,D,F' lol easy.  well i guess i better be-a going.
