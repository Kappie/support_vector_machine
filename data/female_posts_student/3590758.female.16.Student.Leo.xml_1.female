Today i did the New York State Biology exam, it wasnt that bad, i know i at least passed...but the New York State Global History and Geography exam was sort of difficult, and im not sure if i passed or not...only time will tell! anywho, its almost summer and i cant wait till the last day of my test (this monday and its friday) hah, yey ^.^ Today sorta sucked all together, i had to take my spanish final exam and my bio regents, and i was there from 8:30 to 4 o'clock it was murder in the gym, it was soooooo so hot and i was starving by the time i got out at 4 o' clock. But the worst is over, and the year is done, this year went by so fast. I did so bad this year too, i was so lazy, i didnt want to do  anything . Next year i have to be on top of the game though, it was a sucky experience feeling all stupid and not learning anything. I also hope to get a job this summer so i can splurge and buy nice things.well, thats all i have for today, love and lollipops ^_~
