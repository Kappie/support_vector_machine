Even for someone like me, who has no life to speak of, it's impossible to report on every single slightly significant thing that happens. I'm just going to have to stick to the most significant and/or interesting stuff and leave it at that. If I don't I'll probably end up developing Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. I think. What is that, anyway? Must ask medically-knowledgeable-BF-numero-dos. (I'm just now introducing her. Her name's Henna by the way.)   Okay, so, I'm going to stick to the most important stuff. For today that'd probably be the two disgusting websites I saw. They weren't dirty in a pornographic way, but they were possibly more offensive than if they had been. You can check them out at  urlLink gothamist  and  urlLink ProBush . Seriously. Isn't there enough repressive propaganda hateful crap in other countries without insisting on it in the world's center of 'tolerance' and 'democracy' as well? I suppose that this is the downside of free speech. I know that everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but sometimes the stupidity of Americans shocks me. 'Tree hugger hate mail'? Do they claim that it's unreasonable to care about the environment? As a child with fiercely liberal parents, who grew up picking up trash, planting trees, being a white minority and fixing up houses, it just seems that the selfishness is shocking. As for the other thing; well, that's just part of the fart-jokes category. It's stupid and disgusting and part of that big group of idiotic testosterone humor.   My mom and dad have just come back from a jaunt to Massachusetts. I've been cleaning my room (again) and doing the dishes and now it's 11:14 where I am and I'm tired but I really want to succeed with this. God, am I gonna need a lot of coffee in the morning. Also I had to handle the responsibility of tracking down a tape of  Gilmore Girls  and holding the phone up to the TV set so Henna could hear the  Charmed  finale. Poor girl only gets NBC and CBS. Mmph, anything else? Oh yeah- I had a little misadventure on the roof of my house today. This guy we were renting a room to recently moved out, and his room had access to this roof/mini-porch thing where you could hang out. I wanted to go out there to do homework today, and it turned out that getting out there involved lifting this unwieldy 6-foot-tall ultra-heavy wooden cover off the hole you use to get out there. Considering that it was three stories up in the air and there's no barrier to falling off the roof, I was understandably freaked out. So, yeah. I ended up enlisting my sister's (her name is Summer) help in getting it off. No injuries ensued (and the wooden thing didn't even fall of the roof and smush a cat, as I had feared), but there ended up being earwigs and bird poop, so we abandoned the whole thing. Oh, crap. I've just remembered that the cover's still off. Oh well- I'll fix it tomorrow.   Currently Reading:  Stupid White Men  by Michael Moore. This another case of re-reading for the bazillionth time (not literally; duh). I really need to add some new blood (so to speak) to my book collection. Going to go on a jaunt to Borders tomorrow I think. I have some new books in mind. And don't bother lecturing me on the badness of the corporate bookstore- but I suppose that's a subject for another entry.
