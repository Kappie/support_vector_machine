Also the people at the gas station must have thought I was retarded.  I couldn't get my fuel door thing open, like the nob thing you twist.  So after like a minute I decided that the smart thing to do is ask someone, so I asked a lady and she could barely get it off too!!  But well she was like "you just have to twist, and give it a pull" so yeah I think the guys in the building were like laughing their ass off, but whatever.  All that matters is that I have a full tank now, lol.  Drama was good today, watching Finding Nemo was the highlight of my day.  Mrs. J talking to me was the 2nd highlight of the day.  She is so damn cool, I want to be like her someday.  And well yeah that was my day, and this morning I studied Bio.  Exciting stuff!!  Lol!
