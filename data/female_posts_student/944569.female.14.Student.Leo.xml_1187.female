Tezuka, the captain of the team, has high hopes for him.  It's kind of annoying how Ryoma is pretty much good at everything (bowling, billiards, tennis, ping pong, English and science).  He enjoys eating hamburgers with his pal, Momoshiro, at a fast food restaurant that looks only too much like McDonald's only the symbol is a yellow A after a hard day's work of practice(obviously he persuades his pal to pay for his food).  His favorite drink is probably a can of juice called Ponta (i wonder what it tastes like...).  Allthough Ryoma can be good at tennis and everything, he has one flaw.  He has problems interacting with ppl sometimes.  He can really be an idiot sometimes when talking.  He unknowingly says things that are mean or insulting without realizing it.  I think Ryoma's problem is that his entire life revolves around tennis.  Maybe he should learn about the other pleasures in life as well.  Oh yeah,  his hobbies are playing tennis, eating burgers and trying out new bath salts and stuff in his bathtub (which is coincidentally one of my hobbies too ^-^;;)
