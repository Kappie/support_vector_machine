Mom and I are going to dinner tonight and then just hanging out, going shopping tomorrow.  She is really excited about my new job and I am too. I can't wait to break the news to this crap-ass place. (ECI).  I got into a little baby brawl with Joe this morning - such an asshole. I just hate the way he talks to people in general and so that makes me really short with him. I can't stand him. I don't know how he has made it so far in life with the kind of attitude that he has. Blah blah, enough about him.  Last night I hung out with some friends, had a few beers and just enjoyed one of my last Thursday night in Austin. I sat there at the bar reflective over the 4 years I have spent in Austin - the relatioships I have formed, the friendships I never thought I would make, the career decisions - interesting where we end up after a certain period of time. I always thought Leah and I would be together forever....and then I thought Brian would be my roommate forever.... blah blah.    Jeez, I am bored. I am going to search the net for a little while.
