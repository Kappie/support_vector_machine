That is right Alex, I tried to play a joke on you, but you already know that. I think it worked. You were getting mad. Mad...good. Goodness! That reminds me....I talked to Reggie for a bit last night (well like 1 in the morning online). We probably talked for a good half hour to an hour. I haven't talked to that kid for awhile, so it was fun. We were both in good moods, and decided to spread the goodness. I talked to Marty until like 5 in the morning on the phone...now that was crazy. That would also explain why I woke up at 12:30 today. Amanda would be dissapointed! Oh well. Hmm...I think I've done my job of blogging enough about nothing for now. G'day to y'all!
