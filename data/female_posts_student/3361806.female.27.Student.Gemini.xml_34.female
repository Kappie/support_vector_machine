The meeting took about 1 hour which many interesting points.  I went back to my house and try to figure out the problem (again)  cause I don't want to leave it behind. Then suddenly, I can figure out with no reason .. It's just a format of the files. I should've notice that ..  unix software needs unix file format  Now, I can move on to the next phase with happy feeling ;D  In conclusion, 1. transform original file into the defined format 2. normalized data 3. use rankgene software with data  Next phase, 1. writing 2. GA , KNN  Go Go Go !!!!   Thank you man for the girl style Nike hat :) It looks CooL on Me .. ha ha ha  xxx
