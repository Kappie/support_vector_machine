This contest is made up of players who don't even know they are contestants... and if you want to play you have to make sure you are on the #1 bus when I am and you have to be on somewhere between the Newberry stop and the Throwbridge stop (I think that's what the stop is actually called - it's the one at the intersection of Mass Ave, Putnam and Mt. Auburn) in Cambridge.  The other qualifications are that I have to see you and you have to be... well in all honesty friggin weird or just way cool, but just so you know weird will win this contest over cool any day!  TODAY'S BIGGEST FREAK ON THE #1 IS....  KICKING SINGING GUY I saw you on the bus this morning when I got on at Mt. Auburn around 9:40 AM.  You were sitting in the back of the bus.  I didn't pay much attention at first as I was at a good place in my book and anxious to delve right back in, but you didn't let that stop you... you were determined to pique my interest.  As I sat there and read Digital Fortress I noticed movement out of the corner of my eye.  I remember at this time my MP3 player had begun the live version of In Your Eyes and your movements seemed to be in time with the drums.  I then took a better look out of the corner of my eye and noticed you too were listening to music and your movements, which were becoming larger and larger till you almost hit the woman next to you, were those of one mimicking playing the drums.  I then turned back to my book as I must admit although not always as animated as you I am used to seeing such movements due to my current status as a student at Berklee.  Drummers are everywhere.  I think it was the next part that put you over the top and led you to win today's title.  When I heard the loud singing at first I assumed it was part of my own music as I had turned it up pretty loudly and was very interested in my book, so much so I didn't even consider the sound.  But the second time was brilliant on your part, that flat howling noise you made caught my attention... congrats... it was so obnoxiously off key and so bad that I think I decided I had never heard anyone sing so poorly in my life... but the clincher was that you clearly thought you were the best singer in the world.  But this next part (despite what I might have just said) is what won you the contest... the standing up at no particular time pretending to have a microphone in your hand and jumping with some sort of sound escalating from your mouth (assuming it was singing) and making us all remember that we are glad that Bret Michaels was not only good looking but had a voice on him...   Sing on my freakish friend... sing on indeed!
