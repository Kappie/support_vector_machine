First and second lesson was biology but when it was third period which was maths lesson, Mdm Ng told us that we have to go to the music room asMr Nathan have something serious to tell us. When most of us thought that Mr Nathan wanted us to sing nation anthem or talk to us but never did we expect that Mrs Chua broke the news that one of my classmate passed away. At that moment everyone quiet down. We were shock and I don't believe what I heard. I even ask Jia ying to confirm it. Then most of the girls started crying. And of course I cried. She wasin the same Englishclass as me and we were sitting next to each other. Although we were not that close, we do talk during english class. She was a very good girl although her results are not that good. She was dead on the 19 July 2004. We stay in the music room whole day without having lesson until the end of the school. So sad.....
