Which probably is even more confusing, but I think it basically says that you can't define yourself.  So I think we are all in one of those weird transitional stages because things just seem to be getting so complicated and I know I for one have no idea what I'm here for yet.    Hopefully we'll figure it out soon enough because I'm not really a big fan of identity crises
