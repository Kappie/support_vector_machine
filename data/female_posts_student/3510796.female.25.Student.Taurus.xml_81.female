Take it or leave it.     Dave Matthews Band Tuesday  July 6 2004  Tweeter Center for the Performing Arts  One Sweet World  Best of Whats Around  The Stone  Song That Jane Likes  New Song #4  Crush  Rhyme  Reason  Hmm ? [New]  Warehouse  I Did It  New Song #3  Where Are You Going  Help Myself  Fool To Think  Jimi Thing  New Song #1  Tripping Billies   __________________   [New Tune Tease]  New Song #2  What Would You Say    I hate how, by now, they cant tell 'us' the title of the new songs.  I had them for MY set list, but since I wasnt at these shows, all I get is, New Song #...This comes straight from the road crew.  Dont they know the songs by now.  They play them every damn night.  Fuck it.  Im out.  p.l.dmb.
