Cretia brought me home and we chilled here for a little while, then she left to go to some where. lol. then will came over and we hung out...cought up on some things, learned some new things about stuff.  then momma, daddy, me and nate left to go get jessi.  then we went to eat at mudcreek with will and chase.  lmao "yeah man, dude" lmao! me and jessi came home and went to the square with cretia. we hung out there for a lil while and then we went to the bowling alley to meet dusty! we went and got a movie, then came to my house and watched it till bout 12:15 and then he left...jessi's upstairs in the bed, and Im wondering what the hell everyone's doing! not everyone, just a couple someones in particular. I talked to mack tonight and I really miss him, but Im not gonna do that to myself anymore! Its time for me to stop being the nice one.  I cant let him run all over me anymore like he used to!  to *you*...Im really getting fed up with you saying shit all the time about only wanting to hook up, and about fuckin me over and shit. Im not mad about it at all, but I guess you could say Im scared this is all payback for before! I understand why you would want to do that, but I also dont  understand how you could if the things you say are true.  I just needa know what's going on in your head and you wont let me in on it!     Im really gonna go to bed now b/c I have to call and wake *you* up at 10:30 and Im tired as hell as it is.  I hope this isn't a game for you! I really do hope its not! Yall stay cool! I would say leave a comment again, but Im not sure if anybody reads this, and you cant leave a comment yet cause I dont have a thing for that!
