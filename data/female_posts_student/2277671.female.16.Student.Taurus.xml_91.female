Ok . i kn0w this wh0le n0t talkin t0 markus thing is gettin to me , and im sad and ive stayed sad and people can tell and then i see him and he looks all happy and shit like its nothin to him, which its probably not... and i donno it juss pisses me off to see that it doesnt bother  him ..anyways.. k i'm at home ya know and i'm watchin Oprah and its about this 'sex scandal' where this Black guy [ real cute, honor student , all star football guy] and this white girl had sex. She claims it was rape, he said it was consensual. This happenend in Georgia, you know, the whole 9 yards ppl still fly confederate flags, yadda yadda, real racist people, i know about them, i lived around them, and still do.  So , the case went to trial, the jury liberated 20 minutes, he was found innocent and aquitted of the rape charges but by georgia law, he has to serve mandatory 10 yrs b/c she was 15, he was 18. this law hasnt been used before, just in this case well so he got a 10 yr sentence, i was talkin to my mom about this [ the girl sounded hella fake like she was TRYING hella hard] and i bet you if this guy was white, he wouldnt be in prison right now. Lots of people think that. I know im datin  a black guy, and shit, i know people say stuff about that and they will, there will always be shit about inner-racial relationships...but it doesnt matter to me. California weather is so strange... raining hella hard, then goes to sunny.. then rainy and sunny at the same time and all.. whats goin on with this weather..??  today i got initiated into the CTK the CHUCK TAYLOR KREW cuhz yall kn0w i always be in sum chucks !!! so im in geometry, and theres this guy in here whos like an aspiring writer or something and hes cute.. haha yeah for an older man. well , the rain is so peaceful. Last night i couldnt really sleep, i woke up at like 2 and ate some chocolate. im such an emotional eater... thas y im hacka fat lol.... well Markus still isnt talkin to me, im sad, its so sad it makes me wanna cry and it hurts my feelings but why did his cousin come up to me and say why arent you talkin to him, see i know he was gonna make it out to be my fault. Darryl keeps sayin i should just go talk to him but i cant do that because i always do that and all he does is say sorry and i act like its all coo and im tired of doin that, im tired of talking about this shit so peace!!
