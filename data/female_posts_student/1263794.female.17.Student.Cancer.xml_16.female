I went to the first friday a couple days ago, and unlike most people who were aimlessley wandering around, hanging off of their friends, making their way to the food stands and caught up in their own conversations, I realized I was off leaning on the "wall" with no one but Miranda and we were both just standing there watching. There was just so much going on, conversation seemed unecessary. I found my eyes wandering from group to group and somehow I was just mesmorized. I think I've gotten to the point where I place myself in a busy location just to observe. I just find human interaction so interesting. I mean why do people act the way they do? The concept that everyone is so different, however simple that may sound, just amazes me....... Wow I never thought I would turn into one of those quiet, always lost in thought kind of people, but I think it's happening.
