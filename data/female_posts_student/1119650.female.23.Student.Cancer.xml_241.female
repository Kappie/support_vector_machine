He's 5'10, 240 and has the cutest hazel eyes and curly brown hair (he can grow it into a "TimboFro"!)  Jamie rocks the freaking heazy and he needs a super-awesome, really cool, neato, hottie-supafly girlfriend.  Help him out.  If you know anyone whos interested in his lil monkey ass hit him up with an  urlLink email  or leave a comment.    Anyhow, this is not a joke, I love Jamie dearly and he needs to get laid.  His last girlfriend was a megawhore cheating bitch and so he needs to do better.  And before you all start with your "Oh, Gwen, why don't  you  date him crap, we already dated, it didn't work out, but this kid is my BOY so I have to look out for him.    His musical tastes rock, he always cheers you up, he has a good sense of style, he's funny as all hell and he is gonna work at Walt Disney World™ soon!  So you should get in and hopefully get down with him in Florida!  He would be open to dating a girl at his school,  urlLink WSU  (go Cougs!), but they only wanna date basketball players or they're dirty who-ahs.  Right, so as I said, hook a brova up!   **Also: any other guys/girls looking for a date?? Send me a pic and a quick bio and I'll try and hook your ass up too!  I've made plenty of happy matches in my day...I just can't find the right one for me....so, um, I guess if you think you're the right guy/girl for me you can also email me with a picture and a short bio**
