I sent it out to a couple list serves that I'm on, not really expecting it to get looked at but..." "Well, how about chess... Or chess and not wearing any underwear?"  Sound fair.  Here goes (aren't prompts fun?).   What I postulate is that a chess master who does not wear underwear is more likely to win.  This, I would claim, is based on the fact that anyone who has gone with out undergarments will admit that it gives a certain degree of freedom.  When one has no skivies on, there is a daring anti culture feeling.  This may be subconscious, but it is there none the less.  You are obviously going against cultural norms, giving yourself a degree of exposure, even if it is hidden to all but yourself.  So, you sit down, facing your opponent, ready for an epic battle.  You stare into their eyes, attempting to create a facsimile of a icy death stare, and begin.  You are wearing no underwear.  You are on the cutting edge, a throwback to wild times, an animal.  Animals are able to better tap their instigate tactics.  As the game progresses your tightly bound opponent is constantly baffled at the way you weave in and out of their anally constructed traps.  You dance, float, dodge, role, and in the end back them it to a corner.  This is not merely Chess!  This is a battle to save your young, a battle for food and air, this is a battle for life.  This is the advantage that going bare holds for you.   I feel confident that if scientific studies were done, it could be proven that not only underwear-less chess is more successful, but that in any competitive aspect of life it gives you an advantage... Except possibly some sports... That could just be uncomfortable.
