Outshined  by Soundgarden  Cajun Song  by Gin Blossoms  Pieces of the Night  by Gin Blossoms  Iris  by The Goo Goo Dolls  Dirt  by Alice in Chains  Glory of Sadness  by Rotting Christ  Ira Incensus  by Rotting Christ   And probably not  Little Rhyme , I don't want to wait that long, and I'll probably have a lot of songs by then.
