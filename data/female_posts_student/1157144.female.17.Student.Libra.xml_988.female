Zehner and I are gonna make this really blunt video that basically states how stupid people at our school are because they can't tell the difference between a recycle bin and a trash can, and how disgusting our campus is compared to other schools.  I want to go to the dump and film something there as well as at Branham, and yeah. Anyone up for making fun and lashing out at underclassmen?
