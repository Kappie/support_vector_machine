In the past, Channel 4 provided programming, which appealed to black audiences when other stations wouldn't.  Now it seems Channel 4's ethos has changed and the channel now broadcasts programmes, which promote negative stereotypes about black people (Ali G..need I say anymore).  "Black Like Beckham" was the straw that broke the camel's back as some could argue "Ah leave Ali alone cos it's funny" but the programme "Black Like Beckham" had no redeeming qualities. it was just pathetic.  Beckham's appeal is simple: men like football thus men like Beckham!!!!  Why make it a race issue as if the following is true and Beckham regularly indulges in a curry, will next weeks programme be "Indian Like Beckham".  Me thinks NOT!  I probably wouldn't have bothered to send this email if a programme of this calibre was on at a time it should be (1 am) but it was on prime time television and not once but twice in THE SAME WEEK!!!!!    This leads me to believe that Channel 4 executives felt this programme was either extremely important or believed we all would be happy to see it.  My question is: who is the "ALL". The UK population who like to listen to a little 50 Cent when driving to the town house in the country because it wasn't black people?  I am eager to know why this programme was aired and if it is so easy to air trash on terrestrial TV I'd like the name of a Channel 4 representative as I feel I could investigate why I think the sky is not really blue but a kind of greyish blue.  Hey we could call it "Greyish Blue Like The Sky".  All I can say is thank God for satellite/cable as I refuse to watch Channel 4 until they stop reducing the entire black experience into a rap video stereotype.  www.channel4.com/4later/newform.cgi
