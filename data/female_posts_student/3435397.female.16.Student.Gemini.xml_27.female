I am kind of glad to go because now I will notice the things I hate about some of them is really what I love! I need my space and well I will get it for sure! I am going to miss everyone a lot but hey I will be back on weekends to see you hopefully.  I think I made my decision to not go to YLC and to wait till next year I think that's my idea because this year its my first time on staff, Jackie wants to come out that weekend, its the "X" and my cousin is coming out for his first time and I don't want to break a promise! Alright! So I just wanted to let you all know that ahead of time.   So! Tonight Neil brought by a kitty that we are taking out to camp tomorrow she is so cute her name is Pumpkin and I love her and she is my baby!!! LOL we spent tonight with Taylor and Megan.  We had tons of fun! Taylor put corn rows in my hair which I love! And I look sexy! LOL eh Tay! I have my last final tomorrow and Neil is giving me a ride home to get the kitty after school so Marilyn and I can head out right after school.  So I will be saying all my good-byes at break! Don't worry guys if I don't go to YLC I will be in Regina ONE night a week!:D or in the Fort LOL.  I will miss wrighting and talking to all of you and don't be afraid to leave a comment! LOL talk to you all laters and have wonderful summers.  Later Gator for a while! Erin Wetherill
