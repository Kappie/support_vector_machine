More in a "I can't wait to talk to that gal again, she's fun!" kind of way.  Been feeling distance between us for the first time.  Distance that feels good, which is an unusual place to arrive at.  Whenever the daily thoughts arise about her, I've felt really good about the situation, where I'm at with it all, and very excited about that first conversation.  Not so excited that I'll rush to get to it, because I know I'm not ready for it yet, but just knowing that it's going to be so good to talk and laugh with her again.  Expecting a bit of initial weirdness for a bit, as we tentatively come back into our friendship, assuming the new roles and all.    Hoping she's doing well and this time's been as positive a transition as it has for me.
