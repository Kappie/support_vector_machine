Cos once i decide i wanna go to sleep it takes me about 5-6 hours to actually get to sleep. And once i am asleep, if no one waked me up, i could sleep up to 2 days. So maybe thats possible. Maybe i am just wierd. Yer... Thats probably it. Reeeeeally couldnt sleep last night. I didnt end up going to sleep just cos i was too hyper from the caffiene. --NO MORE CAFFIENE-- . So anyway. Yus i did cut last night but that was to be expected. I did 9 new ones. Onli small ones cos i was testing out my new razor. They were thin but they were pretty deep. They bled looooots.   Hmm... No one ever seems to wanna listen to me. I mean. My friends just dont care. I hate living, breathing, suffering. I hate my friends and family. Fuck i just need to get out. And no one cares. *cries*  --May--
