ZZ Top closed out saturday night and for me not knowing anything about them i would say they put on one hell of a show, and then sunday finally rolled around. i had a freaking blast, and i missed my baby a lot, i was drinking with ryans family, i love his sister to death!, she is freaking awesome. i got bunches of water dumbed on me, then the beer got poored on me. ryans cousin tyler was pretty drunk on friday n was acting weird smacking my ass n shit, i didnt really like that =(. then i danced with him and mel on sunday, he was looking out for me! i'm soo glad i got to go i did have a blast even tho i made ryan feel bad and lied to him about having fun to make him feel bad =( .. i'm too mean. 8 days till i celebrate one year with the one i love more then anything on this entire earth. i'm soo glad that him and i worked everything out and gave it another chance because it is worth it and soo much more. he is my life, my love, basically he is my everything. and some day i'm goin to be his wife =) =). i cant wait ... wellll i'm gonna go to bed since its way way late!!            *I Love You Ryan Scott Everett
