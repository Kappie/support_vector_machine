Wow, the more I talk to people I haven't seen in a long time, the less I'm glad to be back and around them.  People have changed, though they may not have noticed, it's the abscence that highlights the differences in now and last June. I never saw a gradual process, just the 'before' and 'after'. And then there are the people who have stayed the same. And then there are the people who just make me laugh and smile so much that I can't imagine how I didn't cry myself to sleep every night in Japan.
