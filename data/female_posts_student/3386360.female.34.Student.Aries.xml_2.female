I have a feeling I now know what the part of e mail he thought I missed was. Do I have the faith for this ? Goddess above I hope so. So much has happened I do not know if I have the strength to go on.   Ricky's death. The first thing. I feel badly today is the funeral. 4 hours from now. I hope and pray things are ok and that my sister finds peace and that my remaining nefew finds peace.   Tony / Joey. Was this a combination or two seperate things I dont know. Joey's problems with school has taken a toll on me and on him. The stress from school the problems he faces the lack of help that we get. Emotionally it has been a battle feild. Last night Tony snapped. Joey didnt want to be here anymore and left. Tony contenued to have a problem. It was just to much. I feel dead inside. His rudeness and insensitiveness was more then I could handle and I honestly, as much as it hurts, hopes he stays back with his father and does not come back. Yes it will be harder money wise but emotionaly I am not sure it will be so hard. Tony's lack of manners gets to me more then anything. Joey notices the fact Tony pushes people's buttons to piss them off and then gets all defensive saying that he was only joking that we dont have a right to get upset but then he is allowed to get upset and blow up at anyone and everyone for "joking" with him. Last night I told Tony he had three choices. He could straighten up and talk to me so we could figure out what is going on, he could end up in jail due ot his constant parole violations (ie. leaving the house and so on) or he can go back to his father's house and his dad could beat some sense into him. Tony played what he thought was his trump card when in fact it was actually his death card. He told me that "If you send me away you will lose another son" I knew he meant Breck. I went cold and dead inside. He used that as a trigger to hurt me and all it did was make me not give a shit about things I have had to much stress. So when he walked out the door I picked up the phone and I called the police and reported it. After he got back the police showed up. Then he left again to go down to where Joey was. I was called by the mother and I went down there. I was so very proud of Joey though I know he was hurting so much in his heart. He stood up to Tony and said "I've taken crap from you for to long and I wont take it anymore" Bless my little one for having a backbone. Tony still was being a prick. He came home and did the first smart thing he did all night. He called Elaina and asked her mom if he could stay there for the weekend. YAY. he's out of the house. As soon as he was gone I was able to take a real breath without thinking I would lose my temper. In stead afterwards Iwent into my room and cried. I can not deal with this pressure anymore. I love Tony but I can not live with him.  I can not live with the wanting things his way or no way and when he doesnt get his way he throws a fit.  I live in fear and I cant deal with it. Tony views himself the man of the house, no other male to stand up to him and I have no one to lean again when I am scared. Joey will be visiting David this weekend. Thankfully he will have a break. I may very well ask Dave to take me to the beach if it contenues to rain. If it lets up I will ride the bus. I need to get away.   So was Joey's issues with school the third ? or is Cole not coming back the third. Things run in sets of three. So close to the end of the month, no email from him, no call as of yet nothing. My heart is breaking and I need to feel weak I need someone to hold me and make it ok for me to be weak for a short time. I need this cup within me to overflow and empty so that I can be strong and deal with things again. I know the thing with Tony has not ran it's course. We still need to talk and figure out what he will do and what choice he makes. I am lost.
