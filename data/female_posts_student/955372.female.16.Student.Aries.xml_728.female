THANK FUCKING GOD!!!!! oh my god in camp today they had this little like talent show thingy, sad as that sounds it gets worse (or better depending on your view). This little kid Riley, who was like a transvestite last year, and still has drag queen qualities now, i.e. girls shirts, well anyway he did an act, and *breathes to keep from laughing hysterically* he sung that song from the lizzie mcguire movie (YES I SAW THAT EFFING MOVIE AND IT WAS AMAZING) ya know "hey now hey now, this is what dreams are made of" and he just repeated that over and over again. It was freaking amazing. If he wasn't such a brat he'd be my hero. This new counselor thinks that he's a girl. I choose not to correct her.
