Well, I was quite happy 2 know that IGSSA Gymnastics was  not  on this morningsoI got 2 sleep in until 7.30!! Wow, it was great!!So I got a lift in with Casey. And this is where the bird incident occured. Ted was speaking on the phone and the bird hit the windscreen and we all started screaming. Shows that you shouldn't speak on the phone while driving. Poor birdy. It was horrible. :( So I got 2 school, very reluctant 2 be there, but happy 2 see mi friends!!! I had totally missed them!!! Mi group found out about Luke pretty quickly, they started writing funny and silly poems about him that they hand-delivered 2 me in CCH. Let's just say we won't share them. :P Hehe. But the classes totally sucked. It was cold in history. And I felt sick most of the day. It might be because I didn't have much 2 eat. That happens sometimes. I was bored. I'm worrying about assignments. I have 3 already. School is ridiculous.
