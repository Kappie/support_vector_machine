Ra Ha Ha Ha! I start tomorrow.  The benefits of this job: 1. It will give me legal experience 2. It pays...well! $12/hr. 3. I can stop twiddling my thumbs during my days out of boredom.  The negatives: 1. It is about an hour commute each way. 2. The guy is a bit of a goof.  Will keep you updated on how it goes...
