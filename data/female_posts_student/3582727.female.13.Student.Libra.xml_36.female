It was nice because Megan's mom left us there alone while she shopped for around an hour, so we could talk for awhile. Megan had to go to a volleyball camp that she is in after lunch, so VW and I went to her house. It was a  beautiful  day outside, so we sat around in her driveway talking for most of the afternoon. I spent the night there. Today Katio joined us at VW's house, and we had a shaving cream fight (read: we mostly slathered shaving cream all over ourselves since the canisters didn't spray very well). What a crappy idea. I had a ton of it in my hair (which I admit was an incredibly stupid thing to do), and that made it really disgusting afterwards. I've already taken two showers since I got home around five-thirty, and my hair's  still  a mess. Plus it took a long time to clean up VW's driveway. We're never doing  that  again.  So, I've had a relatively busy couple of days. At the beginning of the summer, VW and I hung out just about every day, but for mostly all of July I've just been hanging out at home by myself. I really love being alone, but it was nice to see my friends again (I hadn't seen Megan all summer, I don't think, and it was good to see her before she left for New York, where she'll be for the rest of the summer). But now I'm back and as lazy as ever.    A packet from school came in the mail yesterday. Unlike in sixth and seventh grade, eighth graders are not divided into houses, so there wasn't much to find out from the packets. All I know is my homeroom, which I fortunately share with Megan, and a list of teachers (not necessarily mine). We don't get our actual schedules until the first day, which is the twenty-third, so I won't know until then whether I get classes with my friends or not. I'm excited. I don't really want summer to end, but I'm always happy about the first day of school.  Tomorrow I'm going shopping for school supplies, and hopefully clothes as well. I'm not really big on clothes shopping or anything, but I like to have new things to wear when school starts. Not that I actually plan an outfit - I think that's silly - I just like new things. Mmm. Anyway, I also like new things when it comes to school supplies. I don't know why, but I love them. New notebooks and pencils... Ah, happiness. And I'm going to buy a messenger bag for this year instead of a backpack, on which I will pin the "Some village in Texas just lost it's idiot" Bush button that VW so generously gave me. Thank you, VW.  I've joined a team blog called The (Informed) Youth of the Nation. We've just started it, but it should be about politics and the like. I'm rather excited about it. Check it out:  urlLink informedyouth.blogspot.com .  Well, I believe that's all I have to say, and my self-imposed summer bedtime is nearing. Remember, I really do love comments and chatters, so if you want to make me happy, please post one of the two, preferably both. And if you do not want to make me happy, do it anyway. G'night.
