First I was really shocked because there wasn't a name on it so I wondered who it was from. Jyan joked about it being a bomb, but I still opened it ~  When I did it was a birthday present from Sam ^^/ KinKi Kids CD !! The newest one ^o^ Koichi looks so good on it !! *looks at CD and drools* haha XD Yesterday was such a tired day ! I cleaned my whole room out so the stupid painters can go there today >.
