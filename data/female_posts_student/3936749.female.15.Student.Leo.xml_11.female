Im scared.   Guy: No this is fun.   Girl: No its not. Please, its too scary!   Guy: Then tell me you love me.   Girl: Fine, I love you. Slow down!   Guy: Now give me a BIG hug.   -  =Girl hugs him=-   Guy: Can you take my helmet off  put it on yourself? Its bugging me.      (In the paper the next day)   A motorcycle had crashed into a building because of brake failure. Two people were on it, but only one survived.The truth was that halfway down the road, the guy had realized that his brakes broke, but he didn't want to let the girl know. Instead, he had her say she loved him  felt her hug one last time, then had her wear his helmet so that she would live, even though it meant that he would die.If there's anyone you love this much on here or in real life, re-post this.      you all should know the reason for me posting this but i do also thinks its really sad and the guy is some like the one im with i think and i love him so much
