KAYLEE, I AM PULLING YOU OUT OF DANCE COMPANY!!" turns out it was my brother who just got a call from my studio and they said i missed the company picture. so, my mom hits the gas to goto the studio to bitch out my instructor cuz she didnt know that the dance company had pix earlier than the rest of the studio. so, we pull up in front and i we run in and everyone's in costume posing for a picture and kathryn (my teacher) shoves my costume in my face and yells "HOLD IT!! KAYLEE'S HERE!!" so, i run to the bathroom and change, leaving all my clothes in the middle of the floor, run over to the group, and someone puts a white hat on me and my hair was up in a bun cuz i didnt know our hair was supposed to be down, so i look like i have no hair and i look totally out of breath, but yes, im in the company picture...lol  our summer show is in 2 weeks and we're not done choreographing half of our recital pieces! they're trying to throw together 2 more routines at the last minute and it's not gonna work. i can't memorize choreography that fast so im gonna look like a fricken retard...lol! we're supposed to have these hot red-and-fishnet costumes for one of our dances, but either they havent come in yet, or they didnt order them. ill be pissed if they didnt order them cuz, first of all, we payed for them, and second of all, it was my favorite one!! lol...they look like something people would wear in the movie  Chicago ...its hot, lol   we performed 'a midsummer night's dream' on thursday night and turned out way better than expected...major props to martin, josh, and tanner who really made it hilarious!
