Anyways, today was pretty funny. Nothing good happened till about sixth period, Spanish. Senora goes, "Well you know my sista, you know the one who is out to aget me." First of all, what the hell does that mean?! Then she goes, "When I went to Costa Rica over the awinter, we went to the abeach, and she atried to smoke. I said 'Why are you acting like that? You are not asophisticated!' And you know ladies, oh you are all so abeautiful, but when I was ayoung all the agirls would you know smoke in the bathroom. But it tasted so disgusting. I told them, 'Why whould I waste my time hanging out in a bathroom?!' And when I was in acollege I went to a party and they were smoking marijuana. But God gave me a natural high, so I don't have to ado that stuff." OH SENORA! And Sam kept saying she was adopted, even though her mom is her real mom.  So chapel consisted of yet another honor code meeting. Well, I was sitting on stage, and guess who appears in one of the doorways. SALZAR MY NEMESIS! See, she told me in golf that I was useless, and hopefully would "find [my] niche someday." Hey Salzar, I'M NOT THE ONE WHO IS 8,075 YEARS OLD AND WORKING AT THE SAME SCHOOL, AFTER THEY ASKED ME TO STEP DOWN FROM MY POSITION BUT I WAS TOO STUPID TO GET THAT THEY WANTED ME TO GET THE HELL OUT, BUT INSTEAD I AM TEACHING FIRST GRADERS TO HOPSKOTCH AND JUMP ROPE. YOU ARE RIGHT I AM USELESS, UNLIKE YOU IN YOUR STUPID PURPLE JUMP SUIT. p.s. DIE! So I saw her there, and I could tell she was wondering what I was doing up there, and I glared at her for like 5 minutes to let her know, that yeah I can't hit a ball, and yeah my snacks will never be as good as Kacey Ording's, but LOOK I'M NOT USELESS. Anywho, Health was really funny. I thought the knocked up chicks would be there, but they weren't. But it was still funny because half way through the woman goes, "shocking" JUST LIKE TRISHA. The whole class just stopped and then burst out laughing, I mean it was EXACTLY like Trisha does it. SO WEIRD! Then we learned that some guy raped a 5 year-old because, "she was coming on to me." EWW sick I know. But then Uli goes, "it's like the baby's at my breast so I better give it milk." It was really funny.  So tutoring. Well, I drove and I'm really bad and I kept doing a creative dance to the music, Something Corporate of course. This obnoxious kid sat with Elizabeth and kept saying I had yellow teeth. Little brat. Well the problems they had to do were really difficult, but Libby taught me a lot. Then we played this circle of life type game. Everybody had an animal: grasshopper, mole rat, or hawk, and then you had to eat whatever was below  you on the food chain. We were all grasshoppers and we had to hop and our boobs were flying! AHH Then Darius says to Meghan, "I'm gonna eat you" and I was like... "OOOH kinky" and he goes "I'm gonna eat you too!" AHH it was really funny.  When I got home I was really excited because Googly (aka Oswald/Ozzy/Google, my cat) welcomed me home and he's really cute. Now I'm just really excited for the OC and for tomorrow: J REV WITH MEG! It's gonna be kick ass, cause we're getting Cosi and the spinich and artichoke dip is SOO GOOD! But it leaves my breath really nasty, and I am worried because "I'm gonna be shoving my tongue down people's throats" at the conert. I said that to Meghan, it was gross. My feet smell... RANK! AHAHAHAHA! BYE
