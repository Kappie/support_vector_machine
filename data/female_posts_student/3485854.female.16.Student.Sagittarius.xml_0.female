We have been informed that the Arabs do not like to be called "towel heads." The item they wear on their heads is actually a small sheet. Effective immediately, please call them "little sheet heads." Thank you for your cooperation.      So what's new in the world? Life's a bitch and then you die.(or in a guy's case, then you marry one.) Leah called me...Emily called me.... Yay! I feel loved, but still haven't heard from Danny. Every time we have a break or something he doesn't try to get a hold of me and then tells me it's because of his grandparents or something later. But when I call him, I can usually always get a hold of him. Go figure. Okay, I'll quit bitchin' about this subject and move to a new one.        Thanx K.E. I'll be sure to visit your site. Emily was telling me you had started a site. Guess what, I rememberd my name this time!! lol. Thank you guys for your comments, I like having some contact with the outer world other than people I pay bills to and people at the shithole I work in.  You know, If you guys ever have anything you want to ask about, start any type of discussions or debates about, just say something in the comments you guys leave. I love the feedback. I've thought about a few topics, but I think I'll wait for someone to throw some interesting material I can work with.         Joke for today:     What did one lesbo frog say to the other?  Wow, we really do taste like chicken!!!
