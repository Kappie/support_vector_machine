I finally got the Christmas stuff down, and I feel good about that, but now I need to go back to Davis and get my room together and go grocery shopping. I'm also thinking about dying my hair darker. I'm getting tired of mid-color brown hair again. Oh well. Got to go, I'll probably type more this evening, though I doubt anyone really reads this at all!
