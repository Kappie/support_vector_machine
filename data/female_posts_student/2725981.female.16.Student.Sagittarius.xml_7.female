Sleeping in, water polo, hanging out and video games. My dad has dutifully decided to put us to work, giving us a few hard tasks to complete in our backyard...which we have begun to remodel. The plan is to level our hill, and put a deck at the top, with a staircase that leads from the bottom of the hill to the deck. There will also be a small path that winds around the backyard and eventually joins the stairs. IN addition, my dad want's to build a gazibo at the staircase's entrance and a few ponds and waterfalls throughout the whole shabang. There will be a bunch of flowers and ferns and quiet possibly trees that add the color and sence of peace to everything. We're still ripping everything up and pulling it to the bin thats been parked outside our house for about a month. Its alot of damn work.  But thats not the last of it. In addition to working on landscaping, we're also working on tidying up. CLeaning out the garage and all our drawers for torn or tight clothes as well as things we haven't worn in three years to give to charity. We've also torn out the playset on the side of our house and my dad presure-washed the deck and is in the process of sealing it. We've torn out the rotting flowers and most of our pine trees, and my dad build a huge planter box and installed several trelaces around our house. We made a new tabletop in our backyard that is hooked right under our kitchen window and we're putting a mosaic on that. My dad has also spent the better part of last week fixing the pool filter, which, unbeknowest to us has been brocken before we ever owned the house and that was ten years ago.  So, although this sounds busy, none of these tasks are finished. Theres still tree and bush branches that need to be brought down from the hill, the mosaic hasn't been completed, neither the painting on the side of the planter box. The planter box has no plants in it, and none of the trelases are nursing any vines right now. The boxes of toys and clothes and sheets have not been given to charity yet, so the garage isn't clean. But we're working on it, we really are. Monday I've sworn to paint the box, and hopefully the trees will be done by Tuesday afternoon. My dad's girlfriend has taken over the mosaic and we went to a few nursery's today to look for vines. My dad has also talked to a contractor and a landscaper about the whole mess.  Other than that things have been peachy. Becca's constantly an ass, and it seems that somewhere I royally pissed her off and now shes carrying the grudge. She thinks that she owns the world, and whatever she says goes, and there's no talking her out of it unless dad comtributes his two cents in our defence. But whatever, to each their own and as long as she stays clear I think everything will go along swimmingly.  I went driving today, first time on the freeway and not half as bad as I thought it would be. I dont know what all the fuss is about. Hopefully I'll have my licence in a month, but I'm not sure...I still need to take two out of three driving lessons with an instructor and the place I took my first lesson at is just trying to rip me off. Maybe that's waht I'll do today. Hmm....
