Next year, I am taking an independent study with my choir teacher and she told me to download this program and get familiar with it so when I'm helping her with the 5th graders next year, I know what I'm doing. It's actually really cool!! You compose music on this program. It's so much fun!! I already composed one song, it's not that great, but it's a start.   Tonight was my little brother's first baseball game. So I decided to go see him play in that tonight rather than going to Wednesday night church. The umpire there, well, I know him and he's kind've, well, annoying and I actually went out with him two years ago and he was going out with someone else at the same time (without my knowledge). But yeah, anyway. He was a really sucky umpire. I mean sometimes some of his calls were so bad. So I complained a lot. It was kind've funny actually. I mean I know a lot about baseball having played softball for about 10 years and watching the Indians since I knew what baseball was, so I was highly disappointed. *tut*tut* But my brother's team ended up winning 19-10. Since the owner of a dairy bar nearby has a kid on the team, she said that if they won they could get whatever they wanted from the dairy bar free of charge, and even if they lost they would be able to get a junior cone. So we had to take Doug home, but he came with us the the dairy bar and we all got ice cream. Then we dropped Doug off.   We stopped at Hawley's because my mom thought they would have a brownie mix for me to make for our picnic tomorrow, BUT they didn't, so I just bought some Archway cookies, hopefully my friends will understand. So then I got home and finished composing my song. And I am DEAD tired. ONE MORE DAY. I cannot wait for it to be over and I can finally sleep in!!!!!!!!!! I am going off to bed before I fall over right here right now...*snore*
