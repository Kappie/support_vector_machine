My unattached unboyfriend seems to be fading.  I hope not.  He didn't call yesterday, and I while waiting by the phone, hovering as it were, pulled a Bridget Jones and drank a little too much red wine in the process.  I think the theory intially was to stop when he called, but as he didn't I felt no need for cessation.  How did pink become a female color?  Why was blue the requisite color for boys?  Who decided this?  I think I will stick with my standard operating procedure black from now on.  I have been called psychadelic, techno, etc today.  Other girls that wear bright shit daily get no scoff.  But I am somehow the marked one.  I wear one bright dress and now I am an Austin Powers sidekick.  Negative Ghostrider, the pattern is full.  Am I the only person in the world who has not seen the third Lord of the Rings?  I hear its awfully long.  Why wasn't the Hobbit ever made into this epic series?  Sorry Bilbo.  Hmmm I wonder if the author was being funny calling him Bilbo, sounds an awful lot like dildo.  Haha.  Sorry, I digress.
