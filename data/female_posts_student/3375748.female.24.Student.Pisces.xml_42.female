I thought I could get a new pair just right there, but they have to order from somewhere and it takes 5 days!!!FIVE DAY!!! That means I have to wear glasses for 5 days!!! I don't wanna!!!! I look so ugly with glasses!!! But, what can I do. They told me that they have to order a special kind contact lenses because my they told me that my left eyes shape look like a football and it need some special kind contact lenses. Well, 5 days without contact lenses shouldn't be so hard! Huh.. Can't go waterpark before I get thecontact lenses. I amso not lucky withall those park thing.    昨晚，我的隐形眼镜被敏给洗掉了！！！那是我唯一的一付，好伤心！今天一大早我就去买隐形眼镜。本来以为没有什么特别的要求，当场就可以拿到。结果！！我居然要等上5天！我的天哦，5天呢！这5天我都要带眼镜才可以。可是，这一切都是我自己的错，谁叫我自己小时候没有好好保护眼睛，现在却需要高科技的扶持过日子。可能人都是这样，拥有的时候觉得失去了也无所谓，结果失去了，才知道原来好幸福。不过怎么说，这5天都必须成为丑小鸭，等到隐形眼镜来了后，在变成天鹅好了。
