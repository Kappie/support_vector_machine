October is almost upon us so as one last outdoor spooky outing we should do something fun, like go to Six Flags for Fright Fest. (insert spooky werewolf howl here)   Im thinking Saturday October 25th and aim to be there around 2-ish and stay for a while.  Tell everyone you know, 'cause I didn't know many email addys to invite people, but it should be hella frickin' fun.     I hope at least some of you will come and if you bring one coke can between two people you can get half price admission (well 2 for the price of one but you'd split that price of one so its half price).  Also we can prolly work out some sort of carpool to get down there so let me know if you want in or not.      >^..^
