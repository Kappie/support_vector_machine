What a blast!!! I had so much fun being totally off the wall and crazy. Leslie- girl you are just too much!! Hooking me up!! How funny is that???? Salvador was so awesome but they only got to play like four songs since the conference had run so long.. how sad is that???? Oh well, at least I got to see them! Did I mention they are the greatest Latin band like ever??? And Mario- I promise it's all about the music!! Tee hee. Anyways, this week has been pretty slow so far... lots of things are going on and I'm just waiting to see how it all will turn out. God give me some patience!! I really need your help right now, lol! I'll let yall know when more interesting stuff comes up.. I think that's really all for right now. Later yall....
