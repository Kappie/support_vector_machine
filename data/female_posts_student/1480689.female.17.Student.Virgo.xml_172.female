There are people that I have reconciled with, and some that i have, not consciously, "broken" up with. There hasn't been so much drama, IN SCHOOL anyway, as there was last year, and that was refreshing. My classes, towards the end, were mostly bitter. We all wanted to get out of there, Spanish and Algebra Adv. especially. My favorite teacher was Ms. Krajco, hands down. She's just such a wonderful person. And she hated Brandon, which was a plus. My least favorite class....probably Spanish. bad classroom, bad teacher, bad chemistry among some of the students. If i would have had a different teacher, I would say Photo was my favorite class, but Cossette....is a dumbwhore. Although that class gave me the oppurtunity to get to know Erin better....:-/ hm. I'm still really confused on what happened two days ago Erin. sorry again.   Spots, was one of the best and worst times this year.....and it's gonna go down next year as well. I can proudly say, that I was on Spots the "first" year it happened. And I got to meet and get closer to a lot of people I probably wouldn't have had the chance to. It gave me something to do after school, something to both enjoy and hate, as with anything you do. I'm gonna say 80% love, 15% hate, 5% not caring at all. I liked everyone in it, Especially Ryan Wilson, who I'm going to miss seeing in the Halls terribly. Him, Tyler Davidson, and Tim Haase, who alrady left Craig to go to Parker, but is also grauating this year. Those three, oh my....heartbreaking. They are amazing human beings, with beautiful hearts and open minds.   My best friend, started home school at semester, which was hard for me to deal with at first, but it turned out ok....Until she decided to live with her mother in hawaii for 3 months. :-( sad. I miss her, considering I was planning on hanging out with her all summer, but heyyyyy it's ok, It's just getting me used to how it's going to be after senior year....oh I'm not even going down that path.  Geoff, Geoff, Geoff....I started this school year with him...we broke up....."remained close" and if I even tried to explain the fucked up relationship I had with him....I'd probably break down. He left the country on Febuary 3rd I believe....for a year and  a half. And I wish he could be somewhere safer than Iraq. I needed emotional time away from him. I can't talk to him right now, because although he's "changing for the better" like he's said to me a million times before, I've reached my breaking point with that kid. Hopefully, I'll be able to calm down enough to be friends with him again, but for now, I can't without getting angry tears....  But I have mellowed out. I have grown a lot. I have matured. And I am learning how to stop being such a baby. I am emotional...that won't ever change...but I'm taking more things in stride and keeping my cool much more than last year, when i was an emotional wreck.   I would have to say, that Mike....was my most significant "thing" or "period" of this year....And still is. He and I connected in a way that I haven't found with anyone else. On weird things too. We both have one dimple, on the left side of our face. We both broke our right wrist, in the same spot, and it was a hairline fracture. He has lived everywhere...and we both moved to Janesville within 3 weeks of eachother. The first song I ever heard by Bright Eyes, "The Calendar Hung Itself" is the same one he heard. Same with Azure Ray, The song "Displaced". its the dumb things that no one else in the world cares about except for the two of you. because i know no one else cares! and then we broke up.....in Febuary...it was one of the hardet break ups. And I was told that he slept with someone a week and a day after we broke up....apparently....he didn't which was told to me like a month ago.....but where's the trust now. It was hard, especially, when I actually saw her like 3 weeks after finding that out. It was the hardest thing to sit in a room, with someone I thought touched Mike...b/c they weren't together, nor did they date. But...even knowing that they only "fooled around" I still look at her as the biggest whore....e-v-e-r. and we basically broke up because we fought A LOT and because of Chris, who I am currently dating.  He treats me like a queen...and yet....I miss Mike. I am, so easily taken....no....I forgive and trust those I care about very easily. And Mike is now being who he was when I fell for him. Chris...is so clingy and touchy-feely a-l-l t-h-e t-i-m-e. He says I love you like 4985398753455093859034534 inthe short period we hang out. And it gets old, real fast. There is a line between sweet and annoying, and he crossed it. At the same time, he is the nicest boy..ever. Every girl should want a guy like him....just a little moreassertive. He's like a puppy....that follows me everywhere. I walk into the kitchen. he's right there. I walk back to the living room, and he's right behind me. I go back to the kitchen to get a freaking glass of water, where's Chris? RIGHT THERE. I mean c'mon.   Dances:  Homecoming. oh my god. I got a kidney infection, most likely from having sex. :-/ but Mike cared for me that night, in my bedroom, since I couldn't move. I had a migrane, i was throwing up, my kidney was throbbing, and i had a fever of 104 that night. He spent the night getting me water, rubbing me down with a cool washcloth and making sure I didn't die.. :-/. the next day, my temprature shot up, and i went to the emergency room. my temp reached a dangerous 106.5..but he came in and calmed me down.   Prom. fantastic. :-) group: Chris, Me, Nate, Bri. Duck Inn, Filet Mingon. Made court whee!! Didn't get queen aw. A little disappointing, but the dance rocked! then us four went back to the room chris rented at the baymont and chilled till about 2:30. then Chris and I passed out. yup. we slept. on prom. heh. i think it's funny. so then I get up the next morning and get ready for breakfast with Bri and RICK!!!!! we went to Parkside, on Milwaukee......that's the name of it right? anyway, belgium waffle with strawberries and whipped cream, I downed it in like 5 minutes. Delish. The rest of the day I with Chris.   I also changed jobs. I now work at Hallmark...because Sam Goody closed. damn. It wasn't the best transition, but hey, it's a job. I miss Sam Goody, or any job that would actually be enjoyable to go to....damnit. It's alright though.  I got drunk for the first time this year. 12 shots of UV Vodka. I don't like being drunk.  I don't think this year has been too bad actually. a lot less emotionally draining than last year, and a hell of a lot more fun. The friends I made, the late nights at Bri's, being able to just d-r-i-v-e. Sharing myself with others, and learning to not hate myself so much. Learning that I'm worth much more than Geoff ever let me think, and being thankful that I had people to tell me that. I'm learning, slowly to love myself.
