I left messages as he told me to call an hour later, and if he wasnt there to call 30 min. after that. I left him messages. And then called again at 10:00 and 10:30. And he calls at 1:40am? Whatever. I dont care, no point to be upset, it doesnt matter. If he wants to talk, he'll call me. If not, he wont. I'll get over it. *sigh* Life's a bitch.
