But it was ok , there was re-test , scheduled on March 4th . n evry nite , without fail again , i prayed to the Lord for him , with all my sincerity n faith , i prayed tt he wld pass . But , he .. failed . Ever since then , i lost faith , I did not believe in what i believe in .   I guess im reali his jinx .
