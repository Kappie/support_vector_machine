Hilarious. high points:  annie jezo being a slut.  steven being satan.. ("SATAN!!!!!...forgot his gameboy..") classic.  erin prancing around stage with dasies and acting...i think like cheri oteri from SNL.  erin dropping her flower basket under the stage.  JAY FALLING INTO THE STAGE TO GET IT! OH YEA!!! i love that man.  having a dance in follies. I suggest you don't do it every year, but it was awesome!!!!!!!!  jordan jackson?????? :-D    then after that we went back to mikes. it got better at his apt, cause sean was mellow there, whereas he should have been shutting up at perkins. guh, and just when i was mellowing out, who shows up? AMY!!! aka CONSUELA! I'll be fine eventually, but friday wasn't the "ok" time.gr....that angered me, but then i got all protective and territorial over mike, couldn't help it. :-/ i just....don't like her.  so i went home...and slept.
