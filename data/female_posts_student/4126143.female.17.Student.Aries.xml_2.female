But thats a movie...and we live in reality..rarely do u see that kind of love/compassion for each other these days. I see love in its truest form in older married couples. They've stayed by each others side for so long they can't imagine life w/o the other..Couples that have been married 40+ years..Who else can love u more than ur best friend..thats what it basically comes down to! I remember when my Grandpa was alive (passed away January 23,2004) he would always carry my Grandmas purse when they were out. Even tho it was huge and full of stuff she didnt really need..but wanted with..he was holding it for her cuz she couldn't..When i would see this i'd always think to myself.."thats what i want when I'm older, someone to care for me the way i saw them care for each other." It prolly doesn't mean as much to u as it does to me..But that reminded seeing this movie made me think of them..If u see the movie u'll understand what i mean about how older couples cherish each other...
