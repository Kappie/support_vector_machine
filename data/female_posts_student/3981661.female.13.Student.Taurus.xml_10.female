Today I got another Tokyo Mew Mew book (:D) Its the third one. It rocks. Ichigo turns into a cat and gets taken home by Masaya (her crush)!! And at the end they finish it with Ryou leaning forward to kiss Ichigo!!!! I WANNA KNOW WHAT HAPPENS!! I NEED the fourth book. Right now. I hope Ichigo pushes him away so I can have Ryou allto myself. Bwahahaha.     Hmm what else happened today. Not much :P. Oh, its the last day of school. But that doesn't really matter to me right now. ^_^        My fat cat was sick this morning. She ate her breakfast too fast xP. Ross (my brother) chased me round the kitchen with one of those mops where it sprays stuff when you push the handle. Apart from that, not much has happened so far.        Oh, we're gonna see spiderman 2 tonight. That'll be fun. Hopefully. ^_^        Well, I better go. Takeshi's castle is nearly on the Tv.        Seeya!!     loooooove Zen xxx
