We saw lotr, again. *gasp* Yeah so her dad is like driving us there and i found out that we used to live in the same house on west second street. Well not at the same time obviously. He lived there in like the seventies. cool stuff. So then we go to the mall for a bit before the movie starts. We got pretzels and sat in these chairs that like "massage" you. aka it feels like someone is sitting inside the chair molesting you. It's really creepy actually. Laurel told me about orange chicken. Sounds... twisted. it's like two random flavors put together, orange and chicken, its like making pizza flavored marshmellows. eeeewwww. Yeah to then we went to the movie. It was great. We laughed through the whole thing. During this like dramatic part laurel is like slurping her soda, ya know like trying to get the very last bit at the bottom. "and i'm like way to kill the drama, 'NOOO'*slurp slurp*" she was laughing for like ten minutes and i'm like "shut up!" It was funny. There were like a total of eight people in the theater, including us. woo, good times. So then laurel calls  her dad and we're like waiting for twenty minutes for him to pick us up. while we're waiting laurel is talking about her pretzels and she goes "they're cold" and i'm like "and pretzely" and she's like "OMG i was gonna say that!" freakAY.
