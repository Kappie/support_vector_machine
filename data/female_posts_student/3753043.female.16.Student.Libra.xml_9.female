Anyways, indeed.  Erm... *long silence due to lack of brain fuction* ...*eyes roll back into head* ... *drool* Yeeesss... Well I finally got some decent 16 gauge earrings for my third lobe... erm "holes"? Should I call them holes or piercings or.. Well yea. Bah! You know what I mean. So cry me a river and I'll build you a cannoe so that you can travel down stream and find someone who cares! o_O Lol! Damn that was fucking random.. I think that's my little singnal that Brinny needs her sleep.. Meeheeee... But yes, now they match my 14's in my 2nd holes and my 12's in my 1st's. Well.. somehow they match.. in some.... way... >_> But I need new 14's for my 2nd's cuz the ones I have now are crap. CRAP!!!  Anyways, yes, earrings and then me and duddy went to see fahrenheit (Omg! Could that word be  any  more harder to spell!? Jesus christ..) 9/11 while mummy and Colie saw Anchorman (sp??). Thus, Bush is now an  Official  (note the capatilization.. omg!) asshole cuz now I fully comprehend the extent of his asshole abilities. See, before I just hated his fucked up eyebrows and non-existant lips. But now I really know  why  to hate the bastard. And for that, I thank Micheal Moore. *give Micheal Moore a puppy* ^_^ Mehee... tomorrow I'll probably read this and be all "What the deuce!?" Lmao! Deuce! Christ, that's like the best word  ever !
