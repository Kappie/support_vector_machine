A and H are coming at 5 and I somehow have to finish piano by 9:15, which I'm not too thrilled about, but these things have to get done.   It's sad that piano has become such a small priority, but it just demands so much energy that I wonder how it ever happened before. I am chronically pooped, and often I don't want to play. It's the strongest obligation in me...it's like compulsion to eat broccoli for your own good, raised exponentially to some arbitrarily large power.   Sleepy day. Mock trial in the morning, hw to do now. Food, perhaps.  I've come from being the most conservative girl to what? a flirt, a whore? or so J says. It's bizarre the way things have been going, but to say the least, I'm really backing off and in no way am I the jealous one. How in the world did Julia think she'd be hurting my feelings? Doesn't she realize that I always look like that?   Hm, some serious pondering on my plate.
