I had to print off all of the chapter questions for our the weekly quizzes in my  Physical Geography  class. I printed those off, and had to  print off the   powerpoint lectures . I try to conserve paper but there are alot of  maps and illustrations  that have to be printed off on a single page in order to read what is on them.   Mid-way through de-backgrounding the lecture #2's powerpoint, a dude comes by and said "Does this belong to you?" I thought he was just being nice and handing me my printouts. No! Boy was I wrong! He  proceeded to accost me for printing out powerpoints on single pages of paper. "You need to try to print out powerpoints on handouts with two or three handouts on them. Otherwise you will lose your printing privileges."    :0 !!! What is this?!  and on top of that,  he threw all of my chapter question printouts into the trash!    What a complete jerk!   ARRRRRGGGHHH!!! Really, I'm not in the mood to stay at Manitou to print off all the powerpoints that I can on single pages. I really do have a life!   Geez! em>
