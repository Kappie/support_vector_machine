It'll be pretty and fun!  And cubing!  Hurray!  Oh, I will not be bringing the spoon.  It is too dangerous to have in public.  Jason, Maggie, and Salcido are threats and therefore I shant be bringing it.  Sorry Val, i really wanted to show you it.  I now some of us hated the last question that Ryan asked because it was so random, but I gotta ask: If you had three wishes that would come true, what would they be!  I said: 1)  Pokemon really excisted (c'mon, that would be friggin awesome) 2)  That everyone of my friends and relatives lives to a ripe old age and does not die of disease, murder, etc. 3)  More wishes!  Or if that doesn't work, I want to become a super hero and save the world.  My power source being the Spoon of truth and power!
