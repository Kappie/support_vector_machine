I did not know that so many of the people that live on Norrath or not inclined to help me in my noble quest. Perhaps I am still a little young with the high hopes and ambitions of the young, yet it was a shock to meet those that did not wish to smite the evil to protect the young, helpless and innocent.   I met an Iksar the first night without Ziggur and my companions, we were going to go to Dulak harbor to clear the beach. I know that Iksars are supposed to be mean and ferocious beasts however I have met many, such as Delltree, that I trusted him with my life. I was wrong. As we were swimming to the beach I yelled out to him not to swim to fast because I can not swim too well. Yet he trudged on with out me. I yelled that I am frail and have met my demise many a time on this beach, yet he still left me. There were many undead there and they all did not like intruders. I did the best that I could yet I still met a valiant doom. When Brell kindly brought me back to the Plane of Knowledge I contacted the Iksar, he had fallen fast asleep under the waters of the beach. I was not impressed. I contacted my allyâ€™s and they retrieved my belongings for me. They were slightly concerned that I would not make it on my own however I told them that with Brells wisdom and faith I can accomplish anything.   And so I picked myself up and carried on.  -- Akcron --- Ziggur! Wait for Backup!!
