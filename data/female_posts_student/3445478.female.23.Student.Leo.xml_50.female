After that we three went to Barnes and Noble then Pam  Daryl's house for some map help for Shawn in the cities. From there we dragged our tired, hot exhausted selves to the lakewalk. It has been the most beautiful day of the year so far!  Shawn's gone back to the cities =( But Nick and I went up to Grandma Lu's and picked up Keely for the night! At Grandma Lu's, Nick got "five thousand" kisses and I got a slice of incredible apple walnut pie that Billy's brother, Mark, made. Nick feel asleep in my arms on the deck and when we all went into the house, I noticed he had blood on the back of his head!!!!! A HUGE DROP!!!!He must have got a mosquito bite. He never even cried...My Brave Boy! ;)  It has been such a great weekend with Shawn home! I can't wait until Friday night!!! Only 5 more nights and 4 1/2 more days!!!
