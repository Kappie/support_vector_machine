I rerecorded some of the old classics at Nick Bruey's house today. Golly gee, that kid. I wonder if he's human. I really do. But we did some recording and got the musical backbone to  Painpainted  down, now are the excessively violent lyrics! There's actually going to be radio-edit of sorts so that the parentals can hear this masterwork.  But enough aboot me, eh. My mother has a broken ankle so we're having to fend for ourselves, pretty much, and for her, now that I think of it. But it's all good. We always have enough junk in here to sustain ourselves on. As long as I don't get fat, hey, I dun care what I eat. Not to say that I'm not fat, but still.  God, am I an egotist, I started talking about me again! Brr! Katie is being Katie. She got an MP3 player and is no longer listening to the family, so it's impossible to talk to her anymore. My dad's phone line is out, and he hasn't been heard from for the last three days or so. Hmm.  T-Mobile still being gay. I'm really hungry, surviving on Wendy's ( was surviving , it kinda ran out) and Abby's wonderful Christ o' the Mas chocolate chip cookizzles. And I think I need to go do some Sarah Bayrd. Now that you are all bored out of your skulls, I wish you all an excellent day.  Just read Rosie's post, so as a P.S.: he was referring to the car.
