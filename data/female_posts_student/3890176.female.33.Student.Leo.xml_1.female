Tonights class is computer applications and it is a five hour class (yuck on the hours) but am excited to learn all the microsoft application programs.  I just wonder how long am I gonna have to wait to get my book. On the first night of each new semester, you have to wait til the book keeper comes to the class to say we can get our book. I hate doing it that way and wish the school would do it like they have mentioned to me, is that they are trying to let us old students get our books before the quarter is out, so all they have to do is give out the books for the new students, but that will never happen.  I wish I could get my two other books tonight, but know they won't let me. I will be using my A books again and my English Composition books again so that saves me bookshelf room LOL :) The only other two books I will be getting is Medical Law  Ethics and Therapuetic Communications. I am anxious to start all of the new classes and see how it goes. The only thing I am wondering is what Instructors am I getting and how are they.  Will post tomorrow of how my first night of class went and for each new class this week :)    Til next time!
