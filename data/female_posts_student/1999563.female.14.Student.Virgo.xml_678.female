This girl who was my age..we were walking around town and she was like "OH MY GOSH. I GOT DIRT ON MY SHOES! these cost 150 dolllars!" I almost puked. Not to mention she was flinging around her 500 dollar Louis Vuitton purse. Yuck.  Well, that described my week. Haha. I saw the ice cream man. Haha.  But yeah.  Then tonight i went to HYPE which was great fun. I ate a hamburger!  The end...
