The first Catholic woman says, "My son is a priest, when he walks in a room, everyone says 'Hello, Father'".   The second Catholic woman says, "My son is a Bishop. When he walks in a room, everyone says to him, 'Hello, Your Grace'".   The third Catholic woman says, "My son is a Cardinal. When he walks into a room, everyone greets him 'Your Eminence'".   Then all three turn to the fourth woman and give her a subtle "Well?" expression.   She finally sips her coffee then says, "My son is 6'4", terribly handsome, broad shoulders, dresses in the finest clothes.  When he enters a room, the women all say, 'Oh, my God' . . ."  Happy Mother's Day to all moms.    More to come...
