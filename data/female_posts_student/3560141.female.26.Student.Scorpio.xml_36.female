Our interaction began with the scripted formalities one extends to every Indian person one ever meets (I've decided that if one more person asks so what do you do...I'm going to tell them I work in underserved communities as a graffiti artist and have you seen my latest work on the Goethal's Bridge - it's what the baby on Biggie's Ready to Die grew up to look like, since he's really my kid)...I'm going to call her Sweat, it's not a far reach from her real name..my cousin, the one chick that stood as the standard, so I secretly grew to love hating her.  She never did a thing but be herself, stunning, intelligent, sarcastic, and just plain fun.  Without ever knowing it, I think parents instigate the imaginary feuds that come from constantly comparing two things.  Point being, my dad and Sweat tag teamed the wrestling match I had with my self esteem growing up as a kid and hell even now...  This time it was different when I reached out to her...I hugged her in her beautiful condo which faces both the river and the city of Chicago...stunning..some things do not change...She had the likes of a movie star who just threw on designer jeans and a tank with pieces of jewelry that in certain lights were sure to sear my retina...but the point being, we ate at a crab shack where noone knew how to crack the crab, so we moved on to crab cakes, the work's already done, we drank domestic beers, went to eighties bars where trucker hats, fooseball, and get this ping pong kept us entertained till dawn...we laughed so hard, the whole clan is just hilarious...then she talked to me (alcohol may be a reality blocker, but it has openned up so many roads of communication that I would never trade ever), she, the most independent sharp witty woman I know, is looking for a love, that doesnt feel like a burden, like obligation does not exist...her father has been diagnosed with Parkinson's and she describes the way her mother without even thinking has taken care of him, with a whole heart and not an ounce of resentment...how many people can do this she asked..I want to love someone like that, and be loved like that, tears began to well in the corners of both of our eyes...I said then with all the other things being exactly as you wished for, don't settle for just any functional form of love...live to meet the love of your life...we both cried...tears of the sad reality that this may never happen for either one of us, and my tears had hints of joy for finally letting go of resentment and jealousy...
