But I had saved it for just such an occasion because I think its one of the most random emails I have ever written. Ok, definitely not the most random, but its up there. One of these days I'll actually write something current and put it up. But til then...    Here is the article a friend sent me that was all about sex clubs. Read it and just TRY to tell me that it doesn’t sound like something you’d totally think about trying just once for fun (but also never actually do it cuz its one of those, gee sounds sexy, I'll think about it, but umm NO).   http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/11/fashion/11SWIN.html   And just because I was curious I looked up some caffeine stats. The MW of caffeine is 194 g/mol. There is on average 200 mg caffeine in a regular strength 8 oz cup o joe (100-120 mg in soda, 60 mg in tea). Thus, the average 8 oz cup o joe has about a 1 mM concentration of caffeine. Who knew?  And finally, someone asked me about migraines so I looked that up too. Migraine headaches are quintessentially caused by stress. Stress causes arteries that supply the brain to go into spasms, which leads to some platelet-clumping within those arteries and ultimately releases serotonin. Serotonin is a vasoconstrictor and causes other arteries to constrict, but this begins to limit blood supply to the brain. So what does the body do? Can’t shut the brain down… OoOOHHH noooo…the brain is very very important. So as a compensatory method, arteries begin to dilate all over the brain, from the initial source of the headache through the scalp and neck, and presumably supplies regions where pain receptors can be stimulated. And this, my friend, is what causes the pain of a migraine headache. ARE YOU EXPERIENCING STRESS?   http://www.mckinley.uiuc.edu/health-info/dis-cond/headache/migr-hea.html  Tata!
