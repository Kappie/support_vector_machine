What's it about?  Imagine if they rewrote sesame street for adults   AVENUE Q is the story of Princeton, a bright-eyed   (and well hung)  college grad who comes to New York City  with big dreams and a tiny bank account. He soon discovers  that the only neighborhood in his price range is Avenue Q;  still, the neighbors seem nice.    With endearing songs like " Everyone's a little bit Racist ","  You Can Be as Loud as the Hell  You Want (When You're Makin' Love)"  and "   I'm not Wearing anyUnderwear Today " it's tons of fun for the whole (anyone above 16) family.  I don't want to ruin the show for anyone who might see it, but I was in stitches the whole time :) It's well worth the money.
