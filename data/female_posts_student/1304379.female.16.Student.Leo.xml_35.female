She had become a drug addict after being brutally struck by the Economic Crisis in 1997, and has yet to pick up the remnants of a failed business venture. Hui Cheng thought that she had fallen into unfathomable abysses of disgrace. She had lost to the fight against adversity.         After being caught in a raid at one of the discotheques in Mohammad Sultan Rd for possessing ketamine, she was juried to stay in The Singapore Drug Rehabilitation Centre for a year.         As a volunteer in the rehabilitation centre, I talked to her and shook her up from befuddlement. She promised to change her ways for the sake of her bedridden stepmother who was at the last phase of her life. Shortly after making such a life changing decision, she was released from the drug rehabilitation centre.         Hui Cheng found a job at a chain coffee shop [Killiney's Kopitiam] that gave former drug addicts a new ray of hope. She was employed at a diminutive pay in comparison to her previous occupation. I could see her unwillingness from the eyes that betrayed her. However, she knew that there was not much of a choice, as it would not be easy finding a job out there as she had a record.         “Good Morning Sir, you exude such radiance that would make the sun jealous! So would you like a cup of coffee with our world-renowned kaya toast?” suggested Hui Cheng in a chirpy voice. At one glance, we could see Hui Cheng’s ability to ingratiate the customers without overdoing it. She was indeed cut out to be a Public Relations Officer.         From the table where I was seated, I could see that Hui Cheng had truly turned over a new leaf. She had triumphed. She had gone through cold turkey and came out a stronger person.         However, two weeks later, the boss started to complain about her restlessness and zombie-like expressions. “She’ll always bring a plastic bag containing god-forbid-us-to-know around! If this continues, I’ll have to sack her,” commented the boss.         “Where’s Hui Cheng?” I asked in great dismay.         “Back alley fagging a cig I suppose,” cried the boss, shaking his receding hairline head.         As I ran towards the back alley, I saw Hui Cheng. Her fingers interlocked, with a plastic bag clasped in the middle, her head bent low as she inhaled a deep, slow breath from the plastic bag. She was squatting down on the floor with puddles of wet mud all over the place. She did not look human to me. It was a degrading sight. It was beast-like. It was obvious that she had never intended to keep her promise. Her turning over a new leaf was simply a façade. A fallacy.        My footsteps felt heavy as I dragged my feet away from such a sight. I could feel the depressing pressure with every step I took. I went back into the coffee shop, sat down and sipped my cup of coffee. As the backflow of tears slid through my throat, I could not taste the coffee but the tears within.
