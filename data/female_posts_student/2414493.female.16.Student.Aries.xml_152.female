Then you go to your room, lay on the bed and breathe. But I'll laugh now. Another excursion today would have been unreasonable.  I just hope next year's spring break will be better. At least I'll drive by then, and then excursions galore. It's 1:34. I woke up at 10:45 and already I've run out of things to do.
