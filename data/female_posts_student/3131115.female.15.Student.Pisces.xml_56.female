I said that I'd smoke them all tomorrow and get it over with and just smoke them so they're gone...but now I know the truth. Tonight I couldn't help it. I smoked...infact, I smoked two..and I was about to smoke three when I started to shake uncontrollably, and I almost fell backwards. I sat on my bed...and I couldnt move. Other than the shaking..my body pretty much had no feeling. I've never heard of someone acting like this after smoking. I mean..I think it's just the position Im in when Im smoking..because I stand on my nightstand and do it out the window like a moron..but it gets worse each time. That has nothing to do with what Im going to say though...I thought I could stop. I told myself that I wasn't addicted. I am. I am so ashamed to admit it, but I just can't stop getting the cravings. I know that when I smoke the last two tomorrow..I wont be able to get more for a long time....which I'm really happy about..although that doesnt stop the itching for them. I dont know what the fuck to do..I feel like when I smoke the last two, Im going to start stealing from my parents, or stealing from other people or doing something. I dont know...it's horrible. Even now, after smoking two and all of that happening, I want more. I want more..but I dont want to smoke anymore. I dont want to want more. How the hell could I let this happen?!? I said that I could never get addicted to anything..and here I am, finally admitting to something that has probably been true for a year now....I truly do hate who I've become.
