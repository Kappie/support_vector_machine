It's about a genius who opens up some kind of portal to the fairy world and steals all their money so he can use it to find his father who was taken by the Russian mob.  When I finish those, I'm going to read Long Hot Summoning... Ok I just saw everyone with their minds in the gutter perk up. The only thing long and hot in the book is the summer weather, which, if you are in the book and are standing in the parallel universe featured there, is so hot the tar is melting.   Found yet another kick ass blog((as nikki would say)), check stinkstankstunk.   Mom was drinking, which really gets on my nerves because I was trying to practice and she kept screaming broken Eagles' lyrics at the top of her lungs. But she's asleep now, and I'm glad.  I was thinking about how people are often telling me they are boring and everyday. I made me realize that if you think about it, everyone is different in some way, and that even if you have to go into molecular detail, nothing is the same. Making words like average, everyday, and normal, positively void. That was your dose of caitlin-sprinkled philosophy for the month.   You know, I used to write infinitely long posts of everything, even dumb stuff that I knew nobody would care to read, but I've noticed my blogging has become more scarce and I don't like it one bit. I guess it's because when I read someone else's blog, if they have a particularly long paragraph, I will skim over it or skip it completely. But as long as I maintain blogging at least once a day, I'm happy. Because I cannot stand it when people don't post for days at a time and I visit their site as part of my normal routine and am greeted by the same freaking thing. Over and over and over.  Ok it's almost 10, I think I'm done now.  You know what? I'm going to write a song tonight and post it on here in the morning. It will be a good song.
