I layed there and wondered what you might be doing at that very moment, 5:02AM. West Coast Time. An opifany. A moment when time stopped but never began.   Last night I would have walked the plank to be in your arms. Cut out my own heart to hear your voice.   I called for you last night and you didn't answer. I don't even know if anyone answered - I just know that whoever, whatever - it wasn't you.    I was prepared to tell you everything about me last night. Tell you everything about our future and our past. Tell you that I couldn't stand one moment in my future without you.   Today I fumble my words because I still want to curl up into a tiny ball and cry until I see you. I am sorry for being the loser jerk ass girlfriend who doesn't realize what she has. Futhermore, I am sorry that no one I know can understand the passion and love I feel for you. And the passion and love that you give to me....how sweet our moments are. Baby, for you there is no one comparable and I can't wait to rush to you - run to you -   Lost in the middle but found on the way home.   I don't know how to leave you again.   I love you.
