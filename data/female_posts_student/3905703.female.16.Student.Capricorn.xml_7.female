This time I am referring to her decision about the dress code for the appointees for Investiture Ceremony (march past).It is: a white kurta ( no embroidery and should be full sleeves with a collar), along with a Gandhi cap( God knows when Gandhiji wore a cap). She is also going to make us wear Tiranga sashes (hope I have got the spelling correct) .I do think it is a non sensible idea, I mean our uniforms are so much more smarter. But anyhow who can stop her .She is The Invincible.    Anyhow Karan has been very kind to my writing that I am a tomboyish person and hitting me right throughout the day . Says he can do that if I am really that sort of person. Anyhow I will be changing that in a few days time.Could not do it today , have just returned from another tiring session of Fiitjee.    After going through what I have written I do think I use too many Anyhows . Lagta hai I have to search for a new tagline.    Till then  Cherio.
