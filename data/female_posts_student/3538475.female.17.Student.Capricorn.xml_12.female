I thought I'd be clever and sit outside and revise to get some colour on myself..I got colour, just not the nice brown I hoped for...I could sit on the shelves in the shop and be sold as a beetroot, well my back could neway.  I think my legs are destined for milk bottle-dom forever.  I would have gone into town for an hour or so....but I couldn't meet people as I don't have credit and my only way of getting in had gone already.  So tonight I plan to revise in between watching bits of tv, having fags and eating and drinking.
