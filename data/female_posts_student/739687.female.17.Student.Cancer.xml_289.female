But...(and there is always that little exception, isn't there? that little catch to optimism that drags it under a bit)...I'm so skeptical of good things.  I hate it.  I just get so sure that something is going to come knock me off my little pedestal. But ya know what? I'm the only person that can do that. So I have to stop. This is  my  life and no other force controls it but myself. I am in control of my goddamn destiny. So there. Plain and simple.  So back to optimism. Yes...things are going pretty good lately. Ahh, but I don't want this vacation. It's like horrible timing. Always always. Why must my family ruin my life?? I've decided that if God exists...he really really REALLY hates me. He just hates me so much, that he likes to fuck with my mind a little and then kick me down. Ughh. If he doesn't exist, then I'm just a horribly horribly unlucky person.  Note to self: You control your life, dammit. So get control of it!  Well, that's about it. I am thinking a shower sounds good right about now.  Oh...and also: "Uh oh!"                       "You can't fool me. I don't want a room full of pillows."                       *Staple spoon.*  Hahahaha....God help me.  Control your own destiny, crazies.
