So it was bastante creepy when this man stops in the middle of Main Street and goes, "Where's the police department?". We must of made a funny face. He goes, "I'm serious where's the police station!" Then we proceeded to tell him to turn right before the doctor's office, when really Stefany should have said turn left. It was pretty lame.
