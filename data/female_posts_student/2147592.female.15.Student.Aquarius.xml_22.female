Last night I cried myself to sleep lastnight because Sammy said he liked Tabby, then Letty (it was a joke, I think) but it just made me think about everything, and all the people I've liked always likes my mates and it does my head in, suppose I'm just not good enough! I'll get over it sooner or later, i always manage to eventually! Well Ive made a new cd and its all the depressing songs that I love, I've probably written about it already, but you'll get over it!  Well I'm gonna go love y'all xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxoh yeh, thanks Tabbyabbyabbyabbatha, Clur and SaMmY, you make people in this world happy, and I appreciate it! See you guys thursday xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
