I saw her and thought I won't go over and speak to her, but then thought don't be SO stupid Karen and so I went over. Asked her how she was and stuff.  She then had the audacity to say - "oh I haven't seen you in ages - where have you been?"!!!!!  She then asked how I was - and you'll be pleased to know that I didn't say fine. I said actually I have had a few crap weeks but hey I'm surviving.  She said we ought to meet up sometime.  I said well you need to decide when you are free and then sure just let me know.  So she said what about next week - and again I repeated - yeah you let me know when you are free and I'd love to see you.  So we'll have to wait and see what happens. She then said I have to go, packed up and left.  Um...just coincidence right?  But I'm not going to let it dampen my spirits - cos I'm coming to Canada!!
