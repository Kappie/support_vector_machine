He felt no jealousy or possessive nature towards the boy, and why would he? The college student wasn't in love nor did he have any particular strong feelings that would warrant him to be selfish like that. It was true that he liked Damien. He found the boy cute and refreshing to be around. When he had applied for a part time work at Sweet Delight, he could have never known that the little brunette would become his next "project".  And that's exactly what Damien was to Joel; a "project."  As a teenager, Joel discovered how thoroughly he was interested in playing around with people and the control that came along with it. There was something so delightfully splendid about the masquerade that was required in order to convince people of this and that. He would string them along with glorious lies and adapt to press what his current "project"  Occasionally Joel would wonder if, somewhere along the way, he'd eventually loose sight of who he really was since. What a funny notion...  He thought for a moment about the question. His mind could think of several plans of actions he could take.  "Well," Joel begun, "We can order pizza tonight since I'm lazy and don't want to cook."  "As for you, I think you should go take a bath or shower. I'm guessing you didn't wash your hair at the pool?"  Damien nodded.  "You need to get the chlorine out of it," he explained and checked his watch again. "It's closing time, so how you wait for me and then we go up shortly?"  Joel smiled, figuring that Damien would more than likely agree. The boy could be quite accommodating an, in certain ways, Damien looked like he had an innocent crush on the older male. That's what Joel thought anyway.
