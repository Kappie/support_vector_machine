From the interview with Jon on April, 1, we have outlined four areas of potential contribution of this study to business community  1. increase leverage of partner's time (more efficient ways to help teams understand the business context and the clients)  2. develop team   3. Improve quality of projects and client satisfaction (create models for best practices from an executive development perspective, optimal models for partner teams to operate, compare the "ideal model" with development models and competency models used in the firm)  4. Help internal staff make their role transition.  How can I translate these benefits to the firms to benefits for the individuals I'm trying to interview? What are the things that these professors care about? What are the things that Jon's friend at Hewitt might find compelling? From the last draft of my proposal, I listed the following benefits: - improve perceived service quality (better understanding of the client's perception of "quality")  - increase new business opportunities (help others understand where the partner is coming from, talk their talk) - leadership skill (improve team attitude through modeling/coaching, coach clients, design of teams, strategies) - facilitate relationship development (a feeling that the partner really cares and really understands) - facilitate human asset development for their firm -- contribution to their organization - increase efficiency with their teams
