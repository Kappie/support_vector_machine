I thought that she seriously hated me since she hasn't replied to any of the manye-mails that I've sent to her over the summer but it turns out that she hasn't had access to a computer to read and reply to them. How did I find all of this out, you may ask me... Well, you see, she sent me a two page letter about her summer vacation and why she hadn't wrote to me for SO long. She's been really busy over the summer. She has swim practice every morning and softball practice every evening. She's also been away to all sorts of different girl scout camps.   I'm so glad that she doesn't hate me. Katelyn and I got into a big fight at school. It was our first fight and we didn't talk to one another for an entire week after it... Eventually we became friends again with the help of some of our other friends. Once I got the letter from her today, I began writing back almost immediately. I filled her in on everything going on in my end of the pool, while writing down advice and a few other encouraging words to her. My letter is almost a page longer. I hope it's all right. I haven't seen or heard from her in an entire month. I really miss her. We used to talk about everything together. Hopefully my letter doesn't sound too sappy or whatever. Well, it's not exactly sappy. It's more happy and excited that I've heard from her, type of letter. I bet I sound like a blabbering idiot. Yet, oh well, if she's a true friend then she seriously won't care.  When reading her letter to me, I found out all sorts of interesting things. My other friend, Chloe, dyed her hair pink and blue. She's also having a very hot foreign exchange student stay at her house. I can't believe her mother let her do either. Chloe's mom is a VERY controlling woman. She hardly ever lets Chloe or her brother do what they want. I wonder if her mom even knew that Chloe was going to dye her hair. If not, I would have loved to see the expression on her face when she found out. Though it sounds a bit rude or whatever, I think I'd burst out laughing if I saw that...  Anyways, I've got to get going... I'm so happy that Katelyn doesn't hate me. BeforeI wasn't sure if she even liked me. This letter tells me otherwise, doesn't it? Or maybe Katelyn wrote it out of pity or whatever... Ah, let me forget about that thought... Write to you later...  And I'm gone...
