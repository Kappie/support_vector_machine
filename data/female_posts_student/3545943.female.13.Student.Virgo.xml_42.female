But anyway, it's pretty traditional, Renaissance-era-esque, long journeys, magic, and battling evil.  But that's such a broad outline that you could describe a horribly predictable or amazingly brilliant story that way.  I think my ideas are halfway decent, it's just the question of whether or not it gets screwed up on the way to the paper.
