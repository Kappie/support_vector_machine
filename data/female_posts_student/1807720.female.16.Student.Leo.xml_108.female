I got to school around 8:30 and well then around 9:30 did some Chem review for finals and then went to the quiet room in the public library to study more Chem!  Then Chels and I went to wendys and got taco salads then went to Chem in the afternoon.  That was my day!  Chem!  And well the Chem teacher was listening to music and like either I was imagining it, or she was like actually humming to the music.  I had to hold back my laughter cause it was hilarious.  I am like so into chem now and find it really interesting, and I don't want to admit it but I find studying chem fun!  And then chem teacher was like so incredibly nice.  She even told me that I had an awesome work ethic.  That actually made me feel soooooo good.  I always feel like no one realizes how hard I work at things and for things, and for someone to tell me that I have a really good work ethic, well that is an amazing feeling.  I feel alive for once, I feel like I am actually living.  I feel good, awesome, so many things.  I feel like I am on top of the world.  I feel like I can do anything I put my mind to.  I feel like things might just start to go my way a little, and I feel like everything will be ok.
