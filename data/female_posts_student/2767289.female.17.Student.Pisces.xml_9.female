Too bad I didn't get the tickets in time... I think they're probably sold out already... that's nothing new...  But I hope to still go down to the amphitheatre and get them the day of the concert... which is still some months away... I've got alot of things going on before then... The Bloody Lovelies are coming to Portland again!  And I'm fairly excited.  I hope I won't miss their concert this time.  Last time, I came right after they were done and packing their stuff... but I still got to hang around with the band and get their autographs.  Luckily Eric had his camera, so Serge took some pictures of me and the band and they sent them to me later on.  Nice group of guys.     I'm planning on inviting Irina to go with me.  For many reasons, really.  One, is she's never been to a concert...EVER! and I can sympathize.  Two, she's like the only one of my friends that actually would ENJOY the BL's music and not criticize any of it.  She's cool that way.  And, well... she always provides some sort of entertainment and you  can't   not  have a good time when she's around.  She's great.  I am also planning on surprising her with the Josh Groban Concert.  But...the thing is... I dont have the tickets yet... KEYWORD: YET!  Which means that I  WILL  get them!!! Promise to keep this updated.... Make it a good day!
