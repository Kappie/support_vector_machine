So here is my own version of the 90's: *A lot of old people died, or is that just me? 3 of my supposed 4 grandparents, people who adopted me as their grandchild, and generally old people I knew. OLD PEOPLE BEWARE OF THIS CHILD!!!  *The only place you could find Care Bears was Goodwill and flea markets. Now there is an overwhelming population of these little bears. Kinda creapy. *Okay off the subject, but I realized that trying is crap. There is no point. Slacking off is the way to go. No one really cares. Everything is predetermined. Take dance team. The first two years I wanted in so bad I almost peed my pants! okay not seriously but you get the picture. And I don't make it...all that time and effort. This year I didn't give a crap and I make it. What's wrong with this picture? I only showed up for like 2 rehersals this year. Karma is one TWISTED SISTER! (kinda cool band too...they were from the 80's werent' they?) *Okay speaking of peeing my pants, as you all should know, I have left my shoes at home twice now. I swear if I do it again, I will laugh so hard, I will pee. That is my promise to you! Sorry pants! *Michael Jackson was big in the early 90's wasn't he?  *Elementary school sucked. Bad memories for the most part. Well maybe not. 5th grade was the worst. I was a crazy little kid. ADD probably if I weren't so gosh darn cute! The school wanted my brother on drugs and to see a shrink because of his bit of hyperactivity. We are supposed to be drug free, but they want us on drugs...go figure! Didn't some kid in high school sell ridalin (SP?!) from when the school started him on it in elementary? It just leads to bad things. More to come later...
