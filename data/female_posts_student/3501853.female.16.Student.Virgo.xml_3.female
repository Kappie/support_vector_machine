I can't let go of you.And tonight, I close my eyes and dream that we're still one, I'd walk a thousand miles I'd swim across the sea What do I have to do, please just tell me" -matchbook romance  "California, here we come..right back where we started from, california"-phantom planet  Bye blogger, I'll write in a week from now =\
