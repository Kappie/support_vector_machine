I mean we have a true relationship now, and that has got to be one of the greatest things. I was reading someone else's blog yesterday and I found this:   "The romantics like to say that you know you're in love when the hardest thing to say is 'goodbye'. It's interesting to think that perhaps there is just one person out there completely meant for you and nothing, not hell or high water, will come between you and them and your fate to be in each others' arms for the rest of eternity."   And I know that in reality this usually doesn't occur. But after spending time with David and just being with him, I believe it. I really think that you shouldn't have an opinon unless you've been through it. How do you know there isnt just that one person out there for you. They could be right in front of you and you'd never know...I know I'm only 16 and that I'm probably too young to be in love or to say that I've found "The One", but you know what, it doesn't matter what age you are and others might put you down for being naive, but they don't know how this feels, the exhilaration I feel, the butterflies, the bond. As long as you find your love and they make you happy, then nothing else matters...  It barely has been 2 days and I miss his touch, his kiss, his lips, I love the way he made me feel while he was around...And for now, that's all gone. But I know deep in my heart, that we will be together again and soon and eventually, hopefully one day we can be together forever...I never want to have to leave the person that I love again....  "The romantics like to say that you know you're in love when the hardest thing to say is 'goodbye'."   I could stay awake just to hear you breathing Watch you smile while you are sleeping While you're far away and dreaming I could spend my life in this sweet surrender I could stay lost in this moment forever Every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure
