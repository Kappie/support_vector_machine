We cant even get our car in and out and had to park it at a neighbors house! LOL I talked to my cousion Justin yesterday,he got his drivers licence! YAY! Great for You! And I got a letter from Jeanette...so happy she wrote me back b/c no one ever does. Easter was good,went to Jd and Marys for dinner at about 1:00, then had to go to town and didnt get home till like 6:00...but it was all good. Lots of great food and everybody seemed to be in a pretty good mood. Someone was killed at Artic Man yet agian this year. What it basically is a big snowmaching party,lots of booze and drugs and aparently one guy was caught in an avalance and sufocated....something like this happends every year but it is still really sad to hear about. Nothing else much going on. Hope you all had a good Easter weekend!  Kayla
