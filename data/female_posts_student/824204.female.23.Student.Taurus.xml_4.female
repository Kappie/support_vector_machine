But what about if you lost someone you really love and it was THEIR fault?  Wouldn't that be even worse on you?   When that happens.. how do you move on?  How do you say ITS OVER.. when all your heart want and need is someone you can't be with?   You know they're wrong... EVERYONE KNOWS that he/she is wrong.... but you just can't accept it... You keep saying to yourself.. they didn't mean to.. they were just pressured or forced or they didn't have any other choice.  But the fact remains that as long as we are alive.. we have choices.. we can do either chose to do the right thing or chose the other path.    Yet you still cling to that reason of "being only human.. and being imperfect" to justify all the wrong that has happened.    Can anyone blame you for feeling the way you do?  My question still remains, how do you move on?  How can you tell yourself day in and day out that you can't possible love that person who has done such horrific things to you?    HOW????
