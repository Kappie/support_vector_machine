Now that things have...progressed, I wonder if I still think that. I was just picking blueberries in some wet weather outside and my mind was wandering. If virginity is a state of mind, let's say you are one of those saints, virgin, dedicating your life to God, get raped, in a martyr-ish way, and can you still live your virgin life? Seeing as you didn't lay down your virginity; it was taken. But if you did happen to lay down your virginity (stupidly)does that mean you can still be innocent; regain that innocence, later in life? Or even if you don't lose your virginity, that doesn't mean you aren't innocent. Or is virginity just a state of being? Is innocence lost forvever?   Speaking of which... urlLink August 1st is Lughnasadh , the old Celtic festival celebrating the first fruits of the harvest after the summer's work. Interesting to note, Lughnasadh was a time to make oaths, such as marriages, matchmaking and business deals.  Ironic. So very ironic. I wonder if there is a more binding oath than giving your body and your dreams and your purity to someone else. That someone didn't even realize it. The powerful mix of blood and seed and sweat. That magic moment lost in the damp dark rustling confines of a tent one Lughnasadh night. On Saturday night I couldn't sleep. I was remembering a year ago, wishing it never happened, wishing for things I can't have, glad to be alone. M didn't mention it of course. He doesn't even know what day it happend on. He doesn't know one of the three most important days of my life. This is too depressing.
