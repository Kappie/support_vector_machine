I'm  coming  home, but I've a favor to ask. I have a friend I'd like to bring home  with  me."Sure," they replied, "we'd love to meet him." "There's something you should know", the son continued, "He was hurt  pretty  bad in the war. He stepped on a land mine and lost an arm and a leg. He  has  no where to go, and I want him to come and live with us."  "I'm sorry to hear that, son. Maybe we can find somewhere for him." "No! Mom, Dad, I want him to live with us.""Son," said the father, "you  don't know what you're asking. Someone with such a handicap would be a  terrible burden on us. We have our own lives to live, and we can't let  something like this interfere with our lives. I think you should just  come  home and forget about this guy.He'll find a way to live on his own."  At that point, the son hung up the phone. The parents heard nothing  more  from him.  A few days later, they received a call from the San Francisco police.  Their  son had died after falling from a building, they were told. The police  believed it was suicide.  The grief-stricken parents flew to San Francisco and were taken to the  city  morgue to identify the body of their son. They recognized him, but to  their  horror they also discovered something they didn't know, their son had  only  one arm and one leg.  The parents in this story, like many of us, find it easy to love those  who  are good-looking or fun to have around, but we don't like people who  inconvenience us or make us feel uncomfortable. We would rather stay  away  from people who aren't as healthy, beautiful, or smart as we are.  Thankfully, there is someone won't treat us in that way.  Someone who loves us with an unconditional love. There's a miracle  called  Friendship.
