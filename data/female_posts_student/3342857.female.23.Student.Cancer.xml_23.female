Meeting Yuko again on July 26....is really something that i have been looking forward to......on Monday, July 26.......her parents took me to Osaka Castle then at night, i went out to somekind of cozy shop looking at Yuko practising her guitar......then on tues, she brought me to Kyoto....i actually fell in love with Kyoto.....i love the city for that it's a blend of modern and traditional and nature kind of feelings.....from modern Japanese buildings to old shrines and temples and also the flowing river. I swear i would go back to Kyoto at least 2 more times in my life...spring and autumn!!!! On that night...i had a very interesting conversation with her.....chat a lot about what we think of life..and i actually felt really comfortable telling her about Oscar.....i know she will understand exactly how i feel...and truly enough, after telling her about it, i was getting more ready to accept Oscar's death for some untold reason......after this chat i know a lot about her perspective of her life much more......... she and her mainstream theory.  Wed.....Yuko's birthday!!! Decorated her kitchen's glass door....should have done more...but no transport and didnt dare to make too much requests.....cooked her a successful pumpkin rice and curry chicken...they love it...so am i!!! Happy birthday......at nite, she brought me to a wonderful tofu restaurant that i love it so so so much......  Thurs....there we set off for our Disney adventure...taking bullet train again this time...but love to travel with someone i am close to...at least can chat about something that i love to and not to force out some conversation.....though it seems to come out from me simultaneously but i actually hope that i could keep quiet....and yet i cant stand quietness....sigh....that's me....  Disneyland..........i never expect myself to stay in such a nice hotel....going to Disneysea.....didnt really enjoy a lot like what i've expected initially but right after i found mermaid lagoon.....i am a changed person...i was so absorbed into it that my mind was telling me not to leave that place!!!!! I just love it.....spent quite some time in it, that by the time we left it's already dawn and the atmosphere started to become really really nice.....it has the ambience of a peaceful town with scenic view........i love the night view of disneysea....it's just amazing......and i actually wept a bit seeing the view from the aladdin palace across the lake to our hotel.....i cant believe i am actually able to enjoy such thing even though i am only 23yr old!!!! And i was actually happy that Yuko was there....my close friend after all.....and at the same time i was actually hoping that yein and su and leybie were there to share it......dunno why them......maybe because my life revolve in calgary with them!! Disneyland......as expected....swarmed with people...lively atmosphere......and such a cute Pooh attraction.......oh gosh........i love the shops there......and i love the hotel i was staying in.....so comfy!!!  Going back to osaka on saturday......sigh...end of my wonderful disney wonderland tour.....even though i was tanned...but nvm...it's all worth it!!!! On sunday....though yuko wanted to bring me to Kobe...but got cancelled,nvm...my mind didnt want to go anyway...prefer to see yuko is relaxing rather than planning hectically.....when i am on vacation....i hope ppl who is with me....will enjoy it as well......like what i told her...maybe when i was younger...i might want to travel more but now....i would rather opt for quality time spent....not sure it's because i am no longer a teenager but i want to appreciate something more than rushing to do it!!! Actually, I would prefer another day in Kyoto than in Kobe (hehehe  ^O^ ) but nvm....i will be back!! Anyway...had fun seeing around Osaka!!! Goodness...the ppl...it's so crowded everywhere!!!Oh wait.....okomiyaki for dinner!!!......i love it!!!!! some nice little pancake!  Monday.....blue.....sigh..leaving Japan soon......today...went to do some souvenirs shopping.....guilty that it's yuko's parents footing the bill again......they are just too nice!!!!! Monday BLUE is really hitting me hard...i was actually quite down ......but was waiting for yuko to come home...cooked and ate takoyaki....this was so good!!!!......wore yukata and played fireworks!!!...what a wonderful night.... weird (wearing kimono to a playground playing fireworks after such a long time!!!) but fun.  Yuko....i am going to miss my vacation......reaching airport....i was still feeling ok.....i know i am recharged,ready to go back to continue my unfinish business.......but my heart was so heavy when it was at the point where I had to hug and leave them......my eyes went teary but i held it....i know i had a wonderful time and i actually want to turn back and stay......but i was ok after that.......maybe because i really had a a fulfilling holiday...no complain at all.....a holiday that all my friend and perharps millions of ppl will be jealous of!!!!  This time i didnt miss Yuko that much compared to her first visit in Malaysia......the only reason i could think of was.......i spent enough time knowing her this time compare to our first meeting (only got to meet for less than 2 days.)...........now my respect and admiration for her has grown stronger.......  Hope to see her again in canada!!!
