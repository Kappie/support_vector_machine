(Its the math thing that works for Sod.) So here I am calculating what song was playing when Sophia was born, and low and behold, it was  Dont Drink The Water .  Now, if you don't know, and how would you, only a few people know on AOL, DDTW is her favorite song.  So much so, the morning after I went to see dmb, when I woke and came downstairs, she didn't say  'good morning mom'  or  'i missed you mom' , but she said,  'did you have fun, did they play ddtw?'   Yes, I think DDTW is her fave. song.  So its just too much for me to know that song was playing when she came into this world.
