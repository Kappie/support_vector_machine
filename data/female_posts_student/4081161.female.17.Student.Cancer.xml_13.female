I hurt: when I'm hungry.   I love: music.   I hate: most hip hop music. I'm sorry, I do.   I fear: being completely alone.   I hope: and I hop. A lot.   I crave: food.   I regret: ugly people. Wait, I don't get that.   I cry: and then I kill you if you see me.   I care: about bears.   I always: MISS GOOD CONAN EPS!   I long: for stuff.   I feel alone: Like a stone. I wait for you here. Like a stone.   I listen: to commericals.   I hide: because you're UGLY   I drive: . . . ha ha. NOT.   I sing: bad.   I dance: because I get bored.   I write: words.    I breathe: air. So profound.   I play: Trogdor.   I miss: Renee. And being around certain people.   I search: for my other sock.   I learn: my alphabet.    I feel: itchy.   I know: my alphabet.   I say: weird things.   I succeed: in saying weird things.   I fail: that stupid MOUS certification test.    I dream: weird stuff.   I wonder: when I'm going to sleep during the day.   I want: a guitar.   I worry: about getting boots.   I wish: for a guitar.   I have: a cd player.   I give: but I don't get stuff back.    [Bleeped]    I wait: and then I walk home.   I need: sleep.      -----      I need to go mow the lawn now.    = Cristie
