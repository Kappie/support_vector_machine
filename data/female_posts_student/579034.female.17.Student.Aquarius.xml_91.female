It was like straight dancin and eatin and drinkin (soda and shirley temples lol). One of the DJs (did you ever notice after a sweet 16 there is always a DJ story? lol) was all up on Melissa, Debra, and Me a little bit. It was mad funny, he said I had the best milkshake (I was dancin to it and he said this one thing I did was the best or something). I had a great time, and I wore the hat Deb got me for Christmas. The DJ was callin me J. Lo and tellin me he wanted my hat. I was like, um I'm not J. Lo and you can't have my hat... biotch!!! Well, I didn't say biotch, it just kinda fit in w/ the sentence lol. So... yea... thats about all thats goin on... tomrrow I dunno what imma do. Probably start my Chem review sheet or something. How sad and pathetic am I? Well, night x0x
