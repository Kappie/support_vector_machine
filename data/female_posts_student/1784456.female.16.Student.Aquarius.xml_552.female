Hehe, ohhhh, it's not that funny...* I would put a stop to third world debt and say "raboo suckers" to every one who complained! Eugh, people at school want me to give them the addy for this, is it ok for people to reading your sort of journal thingy? I guess if they do then they'll be even more wierded out than usual! Muhahahaha! Fun! Hehe, Lifehouse song says "Finding my way back to sanity, although I don't know what I'm gonna do when I get their." How cool! It's called Breathing so go out and download it or some thing! Mmm... back to the thoughts thing, I mean, it's seriously gotta be bad for you're health to read my mindless blog rambles each day, or ever! must decrease brain cell multiplication! (Just nod) Geez, if that's what it does to you what does it do to me?!
