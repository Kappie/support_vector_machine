MY SUMMER'S GONNA SUCK heres some cure just for you:   round and round and round and round and round we go  trying so hard to get a hold of everyone here  we've got to show how much we love them all  we squeak with idiot fake surprise  flap our hands and flutter our eyes  and lap up all their stupid lies  we've got to love them all   and I really don't know why we do it like this  imitation smiles and how 'it's wonderful to be her  i'm really not sure what we're so scared we'll mis   so round and round and round and round and round we go  hanging on every shape they throw  it's strange the way we can't say no  until we love them all...   so we laugh at every stupid joke  and smoke and choke and point and poke  and gag on countless lines...  how much we love them all!   and I really don't know why we do it like this  imitation smiles and how 'it's wonderful to be her  i'm really not sure what we're so scared we'll mis   maybe it's the sex with the drugs and the fools  or maybe it's the promise of belief?  maybe it's the pleasure and the pain of the cruel  or maybe it's the promise of relief?  and I know that we've said it so many times  'once more and never again'  but however many times that we've said it before  once more is never the end...  later days!           MEH
