I've been having one of those "leave-me-alone-I'm-writing" moods, lately. Yesterday I went and sat outside and just scribbled down some stuff..and today I went out for about an hour, and just got back in. I don't even know what I wrote down. I bet it was interesting, though. mhm.  Lets see...  I've been playin' some tennis lately, yup yup. Yesterday we had "team" practice and I was shocked when the *seniors* came out and graced the courts with their presence. Of course, they talked the entire time, then left without picking up any balls. But I had a nice time mingling with the freshman and turning them against the older players. Yay for me!  I was really-super-extra-nice, too. I went and got a basket of tennis balls out for them, since I'm only of the special people that knows the combination to the tennis hut..thing..whoo. At first, there was just a senior there and two freshman hitting against each other so I had to hit with the senior...which...I was just kind of thinking "Ohhh..*unappropriate blog word here*" But then all the seniors arrived and some other freshmen, so I saw the opportunity to leave the seniors by themselves and..it was justa good thing. Because then I actually got to practice! Yay! We played Canadian doubles, me versus the number 1 of the middle-school team last year and another girl..and they made me run. It was a very good work out for me, and I had to practice aiming the ball, alternating 'n whatnot so I didn't hit to one person the whole time.   I think the girl who was #1 on the middle school team last year will be in the top 6..I want to see her in the top 6, at least. She's good. She won't take over, but she's still good. I'm hoping I'll be #1..but..I just need to practice more. I played horribly at "open courts" today with George (my coach) and..yeah, that was depressing. But it made me wake up and realize that if I don't get my ducks in a row, I'm gonna get beat during challenges, and that would totally suck. So! More practice time for Megan, now. Lately I've been going out and serving from 7-8 anyway. I'll just have to do that more,  along  with practices with the "team" (pft) and George.   Moving on..  I went and shadowed at the newspaper place yesterday. It was..kind of interesting, kind of boring. It would have been absolutely horrible if I hadn't shadowed the guy that I ended up shadowing. He knew what it was like to just watch a person do ads and that kind of stuff, so he tried to make it as interactive as possible, I think. I ended up doing one of those "Happy Birthday" announcements and..I won't be able to forget it. It was to someone named Gatlin..and..the person had listed the entire family in the announcement, which was bizarre..and come to find out, this Gatlin girl has a grandparent named Snook..and..I just lost it there. I couldn't stop laughing for a while..I mean, Snook. SNOOK!  Anyway. I don't think I want to design ads for the rest of my life. It looks pretty boring. No way to really be creative, at least. But I'll keep an open mind. I mean, maybe my thing could be the magazine ads..or commercials. oh i love commercials. enh..It just seems like doing newspaper ads isn't that..thrilling.   In an hour or so I'm going back to shadow the same guy doing page layouts. I really don't know if I'm going to like that either, but..like I said..gotta keep an open mind. And this might be a nice opportunity to get a job next summer at the newspaper office. Who knows.  I really think the literary magazine is gonna be my main project next year, and I'm really excited about it. Honestly. I'm not just saying it like OMG I CANT WAIT 2 DO TEH LITARARY ZINE! I mean...I think it's gonna be fun. I'll get to do page layouts in creative ways...pick what stories, poetry, and artwork goes in and what doesn't (bwahahaha)...be an  editor ...yay!  To sum it all up..summer is getting boring. I'm ready to be back in school. Doing stuff.   Song: Let's Get It Started by the Black Eyed Peas
