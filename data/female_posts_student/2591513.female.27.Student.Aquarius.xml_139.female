So it has me thinking that I need to change a lot of things.  SOmethings I am already in the process of changing...some I have acknowledged I NEED to change and yet there are some things I am just now realizing I need to change...  NO MORE MEDDLING for me.  If someone comes to me, I will listen, but not try to fix their problems.  Problems can't be fixed by others, that is what I have learned.  (It is about gosh dang time too.)  NO MORE JUDGING, people are people, they are human and everyone has feelings and everyone has their faults and shortcomings...but it doesn't make other people better.  (This is one of those ongoing projects.)  I AM NOT PERFECT (now this is something I knew...but my actions spoke differently)...I am not better than anyone on this earth, I am me and that is all that counts.  Okay, so that was pretty darn honest.  I am making a great attempt to fix the "bad" things in my life and I feel good about the changes that are happening, you must change the ugliness inside in order to change the ugliness outside.
