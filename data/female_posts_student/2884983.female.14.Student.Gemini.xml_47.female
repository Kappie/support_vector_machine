I read my mangas!!! I havent done that in ages! I have about 25 or so on my favorites and I caught up on about 4 of them...not very many I know...but I think I am going to get rid of some of them because I never read them..and yet I am very hesitant about that because I love them all.he he he. I am not the only gaia obsessed people. half of my friends are too and they are also flipping out:) I am so glad that they are suffering as well *evil grin* lo lI am so mean :) la la la alala la la. I love that I can blog instead of Gaia. and that I can read instead, you knw that is basically what my life is...school, eating, sleeping, gaia, reading and music. those are all I do. I really dont have much of a life. but thats ok. when I do go out it is normally more enjoyable....normally.....anyways...my dog is insane. he likes to attack my hair...it hurts my  head when it is in a bun and he grabs it in his mouth and starts pulling. goddess let me tell you that it is veruy painful. *violent nodding* well anyways......... I am going to go read. good night all.  Fay.
