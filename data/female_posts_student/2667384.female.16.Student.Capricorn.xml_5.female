Exams are over and its time for me to move on. Uni here I come!! Well, first I have to wait on the exam results coming through and I can tell you I'm not expecting all A's. English was pretty annoying- Essays were not what I wanted them to be and the close reading was tough. I've become pretty annoyed at Helen because she keeps going on about how easy she found all of her exams. I can't wait to find out her results. Well, History was pretty damn hard. I studied like hell the night before and I can only hope for a good mark...Computing was on the same day as History, lucky for me. It did not go well. I'm sure the examiners will have a good laugh at my paper. Don't even to begin to think that I'm just being silly. Mr. Byars was outside the hall and pointed out all the mistakes I'd made. I just couldn't think. Oh well! Art was annoying. I wrote about the impressionists as well as the surrealists. I winged the last part but one factor that was not helping was the damn examiner talking to folk that were finished and leaving. I cracked at Lindsey-Anne and told her to "SHUT UP!" and then Nicole who really diserved it..I screamed at her and attempted to kill her with my table. Flibble. I apologised to poor Lindsey-Anne but made rude gestures towards Nicole. I tried, I really did. Now all I haved to do is wait until August.   Yesterday was great. I slept half the day. Played about on the computer and then I slept some more. Eat a little bit and went back to bed. Right now I'm heading into town to chill for a while and as Diane would put it "be a bum" at the Galleries. I hope to see some friendly faces (hint, hint).   Well, Later!
