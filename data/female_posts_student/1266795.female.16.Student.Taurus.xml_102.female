For those who I didn't talk to today, I received the results of the tests I've been doing for the past few months.  The original problem was that I had protein going where it wasn't supposed to go. However, my protein levels went from 700 (bad) to 1200 (worse), which is - listen to this! - the level they'd expect from a pregnant woman. (Jean-Luc, eh, Ash?)   So, for everyone who reads this, I'll have to have some surgery done this summer. (I already informed some people, but it was a "maybe" basis. No one knew that it was a sure thing until now.) They might even want to do it as soon as I get back, even though I'll have VBS,  my birthday , the North Star cookout, and (if it's serious and/or scheduled later) my $760 trip to St. Louis for Key Club International Convention. I'M TOO BUSY TO HAVE SURGERY! ARGH!  And I thought May was a bad month. I want Cali now.   *end quote goes here - don't feel like typing it*
