Drained by my pain within,    Sick of my down.  Tired of my wretched heart,  I Shout: - “Rip it off!  Take it far, far away…  I won’t need it anymore,  He’s dead already”    There’s no Hate,   Not even Sadness.  He’s just a dead spirit,  Waiting for the end to come.    Like a hard stone,  When it falls down,  It will break in a thousand pieces.  With no significance,  With no purpose,  Random pieces of a dead feeling.      ]-[ellMistress * Angel Who Can’t Fly
