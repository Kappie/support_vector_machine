I rush her to Children's hospital in a quickness. We was in the emergency room for two long hours. Now I've got to say that I am not a very patient person. Its a very sad picture to see a single mom that has no clue of whats gonna happen to her lil girl. As we waited and waited and waited, Alyssia's father showed up. He was the last person whom I wish to see. Damn, I truly hate his guts. Now i'm wondering who the hell called his ass? Has to be my mother. Damn, she's got a big mouth. He just came towards me and yelled the crap out of me at my face. All I wanted to do was to go off on him. But for the sake of my daughter I didnt. I tried to be nice and very polite as possible. It was so hard but I kept all the anger inside. After we saw the doctor, got the wound clean, got it stiched up. He said, "You shouldnt even have to bring her in, its only a lil cut". WTF! What a jerk! What a disgrace. He was such a manipulated person I have ever known in my life time. I was bomb, I was pisted. My reply was, " At least I brought her in, just to make sure she was okay and nothing would affect her later on in the future. If you've got things to do why the fuck are you here? I didnt call your ass and I dont need you to be here. After all these years, you never help me out with shit and you still have the balls to consider her as your daughter. Get the fuck out of my face I dont want to see you!". He was pisted. We didnt talked for the rest of the night. I never regret leaving him in the first place and I'm doing better off on my own. I know that Alyssia needs a father in the life but not the one who doesnt seize her value. People always say never look back into your past becuase it will only hurt you more. So I never did! I've learned to let go from the moment I step out. Once you've learned to let go of something or someone, dont ever go back to it. Lets just say your spitting out your saliva on the ground and later on you've got thirsty and srapt up that nasty dirty saliva and swallow. YEAK....
