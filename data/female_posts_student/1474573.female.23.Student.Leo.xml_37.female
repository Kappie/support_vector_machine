Y'all can email me (dianewah@yahoo.com) My foot is STill fucked up but not fighting (http://www.extrememuaythai.com/) is driving me insane. It is turning me into a very violent  person. Yeah not fighting is  turning  me violent? How does that work? I have no place to release so all my stresses unleash themselves within. I'm gonna end up like Adam Sandler's character in "Anger Management" Anyway I've been looking up boxing quotes. Lailah Ali had a fight a couple weeks ago and a friend of mine is fighting this weekend...I'm envious. I'm thinking i'm going back to the gym and monday and just friggin let it out.....wait...I'm slamming on monday....shit.. I should memorize my pieces...by ya'll...Here's some quotes   “…I dislike violence, nevertheless, the first time ever I threw a punch, I was hooked.”    “if I have cared too little for the fight itself and too much for dissecting how boxing makes me feel, how it changes and challenges me (my omission from the original), I’m happy.”    MOST POWERFULLY -> “…it’s still okay for girls to grow up believing what they weigh and wear is more important than what they know and read, say, and do. Sports can cure that. I am fighting stereotypes.”     ANOTHER WINNER -> “…and the fitness industry propagates and then profits from our imagined inadequacies.”
