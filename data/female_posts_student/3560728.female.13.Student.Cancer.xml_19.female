It was wierd because usually when I write songs I think of the melody first, and the lyrics later, but I still don't actually have a melody to go along with this one.)   Kansas Here I am standing in Somewhere That Doesn't Matter I glance at the window and draw pictures on hazy glass only to see them fade into summer.  Here I am someone who doesn't matter It's a quarter past nine and I don't know what to do with myself shall I hang the stars in the sky or blot out the moon with my fists?  Shall I let myself be broken with words? Shall I drown in your eyes and live with regrets?  Rearrange the hotel curtains as stale cigarette smoke enters my ruin I read postcards from home and wonder how I ever got so far away I can't bear to be with you can't bear to be without you you're a drug, a guilty pleasure  a habit that I just can't break.  Shall I let myself be broken with words? Shall I drown in your eyes and live with regrets? Shall I hide in this city of stars where the light never reaches anyone's gaze?  I look in the shattered mirror and see pieces of me. was it my rage that pierced that glass? It's just that the seasons never change here, the people never feel here. it's called paradise but it's becoming my hell.  Shall I let myself be broken with words? Shall I drown in your eyes and live with regrets? Shall I kill the night for you?!  I could string together thousands of words but say nothing at all Now I utter the first truth to the hotel curtains "I need you."  Shall I let myself be broken with words? (BROKEN BY YOU) Shall I drown in your eyes and live with regrets?   Here I am someone who doesn't matter fading into you.
