Then, this afternoon, I trek over for my daily trip to  urlLink Drudge , and find  urlLink this story  about Howard Stern and the FCC regulations on indecency on the radio.  It is moments like these that make me glad I went to law school.  The things I am learning here have some importance and application in the real world, which is something I didn't get at NYU as a Cinema Studies major.
