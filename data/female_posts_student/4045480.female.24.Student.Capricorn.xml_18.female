I am now officially in the process of attempting to put everything back, and I'm finding it's not going to be easy. I really don't know how I fit everything in this room for so long, but I'm going to try my damnedest to get it all back in here. At least my DVD's and my computer are set up, although I liked sitting on my bed and talking to people on IM, I think this is better for my posture.  Last night I went out for a classmates birthday, funny thing was it was just him and I watching the Cubs game at an Irish Pub our class has frequented. I was a bit weirded out that I agreed to this at first, but quickly it became two pals chatting and watching the game, whew, thank goodness. I really don't need to be dating a 31yr. old fellow grad student, who was in the Army and has more than a few mental scars from it. Saturday is his party, I'm going to that. It'll be fun to hang with him and a few of his single pals, and some other classmates of mine. I wanted to put this in my blog yesterday, but my bro messed up the internet again, damn porn sites (just kidding, I hope).  I'm hoping to start my studying Saturday, that is if my room is done tomorrow night. It should be, but one never knows. I'm still worried, but I have a week to prep, I think I'll be ok, and of course I can continuously review as I go, but I want it all to be fresh in my mind. I'm excited, finished all of my orientation, and that was a really great way to get started. I don't feel so clueless, just a little. I've been neglecting my workout this week, shame on me, but I'm going crazy with this room thing, and I know I'm going to step aerobics for sure on Saturday so it'll be ok. I just wish I could've gone to yoga today, but I was on a roll with the room. Alright, time for some sleep, tomorrow comes awfully fast.
