She bought some clothes and we got hit on...yeah it was funny. When we got to my house we wanted to watch Eurotrip but it wasnt playing so we watched Sacry Movie 3! It was sooo funny.     Then I was on my sn and I put up a really mean away message directed toward Liz and so she threated to call the cops on me...agian. So when I talked to my mom she said have her call the cops. I took the away message down because I didnt want to lower myself to her level. So about 30 min. later her dad calls and is telling my mom that I am blowing things out of proportion and my mom said the same to him about Liz.     Iam so sick of this crap and Iam through with our friendship. I have other friends.     Well I love Ryan soo much!!!    Bye Bye!
