And once I'm dry, maybe I'll think of summing nice to eat, but no further ahead than that.  And when I've eaten, maybe I'll look forward to a kip in a comfortable bed.  But after that, I dunno, Lyra.  There's been terrible things we seen, en't there? And more coming, more'n likely.  So I think I'd rather not know what's in the future." - The Golden Compass  Phillip Pullman  Can't sleep.  Tried to, but can't stop thinking.  I was given a precious gift and wasted it.  We got an extra year, a really good one, but that is all probably coming to an end.  And do you know what I spent that year doing? Nothing.  There was a time when I would sit at the table on Sundays for hours until they left.  I would sleep over at their apartment at least once a month.  Yet this past year I have neglected all of that.  Sunday nights were spent doing homework and the weekends were too busy.  I can't even claim I didn't know.  A year ago we thought we had six months, but then Glevic the wonder drug appeared and it was all sunshine and smiles and spending time was no longer a priority. Damn it.
