I saw that picture of you all  gangsta  and whatnot and I was thinking,  "So this is the guy that's favorite movie is Cinderella?"  I'm dumb. Yea, that's me! Your one and only dumb Yet darling babygirl =] . Anyways...     Happy 3rd Month anniversary     Three  months and I'm still madly, crazy, deeply, head over heels in love with you like I always have been in the beginning. Thank you for always being there (in thoughts of course =P) and caring so much about me. You're the  best   thing  going right in my life and I thnk  God  everyday for allowing me to have is one most precious gift...  your   love . I never really knew what love was until you came along wanting to  "make new friends".  Ha. There is not one imperfection aboutyou that I could think of  I'm always wondering what did Ido todeserve someone like you. Yea, we had some hard times like the rents, not talking, and the distance, but   hey  ... together we somehowput up with that shit and got through those obstacles. Again, thank you for always being the sweet, loving  boyfriend  that you are yo me. I'll never forget you, nor can I imagine myself forgetting you.    I love you Richieand I never will stop loving you.
