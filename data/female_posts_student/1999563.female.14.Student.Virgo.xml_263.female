Its sooo wonderful!!!  Then we went to the lucky brand jean store and they were having a HUGE sale so I  got these sue-wheat jeans that were normally 100 bucks for only 40! I was quite quite pleased.  Then we went to this littl boutique and I got mittens! that are cuuutttteee!!  Well, I guess thats all!  You guys rock!  Laura
