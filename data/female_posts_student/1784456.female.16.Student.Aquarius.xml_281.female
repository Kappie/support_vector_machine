It's also one of those I-don't-know-what-to-talk-about-but-I'll-keep-going moments. Oh hey and umm did we have any hw? Apart from that massive piece of French where we have to write about French shops in a booklet. And the point is...? Any French teachers out there please come and kick ours out! She's rubbish! Even the dreaded prison lady Meunch is better than her. (And that's saying a lot!) How come on Msn you have loads of people and no one's online? :( I'm gonna go be happy some where else...some where like the Moon...stay with that thought! Toodles! Remember; Just because you can't see out of every one's eyes doesn't mean that they can't. Okay, so I've gone a bit wierd but so what? It's Monday and we haven't got school! Toodles (again) *sigh* I really should go...
