If someone broke into your account and changed your password, you can still usually reclaim control of your journal. You need access to an email account that you had previously validated for your LiveJournal account.   If your email address has also been broken into, you will have to solve that problem before dealing with getting your stolen LiveJournal account back. Security of users' own email accounts is beyond LiveJournal's responsibility and ability, and you may wish to talk to whoever is hosting your email account.   Your LiveJournal account's security is based upon your email account's security. If you believe that your email account is secure, but are not positive, you should always change your email account password before changing your LiveJournal password.
