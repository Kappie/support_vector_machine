Of course nothing is really for free, and you'll have to agree to put five friends on their spam list and sign up for one of the "great offers" (AOL Broadband, Columbia House DVD club, Petcare RX, Citibank credit cards for  students, etc...).   Please please please don't give freeipods.com the real email addresses of your friends unless you were getting sick of them anyway. My suggestion is that you set up a group using disposable email addresses ( urlLink Spamex ,  urlLink Spam Gourmet ) and then you can delete the temporary addresses when everyone has their iPod. Oh and don't forget to cancel that subscription to the Columbia House DVD club. Do you really want them to send you  urlLink Daddy Day Care , which appears to be their monthly selection every month?
