Most of the time when I ask people who have just cut their hair  why  they did it, and I probe a little further than "I was just ready for a change", I find a really intimate story. It is often about a breakups; people, girls especially, seem to cut their hair after breakups. There is also something about starting a new chapter in life- which I guess is basically what happens during a breakup- but like for a new career, a move, etc. Transition seems to inspire haircuts, especially for women, although I haven't spoken w/many men on the topic. People also seem to cut their hair when they are seeking to bring transition on,  as if the act of cutting hair alone will create the change one longs for .   I think this is an interesting thread, and I'd like to do some research. What are some myths involving haircutting? Where does this desire come from? I seem to remember hearing something, maybe in some anthropology class, about women growing their hair out when they become mothers. I'm not sure if there are any cultures where women  cut  their hair to signify anything- ie, according to what I've seen, women seem to get dramatic haircuts to signify they're single again- or out of a relationship- or unattached- or just transformed somehow- or something. I know monks and nuns in the Buddhist tradition cut their hair when they take on robes. Maybe there's some evolutionary reason. Or maybe it's truly as simple as just wanting a 'change'. But that statement itself has some pretty vast implications- like, are you looking for Change in the big sense, like you're tired of life, or are you seriously just wanting to change your haircut.
