       
      Back in Toronto.  It's cold but the streets are better than before.  I did fall down on the way home from getting my groceries.  I guess I forgot momentarily to walk like a penguin on the icy side street and blammo, I was on the ground.  At least I didn't hurt anything except my ego, and maybe one of my bananas...  More to come...
