At this Annual Event, we swim, and see people you're related to, that you dont know exist!  Well,the day started off by swimming, and then we moved inside when it started raining (damn rain), coincidentally, the relatives from san diego, minnesota, and illinois, came at the same time! FUN! (sense the sarcasm everyone?!)  About 50 people just chillin in a house made for 13! whatever!  yeah, you get my drift, i could feel the the person next to me breathing- it was that packed!  wow, then with the need to escape the thick walls of the '67 threshold, nicole called to save the day!  "Come over to Joe's House...we're playing poker." "I'm All In."  So i bolt out that door and hop in the car, and realize, where the hell does joe live!  haha  After finding the house, we play some hard core poker.  Me, Lili, Nicole, Joe, and Pat.  Shortly joined by Dan, joe's brother.  I, of course, was done first.  But i definitley saved myself a couple times thanks to about 6 lucky straights I had!  hell yes!  As the night moved on, the afternoon sun drained me and forced me to retreat to my humble abode. Talked online for a while to Adam, and Joe...then to Brian Dziewa...that was weird! Oh well, gotta be nice to everyone i guess!  Got to Keep the Positive Attitude! LOL Hard Core!
