Friday I went to the football scimmage with Kol and Jess.  WE WON, can u believe it, okay, so technically you don't keep points in a scrimmage, but we won.. so..... we are counting it!  After the  scrimmage  Chad and Kaci met us at Applebees and then we hung out at  Ryans ... okay that is a little georgia, but whateva!  Chad and I made an important decision, and I am still in recovery... but he seems happy... and thats good.  Then Saturday I went out again with my buds... Leu's (where we were extreamly cheap) and then we splurged at the Melting Pot.  After that we all hung out.... in Chad's bed... lol, and watched  Earth Girls Are Easy ... well some of it.  And today I went to church, went to eat, slept, went to church, went to eat.... Im sooooo adventurous!!!   CHOW!
