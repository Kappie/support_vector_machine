And it was like 'it's really cheap...' yeah, I bet it is. Only $40 or something stupid! Hmm, well it is! $59 for one time, $14.95 a month! Hey, I got this free, I don't wanna go dishing out money! Any way, why not promote your site yourself? More fun and you can understand the internet more... Any one got $59? How much is that in £'s any way?
