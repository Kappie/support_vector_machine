Sitting at the drop-off window of Eckerd's yesterday, I discovered I was getting sick and that I should probably do something about it...of course, I was too late, and in just a few hours it came to life.  I thought it was mono round 2 at first...the hot-cold spells, the feeling of parasite heat in my brain, the hallucinations (and yesterday I had some good ones, my dad was FREAKED)...but I'm getting better pretty fast so I don't think it's mono. Altho the letters are coming on the screen a lot slower than I'm typing them...actually, the whole world is kinda moving in slow motion right now so that might mean a new wave.   Rosie, I noticed you called earlier. I've been sleeping most of the day, I was asleep then, but you'll be happy to know that the phone ringing was incorporated into one of the most [sic] and twisted dreams I've ever had. I don't remember what it was, I just remember jerking awake and scaring the cats when I yelled.   Speaking of remembering stuff...I don't really remember today at all. I don't remember yesterday. That must mean the acetominophen is wearing off, cuz I can feel that little buzz of fever coming back in. I'm going to cry. I hope I didn't pass this to Abby, whatever it is.  I tried cooking yesterday...that was when the first hallucination hit. And since then I've pretty much been a vegetable, eating oatmeal-raisin cookies (my second fav, next to peanut butter) and watching  BUFFY: THE FOURTH SEASON  on DVD. That show is really badass. Altho I finished it today so now I have nothing to do.  And of course...Abby is gone until after school starts, and that's making me a very weepy chimp...but I have pictures now!, so that's a bit of a bonus. But I'm still a weepy little chimp. Alex is gone until the fifth, so no sessions, but I am going to do some recording when I get better. Brooks, whom I've been playing CS with a lot lately, is about to leave for la Floride...and I yelled at him today for calling back two hours after I told him that I was really sick and needed to get some sleep. He called again and I hung up on him...I think he got the point now.   Sorry for talking so much, everyone. I'm desperate for company but I'm not very pleasant in the conversation department right now...so I'm probably going to isolate myself until I get better. So if I don't answer posts/the phone in the next few days, you'll know why.  Well, my dad's back with some more White Cranberry-Strawberry Cocktail stuff now (it's the best Brand-X juice in the universe...on sale at Kroger   NOW  !!!!) so I'm going to go down some and try to get some more sleep.  Until we meet again.
