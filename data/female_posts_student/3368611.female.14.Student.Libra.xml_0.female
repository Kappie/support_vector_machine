So we get like 10 problems for classwork that we have to do an answer key for. Unfortunately, we're doing  RADICALS , so there's a lot of confusion over the work, but we end up getting the problems and getting them RIGHT, as far as WE can see. We ask each other if we understand the math, to which we all say "yes". We spend our final minutes, confident in our knowledge of the work, playing  Tic-Tac-Toe  (I win 3 of the 16 games, Jaynina win 1, and the other 12 are ties). When we hand in our work,  Mr. Johnson  (our Math teacher) calls up Jaynina and two other kids to the board to do three of the problems. Two kids get it wrong, but put in good effort. Jaynina, however, can't even get to the first step of multiplying radicand by radicand and coefficient by coefficient. This leads Mr. Johnson to believe that we did NOT ask if we understood and did NOT work together and besides, we were playing Tic-Tac-Toe when we could've been reviewing. Of course, Davia and I protest that we DID ask if we all understood, to which Mr. Johnson says that we "should've given her a sample problem". Oh yeah. We REALLY think of that. Because of Jaynina, we lose  FIFTY  points off of an otherwise perfect classwork grade and spend the rest of the period sulking.     Example #2:   Last period today is Social Studies. NO ONE likes Social Studies, but we can make the best of that. For the FIRST TIME in S.S. history, we sit in  groups  that we can choose. I choose to sit with Davia because, as I mentioned earlier, she's cool peoples. Alejandro, our friend and resident Dominican who gets teased by getting called  MEXICAN  (don't ask me, I ain't start that, Garry did)decides that he wants to sit with us, too. We joke and say that we're the smart group because we all have high averages... at least higher than most people in our class. We call over Garry because he's smart too and become this "super" group as a joke. Now Akeem, this lil squirrelly kid is like "Oh HELL naw, they TOO SMART!!!" and people start yelling about that it's not fair that all of us are in one group. We ignore them and wait for work. It takes the class  TWENTY-FIVE  minutes to read a HALF-PAGE of text... the re-retards. In the course of this time,  Sequan ,  Loser of the Millenium Award Winner  for  FOURTEEN  years running, says the word "normalcy" as "nor-MAL-uh-Cee" (the numb nut), bringing back hilarious memories of his dyslexic behind mispronouncing the words "aisle" (he said "AYE-sul") and "pigeon" (he said "pid-GEE-on"). We laugh, he gets mad, so friggin WHAT. He ends up making fun of Alejandro for not being able to say " fundamentalism " right away, which is WAY better than not being able to say "aisle" at ALL. To top it all off, we have a S.S. test tomorrow and most people don't even know that it's happening or what it's on. Davia, Garry, Nime, Alejandro, and I do. WE listened.     Okay, now for the good parts of my day...   1) We had a  fire drill , which WOULD have been sucky-bus, but we had so much fun, that it can't be. First this girl went crazy, screaming and ish and that was friggin HILARIOUS, even if she WAS just playing... then we made fun of Garry cuz we saw this truck that said " Gary's Jamaican Hot Pot ", even though it was spelled different, it was still funny. Shaun got grabbed by the principal for pushing his cousin, William, when in all actuality, the fat-a$$ pushed him first.  Khalid  found a flyer advertising a restaurant that had his first AND last name... it was called the " Khalid Muhammad Restaurant " or something like that.   2)  Brandi  e-mailed me the next part of her story.... YaY!!!!  3) Amyra is finally  LEAVING ME ALONE  cuz I gave her two of the gosh-darn tattoos... ugh, all this fuss over some press-on B2K tattoos...  IT'S NOT THAT SERIOUS !!!!     Okay, until next time, folks...   -SmOokie
