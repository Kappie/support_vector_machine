Sorry, but I won't go into detail about these things, b/c, as much as I detest inside jokes...you know, when you aren't included...these are really good...and most of the few ppl who actually read this know the inside of the joke...     So here goes:  Things I Have Learned from Oklahoma:  -Don't touch Aly's pillowcase...  (It's been forbidden by the law.) -Blair has a fascination with tugging _ _ _  (The name is blank for her own protection.) -Jake Brakes  (For Ann...She made it funny) -It takes  2  calls to housekeeping to get few necessities..  (It was  just  6 sets of towels, a blanket, and 2 coffee packets. -Sometimes it gets too heavy, and then you just have to let it hang..  (If only she knew we were laughing at her ride...) -You never know what you'll run in to at the Rodeo...  (I swear we left to go get a drink. Back me up, Katy..) -MAD ANGRY ATTACK  COWS  OF DEATH..  (Ahh..Good times!! We'll never forget..) -The Tall White Dude  (He knew about the killer attack cows..He saved us..Our "Thanks!" to you) -"Who's Joseph?"  "Your boyfriend??"  (Kids say the darndest things...) -VULTURE!!!.....  (Just a little jingle we picked up along the way) -Pepto-Bismol...  (No clue how you spell it, but we can sing it's theme song!!!) -Susie's continous crying  (*Does impression* Consists of screaming, crying, and going balistic..) -Hunchback..of CPC  (*Does diff impression* Consists of being hunched over, and acting retarded.) -Battle Ship  (A real war..I have wounds...But "I Came, I Saw, I Conquered." -Late night talks with my girls  (Katy likes _ _ _...thinks that Aly obsesses over him...Blair doesn't seem    to dig any guys yet...Jen has actually had quite a few guys...and I'm an idiot    for going out with _ _ _ and should get over him(according to the masses)...  **For the privacy and protection of ceratin individuals, several names have been       blocked out.  Much love..  --Aub
