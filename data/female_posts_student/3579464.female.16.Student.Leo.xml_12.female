HE says "about" like "aboot" which for some reason is really cute, and he sounds like Bobby's Mom from Bobby's world (Don'tcha know now Bobby!) Anyway, pictures to follow, obviously, but he's a charmer and we hit it off like crazy.  Now the middle: (excerpted from an E-mail.)  Wait, maybe at this point i should explain about me and Ty. Okay, so, first of all, I have a boy at home who i'm totally in love with - we've been dating for over a year. (Ian, duh.) Also, Ty has a girlie at home, a recent girl, but a girl nonetheless. At any rate, we hit it off as friends at first, and then we realized that we could kind of fill in the affection that we were both missing from home, so we turned into like dummy-boy/girl-friends-at-home. ish. But then we kinda tested the boundaries of that and ended up liking each other a lot more than we were supposed to, i guess, so now we're just...awkwardly best friends? i guess? Soooo while we are not really having a long distance relationship, it still is one, just...yeah.   And the REAL story:   He slept in my bed every night. It sounds weird, but it really wasn't...we were that tight. Ian was kinda miffed, but i explained everythning. Oh, and the most physical we got was when he kissed me because he, "Couldn't help it!" No tongues, relax. The follow up...we talk almost every day, and he's a really awesome friend to have. He's debating at home whether or not to stay with his girl, because his feelings are kinda tossed up. My loyalties lie at home- SO proud I didn't do anything drastic! but He wants to come to NY in early August....hm. I guess we'll see where that goes, eh?
