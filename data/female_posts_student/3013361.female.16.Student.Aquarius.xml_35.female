On another note, I managed to get myself grounded for this weekend. I really don't think I deserve to be grounded. It was my brother's fault too and all he got as punishment was "don't provoke your sister" and I get "no going out all weekend, no having friends over, no movies, no nothing." My mother is so unfair and she favors him so much. I hate it!
