When I watered it tonight, with both a glass and a spray bottle, I told it to feel like it was just after a rain storm and it was living on a mist covered hill top.  I think its feeling a little better, maybe just because I talked to it.  There have been lots of experiments with plants that imply that they can become connected to their owner, that when the owner has some traumatic experience, the energy levels of the plant will spike.  I just finished a book, and am on two new ones.  These new ones are not for school, but aren't fantasy, so I think that I will be able to lay them down and not get addicted.  One called Eats, Shoots and Leaves.  It is a book about grammar, and people that are grammar freaks, and how they freak out and why punctuation is so important.  I have a friend I know who will like it when I'm done.  I thought it would be a good read before I started teaching.  My other book is on Raputin.  I love him.  As a historical figure, he is excellent.  I have been rather entranced with him since I did a report on him in high school.  How could you not love this huge, mystical, weird, powerful, peasant, Russian man?  He has a thousand stories just in his photos.  He seems to float out of this reality slightly- well, really far out now that he is "dead".  I say "dead" because there is always hope that he is yet still living.  At the very least he has likely been reincarnated and is shocking little girls and boys with his striking predictions right now somewhere.  Lovely.  I'm just taking a break.  Saturday night this week is an exercise in focus, in work.  I have finished one paper, I think, though I am sure there is much more editing to do on it.  Now I have two more to focus on, and with the struggle this last one was... How I will get through... But then again, it always gets done, one way or another.  I went to the thrift store today and got a present for my mom, and saw lots of things that I didn't buy.  I also went to the co-op and got some crystal ginger, and mango, and an herb that I had a dream about but didn't know what it did.  In the dream an old woman was making me up something to help with internal bleeding, and I had a vague sense of the name of the herb she was giving me.  Found it and looked it up.  It does help with stomach issues, which I haven't had in this body, but I don't know where stress could be building up.  When old witches out of the dream world give you instructions, I think that it is wise to take it.  I have been making sleep a priority the last few nights, and dreaming has been flooding back.  Good stuff, potent, syrup and butter of the mind.  My house makes noises when I am here all alone that make me a little... uncomfortable?  I ignore them, and they leave me alone.  That's the deal.  Still though, when I know that its going to be all night, it gets a little stressful.  Just me and the hum of my computer and the things that bump around in my room, in the kitchen, on the stairs, and in the living room.  Ok, I've ranted long enough, and I'm hungry... There must be something to eat around my house...
