She was never my kind of person but man, she was strong, now that I look back at it all. She was the first gay person I knew, and she was out in high school-- god, imagine being out in high school. Imagine the shit you would have to take. How strong you would have to be to be able to handle it.  We met up with her and her girlfriend, well, actually, her wife, but I'm having such a hard time taking that word in my mouth and making it sound like a serious word. I think I can't understand I'm old enough to have married friends. They have an 8-month-old baby, a boy, and they had him using an unknown donor. I wouldn't have thought that of them, well, not of H, anyway. From what I knew of her I would have thought she would have been one of those who praised the need of a male role model. I would have thought they would have had it with a known donor/a friend oreven a male couple. I think it's reallybrave of them to turn their back on the heteronormativeideas about 'a child needs a mother and a father' and 'a child needs a male role model'. To just say, well, this is our family and this is what it looks like. Seeing them with that kid made mesee that he'sgoing to be loved to bits.  Meeting up with them made me realize (for the thousandth time) that I want to have children, but that's about where the thought process stops, the rest of my life is pretty un-sorted. I want to have a child with an unknown donor as well for two reasons: less legal headaches since the donor couldn't change his mind and demand 'his' child 'back' or demand different conditions in relation to the childthan those inititally agreed on, and it would be my and my gf's child, no one else would be involved. Having a child with a male couple is not an option for me. Not at all. I understand why people do it -- it gives the child a mom and a dad and that's what they 'need' and it makes straight people accept it more readily. But it wouldn't be my gf's and my child, it would be some guy's and my child, with his and mine partner as supportive step parents, and that's not what I want. I want a family with my gf, not with some guy.  I guess a known donor would be the ultimate option. I have read enough about test tube babies and adopted children tounderstand that a person's biological background isimportant, it's something your child is likely to want to know about to understand who she is. I think this biological hang-upis a socially created 'need' -- there are cultures where biological parents aren't important and wherebiology isn't seen as creatingyour identity. But I live in a culture where biology  is  important, in which people search for their biological parents to understand themselves, and I have to assume that my children might feel this need as well. I don't think it's a 'right' to know your biological parents but I feel that taking theoption to knowaway from your children might create problems for them. And I don't want to do that.  At the same time, having children is a selfish act. I'm selfish enough to want to have them in the first place, so why wouldn't I be selfish enough to create the family I want to have, namely me, my gf, and our kids? Without anyone else involved. It would be more difficult, more trying to involve a known donor. The amount of trust you need to place in that person. Where do you find someone you  know  wouldn't demand access 'his' child in a way you wouldn't be prepared to accept?Someone who also would need to play the part of an 'important person' in your child's life -- not the role of a father, but someone your child knows and respects. I don't know a single male person I would place that much trust in.
