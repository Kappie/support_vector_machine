These were the questions and things we had to answer in the psalm:   I choose to worship...   Where?   When I'm feeling...   By remembering...   And this is my effort:   I will worship you when I'm down,   When I am feeling alone, or lost.   Wherever you take me Lord,   I will follow, and sing praise in your name.   For the mighty joy of the Lord's love will help   me to worship in whatever situation I am in.   I will remember how you told me to be patient,   but eventually you answered my prayers.   You brought him into my life.   Thankyou Lord.   I will remember your love for me,   and the atoning sacrifice of your son,   Lord Jesus Christ.   You helped me to grow in you, you made me,   you carried me, you saved me.   I love you Dad.   There is nothing like it, and no greater joy or comfort   than knowing you are saved and that the Lord is with you.   And I will worship in your name, forevermore,   through trials and tribulations,   I will always be there to worship you,   because that is the least of what you deserve,   and you are always there for me.   Amen.
