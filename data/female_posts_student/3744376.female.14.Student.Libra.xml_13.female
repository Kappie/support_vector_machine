I've realized how much I feel for someone.. this is the first time in my life i have actually thought about love and then said his name and it felt right.. i know he will probably never read this but i can't keep my feeling locked up and say i don't feel anything for him when i go to sleep at night hes the thing that i cant stop thinking about when i wake up he enters my mind.. when am i going to talk to him..... see him...he lives on the other side of the freakin world.. 2 yrs older.. i dont see how i can be in love with someone who i havnt even meet.. if i had a friend who said all of this stuff about someone and hasnt met this person , i would be like yeah right that is never going to work..i feel so sad .. i know this will never work out  how could I out of all people have met such a great guy.. he is so perfect.. everything he says makes me want him more and more.. if i could be with him for one night to be the one whos in your arms and who holds you tight...i could see if this is real. god i want to be with him so bad! I have never thought about any guy as much as i think about him.  bye
