However, if I bought a $40 scarf my boyfriend would beat the everliving piss out of me (see previous references to my $30 coach keyfob...it was a JACK RUSSELL!).  Anyhow, the price finally dropped to $20 and it was nowhere to be found cause all the crackpots like me want it.  This morning I spent 1 hour at work calling all the Gaps in a 15 mile radius (thats 12 gaps for those of you not in the know).  Finally, Linda, the glorious little elf at the Gap in Rye, NY had it.  Its on hold for me, and today, it shall be mine...well, Christmas morning after mommy gives it to me it shall be mine.  Wooooooooooooooooo!
