I guess what I like is how it laughs at me, and reminds me of what a huge undertaking it is to ever try to express something in words.  Honest, authentic emotional expression can get places words can never go... anyone who ever felt slightly let down when someone said 'I love you' can attest to that.  The words are nice- but  show  me. I want to know for sure, and the best way to know something for sure is to have it lived out in front of me- raw emotion: crows feet on smiling eyes, impatient foot tapping, sighing lovers in union, embarrassed blushing.  Words can draw a circle around these things, but they are so inadequate , and so barely come close most of the time. It's kind of a joke to try to devote one's life to them, because ultimately they'll just betray you and mock you when you need them most. I think this happens because we all have very personalized definitions for the really important words (trust, commitment, passion, joy, et al) that we haven't even tried to figure out for ourselves- so when someone says something to us, what we hear is so often something completely different. Mwah ha ha... them words... thems elusive, sneaky scoundrels they are.   Ironically (or is it just unfortunate coincidence?),  words are the best hope we've got . In each of our ultimate aloneness, aside from raw emotional expression (which has its own problems with our assigning meaning, misreading each other with our own narcissistic evaluations, et al and is beyond the problem this blog will address today at least), all we've really got are our words to bridge that gap. Words and hopefully a whole lot of hope. So we better choose them well, and what better thing to devote one's life to than communication, which equals hope: that we aren't so alone in the universe after all, that  there is a small chance we might someday understand and be understood .   So I guess it's hope that keeps me coming back to words, and lots of it when I read that DuChamp quote and think to myself mwah ha ha... so wrong he is.  I want to defy him, defy his certainty ; his conviction is obvious in the quote (" absolutely no  chance for a word  ever  to express  anything ..."- his generalizations are preposterous and wonderful) and he boils my blood and moves me to act. I want to write to prove him wrong, show him that we aren't ultimately alone, that  we don't live and die as lonely ghosts , that we have tools that give us at least the  potential  to connect profoundly, and if only we took the time to become adept at using those tools,then  there is a world of depth and union to behold . And that prospect inspires me to go on writing, and that is one small reason I love that quote so much. Thank you.
