Sure, some of my recent stuff hasn't been perfect, but neither has it been the shit that many have said. Critically, it's all become a bit of a crapshoot. The critics thought I was a bum when I started out and they think I'm a bum now."  Said John Carpenter, the maker of a number of Bad Films such as Big trouble in Little China, Ghosts on Mars from 2001: "You don't stand a ghost of a chance" and The Fog from 1980: "What you can't see won't hurt you...it'll kill you!" All recommended!
