Just for fun or getting paid, everyone loves getting laid.  I don't know where he got that from but it's hilarious. So, I had an interesting weekend. Saturday: Went riding for..... ever lol. Sunburned, and HOT out there. And it was only 80*! What will I do when it's 100* and still as humid? Sunday: Went to the Russell's house for an Easter party. Why did I have to sit at the KID table AGAIN? lol. That always happens to me lol.  Monday: Well today I went to the movies with my mom and sister and we saw The Prince  Me.... Yah, it was, umm, thrilling.  Luv lotz n lotz, Philly Willy
