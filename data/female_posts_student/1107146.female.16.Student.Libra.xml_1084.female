Oh, and Will, if you're going to make fun of spelling, you need to check your own (knoledge?) But seriously, you play soccer?  Yeah, you see how well I know him, and I consider him a good friend.  We all tease him, but we all (even Rosie, deep down) love him.  But yeah, he could teach the classes with all he knows, which, by the way, is more than the teachers (especially the Robo-bitch, right, Will?)  Wow.  I just looked back at my post.  I kind of went parenthesis happy, did I not?
