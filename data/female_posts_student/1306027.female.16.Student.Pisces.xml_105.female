It's been educating to say the least, and at most, feels like a review. Some of the stuff covered is new for me so that means I gotta pound it into the back of my head so I can recall it for the S.A.T. You may be thinking, " O gosh golly gee! That sounds like much big fun!" Well, it's not. Anyways, On with the entertaining story of the day:  Stupid Customers.  Now, as most of you know, I happen to work in the fast food industry. Sucky day job yes, but it pays enough to keep me interested. Well, as you may or may not know (from my constant complaining of just about everything) my place of employment has a hard time committing to the realization that a restaurant can not be run on one worker and one manager between the times of 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. It is virtually impossible unless you are completely dead (dead in the sense that you have no customers). Well, as luck would have it, I was stuck on a closing shift exactly like the one stated above. Unfortunately, we were far from dead.  Things were going well up until about 8:30. At 8:30 we started to get a wee bit busy in the drive-through. I made sure to tend to all the whims of the crappy drivee's and was distracted from my cleaning.. (I.E Sweeping the Floor) Now, on closing, Manager's have to pull the registers and count the moneys and yadda yadda. So the manager is usually M.I.A for at least 20-30 mins (that's about 7-10 minutes per register). Well, after my micro drive-through rush, I turned around only to find that there were now 5 people in line up front. So, I went to take their orders. The one couple in front wanted 4 donuts and 2 sandwiches. I got the donuts, then I went to make their sandwiches. As they stood there watching me, they noticed that no one came rushing out to save me from the wills and terrors of the late night customers. "Where's your help??" asked the guy. "Your looking at it!" I less-than-cheerfully replied. I was trying to get done in a hurry so I had messed their sandwiches up. They told me just to switch the tops and I did so, got their sandwiches wrapped, and went back up front. By this time, 2 people had already walked away from the line.  I got the next order done fairly quickly because it was only one item, and then I moved on to the next customers.....  (Dun dun dun...)  Everything was going well. I had asked them the all to important question "For here or to go?", and I had gotten most of their items. Well, the lady had asked me for a  strawberry chocolate regular tart . Make no mistake, this is what I heard her say. So I rang her up for exactly that. I had already gotten their money and was reaching for that item and I realized that we were out of strawberry chocolate tarts..So I looked up and asked her if I could get her a regular one instead. She blinked, and then said- " NO, I WANTED THE CHOCOLATE CREME PIE TART " and so I said, "ok". Then I went to reach for a chocolate creme pie tart. She then asks me if I charged her for the strawberry one and I said, "Ma'am they cost the same amount". She starts to get irate and points her finger down at the glass case. She tells me that that certain tart costs 79 cents and says that she wants her money back.   So I call out to my manager and update him on the situation. "This lady ordered this, but really wanted this, and so now she wants a refund of her money. She needs 50 cents back."  The lady then goes off on this whole ordeal about how I didn't give her correct change and how she wanted 60 cents back straight away. My manager re-rang her order only to find out that the chocolate pie tarts were the same price as the strawberry ones, and told her. She shook her head and demanded her 60 cents. The manager tried to explain that she wouldn't get exactly that back because of the eat in tax and still she complained and demanded her 60 cents back.   "I want my money back because that stupid kid rang it up wrong!"  60 cents! OMG! 60 FRIGGIN CENTS! Over 60 cents that lady belittled me in front of the entire store.   I was pissed. And then the night lady walks in and says that the place looks like a mess. WELL I WONDER FRIGGIN WHY! God. People make me sick.  Yea, so that was my story. I was ok until I got up this morning and read my email. Apparently, I have been giving people funny looks. GOOD FREAKING GRIEF PEOPLE! Just leave me alone!  Anyways, this day does end on a good note. I got my paycheck and it was 283$. Woot! I put 70 in the bank, 50 went to tithes, and the rest I used to buy my spiffy new 4.0 megapixel digital camera.   Shopping therapy rocks.  And that concludes my complaining and updating of my life for the day. I hope you enjoyed.
