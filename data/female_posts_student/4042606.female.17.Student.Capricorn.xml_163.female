Mute came home today from his friends house to find that the mailman dropped it off in his mail box. Mute said he didn't like it at first, but after listening to it for a while, he told me they had some good qualities. Of course I knew this, that is why I sent it to him in the first place.  The   urlLink Lostprophets   are probably one a band that I enjoy quite a lot. It is very embarrassing to admit this though, because of their "fake punk-rock" image they acquired. I don't want to like them, yet I am compelled to. Just like Muteman is.
