I havn't really been doing anything, just hanging out at home, cleaning, talkin to people on the phone and on msn, riding my horse, and yea.  ah..it sucked, cuz on my way home from feedin the horses, I began thinking of some really sad things, like if some of my friends died, or if my brother would die, and then I began to think of my Great Grandma who died last year, and then I was thinking of a horse that died that I liked, and then I just kept thinking of all this other stuff that made me sad, and I started to cry, cuz of all the freakin crap of the past, even tho they may seem like nothing to some people, the choice(s) I made costed(is that a word?)me some things. So yea...  ok, so to get away from the sad part of my day/week or wateber,  I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL CHRISTMAS BREAK!!!!  yAyAyAYaYaYa!!!! That's when Z (Zack)is comin to visit! I friggin' can't wait!!! ah...I miss him   sooooo   much...Ryan too.   Well Imma depart now, so howdy to all those ppl who read my blog...it's rather sad...considering no one comments and yea. Oh well, adios!
