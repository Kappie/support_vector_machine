So, I think I've decided to just get his number from Greg and give him a call and see if he wants to go hang out.  He sorta asked me to go see Passion with him tonight, but it was very open-ended and he never closed the deal, so I just let it go. I fully intended to ask him in person today, but Chris was hanging around, and I didn't want to say anything to him with Chris around.  *sigh*  Okay... that's all for now...
