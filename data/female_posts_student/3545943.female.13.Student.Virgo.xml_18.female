But a draft.  Or draught, as they say in that funny ol' land I love so dearly.  So if I randomly use British spellings, don't hit me, people.  I just love them.  But I digress.  So for quite a while now, about a month, I think, the word 'escape' has been prodding me.  I want to write a song with the title Escape.  I know what kind of voice I want to sing it and I know basically what I want it to be.  But I cannot write it.  It won't be written.  Not yet.
