Suitcases of memories, Time after time  Sometimes you picture me  I'm walking too far ahead You're calling to me,  I can't hear what you've said  You said go slow  I fall behind  After my picture fades and darkenss has turned to gray watching through windows or wondering if i'm ok secrets stolen, all from deep inside your drum beat's off time...
