Then after school Carol, Danielle, Sarah, Kate, Mike, James, and Billy all went to Ward's and got ice cream and then we went to Palm Springs mini golfing. It was so much fun. Carol, Mike, and I thought we went to the wrong mini golf place because noone was there for a while. We thought everyone got lost but they didn't. In mini golfing I got a 47. Which isn't to bad. The other team cheated though! Then after mini golfing Carol, Mike, and I went and got soda and chips from Eckerds and Gavin's cousin Amanda was there. So I talked to her for a couple of minutes. She invited me to her and Gavin's graduation party but I don't know if I'll go. (probally not) Then everyone went back to Mike's house and played pool for a while and then played basketball. The girl's team was the awesomest team ever. (even though we lost) Danielle hurt her finger (sad face). I hope your finger feels better Danielle! Then after a while I went home.   Today - My cousin Greg got married. So I went to Oriskany for the wedding. I like weddings. There's always a good supply of cute guys there. lol Then after that we went to Applebee's and then I drove home.  So later tonight my cousin's daughter Makenzie and my other cousin's kids Dominic and Aubree are going to be here. So I'm going to be watching them I guess. Oh joy.   And then tomorrow I'm doing absolutely nothing. And I probally won't get asked to do anything either because that's just the way things happen. I hate not having plans sometimes. I get insanely sad when I don't do anything on weekends for some reason. I guess it's because I know most of my friends are off hanging out with their good friends and I'm not doing anything. Oh well. Hopefully this summer I will get a car so I can go places.  2 more days of school left. I don't know if I'm excited or sad. Probally a little more excited right now. Summer=more freedom=more fun. But then again summer could =loneliness which = boredom which = depressedness.  Listening to: [Counting Stars by Sugarcult]  Hey, I wanna crawl out of my skin Apologize for all my sins All the things I should have said to you Hey, I can't make it go away Over and over in my brain again All the things I should have said to you  [Chorus:]  Counting stars wishing I was okay  Crashing down was my biggest mistake I never ever ever meant to hurt you I only did what I had to  Counting stars again   Hey, I'll take this day by day by day Under the covers I'm okay I guess Life's too short and I feel small  [Chorus]  Counting stars again Counting stars again Counting stars again Counting stars again Counting stars again
