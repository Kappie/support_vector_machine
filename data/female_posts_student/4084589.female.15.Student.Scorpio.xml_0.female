Now, I laugh to myself and say, "Oh, I'll just get it back." And then I try. And try. And try. And then I realise I cant cuz  BLOGGERS A BLOODY FUCK !      Okay calm now. I'll get Jerry the Board back. (just named it jerry, you didnt miss out)   So I had a pretty boring day. Mainly because it ended at 2pm. Everyone's in school or studying here. Internet is my only friend. Jeez, I sound like a major social outcast there.     Oh god, she's blabbering.    I'm blabbering and talking to myself.   Will go talk on MSN or Friendster now.   Friendster's kinda lame now but thats a whole new topic .     Go.    Aight.Aight. I'm gonna focus on Jerry and his retrieval.
