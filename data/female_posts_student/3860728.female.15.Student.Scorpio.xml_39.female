BLONDES ARE NOT THE ONLY DUMB ONES.. i am a brunette/red head and today i proved blondes aren't the only stupid ones. My dad's friends came over. One friend brought his two daughters, another brought his son. One of the girls, the boy and i decided to go swimming. Everyone left to buy food. EVERYONE. we stayed and talked and finally decided to go skinny dipping. They dared me to go first. me being the person that i am, i went first. After about 45 minutes the cars started pulling up and we got dressed. The nosy neigbor children happened to be spying on us over the fence and saw only me take my top off. They called my father... he was very pissed, but thankfully he's not one for discussing things about my 'body'.. yes it is embarrassing, but hey.. its life.
