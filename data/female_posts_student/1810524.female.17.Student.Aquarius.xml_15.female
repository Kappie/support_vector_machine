But i warn u in advance its complicated n wierd!..but anywayz! hmmm ive been tryin to work out how honest to be and wot i wanna share with the world and wot im not, but i think ill just see how it goes from here. atm i hav so much to say and get of mi chest, i just dunno where to start- as  pink  and  linkin park  said- im  numb ! one thing u will notice already^^ about me is i tend to refer to songs and lyrics alot coz i feel they express true emotions and makes it easyer to show personal feelings....... but thats just me! ok i think that will do for now!  xxx
