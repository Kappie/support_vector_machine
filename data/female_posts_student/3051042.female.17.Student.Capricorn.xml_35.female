Digital poetry for the blind:  Sex is a sinister something Poured into a vat of confusion Sex is a surreal socialization Beautifully contributed to a realization That when he lays me down I dream of someone or something A situation that can be contrived From a fantasy, Romance, you see, A controversy that involves you Sex is a brutal mistake Where lovers make way To an ocean of remorse Sex is a regretful misgiving Where living is just as it seems The breeze flying in through the window My hair whipping and tumbling for self Rules are meant to be broken And take this gift as a token Of the sex we'll never have My mistake is one worth self loathing And I'd scream one thousand "I love you's" to the sky Kiss reality goodbye And just as fast as I'd take off my clothing You'd push me away Faster than the day That laps were couches and thighs chairs A mess of hair, whipping, tumbling for self Sex is a misguided misunderstanding Where demanding for me A sick way to believe That you'd have another To be under covers And this would electrically enhance certain surroundings Turning blue eyes red, and brown hair black Sex is nothing but touching If you want it to be more I'd be willing But if certain people, certain places Are keeping virgin lips sacred I'm interested in making you happy You talk like life isn't thrilling These worshippers of untouched features are needed for killing Perhaps it won't undo or untie her From dragging the noose around your neck Higher and higher For her to kick you down from responsibility But if reponsibility Is for you to make me see That my fantasy Of you and me Would only die quickly Then I'd gladly back off Mixed feelings And checkerboard ceilings And a daylight-savings-time recliner Colonial Coney Island Diner And all the substances in between Sex is a riot of Nazis Conforming to one night stands And boys who are sons of a man Entitled D.O.G. reversed I've conversed And rehearsed And have waited for moments For me to grasp That this won't last Conversations of past Holidays spent here Sex is an exemption Redemption From day dreams of heartache And hair, whipping, tumbling for self Will forever forget me When sex is put on lay away  And he said no... *sigh* Looking for love in all the wrong places
