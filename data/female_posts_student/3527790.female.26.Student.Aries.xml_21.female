I felt NO pity what so ever for the poor Doctor Bovary who is unable to keep his wife happy. I loved how Emma searches and seaches for her true happiness and is "brave" enough for a woman in this period to search outside the boundries of her marriage. Women of that time did lead resitricted lives or so the history books would lead us to believe. I enjoyed that even though she met her own demise, partly due to her flighty character and her lack of proper education, she still had her own adventures seperate from the comfortable home she provided for her educated yet simple and unaware husband.
