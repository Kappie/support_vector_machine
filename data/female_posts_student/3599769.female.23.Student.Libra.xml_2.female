You know, the kind where you kick and scream like you did when your mom refused to buy you a candy at the store when you were like 5. *sniff* Although I can't cry yet, I need to be a home for that first, I wish I could just feel peace. And believe I've been looking everywhere for it. I'm trying really hard not to be consumed. I think peace just might be playing a morbid game of hide and seek. It's kicking my ass in this game too. I used to feel so wonderful, peaceful, and just plain happy. Knowing that after being at work all day we could come and do nothing. Or just cuddle, or go to eat and have drinks or go to the movies, or rent one, or again just do nothing together. ee, thats the greatest part of being a "grown up" you can do whatever you want when you get home from work. Not like before when your parents said no to everything because it was a school night. I wish I could just....ARHHHHHH, why am I so whiny. Well it is my blog and I will whine if I want to. I annoy myself. I just want go back to May of 2001 when me and you firsst started and start all over again. I just want to feel realxed and peacful. I just want to stop whining now.
