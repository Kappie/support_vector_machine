Mmm... my carmel machiato is super strong today, but this is the second time I've been here in the past 12 hours, and the second time I've orders a double carmel machiato, along with sitting in the same  seat.   And I'm not staring at some (probably 20-something) guy with a leather jacket, blue work shirt with white grid lines, jeals and black chuck taylor all-stars (hi-tops of course. I take that back, they're navy blue. I think he's gay. Oh well.  A geeky-looking man with khakis and a wind breaker just set his calculus book and calculator down next to me. So many guys, and I'm not even wearing make-up today, for christ's sake.  And on to other topics... Nick, he wants me to talk all the time but when I'm prepared to release information that I'm not too comfortable talking about, he usually leaves or is too busy with others. I wonder how this weekend's trip to Kettering will fair for (what feels like) the inexistant friendship of us. Lots of alcohol I'd assume.  Geeky-guy is writing on white computer paper to get his homework done. Very delicate hand writing compaired to the violent jolts of my hand flying up and down. I think 20-something-year-old has the exact same shirt that I've entitled "like a rhinestone cowboy." I don't know why, but watching people follow through with daily tasks can be interesting, sometimes depressing because it reminds me I have no life.  I've strangely lost track of my writing. I'm ready for the weekend to be here, and it's only Tuesday. Tomorrow's events include suffering through band, going to a counciling appointment during Art (second hour) to fix my course selection sheet, suffering through the rest of school and then hopefully going to get my hair done. My computer is at the store for repairs, prolly a virus or something, and then the information gets tossed onto my laptop, the parts are going to Nick up at Kettering in Flint. Well, back to work for me. For now, I'm out. As Paul would say, "Peace Out."
