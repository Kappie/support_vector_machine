Since we know there are at least 5 surgically altered and specially trained decoy Saddams running around, how do they know it's the right one?  The Canadian media have been airing this story continuously for over 1 h 30 mins so far.  Isn't it convenient that it would not be released until 8am EST when the capture supposedly took place at 2pm EST the previous day?  Too bad it isn't sweeps.  More to come...
