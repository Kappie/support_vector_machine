Today I read   Ella Enchanted   for the second time. I hadn't remembered much about it except for basic details. I really love that book. I haven't seen the movie but I feel a little uninterested by it. I read the description and it's totally different from the book. It makes me really angry. I mean, I know that I shouldn't be surprised by it. Most movies from books aren't similar. But it does disappoint me. I mean, suddenly the prince has an evil uncle who wants to take over the kingdom...the only thing similar between the two is the fact that her name is Ella and that she's cursed! *sighs* but then I realized, there was no hope for the movie from the beginning...it's a Disney movie. Not that I don't like Disney Movies...I do. But they are never close to the original stories. Well, I won't be totally closed minded about it. I will rent it and see how it is. I'm sure it's a cute movie.      So, I'm sort of lost about this whole blog thing. I still don't know how you get people to view it? Do they come by themselves or what? *grumbles* no one is interested in all my book grumbling! Eh, oh well...      My parents still haven't started reading me story to start editing it...ugh. Hello?! They made this rule that I couldn't publish it until they had finished editing it. Mom got mad because she was rushed last time. Well! I gave her time now! Hello?! Where is even one mark on the pages? Has she even taken a look at it? Has she even read the title? I don't think so. I don't really blame Dad. I mean...he's dealing with trying to find a job and that's been stressful for him. And I know Mom's work is hard, but couldn't she read like a page a day at least? That can't be that hard.      We're going on a cruise next week and she   promised   that she would start reading it but you know what? I bet they forget to take it? I just want someone, anyone to read it and tell me how it is. I worked   SO   hard on this and now it's just like...I can't get the final peice finished. *groans* this is so impossible.      Whatever, no one wants to hear me complain. Lol. That's about it in book news for today. If I   ever   get this stupid book released, I'll tell you.      Thanks guys! Bye!      ~Katrina
