I feel like I’m the only person here and looking for a partner to be with. Everyone I turn to for comfort seem to be fading rite before my eyes.   A friend once told me that I was no longer the lonely, timid girl I once was. That I was so strong, so sure of myself and that he was very proud of me. To see me where I was at, from where I once was, only proves to him that he was right about me. I sit back and asked myself, “What Happen to This Girl?”   I have so many things running through my mind rite now. Such as Sex, School, Money, Work, Alyssia, No Doubt concert, Britney Spear’s concert, friends, relationship, love and etc. There is only vision that’s planted into my mind. Many friends turned to me for advice and I didn’t know what to say. I did what I could, and if they didn’t like my advice oh well. But today it’s been bothering me, so I have to blog about it.   Love is just like a punishment, its only here to represent, so easily to come my way. Can real love survive? Love is a total concept that everybody goes through. Why? I dunno!!! Love is so short and forgetting is eternity. Jumping in with your heart and jumping out with your head. Jumping in and out isn’t wise.   Making decision with yourself is difficult but just be honest and be true to yourself. Its hard, who am I kidding? If decisions are made don’t look back. Don’t run away from yourself either. Life isn’t perfect, nobody is. The value of time is what counts the most.  If you’ve found that special someone take care of him/her. Hold on to that person tight and don’t let go.  If you misunderstood each other just talk things out. Communication is the only key.   Be sure to make mistakes, makes lots of them because there is no better way to learn. Who ever you choose don’t run away from it. Don’t chase it either, it will come to you when you lease expect it. Just be patience.   Man, I’ve been telling myself this over and over again but when am I going to let any guy into my life again? I know that one really great guy is waiting for an answer. Waiting for me to let him fly into my life. Waiting to start something serious with me.   All these time I’ve been searching and never finding the answer. I’m not ready for a serious relationship. I have too much issue to think of and to take care of. I still want you by my side just to help me dry the tears that I’ve cried. Give me some times to explore your world and show me what you are capable of. Allow time to reveal yourself to me. Let me enjoy your friendship for as long as faith will allow us. If it grows into something more beautiful then friendship then let it blossom.
