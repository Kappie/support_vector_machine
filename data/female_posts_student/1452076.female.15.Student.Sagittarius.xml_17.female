I wonder when I'll have that kind of dough to get myself a decent acoustic. Since I had just sold my year-old Takamine, he kindly lent it to me to play for Sabbath School. He's selling it sometime this week though, so I'd probably have to go look for another guitar. The ones in church are currently in a very crappy state. It's like they were horribly bashed up, with missing strings and broken bodies.  Yesterday night was the opening match (Portugal VS Greece) of the Euro Cup 2004 which will last for the whole month. (WHOOP!) Greece won 2-1, with Portugal managing to score her first and last goal of the game in the last 20 minutes. I fell asleep around 11pm while waiting for the match to start at 11:50pm. This information was provided by my friend Dawn at 1:35am this morning, after managing to wake me up. I'll probably watch the highlights of last night's match later at 5pm on Euro Channel 21. I think the match everyone will be looking forward to will be tomorrow at 2:35am (what unearthly time) where two great sporting rivals - England and France are pitted against each other. But until then, I shall stick to my resolution for today. That is to clear the pile of homework stacking up on my table.
