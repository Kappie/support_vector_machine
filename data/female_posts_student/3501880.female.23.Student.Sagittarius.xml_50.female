Okay, so there are only two of them, but up until last week, we really only have exchanged pleasantries as I have been coming and going from my corner "office". But now, they like to come back and talk to me and we use naughty words like "cunt" to describe the clients and things.   Within a short time, they have already told me how funny I am and how they are going to miss me when I go back to school next month. I love it when my ego is stroked so.
