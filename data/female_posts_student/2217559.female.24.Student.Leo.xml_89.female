Nils, Lisa and I headed to the Crystal Hotel around 1pm and just enjoyed the sun and pina coladas. I was exhausted when i got back from the ship and I took about a 2 hour nap before coming into work at 6. Then Lisa and I snuck away for a Martini in the Martini Bar. It was fun. She's so excited about going home - I don't blame her. i will be the same way in about 29 days. Sounds like a long time but it's around the corner.  So, we are trying to figure out where we will stay when we are in Austin. I am tihnking of renting hotel because I don't want to inconvenience anyone since we will be in during the middle of the week. I think i will figure something out. I am sure of it. Hmm.  PADDY! How are you my friend?   I got the greatest emails today from my friends around the world. Can you imagine - 3 emails from different sides of the world? One from Fotis in Greece, One from Daniel in the UK and one from Dave in New Zealand! I can't wait to visit all of these wonderful plces one day. I sat with tons of friends last night discussing how the new EU will affect there countries. Such interesting conversations, I swear.   Okay, I am fire - the sun kissed me today and burnt the hell out of my skin (even with 35 spf!). i need to go grab some dinner and then off to the cinema to watch "Monster" with Charlize Theron. I know I am way behind on my moves here.   Luv.
