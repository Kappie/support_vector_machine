(as if i'll even pass!) my curent review classes are only during weekends. sturdays at 1-5 and sundays at 8-5. in other words, my social life is ruined.  moreover, soccer varsity training is on fridays from 5:30-6:30 pm. like i've said, my social life is ruined. got 2 chapter tests for the coming week, a bunch of quizzes and assignments. and CAT's about to begin too. argh. hope my brain doesn't overload then suddenly explode.  and about that damned guy... i damn him some more!!!
