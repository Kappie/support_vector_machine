It's a really good, mellowed out, slow song. :D   Butterfly - Weezer  Yesterday i went outside With my momma's mason jar Caught a lovely butterfly When I woke up today Looked in on my fairy pet She had withered all away No more sighing in her breast  I'm sorry for what I did I did what my body told me to I didn't mean to do you harm Everytime I pin down what I think I want it slips away There it goes; slips away  Smell you on my hand for days I can't wash away your scent If I'm a dog then you're a bitch I guess you're as real as me Maybe I can live with that Maybe I need fantasy Life of chasing butterfly  I'm sorry for what I did I did what my body told me to I didn't mean to do you harm Everytime I pin down what I think I want it slips away There it goes; slips away  I told you I would return When the robin makes his nest But I ain't never coming back I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
