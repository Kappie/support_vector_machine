Oh wait, I watched a load of TV! Ok, so maybe that's a lie, I sat around the house doing nothing! Happy now?! AAARGH! I seriously need to get out of here, holidays always make me go crazy and then when I actually see real people I go all crazy and hyper! What's every one doing tomorrow? Oh wait, I've gotta go to a BBQ for the Queen's jubilee, fun aye? Eugh. Any way I'm gonna do a phone around now so I can arrange something for Tuesday so bubi!
