Anyways, not much has been going on, my best friend and I have been hanging out the past two days, haha, great fun. And right now I'm getting ready to go outside and tan a litte, my birthday party is this friday, so I gotta look good ;-). Then I have to get ready for youth tonight. My youth pastor is out of town and my brother is preaching tonight! It makes me happy, I love my brother and I love it when he preaches. But yeah, that's the deal for today. Oh! my bruise on my shin from the last game of Communist Church is MASSIVE. I'm so excited! lol    One more thing, now that I have had time to digest the movie "The Village" I have figured out my thoughts on it.  DO NOT READ THE BELOW UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE OR ARE PREPARED TO HAVE THE MOVIE SPOILED FOR YOU ...    It was all in all a good film, M. Night Shyamalan did a good job in writing and directing this film. The twist at the end was a clever idea, even though I walked out of the theater angry because of it. I think I was mad because going into the movie, you think you are about to see a horror film about these creatures and this village who are no longer able to keep the peace between themselves, and you that the creatures are going to attack and it will end up being some huge war between the two, like signs, where the good guys win and the movie will be over. But instead you get this huge twist at the ending and you find out everything is fake and it's just about these people who are fed-up with the world and want to create their own life and their own world, and have the money to do it without being disturbed...and I when I go into a horror movie, I like to walk out of a horror movie. Not some weird physchology experiment movie. So now that I am over it, lol, I can look back and see it's not a bad movie afterall. And I have to say, I'm kind of happy that it was all fake, because I was let down by M. Night when I saw what the creatures looked like. I thought he could do WAY better than that.
