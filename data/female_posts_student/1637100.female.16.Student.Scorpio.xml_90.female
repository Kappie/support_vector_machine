It flies on wings When you're having fun And drags its feet When there's nothing to be done  There is too much to do And never enough And to get some more Is extremely tough  Arriving at school late Dressed less than nicely Is definitely a result Of not planning wisely  Missing a curfew And coming home late A lecture from parents Glaring as they wait  If making priorities Is a skill that you lack You'd better learn fast Cause you cannot turn it back.
