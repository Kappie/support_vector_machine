It took us two and a half hours to get her moved from her room to the den so she could sleep on the floor and have me sleep on the couch.  laehtglethgl ... I woke to the sounds of the phone ringing and Derek going "How has your day been?"... " Short. "   New movie viewings! I watched  The Perfect Score , a very true movie about the SAT, or as they call it "Suck Ass Test," as well as a movie called  Love Letters , which I really liked. Turns out it was based on a play, which I really want to find now. We also finally got Derek to watch  Love Actually  which I have practically memorized. Colin Firth...  me-ow .   It's three in the morning, and I'm listening to Rufus Wainwright.  Life is odd .    GRANDPA HAS LEFT THE BOONIES. Thank God. That man was driving me crazy. We ran out of things to talk about when I was... well...  born . The great part was that Derek didn't come over til after he left. Well done ;). Grandpa's still ticked about Derek calling this czech food that he likes "wallpaper paste." Personally, I thought it was hysterical.   My mom saw Brad on Thursday! EEEEE. Must go and see him myself... except I look like shit. Stupid pink eye. Except, it's not so much pink eye as "changing eye color syndrome," for pink becomes red, and red becomes a sort of ying yang between the two previous colors.    Must find out AP scores. Must, must, must . It will determine whether I'll do English or Music. I have to decide  somehow .  I had a really bizarre dream last night. I dreamed that Playhouse on the Sqaure was putting on  Wicked , and that Amanda (best bud up in Chicago) and I saw it. Somehow or another, we were going down a toll road which looked like Humphreys, and these two girls were in the back of the car. I saw Brad as we were getting into the car, and proceeded to swoon as Amanda drove. When we turned back to look at the two girls, one of them said "Oh you mean Brad, the guy who I totally made out with last night?" I panicked. And somehow, the girls also managed to tell us that they were related to the Hilton sisters. They even looked like the Hilton sisters. Which means they were pretty. Stupid pretty people.   Our country is 226 years old as of today.  Hurrah for the Declaration of Independence . As well as extroardinarily long posts.  I wish you all a lovely 4th of July. May you all have someone with which you can spend it. I wish I did. As I listen to Oliver James, and the Pointer Sisters, I bid you goodnight/morning... I have yet to get that straight :).   Au revoir.
