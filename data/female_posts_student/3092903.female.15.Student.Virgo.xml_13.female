That seems dumb,but the reason I say that is because when a day is bad, the next one has to be better, even if it is bad too, logically its not as bad as the day before, unless you make it that way. I understand I was late. I didnt prepare enough time to get there during the rain, so I took the whole "Iwouldnt want to spend time in hell with you" speech. I tried to get over it and do my very best the rest of the time. Inf act, I got so caught up in doing things right, that when Joseph told me to move a bench from the table so Kevin could get it, I accidently did it after Mr. Davis told us to do something did it. Thatwas really dumb of me I know, because I shouldnt listen to other people anyway, and I should have thought about what I was doing. As much as I wanted someone to look bad at the moment with me, when Mr Davis asked who told me to do that, I just said 'nobody' I figure being the better person means just taking all the blame instead of taking someone down with you. I just cant stand that I looked stupid in front of people I have a lot of respect for. Then I got yelled at again because someone on the other side of the house was asking me a question and I stupidly answered them  just  at the wrong moment  again . Kim said she would have cried, and I still have that feeling in my throat, but I have more determination in me than that to let one bad night get in the way of the whole goal. Even if no one has faith in me and everyone hates me, I'm still going to give it my all. My parents dont understand that. Him yelling at me really made my mom upset and my dad asked why i just did nt just stop taking his classes and drop out. The answer to that is simple for me. I dont do theatre for Mr. Davis or for anyone else. And even if he doesnt put me up on that stage ever again like he threatened to tonight (probably like I deserve) I'll still be involved. And I also have a responsibility as an officer that I am not going to slack on. So even if Mr Davis thinks I'm good for nothing, I'm still going to do my best to prove my devotion to what we do. I still think I am going to cry, and I really dont want to go back. I really just hope I dont get yelled at anymore.
