My family and I of course went to Medieval Times as a sort of, belated father's day gift since my brother was out of town last weekend. It was fun, We were royalty and the yellow team. Fun, fun, fun. Our team didn't win though. Bummer! Oh well, still a fun day. I didn't get the shoes I wanted at the mall because I ended up not liking them but I got a different pair instead which I love.   Diane and I are talking now and we're planning to go to Great America. I'm so excited! I haven't been there in forever!!! YES! :) And now, I must go do my homework. Heh. Sad....
