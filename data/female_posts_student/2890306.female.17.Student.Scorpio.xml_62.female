How thrilling, I know. Do they have an EA? Ebayers Anonymous? I think I am going to need that quite soon.   Hey, let's get together tomorrow, okay all? A movie at someone's house or something? I need to get back into the swing of things.   I think that if you read this, Geoffrey darling, you should call me. I don't really mind the time. Just call my cell phone...it's freshly charged.   Until the sun rises again. Yes, that's it.
