Yesterday went shopping with Laura. Twas fun. Got a new shirt at Maraposa, it's white, so I'm thrilled. Got some rainbow shoelaces at Bluenotes, and oogled a Care Bear shirt that I want so bad...it's pink and has Tenderheart on it like my last one did...So when I get enough cash I'll go get it. Hopefully before I go to Edmonton, cause that would really be righteous to have a new Care Bear con shirt. Got two new bras at La Senza, so that was pleasing. Went to A sound, drained my bank account (nearly) for a present for Laura (Treasure Planet). After that, it was almost 4, and I had to keep her out for at least another hour so we went down to Beacon Hill Park. Bunch of people called me on my cell too, but Laura kept thinking it was Nick, so I didnt say anything to convince her otherwise :P We walked around the park, talked to ducks and stuff, then went to the petting zoo, which was sooo much fun. There were peacocks with their butt feathers extended, and pigs, and peacocks, and ducks, and peacocks, and sheep and cows and rabbits, and peacocks, and baby emus, and baby guinea pigs, and goats, and peacocks....sooo much fun. :) Then we sat in a tree and talked for a bit and watched people play golf while we waited till it was time to go. Saw a black squirell when we were coming back. Very exciting. Laura's mom picked us up and drove us to her house....  Then it got exciting, because of course there was the surprise party. I didn't know how to get into the house, the front door is hard to open and makes a lot of noise, I saw people downstairs, so I wasn't sure if I could go in through there, and then I remember the deck, so I go up there. Matt and Tom were hiding there, so I ran up to hide with them. Laura saw me outside, and the decorations in the living room, and went out to the deck to see why I was there, and Matt and Tom jumped up yelling surprise, and then everyone else came out of the bathroom and scared her good :P It was tres awesome. We opened presents and talked and laughed and stuff. Laura got a lot of candy. We went outside to eat and we started to play silent football, then moved to the front yard cause we got so noisey. Oooooh boy was that sooo much fun. :P Tom kept speaking out of turn cause he wasn't used to not being the dictator, Nick kept doing the nmore HILARIOUS things, as well as Matt, it was hard NOT to keep from laughing...Eventually a headache took over and I was feeling gross :( So I tried to take a nap outside, and later inside when everyone came back. Finally I crashed on Laura's INCREDIBLY COMFORTABLE bed, and Nick came and sat with me to make sure I was ok..he sat there the whole time I was sleeping there, which was really sweet. Then he went outside to play hide and go seek tag, and I woke up and joined them. I was really cold, so I had one like,4 or 5 coats and sweaters. I watched them play for a bit, then I joined in too. I was never caught :P So awesome. Then we went inside to watch Robin Hood Men in Tights..I read People instead and made out with Nick until I had to go. It was an ammmmmmazing day.   Plus Nick was wearing blue jeans, a blue over shirt (that I evetually stole and wore cause I was cold, looked kinda sexy on me :p) and a black t shirt..and looked SO HOT. RAWR. Hard to keep my hands off of him.   Today I went to church to sell the blessing beads Marya made for me to sell. I got to keep all the profits too... they all sold very quickly, and people just randomly donated money too :) Someone even bought a necklace for me which was soo  soo sweet. Mom made me donate all the money to the youth group though >  Tomorw marks two whole months with me and Nick, so eee!! I'm very excited. Then he's leaving for Calgary on the 15, and comes back on the 19...Mom leaves on the 19 for Edmonton and I'm supposed to go over to Nick's on the 20 to say my goodbyes and such..Then I leave on the 21, and come home late afternoon on the 24...Very excited..Much still to do, with watching Ayla, and buying cameras, and organizing touch groups and spirit committee and everythign else.....plus there's the PE trip on the 2....5? I think..so that means Laura, Matt and Dan are gone until the 29, I think. Or 30. Busy month!!!!! I'll post when I can, and especially cause I think I'm coming down with Mono...soo...Catch ya all on the flipside! Hope you all enjoy the new layout too, I'm still deciding about it.
