The weekend started for me on Thursday night though and it was a lot of fun - Jen, Lisa, Megan, Kristi and I went out to dinner at Z-Tejas and then went out on the town. We had a ton of fun and both Kristi and Jen were just so freake dout because they met "Cat Osterman."  I am sure a billion of you out there are like, "Who the hell is that?" Don't worry, I have provided you a link with all the Cat Osterman information you could want. The link is above. It was neat and even more meaningful after I googled her named and saw exactly how cool this girl really is.  She's the only college chick on the US Olympic Women's Softball team. Go Cat!  The remainder of the weekend was a lot of fun. Friday was definitely jello shot night and we had tons of fun on the river yesterday. The weather was perfect yesterday and we had lots of fun floating down the river. Of course, we lost 3/4ths of our beer after the first rapid but fortunately we had some great help from Jennifer and Nick scoring some beers at the end of the trip.  I don't think I have laughed so hard in a very long time. The family enjoyed spending together and I personally was really excited to have Jen with me. My family just loves her to death.  I got cranked up after being on the river all day and I wanted to go out to Gruene Hall alst night. unfortunately, everyone else was very sunburned and tired from the days events. I had to shut my honky tonk down and earlier than I had hoped but I was thankful when I woke up this morning with out a headache!  The drive home today sucked sooo bad.  I am sick of all of this rain! I don't think it is ever going to stop! I actually had to pull over on the side of the road for about 10 minutes to let this huge storm pass. I thought there was going to be a tornado for sure!!! Hahahah.   I will post pictures as soon as we get them developed. Much love. Stay dry. Shell
