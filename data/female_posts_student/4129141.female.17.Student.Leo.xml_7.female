Plus, I had to listen to sucky Phil Collins in the car because my mom liked him. I had a pretty decent,pretty good day despite all that.Before work, at JVS(The program where I get to try all these different jobs) had a bathroom with plenty of toilets, one of them in which SOMEONE(Not my co-worker) left POOP AND URINE IN WITHOUT FLUSHING- EXTREMELY GROSS!!!!!!!! I had to flush using my shoe-covered foot, and it was a successful flush- but a little bit was still left in there. And one person went to the bathroom next to me, urined in the toilet and FARTED WITHOUT SAYING EXCUSE ME!!!!!! Jeez, when you fart, you say "Excuse me." WHAT'S SO HARD ABOUT THAT?!?!?! I'm glad my coach said I did a good job at work. I get to pat myself on the back now- YAY!!!!!!!
