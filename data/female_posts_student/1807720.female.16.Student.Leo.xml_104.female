Then we went back to Edi's house where we stayed there until about 1:00 AM and then he drove us all home.  Yup that was my night.  Chels sure flirted alot with Edi though for having a boyfriend, but whatever it's really none of my business.  So lets just say that when everything goes wrong and everything breaks - that's my house!  Ok so we got a new washer cause our old one sucked ass and well my dad flew in this weekend and he was setting it up and forgot to remove something so like for half an hour it sounded like the house was going to blow up.  It was actually really funny.  Then in the evening we had water pouring into the basement by the comp from like the ceiling.  That's when we discovered that the diswasher was leaking from the bottom so now they have to buy a new dishwasher cause it's already been fixed like 500 000 000 times, we could have had like ten new dishwashers by now.  Then my printer wouldn't work again and we just bought a new one, so there is a problem with the connection between the comp and the printer.  So now we have to buy cord thing that connects the two.  So yeah basically my house is falling apart, not like that is anything new though.  Melissa and Ben are coming later for dinner.  It was Ben's birthday on tuesday, so we invited them for dinner tonight.  We aren't having any cake though because we are all trying to loose weight for the wedding, so no cake.  We will probably just have fruit for dessert, it's way better anyway.
