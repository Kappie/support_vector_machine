Now everybody, almost everybody thinks I’m pretty that nobody seems to take me seriously anymore, nobody bothers to see how deep and intellectual I can be.    Well, being beautiful has its price.    Guess you can’t have your cake and eat it too.    *nuninu*    I have so much faith in people.  People have disappointed me so many times and yet I still trust people, sometimes to the detriment of my life.  When I enter into a discussion about life I am not surprised that I tend to shock people.  I don’t exactly expect them to have the same views that I have, why should we?  That’s what individual differences are for, diversity of opinion.  When I talk about sex, I take it educationally.  When I talk about men, I mean to diss but I express hope.  When I talk about homosexual relationships, I don’t talk about permanence, I talk about respect.  I respect other people’s opinion much as I want to be respected for what I believe in.  I keep a good idea about other people in my head as much as I want to be remembered in a good way.  I’m not the most perfect person in the planet. I have flaws.  I’d like to think that sometimes, it’s the person’s imperfections that endear him to people.  I just hope that’s what people think whenever they think of me.  But then again, I put too much faith in people and they have always disappointed me.  So much for man being inherently good.  How about inherently evil?  I’m just glad that I have friends that think I’m good enough, people who think I’m smart and sensual at the same time; people who know my flaws and live with them.  I know I can be a pain at times.   I  AM ME.
