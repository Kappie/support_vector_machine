She leaves for Willamette really soon too which makes me very sad. Bleh.     On to other news...so for those of you who would like a new overview of my life and friends and such... *I know that I have already posted this on my livejournal site for those of you who have seen that, but I am starting over* Ok so my family---       My Mom (Karri-- Never call her Mrs. Barker)--- Irish, trains doctors for practice software, is into pottery and scrapbooking.       My Dad (Pat-- Never call him Mr. Barker) --- Native American-- I look the most like him - {Im the only one that got his dark hair} HVAC technician, loves restoring cars and other productive things.       My Sister (Kaeli)--- Blonde haired, glasses, eighth grade, um... is very "girly" unlike me... In some ways we are polar opposites. But when I go through my short spaz attacks of "lets do each other's hair or paint our nails" she's there.      My Brother (Lucas)--- Short, 9, almost 10 years old... knows more about cars, engines, and gears than I ever wish to know myself... good little kid.       So thats my family basically. Save for my schizophrenic grandmother. I dont think she's actually been diagnosed with it but I'm convinced that's it. And my dad has a huge family--- he's the youngest of 8- it took me until last year to finally get all of my aunts' names straight. Ok moving on.       I dont feel like making a list of my friends right now particularly but maybe at some other point in the not-too-distant future. Ok Im searching through my mind for something to blog on about, because if I cannot think of anything to write about then I'm sure that this was a waste of an entry you see?     Phones. I hate how sometimes when you call a person's house their answering machine picks up immediately. And I dont know about you but I need time to prepare in my mind what exactly I'm going to leave as proof that I called their house. So if the answering machine picks up on the first ring I end up leaving a message that's usually somewhat like this:       "hi.... um... this is jaime and I was calling for Bob... NO! I mean Fred... and I was just calling to see um... what you're up to?? so could you uh... give me a call?? thanks"       And then once I hang up I realize that that person doesnt have my number and since I didnt even leave him one to call me back at, and so I left proof on their machine that I am a blabbering idiot. Lovely.       So if any of you get a message on your answering machine that is from me that seems to be quite a bit like the one above, know that it is not MY fault but your answering machine's fault. Fucking electronics.       No, I like the people's answering machines that take like TEN rings to get to the message. Like Andy's. I just call... and wait... and wait... and wait... and ten rings later or so I get to leave a well thought-out message on his machine. Well, sometimes. Not always. But at least I can be sure that he has my number.       Thats all I want to say about answering machines for now.      Hm... something to type about that I enjoy. Nah Im not in the mood. Later--- with my extended friends list I will write about something I like. For now, this is all.      :D
