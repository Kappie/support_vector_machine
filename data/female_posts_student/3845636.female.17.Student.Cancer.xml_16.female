(By JJ)       the truth is tearing up my heart i can't recognize this place the endless road without a stop sign can't even find a stranger this time...   why am i still holding back my tears in this loneliness there's nothing to fear every chord still seems a wonder how we could be together every time i ask if this would be the last...   why am i still talking to myself hoping that you will have the keys to my cell every song might calm the weather but it draws me deeper how do i get out of this i think i never will...   a crystal forming in the eye maybe this would be the last the winding path down my face till i begin to taste the bitterness inside...   why am i still holding back my tears in this loneliness there's nothing to fear every chord still seems a wonder how we could be together every time i ask if this would be the last...   why am i still talking to myself hoping you will have the keys to my cell every song might calm the weather but it draws me deeper how do i get out of this   i think i never will...     Hmn... just bought this cd by JJ. Wonderful music...by chance I found this song. The last track of the cd. It was 'love at first sight' kind of thing when I heard this song. haha... it can really describe my present feelings... my thoughts... my troubles and everything. The lyrics say it all...  Have been feeling really down lately... guess I'm quite a weak person.. although I keep reminding myself to stay strong regardless of any setbacks I face or any problems that comes into my way. However still... I can't help it. A person who drops tears easily... that's all I can say. But I'll recover... I'll stand up again. I will show them that I can make it. I will exceed their expectations of me. I'll tolerate everything... I'll definitely pull through.  Another pondering qns... is it wrong to accept the love and care from another person knowing that you may not be able to return the same amount. I know that such things cannot be measured... but in this case isn't love unfair? Or we should always shower our love unconditionally? there's a weird feeling running through me lately... Although I'm a perfectionist... but I realised that the world is not so perfect after all. I can try to make it one... but it takes 2 hands to clap and not everything will go according to your wishes. No one is perfect... yes... true. However... have I found the one that seems so perfect? Well, time MAY tell... I believe that alot of things are felt and words can never express it any better...
