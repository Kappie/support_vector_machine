I was pretty proud of myself when I was the first of the girls to volunteer to try it.  I figured if my sister can do it, maybe I can.  She made it look easy, but uh, it's not so much.  Somehow I was able to get up the first time, but my next attempts I was not able to get up at all.  I think I could've, but really the thought of being pulled by a boat on a wake board going fast kind of scares me.  It's not a nice thought to think I'm gonna hit the water, if I fall, at the same speed the boat is going.  Basically I'm afraid of getting hurt.  I'm just a big baby.  I did try though and I'm really happy I can say that.  I think I'll stick to dance, tennis, and swimming as competitive sports.  Not that I'm competitive at any of these things or good for that matter.  Anyway all the fun in the sun left me with soreness and sun burn, but it was definitley worth it!  Hope everyone had a safe and fun Fourth of July! Unfortunately, today is another day back to class for me leaving me with lots of reading.  The joys of getting an education!
