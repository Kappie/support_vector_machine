I do't really mean for anyone to read the meandering thoughts of a bored teenage girl anyways, and I'm dead serious. I like to think I'm writing for myself.  I didn't want to get out of bed this morning so I turned on my CD player and wrapped the blankets around my head. "Such Great Heights," oh sappiness.   More adventures on the road: I hate how every gas...dispenser? you know what I mean...beeps when you press a button or something. I almost take it as a personal affront, it's so hostile. BEEP Your receipt is ready, not that you haven't taken it out of the slot as soon as it got there...I filled up for Grandma today. Couldn't remember which side it was on so I tried one, failed and did some crazy maneuver that directed me to the other side. I almost left the cover open too, as I did yesterday. When I got out of my car, safely parked in the garage, I realized the 4runner still had the cap attached to the door, which was wide open. I started to pretend that those spots on the garage floor were gasoline and flirted with the idea of taking a match to them to see if I really was a leaking idiot. I didn't, but you know that. I don't like matches. It doesn't make sense to hold it up to keep it from burning to your fingertips.  So hello, it's 8 minutes past noon and I'm going to magically occupy myself until it's time to change into that oversized green shirt and white pants, put on the badge, the socks and the smile and go volunteer. Sigh. What a life.  My brother's computer is gurgling.  I have a tape of my CWOTO, yay. I want to listen to it to see if it's any good...college-worthy, perhaps? Who knows. I don't know.  On my third Echo Heron book since I'm really that demented.   You know, I really don't have to start packing yet until Friday. It's a drag.  Everyone's gone, how sad.  Here I laugh. You poor, self-pitying, bumbling creature.
