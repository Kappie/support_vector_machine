I even took a nap today when I got home today too, and I still feel like I could sleep for another couple of hours. Part of me is convinced that taking naps actually makes you MORE sleepy for the rest of the day.  Maybe if I forced myself to stay awake after class I wouldn't feel groggy--how ironic.  My room smells like a litter box.  What's scary is that I'm actually getting used to it.  Last night we had girl's accountibility group.  It was good during the study, but during the drive home, I had a lot of regrets about some of the things I said that evening.  Since all of us (except for Jamie) are either married or dating, we talked a lot about relationships.  I kept thinking about how Jamie was feeling and if she felt left out of the conversation.  I honestly can't tell if she resented the conversation, but she did ask some questions that related to her breakup with Alvin.  I felt like I was giving her a lot of unsolicited advice.  Instead of being helpful, I think I sounded insincere.  When I broke up with Jerry, I vowed that I would try my best to never make any of the single girls feel alienated for not having a boyfriend.  I know it wasn't intentional, but I often felt left out of the conversation or out of activities by couples during my single days.  When I was dating Jerry, I was one of those people who "rubbed in" the fact that I was dating someone--outright flaunting it.  Right after the breakup, I felt sad when I saw people holding hands or going places together, and wished that I was in a relationship too.  Now the tables were turned....These sad feelings gradually subsided as time passed and I became more comfortable with being single.  I promised myself that when I started dating again, I would do my best not to alienate those who are single.    Last night I felt like Jamie felt left out of the conversation, and I felt bad about going back on my committment.  I was IMing her just now and I asked her if she felt uncomfortable with our conversation.  She said she didn't but that she felt sad that she wasn't able to participate more in the dialogue.  From now on, I'm going to remember to be more sensitive to those that are single and not talk about Brandon unless they ask.  This is challenging because I love to talk about him and I'm so happy about our relationship.
