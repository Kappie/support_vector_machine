It's just that I'm bracing from being yelled at by mom as I drove off the freeway, at having to do two SATII math packets, at having a brainache while sorting through the 20-odd problems i missed.  But otherwise, I guess it couldn't be that bad--after all, it's a lazy Sunday, I've eaten already and I don't have anything ugly hanging over my head except maybe a possible journalism deadline tomorrow. And piano lesson.  Lauren: i'm trying to choose between mit, harvard and stanford  Oh man, the things we do. Haha, I almost wish I'd played some obscure instrument like the bassoon now. Which makes me wonder: a year from now, will I be bitter that Harvard didn't send me a thick envelope, like Sylvia? Or will I be fortunate enough to choose between three academic powerhouses? I don't get it, either. Sylvia is just the neatest, most down-to-earth person in the world. She's not that kind of rigid geek who can't even carry on a normal conversation. She, Andrew and I have had some silly ones that one day before the choir concert in orchestra. She gets a 1600, does ballet, orchestra, clubs...if anything, she's one of the people I try to mimic. But I'm overjoyed for Lauren, too. Haha, what a difficult choice she has now! This time next year I want to be beaming for myself. We'll see how that goes. Am I worth it? Am I good enough?  Sometimes I really have to wonder: why should I be accepted into Harvard over other students? Hm. I have competitively good grades. My SAT score needs minor adjustment, but it's not that far from perfect. I have yet to try my hand at the SATII's, but I think writing and lit should be ok. Math IIC is very, very questionable at this point, but maybe it's just like the way it was on SATI math, it just needs practice. I'll be editor-in-chief of the paper by next year, and that's four years of journalism. If Julia and Harrison are still coaching next year or if an overwhelming majority of my friends are doing it again, that's four years of MT, three as an attorney. AA and NHS, hopefully. Earth club, adopt a beaches, etc. Excelsior. Maybe 200 hours at the hospital before graduation. First violinist. UC Davis research, Harvard summer school. Golf, even though I hate it. But am I too much like Sabrina Chou? Haha, what if we both apply to Harvard early and they decide, well, Sabrina's two sisters have come through here, I think Sabrina's a better choice over Lydia.  I am too typical.  I just want so badly to make it big, though. It sounds so B-list starlet of me. More later, I think Abdul's coming to LA.
