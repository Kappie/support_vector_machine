I’ve learned that teaching doesn’t come without learning, talking doesn’t come without listening, and love never comes without sacrifice.  I’ve learned that all the trouble that come from every broken heart, every failed test, and every emotional break down, is only making us stronger, and preparing us for the people we will eventually become.  As I watch my friends and I go throughout the pain and heart break of our teenage years, I sometimes with I could turn time forward, so that every issue that we struggle with would be over and done with, but then I realize that all the struggles we are constantly facing, make us who we are.  Without the drama we face in our teenage years, we wouldn’t have any experience to live on, and no lessons learned from past problems.  I’ve also learned that there is nothing that makes the world right again, like laughing.  Everything that is wrong in the world, and every issue I am facing, is forgotten when I am laughing the day away with my friends.  I used to care so much what people thought.  But, I’ve realized, through a series of unfortunate events, that I need to be who I am, and people can just deal.  I would much rather be doing what I want, when I want, how I want, with a few close friends, than being someone I’m not, with a bunch of people who don’t care about me.  The person I am when I am with them, isn’t fun.  She’s dull, and boring, and not worth anyone's time.  If someone can’t love you and enjoy you the way you are, they aren’t worth it, at all.  Perhaps that is the most valuable lesson I have learned.  That love is a chance you have to take.  I know it’s hard, and I know it is a gamble, but when you finally find someone that you love so much, you can’t think about anything else, you can’t sleep, and you can’t wait to see, all the heart ache you have gone through in the past is forgotten.  So, to sum it up, you can’t get through out high school, or life for that matter, without pain, suffering, sacrifice, and stress, but when all the obstacles of a certain problem are over come, the everlasting rewards are forever satisfying.
