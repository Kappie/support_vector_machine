This was something that would only take about 20 minutes max, but those 20 minutes were pretty hellatious, let me tell you.  Picture scraping feces out of the crevices of a screaming child's rear, which was pretty much what my little babysitting adventure entailed.  This made me wonder why so many people longingly aspired to have children.  Why?  Why do people want to have kids so bad?  I know there's benefits to having children, but there's also a good chance that your kids will hate you no matter what.  Scraping feces out of the crevices of my children's asses does not necessarily mean that they won't resent me in the end.  If that's the case, then where do I sign up?  And to think people keep popping out those suckers like they're going out of style.  Don't get me wrong, I am not a child hater.  Kids are great; I want kids someday.  What I really hate is the people who have kids that are not fit to.  Some people just shouldn't breed.  But it's the people that shouldn't breed that happen to be the ones that breed the most.  Like my sister for instance.  She's a sucky mother, which is ironic because she has three kids.  They are always sick, aren't fully potty trained and were pretty much raised by the t.v.  Why deal with the kids when you can just pop in some Disney?  Disney is crack for kids by the way.  The kids can't read for shit, but they WILL recite  The Emperor's New Groove  to you word for word.  Then those kids grow up to be retards like their parents.  And the cycle continues.  It isn't their fault.  But it's not mine either and I'm paying for it.  We all are.  The population is exploding as it is, we don't need more useless human beings around taking up our precious oxygen.  The philosophy on having children should be comparative to that of obtaining a drivers license; it's not a right, it's a priveledge.    Not too shabby of an idea, eh?  Competency tests would be required prior to engaging in procreation.  Those who pass can freely have children and those who don't can have, for instance...a gold fish perhaps.  They would be free to retake the competency test and their progress on caring for a gold fish would be observed by the people from social services.  Then if they improve they can upgrade to a mammal.  And so on and so forth.  That would make the potential creators of pathetic human beings think twice about, well, creating pathetic human beings.  That or just sterilize everyone.  Whatever's easier.
