That's what I hope to give to you forever.  i bought that soundtrack today. it went against everything i believe in...like that music should be free, and that soundtracks are stupid, no matter how good they are. but i had "i'll be seeing you" stuck in my head, and i wanted to listen to it, i  had  to listen to it...so i bought it, and then listened to it, and then proceded to watch shindler's list at barrett's house. it is not smart to start a 3-hour movie at 11:45. great movie. amazing movie. it deserved best picture.   i've never bought a cd before. my parents always bought them for me, or i got them as presents. so this was a big deal. i don't think anyone else there understands that. but i got 285 dollars today, and i could afford to buy a 13-dollar cd. and tay's dinner. and i still have more that enough for my plane tickets to New York!!!  it's a great cd though. i don't regret buying it.   anyway, i just remebered something really cool i was gonna say. then i forgot it.   OH!!  i'm watching a chorus line. it's on tv right....wait for it....NOW (commercials...pffft. i dunno why i'm watching it on tv. i have it on dvd). it's brilliant. you know why it's brilliant? because it shows  life.   not like other movies show life though...it's very honest with itself, with its industry.  but that wasn't the cool thing. i can't remeber it anymore. damn. boy meets world time!!!
