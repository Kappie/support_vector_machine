My how the time flies. I better get crackin on the studying, I HAVE to do well on them. I've become such a stereotypical junior. College is really starting to pound on my back. College used to seem so far away, but man just a year a half away. I'm not sure whether to be excited or terrified. Well for now, just one more chapter of The Great Gatsby to go...
