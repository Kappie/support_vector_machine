But do you ever feel that piece by piece, someone else is taking  your  life and making it their own. I mean, those little piece of your personality that make you who you are, are being used by someone else. Like they use your example, but they don't even acknowledge you ever. In fact, they may very well completely dislike you, but they mimic certain traits about you. Sure, seemingly childish jealous, true? Perhaps, but if someone were to take your unique character and make it their own...wouldn't you find that a bit upsetting? Proof that individuality is a game of trying to figure out who the  true  individual is. In most cases, it's usually not who you think. The one who flaunts their "individuality" is usually the one who truly lacks it.  A few thoughts to ponder. Farewell crazies.
