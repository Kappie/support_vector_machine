I suppose I really ought to do more homework before jumping right into this, but my manic lil self can't pay attention that long.  I will apologize once, up front, for the following:  excessive use of exclamation points, emoticons (those smiley face thingies), really long run-on sentences with way too many commas,  any other little writing flaws that bug you.  There, now I'm covered!!!  :) :) :)  Hahahahaha...    So, here I am, blogging my little heart out.  Woohoo!  So now what?      Let me wallow for a moment in the coolness of the Raleigh dwelling I'm hoping to move into in the next month.  Huge pool, huge fitness center, lovely little bushes and trees.  And let's not forget, it's right handy to some PRIME shopping territory!  Hoo-boy, I may end up broke, but me  my house are gonna look fab-u-lous!  Now to cross the fingers and hope I get in.      There is something so hopeful about moving to a new place.  Ah yes, leaving all the clutter and bad habits and neighbors who have sex loudly at 3:00am (on one side) or stand outside talking loudly on their cell phones late at night in a foreign language (other side).  Yessiree, when I move to the new place, I will leave all my clutter and mess behind.  I won't even put it in a box to be moved.  Due to my newfound organizational skills and heartless decluttering, Thenewplace will be a pristine haven of order...maybe even slightly minimalist!      I will not be a hermit or too shy to meet the neighbors, because in Thenewplace my neighbors will all be super-cool.  I'll host wine-tastings, martini parties, Superbowl parties, and a Kentucky Derby bash (I'll even learn to make mint juleps, handy lil hostess that I am).  I may even make a great friend in the neighborhood, and he or she will come over Saturday nights for dinner.  We'll listen to "Prairie Home Companion" and "This American Life", laugh our butts off, and drink wine while we cook.    And at Thenewplace, the walls will not remain mostly bare for months on end.  I will finally get all the quirky "art" I've amassed properly matted and framed for display.  I'll even go on ebay and get some of that groovy original art I've been eyeing.  Ah yes, Thenewplace will not only be sleekly neat and divinely organized, it will also be a showcase for my fabulous eclectic style.  People will enter and be struck by my clever, artistic, pleasing, and unique sensibilities.  I may even be referred as a designer.  Cottage industry in the making?  Why not!   While I'm at it, I think the changes will keep on coming.  Why, simply being in a space so terrific, I'll be literally INSPIRED to floss daily, remove eye makeup daily, and use that really expensive face cream each night before retiring.  Ah yes, I'll also practice some soothing yoga stretches each night.  And how can one ever let a single dish clutter the sink when living so right?      That's right, all my idiosyncracies will be magically cured by Thenewplace.  You can't deny, there is such a great feeling of pulling up stakes  making a fresh start.  Moving gives me more hope, more cause for resolution, than the dawn of a New Year (which, let's face it, largely consists of sleeping off the champagne and then stumbling into the nearest diner for a great combo of carbs, fat, and caffeine...yummm).    Blissful sleepy time about to commence.  The question... to preview, save as draft, or publish?  Aw heck, let this be your first lesson in Rebecca.  I'm not a huge fan of previewing, or drafting.  I like to just throw a thing out, with a big flourish  happy "Ta-Da!"  The result is much more fun that way.  The only thing I may tweak are unintentional spelling errors, if I catch 'em later.  Course, I don't even know if I can do that, as I didn't read the directions for this thing.  Oops.  Nighty-night!  :)
