I never thought i'd return to blog here because i've been so busy. i've been involved in all kinds of stuff, this makes my last year in ctss so memorable and fufilling! it's like as though i've really done part as a clementeen. i'm really proud of that, i wish that everyone else will make full use of their years spent there. it's not very long period, neither is it very short!  The class and i will be washing cars on this coming friday for the school fund-raising project and i'm exhilarated! the funds will be used to assist the needy pupils, who genuinely need the help of each and everyone of us. please donate generously during the fund raising fair on friday! the proceeds would also go to our graduation ceremony.  Alrighty, that's all for now! take care ya all!
