But the whole meeting was a little weird. I don't think Liz and Jessica get each other (I know Liz'll read this, but I'm sure she's aware). Liz was in a weird mood that I don't quite get. It's always so weird to me how I can really like two people, and then they have no means for connection. It's like my sisters. Alex and Catherine are such interesting people, and I have an easy time talking to both of them. But they have nothing to talk about. They don't even fight, they just don't understand each other at all, and don't really care to try. It kind of upsets me that I'm the sister they both get along with best. It secretly strokes my ego, I admit, but I so rarely don't get along with people, it just confuses me when people can't just get over it and try to empathize more. I dunno, I probably try to hard too make people feel good, I always look people in the eye, and try to really listen when people talk to me. It just seems like the way to interact with people. It's not even so much as wanting people to like me, it's me wanting people to like themselves. Maybe I'm too supportive, but I try so hard to buoy the self-esteem of my friends. Maybe that's Jerm rubbing off on me, but I like it, and I like giving--as long as it doesn't take away from my happiness. It can just be exasperating sometimes.  Oh, sidebar: for my list Melissa, I remembered: nice(ish) lotion and face care, pens and notebooks, wrapping paper and bows... that's what I can think of now, but I'll keep you posted if I notice any new trends. ;)
