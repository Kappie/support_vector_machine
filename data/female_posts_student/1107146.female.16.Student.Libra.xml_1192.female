My mom just cited an article that said that "kids who spend more that 4 hours a week on a computer have lower grades and are more likely to get addicted to 'IT'"  my mom spends more than 50 hours a week on the computer, not working, but playing mindless games.  What's the difference? Why is her spending more hours on the computer than i do at school not as bad as me getting on the computer just long enough to check my E-mail and type this up.  I do this 7 times a week.  Does that mean im addicted?  I spend maybe 7 hours a week on the computer and 7 hours a day at school.  Where do my priorities lie?  She spends 50 hours a week on this very computer im sitting at right now playing mindless games such as Destruct-o-match.  I spend 7 hours comunicating.  Hold on a second, does this seem just a little bit hypocritical?  O wait, I forgot, no one is grading her on anything.  Let's hypothesize what her grade would be like if she was being graded right now...she would be in the 65-68 range, and she complains about me getting a 91???  Additionally time how long you spend on the computer just for the purposes of communication (E-mail, this, etc.).  You probably will be over 4 hours for the week.  That means that the second part of the study cited above is useless.  The only thing it says is that if you have a computer, you are more likely to get "addicted" to it. Sorry for my little rant, but I had to get that out
