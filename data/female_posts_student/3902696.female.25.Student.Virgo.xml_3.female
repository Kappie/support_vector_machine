It is no longerwho I am. ---------------------------------------------------------------   Transitional stages change what’s within,  Memories linger, reminiscence of sin.  Clinging on to God, a fantasy of truth,  Asking Him to change me, hoping to be renewed.    Hearing doubts, poking like pins  But I am not the strength, the strength is in Him.  How I long to be different, how I long to be changed,  But old sin and its memories wrap me in chains.    I seek Him, I seek Him, how I feel everyone doubts me,  I know He must love me, but how I feel nothing.  Why can’t I believe the promises He has given?  That He sees me as pure, He sees me as forgiven.    I listen, I listen but silence I hear,  For a strong vivid voice, rumbling low and clear.  “Burdens no more, you don’t have to fear,  Life will not be empty, trust that I care”.    Promises I’ve been taught are never to be trusted,  My passage way for trust is old, brown and rusted.  I must let go, I must let go  I need help from Him, I need to be showed.    He needs to heal me, He needs me to trust Him  But I don’t know how, and where do I begin?  All I know to do is to cry out with desire,  To be different, to be helped, He’ll answer immediately prior.    I pray, I pray  “God show me today,  Your divine righteous reality  How you release the enslaved.  Make Yourself real, make me believe,  Give me faith and set me free”.    Your entire entity exists above comprehension,  How it’s hard for me to trust someone that lives in all dimensions.  Don’t let me go, don’t let me move an inch,  For living my way is worse than a tight clench.      I fear, I fear  Why am I this way?  It keeps me from growing  It makes me delayed.    Sometimes I love You, sometimes I don’t  How humanly love is such a joke.  God make me consistent, God make me strong  You are the ever constant I have always longed.    I’m trusting, I’m trusting  I’m giving You my all,  How I’m walking on nothing  Please don’t let me fall.    I want to be different, exceeding all things  I want to be the person You chose me to be.  Show me what’s wrong that prevents this from being true,  Sculpt me, wash me do what You must do.      I will trust You, I will trust You  I’m going to do as You say  I don’t care how I feel,  I’m doing it Your way.      Written on: December 22, 1998
