Well, I would just like to thank a friend of mine for giving me a lift down there when I really needed it. I met Abby near Best Buy at around Midnight, and we walked around down there talking until I had to leave at around 3:30, It was good to see her again, she has changed a lot. Not only physically but also mentally. She said I have changed a lot too, but I don't really see it. Anyway, I am finally taller than her. When we were friends a while ago she had about an inch on me and she would always bring it up. Now I am much taller so, I guess I win in that aspect. Luckily Abby did not inherit any of Jackie's bad personality traits, instead she has whole other set of them. One thing I did notice though is she dresses a little more modest then her big sister. Last night she wore and Independent sweatshirt and some baggy cargo pants. Something Jackie wouldn't be caught dead wearing. The reason she says is she doesn't need to flaunt the Emmon's family curse to get what she wants. She is right too, Abby is a very opinionated person, who sounds sort of like a feminist.  On another note, Jackie says she is leaving early so she will never see me again. This in turn would force Abby back to Pennsylvania. Good thing that is not the case, because I am still going to spend time with Abby next week, because she is going to stay for another week. She will end up getting a ride back to Pennsylvania from her cousin who just got up here. So I guess Jackie's little plan isn't going to work and she is just going to deal with the fact that Abby and I are good friends again.
