I usually don't even make any New Year's resolutions actually but this year's starting out differently. It's going to be different. I'm going to make it that way.    I don't think I want to write most of them in here because most of them are really personal but one of my big ones is to stop swearing. :) Again....haha. I did it for a year and a half. I think I can do it again. :)   Kelly's was a lot of fun. :) I brought in the New Year with people I really care about and that's all that matters. In all honesty, I'm glad I didn't go to a big party. I just wanted to spend time with people I cared about.   This year's going to be different. I don't know how but it is.
