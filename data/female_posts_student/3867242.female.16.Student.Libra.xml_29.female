I am wuss when it comes to amusement park rides, but I rode a few. I hated "The Exterminator". I did cry like a baby..the first time I've cried since I watched the last show of "Friends"! I liked the water rides even though I was wet for like 2 hours and my hair was doing something funky.  Today for the first time I tried deep fried Oreos. They dip Oreos in funnel cake batter and fry them. They are so good!! Daylin spray sugar all over my cousin Kenny..haha! Anyways, it was fun and there were some memorable moments especially on the way home. Everyone in the car not only made me listen to Blink 182 (gah! I only like a few of there songs.) but they made me listen to techno...AHHHHH!!!!!!! We had to listen to Eifel 65's "Blue (Da be Da..or whatever) like three times. Ashley had her hair all 80s like with the side ponytail. The dance routine Kyle and Kenny did to stupid Eifel 65. My mom rocking out to Rod Stewart...so many more I can't think right now and most of the funny ones will take too much space for this blog. All I can say now is that it was blast...and the next time we go..I'm getting revenge by having everyone listen to John Mayer even though they hate him. (Which is   crazy!  John Mayer is best singer/guitar player/writer of my generation! 12 days till' I see him and Maroon 5! YEAH!) So yeah...I'm heading to bed now..I'm flipping tired! Night!
