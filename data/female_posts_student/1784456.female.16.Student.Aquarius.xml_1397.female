So when it says the highest, it's probably higher! *if that makes sense... go get yourself checked out* Aaargh it's so hot here! 24!! And yes... it's a beautiful day and I'm doing ENGLISH COURSEWORKK!!! AAARGHHHH!!! Eugh... I feel like my brains melted inside my head... (I had a brain?!?!?!!) Yeesh does get a bit tiring though... 5 pages on size 10! *save me!* Oh don't worry, still got Spanish, Maths and Chem and Hist homework to go! Actually... that's a lot... and only today and Sunday to do it! Bisieee!
