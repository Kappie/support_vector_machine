Who would have ever thought they would win?  The unthinkable and the unimaginable always happens in life don't you think? I mean which person in 100A.D. would have thought that it would be possible for people to travel around the world so easily? For that matter, who at that time would have even thought the Earth was actually spherical?!?!  Lets take 2 years ago for example. I never thought I would take up shooting as my hobby. It never even occurred to me once that I would end up in NJC!  Its funny how life has so many twists and turns. Nothing is ever predictable. Its impossible for me to be 100% sure that I will do something tomorrow until that exact time comes. Call me disorganised or unsure about myself if you want but I believe its the same for everyone- not only me.
