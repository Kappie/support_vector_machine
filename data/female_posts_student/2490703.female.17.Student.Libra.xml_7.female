I'm not the sweet child that I once was. I'm going to miss the security that high school brings and all the friends that I'm never going to see again. It hurts so bad just to think about it like that. Oh, the horrible crushes that I've had on younger kids, ones that will never be made known. Regrets, If that's one of the only things that I ever got out of Mrs. Fraziers class, I have learned that living with regrets isn't any fun. Live life to the fullest and set forth goals that you want to achieve and achieve them. I wrote an essay on that today. I'm going to miss Mrs. Frazier's class, Honors English was hard, but the year FLEW by so quickly. It seems like it's going slow, but then you're done. It seems like yesterday I was a freshman looking forward to starting high school and making new friends. I'm sure College will be fun, but the reminiscing will never end. It seems like yesterday that you and I were close together and I also remember the day you left for Ohio. I cried so hard, I knew that I was going to miss you so much, and I still do. I about lost it when they played our class song over the PA and you walk out into the commons and there are a bunch of people crying...Guys and girls that you have known your whole life pretty much and they are gone. It's just incredible. I taped a little bit of the madness and the tears. The last day of high school is a crazy time because people tell others how they really feel. It's an emotional day. It's a day I will never forget. I counted down the hours, but when it was all over, I cried my eyes out. Cleaning out my locker I couldn't believe it, you know when you know things are going to change and you get that feeling of hurt like you don't want to let go, but when you do, you know it will be for the best. I felt that way today as I opened my locker for the last time. I can't wait for graduation.   The Missionaries came over today but my parents weren't home. I talked to them for a while and they were really fun. The new one that we have is really cute, I shouldn't say that, but he is. I'm such a dork. He told me he hoped to see me at church, Maybe they know something. Like I'm a bad kid now. I'm trying to be the "perfect" kid again, but it's really hard to give up those bad habits. I'm sure with a little bit of effort, I will.  OMG! Yesterday the scarcity thing happened. I was driving home and My tire exploded. The car tiped a little but I just thought it was flat so I coasted to the stop sign to see how bad the damage was. I got out and I was so scared. I don't have a cell phone right now, so I'm stranded in the middle of nowhere with no phone and no where to go. I prayed that someone would help me and a man stopped and asked if I needed a phone. I started crying. I called home and no one answered. So I called Amanda Pringle because she was like 5 minutes away. I was so scared I cried when I heard her voice. She drove me home and my mom and our neighbor came and fixed the tire. I was seriously so scared. Luckily all went well and I didn't die. But it was still scary. But I have to go, I have some work to do for the open house! I love you like a sister!                       Peace and Love,                          Melissa
