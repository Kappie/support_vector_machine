The party is now 6:00-10:00.  PM, obviously.  And um, yeah, I think everything else on the invitiation was right.  Yall all know how to get here, even Josh, so that shouldn't be an issue.  Yes, it's this Saturday.  Remember to bring a snack, otherwise there will be nothing to eat.  Not chex mix, though.  I despise chex mix, and it is not allowed in my house.  Blech.  Puppy chow is ok, though.
