I just hit this mood and well you know.. Or maybe................You don't. Do you? OH YOU DON'T!?!?!? WOW! Well I guess I could explain or maybe not. Although there would be no harm in it. Or would there? NO? YOU DON'T THINK SO? Well I guess..But no.. I mean I could.. But no...I cant ...Well I can.. But mentally there is this little spot in my head that holds me back from talking and telling anything I feel for the fear that I will say something that I will regret later or hurt someone's feelings or embarrass myself or let anyone get a little bit closer. Although you can. Can What you ask. Get closer. I don't open my heart willingly to anyone BUT if you act interested, you could probably dig it out of me. What? How long will it take? Oh WELL it depends on my mood, my anger, my irritability. Huh! You probably think IM crazy. What? You don't? WHY, everyone else does. Wait are you leaving? Yes? But why? But you said you didn't think I was crazy..................................What changed? Oh....I See......Nothing changed......You thought I was crazy all along.
