I really need to move or something because I really do not feel that it is healthy that I cannot even tolerate the presence of a good majority of my class. Hearing their voices whining or whatever day in and day out has really taken a huge toll on me. I really have never been more stressed than I am today.   Elections are over anyways, and the results are just how they should be:  Billy K - President  David N - Vice President  Shannon R - Treasurer (meh...) Cristina Z - Secretary  Come to find out there is a public relations position that has been added to the grades below me. Go figure! The one thing that I would actually run for!  ::grumbles::   None of my classes were bad, minus my classmates being present. It was one of those days where I just did not want to speak to any of them, but go figure I ended up talking briefly to Bill...who I really did not want to...,Rils, Shannon, Wild Bill, and Sjodin. Oh well. I suck at that "cold shoulder" thing.   My mind was definitely wondering worse than normal today. My largest amount of focus was in English this morning where I got to be Murderer #1 in MacBeth. Appropriate for my mood anyways...JUST KIDDING.   Got home to see that my stepmom and sister-in-law were home which really added to everything because the whole OCD thing so I needed a loooong walk. So I have walked to the library. Now that I have read what I wished to read, I feel that I may venture further. Maybe I will head out to East Windsor. I am trying to pick a destination since I just want to be far away but I cannot really think of anything. And now I am just rambling. Sorry.   If only time would go faster.   I think I am off to read  Sense and Sensibility  for a while. Once I get bored with that I will probably stop somewhere and eat dinner...maybe...before I figure out a way home from how far away I am. Canal...now there is an idea!  Have a good evening!  -J9
