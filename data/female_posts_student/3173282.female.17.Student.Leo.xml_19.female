Very delicious. 500 ketchup packets gathered by me and justin as usual. Scattered them accross white street, like usual BK business. Every time it never ceases to make me laugh, those packets popping is the most wonderful sound to my ears. Well anyway, that was fun but i suppose some lady saw this happen and followed us back to the school. Told mr. horton that I did it. Me and only me. Well i was rudely interrupted from the disco video in my guitar class, simply to be informed that i could no longer eat open lunch for the rest of the year. THATS FIIIINE! And also, if the lady takes it to the cops i could get a $300 fine for littering. Also FINE. So here i am all pissed of and getting in trouble never ceases for the day. Then i realize i have so much shit to do for english, and i have choir practice from 6-9. Incredible evening. And of course all throughout the day, because i'm weak i just break into tears cuz i cant handle shit happening all at once and maybe i miss someone? yeah. Well it's sleepy time i guess. Later bro's and ho's. I love you all....
