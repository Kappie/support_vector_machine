I ran into many walls, a drinking fountain, about 12 ppl, and I was tackled many many times. I have a bruise on my knee and one on my hip, and I got a bloody nose from running into a wall full speed,yeah I uh, took a corner to soon...and when we were playing i got tired from running the whole time so I layed down and my brother came running full speed towards me and kicked me in the head...I was pretty dizzy after that. And the whole game, my friend paco (his real name is phillip but we call him paco cause he's mexican)thought it was fun to hide  and then scare the crap outta me when I walked past him...yeah but I am sore all over. But it was great fun. I'm going on a youth trip this monday-friday and we're going to play it again. only it'll be in a building no one is familiar with...I can't wait I want a black eye or something REALLY visible, then I can tell people i got in a fight...or something...now if you'll excuse me i have to go beat my brother in Halo.
