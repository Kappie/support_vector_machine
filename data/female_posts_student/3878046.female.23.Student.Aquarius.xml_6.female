	 
      we sat there like little kids,
our legs dangling through the railings high above,
and the silence was rich and beautiful,
but full of clarity.
no need for words or movement,
we were there.
our minds aware of one another,
but free to follow their own journey.
i could bare my soul to you
strong, soft, silent and observant,
thinking a million things at once,
but still so slow.
