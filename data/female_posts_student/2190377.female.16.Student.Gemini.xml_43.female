I'm really pleased with myself though, because slave driver Coach P is pleased with me and maria (s. yes. another. i know too many marias). Yeshyeshyesh.  Yesterday we ate a milkbone.  :)   We found it sitting in the track lobby.  That pretty much summarizes my mental state right now lol.  Endorphins are good.  I have lots of story but don't feel particularly inclined to tell them :P  There is one at the back of my mind, and I can't think of it.  That angers me.  Some silly kid making a really amusing slip-up.  Speaking of slip-ups I think I'm going deaf.  So today after track Megan DeBettencourt told me she liked my outfit or something. Somehow I heard, "What'd you guys do today?"  so I said, "hurdles." haaaaaaah  "I like your outfit today." "Hurdles." wow.  thats it.  wussy i know just go look at the xanga theres loads more than youd ever want to know about me in it.  since i know you stalk me
