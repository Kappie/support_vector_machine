I mean, have you SEEN the Real World Paris? They get kicked out of a resturant for yelling and got all pissy over it. Um, hello folks... it was rightfully so.   I want to go to Oxford with Marissa when we graduate so we can get the hell outta here while at the same time finding our rich, hot, British husbands that also happen to be some obscure Lord or Duke of 'such-and-such'.   Altough Irish guys are equally appealing...and have much more fun. Drinking, singing...it all goes hand and hand to the blarney of heart.  Its hilarous when Marissa tells stories of her family when they get drunk and go to Docker's (....hey! Its our grandma's birthday too!....), because they are mostly Irish.   Samething with my dad's friend Joe Kelly. He came over one night after "drinking ONLY water" (uummm...surrrre....) at that new chicken wing place out by the mall. He preceded to go on and on about how fanatastic the TVs above the urinals are there...and how the war in Iraq could have been prevented if this type of electronic installment was present in ALL urinals around the globe.   Gotta love that family...Bonnie, Megan, Erin and Sean (how Irish can ya get?)  Half my family is Irish, but we don't have any fun stories to tell. That side is kinda quiet when it comes to our ancestry.   I think it has something to do with the fact that they are from NYC and Jersey...and might have been involved in some secret, undercover Irish mafia.   Actually no, the Irish would be no good at mafia work. They'd all get too lazy  to go kill someone and just take him out for a drink instead!
