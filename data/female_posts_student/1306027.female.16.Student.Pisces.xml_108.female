I mean, I just.. I don't fit anywhere in this stupid world. I don't belong in (insert state here). I don't fit with the people, I don't fit with the surroundings. I just, want to live somewhere else. But, I know that wouldn't help cause people are basically the same everywhere. Maybe I could live in a place where people haven't been brainwashed yet. Like some island where all the natives speak a different language and they haven't even heard of the words "cell phone" and "car" and.. "stupid jerk".  It would be awesome.  But then I would miss all of the people that I love here in the states. Which, is a list of about 10. Some of who, I probably couldn't live without. Like, for example, Arturo. Who I love completely and trust more than anyone else I know at the moment. Scary, yes I know. He's just too awesome to not like that way. He probably thinks I'm a wimp and a complete loon.. but..yeah. Props to him for putting up with me on the phone last night.  You see, this whole ordeal came up with this guy (let's call him Jerk), and he put me in a situation that became slightly more uncomfortable than I could deal with. I'm not a confrontational person. I would rather be a fly on the wall than to actually have to deal with someone. That's because I would most likely kill them if I actually got involved. I have a very short temper. Anyways, this Jerk was really starting to piss me off, and as I was leaving I told my mom who it was. She went back inside and told him what she thought of him and I just.. freaked out. I don't think my mom understands how that's going to come down on me. I mean, I don't hate my mom or anything for saying something, but still.. I can just see what is going to come for that. So, I was really upset last night.  I got home and got on the computer so I could email Tim.. and Arturo was on so he imed me and asked what was up. I told him I wasn't in the greatest mental condition and he wanted to know why (naturally..). I told him I didn't really want to explain it online and told him that I was going to cry myself to sleep. I think Arturo must have a soft spot for sad people cause he was like "Wanna talk??". And.. I knew he had to go to bed cause of his art institute thingy so I told him if he was willing to put up with my choking up and stuff then I would call. Lol. I think he didn't really want to talk to me just then but he did anyways. Thanks Arturo. That was awesome of you.  He made me feel better last night.. which was something I needed so that I could fall asleep. Lol, he said- "Who brought the happy? I brought the happy! That's right."  *sigh*  I still need a hug though.  And that's all I have to say for today.
