This tale starts with one of my very good friends who first started to call me "NUT" (fondly of cause). That nickname just caught on so easily and tagged along with me ever since.   Weird as it may sound, I grew to associate myself with nuts. If a caricature myself is ever drawn I can't imagine it without having a nut somewhere in it. Most people associate nuts with being foolish, silly or crazy (think of the term nutcase for example) but I think of it differently.  A nut has a hard and rough shell outside it but the inside is smooth and yummy. Likewise, I'm a very frank person. Some things that I say hurt people at times(just like the shell) but I mean good (just like the nut inside). hahah...I'm getting nutty ( never thought I would come up with such an analogy).  Well on the lighter side, I just love eating nuts! hahaha Yummy!  That's my nutty nut story for you!
