We went to the sand dunes and we played a game  It started off as Granny went to the shop, but ended up as Annie went to the market...  And bought a  Apple Banana Carrot Duck Elephant Fish Gertrude House Insect Jess Kiss Lemon Monkey Stripper Notorious Elf Orang Utan Pogo Stick Queer leprechaun Rancid Waffle Sex Toy Tampon Umbrella (at first he said Rupert the bear...LMAO!) Violin Willy X Files Yellow Boat Zimbabwe Man  Great fun!!! Well we started to walk back, when we attacked by Dean Cowling, I thought I was going to be hit, seeing as the girls were shouting: Get off my boyfriend you little slags  Then Dean was holding me, and wouldn't let go of me, until the girls came round the corner, but it ended up as a friendly chat...which was good!  Went to my room, all my sisters followed and we stayed up telling jokes...  Dunno the plan for today... Bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx   It is now half eleven at night   Well the afternoon was pretty cool, Nips came over, then we decided to dream, so we went down St Petroc's and was just full on dreamt, it was hilarious, I've made up a completely new game called "19 Seconds", if I oculd remember what the rules were, I'd tell you, but I don't so you know!  My MoMmI was being ever so rude towards Tabby Baby, about a lift going home,but I think everyone is forgiven now! Not much else to say, I had a bath, cuz I'm hardcore :P Well better be going Bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
