I have my Algebra SOL Monday. I'm really nervous about that one too. I know I passed my Biology SOL. Lol. Everytime I say I know I passed something, I end up failing it. Oh well. What can ya do? Nothing. Ha. Anyways, I'm gonna get my second hole tomorrow.(ear piercing for the not so bright ones lol) Then I'm gonna get a third hole in one ear. Cute eh?   I'm in Behind The Wheel now. Where you drive a car around with an instructor. Yea. I have to take it for three weeks! And today, I wanted to slit his throat. I'm not very good at parallel parking, because I don't do it that often, and he's fucking picky about it. Just cuz it wasn't perfectly straight, he had me do it over and over again and he kept pointing out all my mistakes. I'm determined to prove to this asshole that I can parallel park better then his grandma can chew on raw carrots. Oooh he makes me so angry.  I'm having a rough time. It's that time of the month, and I swear I'll forever hate it. It makes me feel so blah. Like today, I was all pissy at my parents, and I got mad and yelled at my mom while she was taking me to work. I wanted to break down and cry because I was so sorry that I had done that to her. I love her so much. I seriously really do and I hate when I get like this. I started to cry, but she didn't notice. And then she asked me how my day went, and all I could say, was "It was blah." I'm such a fucking lame ass daughter. I swear I am. I'm getting upset now just thinking about what I said to her.  "I thought we were just hangin out|So why'd you kiss me on the mouth?"  Much love
