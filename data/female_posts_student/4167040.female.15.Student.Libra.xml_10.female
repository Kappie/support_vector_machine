My Xanga is a little messed up right now but I'll keep writing in that too because that has like records of everything I have gone through. Jeff is over right now and he's sad because he doesn't have a dog...and the only dog he owns...he shot with a tranquilizer gun. Anyway...I'm all happy now. Michael finally called me...and he wasn't suppose to, but he did anyway...lol, well that's Mike for you all. Jeff and I have just messed around the whole time. We even drew in our driveway with chalk! It was lots of fun, people thought we were retarded though...lol. I've also tipped my computer chair over twice so far...lol. Well, I guess that's all for tonight. Luv yall.
