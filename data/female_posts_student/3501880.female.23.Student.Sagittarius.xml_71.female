Apparently, I haven't missed much either. American Idol is over. No more Apprentice. Hell, there isn't even Friends as a last choice option.  Last night, I finally turned on the television and half-watched episodes of  For Love or Money  and  Who Wants to Marry My Dad? . I wish I hadn't.  During  For Love or Money , the only slightly interesting thing about that show is how incredibly convoluted and scripted it has become. The cast even SOUNDS like they are reading off a script. There wasn't an ounce of believability behind those "shocked" and "surprised" faces when the twist was revealed.    Marry My Dad  seemed less scripted, but it appeared to me that the cast must be on high doses of psycho-medication in order to believe they were actually feeling those emotions. How disturbing has reality television become when they put contestants into wedding dresses and have them write "marriage vows" to some man they met two days ago.  My friends, the apocalypse is near.
