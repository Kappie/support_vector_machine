Look at me, writing this blog, basically to myself -- with the vain hope of finding someone online who actually knows what I'm talking about.   You see, you're the expert. I actually have a visa that states I am a foreign expert if you need further proof. But apart from that, I  am  the expert -- in a really small isolated field of my own making. Is there anyone else, in the entire world, looking at community development, mass tourism and national parks in China. No. Otherwise my research would not be as exciting and new as it is. Yet, in saying that, who really cares what I'm researching except for me?   Writing a thesis serves to create a small little world of relevant theory and practice that I alone reside in fully and understand. Any future person reading my thesis is doing so for the purpose of finding a few things in it that contribute to  their small little world of research which may involve one of the same factors that mine involves. For fifty or sixty hours a week, I am lost in the 'thoughts of Kai Li' which reflect my own personal conjunction of education, experience, geography and history in a certain point of time. Not even my husband has a clue what I'm doing. I'm not even sure that my supervisor does. She's just waiting for the finished product.  And then the culture shock/depression on returning from the field. Nobody in New Zealand, in fact, no Westerner has ever lived as I lived in Panyazhai. No one knows my friends there. Most people don't even know of their existence. I think it's like when someone close to you dies that none of your friends know, there is no outlet for joint reflection and discussion -- they cease to exist without you remembering them. That's how I feel about my community of friends in Jiuzhaigou. I miss them, but who cares? I can't even contact them really. I am intensely interested in their fate, but who cares? I just become another eccentric academic who can't stop talking about their research. Do we present papers because we really think our research is meaningful and interesting to others? No, because we want to talk about ourselves, to justify our pitiful existence.   Incidently, I am going to present a seminar on my research. And two conference papers this year. So I'll finally have my 15 minutes (or hour) of fame. Some of my research experiences are also outlined on  urlLink www.mytripjournal.com/jiuzhaigoufieldwork  , which has all my emails and slices of lifes that I had the urge to splurt out while I was away (those that weren't mysteriously eaten up by random computers at dodgey internet cafes...)
