I'm not going to make the rules on this one, since this blog doesn't just belong to me.  Also, here is some information:  Tag-Board.com username thing: SMKids Password: I will tell you each personally.  I also set up an email account at Yahoo.com to use as the universal SM Kids blog email address (if you have to sign up for something, like Tag-Boards, this is the email you sign up with if it is going on this blog). The email address is: SMHSKids@yahoo.com (SMKids was taken...) Password: Same as above.  Mmmyep.
