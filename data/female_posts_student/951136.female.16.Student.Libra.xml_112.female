Dont get me wrong. i'm not all like pessimistic; Dont start anything b.c. it'll never last!! not at all. b.c. if i had a boyfriend right now, i'd go to him right now. b/c my day was shite. i'd just want him to be there to reassure me that i still hold something good in my life -not wholesome- good :} but i dont! hey, would ya look at that. c'est la vie.  i dont have a headache. but this constant droning at the back of my head. everything that bothers me is just sitting there. reminding me, every second of everyday. I dont know what it is though. im fine with going to school. no problems- worries maybe. no one is especially on my back. nothing is a horror. its just everything combined is scratching away at me. a little here. some more there. and i can ignore it. go about everything fine. i'm happy, sure. but its the same little scratches on the same places.  i'm not complaining that i have no friends, life sucks. b.c. i get that from alot of ppl, myself. its annoying. but i'm stuck.  i want it to be better. but what can i fix... it could be so much worse so thank god its not. but then i'd have a drive to improve if it was worse. to excell to keep what i had if it was better. but its neither. i do wish it was the summer with all my heart. even better. i wish i was 19. and it was the summer. back in town. and i ran into some old friends from school at the grocery store or something. yes. that is my deep dark wish in life.   Here's to the good life or so they say  On the other side of a coin There's a face there's a memory somewhere that I can't erase And there's a place that I find someday But sometimes I feel like it's slippin' away Sometimes I feel like something is gone here Something is wrong here, I don't belong here Sometimes I feel like a stranger in town  And I've lost what I found, it'll all turn around In a little while I'll be thinkin' about you In a little while I'll still be here without you You never gave me a reason to doubt you In a little while I'll be thinkin' about you baby
