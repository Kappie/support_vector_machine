I was so tired last night after shopping with my mom for the day. It was awesome. I got to go to Woodfield so, I got to go to    Forever XXI   and   HM .  I was excited. :) I got lots of stuff too. I got a dress....like a regular dress that I'll ahve to wear sometime. I like it a lot even though it is a dress.    Today, I woke up late for summer school and like, ran out the door. I didn't even get to shower. I HATE that. I hate waking up and not being able to take a shower. Ms. St. Vincent brought in her dogs so, it was a party. Lots of fun. My paper was acceptable so, I don't have to write it again. I'm glad she graded them like that because if she hadn't, that'd definitely be a D paper. Heh...oh well. That's the hard work of 45 minutes of writing and playing Snood...ahem....     Anyway, tonight I get to see     DAVID!!!!   I'm super excited. He's one of my life long buddies. I've been friends with him for like, 16 years. We were diaper buddies along with Kelly. :) Now, if I could just get in touch with Nick, my old naptime buddy, I'd be set for friends I've had since I was born basically!     We're going bowling with Kelly.....the three diaper amigos. And then, I think a bunch of other people are coming too since this is his last night in town. Bummer. So, yeah. It should be fun times. I'm hoping Carson's there and I'll get a chance to see her too. Nikki's coming as well, so it'll be nice to hang out with her since we don't get to hang out so much anymore.    Diane and I have set a day for Six Flags. Wednesday the 28th. YaY! I'm excited. I'm happy I finally found someone who loves roller coasters as much as I do. Whoooo....     Well, I'm off. I need to get my mom's birthday present. :)
