Besides, they say that Jean-Claude is my soul mate, I can definetly live with that!  Incase your wondering, Jean-Claude is a character from the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter Series by  urlLink Laurell K. Hamilton !  Y'all should read it if you haven't already -and if you like Horror, Mystery, type novels.    ~Kristyn
