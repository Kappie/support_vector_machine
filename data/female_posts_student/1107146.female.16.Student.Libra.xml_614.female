I'm sick of telling you she doesn't hate you!! What in the fuck is it going to take to convince you otherwise? And if you're going to act like a little kid and say, "too bad it offended ya" and shit like that, don't expect me to be all nice and civil...if not anyone else, I can just feel the poison behind what you said.  No one  was  attacking you, but again, and by God as my witness, you will stop this "you hate me so i hate you" shit or I won't have anything to do with you. I mean, honestly, has she actually come out and said, "I hate you you dumb bitch,"??? I want you to give me tangible, real, solid proof that this actually happened, or I want you to drop it. I can't believe you would sink so low as to judge someone on what you  think  they said. And also...you stick a knife in my girlfriend's back and you stick a knife in mine.  It sickens me to see the rampant level of unfounded hate and immaturity flowing through this situation. Immaturity is the best word for it. You said to me the other day, "C'mon, you can't seriously side with her?" or something to that effect? I just about blew my top when I heard that, Rosie. Denying all other factors, i.e.: being my girlfriend, and trusting her beyond most everyone...that's just crossing the line.   There is NO PROOF that anyone pointed the finger at you!! Absolutely none, whatsoever! I don't care what you assume, I don't care what you've heard from Scott, I don't care what the fucking President of Finland told you, unless I can hold and feel and taste the fact that Abby actually fully loathes you, then I could see that you were founded in your opinion...I wouldn't agree with it, but I wouldn't be calling you an ass for it.  It's time to stop being so damned bigoted and so highly placed above everyone else and grow up. It hurts me more than you know when you say the things you do about Abby. It hurts to watch you lash at her because of what you THINK. IT DOESN'T ALL WORK ON INTUITION; SOMETHINGS ARE  REAL  AND  FOUNDED  AND HAVE  REAL  CAUSES.   This is all about what you don't know. So stop it before we dig this any deeper.   And all of you know: I've only attacked back because I was struck first.
