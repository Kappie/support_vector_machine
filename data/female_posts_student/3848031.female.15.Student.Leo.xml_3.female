VERY sore tired depressed dizzy and overall bored. im sore from soccer. it was horrible. the coach made me play goalie the second half because he 'needed someone experiance in net because it was raining' bah my ass. yeah so i let a goal in which pissed me off cuz me being the agressive player i am,of course i got mad. i also got kicked about 50 times...but i kicked a girl in the mouth so that helped. if i hadnt played goal we woulda had to forfit which woulda sucked ass so i had to play. halfway through the second half i was really dizzy and had to stop for a few minutes. i still kinda am. to make the game even better, there were these 2 idiots who looked like they were 11 standing behind my net the whole time saying 'way to go baby' go yellow go yellow ahh they were pissing me off so i was like 'um ref? can we get these idiots away from the net?' and everyone started laughing at them. it was great. yeah. im not sure why im depressed but its depressing being depressed. im bored because theres nothing to do. ive been listening to the song broken continuously for about an hour. i really like it. its a me song. yep. well  hmmmm i dunno what else to write but yeah whatever. c yah
