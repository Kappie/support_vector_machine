Story begins...  so... the second day back home, we had gathering for sut1 crew and users in warung ubud. yeah.. same old place! quite nice though. there, i met quite lots of guys i dun remember knowing. lots of old friends too.. brothers, ex-es. you know who i'm talking about. after dismissal, we went to sun plaza. i aaid, that place is not bad.. might be excellence.. too bad it's still kinda empty. imagine.. big spacious, but empty.. scary rite ?  most of the time.. might say all of the time i'm just hanging around next door or downstairs helping up.. or u might just say messing up. i never did all my homework, just very few of it. days were boring.  back here, it's not boring. it's tiresome. homework can't be done. it's just too much. now that i had my english lesson from british council and piano lesson every wednesday and thursday... i'm soooooooooo damn tired.  good thing monday is a holiday! i'm not planning to skip school though! oh yeah, i watch spiderman 2 yesterday. everytime i watch spiderman the movie i heard lots of inspirational speech. i love that. keep it up spidey. waiting for the 3rd. i heard it's gonna be in 2007.  just a few movie i plan to watch : mean girls, around the world in 80 days, windstruck, king author. that's all i think. hope i have enough $$.  c'ya till the next.  Yours, AngeLa
