This brought a blush to his cheeks, although he was unsure exactly why.  "It was fun. We kept throwing the girls into the deep end and they were screaming for us to stop."  His face lit up as he told of his escapades with his friends and he didn't let Joel's expression bother him in the least. He continued to relay the events of the afternoon in a bubbly tone that only a child could possess. Damien's thoughts were of innocent fun, completely impervious of the older man's unspoken intentions. After several minutes of recounting the day's events, Damien realized that he didn't know what was planned for this evening.  "What are we going to do tonight, Joel?"  Damien was excited that his parents had left him behind instead of dragging him along with them on vacation. They didn't realize how embarrassing it was for a twelve-year-old boy to hang out with his parents during such outings. Even though Joel was babysitting him while the rest of the family was away, Damien felt more independent. He still loved his parents yet he had reached that age where children begin to distance themselves from their family and spend more time with friends and role models. In this particular case, Joel was both. Even though Joel often babied him, Damien felt special since the college student genuinely wanted to spend a lot of time with him.
