And the people that bail, five minutes into the game. Ok ok ok the cons outweight the pros e.e And that's probably why I'm my little play-AoM-24/7 spree is about to end..or I'm going to make it end..  I got a little..furious..this afternoon. I was playing a rated game against a guy who used an incredibly cheap trick and rushed my village at the very beginning of the game. I barely stayed in there..I made new towncenters and lots of migdol structures (was playing as egyptian..Isis, actually)..but eventually my resources were gone and there was no point to keep on playing, since he kept killing off almost all of my people, in which I would have to rebuild in another remote location on the map..again. So I resigned. The after-battle conversation: Him: gg (good game) Me: That was not a good game. That was a cheap trick that you used at the beginning. Him: so u r a girl? Me: Don't try and hit on me because I'm really pissed off right now... Him: how old r u? Me: AGGH Me: DAMMIT  And I left in a very bad mood ^_^ Was very angry to find out that my punching bag downstairs has been taken down and that I didn't have anything to take my anger out on.   heh. And now I'm angry again. Too much testosterone in online games..bleh. There needs to be more girl gamers >  I think I'm gonna go find some stupid quizzes to put in this blog now..
