My dad had to have eye surgery and has been out of work for a month now. He can't drive either so I have been dragging him around every where but its cool. My sister had her baby on the 28th a lil baby girl named Lily Claire. She is the cutest thing in the world! Geri I think is finally rid of her cancer which is the best news ever! Nothing much besides that just getting my lifegaurding licence...I know this is really boring but once stuff happens I will make sure to tell you...I will write more later I don't feel like pouring my heart out right now!
