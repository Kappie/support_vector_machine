C'est la vie, (c'est la vie!) that's just the way it goes (that's right)!   It's a grey day in the tri-state area and its making me not want to do ANYTHING.  You know that feeling?  Where you have a lot of stuff to do, but absolutely no desire to do any of it?  Yeah, that's me.  Bleh.    Actually, I'm having one of those "I dont feel like doing anything all weekend" moments.  I think I'm going into shut-down mode.  I get like this when I feel like I have a lot on my plate.  Its like looking at a really messy house and wondering where to start, so instead of starting anything, you sit in the filth and see what's on TV...and then you watch something really dumb just to avoid doing anything.  Like maybe watching Judge Dredd or The Fabulous Life of... (back-to-back episodes, rewatching a few for the hell of it).    Actually, I have a (not so-) secret love of that show.  I love how these celebrities buy pants that are $400 but look like they cost $12.  Or Li'l Kim and her tacky ass.  Am I the only one who wonders how she has so much money to shop an' shit? I mean, does she have hit albums?  Is she even remotely talented? I dont think I've ever heard any of her shit.  School me, please, 'cause I just dont get it.
