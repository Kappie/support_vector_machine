It's going to be insanely crowded, I'm sure of it. Probably just getting to the beach will take me forever! Maybe I should just wait until next weekend and lay out by the pool instead. Yeah. I forgot this was Memorial Day Weekend until yesterday. I have to work it anyways. Back in the day I used to go to Juniper Spring with my best friend and her family. It's a 7 mile canoe run. We used to have a blast. Ahh...the good ol' days. They probably still go, but I haven't hung out with Emily in  FOREVER.  I miss her. Well I have nothing exciting to write about today. I think I'm going to just hang out by the pool and enjoy the nice weather.
