It's cause of you that I thought of updating my Blogger. lol  Men are like ~ Laxatives~  They irritate the shit out of you.  Men are like ~  Bananas ~  The older they get, the less firm they are.  Men are like ~  Vacations ~  They never seem to be long enough.  Men are like ~  Weather ~  Nothing can be done to change them.  Men are like ~  Blenders ~  You need One, but you're not quite sure why.  Men are like ~  Chocolate Bars ~  Sweet, smooth,  they usually head right for your hips.  Men are like ~  Commercials ~  You can't believe a word they say.  Men are like ~  Department Stores ~  Their clothes are always 1/2 off.  Men are like ~  Government Bonds ~  They take soooooooo long to mature.  Men are like ~  Mascara ~  They usually run at the first sign of emotion.  Men are like ~  Popcorn ~  They satisfy you, but only for a little while.  Men are like ~  Snowstorms ~  You never know when they're coming, how many inches you'll get or how long it will last.  Men are like ~  Lava Lamps ~  Fun to look at, but not very bright.  Men are like ~  Parking Spots ~  All the good ones are taken, the rest are handicapped.
