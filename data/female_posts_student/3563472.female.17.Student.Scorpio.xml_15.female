I probably will eventually, but for now, I like it being just an irrelevant blog.   Anyways.. To whomever   Have you ever seen something--something very small-- that captivated you? Something that, in fact, made you question your existence or made it more worthwhile? Something that forced a little more life into your nearly drain heart?  Not too long ago--an hour maybe---I was driving home from Mary Beth's. I had just dropped Jacko off, and I was turning off S. Iowa onto the four lanes when I noticed a biker in the lane I was in. So, like any other driver would do, I switched lanes and passed the biker. I caught a glimpse of the person on bike, and it was a man... I'm guessing he was 76 years old. His bike was packed with many bags, and it was nearing midnight. He rode with much determination.  You are probably wondering how this had any influence on my thoughts, life, etc. So, I will describe for you my thoughts.  At my ripe age, sometimes I feel my life is leveling off. It has always been my fear that in everyone's life they reach a point where growth stops and people just settle in. I guess I'm a free spirited type of girl, and I never want to reach a point  where life is a routine.   So...I guess this man is what I want to be when I'm old. I want to have determination to see/do new things. I want to be able to pack my bags on a bike and ride to wherever I want. I want to keep my free spirited soul and never live a life of routine.    I guess it's strange I can learn so much from a brief experience with a stranger. I hope someday someone will look at me through the same eyes I saw through today.
