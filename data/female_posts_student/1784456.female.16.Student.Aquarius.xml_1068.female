We should so go on the BBC website after Look Around You (when the guys are online. Stick with it, admazingly I do have a point!) and ask them where we can buy it! (Seriously needing a life) No, not really. Just a whole load of pain relievers at the moment. The computer's getting to me and I've got a bad headache. :( (...) What! I've only been on this for about two hours! (Try three) Meanie!
