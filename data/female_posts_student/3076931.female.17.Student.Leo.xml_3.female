And i know i've done it to myself. I've always constantly had people around me. And now things have changed so drasitically that it's awkward. I don't even know what to do. I really need someone. anyone. i'm not talking about boyfriends or anything like that. I just wish someone would understand. I don't know why i did what i did. Maybe it was that i just felt lost with everyone. I felt like i was getting lost. god this sounds like i'm trying terribly to sound all deep and shit but it's nothing like that. Things have changed so much. It didn't really bother me at first. I think i may have liked the change a little. But now i think things just finally caught up to me and hit me in the face.  I want to pick up the phone and call someone to talk to about everything, but then i realize that i really truly don't have anyone to call. No one would understand, and i don't really think people would really even want to hear from me and/or give me the time. I feel so out of place with "them" now. don't get me wrong, i know i've done it myself. it's just such a weird feeling. I don't know what to do with it.  and i know i can't change things and go back to normal cuz things just don't work that way.  I mean i try to focus on the positive things..all the things i have going to for me..but it's just so hard to focus on that and not let my mind wander to all the other things. things that i wish didn't bother me. I wish i could be strong. I want to be seen as a strong person, but honestly inside i feel like the weakest person out there.  I want to feel wanted. And i don't feel like i'm wanted by anyone. and it really really hurts. why have i done this? I keep asking myself the same question.   I drove by her car today in the back row of the junior lot and i saw the tennessee sticker in her front window..and i knew it was her car. I drove up by it and stopped. I got out my pen and a piece of paper, and then i chickened out. it was the pad of paper that says "from somebody pretty damn important". The one she was going to leave on a person parked in the handicap lot that we thought didn't have a handicap pass. haha. I was going to leave a note..but then i realized i didn't know where to start.  I don't know what happened.  I want to know what happened myself, believe me.   i know i've distanced myself from some people..and by doing that..i've distanced myself with other people that i didn't want to be distanced from. i guess it's just because they're all together..it's the crew. but sometimes when we would hang out on the weekends, i just felt so out of place and unwanted. i know i say that and some may not believe me..but it really did come out that way. Sometimes the things people said or did really did hurt me. and i was just sick of all the negativity and having to deal with that. i dunno. I keep trying to search for answers...but i don't think i will ever find them.   Lick -i miss you and it hurts. i dont know why. i don't even know what happened. I want to call you but i'm too scared. I don't know why. I guess i'm afraid that you have resentment and anger towards me and i'm too afraid to deal with that. I never wanted to lose you as a friend. so many things have changed. I didn't want it to be this way. I just wanted some things to change..i didn't want a totally different life. I think i'm saying this all to you because i always felt like you were the one i felt most comfortable with and that understood me. and now that i don't have that person, it feels so weird. i'm so sorry for whatever i did. I may have wanted to distance myself from other people, but i didn't want to distance myself from you. I'm sorry. i don't know what happened.  I don't even know if you'll see this.
