U see a person of the opposite sex and then sparks fly...but that's what U think, not the other person...but u think the other person thinks the same way. You live on this false hope that he is attracted to you and that's how u carry on with your life. But somehow, you can tell that he doesn't feel the same way, but denial sets in and you continue to believe that false hope...you enjoy the feeling of first love -- a little spicy and cozy, but bitter as your heart longs for him. But after a year or so, this feeling starts to subside, and u try your best to cling on to it -- after all, it's your first love and u wanna enjoy it forever...but it just fades...leaving your heart as it first entered. But sometimes, it never goes away; but u obviously notice that he doesn't feel for you...then u hurt, u cry, u try to forget, but it never leaves u alone...the feeling never goes away. Congratulations, u haf been plagued by love. And then after the feeling subsides...u get that feeling on another person again. And it's the same old cycle again and again...sighz...when will this torture ever end?  *An owner of a lonely heart is better than an owner of a broken heart.*
