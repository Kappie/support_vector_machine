The fact that I knew every song of both bands, totally made the experience even better...I can sing along the whole time!! Favorite Song that Maroon 5 played--tie between Shiver and Sunday Morning, Favorite John Song played--three-way tie between Only Heart, Something's Missing, and New Deep! Also am the proud owner of a Maroon 5 t-shirt, and a John Mayer sweat band, those were a must!!  I was the "waitress" at the t-shirt stand, I took abby, amanda, jenny's "orders" up there, and about $110 later, I was hated by about 35 other girls, cause I took forever!  oh well, tall, blonde fans need their merchandise too!  Ahh, also got a tattoo there too!  A Henna One!!  haha almost fooled ya!  Its awesome, nicole, kate and I got star ones on our back!  So after meeting up with the crew, we headed to our designated seats, and awaited the arrival of the unbeknownst, DJ Logic.  yeah, probably the gayest thing we saw all day! This guy spinning some records, and playing the most god aweful music before a john concert- rap, and rock mixer!  Horrible!  WEll its off to bed now.  After a long day, its time for some sleep! Happy Birthday Pops!
