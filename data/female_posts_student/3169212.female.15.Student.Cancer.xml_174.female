My initial death was from a tank. The other was when I possessed the Red Armies sergeant, and got shot in the head. Unfortunately, they were able to bring him back to life. Oh, have you ever tried to trick a newly dead man into giving you ten dollars to "get into heaven"? Just wondering. Also, just to straighten things out, I'm a ghost, so being dead to me is just like being alive, only I can be seen through.
