I couldn't be happier with anyone but her! she's, just, i can't describe it. There's no one else for me but her. We couldn't be happier. And I am so proud of her for starting a new life at Northwestern in the coming months. She's going to acquire so much more knowledge and be even smarter than me. We have such an opportunity here to both grow as individuals and make "us" a stronger entity. I love you Sarah!  I hope everyone had a good day! What does everyone think of the new schedule? I think it works out pretty well except for those who have elective tests. I'm sorry to those people that do. Now i have an exam on thursday, but that it isn't a big deal AT all. I don't know if i should go to her funeral. As Sarah put earlier to me, "Funerals are a time for people who knew the person well and family to get together and celebrate her existence." It's very true and I, unfortunately, didn't know her too well. I'll see.   I'm taking 3 AP classes next year. What is the matter with me?! I was trying to create an easier year for myself next year. But i kind of have this raw carnal desire inside me to do AP Chemistry. I have no idea why. I feel that i haven't learned enough about it this year. We'll see how i do. If i have too much work by the first interim, i'll either drop AP chemistry or AP lang and comp.   I had a good day and i'll have four more good days because me and sarah have some really cool things that we're doing in the coming days. Alright, well i can't think of many more things to write about.  I really want to write some more in the coming months. I want to have some solid poetry that i could send to people that I actually like. Sarah has so many amazing stories and poems, ask her to send you some, sometime. I hope some day i could have half of her talent to write. Maybe... All i can do is hope and work to that point.  I'm out for tonight you guys, i'll post tomorrow. Half day!
