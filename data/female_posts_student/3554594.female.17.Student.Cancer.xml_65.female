You say "close your eyes" "tell me what you see" I see only two people, just you and me.  We're walking the shoreline, with our feet getting wet, the horizon turns pink, as the sun starts to set.  We spend every second together, cherishing every second when i am with u on that white sandy shore, then I hold you while thinking, I could want nothing more.  Oh I wish I could be in that one special place, as I lie on the ground, and I stare into space...
