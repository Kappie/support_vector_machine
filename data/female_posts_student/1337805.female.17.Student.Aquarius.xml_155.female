Amen for my thought book. But I went to Infotech today, and I just couldn't stop laughing. (Pardon me while I giggle.) Anything will set me or Peter off. Everyone around us thinks we are crazy. He brought me waffles today. I'm actaully shocked over that because no one has brought me waffles. I'm so giddy. And me and Peter have been laughing since. I wish Infotech was a year-long-course, so then we could laugh together all year long. Peter is a very special person. Special like me. Special like retarded :)  I'm still laughing. Peter's even fallen out of his chair a few times. It's just so hilarious. :) Anyways. I'd better get back to flash. Look for it on my site soon.  *giggle* Adam never emailed me. But he's moving today, so congrats hunny! Hope everything goes alright, and that everything stays as dry as it can in this weather. Lubbes!!  *bursts into laughter all over again* Michelle hates us :D
