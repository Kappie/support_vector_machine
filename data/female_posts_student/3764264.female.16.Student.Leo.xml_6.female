Thinking of later. Thinking of when I can call him or go to the movies with him... Make mistakes with him... Hold him.      I was working yesterday... There was a couple that came in and chatted with the supervisors for thirty, forty minutes or so. Then went to order. I was at the cash register, behind the counter... The guy was standingbehind of the girl, a little close. He must have been a head taller than her. hmmm...They were both looking at the menu and his hands went to the sides of her head then down to her shoulders, massaging a bit. then just kind rubbed the tops of her arms before crossinghis arms across his chest.       It wasn't a "turn on" so to speak. Or even that sexy. I don't think the girl really thought the touching was apropriate from the way she acted. But it was subtle, if she did mind, I don't think she cared all  too  much.       kinda weird, huh? Just that thought kinda stayed.The movements involved were just without thought. Absent. I wonder if I could ever get that point with someone. ... And you know which someone I'm talking about. *smiles*       Maybe we'll end up at the same school, or in the same city. Maybe even a residenc-- well. Nevermind. I hate when people tell me their wedding plans when they don't have a boyfriend. This falls under the same catagory.       But I can say. If we do find eachother... That I want that to be us. I want us to be able to have tenderness. To have making out not be something we'd just do for kicks. But something that's more involved than tounges and hands.       Anyway... Maybe I can't say that?      I love you Erich   -Sage
