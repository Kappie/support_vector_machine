And sometimes I realize that I will never find a boss like Jefe who understands my needs and my quirks (i.e. my selfishness and my neuroticism).    2. It would be cheaper because I would save on an out-of-state tuition fee. More money for play.   3. Montevallo has a journalism program. MUW does not. And the English program is great.    4. I can stay with Lisa until the apartment lease is up, then move into a dorm/my own place. Ever since I moved back in, we've come to an understanding. And I think we're able to keep each other sane for the most part (besides, live-in homework help is always nice).    5. I can be near Mama and Daddy. V.v. important.    6. My daddy wants me to stay here (this revelation came during the most productive conversation we've had in years).        Besides, what it all boils down to is this. I'm going back to school. I only have two years to go. At least I'm doing something productive with my life and my time, instead of living beneath my potential and moving from one dead-end job to another every month. I am so much better than that.        And in other news:        Jefe asked me if I would be willing to sign a waiver to give him permission to call me "Ashehole." He thinks he's so clever (that was Nick's nickname when he played football). I probably will let him. It is kinda funny. At least he wouldn't be calling me "Chili Dog"like another girl.      And I am getting my Gazelle freestyle machine!!!!!!!! I made a deal with Jefe and he's gonna order it for me.    Teehee. Things are sweet.
