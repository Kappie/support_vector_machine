I would do it for you but things would probably turn out worse because of my mouth/temper and then where would we be?  Linds, will you bring me some cupcakes if you can?  I want some.  Having to do with the e-mail, I couldn't possibly care less.  If I get one, I'll either immediately delete it or read it, get pissed, delete it, and have fun planning retribution.  Sigh.  Anyway, divorce update, in case anyone gives a shit.  My dad wanted to turn our dinner tomorrow night into a "Z-sleeps-over-at-Dad's-new-place" night, which I am SOOOO not ready for.  So I basically told him to forget it.  So now he's all down in the mouth.  Mom says it's because he doesn't see me every day anymore, to which I responded, "That was his choice, and now it's his problem."  So, Tao-Tao, if you say, "Smile, life is great" before next August, you will most likely end up in my basement on my rack.  ;)  Because trust me...life sucks.  And then you die.  My old and new philosophy.  Yeah.  Stressing slightly about the big AP test.  Plus it's late and I'm tired and pissed.  So I guess I don't mean some of that.   But I am still mad at my dad and will probably be so for a LOOOOONG time to come.  Would you guys just bear with me?  I really need your support.  Valete.  (Goodbye)  ~Z
