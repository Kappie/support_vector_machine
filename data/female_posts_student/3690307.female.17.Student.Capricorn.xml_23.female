He actually is one of the coolest people in the galaxy. His voice, God... such a master.  Oh btw Lauren, the line is from "Dream a little dream of me"... You know which one I'm talking about?  Wow, it's such a pleasure to sit down and just write right now. Things have been shitty around me, but, I think I'm doing ok. The excitement of University is one of the things keeping me going.  God, I just read some of Orson Scott Card's reviews... He is so good. I wish that I could write like he can. I always say that when I'm writing something really good. Don't be surprised if I've said while reading some of your blogs, because, occasionally, I come across something so pristinely perfect, that I come back and read it again. I'm not meaning to start a competition or anything like that, but I find that when I seems like I can actually hear the voice of the author when I read their blog, it captures the imagination. Lol, run-on sentence... I'm starting to get terrified of the English provincial... I'm retaking it... God, I hope I do better. I'd better study...  So, keep writing in your blogs, so that I can keep on worshipping you. Lol.
