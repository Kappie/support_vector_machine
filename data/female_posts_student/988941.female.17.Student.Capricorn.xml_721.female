I take tablets, I apply funny strange blue liquid after washing, I wipe clean with those pad thingys when ever I come home, but fuck it! Nothing seems to work! I'm being selfish perhaps? Maybe I am, probably am, after all I'm selfish know-it-all twat, arn't I? I think I know everything and I never shut up, do I? Well you're going to put up with me for the next minute or two. Why should I have nice clear skin like everybody else? I don't need to be like everybody else, I'm not a bloody sheep or something. Yep, that's it, I'm a selfish bugger and proud of it. I want clear skin, I want this, and I want that. All me, me, me, me. Is it really so hard!?!? Bullshit there is some all mighty god or what ever the hell people believe in. If there was, stuff like this wouldn't happen. Victor, who is my great-grand-cousin (long title, but he's close), has been ill for a last month and has just passed away in hospital. He was such a nice person, had a lovely family who are now spread all over Europe (6 children!), and he wasn't even that old. Can't believe it, and I don't want to believe it. How can somebody so nice die? Much rather the people who broke into my neighbors house and stole their car died, that would be much nicer. Bastards, they should be shot. Makes me so angry that people think they can get away with it. People so desperate and stupid that they have to resort to crime to get them out of their problems. Go to hell the lot of 'em. So I'm selfish for wanting my family to live as well maybe? I want him back, I want to say goodbye. Is that selfish as well? It's not you, it's me. Ah, fuck it, it's all pointless anyway...
