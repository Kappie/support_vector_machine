I AM JELLO! i should learn to b firm, i should b able to hold my mold, but truth is, im not even jello, i'm like pudding, i don't even hold shape, i look like i do, i seem to have firmness and texture, but really, i don't.  people think (esp. my mom) that i have these high standards that i uphold so well, that i don't give in to anyone, or anything, but she's wrong, she doesn't know me, she know's nothing about me, she's not as observant as she seems to think, she really is quite blind about most things, i mean, ya she believes wut i tell her for the most part, and that's good, she trusts me and all, but she doesn't know me, and she doesn't see me, or how i am, or what my friends r like, even who i hang out w/. i mean i know it's gotta b hard for a parent to know these things, and i don't think it's a bad thing, i don't think she's a poor mother, i think she's great, but i think she's ignorant, and thinks she knows more than she does...she likes the innocent bit she's living, like i think she knows wut my sister and i do, but it's like she never says she does, and i don't think somethings she would approve of, but she never really protests, she just acts like she doesn't know any better.....WUTEVER, wut do i no? im jello! have a wonderful holiday season, changedfish
