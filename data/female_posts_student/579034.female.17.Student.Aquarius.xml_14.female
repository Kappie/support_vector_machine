I do anyone who has been in my room knows how big a fan I was. Well, I just put in "Celebrity" cause it is one of my favorite CD's, and I said to myself, "Self, I wonder if all the *Nsync sites you used to go to are still up?" So, me, myself, and I went to a bunch of my old faves. Most of them have turned into an *Nsync/ Justin Timberlake site. Like Nsyncstudio.com for instance. Nsync.com says that they are working on a new site, which probably means that they are going to be underconstruction for a long time, I mean, *Nsync isn't really top news any more is it? (sob) Good times.. good times. I mean you know your getting older when you take all your old posters off the walls. Anyway, I only came on really to see if Greg or Debra or Mickey or someone was online to talk to and since no one seems to be, I'm going to go to bed and get some beauty sleep. Night! XOX
