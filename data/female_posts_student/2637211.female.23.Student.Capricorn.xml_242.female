I haven't seen my cousins or my aunt since my grandfather's funeral, so it was really nice to see how much everyone has changed and to see where everyone is in their lives. It was also fun to reminisce about old times and to introduce everyone to Jerm. They really liked him, and I think he really liked them. It makes it more clear how important family is, and I'm realizing that I need to spend more time reconnecting with all of my aunts and uncles who my mom has lost contact with. I'm looking forward to this.
