Anyway, life on my side of the bus depot is pretty good. I'm enjoying my spring break, even though I'm still not getting much quiet free time. I have tons to read, a friend to entertain, scholarship stuff to work on, piano contest songs to practice, a room to clean, and several other piling responsiblities to tackle. Oh well. I'm keeping my chin up. Everyone excited to graduate? I sure as hell am.  I'm so, so sorry Betso. We're going to miss you.
