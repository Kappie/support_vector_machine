Ok, well, now it's after 11, but I ate breakfast.(grits and they take a while to make)  I'm happy...no school for me either, today.  My homebound was supposed to come, but she's not.  YAY!!! So, anyway, how are yall celebrating the snow day?  Have fun for me.  I'll be in my usual spot on the recliner. Oh, last night (at 2am, no less) I finished all my AP, all my Alg.II, and most of my vocab. Maybe all of it.  Does anyone know what lesson  we are on?  I'll see yall later.
