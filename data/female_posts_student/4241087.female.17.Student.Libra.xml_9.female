Let me tell you, it was quite a shock when my father decided to buy me this car on eBay. I mean, who does that?! But he did... And it all turned out well! It's a cute little red Subaru Forrester. It'll be awesome to drive around.  Other than that I was forced to spend my time with my relatives and sister. It's alright though 'cause she says some things and you just want to say, "Ellen, what are you talking about?" For example... My uncle was looking into purchasing a go cart online and she asks me, "Didn't we have one of those... But it didn't work so we used to ride it down the hill? I don't know it might have been a dream" I answered, "No, Ellen, we never had one of those." So she says,        "Oh yeah, I guess that was a dream... We did break our necks in it."      It was one of those moments when all I wanted to do was slap myself in the forehead. She keeps me laughing...    Today is Sunday. This means that Tyler should be coming home. Joy of all joys... Maybe he'll call me!
