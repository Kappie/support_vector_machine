This may sound unusal to you for a girl my age to sit at home and do nothing so let my tell you why i am here and not out having fun. Well once a year the school district has this thing called Sertoma, which is where alll the high schools in the district play(football) a 15 min. quarter against another school. There is also like a spirit award and that goes to the school with the most spirit and the most people. Its sorta the kickoff for the football season and well Charleston district has been doing this for like the past 25 years at the same stadium well this year the stadium they usually do it at got torn down and is being rebuilt so they are having it at the biggest school in the county... well so thats the 1st reason why im not going cuz it wouldnt be the same. 2nd reason is becuase all my friends have to work tonight and so im not going by myself. So thats why im stuck at home sitting at my computer typing this. So there ya go. Enjoy!
