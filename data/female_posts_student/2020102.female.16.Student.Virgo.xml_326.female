I can't hear the person I'm trying to talk to." -Jake (right after a lecture the teacher gave us about paying attention to the movie and not talking)  "Watching a boring movie is one thing, but reading one... it's even worse." -Jake when there was subtitles on the screen  "Oh yeah, I forgot I have to slow down here because there's a huge dip. It's really bad for your shock absorbers if you do that, I feel like I'm off-roading, only it's urban off-roading." -Alex
