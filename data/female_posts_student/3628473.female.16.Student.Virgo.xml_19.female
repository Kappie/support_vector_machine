Everything is so not for sure. My God is the only one that can keep up walking on the water. I keep looking at everything else but him. I'm going to drained if i dont keep my fouse... Looking foward to the prize ahead of me. This life means nothing. Then why do i hold it so closely if it means nothing! I'm not going through a hard time with God yal'. Him and i are fine. I just feel really un-worthy right now. I am seeing my prayers answered.... Wanting to see my sins. And now that i see so many of them, i am being saded, at how blind i have been. I think i am going to call Kyle...
