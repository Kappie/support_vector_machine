We were supposed to go out today, but when he didn't call me yesterday, or today, I just figured something else came up for him (in typical Andy style) and made plans with Ashley. And I'm damn glad that I did, because he called me at like 5:30 and the first thing out of his mouth was "You're going to hate me ..." but he was wrong, because I assumed that was going to happen and took the initiative to stop the boredom. I could tell he felt really bad about it this time though. And he definitely felt bad when I started crying, because although I wasn't disappointed that he couldn't go out tonight, I have been kind of disappointed with the fact that he's been AWOL for like two weeks now. He feels bad though, but all ended well. I think. I sort of started zoning out towards the end of the conversation ... oops. My bad.      On a super high note, Ashley and I had a fantastic time tonight, the highlight of my evening being when we were checking out of Giant and she said started talking about Reese's Pieces except she said Reese's Penis instead. That was very entertaining, although our cashier didn't seem to find it quite as amusing as we did. Oh well.      With all of my Reese's Penis,   Your Sweetest b.
