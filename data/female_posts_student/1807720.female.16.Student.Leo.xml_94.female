I like it better now though since people are doing it independantly our class is now SMALL, that's right a small Chem class [I never thought the day would come]I'm so confused with chem and I don't understand AGAIN.  I am sick of never understanding.  It's frustrating.  Chem is really interesting and I really do like things that are related to science but I don't understand.  EVERYONE else understood today.  Literally EVERYONE.  I hate myself so much right now, if I had one wish right now it would just be to understand.  I listened and tried and everything today, I don't want to not understand it but I just don't.  I am sick of always having to ask her how to do things.  I am sick of always needing extra help.  For once in my life why can't I just understand.  Lenny even tried to help me with my chem in rel. after chem class and like he didn't make any sense.  Eric tried to explain it too.  No one makes any sense!  I NEED to do good in chem, I just want SOOOOOO BADLY to be able to do good.  I have put my heart into chem, being a science teacher is my dream.  I want that so bad.  More than anything else in the world.  But when I see how smart my chem teacher is and all the stuff she knows and understands it makes me wonder how I could ever be as smart as her and know as much, and just understand everything.  How could I ever be a teacher?!?  HOW???  And why don't I ever seem to understand things?!?  **FRUSTRATION**  I cannot emphasize that word.  I feel frustrated with just about everything, it's annoying.  The only things I am good at is CALM and Religion because those are courses that are based on mostly effort rather than being based on actual knowledge.  This brings me back to my original thoughts over the summer.  Maybe I have some sort of learning problem, but when I ask the people that know me really well they just tell me that I am crazy for thinking that.  No one understands though.  I KNOW I AM smart of course, I know that and I know others around me know I have a smart side to me too, but what they don't realize is how difficult it is for me to learn.  I don't work or anything and I have cut out EVERTHING extra curricular just to focus on school.  There is NOTHING I can change to make me do a lot better in chem.  I mean EVERYTHING I work my ass off for, and even then that doesn't mean I will get a good mark.  I put in COUNTLESS hours trying to understand and doing homework and stuff.  I NEVER seem to understand anything, but I want to, I want to understand.  That is all.  Why can't God just make me understand.  I would trade EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING I have in my life and this world just to understand.  ANYTHING.  I would do anything.
