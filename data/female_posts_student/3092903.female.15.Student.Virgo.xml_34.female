I know how to keep a fucking secret. I love being all mysterious about what I do and where I've been, so I dont just yell out something that happened to me. The only one time that anythingat nature has happened to me is when I kissed a guy, and I didnt tell anyone but my best friend. My other friend was there though, and she doesnt mind spilling things so on two occasions she put me in that position. I just get what the fuck has been up lately. Criticism has been coming from every direction lately. I'm really sorry and all, and a year ago if all of this had come up, I probably would have cried and tried to fake beingsomeone else or actually change the way I acted, but not now. I think I've grown up enough to take it as constructive criticism and say fuck em all if they keep acting like they have a problem with me and keep giving me a hard time, because I have plenty of other friends and I've long been through with the days of trying to impress people. I am who I am. I love to have fun, and it sucks that it feels like I'm being punished because of a part of my personality that DOESNT EVEN FUCKING MATTER, because it doesnt even concern the situation, b/c i'm not fucking stupid when it comes to things like that. The thing that has happened lately doesnt bother me that bad, but if all of this little sneaking around keeps going on, there's going to be a change. I hate it when people think they've pulled a fast one on me, so I'll go hang out with some of my other friends I've missed this summer. I just hope that was a one time deal. I also hope people try to get to know me before they make assumsions about my character. Because three people, wait 4,have made these comments. One is full of bullshit, because I've had about 5 conversations with him and I never try to touch him b/c I'm not attracted to him at all. The second one kinda sucks because I know him pretty well, but I dont know wherehe gathered what hesaid from and he didnt even say it to myface,which made me feel like he was making assumptions. Oh well, I dont even care b/c its over. But the third guy told this same friend, but we're cool and it was just an offhanded comment, not in a mean way. And the fourthguydid say it to my face and all, and I'm not mad, but his deal wasnt even my fucking fault. He just misread something I said. Oh well, nothing I can do aboutit right now besides feel better about it now that I've thought it out and talked with this tiny bug, Henry, that is crawling across my kitchen floor. :) Anchorman was hirious. I will be quoting it for weeks...
