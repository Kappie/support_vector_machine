I need to snap out of it and make new friends and hopefully going to this new junior college will help me with that.  It is right down the street so i will meet more people around this area.  I just need to meet people I can go out with and stuff.  So I was thinking, my problem with going to the gym is I know I am overweight and I am super self conscious about my weight.  I have a wedding to go to in a little over amonth and everyone will be staring at me and telling how FAT I still am.  So I want to try and lose a few pounds before that wedding.  I also want to be healthy.  I don't eat a lot but I don't do a lot either.  So after I do a hour or so of homework, I am going to do some major cleaning.  I have taken my meds and it is kind of working.  We will see.  Take care    HAPPY BIRTHDAY MICA!    Join the 27 club!  Damn we are getting old...we all need to do something BIG the year we turn 30!
