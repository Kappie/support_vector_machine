You light up my life with each passing day,  Now that I have found you,  I will never let you get away.     The beauty of your smile, and  the warmth of your heart.  The great inner beauty you possess,  is what won me over,  and did from the very start.    As I sit here and think of you,  the memories of how we met  are ever so strong.  You came into my life  at a time I felt so alone.     All of my life I've longed  for someone who would love me,  for whom I am and nothing more.  You captured my mind and soul,  so you, my love, you are the key  to my heart's door.     Each day we are together,  is another day in paradise.  Knowing I've finally  found someone to love me,  surely does feel so nice.     No more lonely days and nights,  for they are gone forever, never to come again.  Since you came into my life,  I have so much love to  give to you from within.     The birds are flying high in the sky,  singing melodies of love found for you and I.  My body, soul and mind  are yours until the day I shall die.     And even after then...  the memory of love we have for each other  will speak to us for all eternity.  And another page of love  will be written in history.    As days go by let's you and I  keep this love we have between us alive.  As the hair on our heads grows gray,  we will look back at these precious memories of love  with a smile.    There will be no one who  can take this love away from us.  Because in God and each other,  we will forever put our trust.     All of my life I have dreamed  of a love so true and pure,  like yours.  Now that I have found you,  throughout all eternity this  love of ours will always endure.     I know we both are human  and are prone to make mistakes.  All of our mistakes, we will work through,  for true love is our fate.     This day I pledge my love to you for always...  for better or for worse, until death do us part.  Our hearts will blend into one heart.  You and I will always be  the reality that dreams do come true.   All of my life I have dreamed of you,  Now my soul is at peace forever.  For you are here finally.
