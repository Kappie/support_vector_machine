Ok back to being cynical realist/pessimist... well i failed to be a good person again..went back to the old ways for a bit...but i kno i gotta be stronger than that...i am so easy and numble .. soo stupid..i am not open minded and won't except it at any level......i am so stupid...   the sunlight blinds my face as a i walk through a forest but something is a little bit different this time the path way seems to have accumulated more mud and humus  leeching out a foul but familiar unidentifiable smell the trees cool me off with their flappin leaves  and the grass looks like a cold treat ready for me to relax on  i keep on walking not knowing where i am going and soon i hit a bridge overlapping a pond it cuts off in the middle and leads to two seperate places: the beautiful yet materialized city and the peacefull and calm forest my feet begin to carry me to the middle of this bridge should i exit back into society..or stay with the genuine beauty of God?    hmm jsut a little free flow of mind..trying to improve on it but whatever..there is a lot of symbolism in this..so yeah...oh wellz nuff i with the ramblings i'm out..peace  [recovering]
