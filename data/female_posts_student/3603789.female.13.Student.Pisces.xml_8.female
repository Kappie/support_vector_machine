The U.S. government has to go further on than that and lie that, quote,"no children have died." Now this is getting even worse than I thought it would be. Our economy is down. WAY down. Gas is almost $2. Big company scandals are popping up everywhere. When is the this going to end? Lets hope that Bush does not get reelected.
