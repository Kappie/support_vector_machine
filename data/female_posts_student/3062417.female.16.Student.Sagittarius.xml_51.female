Well, speaking of solo fest, I've got to go practice now. I hate practicing at home because then everyone can hear me. Maybe I'll go lock myself upstairs in my room so I atleast feel alone. I feel pretty calm considering everything that's going on.  Well, I just got back from that stupid mother-daughter dinner thing at church. It was mucho boring. But atleast it was something to do.   And thanks to the people that try to cheer me up. I appreciate it a lot.  Song: And we wait above a road We're turning to go home And the silence from the side of the car Tells me everything and how we are   There's no more trying to make it so right There's no more trying tonight   CHORUS: And you know it's not so easy when you're all alone And I wonder if I'm alone in your head  I know something is wrong, I just don't know what to do You say it's only me and that I'm so perfect for you  I don't want to try no more I don't want to make this right I just want you to be true to me one time   CHORUS  Twelve days gone by since I have saw you last I'll give this one more try I'll give it all my best and I'll ask   What could you be doing that is so much fun? Without me by your side Without me by your side     And I'll take a step back and I'll let you ahead And I will take a step away and see if you come back Because there's no more trying to make it so right There's no more trying, there's no more trying tonight   We'll never be the same We will never be the same We will never be the same We will never be the same Until you're done -Sunday Drive- The Early November
