But still, a another whole year at Charter...mixed emotions...like always. Last year wasn't that great for me, sophomore year was awesome, so I'm thinking maybe every even numbered year will be good. I do have a couple classes I'm looking forward to so that should be nice. I still have a LOT of that summer reading stuff to do though, one more whole book (not counting like the 10 I am SUPPOSED to be reading for drama) and a bunch of essays. Everyday I tell myself I'll work on them, but what do ya think happens? Nothing of course. But oh well I know a lot of people are in the same situation. I remember last year at this time I was killing myself while trying to get through that Founding Brothers book...oh my can't think of that too much, you know just looking at the cover still makes me cringe.   Ahh well it is now 1:40pm and I'm just now going to go take a shower to start my day. That my friend, is summer.
