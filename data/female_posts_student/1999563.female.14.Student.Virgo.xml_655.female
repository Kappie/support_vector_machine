My goodness! Flossing is for weirdos. ;)  I just got otu of the shower and I am just waiting till 6:30. What happens then you may ask...I am going to a play!! With Beka and some other CYT people!! It's at New Heights. I am so excited. I wonder if Tim is back form Cali yet. Humm.  Everyone is coming over to my hosue afterwards and we are going to have root beer floats! Yay!!!!!!  I am quite excited.  DID I TELL YOU I'M SEEING KERRY TOMORROW?? I have my tickets and everything!!!! Guess who is going ot be there. Hahhahahaha!!! Bon Jovi and Leonardo Decaprio!!!!!!!!!!! Hahhahahhahahaha!!!  it's totally not as good as seeing Sean Astin last time but at least kerry is trying.  I have never heard any of Bon Jovi  songs so seeing him in concert will be interesting...hahah.    I have never seen any movies with Leo, so seeing him should be interesting.... :)  I can't wait!!  I hope it isn't to crowded. I am charing my camera batteries right now so you all will get to see plenty of pictures!! Tomorrow the olympics also start!! I am going to Heather M.'s house for a party to watch the opening ceremonies!! HOW EXCITING!!   I love my life.
