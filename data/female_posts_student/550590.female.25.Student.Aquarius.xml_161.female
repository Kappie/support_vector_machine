I've been getting in all those ebay items I blew all my money on and now it's like Christmas every day.  Bruce and I went on our cruise this weekend and it was great...until I fell so ill the third day that I had to be taken off the boat in a wheelchair on Sunday morning. We thought it was a flu because I was all achy and feverish. Then my fever spiked to 103.5 and I couldn't move and I was shaking all over saying I was freezing and crying because I was afraid I was going to die. Turns out I have a pretty severe kidney and bladder infection. Fun stuff. Thankfully my doctor doesn't know I'm sitting up at the computer(for the first time in 5 days) writing my blog.   You know, I just wasn't getting enough attention this weekend. :) Bruce and I had a good time in Nassau and we'll defintely be going on another cruise in the future...with better medical supplies on hand. Alright, 3 paragraphs and I'm exhausted. Time to go back to laying on the couch watching re-runs of The West Wing. Pictures and details (not too many, don't worry) from the cruise to follow.  ~D~
