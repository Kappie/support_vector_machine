       
      I rode my bike to the festival this afternoon, in hopes of finding some friends. I did, and I had a pretty decent time for a while, but then I left, and now I'm back here. I'm sorry to Tracy and Joe, who I kinda ran out on. Well, without the kinda. I'm tired. I knew I should have gotten some coffee while I could. Oh well.  It happens.
