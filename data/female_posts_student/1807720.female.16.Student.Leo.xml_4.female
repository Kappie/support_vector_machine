Well basically all I did was *Majorly* clean my room today cause I all of a sudden had this like erge for everything to be clean.  Sure is funny isn't it.  And well tonight I think I am going to watch some sappy movie my Mom rented even though I don't really care for those but later at 9:00 PM they are having a special Big Brother Episode where there is going to be a surprise 'twist' to the show.  I can't wait!  And well Reichen and Chip won the Amazing Race which I totally think they deserved and well the new Survivor is starting some time in September so I am really exited for that!
