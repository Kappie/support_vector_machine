Take the following for example. Will someone tell me what this means?  "No, I think there's a thing when you look at someone who has ethics presence, when it's like, you're going to have to deal with me as a human being. I went to a lot of different schools growing up, so I can relate to that. It's like, I am who I am"  The only explanation I have for this is that he read something like this out of L. Ron Hubbard's "Sound Smart and Obtuse"!  Here is another gem...again with the "went to a lot of different schools" bit!   Tom Cruise : Life's going to bring you problems. Was that a bit of a shock to you?    Jada Pinkett-Smith : Hell, yes.   Tom Cruise : It was a bit of a shock to me. I remember, I went to so many schools, I didn't even go to my graduation. I was just like, "I am out of here, man. I am sick of these problems." Suddenly, it struck me one day: "Okay, Life is problems." And you know what? I know of like some of these problems. And then there's a day when I went, "Okay, you mean I have a choice sometimes of what problems I want?" It's like you want to work, you want to raise your family, you want everything. And people are saying, "Well, you can't have everything." Well, I don't know about that.  What the fuck, Tom Cruise?
