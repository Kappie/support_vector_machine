BEcause there was no need to! We already did the studying in our projects.. I blame myself for freaking out after knowing that LCW actually read the whole text.. Serves me right for being too kaypo! But coming up next is the project.. I'm so nervous about the presentation.. But I'll survive.. I gotta go watch TV now.. I can finally watch tv without feeling guilty... Liberation!  Still gotta meet up for project though  See ya blog...
