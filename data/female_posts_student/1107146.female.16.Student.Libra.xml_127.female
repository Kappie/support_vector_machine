And second...heheheheh. Ok, so I had a little episode on the bus whereafter I was given a little slip of paper by a kid which read "Mental Help Line, 333-333". Tomorrow, I'm going to threaten to beat him up because I was on the verge of hanging myself and instead I killed my cat, or something like that. It'll be so much fun, I've always hated that kid for some reason. But yes, I started screaming at the top of my lungs at the absolutely TERRIBLE songs on the radio. GOD I HATE NO DOUBT AND WHOEVER THAT OTHER ASSHOLE WAS I FORGOT BUT THEY STILL  SUCK .  And as for mentioning that website...haha. It's going to take a lot of explaining.   How'd you enjoy all these wonderfully outrageous and long posts, chock full of teenage hormonal ambition and such? Bet you sat there going "oh god" at the beginning of all of them, because I still sure do.  The end...sort of.
