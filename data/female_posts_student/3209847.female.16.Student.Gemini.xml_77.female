Hopefully some honors credit. I need it on that stupid list. I'm sorry that I sound ocmplainy, I was just REALLY hoping for AP Chemistry, and it didn't happen. That just makes me mad and sad. I'm not feeling very good about things right now. I mean, my schedule next year is pretty easy. It'll be hard, but still. I need a challenge, and I'm afraid I made my schedule TOO easy. Whatever, it will still overload me. I just don't feel that I'm good enough at any ONE thing to make it in this world. I'm destined to become an average retail salesman or a cubicle working dopehead. I'm just so tense and jittery, its making me nauseous.  I hope everyone else feels better than I do. I want to become a better actress. I'm going to go look for classes RIGHT now online. After that I'm going to write the rest of my reader's log, and then maybe go to sleep. I'm sorry that this post can't be longer, i'll post tomorrow. Everyone have a good night. Sleep well  *kisses* to sarah. i don't deserve you, but i still have you. You're wonderful
