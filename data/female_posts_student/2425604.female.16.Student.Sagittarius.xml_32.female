I think it's time to move.  The winters so cold,  the summers over to soon.  So lets pack our bags  and settle down where palm trees grow.   i hate winter... if we dont have school im gonna cry .. i really rather have school because im so sick of sitting home alone with the boy playing sims in my pjs... i wanna go out places and see things... some ppl just think everything is awesome because they have privaleges that i dont ... teh ... ill deal... i can walk places... it doesnt bother me ... but if you could drive michelle that would be cool... yea it would be cool considering that fact that if i had gotten my permit by now I STILL WOULDNT BE DRIVING because im younger and all this bragging is pissing me the fuck off .. o yea i can drive here and go out to dinner here ... cuz I CAN DRIVE... well ass hole i cant so i dont care ... im done bye
