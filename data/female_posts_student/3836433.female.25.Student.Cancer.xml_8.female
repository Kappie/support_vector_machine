I can't really blog my poetry because that would be like publishing it, and then I wouldn't be able to submit to journals for the express intent of publishing.  And I have a pen  paper journal I already write my thoughts in on a day to day basis.  One interesting thing is that I wrote a poem last year with the image of a hurricane in Florida, and now a hurricane is really in Florida.  That makes me feel kind of clairvoyant.
