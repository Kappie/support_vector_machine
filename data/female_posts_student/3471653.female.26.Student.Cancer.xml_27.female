What I really want is to sit down, stop thinking,and watch a movie--preferably the last two  Lord of the Rings  movies again,but I'd settle for the BBC  Pride and Prejudice, or  Star Wars , orsome other movie withcostumes, sceneryandabrave heroine.   We could go to themovie theater, but our schedule makesit hardfor us to see movies together on the cheap. However, we do have some entertainment coming up. Saturday I'm driving Matt to his Raleigh classes and then going to a baby shower for  urlLink Katie Stewart .Matt and I picked out the gift together in an aisle full of baby stuff. It's the tiny socks and shoes that really get me--we had to leavethe aislelest I decide to conceive, right there and then. (We weren't surehow Target would feel about it.)   In the more distant future lie  urlLink the 2004 Perseid Meteor Shower , which I've missed every year since I got to Carolina, the visit of my friend Patrick (more on him later), and our trip to Alabama with the Harpers.
