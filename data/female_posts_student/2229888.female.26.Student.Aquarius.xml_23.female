It's actually been alot of fun, and hopefully you'll see it on your local book store shelves soon!  I am submitting directly to a publisher that has promised to let me know within 3-4 months whether or not my manuscript is excepted. The catch is this; I have to submit this manuscript only to them! Oh well . . . At least I don't have to worry about my manuscript decorating a slush pile! I 'll keep y'all posted.  My brothers are leaving! Going off to school! I can't bear the thought of living here wiithout them. I know it's for the best, but I am a selfish person and I want them to stay! LOL Actually, I am glad for them, and I am doubly thankful for the internet as a means to communicate with them!
