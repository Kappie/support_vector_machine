Why can't I let things go? It's like my mind hates the thought of no so much that it almost blocks the whole concept out and replaces it with the constant need for yes. It's eating me up. I know I need to move on but I can't. I want to but I can't.   But is hope every really lost? Isn't there always some sort of distant possibility that maybe that yes will come my way? I think it's this that keeps me going. It's the chance, no matter how slim it may be, that maybe things aren't over. The future is so unexpected. It's this that drives me crazy, and it's this that keeps me sane.
