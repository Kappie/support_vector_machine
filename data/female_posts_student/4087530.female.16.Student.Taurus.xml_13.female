Ahem, well but I watched my brother spending a pretty long time (in general due to the length of the game) with Roth.  "Goodness reflects the light and evil bears the seed of all darkness. These are the mirrors of the soul, reflections of the mind. Choose well." - Unknown  The unexpected death of his father draws Adam Randall to Helston, a village in Cornwall, into a seemingly forlornly, old manor-house. Unknown to him, Adam enters the showplace of a battle between Good and Evil which is already lasting several milleniums - and that being the reason of Adam´s nightmares.  As Adam you betake into a colossal and complicated 3D world with more than 20 different, with Motion Capture rendered kinds of demons, 15 varying weapons for your defense and more than 2 hours of integrated video sequences which content clues and make clear the objective target.  In the course of this adventure epos you will be willingless fascinated by the obfuscatory mights of the Realm and the potencies of an old french magician whose aim is to throw the world into an age of darkness. (text translated from the backside of the german CD carton)  Throughout the "game sessions" with my brother respective afterwards (that is NOW) I´m/ was really drawn to the game and everything amounting it. I also plan to create an adaption of Roth on  urlLink RPG Maker 2k , but recently I was pretty flegmatic and unmotivated, I hope I´m soon ambitious and enthusiastic enough to start and end this project in a good way.
