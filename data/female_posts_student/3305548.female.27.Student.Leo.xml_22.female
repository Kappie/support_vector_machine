The Bina  Clones for President(s) campaign seeks to bring new meaning to the term "multi-tasking." Our country will finally be equally served on all fronts by a cooperative group of politicians - our president! Not only able to give commencement speeches, be at a UN meeting, and raise a family all at once - our Bina and Clones President will also be able to make so many public appearances it will make the paparazzi dizzy!  Each Clone identically agrees with and supports the policies made by the others. They are networked together and update on a regular basis via wireless modems so that they keep up to date on the work that they are each doing. Plus, the Clones will bring other clones into the cabinet. This will mean that there will be no understaffing and no need for interns. What a cost saving measure! Taxpayers of the US unite - pay one person and get the work of 4! Sounds like the average corporate or government structure doesnt it?  Bina and Clones is guaranteed to have a politcal platform of some sort. She is guarateed to be a snazzy dresser, a smart cookie, and to give Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen a run for their money as most popular look-alikes.  Get out and VOTE for Bina  Clones - when she takes over the world it  will  be a better place.
