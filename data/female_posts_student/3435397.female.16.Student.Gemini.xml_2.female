Well right now I am not doing great in English and I guess you know why because GRAMMAR FUCKING SUCKS ASS!!!!!!!! opps is that caps sorry I don't give a shit! And I used a lot of exclamation marks who cares?! If you really have a big problem with this instead of embarrassing me on my own website tell me in person, msn, or e-mail me! That's why you aren't going to the football game with me! And I don't give a shit about your 'pet peeves' I have enough of my own that I don't have to worry about yours. I don't look at your site you don't look at mine if you have that big of a problem with it! Later Gator  P.S. I asked you once to stop and not to worry abou it politely but after that last comment I am sorry but that just kind of pissed me off and when I get pissed off I am a bitch! Okay my Christian side really didn't show writing this but I feel a lot better!
