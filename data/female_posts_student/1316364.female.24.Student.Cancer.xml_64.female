I have been talking to Jesse off and on all day, just the normal chitchat we would usually have if he were here. I have been having my sleeping issues again but I think not having Jesse home contributes to the tossing and turning.   The topic for the week, mind you its only Tuesday, has been what will our kids be and look like. Yesterday I found the cutest onesie with Sponge Bob Square Pants and Metallica (can be viewed here:  urlLink http://www.hottopic.com/store/product.asp?LS=0=862370=343 ) on it. Jesse and I were talking about how it’s a pity that we don’t have a little ones to dress up in it. Jesse doesn’t know about this (but if he happens to read this entry he will) but Angela gave me 2 plastic bins filled with Baby Girl Clothing. I looked through it and just fell in love with the idea of having a little one to dress up in little dresses and hats and teeny tiny shoes. I know there is more to having children than dressing them up, I know about the feeding, cleaning, changing, doctor appointments and such. In fact I am probably over prepared to start a family, after all I am an ECE Student.  I told Jesse a few days back that I was very confident that he was going to be a great father. I know he would love, care and provide for his kids and would do whatever it would take to make sure that they had everything they needed and at the same time he would make sure our needs were being met too.   I am very confident that we are going to be good parents.   Why, when we are hundreds of miles apart, do we decide to start a family?
