We left right after school for the 8:15 movie.  Don't ask, I didn't get it either.  We then went to the mall, and looked around for less than an hour, and promptly headed to the Mexican Restaurant.  It was spicy, and people were smoking.  Bleck.  But don't tell  Abner, he's already threatened to break up with his girlfriend (jokingly of course) because she said that it was over rated.  I was impressed with how much those boys can eat.  They each spent $5-10 on food and they ate it all.  I spend a total of $1.23 and was fine.  Agamemnon told us a really  funny story about one of the people he works with who is apparently not the brightest fellow.  They told him that there were no left-handed straws left, and he needed to go put some more out.  They told him to look right next to the right handed coffee cups, and he should be able to fisn them.  So he goes back, and looks for about 10 mins, and returns to report that he couldn't find them.  Acting frusterated, they tell him that it's really not that  hard, they're right next to the right-handed coffee cups, he can't miss them.  Then they go so far as to tell him that if he can't find them, he's moping when they close.  With a downcast face he heads back, and searches for another few minutes.  He returns once again, to tell that he still couldn't find them.  So they send him back to someone else to ask where they might be.  He informs this poor guy that they are in the sky hook.  (there is no sky hook)  So he's wandering around looking for the non-existent sky hook, and the left-handed straws.  They did let him konw eventually that there were no left handed straws.   After this we went to the park which was rather fun, and then we arrived at the movie 45 mins early, to get good seats apparently.  So since we were sitting there for so long, the movie theater people came in, and one of them told us that his friend Andrea was going to come in, and that we should make fun of her.  So as she walks in, Agamemnon yells, Hey Andrea.  And she looks at him, and looks again, and then goes "Oh, Hi!"  and continues to her seat.  Her theater friend approved.  I would be wiling to bet she tried to figure out who he was for a long time.     Sadly I missed Giles' reception tonight.  I really wish I could have gone.  Wonder Woman got to go, and she got to be an ion.  I mean I've been an electron, but never an ion.  It sounded like a lot of fun.  So I'm sorry Giles, and I'm even more sorry about the not I wrote and had Wonder Woman put in your card.  I suck at writing stuff like that.  But that one was praticullarily bad.    I realy should get some sleep tonight though, so it's off to bed for me.  Goodnight stars, good night sheep, goodnight chair, goodnight moon.
