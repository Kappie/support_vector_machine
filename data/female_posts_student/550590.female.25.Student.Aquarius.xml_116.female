(If you read this and you're in Florida and you didn't get one, it's probably because I didn't have your email in my address book for some reason, or I emailed your significant other instead.)  Let me know and I'll send it to you.  Unless of course you're on the shitlist.  :)  Work still sucks, I'm still sick and I'm tired and cranky, too.  But at least now I have a goth devil costume to compliment my attitude.    This is gonna be a short entry because I'm tired and I haven't AIMed with folks in a while, but I'm still making that effort to blog more often.  Hope you're all well.  Email soon.  :)  ~D~
