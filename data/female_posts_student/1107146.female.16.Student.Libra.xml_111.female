So the deal is, DI is going to  eat  this entire weekend. All Friday, all Saturday, I won't get home 'til 1498247591275 o'clock on Saturday. And I'll be carrying about a thousand Cokes with me too. So I'll be completely psyched out for the competetion. It's going to be fun and stupid. Mostly since we're heading into almost certain defeat with nearly cheery countenances.  My family is a bunch of warmongers.  Again, I hear the corruption running rampant in my loyal coruptees. It's actually getting to be a guilty pleasure. And I know that those involved will use such prhases as "WELL! See if I (insert actions here) again!" Those actions are mostly "talk to you". And of course, in five minutes, they do.  REMEMBER, YOUR CORRUPTION IS YOUR OWN AND YOU ARE ASKING FOR IT, I DON'T GIVE ANY OF THIS SHIT VOLUNTARILY, I AM COAXED TO IT. SO SHUT UP .  My bum hurts. Stupid cats.  And PRAY for me this weekend. Just hope, at least, that I don't go mad from the anxiety. I neglected to mention to the team that I am a dunce in public competetions.  Whoops.
