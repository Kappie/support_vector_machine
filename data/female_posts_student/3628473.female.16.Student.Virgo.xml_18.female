Cause i have alread gotten into an crash. Not a big one. But it still stinks... I'm just scared. My mom has distoryed more then one car. And i dont want to do the same. But i really want to drive cause it would help alot with things. But i got to thinking about Worship. And how people think that the only time we worship God is at church. How did they come up with that conculesen? From others around them only doing that? I'm not sure. But how? I was thinking about the church saying it. I dont know if thats true. All i know is that thats the way i was thinking. About 3, 2 years ago. And something else that came to mind, and has been for a while. And my life. I always think when i'm praying "Wow i am doing a great thing, God is happy!" Or reading my bible. But thats not true. I'm sure God delights in it. but the truth is there are time i chose to not pray. Or read. Its funny i could think wow i'm being a great christian. But maybe to someone else, i'm really far from it. And even comparied to God. And how Jesus was, i'm not that great... Stupid Pride!
