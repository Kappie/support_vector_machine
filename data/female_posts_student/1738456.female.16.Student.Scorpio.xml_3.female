I noticed the glow wasn’t coming from stars like I had thought. They were coming from people. These people were perched in the trees like large birds. Some high, some low. All of them looked out of the world I was presently in. None spoke, but their glassy eyes seemed to scream. I turned away to keep from crying.   A small girl with dark hair leaned back against the tree. She was a pale blue. The tree behind her was sickly, dying. Her tears shone out, frozen on her face, glowing like diamonds.  “Are you okay?” I asked  “No,” she said not looking up at me. Her hair was short, and scraggly. She scratched at her head with her arm. There was a long needle stuck deep inside a vein. A small circle of her skin was the color of the tree. The blue tint of the rest of her seemed to have ruptured from the vein the needle was in. I sucked in air hard. A branch fell from the tree.  “Please, let me take that from you,” I begged her.  “Take what?” She asked puzzled.  “The needle!” I said panicked.  “But I need it to live in the tree, you can’t have it. I want to be up there, you’re not allowed.”  “I don’t want to be in your tree! It’s dying!” I almost yelled at her. “Please let me help you…” I reached for her arm.  “No!” she snatched her arm away from me and held it close. Then she pushed the needle in deeper. “It’s not working!” She called up to the tree. It swayed in response. Decaying as it spoke. The trees around it grew larger to take away it’s space.  “You’re killing yourself,” I said softly. The girl looked up at me. Her eyes were black. ‘R’ scratched itself into the bark slowly as she stared at me.  “You’re lying. I can’t die now. I’m too young,” she said in a small voice.  “No, no. I can help you. Just let me take the needle out of your arm,” ‘I’ scratched itself next.  “If I was dying wouldn’t I know?” The white around her eyes got darker.  “Please…” I said desperately, “Please let me help you.” Her eyes were now filled in with black. ‘P’ was the last of the letters to be etched in the tree.  “I know a secret,” she said. The tears on her face reflected me many times.   “I can help you, just give me your arm. I can save you,” This time she held out her arm willingly. The needle had been shoved all the way through her skin. Nothing remained above.  “But I’m already dead,” she said finally, staring at me, her black eyes probing my soul. The blue in her skin darkened slightly. Wings sprouted from her back. Her body lifted heavily into the air as her wings flapped. I stepped back not knowing what to think as the tree she had been at sunk into the ground leaving nothing but a pile of ashes and a small rock with her name on it.  She lowered herself slowly stepped down at the ground and a tear slowly rolled down my face, she kissed it away.  “Dream as if you’ll live forever. Live as if you’ll die today,” she whispered in my ear. Then she faded away.   I looked back up at these trees. All of the people in them were sad, trying to fly. I wanted to help them, they were all too far gone. I knew, that somehow, I was going to be one of them if I didn’t move. So, I started walking. A boy reached down and grabbed my hair. Another girl grabbed at my shirt. I started running. Arms dropped out of the trees grabbing at me.  “But you need a tree.”  “How can you live on the ground.”  “Come up here, up high, with us,” They all called at me. I ran faster. I didn’t want a tree. I needed out of the forest. A path unwound itself a little farther on. I ran until I reached it. Then I slowed to a steady walk.   The trees here were normal, no people were hanging out of them. I sighed and looked down the path. A long way off, I could see a castle, well the top of it really. I didn’t know if that was what I was aiming for, but at least it was something. So I walked towards the castle, trying to never let it leave my sight.
