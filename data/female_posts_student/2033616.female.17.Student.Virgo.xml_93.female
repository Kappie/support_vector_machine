I'm simply analyzing my own thoughts. so don't read if you don't want to... and i'm kinda hoping you won't  I sometimes feel like I have all the burdens of having a relatively large, diverse array of close friends, but never fully reap the benefits.  Not that I have 50 close friends or that these are my only friends (you're all my friends), but the 3-5 very close people in my life bring a little hectic-ness to the social spectrum.     Allow me to analyze.  First of all there is Kayli.  I love Kayli and we have been the best of friends since the 4th grade, however i have since acquired other extremely close knit friendships.  Friendships take time and there are only 24 hours in a day and seven days a week.  Sometimes i feel worn thin between one group of friends and the other.  I love to spend time with Jamie, Aris, and Lindsey, but it's hard to make it all the way over to the other side of town.  Additionally, efforts to combine the groups have been more frenzied than fun.  Doing so requires basically forcing people to mesh... you can't do that.  To throw another problem into the mix, Chad used to be included in many many activities involving the posse.  This is no longer the case because, though rifts have mended and friendships are being rebuilt, it's just not back to that point yet.    So far... I need to give Kayli more time, i have neglected our friendship.  I want to give attention to "the posse," what happened last fall was not fun, and the best way to keep that from happening again is to stay connected.  And, with Chad leaving for college, I don't want to let things just fade out before he leaves.  Now... back at school.  Laura and I were close friends in middle school as I'm sure you are aware, but after that things faded.  Happily, we are closer than ever, and on the same level (hurray for us Laura!!).  During the point in the year when things with the posse were basically sour, or nonexistent for one reason or another, Laura and I grew quite close.  She's exactly what I needed while i was dealing with the drifting of 4 very very close friends.  Now, things in the church realm have been nearly returned to the high we were at last year.  Things are great and growing, but once again this poses a problem.  I could not possibly return to the way things were last year with Laura, i will not do that to such a close friend.  But once again, for things in the posse to return, more time is going to be spent together, but not so much that i'm turning my back on other people again, like Laura, Kayli, and Kayla.  So these are the burdens of my close friendships... with all that, why do i feel so left out?  The time crunch is not all in my mind, b/c most of these people have identified times when i've decided one person over the other, one friend for another.  But with the feeling of being worn thin, how is it that it's 8 o'clock at night on a day with no school, i have no more homework, and no one is around?  People are busy, i know this, Laura is at rehearsal... and the others... well i don't know.  The thing is, i can't give my whole self to one person or one group, therefore i can only take what I put in.    Now you see, (talking to no one... b/c i'm sure you've stopped reading) i have figured it out with my long thought process.  Because I can't devote undivided attention, I can't expect to receive undivided attention.  tada... and my post is finished... i'm still bored and lonely but hey... i understand why???
