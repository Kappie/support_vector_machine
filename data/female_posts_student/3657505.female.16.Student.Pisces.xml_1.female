Well, guess what, it happened to me today. Let me tell you the story, for the purpose of this I will give everyone code names.  So, start of a new year, and you sit down in the classroom. First lesson is so completely boring you think your going to kill yourself or more than likely, drop the class. Next lesson, a guy you know but don't really know, we'll call him "Joe", sits in the only empty seat in the class, which just so happens to be right beside you. Suddenly you start talking, and over the year this guy becomes a ray of shining light in a once boring class. You become friends, best friends almost. But of course, you being female, and a teenager, you start to get a crush on Joe. Because Joe is good looking, and funny, and pretty much the right guy for you. So anyway, over time this crush grows. Until it reaches the stage where you go "Crap, I could ask him out, but if he says no then I'll lose one of my best friends..."  Thus leaving you in a catch-22. And catch-22's aren't fun.   This story has no ending, no happy conclusion. Just a puzzle. One that has yet to be solved. Any help and comments are greatly appreciated.
