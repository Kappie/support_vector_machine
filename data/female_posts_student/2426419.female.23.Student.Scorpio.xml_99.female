I just tel myself I can do anything for two more weeks. Bring it on! To Cody, about your "relationship topic." I was listening to NPR a while back and there was this author that was being interviewed - Ethan Watters, and he wrote about urban tribes and how people in our generation are delaying marriage even into our 30s and 40s for various reasons (furthering our education, we don't want to get divorced, careers, etc.) and it sounded pretty cool what he had to say. There's a website called urbantribes.net. You should read all the little gems. Some of the stuff is so funny, yet serious. Stuff about how to get the 'rents off of our back and whatnot.    It is hard to be growing up and think how we are def. past our parents generation's marrying age. My mom got married at 19. That's about the time I had my first boyfriend! (I'm a late bloomer relationship-wise, I guess). And after I broke up with him, I was really sad, so this girl (who also had broken up with her boyfriend) and I did a project together for our class and surveyed about 200 people at our school asking about their past/current realationships. Anyway, we called the booklet we made "What to do while waiting for Mr. or Ms. Right." And it's all about celebrating your singleness. YAY. I can send it to you if you want. It has very insightful, uh, insights from tons of people, plus stats on what percentage of freshmen, etc. were dating, married, etc. That's all.    Where's Jaci? I miss you Jaci! Jaci, join the blog.
