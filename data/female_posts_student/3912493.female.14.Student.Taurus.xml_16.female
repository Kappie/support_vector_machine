I haven't had this much fun in years. My brother and I got there at around 3.20 PM or so, and the gates weren't open yet. My dad gave us 20 dollars each, but that wasn't enough to buy something decent. So anyway, at around 3.30 the gates opened, and once we were inside I quickly bought a water of bottle for $4.25. Expensive, yes? I wanted to buy a shirt of Interpol or something, but they were like $30 dollars each, so whatever. I borrowed some money from my brother and we bought the shirt...so kick arse! I love it. The shirt is simple. It's black, has the words "Interpol" written on it in dark gray letters and...that's it. I love it. =P  At 4.20, the gates to the main stage opened. The first group was gonna play at 5 PM, but I didn't know them so who cares. We got to sit in the lawn, but that's alright since you could move freely from the main stage to the back stage. There were a lot of people walking back and forth, and while the first group got ready, we just kept looking at people and how weird they were dressing. We saw two grandmas, and I'm guessing that they just came to see The Cure since they're an 80s group. But anyways, there were a lot of goths, bangers and punks. Some creepy, some weird, and some spiffy. I think I can safely say that I was the only 14-year-old-girl that was at that concert.  The first group was crap. It was just a bunch of loud guitars, loud singers, and more loud guitars. The good thing was that they were only gonna play for 30 minutes. At 5.30 my brother and I went to the backstage to see the second group performing. This one was better, though the singer was acting kind of gay. XD  6 o clock and we had to go back to the main stage to see the next group. I didn't know them either, so blah. Interpol was gonna perform from 7.30 - 8.10, which is not enough for an awesome band like them. Then at 9 PM The Cure was gonna play, and it would last until 11 PM. Once the third group finished, we headed back to the backstage to see the next band. It was kind of weird because the singer looked like Ms. Callaway. XD Hehe. Their group was ok, but we once again went back to the main stage before the first song of this group was over.  After this, Interpol would play. I was so excited! My brother and I were just having a good time, laughing and making jokes. At 7.30, Interpol came up and the crowd cheered loudly. The first song they played was Obstacle 1, and I could hear that all the folks were singing along. They played all of the songs that I wanted to hear, except The New. But it still rocked! When they played Say Hello to the Angels, I wanted to faint. It was so awesome! I was in heaven. I  finally  got to hear one of my favorite bands live. Sooooo happy! Kick me! x_x  Their last song was PDA. Aw...so sad. They made a stop at the middle of the song, and I thought it was the end of it, but then they made a comeback and the crowd just became more loud. Time quickly passed by when Interpol was singing. They played like...three or four songs of their new album (which comes out on September 28), and they were great. So, the songs that I knew of that they played were: Obstacle 1, Stela was a diver, Say Hello to the Angels, PDA, NYC, and there was one more but I can't remember. x_x Whoa, if I got this excited for hearing one of my favorite bands, imagine how crazy I'd get if I'd hear The Cranberries: the best band out there! *faints*  There was gonna be another "great" band playing at the backstage, but my brother and I didn't bother to go there because there was "traffic." So we sat there for 50 minutes, and at 9.10 the lights went out. The people stood up and The Cure started to play.  The Cure was kick arse, but Interpol was even better. They played the Love Song, The End of the World, and some other songs that I don't know the name of but that I knew of. It was fun, and at 10.30 PM we had to get out because my dad was gonna come pick us up. As we were going outside, these girls were giving out some posters, stickers, and pins. One of the pins were of Interpol, so I of course grabbed some. At 11.30 we got home, and I was sooo tired. I tried to stay up late but I couldn't. Pfft, sucks.   Interpol and The Cure pwn.   But apart from that, school tomorrow. Gasp, so fast? I can't believe it. It doesn't feel like school starts tomorrow. I sent an e-mail to Mr. Williams about band and stuff on Friday, but I haven't gotten a reply. Gah, I hope I do so soon. >_
