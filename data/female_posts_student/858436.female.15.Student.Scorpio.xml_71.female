Emily, Kaci, Sara, Goodson, Squeeb, Matt, and Brett did too. Except Goodson didn't come back on the way home.. LOSER! Haha just kidding girl. Played the legendary Hat game again.. except this time the people were smart and figured it out easily, so it wasn't as good. Except Goodson, she didn't get it. Haaha.   Oh yes, there is something that I want to say. Shit has been going on at school with a friend of mine, and it is really stupid and unnecessary. I should have spoken up and stood up for her at one occassion, and I didn't. Next time, I will. I am not going to sit there and listen to people trash my friends about stuff that they obviously know nothing about. Half of the stuff said was bullshit! That is just something I am clearing up. If you are a friend to me in any way, you better believe that I will stick up for you when you are being trashed.  Just thought I'd let you all know that! Love ya!
