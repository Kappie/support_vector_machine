Earlier today, I strolled over to Gail's blog, Crossing the Rubicon, as I do every day, and I found  urlLink this entry from her  about Kerry's branding of the entire Republican party as "the most crooked, you know, lying group I've ever seen."  I quickly responded with a comment, the entirety of which may be found at the same link, wrapping up by saying "nice to know that Kerry is not so "nuanced" as to get caught up in the finer details of Republican character."    Later in the day, I opened my email to find  urlLink today's Best of the Web , where James Taranto writes in response to this statement by Kerry:  "John Kerry has finally said something that wasn't nuanced!"  We already knew James Taranto was brilliant and insightful.  Who knew I was as well?
