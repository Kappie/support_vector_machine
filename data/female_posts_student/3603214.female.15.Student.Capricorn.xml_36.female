The rest of us on stage just looked at each other like OMG what is she gonna do? So while he was setting up, Emily went behind him during her little improv part and was like HELLLOOOO! And we all just about died. Even the Bitch on Wheels was dying. Ryan had no clue that Emily made a move on him. He still doesn't know. Anyway, we had like a tiny convo w/ him. He has pretty eyes n he smells pretty...He even has a pretty voice lol. So yea...good times. Emily and I also snuck on stage for several scenes that we weren't supposed to be in. They didn't notice *yayness*. So we're movin on up. And I'm in like all of the second act. *major yayness* While singing backstage, Mike was talkin to us n he was like "U just got served!" n he started to do some dance moves so we we were like Break it down Jesus! Back that Jeez-ass up. Shake that Jeez-ass, Jeez-ass! So Emily is making Jeez-ass buttons for us. It's gonna have Mike's pic on it and we're gonna wear em on our asses...MAJOR good times....w/ Jeez-ass...hehe SEE! This is why everyone should be involved in theater!
