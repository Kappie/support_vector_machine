One thing, I have been told about digital cameras is the megapixels. The higher the megapixel, the better the picture quality.  Does it come in any other color besides baby blue?  The new MAC Workstations arrived in my store today.  I was so eager to set it up today.  Customers loved the sleek grey color.  Its too bad it doesnt come with a burner and a fire wire cable.  I wanted to convert the dv movies from Dot's video camera into avi's.  Gotta add that to my wish list this christmas.     More to come... NET
