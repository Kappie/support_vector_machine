I can't believe anyone would believe the kind of bologna (are you happy, Matt?) that Dan Brown writes about Catholics in particular and Christians in general.  Real, historical, orthodox Christianity just seems so much more convincing and intelligent!  But I guess people read it for the same reason I did: because someone else was talking about it.  And then they wonder, "Was that what all the fuss was about?"  Now Dad is planning a Sunday School talk on it, and I've been thinking about how I'd do the talk, if it were me.   Though most of the Christians I know won't be thrown into a crisis of faith by reading it, it's nice to have someone else spell out why, exactly, Brown's version of Christian history is hogwash.  I've just found the New Testament scholar  urlLink Ben Witherington's review for Biblical Archeology Review  and am pleased by its clarity and patience; and  urlLink Sandra Miesel's article  has some great criticisms from a Catholic angle.     I'm tempted to make more critical comments here, but will hold off for the moment.
