The step my sister calls the 'blind step.'  Oh boy!  For the  love  of socks! I never used to wear them. But I LOVE socks.   And now Im terribly bruising. If it swells! I may have to get a neck cast! It's absolutely unmovable. Tilting now like the leaning tower of Pisa?  heheh oawhhh man.  -- ouch! --
