Last night john came over to eat dinner with just my mom, yea my mom managed to send my brothers away and i went to his house to babysit while roberta worked. I made $40 in 3 hrs. YAY!! good money there. What i NEED to do is put that whole $40 in the bank, but i hate putting money in the bank. If i would just hand it to my grandfather and tell him bank please it would go to the bank and i wouldnt have to deal with it and wondering what to spend it on and then i'll have $40 when i get money outta the bank. And if i give it to my grandfather he usually doubles the amount and puts it in. So maybe he'll put $80 in there and then i'll have $80 instead of $40 just for putting money in the bank!! yay...but wait...i wanted to go shopping-who doesnt though? I wanted to go buy something. im addictied to just buying "things". My dad is coming to visit in exactly a week and he takes me shopping and get to buy all the clothes i want. So why should i waste my money on clothes this week?? hmm..i dont know. If i say to my mom "hey im gonna put $20 in the bank, so will u please buy this shirt for me?" i bet she'll buy it or whatever it is, just because im putting money in the bank. Now, the next $20 of that 40 i wanted to go tanning. I know i know...tanning...maybe a waste to some. But i've always wanted to tan and until recently my mom wouldn't let me. But, i want to tan and it takes $20 for 10 sessions. So, thats like $2 a session which is all good i guess. The first time i prob wont stay in there put 3-5 minutes, so for $2 i guess thats a lil less than an dollar a minute. Then again, i still havnt planned out mine and kaelas girl day. For christmas i was going to take her to get a french manicure (her fave) which is gonna cost me $15 and i was going to just get a regular manicure or my acrilylic nails done again (even though they hurt when u take them off and make ur real nails look and feel like shit, i think they're pretty), so for me im looking at anywhere from $10-30. I was then going to take her to a movie or something, which by the way i had passes for, but i used one of them. So now i'm looking at like $5 (we'd go in the afternoon). I'm sure my mom would supply the difference in all of that with my $40...and since im not babysitting as much these days i don't know when my next $$ will come in..haha sounds like a drug dealer. Oh well, i know what i'm going to do, take mom to the mall, have her buy me what i was going to buy with my money, put at least $10 in the bank and go tanning...more than likely. YUP. thats what im going to do.   Last nite i watched the movie Cabin Fever all by myself starting at about 12am. It's a movie about these teenagers who go up to this cabin after college finals to spend a week. And well..it's full of bloody nasty ass murders and crazy people. I figured it would be really scary like the man in the woods always jumping out with a knife. Naw, it's scary but not in that sense. You're on your toes about what you're going to see next. It didnt give me nightmares. :D lol BUT while i was watching it i did miss lorne. Here's why- he always like put his arms around me and held me ..and well, i like to be held. haha i like to cuddle. And in the movie theres always that couple and then another "should be" couple. I saw them and wanted that too. Buy hey, maybe it just wasnt lorne i wanted, maybe it was just a dude. That's prob it. Oh well.   Lately jordan has been talking nonstop about this amber chick from central. Shes a freshman and i've seen 2 pics of her and i've supposedly met her because she knows me. This is the 4rd girl he's liked since i've liked him. And the thing is, all 4 girls have liked him back, but things just didnt work out between them. In the time ive known jordan and even last year when i just knew of him, i've never seen a girl have a crush on him or him have a gf. But there i went, liking him. And as soon as i dont like him all these girls come after him!! haha well GO JORDAN! Naw, i'm happy for him and prob wouldnt date him if given the chance right now, but i miss that feeling. I want to have a crush on someone, i want to feel like jordan made me feel and i want to be all nervous like the first time lorne called me. UGH. lol I dont know what i want.
