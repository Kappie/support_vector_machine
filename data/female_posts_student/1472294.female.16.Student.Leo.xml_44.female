I was particulary scratching my head and hair (a few strands did came off *_*). Fortunately, paper 1 was okay. I was able to create a good story in my opinion, but I was short of time. Grrrr....  Oh, I just went out with my family to admiralty (the MRT stop before Woodlands) to have dinner. Actually, we planned to have our dinner at woodlands' causeway point.But my VERY SICK brother was unhappy and decided to have dinner at admiralty. Of course, my parents agreed and all we did was to have dinner and shopped at Popular for my brother's dictionary. In anger, I gobbled up a claypot chicken rice which was quite filling. *burp* And now where is my beloved and sick brother? Upstairs sleeping. Why? Because he had a temperature of 37.5. And my parents dared not sent him to a doctor as the doctor would surely sent him to Tan Tock Seng Hospital and take him as possible SARS case. (SCARY!!!) Served him right for going out and coming back late in the night (between 11 - 12am) AND playing computer games for the whole afternoon for about 6 hours and above. ^_^ Enough of my brother. Oh, I also hope to watch Channelnews asia about the FTA agreement between Bush and PM Goh. I really DO NOT hope they will lift off the ban for chewing gum. I hate chewing gums, I don't care about other countries say about us, as long as our country is still as clean and green as ever. (@_@)
