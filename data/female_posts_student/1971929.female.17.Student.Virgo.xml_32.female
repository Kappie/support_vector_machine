Tim and I went out for nearly eight months, starting in April of 2003, ending in December 2003. We broke up because I felt like we were only friends. He never seemed too interested and in the last couple of months he stopped asking me to do things with him. We pretty much only talked at school and he always seemed to have his mind on other things. So, it really seemed like there was no romantic interest, I mean, he never even kissed me; he never tried to kiss me. EIGHT MONTHS! Sheesh.
