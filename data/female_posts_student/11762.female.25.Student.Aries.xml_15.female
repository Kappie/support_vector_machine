Once more, I pay the price Of using my body To speak the language of liberation.   When did the faerie dust disappear? Did my mother Put Away My favorite doll?   I remember a simpler time, Before the Red Sea (with all its glorious might) Swept away my body Leaving my soul in her wake.   This is a moment That belongs to Every Woman.   A scare, A lunar flow unshed, A potential choice that devastates, And a false line that burns Bright pink.   Hope lies in a cardboard box.
