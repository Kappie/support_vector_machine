He is the most sweetest guy that I have meet in Tallahassee. I fought to tell you his name is Dwight or D.J. for short. We have been having so much fun this week, that I forgot all about all of the other guys that I meet and I want to be with him. We laugh about everything and the most important thing is that he is honest. I really need someone like that in my life. This weekend we are going to West Palm Beach, FL to visit my friend Zeanique because she got in a accident and he is going to visit my family. This is a big step for me because nobody has been home with me since  Anthony(me ex-boyfriend). So as you can imagine I am very scared. I hope that this is going to last because I want a boyfriend. But the really question is does he feel the same?
