       
      i'm about to do something that's either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid...actually, knowing me, it's probably a bit of both.  i'm finally going to send some poetry to journals, rather than just say i should.  it's a bit stress inducing, particularly since i just realized that i've formatted my submissions incorrectly for one of the journals.  i figure i can't back down if i post it publicly.  at least, i can't back down without looking like a wimp.
