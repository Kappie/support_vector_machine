These little guys are about the size of a printed W and are as fast as Marion Jones on steroids...or maybe I should just say...as fast as Marion Jones.    Then I will go out with Steve, a PhD student, to go collect adult sand and mud fiddler crabs to add to his cages.  He's doing a competition study between the two crab types, so he's adding them to cages, and seeing what happens.  However, before crabs can be added the resident crabs must be removed from the cage.  To make this go faster, we are using a wet-dry vac.  Basically, we are just sucking the crabs up and then dumping them into a bucket.  It's actually working pretty well...we haven't had any fatalities...well...not yet at least.  The picture shows that here at the Baruch Marine Field Laboratory, we are serious about cleaning up the environment.  It shows Steve vacuuming crabs.  You'd think they'd have a patch or a pill for that by now!  urlLink
