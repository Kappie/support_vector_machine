Stayed at Ami's last night, was fun, saw some very hot bloke at skaterham, which was nice, eyed him up for a good half an hour, yummy! Just chatted loads, i fell asleep thinking about Jason though, and just chilled today and been in the sunshine which has been nice, determind to get my belly button pierced and got Gemma's hen night tomorrow which should be a giggle, got a new black lacy top for it which i love! I been trying to block Jason etc etc all out of my mind, but its still lurking a bit...  ~Lisa~
