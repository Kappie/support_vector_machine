So, here are me and Georgia to give you all the gory details!  In the pool, there was the "Inflatable War". Lilos and inflatable dogs at the ready! Then, people got out and errr, got changed! hee hee, boys hold onto your boxers in future. One pair, namely Alex Murray's, got brutally savaged by the girls! They were pretty rankâ€¦  Hee hee, after a few drinks and some "quality circle time", all sat down to watch Scary Movie 2.. Great film. You gotta admit it. That finished and most people went home. However, my two girlfriends, Harri and Georgia, were staying the night and Murray's parents forgot about him, Rob and Mark. So they stayed for a bit too. Heehee, many silly hats were worn and many "stoned-looking" pictures taken, sooooo.... without further ado, I give you, The Motley Crue!      The pictures are all below
