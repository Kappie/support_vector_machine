And about 20 mins before Womder Woman returned home from work I actually took my shower. This very boring day made me come to the conclusion that living in the country Sucks. I have had no contact with any one other than Wonder Woman, and I'm going crazy. And this is only the first day. Augh! I did however get an interesting phone call this afternoon.  So I was on the internet craving human companionship, and the phone rings. I look on the caller Id and it says Camp Emaus. Now my little brother Max is at a canoe camp there. So the first though that enters my mind. What bone did he break this time? So I pick up the phone, and one of the counselors asks for my mom, and I informed her that both our parents left for vacation for a few days, but that I'm his sister, and maybe I can help. And she informs me that Max is getting homesick and wants to come home. Well he only has a day and a half of camp left, and he is 14. And I know that generally they try to get the kids to stick it out for the whole week. Now last year he had a really bad experience with camp. He was put in a really bad cabin, and ended up comng home early. So that probably had something to do with it, because he's never had a problem with homesickness before. So (now you may find this cauloused but remember I'm cold and soulless) I told her to have him stay, because we really didn't want to come pick him up.  That's all that happened today! How boring! I have to move somewhere where there are people. In a city even if you live alone there are tons of places you can go, just to have some human contact. You can run to the grocery store, rent a movie, browse the nearest target. Augh! But I'm stuck here for another year. We do get to go on a trip to the cities this summer though. And we are going to the museum!! I'll stop boring you for now. But have a wonderful day.
