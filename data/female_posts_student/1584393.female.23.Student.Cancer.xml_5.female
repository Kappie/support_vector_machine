I try not to envisage hurting people. I don't smile because that isn't really approachable, not when I've forced it anyway.  I didn't realise what I did until I walked into the bathroom on the way to class once. I walked in my usual self. I build up a wall around me. Not a wall to keep others out but a wall to hide me. I keep my head down and my face blank, or glaring at the ground. I stride, not walk. I keep my face turned away and my headphones on even when the battery has run flat.  I went in as me and came out as something else entirely. I came out with my belongings safely stored, my face clear of all emotion except a sunny sort of bewilderment. I stopped thinking of terrible lies, broken promises and dead oaths. I wandered and I sauntered and I skipped along to class.   These faces I wear are nothing like me, but are still of me.
