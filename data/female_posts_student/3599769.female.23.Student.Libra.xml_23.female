I make up things all the time. (words, songs, feelings) 4. I never thought I would be co-dependent.  5. But I am. 6. I'm afraid of going to fun places. Its weird. I always know of fun places to go, I like to do research on whats opening and whats new but I now rarely ever go. Refer to #4. 7. I don't have alot of girlfriends.  8. My apt. is a total mess.  9. I never ever take out the trash. 10. I don't feel comfortable around people, and sometimes not even myself.  11. I think everything that happens is a sign.  12. I'm starting to learn that they are just coinsidences. 13. I don't make enough money, but I'm not doing anything about it either. 14. I'm the oldest of 5 children, the youngest being 4. 15. If I really get to know you, I can prolly read everything about you. At least I have been able to in the past.  16. I'm extremely selfish, unless I love you.  17. I compromise too much.  18. I'm in love, and don't want to be anymore. 19. I feel like my "real life" should have started already. 20. It hasn't started cause I have that mentality most likely.  21. I feel like a stranger.  22. I'm afraid to make decisions. Any kind.  23. I hate CHANGE.  24. I'm obessive-compulsive. 25. I need to figure out what is going to make me happy.  26. This last year has been the worst in my life.  27. I wish I had a dog. 28. I thought I knew what I was doing, only to find out I've been lying to myself all along.  29. I cry all the time.  30. I used to laugh all the time.  31. I'm a shell of what I used to be.  32. I wish/pray goodness on everyone. 33. I have massive anxiety attacks.  34. I'm constantly paranoid.  35. I don't do drugs. 36. But I smoke.  37. I like to drink, but always feel so guilty the next morning.  38. I want to start all over again.  39. I don't do any work all day, and my desk is a mess.  40. I used to be the "lucky" one. 41. It took me moving out at 18 for me and mom to really have a relationship. 42. I will never move back home.  43. I give advice, but never seem to take it. But I greatly appreciate it.  44. I wish more people would visit my blog and comment.  45. I wish I would have went away to college. 46. I need to wash my car. 47. I'm on the road to recovery. A long road.  48. I haven't had that "excited" feeling in my stomach about anything in about a year. 49.I whine too much. 50. Sometimes I think about dying. But I'm seriously not suicidal. Does that make sense?
