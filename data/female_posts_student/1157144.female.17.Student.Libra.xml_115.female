Billy, i'm gone this weekend, in fact, i need to be home by 10 on friday. i have a race down in hollister saturday morning, then i head to Tahoe. and yes, UC Davis really is just to get out of school...why do you think we chose Davis and not Berkely? we get a charter bus and insurance that everyone misses 8th period (that was before they got rid of all 8th periods)
