Part of it is because I got the first decent bit of emotional honesty (breakthrough of the decade, ladies and gents) from boy and the other part is that I had a restful - albeit short - sleep. I hope that sentence made sense. Because I just cannot edit this afternoon.   Karaoke News . No, dearies, I did not sing "Eye of the Tiger" last night. But I did sing a killer " urlLink Jessie's Girl ". It killed (perhaps I am overstating this, for I was in a room full of strippers/indie sophisticates) for the following reason: I know a lot - maybe too much -  urlLink about Rick Springfield  and inserted tidbits about SoapOperaHeartthrob MD during the gratuitous guitar solos.  Here are some of the bits:  1. His name is really Richard Springthorpe. Is Springthorpe not sexy enough for you Hollywood? Huh? 2. He is Australian (sorry, Joanne!) 3. He was on  urlLink General Hospital . Sizzle. Ouch, so hot. 4. He broke his arm on tour (yes, he is  urlLink ON TOUR ). The fifty-something imagined himself a young rockstar and fell off his little rockstar harness.  Later note:  I've just found out that although charges were dropped due to insufficient evidence, RS was arrested for  urlLink spousal abuse  a few years ago. That just unsexies him, doesn't it?
