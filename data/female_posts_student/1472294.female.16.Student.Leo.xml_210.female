(-_-) Anyway, juz update my blog here and introduce all of you to Domuya. Singapore's own Super Dollfie website, shop and forum. *YES!!!* I am so elated! Finally, Singapore had set up a shop that sells SD DOLLS! ^__^ Check out their website ---> http://www.domuya.com and join their forum! Will update more in a few weeks time. Be patient with me coz I will be very free after november for three months... (0^-^0)
