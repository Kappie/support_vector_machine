Dear Heather:  I don't know if you remember this, but I have a clear first memory of you in this class that involved signing up for authors. That morning I believe you and many others were here rather early, hoping to get a particular author. When I came and opened the door, there was a mad rush to find the sign-up sheets. I remember one individual holding a pen and ready to write his or her name next to an author and then distinctly hearing your voice say, "Excuse me, but I was here before you and that's my author." I admired that spunk and character you possessed and weren't afraid to show!  All throughout this year you've known what you've wanted and have applied yourself to getting it in a quiet and steadfast manner. Thank you for letting me be a part of your high school career. I wish you a wonderful summer!  Sincerely, Mrs. Chiu   Hahahahaha. That one gave me a good laugh.  Oh by the way-- school is out. :)
