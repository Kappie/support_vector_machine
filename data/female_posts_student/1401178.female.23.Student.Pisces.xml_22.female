What's next? Fantasia? If she ever get voted-off, my American Idol-watching-routine is gone baby! No more American Idol in this house. I can't believe that two of the 'alright' singers stay on the competition. Because of what? Are they good singers? Not as good as those three (Jen, George, LaToya)! Are they good looking? Well, surely people think so seeing the way they stay. For your information...it's a singing competition, not a popularity contest. This is turning to be the ugliest season ever. Even Ryan Seacrest doesn't worth it if Fantasia got booted.  When Jennifer was voted off, I stayed on. When George Huff was voted off, I shruged off the possibility of stop watching. I will stay watching until it turns to the ugliest possibility ever...that two 'alright' singer is going to fight for the top position and it's runner up. If that happens, that's it. Might as well rename the show into something like American something.  Wait, I have take care of my zit first. Damn these hormons.  Okay, back. Got a cotton with alcohol on it. Hurt a little, but the price to be beautiful. Hwahahahaha. I can't believe I've said that.  All of this mess wouldn't have happen if...I could vote. Being geographical impossible to vote get to my nerve. I'll pay good amount of money if only I can vote. *sigh* Me feel bad. Me feel a piece of cookies coming right into my mouth this any minute. Wait...okay, I still can eat something. Cut-off time is 8 pm. I'm off...to get my cookie.
