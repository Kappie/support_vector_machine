I never thought them as wrong, but sometime ago, I just kept listening to those around me(more than usual) and some of them are against it.  They say that it is wrong to read Harry Potter.  It will corrupt my mind as my grandmother tells me.  I don't understand.  If you know that the book is not true, and you know that none of it could be real, then what is the problem?  I like the imagination of the people who write these books.  I never would have thought to think up this kind of stuff.  I have a pretty out there imagination too.  I don't exactly understand.  Maybe their parents were the same way and they just drilled it into their kids' mind.  I don't understand why they would do it though.  I would be happy if my kid were just plain reading.  I believe that if you talk to your child and they understand that it is not real, then you should let them read it.  I mean, I just don't really get it.  I understand that that is what some people believe, but is that the right way?   Am I wrong for reading those books?  What is right when it comes to these kinds of books?  What's wrong?
