I'm going to England + Scotland + Paris for a little over two weeks, then I'm home for a day, then I go to running camp(like I'll still be in shape for that after not running on the trip. great.) and then I'm at Great Gorge for a little and then school starts - I'm excited but I'm more annoyed right now. This history paper is just JUNK.
