What sucks is knowing that maybe if you tried a little harder, talked a little bit more, you could have a chance with him. It sucks.  Guess how long I've liked him? Since  September . How pathetic is that? I've liked him for almost 4 months and nothing at all has happened. I've liked him for a third of a year. Geeze.   Can't get a ride to Cape tonight... so pissed. I can't WAIT until I can freaking DRIVE MYSELF UP THERE WHENEVER I WANT!  "Doesn't it just make you want to give him a hug?" Haha... don't step on it!!  Silence. Mhm. No more conversation.  Gonna go start working on my poetry project.. SINCE SIKESTON IS GAY AND CAN'T GET A SOCIAL LIFE AND GO TO THE GAME AND GIVE ME A RIDE!!!!
