Mood: waiting 
   ___What happens when you run away with nothing but a life within you? And your father died, and your mom’s a drug addict, who just happened to get out of rehab? Would you run away and be spotted last weekend? And also have a detective on your case? Well that’s what one of our former friends decided to do on May 2 of this year. Melissa found her missing profile on the internet… and I guess it was foreseen that this was bound to happen for all she’s been through. She came over and we tried to call the agency but it was being  soo f,cking shitty . I mean a person could have been killed form the speed their servers work at  !!   Then went back onto the internet to look for other missing children agencies, and she appeared yet another site. We called in to that detective and at first he thought we had her tied down and ready to be taken to the police, but then we said that we only had an updated picture of her, so we could help their searches. I made Melissa talk… I was too scared to talk. We finished the phone call, and the detective might even call me for questioning…  scary . Jordan wasn’t all that great of a friend, but I still owe her for lying to her… so this is how I’m going to help her. I wonder when she’ll finally find a family that will love her and turn her back into the normal Jordan, without the drugs, sex, boyfriends, and family shit. God please bless the common sense she needs to hold on strong, and get through all this. I want to see the friends that I’ve had to become great people, not one who regrets ruining her life.
