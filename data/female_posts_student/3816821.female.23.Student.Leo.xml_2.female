Northampton is moving from a three tier education system ( lower, middle and upper schools ) to a two tier system ( primary and secondary ).  I left school about 5 years ago now - I stayed on at my upper school for my A-Levels. But even though it has beenquite awhile, I still feel a bit sad to hear of the closing of many of the local schools. My old upper school - Thomas Becket - is now to become a secondary, and therefore is taking on approximately 400 extra pupils. My old middle school - St Mary's - is closing for good, and there will be development on the site to turn it into a primary school. I can't say I am confident that this change will do any good for the standard of education within Northampton. I remember teachers already stretched to their limits, and doing their best with the few resources that were made available to them. I cannot see how crowding hundreds more pupils in to a school will improve their education.  I hope that this change will work out for the best, but I really don't see how forcing teachers to try to teach both fairly young children - 11/12 year oldsat the start of secondary school -all the way to young adults taking A-Levels, will improve teaching standards. At least before these changesteachers were focused on a particular age group, and therefore able to prepare those pupils better for exams and such like, and teach them in a consistantly good manner. I might not have shown it at the time but I did appreciate my education and all the teachers ever did for me. It was a great atmosphere between pupils and teachers, many of the teachers still have a fond place in many of our hearts. I hope that by adding 400 plus pupils to the school does not remove this aspect of Thomas Becket for future generations. Itseems clear to me that this is just a way for Northampton Council to save money on the costs of schools, whilst not really bothering about what the children will learn, how they will be affected, or how the teachers within the schools will take the changes either. Even so, I wonder how much money that could be better spent on improving facilities will be instead used to rapidly upgrade the capacity of the schools. It feels like a waste to me. Maybe I'm just going to miss the fact that I won't be able to drive past St Mary's Middle and think back to all the good times there ( or the bad times ). I think I'm just getting sentimental that things are changing.  So, I will finish this post by saying goodbye to St Mary's Middle School, and good luck to Thomas Becket in it's new role as a secondary. If anyone else has any opinions on this, or stories to share, then please feel free. I'd love to hear what current teachers and pupils think of all the changes. Just add a comment and let me know.
