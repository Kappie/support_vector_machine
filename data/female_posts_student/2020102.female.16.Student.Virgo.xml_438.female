All I'm doing now is quotes, because I have like a ton.   "This is already fun and we haven't even left church!" -Austin the morning we left, right after we got on the bus to the airport and there were like a billion moths inside that were attacking Brittany and me  "If you crash into something, stop the car." -Ernesto  "Hey you stupid redhead, I'm gonna beat you next time. Not only do I have to protect her physically but emotionally too? Don't make my wings grow fists." -Derek to Opie, who was being Brittany's MSN Butterfly and protecting her from bad stuff like they do on the commercials  (driving around Belen) Ken: Anybody want to buy some pencils? Derek: What? No gracias. Ken: There's a kid on the corner and he's selling pencils and he has to sell fifty so he can buy food to eat tonight. Derek: Oh... really? Ken: I don't know, maybe. Derek: Why you gotta make crap up and make me feel bad.  Sara: (after he did something weird) Who ARE you, Stevo? Stevo: I'm good!  "Go long! Really long, like 4 blocks long. I CAN throw that far, trust me. I AM the next John Elway!" -Derek to Brittany when she wanted the football  Sara: Don't laugh at me! Why are you laughing at me? Kenneth: I want to.  Me: What is in your backpack, Ross? Ross: Your mom. Me: Oh, right. Sara: What's in there?  Me: My mom, apparently.  "I think I'm having an out of body experience." -Connor randomly during debrief  "It's crazy... everything is so slow and laid back... until they start driving." -Ken  (In Costa Rica, everybody is late to everything and it's no big deal but they all drive like maniacs)  Ashley: Your mom. Minor: Why my mom? My mom is not here.  (sort of late at night, someone takes a picture and it has a bright flash) Derek: Geez, WARN us when you're gonna tell us you're gonna take a picture- Kyle: Warn us when you're gonna tell us? "Hey. I'm about to tell you something."  "My Tico family was pretty nice... except the grandma, who poured boiling water all over me." -Ross  "I'm one of the smart people who opened their eyes under water in the ocean. 'Let's see what the ocean looks like! Oh! It looks like burning!'" -Austin  (At lunch in Punta Leona, the beach resort place we went to, there was a leaf that was a decoration on Sara's dessert.) Connor: (picks up leaf) This is one of those edible leaves. Sara: No it's not, it's just a plain leaf. Connor: No, it's edible. (conversation shifts for a while until) Connor: It's kind of sugary. (is holding the leaf and there's a piece missing from it) Sara: Really? (grabs leaf and takes a bite out of it) It is kind of sugary. (big pause where everyone stares at her) Sara: Now he's going to hold up the piece of the leaf and tell me he didn't really eat it. Connor: (holds up the piece of the leaf) I didn't really eat it.  (at the retreat) Me: Where'd your stalkers go? Austin: I don't know, maybe they went to bed. Sara: No, they're in their room, primping in front of the mirror. Me: Ooh, they're getting ready to come and talk to you again. Austin: I love how you're enjoying this so much.  Connor: I have (something unintelligible) Austin: What? Connor: Hiccups. Austin: Oh, I thought he said hippos. I was like oh... okay... I hope you enjoy them...  "One time my brother got pissed at me because I broke his wrist on purpose." -Austin  "You act like your plate is a bunch of problems." -Austin to me when I had the last plate of rice and beans I will ever eat  "I brought like nine or ten pairs of shirts..." -Austin  Sara: Why you gotta be racist, Kyle? Kyle: I'm not racist, I have a color TV.  Sara: Don't ever do that again. Kyle: Don't ever try to make me feel like I'm stupid.  "I hate the question 'do they have the 4th of July in England?' Yes, it comes after the third and before the fifth." -Austin  "I love how it's pressurized for our comfort and not for the fact that if it wasn't pressurized we'd all probably die." -Austin during the saftey video on the plane ride back
