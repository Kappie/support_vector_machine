Linds, Abby, and I won't be here to drown your boredom in so please please please don't jump off the roof and don't set yourself on fire. Will and Zabeht, we're meeting sometime after the 25th (that's a friday) at night for a couple of hours to figure out what the essays are saying and what we're supposed to say in the essays. Will, I think you have the wrong copy of Aristotle. It's supposed to be THe Rhetoric and The Poetics of Aristotle not the Art of Rhetoric. You can find the right version at BN.com, it's got a green cover and it's like $9. enjoy! Everyone keep safe please please please. If you absolutely need me or something has happened (like Josh just died) call Zabeth for my number, she has it. Zabeth, I'm counting on you to make sure Jaoh isn't dying.  Luv you all -Rosie
