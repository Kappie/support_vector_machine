Today we hosted the Florida State Association of Teen Courts meeting and Jason neglected to tell me that he had moved the meeting up (grumble, grumble) so people had already started showing up with I strolled into the office thinking I would have time to grab coffee and check my email before everyone arrived.  Found out that Orange County Teen Court is basically desperate for employees (the letter is going out in the morning mail.)  I think I'm literally the youngest person to ever have a Teen Court job and the old bats that run the majority of the programs definitely look at me as a young kid who doesn't know what she's talking about for the most part.  I smiled, and kept my mouth shut and was just happy to be hopefully leaving the state sometime in the very near future.  I got a job phone call today from someone in a juvenile treatment facility in Southeast Pennsylvania: 2.5 hours from Washington, D.C.  Hopefully she'll call me back on Friday when I'm at home not eating or doing much of anything (ahh...Catholicism at it's finest.)  I wanted to give my notice today (or at least this week) to make sure that Jason had enough time to hire someone else before I leave at the end of July, but my father called me frantic when my mother told him.  He thinks that I will get fired if I tell them now that I'm leaving in 4 months.  I doubt it.  It will take them at least 4 months to find someone decent to replace me and then they've gotta hire someone part time on top of that!  I really want to make sure that the program will be left in good hands when I leave because it is way too big for anyone to run by himself.  It's way too big for only 2 people...  Incidentally apparently the Orange County Teen Court program has a 1.2 MILLION dollar budget!!  What is THAT about?  We had the smallest budget by far of any program at the meeting today, but I bet none of them have their masters and are making 20 grand a year.  Sheesh.  What the hell was I thinking?  Oh, that's right...that I was poor...way to get myself out of THAT situation!!  But the good news is that the garage sale stuff is going fast!  Get your butt to  urlLink The Sale   and check it out before you miss your chance.  This was literally the best idea I've had in a while...I highly recommend you host an internet garage sale if you want to sell your crap.  People will literally fight over a breadmaker...it's kinda funny  Tomorrow I get to present what I have gleaned as an adolescent counselor to the people that are in my Master's Program now.  (one word for you, kids: Sedatives)
