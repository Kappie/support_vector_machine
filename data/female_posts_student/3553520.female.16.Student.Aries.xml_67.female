[un]kept promises.  --> [un]finished lives.  + + + + +  blank pages and empty lines make me wonder if this life is worth living pour your heart into broken love for nothing   no one stops [for you] no one notices [you]   no one cares [about you] this is all a waste of time  + + + + +  I shouldnt be allowed to write pointless things in the middle of the night.  It only leads to confusion in the morning.  Just let me sleep. Get out of my head. Out of my dreams.  Just let me get some rest.
