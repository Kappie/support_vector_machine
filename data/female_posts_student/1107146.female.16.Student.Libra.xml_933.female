Anyway, is there a "no conflict" rule on this Blog like on Josh's because I want to know in advance if I can rip throats out verbally or if I will have to do it physically.  Just in case I have to and there is no other recourse for my oh-so-fragile sanity.  I think I might have my first one in mind.    Anyhow, gotta go and I will talk to you people later.  ~Z
