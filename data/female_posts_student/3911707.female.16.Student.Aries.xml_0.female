It could always be that I want to cry, but I'm not. Last night I cleaned my room and threw out over 20 cans of Mountain Dew. Not even a full day later, there's 3 cans already sitting here. What does that say to you? I'm a loser. I sit at my computer and drink Mountain Dew. Okay, I'm not a complete loser. I have a life, but as soon as I come home... I'm just a lazy S.O.B. Last night was amazing. Pat and I have always had a rough relationship, mostly the last few months. Do you know how good it felt to be able to be around him without fighting over something or talking about "us"? Okay, well, it was weird, but yet relaxing. I had a smile on my face that wouldn't go away. He even called me after he got home to talk (as if I didn't just spend the last few hours with him). Why can't we get along like that everyday? Today was a complete waste of time. Shana needed to be kidnapped because her house was driving her nuts, and this town is pointless, so we took a nice little trip to BD. I told my cousin, Michelle, that we might stop over and she somehow convinced me to pick up her little friend Nick. What, Nick doesn't have legs and can't get his ass over to her house? Whatever, I did it anyways. I pulled up in my ghetto green van into the back parking lot of my dad's business. Fast-forward to us heading towards Michelle's house. I lit up a cigarette and not 5 seconds later he asked to bum one from me. Dude, you're younger from me and I don't like being an influence to people. Smoking was my decision and I don't support it. Not only that, but I DON'T KNOW YOU. Being the sweetheart I am, I said yeah, but told him not to bother asking again, I'm not made of money (you can say that again, I am so broke that the most I ever put in my van at a time is less than 10 dollars). Sooner or later, I went to Wal-mart. I love Wal-mart. It's so simple and cheap. I got two tank-tops for around $7. You better believe I love it. After hanging out with a few friends, I came home with a message from Pat waiting for me. It said something along the line of, "I'm going to bed earlier than normal because I'm tired as all hell from work, plus, I wouldn't want to bother you when you're with small one." Okay, so his grammar was probably about 50 times worse, but you get the point. Yeah, it was sweet that he was thinking about me, but don't give me that "I have to work" shit. Suck it up buddy. "You can take that J-O-B and shove it up your anus." -Tech N9ne.
