I just wanted something real...   Wanting is human nature.  It's primal.  We all want.    I want to dance.  I want to go crazy.  I want to  feel.   And I want you.  I'm singing for you, love, even though you can't hear me.  This day makes me realize how quickly things change.  A few words can send everything spiralling...     out of control   I want it to end.  [again it comes down to wanting.]  I want a new beginning and a reason to smile.  And I guess you'll find me when you want to...  Let's just hope you don't get lost too.   "I'm you and me, and a whole lot more and I'm here and I'm near. I can see you but you won't see me and there's a reason for this song... It's cuz everything I thought about love everything I thought about love everything I thought about love is wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong..."
