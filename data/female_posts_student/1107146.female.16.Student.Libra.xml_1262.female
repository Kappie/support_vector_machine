How can you get mad at Maddie?  It's like getting mad at Josh...it just doesn't happen!  Everything I say is wrong and stupid and I'm always getting on her nerves unless she needs me to do something.  God, I do NOT want to see this child as a teenager.  I'm starting to be very glad that I'll be leaving home in a couple of years so I won't have to deal with all this brattiness anymore.  I know part of it is my fault for spoiling her when she was little, but this is way over the whole "I-want-it-give-it-to-me" brattiness.  It's the "I'm-better-than-you-and-I know-more-than-you-do-unless-I need-you-to-do-something-for-me-then-I'll-be-really-sweet" type brattiness.  That is one of those things that just gets on my nerves to no end.  NO one is better than I am, except for maybe Abby or Adam, and of course my grandmother, who's just practically better than everyone else on this planet.  But that's not the point.  She isn't a saint or a God, she's an eleven year old little girl who hasn't the decency to keep her mouth shut when she needs to.  I love the kid to death, and there is no way I'd ever start a fight over this, but I really needed to get that out so I won't scream at her.  Liz, don't you wish you had siblings?
