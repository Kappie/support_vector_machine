I usually hate blogs that are just "So this weekend I....", but it's all I really have to write at the moment.  So this weekend, I had fun.  After school Friday, my neighbors gave me two tickets to the WBCN River Rave. They were looking for someone to give them to because they won the tickets and weren't planning on going. They were box seats. I wasn't complaining. I need to bake some cookies for my neighbors or something...that was too cool of them. Then my mom took me to the mall to buy presents for my friend Erin and my friend Nina. Then I went to Erin's house for her birthday party. It was really cool, cause she's homeschooled, so she dosn't go to my school. Obviously. So she had a bunch of very different friends from many different places, and I didn't know any of them. I loved it. I met a whole group of new people, and thye were all really great kids that I'm glad to know. I'm also really happy for Erin, I think she enjoyed the party a lot. So, I spent the night there, and went home early Saturday morning to start getting ready for my friend Nina's sweet 15.  She's Mexican, so instead of a sweet 16, they ahve a sweet 15, and it's s big deal. It was a formal party, and she had a group of friends who were kind of her bridesmaids of the occasion. I was one of 'em. SO...Afetr I took a shower and stuff, I went over to Joyce's house and we got our hair done. Then we stopped by my house to pick up our dresses and stuff, and went down to Nina's house. We got dressed and took pictures, then took a limo over to the party. We did this big enterance thing, where we all came in in couples, lined up, and held roses over Nina as she walked in with her "guy". Then we gave Nina her roses, and sat down at our special little table. In came the Mariachis. Those guys were so cool. That's what I wanna do when I grow up. They sang to her, and she cried, and they kept singing, and then they went onstage and sang some more. She had her dad change her shoes in this big chair thing, from slippers to silver heels, to symbolize her growing up. Then we ate and danced. At 10:00 we, her special friends, did the waltz. It was cool, even though the DJ messed up the song at the end, nobody could really tell. Then we sang to her and she cut the cake, and we ate more, and danced more, and everyone went home at about midnight. We cleaned up and got to her house by 1:00, then hung out there while she opened presents and watched a movie and listened to her parents' friends play guitar and sing in spanish in the kitchen. I loved it. I'm so happy for Nina, cause she spent such a long time planning the party, and I think it kicked ass.  We got to sleep at about 5:00 AM, then woke up at 9:30 cause Joyce and Devan and Jorge and his friend Jose had to go home. Then Shaina left, then Nina and I slept for a couple more hours. Then we walked to Burger King, then ate, then slept. Then slept. Then we got ready and drove down to Mansfield to go to the River Rave. One of my presents to her was one of the tickets. We were a couple hours late, but we still got there in time to see most of the good bands. Box seats are so cool. It's VIP, so they were really good seats, and we had our own   little waitress lady come around to take our order. We ordered drinks and a pizza and a smoothie. Fun stuff. Bands? The Darkness was AMAZING, as well as The Offspring, who was headlining. Dashboard Confessional had good music, but, performance-wise they fell a little short. New Found Glory was fun. P.O.D. Kicked A-S-S. I honestly wasn't expecting them to be that good, but they were. AMAZING performance. Wow. Then we waited in the parking lot getting hit on by drunken boys and watching people set off fireworks for an hour until my mom came to pick us up. Let me just tell you, I love drunk boys at rock concerts. They are SO funny. Then we drove back to my house, and fell asleep in our clothes 'till 10:00, when my mom woke up up to go upstairs cause she had someone coming over, and we were drooling on the couch. We went up to my room and slept until 2:00PM. Then Nina went home.  There you have it; my Memorial Day weekend.
