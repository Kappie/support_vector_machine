The fire place in the sitting room was torn from the wall, and the fire extinguishers were all emptied, and they stole the kitchen table. On top of that there is an outstanding electric bill that I refuse to pay. I am exasperated to say the least, and that mixed with home sickness just makes me want to jump on a plane tomorrow and go home. I know in Helena I would have a job that would allow me to save my money, and here I am always broke. I am supposed to go to Galway next weekend, but have no clue how I will ever get the money for it since my hours have been reduced at the bar. I know I am wining but I can't help it, I am so frustrated. Just when things start to look good some big dark cloud comes and makes them seem so impossible. I know money isn't everything, and that I have never been let down, but things just seem so hard right now. I will quit sulking now.  Oh yeah...Anthony who are you? Do I know you?
