I got up and showered and then headed over to Chelsmes and thats where Ben met us too and her mom took us and Ashley to Hawaiian Falls and it was only me and Bens first time there so it was so fun! We were there from like 12:30 to 4:30 or maybe later and then we had to go because Chelsy had to babysit. And on the way home Ben fell asleep...awwww we took a picture of it on his phone and it is soo cute but we know he will probably erase it. :'(  So when we got back to Chelsys we first did Bens hair which looked very interesting because we did like corn rows with butterfly clips lol hewas pimpin! haha jk and then Chelsy and him played a little but of pool and then we had to leave so she could go and babysit.  Ben and me just went back to my house and sat around for like and hour or so because my mom decided to go to the gym and i couldnt like get a hold of her so we just like watched tv till she got home. Then when she finally did get home we had some dinner...PIZZA and brownies!! (and Ben i didnt burn it that bad ok!! I cant help that my oven is a little too hott!) and looked at my Hawaii pictures and stuff. And Mitchy my little bro bro wouldnt leave us alone. it was so funny because he was soo bored and had noting to do so my mom gave him chores haha.  Then weleft and saw Harold and Kumar (Kum haha)go to Whitecastle with Bens friends Bryce and Anthony. (Maegan, me and Ben promise we will go with you again so you can use him to get into the movie lol) And it was a pretty good movie it had some really funny parts. We then left and Bryce wanted to race Ben and that was pretty funny lol Bens (racecar haha Chelsy) car against Bryces truck. and then he just took me home and it was another end of like a perfect night!  I now understand why I had to move to Texas!!   Ill talk to you guys later...   i love you  heather
