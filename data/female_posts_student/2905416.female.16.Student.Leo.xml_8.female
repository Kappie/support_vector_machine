For example; I have recently been obsessing about this one particular subject, which I don't need to mention, and it has driven me so far up the wall that I am on the ceiling. And, contrary to popular belief, the ceiling is not a comfortable place; a bit to upside-down for my liking. So, anyway, I have decided to stop thinking. Full stop. It just does not work for me, and I don't like it at all. Goodbye thinking!  Another thing I'd like to mention is that it is holidays now, and, as usual, I am as bored as hell. Yup, oh soo bored! Holidays seem to do that to me, even though at the start of everyone I vow to make them interesting...Unfrotunatly this never works. So, I have come to another conclusion (yes, that's right, two in one night!) that I am not ment to have a stimulating life. I suffer from Chronic Boredom (diagnosed myself) and can not seem to get around this gay thing that is boredom. It shits me constantly. Everyone else has such fun, or at least interesting, lives, but mine is like a sack full of cocks. A cockhead of a life, thats it!   Meh, I spose I can get over it. I get over everything else (just as I am getting over the thing I mentioned above) and will get over this too. This, I suppose, will involve effort (poo) but I spose if it's what I must do, then I will.  What'll come will come and we have to meet it when it does...I spose...*sigh*   Can you  hear  my eyes rolling?
