I was also thinking that to ants we are giants, but if they cant see us that means that they dont know that we are here, so maybe we are ants to something else. Maybe they look down on us like we look down on ants. Maybe they see us scurring about on our day to day business and tease us like we tease ants, maybe thats what is happening when it rains - they are pouring water on us to get rid of us, because they see us a pests, they are trying to drown us, like we try and destroy the ants nest! Maybe just maybe???!!!!!!  Yes so anyway...........................im going now....  Much Love to you all xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
