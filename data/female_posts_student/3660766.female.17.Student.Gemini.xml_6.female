I couldn't go onBut now I've found I'm feeling strong and moving onI believe they can take anything from meBut they can't succeed in taking my inner peaceThey can say all they wanna say about meBut I'm gonna carry onI'm gonna keep on singing my songWhoa, everytime I tried to be what they wanted from meIt never came naturallySo I ended up in misery, wasn't able to seeAll the good around meThey wasted so much energy on what they thought of meSimply just remembering to breatheI'm human, I ain't able to pleaseEveryone at the same time, so now I findMy peace of mind living one day at a timeI'm human and I answer to one godIt comes down to one loveUntil I get to heave aboveI've made the decisionNever to give upTil the I day I die no matter whatI'm gonna carry on keep on singing my song...(They can't take anything from me)I believe that they can do what they wanna.Say what they wanna say(They can say what they wanna)But I'm gonna keep on(Keep on )I believe itThat they can take from meBut they can't take my inner peaceOh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,Say what you wanan say, but I'm gonna sing my songOh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
