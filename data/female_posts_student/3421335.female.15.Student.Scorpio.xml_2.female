Maybe I'd do better on my own No one ever seems to understand me It's easier for me to be alone There's still a piece of me that feels so empty  I've been all over the world I've seen a million different places Back through the crowds and all the faces I'm still out there looking for you  Where are you now? I'm trying to get by with never knowing at all What is the chance of finding you out there? Do I have to wait forever?  I write about the things I'll never know I can find a moment just to a slow down It makes me think I'll never have the chance To figure out… what it's all about So tell me… what it's all about… 'cause  Where are you now? I'm trying to get by with never knowing at all What is the chance of finding you out there? Do I have to wait forever? Where are you now? I'm trying to get by with never ever knowing at all And I still don't know  Where are you now? I'm trying to get by with never ever knowing at all What is the chance? Of finding you out there  Do I have to wait, do I have to wait, do I have to wait forever?     Where are You now? by Michelle Branch
