BUT i know i'm definitely not going back to the root of DRAMAs. i need some space to breathe. saw alot of new faces in our lecture group. some ppl changed eh~~~as in physical appearance. not really nice though. hmmm...my gang laughed at me~~~~they said tamagotchi's for KIDS. but mine's really CUTE!   i hate queueing up...so tiring. $30.10 gone...thanks to the modules' notes. sighs. those pig guys in my gang kept ogling at GIRLS. gee. guys ah...grrr. hmmm...dunno wad else to write. oh ya...was painting my nails just now. added some art to it. haha. nail art. i love it! lol.   erm erm...really dunno wad to write. oh, so sweet of my hubby to carry my heavy notes around. lol. thanks thanks. oh ya! stupid zhiwei kept teasing me since the moment we met this morning! argh. *kick* hmmm...looking forward to a date with SOMEONE(an idiotic pig who makes me hate and love him) this friday! lol. he's gonna buy me a pair of shoes. so happy!   [anyhow...i dunno if i am with him or not...i dunno if i still want to or not. i noe i need a special someone to lean on, but i dun trust anyone anymore...sighs. i dun see the future in us. i am realistic and i have to be. LOVE is not everything...we need many other more factors to survive in this world, esp. in Singapore! i do have feelings for him...and it's alot. but i dunno if it's still LOVE. i'm so lost. it's either i choose LOVE and might have to suffer in the future OR i choose the FUTURE and dun have love. life is always so full of choices and we have to make so many decisions. even when we dun wanna think about the problems, we're forced to face it and make a really difficult decision. FLY AWAY~ that's wad many ppl yearn for...i believe. i'm not being a desperado...i dun yearn for LOVE, i noe it'll come my way when the time comes. BUT sometimes...i wish it'll come by sooner...cos it's really tiring walking this journey alone...sighs. still, a wish is just a wish...]  good nite and sweetest dreams to all... peace.
