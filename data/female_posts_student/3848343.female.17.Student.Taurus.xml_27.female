Jenny then called me and I was teller her about the fucker ho called me in the wee hours of the morning only to find out it was her by accident cause she didnt lock her phone properly and well it went to msg bank so she wasted her credit...poor kid LOL. That conversation went for over and hour and half because STUPID ME taught the lil girl (jen) that if she calls me, even if I hang up, she will still be on the phone so if I go and pick up the phone she will still be there....THE WORST thing I ever taught her because she sticks around like chewing gum on the bottom of ur shoe!  We got off the phone and she was trying to make me do some home work so I looked at it, thought for a while and then realised that was enough work done for one day so I watched tv and my sister made me some popcorn. well the rest of the day was spent chatting online untill I had to walk over to my dads to mind my lil sister (who will later be referred to as 'lil SHIT') anyway on the way I met lewis and continued my walk....I made dinner and went back online and then my sister came home and I had to take care of her but the lil shit doesn't stop running around..shes like the energizer bunny I swear!  Well yeh while she was being all energetic I was trying to organise the movies for tomorrow night but that feel through so I decided I would just work again...im sure I will still have fun...I get to work with VELVET :>....And my other sis but she just does what I say hahahaha...well to keep the story rolling, I put my sister to bed after watching an episode of gummy bears and reading her a book then I went and watched ORIGIN!!....it was the maddest....Charles tried to tell me that QLD would come back after half time and that NSW could eat shit....but the only dung beetles I saw around were the queenslanders as at full time it was 36 - 14...thats right Charles EAT SHIT QUEENSLAND! anyway I was in a good mood after that win so yeh I talked more on the net and then thought I would hit the sack b4 my mood was ruined hahaha so I went to bed...thats where yesterday ended and today began....so basically as u can tell it was a whole pile of nothing....so now im back at my mums house listening to radio LOL and yeh well that concludes my blog for now....im sure there will be plenty more to come LOL... checkyas laters...MWA
