Oh well.  2 down, 2 more to go.  I need to get this thing wrapped up before Thanksgiving if I want to graduate.    I am very ready for next semester, when I can just lounge around and read whatever books I want.  I still need to finish The Two Towers and Return of the King; Bill Maher's new book, several books on Cuba; and some other books I've been meaning to crack open for years, but never have had the chance to due to work/school, and they've just been collecting dust.  I've decided too, that I'd like to tutour Spanish to high school kids who want it or need it next semester.  Also, a trip to go see Mildred in Boston awaits me during her spring break in April, and maybe a ski trip with Aaron in January.  These things are what keep me going currently during this very stressful last semester at UT--plus my strong will and desire to have a diploma in my hands that says I graduated in 3 years.  I'm hoping that I'll add a "with honors" to that also; looking likely, but we'll see.  The important thing is the degree.  I'm going to bed early tonight.  Very excited about that.  Tenho fome/tengo hambre/I'm hungry.  Off to go raid the fridge.
