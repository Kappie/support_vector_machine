Been tidying up all morning, puttering around to get rid of the energy generated by excitement and nerves.  Still have yet to type up the notes from the last day of Torts class, but don't feel too bad about it.  Suppose I should look at my notes one last time before the exam, but I'm having a hard time pulling myself away from the Seattle Mix of '02 and the pics from the last two weeks' study sessions.    A year ago at this time I was tidying up in anticipation of the parents' and grandparents' arrival for the big graduation.  The weather was pretty similar, except that we'd actually had snow instead of just rain and chilly winds.  And I think today marks the one-year anniversary of the Morning Pages.  Started them the Thursday before Graduation, although the date in the notebook is a bit off.  Stupid leap-year anyway.  Let's just go ahead and say it was a year ago today, m'kay?  Feels like another life.  But then again, so does studying for the Property final two weeks ago.    There's been much moaning and groaning about school, exams, classes and even a couple professors during the last two weeks, much of it completely warranted and justified.  But I'm still sitting here smiling as I think back on the year.  It's an interesting feeling, in this time before the End.  Tomorrow will come and life will go on almost as usual, but for today, an entire experience hangs suspended, about to come to a close.  It's a time for celebration and release, but it's also a bit sad, as all endings are.    And I always cry at endings.
