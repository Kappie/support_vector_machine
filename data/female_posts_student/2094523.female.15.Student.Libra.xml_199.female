Which one wud u pick? obviously the bright side huh? but with me.. no matter which path i pick i always end up on the wrong side. Im a much bigger talker than i am doer. i say so much but i can never pull it off. its all talk all for show its not me at all. when will we ever come down to a point where we actually are what we wanna be. we're actually satisfied with everything in our life and have absolutely nothing to complain about. when we will all be happy? answer: never
