Because...mostly because I'm an idiot, but also because I'm so depressed right now, I don't even know what to do with myself. And I thought that breaking up with him would...ease some of the stress I'm feeling right now. I mean, the fact that I'm his girlfriend sitting here wanting to commit suicide...that must be hurting him on the inside. On top of that, I won't be home very much to talk to him or anything because mymother's suspecting that something's wrong, so she's been playing "shrink", and if I don't tell her what's going on soon, she's gonna take me to a real one. Which is scary. But, um, yeah, and I just feel like I'm a horrible girlfriend.But I couldn't put him through it. I told him that I didn't wanna break up, but "separate". But I'm wondering if he'll see it as a break-up. I didn't mean for it to sound like that. I'm such a frikin' idiot. But for once I've done what everyone has always told me to do: "follow your heart". So why do I feel like crap?     On top of that, I don't deserve him. I mean, he's so perfect and I'm just...a bitch. I suck as a girlfriend. He deserves so much better than me, and I hope he finds someone out there for him.
