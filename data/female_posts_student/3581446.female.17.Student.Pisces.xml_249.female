I shall now tell the story of how my life was changed.   After I had checked every orifice and cranny in my apartment, I sat down satisfied to eat my left-over pizza. There was only one slice left, and it was an unfortunate thing that it was a slice from my roommate's pizza: Hawaiian.   "Humbug!" I scowled at it as I heard a clanking noise; as if some person were dragging a heavy chain. I then remembered to have heard that ghosts in apartments were described as dragging chains. The balcony door flew open with a booming sound, and then I heard the noise much louder, coming straight towards me.   "Mercy!" I said. "Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?"   "Woman of the worldly mind!" replied the Ghost, "You will be haunted by the Spirit of Time and Old Age. Expect it at the hour of midnight. Look to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember what has passed between us!"   When it had said these words, the spectre took my slice of pizza from the table, looked at me with a wicked grin and vanished into thin air.   "Humbug! Choke on it." I muttered and went straight to bed.   When I awoke, the clock had already struck midnight. "The hour itself," I said, triumphantly, "And nothing else!" I laughed heartily. Just I prepared to return to bed, my eye caught a peculiar, sparkling object on the nightstand. Confused, I reached out and grabbed it by the handle. As I brought it closer I saw a horrible thing!   What was mirrored back was not my once appealing face, but a face haunted by age and time. It looked withered and gray. I watched in horror as wrinkles were being carved and bags were formed under my once exuberant eyes. The hairs on my head that were once a golden brown curled up, as if in shame, and turned an ugly white.   "Why?" I cried, "Why must this happen to me! How can I live in this young, fast-paced world now that I have turned, on the 5th of June, the old age of 23?!"   And so it was, PocKet's birthday carol. May we be blessed enough not to experience anything dreadful such as that. May that be truly said for us, and all of us! And so, as the mirror observed, God Bless Us, Every One!
