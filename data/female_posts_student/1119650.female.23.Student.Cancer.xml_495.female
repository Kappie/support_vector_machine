I had a great weekend of parties with friends, manicures and naps...oh yeah and a tasty assed lunch at Black Bear Saloon (c:  Only two more days at work until some more time off, I can make it, I promise...I'll tough it out.  Tomorrow starts my pre-NYE attempt at quitting smoking so I don't have to go cold turkey on Thursday morning.  I can do it.  Its easy, I'm just lazy, so since its another resolution to not be so lazy, I should be able to make it ok.  If I could sum up the year 2003 in one word it would be the following:  conjunctivitis-esque .  Yes, thats a word, Fuckers.  Anyhow, I got pink eye or pink eye like symptoms about six times this year.   urlLink It all started in February when I bought my Olsen Twins bath pouf  and I got it FIVE times since then.  What the hell.  I woke up Saturday A.M. all pink and itchy again.  What happened Friday night?  I finally threw out the Olsen's Bath Pouf (yes, I was smart enough to  not  use it) and the next day I wake up with pink eye.  I tell you, they're on a mission to ruin my vision, those little tramps.    Peace out, Cub Scouts!
