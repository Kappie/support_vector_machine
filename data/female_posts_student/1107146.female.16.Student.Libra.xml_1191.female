Block schedule, all my evil classes are split up and euro every day, my birthday is at the end of the week, i'm turning 16, we're going to pepo de buco (or whatever that new restaurant is), and X2 on saturday. sounds like fun. then I get into Robobitch's class and find out that the defense is not allowed to make a case because Mike has a clue and Mrs. Bitch's hand picked prosecution is worthless and incopetent.  ok im not going to let that get to me, then shinkarev for an hour and a half, fine its ok, still not mad.  Before I go further I need to describe the birthday situation for the last few years.  On my birthday we lose the soccer game sptaculary(don't fucking care about spelling), Im wished happy birthday only by aunts(except for the last 5 minutes before I go to bed then my parents finally remember), it always ends up that I get mocked by walt then one of my parents while the other one is yelling at me,and then Walt gets his presents before I do (his birthday is june 1 mine is may 3). and we have wretched ice cream cake.  ok having said that im going to go up the list, I'm going to go get my cake tomorrow(not one of the ice cream cakes that my parents are going to insist on) I got a twenty dollar stove a couple of months ago but the one thing I want is denied because walt is grounded and Once he gets ungrounded hewill refuse to play it with me because hes a whiny bitch.  one aunt has wished me happy birthday . . . i think. Ive already gotten mocked twice by my dad and walt and my birthday's not till tomorrow.  heres where it gets different instead of losing one fucking game this year I get to lose two and then get mocked by walt because he has a good team surrounding him and they win.  I need to start having birthday parties again, away from my family, maybe then people won't spend their time laughing at me.  by the way if I throw a birthday party, I don;t get to plan it or even get to chose who i invite( the list made out by my mom would include my best friend from elementary school who now spends his time making cracks about me, a boy I have'nt seen in years, and all of their friends, fun , fun, for everyone but me), and if by some miracle i do manage to get some people on the list that iv spoken to in the last year, they would have fun talking about the goings on at BA and then  a refreshing game of pin the tail on the donkey or some other nonsense like that.    sorry, lindsey for using your blog as a place to rant but im afraid if i didn't i might explode.  im also sorry to anyone who ive offended . . . o wait if ive offended you than either you don't like obsenities (which i do apologize for) or you are one of the ones at who manages to make my birthday the Hell on earth every time (in which i don't give a fucking rat's ass)  My dad just came over and told me to get a picture of me in a fucking indian costume rotated 90 degrees. yay fun!
