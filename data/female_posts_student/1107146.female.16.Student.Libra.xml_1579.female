They regularly communicate with other dogs, all cats ever communicate is "get out of here" and "I like you".  which do you think is smarter a fly or a colony of ants?  a lone creature or one that has lots of friends to help it? dogs are therefore smarter than cats c) dogs are pack animals ergo better friends.   d) dogs can and will protect you and your house.  Have you ever heard of a cat that prevented a burglary? e) and most certainly the best reason, my mom is not allergic to dogs, as she is to cats
