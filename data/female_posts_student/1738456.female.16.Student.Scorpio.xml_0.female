The hands on my watch spun quickly; there was no concept of time here.  The road ahead of me seemed to drop at my feet. I stared down at the bottom and watched the path fade into the grass. Near the end, the cobblestones had been pushed out as the grass pushed its way through the stones. I didn’t know how to get down the hill; it was scary looking down at my potential death or maiming. So I sat down, closed my eyes, and started scooting down the cliff.  I didn’t open my eyes once, and I felt my way down until soft spring grass was completely under me. I opened my eyes and stood up. A huge field of grass stretched out ahead of me. I glanced behind and there was no path behind me at all. I smiled and ran ahead, into the center of the field. Smiling I starred up at the treeless horizon and spun. The stars above me quivered. I was happy to be away from danger. I sat down to catch my breath, and the world slowly stopped spinning, but the stars didn’t. Fireflies were the first thought in my head. I reached up to grab one.  “Lemme go!” a shrill voice said, and I immediately opened my hand palm up.  “Sorry,” I said.  “Again with the touching things,”  I added silently. I looked closer. “You’re not a firefly,” I marveled. The thing in my hand appeared to be nothing but a ball of light.  “Wonderful deduction Dr. Obvious, anything else you’d like to tell me that I already know?” It shook sarcastically.  “I just didn’t know what you were, sorry.”  “I am a singer,” it said melodically. “My brothers, and sisters, and I sing people to sleep in the night sky.  “Really? How wonderful, sort of like the Sandman.”  “Oh no!” It shook violently, “We are much superior to the Sandman, he doesn’t even do anything. We bring your dreams at night. We are the ones that lull you into the slumber that you need. We are singers.” I breathed out slowly and crossed my eyes trying to get a better look at what was in my hand. I could see nothing, but twice as many lights around me.  “Could you sing for me?” I asked. The ball began to shake, and more surrounded my hand. They outlined my arms and shoulders, and I had the strange sensation of tingling in my body. I felt like I was floating, and the air was filled with a melody that I had heard before. My eyes grew heavy, and I knew I was supposed to be doing something other than sitting in this grass. I just couldn’t remember what. I leaned back and watched my hands glow with the light of the singers around me. I would have twirled in their song, wrapping it around me like a blanket, if I had had the energy. Instead, all I could do was smile softly, and try to hum.  I kept trying to remember what it was I was supposed to be doing. Nothing at all would come to mind. So I closed my eyes to think, and the last thing I remembered was floating on a cloud of lights, then everything went dark.
