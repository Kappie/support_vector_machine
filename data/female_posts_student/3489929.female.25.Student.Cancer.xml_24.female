Sometimes your feelings are so strong that it's easier for you to pretend that everything's ok, even when it's not. Take the pressure off your internal emotional build-up by letting off a little steam in a socially acceptable way. Tackle football or bullfighting may not work for everyone. Find something physical that works for you.      Something physical as in... breaking down at your desk and crying and shuddering so hard that someone in your office thought you might be having a seizure (Cracky tends to overdramatize)?    I will be pounding it out on the Gazelle (or the "antelope," as Lisa calls it) tonight.   But in all seriousness... my day ended much better than it began. I pulled Posh aside (without throwing her out of the window) and explained that I was frustrated and then my afternoon began to be better. And out of the goodness of my heart (actually, I got trapped into it), I stayed an hour late and helped Posh clean the office.   But I couldn't resist coming around a dark corner and yelling, "Look out!" at the top of my lungs. It did my devilish little heart good to see her jump a full foot in the air. :)   Maybe tomorrow will be better.
