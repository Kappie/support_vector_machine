I KNOW that I could have done better if I wasn't rushed, and had more time, didn't feel pressure to finish, and could just take the time and think through the questions.  I did feel really good today.  I got to use the scantron machine thing and got to scan through like a whole bunch of classes tests.  It was really neat to see how it's actually done, and it was really cool to be able to do it.  I felt good that my English teacher trusted me to do that cause it was sooooo cool.  Then in active living I got to take attendance for the class.  He is also helping me on Monday with my reading comp.  No matter how hard I try, it's difficult.  I think there is like something wrong or something.  It's hard to explain, but I am tired right now and I don't feel like trying cause my Mom wants me to talk to her and I am going over to Mat's for dinner.
