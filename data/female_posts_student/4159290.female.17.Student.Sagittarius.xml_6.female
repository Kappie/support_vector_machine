I got poison ivy on my butt and a little on my leg from having to sit on the river bank during that hail storm, (I was wearing a swim suit). It wasn't that bad before, but, omg, it itched  so  bad when I woke up.   I nearly cried... like literally, it was so painful.  I got outta bed, and asked daddy where the stuff for it was (he bought a bunch the other day, cuz he got it on his legs too) and he went to the car and got this cooling spray stuff for me.  And I feel much better now.  Except for the waking up at 6 after going to sleep at 3:30 part.  And I'm waiting for Cindy's dad to get out of the shower, cuz I have to pee really really bad...  then I can go back to sleep.
