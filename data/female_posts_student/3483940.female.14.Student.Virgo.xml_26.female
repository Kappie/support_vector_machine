No i dont think it is. because i don't like him that way anymore. Nope.  "Miss you less, with each day your gone" (The Greatest Fall Of All Time, By Matchbook Romance) Well all the days are gone, i no longer "Miss" or "Like" him. And if there was another day to see him, i still wouldnt like him. wow. this is amazing. I can't really describe how i feel. It just is.  Hannah
