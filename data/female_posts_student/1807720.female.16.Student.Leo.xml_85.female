I had the lines "Just when I thought things couldn't get any better, I closed my eyes and you showed up at my door" going through me head.  So then I thought I would try make a poem out of it but I didn't like even think of any of words in it.  They all sort of just "came" to me.  Strange isn't it.     A Feeling  Just when I thought Things couldn’t get any better I closed my eyes and You showed up at my door I thought it’s over But it’s never to late begin On this journey I feel like I am starting to win  Closed my eyes, now I see Took my hand, now I feel Love is something that is real That’s the way it should be Together, just you and me Feel like I am flying above and beyond all the earth I found my wings and now I can breath, I can breath This feeling inside is how I am  suppose to feel, this feeling is real  I never knew that life  could have so many turns, all those bumps in the road I never thought of how someone Can walk into your life And turn your life around I never dreamed before of a life like this A life full or respect for me That is how it is suppose to be I finally see, I finally see A feeling described, a feeling so close Something now, a feeling so real  ~Vanessa     So yesterday I had some people over and we watched Freaky Friday and played Mad Gab for like two hours.  Then we played air hockey and everyone seems to like that.  Then I went to the movie Something's Gotta Give which was absolutely hilarious.  I am almost done my social stuff too!  I feel like so non-stressed right now and that feeling is so amazing.  I feel like the enegizer bunny for once.  My head is clear and I realize that I can have so much more confidence than I think I have.  I can do so many more things that I had though.  I wish we had break earlier because realizing all these things would of really helped me a couple months and well when we get back to school it's pretty hard to raise a mark in two weeks, but anything is possible right!??!?  Tonight Melissa and Ben are coming and we are having a big dinner thing, like usual.  And you know what I am not going to worry about what I eat, life it too short to worry about that.  You know I really came to a realization today because I thought that when I lost weight all my problems would be gone and there would be nothing to worry about.  Like yeah right!  There is more to worry about it feels, and it didn't solve anything.  I am just going to enjoy my holidays and if I do happen to gain weight then it can always be lost again anyways and it's not the end of the world.  I just want to be happy and have fun.  And I am happy right now.
