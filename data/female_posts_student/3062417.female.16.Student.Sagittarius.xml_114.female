It was just another boring day of school that I wish I never had to go through. It sucks and I hate it. I don't know why but all day today all I've wanted to do was cry and have someone tell me that everything is going to be ok. And it just helps  so  much that I just got to talk to Gavin for only 5 mins and I didn't even get to tell him anything. I was going to ask him if he wanted to do something tonight too. He probally would have said no but I guess I'll never know now.  I guess that is just my sad self talking. School actually wasn't horrible today. There were a couple of good parts. Like my double-lunch today and study hall with Molly, Heidi, Heather, Kayla, and Lisa. "It's like a pillow. Do you blow them up sometimes?"-Heather (don't ask) That was probally the best part of the day though. I do like signing everyone's yearbooks though.  Ohh how I hate my life.  Listening to: [Head Up by Sugarcult]  Keep your head up The colors are beautiful When they say give up Turn up your radio All the sentimental memories you own When they say grow up It’s just like a funeral  Keep your head up The colors are beautiful Keep your head up It’s all right in front of you When they say wake up You’re braking ridicule When all the sentimental memories you own  Keep you trapped inside your room there all alone  And it feels like It feels like you’re lost And it feels like It feels like you’re lost  Is there some way you can be out on your own?   Trust yourself Don’t waste another day at all    On your own  Keep your head up The colors are beautiful And it feels like It feels like you’re lost And it feels like It feels like you’re lost  Is there some way you can be out on your own? Trust yourself Don’t waste another day at all  Watch this fade away Everything fades away Keep your head up The colors are beautiful
