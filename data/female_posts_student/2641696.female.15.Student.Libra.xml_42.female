Which is pretty cool, considering it took the layout team days and days to get as far as we did in just a few hours. So anyways, hopefully my @#$%!! piece will get published ^^; I toned down a few parts, made my point a bit more subtle in others, and niced it up for all the baby niners... so, hopefully the admin. will be pleased. I also handed in my resume and cover letter... ack! I might end up being Newspaper Editor next year o_O Personally, I think I'm far too immature, but the Doc asked me to at least send in the resume, so whatevah. If I do get chosen, I sure as hell won't be as docile as SC was this year. Spunk! Pizzaz! Life! No more of this 'can't offend the SAC school'-ness!   Not that I have a choice, of course.   Also nice is that I practically finished my comp. sci. assignment. I'm staying after school on Monday to do the VB part, but after that I'm homefree. Yayy! All that's left are those damn Civ. research pieces... *sigh* I'm avoiding it. But tomorrow I'll wake up at 8:00 and get to it. Mr Y will not be displeased! ^^;   And finally, for your amusement...          From  urlLink The Jongleur .
