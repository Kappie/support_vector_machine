We played tag but the catch was you had to stay on this path that lead in a circle so we were just chasing eachother around in circles! Haha. The I made her push an ice cube accross the carpet with her nose! Hahhaa. Then she had to pick up the cube with her toe and bounce accross the carpet. Haha. It was so much fun. Then we did streches...they kinda hurt!! I made her spin her arms around in circles like 50 times. Haha. It was so fun!  I am in such Ã¥ weird mood!  Whoa look at that a! COOL!
