And don't say I didn't warn you!    Good grief I need to get laid. I know I normally don't talk about my sex life with, well, anyone, but the midweek visit with Jerm threw me off my schedule of only weekend sex... that was nice. We were too sleepy when I arrived after visiting the sister, but whoa, some lovely morning sex after a night of sexy cuddling. Very nice stuff. But now I'm wanting more, again, and a few more times after that. Maybe it's the new pill. I haven't felt this randy since I was 19 and hooching it up, except now I'm actually getting off and I know a little bit better what I'm doing. All I have to say, is if these are the side-effects of the generic pill, I'll take it. I think ortho-tricyclen was inhibiting my desire a bit. It was part of why I wanted to get off the pill. But this is better, because increased horny-ness tends to equal pregnancy if you aren't on the pill. And in light of recent events, I've been feeling even more paranoid about the pregnancy demon. No little bastard babies for me! No thank you. Or my increased libido is due to getting some mid-week... I swear, the more often I do it, the more I want to do it. If I don't do it a lot, I forget how much I like it, and tend to be lazy about it. Thank goodness I'm going back to see the Jerm tomorrow... I can get Jerminated. Hee hee. I've been meaning to make that joke for a while, it just never seemed appropriate. Oh well, lucky you to read this, I'm likely to delete it later from embarrassment. But now I feel no shame.  Oh, and to add another idea I've been pushing about in my brain: sometimes I miss sleeping with all kinds of interesting people. Or at least making out with random guys/girls when drunk, etc. I kind of miss exploring my hetero-flexibility. I know some girls aren't into lesbian/girl-on-girl action, but that stuff is more exciting then seeing guys in porn. It's probably because guys in porn are nasty and frightening, at least more so than girls in porn. But anyway, I love Jerm, but sometimes I miss the freedom of being single. Maybe it was just the situations I was in, but it was so easy and fun to see if I could get a guy into bed. It's probably because I was 19. Guys just wanna do you when you're 19 and all naive, yet legal. It's weird. I guess it's that I still wonder if guys find me as desirable now as they did then. Now I put out that whole "not interested" vibe, although maybe this is coming up because a cute guy who says smart things smiled at me and I smiled back. It was an old-timey, high school kind of feeling. He was one of those smart, dorky, cute guys. I'm such a sucker for that; brains are hot. Good thing that's what Jerm is, or I wouldn't be happy at all (don't forget, engineers do it better). When I was in high school I'd have the deepest crushes on the loud, brainy, cute guys, and my friends would tease me about not liking the asshole jock. I'm sorry, I've never liked jocks since they were assholes to me in elementary school and middle school, and I have to get to know a jock before I'll let my guard down. Now they're all frat boys, and I still hate them a little bit. Oh well, way too much deep reverie for now. I better get back to work.
