Me: Yeah, and you can relate to Andy because he likes sports. Dad: He's very intelligent, too! Me: Haha. Good one, Dad. Dad: Well, he is intelligent, in his own way!  Haha. I love when I get my parents to say that kind of thing about my brother. It just makes my day.  Until I forget about it and it has absolutely no effect on my day after all. Hm.
