Who knows what good it will do, but here you have it.  Dear Mr. Nader,  I first must say that I have much respect for you, your beliefs, and your efforts. I wholeheartedly support your political platform, and under different circumstances I would be one of your most avid supporters. But as the world stands at this moment, I am compelled to take a different stance. Thus, I am writing in an attempt to persuade you to cease your current presidential campaign. I am not doing this because I am against you, but rather that I cannot be "for" you when it might mean that Bush will regain the Whitehouse and our country will have to suffer another four years being led by the worst kind of fool rather than another.   I feel that for the benefit of the United States, as a whole, this country needs to band together as much as possible to oust Bush. He has "led" (I use that term loosely) the US down a dangerous road that will have grave results for the US people and the citizens of the world - some of the backlash we have already seen. With Bush in office for another four years the US will only continue to lose power in the world theatre of politics, continue to get into greater debt, continue to jeopardize social security, continue to ignore the roots of educational issues, continue to not provide for its people and others around the globe in need, and continue to create a conservative christian government that believes itself to be the only truly important government on this globe.   I sincerely believe that putting another person in the Whitehouse this year is key, and I am sorry to say (and you have to be aware) that sadly, you can not be that person. Barring Kerry dropping out of the race, there are too many barriers for a third party to achieve election for a national office. Our current US government system is not built to support/host three parties at this current time, and legal changes need to be waged against the federal and state governments before a three party system can truly exist that is in any way representative and viable. For now, a third party simply syphons votes from other candidates/parties rather than having a dedicated electorate of their own party that is sizeable enough to gain a majority vote.   I would like to see the two party system change, as I feel a multiparty system would greatly benefit both our country's voters and governing methods. Two options on how to stand for an issue is not enough. The world is not black and white and neither are the opinions of the electorate. Changing to a multiparty system needs to happen - and it will. But this change will take time, and I believe that you can make great inroads into changing the political party organization policies of the US using your individual skills and talents. It will require funding and a federal government edict - but I know in the not too distant future we will see an Independant and Green Party Candidate (or something similar) on every ballot for every office. That time is not now. I think your efforts are better placed in creating the multiparty system for the citizens of the future, rather than running for national office under the current two party system.  Some have the sad tendency to "what if" about the 2000 presidential election and wonder if Gore would be in office now if you had not run in 2000. How different would the world be? How many lives would have been spared? I know many people ponder these things, letting their brains run in indefinte circles. Really the 2000 elections are more or less a moot point now - but it would be a shame to see people spend even more time letting their minds run on the hamster wheel of "what if" about the 2004 elections. Not to say that anyone blames you for the votes Bush got (illegally or not.) But, I cant help but sometimes join the wondering: "Would Gore have been able to carry the presidency if it had been a 2-way race?" Speculation on this point is, as I mentioned, too little too late. Many political analysts have wasted hours writing and thinking about the way 2000 election might have gone, and the way Gore would have led the country after 9/11. I do not intend to waste my time this way, nor yours. But for the overall benefit to the future of our country, I ask you to stop this candidacy.  I support your political platform wholeheartedly, and if it was a two way race between you and Bush this letter I am writing would have a wholly different content. I can understand that you want to stay in the race until the point where we can tell whether Kerry is staying without a doubt. I dont want this country to be stuck choosing Bush, Bush, or Bush. But before that fateful date of polling in November I must ask, beg, plead, whine, whimper, and cajole you let go of your presidential dreams for the 2004 election year. I know many of the voters that would vote for you are as much against Bush as anyone. Their votes would be better served to remove him from office if they are counted on Kerry's tab. I dont want this country to suffer another four years with a Bush as our nations leader.  Please consider my opinion and request/suggestion. I am not trying to be rude or insulting nor do I mean to ask you to be a quitter. I dont want you to quit your beliefs or third party efforts. I want you to continue - I feel that you have a great contribution to make to our "great society." But as for the Whitehouse, as for the currently two-way system, as for 2004 - please choose your fights wisely and consider the larger repercussions. I do not mean this letter to be offensive or anger-inducing in any way, and am writing only to make some greater and personal effort to un-elect our current president. I hope you can understand my views and my wishes, even if you dont quite see eye to eye with them. Consider my opinion please, and take just a moment to think of the potential greater good.   Sincerely, (included real name and contact info here)  All the news in fits of print for the moment - Mack
