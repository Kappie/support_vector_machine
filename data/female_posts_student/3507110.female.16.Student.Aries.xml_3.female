Wednesday night was like any other night, except that I had just gotten off the telephone with someone I hadn't spoken to in so long, someone whose voice grabbed me and pulled me some curtain and made me smile. After we had said our goodbyes, and with the promise of seeing the person the next day, I set about finishing up the last of the day's work then settling down on the couch to read my book. What caught my eye first was red letters that spelled tornado and then the word warning following. My heart dropped and I immediately journeyed outside to look at the dark spray of clouds that had been painted on the Western horizon. It was eerily silent and calm until the sirens began to wail in the distance. One began its long keening moan, then another, then another, so ominous that I actually got chills so real I felt like ice had been dumped on top of my head. I was nervous, scared, but I knew that getting completely off my rocker wouldn't help anything. My mother and I stayed calm. We stood like two sentinels by the storm door, watching through the window as the sky got darker and listening to the literally never ending thunder and the brillaint flashes of lightning that lit the sky up every few seconds. Around 9:00, We ventured back inside to watch the news, closing up the back porch tightly and making sure all of our pet cats were safely in the strong walls of the house. When the news just kept singing the same old song, and the wind and the rain and the hail were becoming hard to ignore, my mother stood up and went to look out our inside door. When I heard her mutter Oh My God, I reluctantly put my book down. I couldn't stop reading, I'm not sure if it was because I was actually engrossed in the book or it was an escape from the weather. The wind was blowing so hard it made the house shake and the rain disappear. And that's when the whirlwind started. The tree in front of my house gave a loud crack and the only thing I remember seeing before my mother pushed me backwards as the branch land right in front of the door. I was amazed but not frightened, in awe but not scared. My mother raced around the table to grab the flash light and she quickly ushered me and my dog down into the musty confines of our old basement. I wasn't worried at all about my safety, I was more worried about my cats. I had raced into the living room to grab them and all of them looked up at me as if to say, Are you leaving us behind? I couldn't grab all of them, I couldn't take them with me. So I turned and walked calmly for the basement, my mother practically screaming at me to get down. We no sooner arrived in the safe corner of the basement when the house gave a mighty shudder and a loud crack and crash drowned out the wind. Then, the lights flickered and went out and nothing but the flashlight's beacon kept us from the drowning blanket of darkness. It felt like forever but it had only been four or five minutes. When we ventured back up, the yard was littered with branches, many of them large and laying on top of something. Our 100 year old willow tree, my favorite tree, was cracked nearly in half, the mighty giant finally toppled, laying in waste across the road and partially on our other tree. I felt so overwhelemed, so lost, because my mother was lost. The pillar of strength that I had known her as had faltered that night and I know that she had lost it and all that kept us grounded and somewhat sane was me. It was me who had been calm, me who kept looking on the bright side of things. The bright side, the little things that made the stars and the moon pop out of the clouds and wave hello as we walked around our yard speechless. If the wind had shifted only a bit, if it had blown faster, harder, I might have not been able to walk around my yard, or I would have been painfully lost in the basement, or worse, I could be fine and everyone else could have been hurt, could have been killed. The little things like that really get to me, they really grab me and yank me around. It's the little things that mean so much, little gestures, little sayings you never forget, little looks that linger in your head. Little touches and caresses and kisses that mean more than anything else, that are worth more than diamonds to you. I think that is why I miss you so much. Because I miss the little things. And because I'm destined to miss the little things. I told myself long ago that I would wait for you. And I'm not sure if you know it or not. I'm prepared to wait for you forever if that's what it takes. The path I have chosen isn't the easiest, it bends, it twists, and is full of emotion but it's the path I am prepared to take. The next time I see you is when I'll know that for sure. I'm alive.
