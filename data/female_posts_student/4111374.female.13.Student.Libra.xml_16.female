Ok one is when I was in year two, and we had to have swimming lessons at lane cove pool and then so ok, i was like ill do backstroke and so you know how you like sit on the wall??? I would draw a picture but I cant so like, yeh. So anyway, im in year two so I was wearing a one-piece cozzi and I push of from the wall and the straps came off my arms and I shot back so fast that my cozzi flew off and I was left wading NAKED in the pool in front of the WHOLE YEAR!!! as you can tell it was very embarrasing but also strangely comfortable... MORE EMBARRASING MOMENTS COMING SOON...(if i can be bothered)
