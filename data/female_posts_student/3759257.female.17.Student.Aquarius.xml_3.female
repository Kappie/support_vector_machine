I was gona go buy some Reef's from Gavin's shop - Overload surf or sumink in Aberaeron(go there its good), but i looked a mess, so i didnt really want to walk in there (lol but seriously a REAL mess) So no i didnt go, reef's must wait till monday. I got chili Pepper photos back tho! wow there's one of us all @ the front taken by the stewards, but some of the pics are blury. Flea came out best.
