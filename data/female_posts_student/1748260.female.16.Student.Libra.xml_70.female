Modern dance practice was cancelled today.. AGAIN...Lazy to go for volleyball... well I've got no idea why..I'm juz feelin' down... However... I juz wish I'm in church everyday.. I find that in there.. I really feel the peace... The speaker ..Last Sunday.. Pastor/Evangelist Rani Sebestian.. was really GOOD... I attended 3 services... out of the blue moon... She preached about how you can never have a sheep unless you have a shepherd's heart...how we should go out  "save" other people..how we can talk to God like a best friend.. what's more.. a lover :D.. Saturday Pastor Jeremy Seaward preached about the seed  the sower..part 3 of it...Last friday brother Raju preached abnout how we must keep aside some time to spend with God....juz like how we keep aside some time for our loved ones...Well..bein' in church makes me feel the best....
