I have a few traumatizing ones, but a nice non-cringeworthy (relatively speaking) one is the time I was changing at a relative's house and accidentally left my underwear in the bathroom. With blood on them. And then my grandmother found them and left them in the very public sink to soak. I spent many a happy hour that day ranting to my sister about the terribleness of that, but today's events were, I believe, embarrassing enough to top even that.    When left to myself, I am a romantic. I climb trees, tear up at sappy books, steadfastly believe that the movie will have a happy ending and the soap opera characters will get together. Not that I watch soap operas.  *Hem*  Anyway, I'm a positive person. Or, I am until I'm faced with the harsh reality of romance in my own life. Now, I might cherish a nice little crush in my mind, but once I dare tell my friends about it, everything is shot to hell. I go into super-self-conscious mode, with my mind darting to each and every flaw that my friends might see in my crush. Within the first hour I've convinced myself that they think he's a loser, and that they're just too nice to tell me about it. By the end of the next day the crush is effectively over, and I cringe when I look back on what a pathetic mess it made me. That's what usually happens.    This time things went a little bit better. Natalia is actually kind of friends with The Boy In Question, and even after I told her and Henna about it I was able to retain my sanity. I even managed to have some conversations about him, gleaning personal information and whatnot, without losing interest (although I did kind of feel like a stalker).    Enter today. I was instant messagingthe two aforementioned girls, and the conversation turned to boys, as teen-girl-conversations are wont to do.Now, at first I supported this. They were trying to figure out a way to get us together, and they came up with this plan that involved my logging onto Natalia's account and instant messaging him from there, pretending like I had logged onto her account accidentally and didn't know who he was. At first I supported this plan, albeit reluctantly. But as the day went on I started to freak out more and more, thinking of all the little things that could go wrong. I felt so pathetic, wasting all this time and energy on a boy who was really nothing special. And who was I to obsess about anyone, even him? Why did I think that I was interesting enough, pretty enough, funny enough, to be deserving of anyone's affections? There is a boy in my school who is offensive andsort of ugly, with the worst sense of humor in the world. He tries to flirt all the time, and always gets brushed off. What made me any different from him?    And so, by the afternoon I had freaked out to the point where any little thing could push me over the edge.I was online when my sister in her phone-impatience logged me off the computer by lifting the phone off the hook. I yelled at her, slammed her door, ran down the stairs fuming, and sat down to watch  Jeopardy!  in a huff. Right then I resolved to give up on the whole thing. When I logged back on to the internet a half-hour later, I acted like a bitch to my friends. If I had to be pathetic, at least I could act like I didn't care, and so escape with a shred of dignity.    I thought today ranked with my most embarrassing moments. But really, the only thing that made it so terrible was my acting like an idiot. This guy is a nice guy, and it doesn't matter what my friends think of him. I wish I could have been brave for once. I don't know. I just need to relax and not get so worked up over shit.    I don't know why I'm writing about boys so much. I'm such an un-boy-oriented person that it's laughable. I would try to psycho-analyze myself, but I'm tired and it's getting late and I have to eat dinner soon. I'm just going to edit this and then post it. Later I'm going to make sure that my blog is un-offensive and then tell my friends where to find this entry. As an apology and explanation. Guys- Sorry I'm such a freak. (And sorry for calling you 'guys'.)    Hopefully I'll have something non-psycho to post later.
