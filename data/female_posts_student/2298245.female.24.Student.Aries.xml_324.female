This time I was not disappointed as I found  urlLink Do I dare? , a great journal type blog.  Those who know me well can probably guess what it is about this particular title that would pull me in.  For those who do not, I will allow myself a slight digression, to quote from  urlLink my favorite poet :   And indeed there will be time   To wonder, “Do I dare?” and, “Do I dare?”    And then:   Do I dare          Disturb the universe?   In a minute there is time   For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.    And the part that immediately came to mind:   Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?   I do not know if this was the blogger's intended reference, but I suspect that it was.  And I submit the following  urlLink portion of a post from her blog  as evidence in support of my conclusion (scroll all the way to the bottom):   What life have you if you have not life together? There is no life that is not in community, And no community not lived in praise of GOD. Even the anchorite who meditates alone, For whom the days and nights repeat the praise of GOD, Prays for the Church, the Body of Christ incarnate. And mow you live dispersed on ribbon roads, And no man knows or cares who is his neighbour Unless his neighbour makes too much disturbance, But all dash to and fro in motor cars, Familiar with the roads and settled nowhere. Nor does the family even move about together, But every son would have his motor cycle, And daughters ride away on casual pillions.  TS Eliot.
