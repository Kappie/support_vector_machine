Truth be told, I'm waiting for my best friend to get her butt over here and pick me up so we can go eat dinner. She is NEVER on time, and it drives me insane! Ok. Never is a harsh word. I guess my hunger is driving my emotions at the moment. It can do that, you know. Sure, hunger isn't quite like sleep depervation, but it still produces some pretty bizarre effects.    But I'm slipping away from the topic.    What  is  the topic, you must be wondering.   It is this - Forget about the war on terror. Forget about the culture war. Forget about the war on drugs. Forget all of it, I tell you. For there is a MUCH bigger war going on right now.    What war?    The  urlLink Conservative 'Ketchup War'     Oh yes. I'm not kidding. And believe me, I  wish  I was.
