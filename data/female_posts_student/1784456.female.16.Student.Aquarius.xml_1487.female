(okay, okay, so I reached to put the phone on the floor, on it's charger and acidentally head butted it) Geez, I'm dangerous, lucky no one's here! Anyway, breaking away from my musings, err to the err still non-existant point. *yup i came on here to make myself feel stupid, i reaaaly need a computer for that* Anyhoo, only a week away till school! Aaah! Okay, so it kind of sucks stretching my brain when it could be rotting in front of the tv, but it is fun to be around friends and mess about!
