I gave him a "Thank You" card, and when he was kinda telling everyone bye, he came up to me and told me what an amazing time he had getting to know me, and I said a lot of the same kinda thing on the card I gave him. Well today I read a lot, I only have 1 chapter (110 pages out of 620) left in A Prayer for Owen Meany. I recommend it, it's an interesting and enjoyable book. At 5 I went to a Girl's Retreat meeting. It's going to be so fun :D Our commercial appeared at church yesterday, and the whole congregation was cracking up. The commercial mocked the Six Flags one, it was so funny cus we had someone do the dance too. I'm pretty sure I wanna get some Roos (shoes.) Well now I'm kinda hungry, so I'm gonna see what's for supper.
