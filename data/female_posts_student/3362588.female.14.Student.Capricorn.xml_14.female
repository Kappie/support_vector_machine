They tried to make it a law that every one would be nudists in my country too, give me a break.  (for all of you who don't know, I play Jennifer Nations.  It's an online game where you make your own nation and then the game will send you 'issues' you have to deal with.  And then by the way you make laws out of the issues is how your country succeds in the world.  pretty fun)  I gotta make this short, 'cause I have to go to bed.  Youth was okay.  I had a major tummy ache the entire time.  And Destiny kept chattering on and on.  Between her and Ryan and John, they should start a rabbit trail league.  They can get off on some new subject off of anything.  It's so annoying.  Yma is a slacker.  She hasn't been to Youth in like forever.  And Josh lied to Mandy and said he was going to be there, when he really spent the night at someone's house.  Lier. hehe.    Ashes spent da night last night.  We watched Bruce Almighty.  Good movie.  Guess who picked it out???  My dad!!  Ashes and me were all looking for something PG rated ('cause we didn't want my parents to freak), and my dad picks our a Jim Carrey movie.  It's SOOOOOO funny!!!!!!!!  SPOON!!!  hahaha.  My mom had the remote, so we had to fast forward through two parts.  But hey, it's better then not watching it at all.  We stayed up until like 12.  Not bad for us. haha.  Talked mostly.  Tried to get the stupid excuse for a camping lantern to work, but no.  We didn't have enough batteries.  Talk to you peeps later,  Signing off,  Jack
