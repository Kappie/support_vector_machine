Yesterday night as you know Ashley spent the night so of course we were all hyper and and giggly lol. lol all 3 of us wake up and kels goes to the tv and ashley and I get on the comps. Well Will has to go so it's for girls at home and what are we doing either watching tv or sitting at the comps for 4 hours no one talked lol. finnally the silence was broke at lunch when everyone finally woke up and we had Pizza. It was great we all started singing random songs and stuff it was great lol, we then got back to the tv and comps and stuff ashleys mom then calls and my mom feels bad like shes a bad mom for letting us sit there so she makes us all go water plants lol. After this little project is done what do we do come back in and do the same thing well we had to be quiet b/c my dad was working from home well at 4 my dad gets ff workd and we get so loud it was awesome. We all had dinner yet still watching tv or being on a comp lol. 7:30 my dad starts watching tv and he goes to the music channels lol. WE all three get up and dance to like 50's music mainly lol it was awesome and we had it on superloud!!! We danced around and everyones like like omg Kristin can actually dance and im like uh ok.. O_o lol ashley and kels are liek Kristin teach me I ws still confused. Then my dad comes in and is like Kristin if you can ind a dance to all this music your talented and My dad always has to chalenge you to try andmake you look bad lol well he couldnt find one type of music I couldnt find some type of donace to do lol it was funny. It was one of the best laughes ive had and the most fun ive had in a 2 day period. After dancing though we all went swimming and it was around 9 it was fun but 2 bats flew around it was grosssss. Sadly though AShleys mom called and had her come home b/c her dad was drunk and my dad was now too so we were all like ermmm but yeah that was my day.   Teh Kristin
