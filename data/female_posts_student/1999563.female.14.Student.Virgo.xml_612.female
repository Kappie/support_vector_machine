I learned what a psuedo-christian cult is, why Atheist have to have way more faith than christians, how a New Age person believes they are God, what a leaver is, and MANY other things. I learned so much I just feel like...really smart. Hahaha. not that I will sound smart. But it's SO much easier to defend my fiath now that I know all the answers.  Hm.  Hahahah!!   I shouldn't make posts late at night.  I go cuhhh-razzzyy!
