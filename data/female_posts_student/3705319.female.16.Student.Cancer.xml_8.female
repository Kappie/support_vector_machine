The idea of the blog is so that people will be able to keep up with what we are doing in Cape Town. Each day a team member or a few team members will be charged with updating the blog with what has been going on that day. It will get some of our thoughts down on "paper" and will also let everyone who is interested know whatwe've been up to for information and for prayers.  Hopefully we will be able to upload photos to the blog mas well which would be rather cool. Won't know to we get out there though.  Viv
