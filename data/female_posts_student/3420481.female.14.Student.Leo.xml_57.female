After school Me and emily kand trent went to help at the 5th and 6th grade track meet but first we went to emilys house and got Ice cream cones! AT the track meet I meet all these crazy 6th grade boys who were really fun! Then I came home and ate dinner (Grilled cheese and soup, yummy!). I just finshed my math home work which I now get and now i'm here! Well thats all for now!             Fun Things    Don't feed the penguins!  TUNA TUNA TUNA TUNA!  Peace punch captin crunch!
