I sit and wait does an angel contemplate   and do they know the places where we go   when we're grey and old   cause I've been told that salvation lets their wings unfold      So when I'm lying in my bed   thoughts running through my head   And i feel that love is dead   I'm loving angels instead   And through it all she offers me protection   a lot of love and affection   Whether I'm right or wrong   and down the waterfall   Wherever it may take me I know that life won't break me   When I come she won't forsake me   I'm loving angels instead      When I'm feeling weak and my pain walks down a on way street   I look above   And I know I'll always be blessed with love   and as the feeling grows   She breathes flesh to my bones   and when love is dead   I'm loving angels instead
