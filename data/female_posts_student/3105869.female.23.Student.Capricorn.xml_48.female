The "I´m-fine, its-hot, not-doin-much, this-weekend-I´ll-see-a-movie, went-to-the-grocery store, have-to-put-the-groceries-away.." that style of email  sucks , think harder, you are wasting precious space on the internet.  Make something up, I don´t care, tell a story, an anecdote, no "nothings new, blah blah blah."  IRRITATING.  Yes I know we all generally lead mundane, sometimes redundant lives, so tell me how you feel, what is important, do something different.  You don´t have to be in a foreign country to have something to talk to me about.  Most, but not all emails I am getting are actually verbatim (I mean every other email I open has exactly the same lines in it, are you all sharing a preconcieved email and just signing them individually?) but from different people, so I am setting a new requirement, I will return  all emails composed of five lines or less .  Sorry, but it seems like nobody really wants to talk to me, so I shall be forced to seek revenge by making you feel exactly as I do.  ESP. those closest to me, you know who you are I have bitched about this for awhile.  A good idea for a filler, is asking questions of the other person, think of them as prompts.  My idea for a prompt to you all is:  Do you prefer Gucci or Prada, and why?  okay so thats kinda assinine, but you get the point.
