On Friday, anyone who doesn't have a final 6th period (talkin' to you, band people) I'm going home after 5th period finals are over (uh that's like 11:30...!) cause I don't have a 6th period, so come early if you want, cause I'll be bored...! I hope it's sunny.... really really hope it's sunny.... oh and bring your bathin' suit just in case we do wanna do stuff at Caitlin's house. Wait who am I talking to...? All 4 or 5 people who read my site? Fantastic. I'm so cool. I'm gonna go shoot myself now.  SO BORED.....!
