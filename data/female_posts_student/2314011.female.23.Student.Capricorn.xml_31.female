Had a opening and thought the rest would flow easily.  Finally made it to the computer, checked out the other bloggies of note only to find the Boy's own rendition of the incident on his blog.  Well, never being one to compete with greatness, I just copied and pasted the story from his.  Without permission, of course.  (Editor's note: the "S"s originally in my mom's name on Levi's blog have been changed to "C"s.)   Andrea's mom is a golden piece of work. A source of endless humor and entertainment without even knowing it. She can say things like "Looks like you just shot your wad!" without a clue of its sexual implications. That's precisely what we love about her. Our lunch was stacked with brilliant moments where Andrea and I were convulsing in hysterics and poor Cheryl was just wishing she could go sit at another table. "You damn kids..."   I can't wait to spend a week with her.   We all met at a crowded Johnny Carino's in Idaho Falls, waiting in the lobby with the herds of Mormon families lumbering their offspring in and out of carriers and over shoulders. There's no place like southern Idaho.  "If I had known it would be like this, I would have picked somewhere different." "Oh, like a place where they forbid children?" Not likely, in this state.   The girl and I haven't seen each other in nearly 3 months and our first words are to tell each other how damn hot we both look. And really, we're each at the top of our game and loving every damn second of it. She's let her hair grow into layered, shaggy fronds (very sexy), where I've chopped my locks for a slightly cleaner, sharper look which I've come to prefer, set off by my scruffy cheeks. She in her leather and I in my wool, we'd be all over each other if we both weren't gay...and sometimes we don't even let that stop us.   The event begins with an innocent vibrator joke from Cheryl when the buzzer tells us our table is ready...to be followed by Andrea's comment of: "I don't pack mine out of the house, mother!" and it pretty much grew from there. Things got better when our waiter revealed himself...no doubt in any of our minds on which side he liked his bread buttered. Something needed to be said, but how? Cheryl had only recently learned of my own leanings (which is a great tale in itself) and I wasn't really sure how we'd be dealing with the topic.   "What is it with Johnny Carino's?" Andrea's always great with openings.  "God, I know...it's like a secret brotherhood or something. But he's probably just a Mormon."  "Wouldn't be surprised, with that hair."  Cut to Cheryl shaking her head in disbelief, mumbling something like "you kids are terrible." but knowing deep down she adored our irreverence. She couldn't help bring up last year's Passport debacle, which is always good for a laugh or two. We get a glimpse of the hidden Cheryl, dark and saucy and wild. She could be unstoppable if only she would let herself.   Rather than help Cheryl pick out a watch for Christmas, the girl and I ditched her for our obligatory coffee-talk. I drove her back to her mountain fortress in Pocatello and didn't want to leave. We have so much to catch up on! So much to do and say and laugh about! (Like her mom!) But I had to forge onward...with the promise that I'd return bright and early on her birthday, to continue our adventure. I always leave her with the thought, "Remind me again why we don't live in the same town? why did we choose to do this the hard way?"   Good times.  Been hanging around the house this morning, going through the motions of coffee, getting ready, etc. at a very leisurely pace.  Love these days on break where absolutely nothing needs to be done and we're okay with that.  Had a great half an hour Yoga practice and am now ready to catch up on a little writing.  Yay!  Finally listened to Dido's new CD in its entirety while pounding out those Sun Salutations; stupid European blondes anyway!  Now back to the November Mixy.  It's brilliant, really.    So yea, the break's already feeling really great.  Took a bit to slide into, but now feeling utterly content to let the next three weeks unravel at their own pace.  Christmas is in two days and I'm actually really excited for it.  Get to wrap some presents today.  Mom's sick of wrapping and tried to get me to wrap a couple of my own presents.  That's where I drew the line; it just seems wrong in some way.  Might go to a little movie later, I dunno!  I realize this entry's a bit disorganized and little more than a smathering of random thoughts.  Maybe I should actually tell a story, hmmm.    The night after finals isn't really worth going into, except to say a more-straight-than-the-bi-vibe-she-wishes-she-gave-off-girl who likes to compete for attention in any way she can fell all over me all night.  Not in any way attracted to her, partially because she's a straight guy's fantasy of a lesbian (read: Hetero-Porn version of a lesbian [read: not a lesbian at all]), and partially because of the previous sentence's description.  But hey, we love attention and flattery.  She told all the men hovering around our lesbian sex discussion that she'd rather take me home than any of them.  So glad I don't have to see any of them for a month.    Almost finished with Cold Mountain.  The Boy decided we're seeing it together, so I've got a bit more time.  Trying to figure out how the movie's going to handle all of the characters Inman (that's Jude) encounters in each chapter.  The previews don't really give much away, so I'm hoping it's a good surprise.  Wasn't a fan of The English Patient.  Had the same reaction Elaine from Seinfeld did:  "Just DIE already!!"    Sooo, what else?  Oh!  Getting new glasses!  Yay!  Mine met the working end of a pool cue last week, so you know, that had to be remedied.  They're fucking expensive, though.  Jeeez!  That's where the above-described "shot your wad" line originated, by the way.
