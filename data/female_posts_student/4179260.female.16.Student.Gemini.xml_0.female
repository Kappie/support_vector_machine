Had drama practice today...which was awesome. tomorrow's the competition.Fingers crossed other classes will   suck  . haha. i really think we've got a good chance.Lets just hope no one screws up anything.I play the stupid school bitch. there's 3 of us in case ur wondering,syazna,arifah and myself. Akoy said "memang patutpun". which really made me think,   am i a school bitch  ? haha. I'm the  dumb  bitch, arifah is the   mengada   bitch and syazna is the   mean   bitch. we have a special walk and trademark and everything.which is sooo hillarious. it's like a scene from some crappy low cost american movie! haha.          there's this one part in the drama wer i hav to fall down... and since we've been practicing a lot lately, i've got bruises on my knees which   BLOODY HURTS  !!                 honestly, if i dont bitch abt someone there's really nothing to say. haha                  *dont try to tell me what to say*                               jaja
