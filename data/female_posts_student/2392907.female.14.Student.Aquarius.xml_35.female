I know I don't even have enough money to pay the rent but small things like this don't matter." "No, really." "No no no, I gotta pay you back for that ripped dress, right?" "Haha.. Ok then, just this time." "You mean there'll be another time?" Janey laughs.. rather embarrassedly, actually.  Adam scrounges around in his pockets. *Jingle jingle* "Oh crap. I've only got enough for one," he says rather sheepishly. Janey bursts out in laughter, like so: "AHAHAHAHAHA.. ahem. Don't worry, I'll pay for me. In fact I'll pay for both of us." Adam looks sheepish for the rest of the morning.
