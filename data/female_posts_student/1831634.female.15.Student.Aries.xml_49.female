WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TALK TO STUDENTS FROM OTHER CLASSES.  SHE INSISTS ON TALKING TO ME BECAUSE I AM "TOO QUIET".  OH MY FREAKING GOD.  but the cool thing was... fourth period, mrs lux wasn't there!  and she didn't have a substitute, either!  so we literally just partied for the first 50 minutes of class.  literally.  people were break dancing and whenever we wanted to get something, we just took the pass and left.  it was awesome.  and nobody came and checked up on us, either!  and then it turned out that mrs lux was at a meeting and a teacher was supposed to come... but then mrs lux came back and she was mad at the administrators and she felt that our "precious learning time" had been wasted, so she gave us the rest of the period to do whatever we wanted!  and she gave us each a handful of skittles.  =)  it was freaking awesome.  now.  about jack.  Exhibit A: convo with meng!  meng4meng: hihi! dilapidatedshack: AAAAAAAAAAH I'M GONNA KILL NING dilapidatedshack: AND TIANTIAN dilapidatedshack: grr meng4meng: why? dilapidatedshack: but that's okay dilapidatedshack: =) meng4meng: i do hope it had nothing to do with what happened during 3rd period dilapidatedshack: ahahaha dilapidatedshack: chuan comes up to me after school dilapidatedshack: "sunshine!  jack said he'd go out with you!" dilapidatedshack: me dilapidatedshack: "need to get to locker need to get to lock--- what?" meng4meng: go read my blog! dilapidatedshack: "jack said he'd go out with you!" meng4meng: it has some more details on what happned meng4meng: :-) dilapidatedshack: "okay... no." dilapidatedshack: "no?!" dilapidatedshack: "no." dilapidatedshack: "yes?" dilapidatedshack: "no." dilapidatedshack: "aww, the second person you've rejected in 2 days!" dilapidatedshack: "I know"  btw, the first person I "rejected" was chuan.  he asked me to marry him so he could have sex with me.  yeah.  not the way to go about doing that, chuan.  Exhibit B: convo with chuan!  AznDuffboy: oh that AznDuffboy: lol AznDuffboy: ok...
