It's meant to be 1200 words, and I've typed 131. >oD  I hope I finish this stupid assignment tomorrow.. There's even an oral component.. Grr..  I hate Religion .      I'm so bummed- Ricki-Lee Coulter's gonna be singing "Can't Get Enough Of Your Love" by Taylor Dayne on Australian Idol on Sunday. That's like,  my song ! Well, not  my  song, but I like singing it, y'know? And I was hoping I could sing it on Idol one day, but now I can't. Waaah. Nyehh. Baaah.      LOL, Comedy Inc parodied Hilary Duff's video for "Come Clean".. "My bathroom has too many windows.. I really should get curtains...But I always forget."

Art, Art, blew a fart,     And blew the whole damn thing apart."    -Zed, Police Academy 4: Citizens On Patrol
