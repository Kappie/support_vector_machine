It is about a girl that had migrated to London after that her birthday had come and she met Daniel Radcliffe at her birthday party in France Classic restaurant. She then fallen in loive with him and so did he..*what a nice story bout love*.. I don't know if i should make a new website specially for my story.. My friends think that the story is nice and lovely.. They all liked it so much but i think that i am going to get into trouble with the HARRY POTTER fans...and maybe Daniel himself...Give me a comment about this blog....
