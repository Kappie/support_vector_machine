And then I have the worry about being accepted to one of these places and what will happen if im not. Im allready stressed and I haven't taken the friggin test. And what happens if I am?(accepted) Can I move halfway around the country and still remain sane? And somehow make it through graduate school without starving? Im worried. REAL worried. ARGH its about 11pm and I still want to run tomorrow morning. I read something about how i should split my runs in 2, run in the morning and evening in order to beat this heatwave that is buffetting us in the midwest. Don't know if I can handle it. I may just sit up all night chewing off my fingernails. This is shaping up to be a tough year and I thought I would barely survive last semester. My braincells are allready cowering at the back of my skull, knowing what punishment they are in for. I've got a headache from all my web research. Hoorah.
