So I don't quite know what to make of this:  Johnny Depp, who surprised me with a nomination, managed to  urlLink pull off the upset last night by winning .  Last year they were  urlLink somewhat off as well , so perhaps I will write this off as an aberration, and stick with my tentative prediction of Sean Penn to win.  Still, it might be time to check the odds.
