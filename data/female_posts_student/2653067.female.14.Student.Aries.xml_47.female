Let us go over the situation very briefly. 1-Kevan likes boy.> 2-Boy likes Julie.> 3- Julie is mad because she doesn't like these situations. You know what? Something has to be done. I'm going to end whatever the hell's going on here because I really despise this sorta stuff. Gggaaaarrrrg! New subject please!  Coincidently, I've been having conversations on msn with the one I despised so much from the last situation (such as the one aforementioned) in late may. Yeah okay.. I don't feel like talking about these "triangular love situations" because quite frankly, I don't care for love anymore. I've been in too many stupid situations.  So today I might go to the mall with Sam and Rachael. Rachael wants to get a blazer and I've got no idea what Sam wants. I will be purchasing a poster. I fear that I will never be able to hang it up on my wall due to certain reasons (It's not porn or anything).  Well I'm going to go and eat some breakfast. Bye!  Oh yeah= -I think some Kevan-Robin-Julie time will be necessary. -I hate love. -I think Vanessa knows about my "Secret purchase" (lol). ~ A-Very-Perplexed-Julie  And to "Anon.", Thanks for the advice. Yes, I will take it because it's the right thing to do and because the same thing happened to me where I was in Kevan's shoes.
