Carl went to the funeral today. Carl also woke up with my flu that I had last week. HAHAHAH!! It sucks too.  August seems to be  going by really fast for me.  Only three more weeks here at my temp job and then back to school.  Nothing going on tonight either, I am going home and watching days, quitapulets, and of course NIP/TUCK, hopefully Christian will get naked again. YUMMY!!!!  He is so gorgous. It should be an interesting episode tonight. Still having a hard time finding a job. I have two interviews this week tomorrow and Friday. Wish me luck
