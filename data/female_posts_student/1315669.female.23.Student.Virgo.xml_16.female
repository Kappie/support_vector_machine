Sometimes I really do wonder if I really willed my life to be the way it has pathed out today. I guess we all subconsciously do. Sometimes in the middle of the day my mind will start to reel on it's own and start to review my own existence in this Earth. God..I realized just how very flawed I am and have become. The worse of all was, there isn't an inclination inside me to want to alter much (ok, so I'm constant in that field). Am I really what laws of nature said about entropy? Being non-resistant to the moulding mechanisms and being swayed in this revolting Earth? I guess I am. Seriously speaking I've let myself let loose in so many areas of my life that the bells in my puny brain has started to blink furiously in an alarmingly perilous level. I'm so resilient to changes in my life now, it's such a far cry of how I used to be before. I guess I'm totally non-narcissitic...I'm more sadistic and perverse about self mutilation. God knows if my liver will still be functioning by the time I'm 30. And yea...not forgeting my kidneys and uterus. ahhaha. Ok, I'm getting outta pt now. Oh, anyway I've gotten myself a totally wonderful guy in my life now! - throws confetti- Hehehe. Hopefully things will changed for the better...Somehow my gut feelings tells me everything might just turn out to be alright after all...=]
