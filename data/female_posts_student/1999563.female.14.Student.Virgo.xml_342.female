Thanks so much to all of you who have come out to have some fun with us, and who have volunteered and helped out in various ways...we have been so blessed by all of your help and prayers and we are really enjoying ourselves! In fact, I can\'t believe that so much of this tour is over already!  We are off a few days before we head out to NY. So we\'re hanging out in Chicago, working on some new songs, sleeping a lot and catching up on everything we can\'t do easily on the road. And I\'m letting my vocals have some rest too. I was wearing myself down a little bit; I think talking is my weakness! I love to meet new people, and I love to catch up with old friends at shows, so itâ€™s hard for me to hold back on the talking thing!! \"So then, my friends, because of God\'s mercy to us...offer yourselves as a living sacrifice to God, dedicated to his service and pleasing to him. This is the true worship that you should offer\"                      Romans 12:1 ....I have been reading this verse from stage every night at our shows. Funny how things we share with others sometimes are meant for us or help us so much in the long-run! Lately this verse has become so beautiful to me! God has been so good to me this tour, really speaking to me, comforting me, being gentle enough to me through this time of brokenness. Things have started to come into focus more and more for me. So many times we struggle through life wondering why does God want my life to be so hard? Why does He allow me to hurt? The point is He does allow us to go through enough pain to bring our weaknesses up to the surface, to make our weaknesses visible, so that in our weakness, He can show His power! How much do I love that? I desire to be weak in that case, because I want His strength at work in me!! \"Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ\'s power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ\'s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.\"  2 Cor. 12:9-10 I pray you are all doing well. Living a life of sacrifice to God, for God, for others...it is the only way to find your life truly, by losing it. By choosing every day who or what you will live for choosing to please God with every action, every thought, every little thing you do or don\'t do. And desiring that more than things that might temporarily make us feel better. Hope to see you soon! Look for us on our own tour possibly this fall!!! We are planning it right now, and so excited about our very own tour. Spread the news!!! Look for us in a city near you! Much luv--Tricia  \"FOR I KNOW THE PLANS I HAVE FOR YOU\", declares the Lord,  \"...PLANS TO PROSPER YOU AND NOT TO HARM YOU, TO GIVE YOU A HOPE AND A FUTURE.\"  *JER. 29:11 -We must be willing to get rid of the life we\'ve planned, so as to have the life that is waiting for us. -Joseph Campbell- --
