I met Len  Rik at the bus station at 5.30 and we went to Rileys. I felt really sorry for Rik because he was ill and looked kinda tired, but he didn't look as ill as the woman that Len showed me on the wall *shudders*. Anyways, Rik went home and I was like "Aww, bless him!" Played pool with Len and the bitch thrashed me every time! =( hehe, he should think before he talks..."Don't get your boobs on my balls!" LMAO   Yeah...so we had to go at 7.30 because it's like "No Kids" time ain't it? So we walked up to Clumber street and just sat on the floor and talked for ages while we watched the mansfield scutters walked past. Still haven't thought of a name for them yet...hmm...   Then we walked down to the Chinese but it was closed =\...so then we walked up Sammy's street and the lil year 8 that I wagged school with was hanging out of her bedroom window shouting "Is that your boyfriend?"..."No!"..."Stop lyin'"..."I'm not,"...."Stop lyin'"...I was like, yeah...go back to bed!   Then we went down Titch n had a chat about Colley *spits*...then we walked to the bus station and he gave me 40p for the bus that I didn't need. Now I feel bad and I might buy him a Sausage Roll to make up for it =P   Yeeey! This has been like the best birthday EVER! Okay...gonna go and be 16 now, mwah xXx
