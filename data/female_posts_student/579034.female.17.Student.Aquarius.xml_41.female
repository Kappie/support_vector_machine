I stayed home with my mom and we watched "Down With Love" and anyone who's seen "Down With Love" knows that it has plenty of sexual inuendos and like my mom was "astonished" that her little girl knew what they were talking about. It was kinda funny. Then I talked to Urcinoli and now I'm watching "Panic Room" for about that 100th time. But oh well, it's the only good thing on HBO. So yea, I downloaded this song called "This Will Be", it's the one where its like "This will be, an ever lasting love..." and I was listening to it and it sounded like a pretty good wedding song. Like, when I get married I don't want a slow "I love you, your beautiful" song, those are so old. I want something thats upbeat and perky! Ya know? Like, I don't want it to be slow. Cause I mean, I dunno I just don't. I think thats a really good one. I'll have to keep it in mind for that day lol. Wow, how sad I'm not even 17 yet and I'm planning my wedding lol. Well I think every girl does that. I mean, it's like one of the biggest days in a girls life, and I guess a guys too but I don't know how many guys sit there and think about their tux ya no? So yea, I'm bored.... very bored.... hummm, what's on my mind that I could talk about.......... OH! I saw Brian, from Notre Dame track camp, the one from Fordham at the meet today, he hurt his toe but I talked to him for a bit.... I offerd him and some of his teammates munchkins but they never came to get any.... oh well tuff for them... I bought a big bucket of munchkins for the team today, and we got Trish some ice cream cause it was her birthday today. HAPPY BIRTHDAY TRISH!!!! Okay, yea.. that's enough. For anyone who read this, hats off to you! x0x
