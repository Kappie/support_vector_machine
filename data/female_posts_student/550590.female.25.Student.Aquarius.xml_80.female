Sad because it's a beauty pagaent gone terribly awry, and yet, so much like a train wreck--you can't help but watch (I knew giving up tv for lent was a good thing.)  It's like a higher class version of Elimidate (like that's difficult) meets that terrible, terrible disaster known as Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire.  Ugh.  I can't wait to go to D.C. where there's actually real people with whom I have intelligent conversations whilst surrounded by buildings of history and culture.  Sigh...3 days and counting.  The work week brings with it such stress and self-pity lately.    Somehow it finally hit Jason that I have been stressed out beyond belief over the conference this weekend.  I was kind of like, "duh"...just because I was too busy trying to make all our tourism arrangements by myself while he did God knows what in his office.  He seems genuinely concerned this week, but it's just too late at this point.  I've made the decision to leave, and I have to stick with it.  If I don't do it now, I never will, right?  Some words of encouragement would be nice though (hint, hint).
