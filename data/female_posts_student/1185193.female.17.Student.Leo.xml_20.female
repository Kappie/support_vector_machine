So I did janitor work for an hour, walking around the whole school with other deliquents picking up trash.  Those who know me on campus gasped when they saw me with plastic gloves and a trash bag.  Megan Reuter got detention?  As Erin said, "What a bad seed."  I prefer to think of myself as a good seed with a couple dead leaves on the stem.  I finish my detention on Thursday after school.  Yipee!  Get this.  Out of my three classes, I have 4 essays in the making.  Isn't that ridiculous?  Plus, an in-class Spanish essay on Thursday.  Thursday is going to suck.  Who knows?  Friday might suck even more.  I have my follow up doctor's appt. re: my thyroid.  Let ya'll know how that goes l8tr.
