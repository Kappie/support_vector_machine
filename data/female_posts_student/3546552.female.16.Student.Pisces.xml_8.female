Don't tell, but, I got to drive the hour and a half there, and back (that would be illegal for any of the following, I'm not 25 therefore I cannot drive a rented car, I have only had my license for a little over 3 months therefore I cannot drive two people, and I was speeding like crazy!) so, yeah, the beach was amazing, the waves were very refreshing, huge, and...well, salty (like literally) but anyway, I have never seen anything more beautiful in my life! We went to Ron Jon's surf shop where I bought a t-shirt and Michelle got a skirt! That place is ENORMOUS with swimsuits lining the walls and surfboards gallore! After that, it was back to driving "home" where we were to meet up with Jan, one of the other ladies we went with, and her daughter. When we got home, they were sleeping instead of waiting for us to go to MGM with them, so we packed our things for tomorrow, then, we all went to Downtown Disney which was kind of cool with the LEGO store, however the rest was pretty expensive and rather boring. So anyway, like, an hour after we got there, Jan decided to leave, so we stayed a little longer, but that...I guess wasn't quite what she had in mind. So, when we got home, she was all angry and stupid and wouldn't give us the time of day. ARG! Brip brip brip she brip brip brip that brip brippin brip (ask me later M.R.). ANYWAY...we went in our pool for awhile, and swam with her demon posessed child...yeah, (she growls at us and her favorite word is doogie...(or however you spell that)so draw what conclusions you may. Now, we are eating spaghetti, in our room and are about to go skinny dipping! Hope you are all well and I will see you soon! love you bbye! ~kendra
