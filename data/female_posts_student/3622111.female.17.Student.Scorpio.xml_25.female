Go download. ;)  Well, I'm just thinking we should stop with the short comments. It's better to make them into entries... Yes? Hm.  My mom got me the Da Vinci Code from Canada. I kinda like it coz it's a hardcover version... but actually feel strange when everyone else are reading the bookcover version. =P Oh well. I'm almost done with Chapter 9. Mary... I'm going to catch up with you soon enough. Hehe.  Feel that I'm having a burnout. I don't have any appetite for anything. Everything seems boring. I mean, you gotta realize I'm having a problem when the notion of playing games like Hexic, Texttwist or the likes become boring to me.  Wei said it might be my hormones... well. Perhaps. I  am  having my period these few days, but it's most probably not the major factor. I mean, I've been like this for more than a couple of days. I think it's coz I've been so stressed for the past few months, what with my head prefect duties, SAT tests, university applications and final exams, all one after another. I didn't even get a proper break during Easter.  Step... at least you can always escape to Hong Kong. I don't have that privilege. --"
