However, I have had a chance to go back through some of them and listen to some songs I like but haven't listened to in a long time.  A few thoughts:  Lauryn Hill has one of the best voices in the industry. The Dropkick Murphys are a band I would like to party with some day. Whatever happened to Oasis? GOB has definitely gone a little to "pop-punk" for me. No Doubt's  Tragic Kingdom  was rad. The Black crows'  Shake Your Moneymaker  is pretty damn awesome. Alanis Morissette's debut album was her best. Sarah McLachlan makes me cry. I hate all those Now (1- what are we at now...19 or something) albums. Mr. Marley is King. Nobody can do what Nirvana did. Live was better 10 years ago. Ani DiFranco is cool but I get a headache if I listen to her for a long time. The Spice Girls a definite guilty pleasure. Does it get any better than "Stop Right now?" No, no I don't think so.  A while ago I was asked a question that has really bothered me since then.  It is a very simple and unassuming question.  One of those "conversation starters" if you will.  I am sure the lady who asked me the question didn't mean anything by it and she would feel really bad if she found out that it has been plaguing me all this time.  "So, Sam, what do you do?"  That's it...that is the question.  That fucking question.  What do you do.  What do you do.  I told her I was a high school student looking for a job.  But...therein lies the problem, that is not what I do.  I don't know what the hell I do.  I go to school, but that isn't what I  do .  Some people can answer that question with no hesitation because they do something.  They travel the world.  Write books. Help the needy.  Save animals.  Protect rain forests.  Paint pictures. Run marathons.  Anything.  I don't do any of that.  I mean, Jesus, talk about a buzz kill.  Does anyone else feel this way?  Meaning the feeling of being a complete failure at...life.  I should do something...I really really want to do something, anything.  But I don't know what or where to start or how.  The best answer I can come up with right now is that I survive.  That is what I do.  I have survived whatever has come at me in these 17 years the best way I know how.  And a lot has come at me, death, despair, failure, success, sadness, rejection, love, hate, happiness, injustice, inadequacy, depression, angst. Maybe it's human nature to survive but maybe not.  I think that some of us are more well suited to do it than others, I would like to think I am included in the first group.  I guess we'll see how screwed up I am later in life.  By all accounts I should be pretty screwed up, however I don't think I will be.  Wishful thinking?  Maybe, but I don't think so.
