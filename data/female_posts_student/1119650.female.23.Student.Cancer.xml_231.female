Lately I've just been writing absolutely inane things, but I don't want to bore people with the remedial details of my life.  I do like to let you all in from time to time, and get your opinions, but I don't really know what I have this blog for.  Sometimes its big ranting and outpourings of feelings, sometimes its just a place to collect the smattering of ideas that run through my head so I don't forget things (being that I have a mind like a seive thats quite easy).  I vow to you all, my dear, dear readers, my blog will get better as it has been "teh suck" lately.    I think its interesting to me to look back on my earliest entries and say to myself, "God, that seems so long ago" though its only been a matter of a few months.  I can't wait until this blog is a year old and I can look back and it will really have been a while ago.    The other thing that bothers me, and perhaps I'll have to change this, is the fact that although this is MY blog, and my own personal space, I cant be completely honest here, nor can I divulge all the detals of my life.  You see, there are some people reading this blog who I am not entirely honest with.  That is not to say that I'm lying to them, but they just don't know ALL the situations in my life...and they can't, because that would cause some serious ruckus.  To me its better to revel in my own little happinesses and disappointments concerning those "unspoken situations" than to share them all, but beleive me I wish I could share them.  Its not that they'd make the blog any more thrilling, I just wish I had somewhere to record this all for reflection...I guess I'll have to save my personal "paper" journal for that.
