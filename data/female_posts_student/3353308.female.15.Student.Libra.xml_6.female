Sandy is finally home which makes things ten times better  - even if I am really jealous of her not having school. I wish I could stay home and take naps! Anyway, this Flrio guy came to our school - I don't know how he ever became governor. It was like he wasn't human or something. If you asked him a question his mouth just opened and all this garbled stuff came out without any of it meaning anything really. Reason number one I would never be a politician. I mean, why can't there just be normal people up there? Yes yes, I know they wouldn't get elected b/c no one likes to face the truth - but hey, lie to me up front, not behind my back in jumbled words which really don't make sense together
