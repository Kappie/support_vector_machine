Like yourself I was going to mention Tarantino but not discuss him because his creativity goes without saying.  The second name I will add to that category is Charlie Kaufman (please don't groan saying 'Here she goes again!')  Whether you love him or hate him there's no denying Kaufman is one of the most creative people working today and I will leave it at that.  I was going to save television for last because as I was canvassing popular culture for creativity I kept coming back to TV.  But since you've gone there I will dutifully follow.  About television- 90% of it is complete and total crap, but in my estimation that other 10% is the most creative block in all of entertainment.   I'm surprised you sited  Nip/Tuck  as one of the three most creative shows on television.  Like yourself I am a fan, but I find the series to be more intriguing than creative.  Let me explain that- I think there are shows on TV that are more creative than  Nip/Tuck  but I would be hard pressed to name a show that is more intriguing.  As to  The Shield  I have never seen it so I will take your word.  As to your reality TV critique I agree, not only for being unoriginal but so repetitive.  Reality shows, by their very nature are mean spirited, it's all about who's getting kicked/fired/voted off.  Yes The Sopranos and Deadwood are dark shows, but they offer an insight into why we do the mean, cold, calculated things we do. Reality TV is suppose to make us feel better about ourselves by watching people who are pettier or uglier than us but it has the opposite effect- it makes me sad it's come to this.  The reason I loved the first season of  American Idol  was because the contestants weren't out to beat each other (I became disillusioned with the show when they took Kelly Clarkson, a white girl who can sing the blues like no one's business, and mad her into a Christina Auguliera wannabe.)  Enough of who doesn't have it, lets get to who does.   Arrested Development  is a wacky, out of left field gem that is as silly as it is sweet.  The unconventional plodding and design of the show (shot like  Sports Night  with a single camera)add to its charm.  The show zigs and zags unlike traditional sitcoms so not every storyline is wrapped up in a single episode.   Arrested Development  never goes for the cheap laughs and it's outlandish storylines including my favorite when Jason Bateman uses a boat full of male strippers dressed as policeman to teach his son a lesson about drugs, are always redeemed by playing for the heart.  My second bastion of original creativity is Comedy Central. When comprising my list the first thing that popped into my mind was  The Daily Show .  Four nights a week Jon Stewart and his gang deliver the wittiest most astute commentary around.  It doesn't matter what's going on in the news, they have as much fun with the Oscars as they do with Iraq.  Stephen Colbert is a national treasure but the rest of the gang, Ed Helmes, Rob Couldrey, Lewis Black, are no slouches either.  If one's going to include  The Daily Show , you have to count  The Chappelle Show  as well.  And  Reno 911 .  And  South Park .  In my mind no network, not even the slumping HBO, can rival the amount of uninhibited, original programming Comedy Central is putting on the air.  My post has run long so I'll save my beacon of creativity and remaining thoughts on television for next time.
