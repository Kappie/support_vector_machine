Remember this, people; Breathe out when you hit the floor.  Aside from that, I have 4 exams left, Namely RE, Science, History, and RE. Damn catholic schools. My last exam is a week on tuesday, and I will slap anyone who takes the piss because they finished before me.  Wow, three sections to this post. I am going to see Jamie Cullum live at the pavillions a week on Friday. He is so good. (I will also slap anyone who takes the piss out of Jamie Cullum.) Then my exams finish on tuesday, and it's time for me to go sailing, everyday, 9-5. While you damn As people are still in school.  HAHA . Apologies to Vicky, That laugh was mainly aimed at Bri. Even though she was actually quite sympathetic last night when I told her Dave almost killed me. So, I am sorry. I take back that laugh. It was nasty. Bad Rob...
