So, I recreated Koala Peace, my first blog on this site which I deleted a couple of months ago or so... Anyways, there will be no mentions of my weight, my Camp, my school, or my EBGF... Well, at least I don't think there will be... I can't really control what my future self will do in the future...    I don't really understand my life right now. Everything is just so confusing. I mean, sometimes, there are a hundred different things that run through my mind every minute it seems. Other times there are moments where it seems like I have no thoughts at all, like my mind has gone completely blank.    Whenever I can't stop thinking about something(s), I always force myself to think of something else. That something else is usually a fantasy story that I create inside my head. It's a build on story where I can make anything happen. If I'm in the I'm-So-In-Love mood, then I make the main characters or whoever, in my story, fall dramatically in love... If I'm in an angry mood I can make my characters undergo some serious, traumatizing events that will make them cry their eyes out. It may sound incredibly weird or whatever but it makes me feel better.    Lately I have been seriously frustrated with my love life... I know I'm only 13 years old and therefore can have no love life but I'm just going to call it that, okay? Anyhow, I don't really feel like telling you about why I'm so frustrated... Am I even making any sense? No? That's great!    Anyhow, I'm gone...
