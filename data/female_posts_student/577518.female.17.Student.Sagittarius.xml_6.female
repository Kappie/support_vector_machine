It's ok if they absent in my life, I don't need these kinda people to ruin my life. Go away go away, I don't want a  polluted friendship .  My eyes hurt and I can't breathe because of the haze. Ah, this is terrible, I need fresh air, please!   I forgot to thank my friends for helping me last week in the MUET tuition class. I vomited at the class, and they helped me to clean the disgusting  stuff . Here's the list: thanks to Kah Boon, Li Min, Siew Peng, Lit Yee, Shue Ling and Nian Tze. You guys let me know that I am not alone. And to my MUET tuition teacher, mdm Ho, sorry for interrupting the class,  I wanted run to the toilet, but I couldn't make it, I just cannot control myself.   I'm better now, just need to eat less, cuz I will vomit if I'm  overload .   Still need to finish a lot of homework, but I enjoy it. Going to math. tuition later, that's all for today ;)
