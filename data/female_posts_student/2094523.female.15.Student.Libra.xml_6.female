Im sure everyone finds flaws within every human being yet people never seem to find flaws within themselves. you know why? its coz we're stupid stupid people. coz whaever bad happens in the world we lay the blame on someone else. i mean its ALWAYS someone elses fault but never ours huh? indeed we are human on the outside bitches on the inside.
