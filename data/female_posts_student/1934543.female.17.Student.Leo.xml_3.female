None of the movies I have ever heard of and the only thing that I stop at is the soccer channel with games that I saw about a million times already. Why don't these Hollywood buttheads tape their movies faster so that there is more good stuff to watch on TV. So the only thing i am doing apart from zapping right now is talking to some people from back over at the midwest and the person i am really waiting for aint coming on and i sure hope that that person will come on really quick. I know it is early but i am already really tired. Watching TV and eating the whole day makes everyone really tired. But on the other hand i am on break, so i can sleep tommorrow :-) For now i am still hoping for that person to come online and then we will see!
