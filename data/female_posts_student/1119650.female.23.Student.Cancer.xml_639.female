Okay so the  urlLink UConn  men are the NCAA Champs, now we just have to see if the Ladies can beat Tennessee tonight (a much tougher opponent than Georgia Tech), to make the goold old UC the first team in NCAA history to have the men and women as champions in the same year.    If they're already  urlLink rioting now , imagine what would happen if the ladies  do  win...
