Took lots of pics with lots of ppl, shall update when i find that damn USB cable.  Its been missing since the last time i used it. I was freaking bored yesterday. In the end, I didn't turn up for class outing yesterday. Sorry guys.. ...  ... Where are you? Just where are you? Grrr.. I shall not get paranoid here.  I miss you.  I haven eaten anything from last night till now, and the weird thing is Im not feeling hungry at all.  Ok, this is totally outta the picture. Im off to get MC to shut that Mr. Chong's mouth. The last time I ponned sch was like last wednesday. Oh well, as you can see the older you grow the more you hate sch. Yes, HATE! To all those muggers in sch: Enjoy ur day at school while I rot my butt at home. :P Slacking.  I shall stop slacking. I'll try. I will. Really. -nods vigourously-
