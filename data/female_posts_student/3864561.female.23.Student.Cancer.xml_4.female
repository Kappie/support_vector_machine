USELESS INFO THAT REALLY WON'T INTEREST ANYONE BUT ME: my baby is now approximately 25cm long and weighs just under 1lb. It can touch, hear, smell and taste. As well as being able to move its limbs (including fingers and toes) it can also open and close its eyes, swallow, hiccup and yawn. Over the next couple of weeks it will start to recognise my voice, and will be able to smile, frown and cry.  On the off-chance you ARE interested, you can find some pretty cool 3-D ultrasound photos  here . (Not of my baby, of course. Of random inferior ones.)
