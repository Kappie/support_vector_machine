Ed's coming over tomorrow, that should be interesting, lol. We might go out to lunch, we might not. Whatever.   My parents can never know, lol, or I will be shot in the ass for it. They'll kill me.   But I don't really care, he's MY friend, not theirs.   Hmmm, I kinda wanna go for a walk. I wonder if they turned on the alarm yet or not.   I just wanna be alone with the sky. I like feeling small. It's as if all my problems are nothing, compared to that sky that I love to stare at. I'm just a small, miniscule particle compared to it. I want to feel like that, maybe it'll make me feel better. I just need to clear my head. Lay out under the stars and just breathe the night air...and know that there  can  be peace, and there  can be a break from the spinning my mind has been doing.   I don't really know why I feel this way.   I am a fucked up individual. I fill my life with unnecessary stresses and discontent...but for what reason? I always feel as though I am meant to fail, and I am not good enough to succeed.   I want to hurt myself. I want to feel pain. But why?!  It's like my life thrives on the shit you're supposed to hate.  Fuck. I can't find my scissors.
