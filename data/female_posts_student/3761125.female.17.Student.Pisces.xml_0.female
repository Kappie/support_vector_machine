Elmer, observing developments in a hand mirror, is elated.  Petals pop forth.  No! That wasn't hair tonic, it was fertilizer! The kind that grows flowers on scalps! Now Elmer is very, very angry and reaches into the back of his shirt, where he has been keeping his musket the whole time.  How clever of him to have armed himself for his barber's appointment.  But I know what's coming.  In the next thirty seconds, Bugs will momentarily baffle him by dashing out of the scene, returning dressed as a girl (a girl bunny, though), and giving Elmer flowers and candy, thus wowing Elmer and causing him to present Bugs with a wedding ring, which in turn will inspire Bugs to don wedding regalia.  Bugs and Elmer will find a minister and say their vows, but Bugs will carry Elmer up a stairway to their honeymoon suite, which of course will not be a suite at all but just a door leading into empty space.  Bugs, lifting Elmer over the threshold, will then drop him to a nasty and violent death, which is really not very fair treatment for a guy who has just made a serious commitment to you despite the obvious hurdles involved in an interspecies marriage between a homosexual gun nut and a transvestite anthropomorphic rodent who barely know eachother, at least within the context of this cartoon.  That's marriage for you, folks.  Who needs it?
