Just had lunch and realized that cup noodles really taste different from packet noodles. I had Korean noodles and felt so fat and sick. I actually wanted to slim down but now I only managed to bleach my hair and ya, I only really managed to bleach my hair... *Geezzz* Must go and save up money to purchase Shirou/Lucas....
