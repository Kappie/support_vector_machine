"what do you want to know then?" the fortune-teller persisted, fishing for some potential weakness in her prey. um, the future? "$20 covers past present AND future," she said, like only a dumbass would pass up on such a great deal. "er...we'll, um, think about it and come back," i, the dumbass, responded. and just as i was about to follow jyk out the door, the gypsy woman caught my eyes and said, "i can already see that there are two ppl for you: one from your past and one from your present!"   well, that did it for me brother. 1 past + 1 present => 2 future?? what a bunch of bologna! it was quite obvious to me that the lady earned her living as a thick-skinned charlatan, and i walked away not planning to give the meeting a second thought.  so that was last thursday. i've not only NOT been able to sleep until the crack of dawn since saturday, but have also been bombarded by the most disturbing feelings/thoughts and dreams. not that i believe in any of that stuff, but...do you think the gypsy cursed me?? i knew that she knew that i was lying when i said that we were gonna go back. and she didn't look so happy when we turned to go, noooo she didn't....  have you guys seen that stephen king movie "thinner"?? 'member that old man with the gi-normous [moooooooooooooleymoooooooooooooley]mole?? *shudder* anyway, my point is, mad gypsies = no good.  alright ppl. i initally wrote this entry for your entertainment and cuz i couldn't sleep but now i'm really scaring myself cuz i'm a big chicken. so the moral of today's story is to not hang out with  urlLink jyk . i go to bed now. buhbye.
