Then I foudn this guy named Ben who is going to be in the Improvathon!!!!!! He seems really funny..which scares me. I wish I was more funny!  But I have a secret weapon...  well two acctualy...MWA HAHHAHA!!  My first weapon is our uniforms. Oh my goodness. We look like freaks. It's the BEST thing ever. See, people will think we look funny then laugh at us then the judges will be like "wow, they are funy! First prize! First prize!"  My second weapon is...see I am really shy just around people but when I get on the stage I am like BOOOOOOOM. and everyone is like "Wow!"  You know it.  Wow.  I am so nervous for the improvathon, I am like shaking and it's not till SATURDAY.  You all better say a prayer for me. Saturday, 3 o'clock.  Wow.   Part of me can't wait...  but another part of me is so freaked out I am going to die.   Hmm.... :)  an odd mix, eh?
