WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD Louis Armstrong  I see trees of green, red roses too I see them bloom for me and you And I think to myself what a wonderful world.  I see skies of blue and clouds of white The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night And I think to myself what a wonderful world.  The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky Are also on the faces of people going by I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do They're really saying I love you.  I hear babies crying, I watch them grow They'll learn much more than I'll never know And I think to myself what a wonderful world Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world.   what a happy song. if i could live in a song, i would live in that one. i think the john lennon song is so sad to me, not because of the lyrics but because margaret loves the beatles so much. and it brings back like a silent video of memories with that song playing, and i know this sounds way cheesy, but it's what's going on in my head right now. so bear with me. i think this summer will be a mucho mais bueno growing experience. zeut allors. je ne comprend pas ma vie. allors, je veux dormir parce que je suis tres fatiguee. bon nuit.  what a wonderful world
