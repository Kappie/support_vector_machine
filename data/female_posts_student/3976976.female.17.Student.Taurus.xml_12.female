My family came in and my new house mate/ "twin" has finally come to set in for 6 months or so... the trouble and mischievous things that i know somehow we will get into.. but i guess thats a good thing.. an exciting story to tell.. drinking.. partying.. that at comes in the package of my "twin"...... oh and womanizer at that.. got a girl of his own... but he doesnt care.. hes in love with american women.. well just the way they dance.. haha dirty dancin! Okay well he just updated doesnt have a girl.. hmm i wonder why?? WOMANIZER! I'm tellin you.. the day he actually settles down.. will be the day.. haha that i get a man! haha.. that'll be A LONG time! Wow... im ramblin on and on about nothing because that is exactly what gone on today.. oh and the fact that i am watchin everyone who comes into these doors loose their money in a card game.. quite entertaining.. a mexican family and a gay guy.. no one exaclty knows what is goin on.. i just here giggles .... they are drunk while being sober! just because they are laughin about cards.. i guess i would get it if i played but i dont.. i dont play cards.. im afraid to loose money.. money i definately dont have... Why does everything have to do about money.. if you aint got money.. well you cant do shit! Isnt that fucked up.. what happened to the days that you could be entertained without money! UH! oh well i guess thats life.. Fucked up and out to take every down to the shithole! oh what joy! well i dont know what the fuck to say so Im out!
