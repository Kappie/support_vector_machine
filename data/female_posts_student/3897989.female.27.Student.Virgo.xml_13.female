It's perfect because we'll be done with finals Thurs. It's meant to be. That would be a great birthday present to myself since my birthday's on the 1st day of Sept.! Delayed celebration. I have a lot to celebrate besides my birthday.  I will miss being out of school for 3 weeks. Just more work I can do.  Night,  BLG
