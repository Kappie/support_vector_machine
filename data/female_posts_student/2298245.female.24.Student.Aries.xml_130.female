Looking forward to getting outside in a bit, on a quest for food.  The cold air should wake me up, but the food will probably have the opposite effect.  Oh well.  Perhaps I will just stay as tired as I am now, the future adventures cancelling each other out.  I'm almost done with reading my assignment, which means surfing time is here soon...
