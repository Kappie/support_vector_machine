My aunt, uncle, and cousin were here from Georgia so we went with them to Santa Cruz to go to this marine laboratory that's just past Natural Bridges.  We were out on the cliff that over looks the ocean (its about 40 feet above the ocean) and my little sister is throwing and kicking rocks into the water below.  She kicks a rock and her shoe flies off her foot, landing 40 feet below in the ocean.  At first we could see the shoe but then a wave comes in and pushes the shoe even farther under the cliff and to add to that, its not possible to go down onto the beach.  Her shoe that she got about a month ago is now lost to the ocean.  Only her right foot too.  So we drove into Santa Cruz and bought her another pair of shoes.  It was hella funny.  She considered trying to climb down the cliff to get it and then the wave came.  So we bought her a pair of converse that are really cool.  They are blue high tops with light blue stitching and are light blue on the inside.  So she left for Santa Cruz with a pair of shoes and came back with three shoes.  We hassled her the rest of the time about losing her shoe. Poor poor little nikki!
