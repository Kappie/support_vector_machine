I didn't even start my homework yet!  here's what I've been doing since I came home from school.  got home!  was SOOOO tired.  so I slept!  =)  easy solution.  mother got home.  didn't want to eat.  slept some more.  mother and brother went out to eat.  brought me back food.  =)  dad came home.  said to my mom, "let's go shopping!"  (my mom wants a new purse.  the purse she wants is $700.  I was like WHOA why don't you just get this happy pink purse for $15?  she said no, it's too teenagerish and tacky.)  so I was like, can I go along? I didn't do any hw yet, but pleeeaaase?  and they were like eh okay sure why not.  so we went shopping!  at stonebriar AND willow bend.  mom found out purse too expensive.  then she found these coupons that she had for bath and body works!  one of then was get a free lotion thing with the purchase of anything in the store. another one was get $10 off if you spent more than $35, or get $15 off when you spend more than $50. then there was this in store thing where if you buy 3 things, you get a fourth one free. and another in store offer of when you spend $35, you can get a $24 satchel thing for $5.  so what did we do?  why, we combined all those offers, of course!  we got SUCH a nice clerk person.  =)  first my mom was going for the $10 off $35 purchase thing.  so we got these two cotton blossom things.  and then I got a sheer freesia lotion thing!  =)  then the clerk was like =O if you get one more thing, you can get another free!  (for the buy 3 get 1 free thing.)  so my mom was like, eh, sure, whatever.  yang, go pick out two more things.  so I got the cotton blossom lotion and a cotton blossom body spray.  then the lady was like you got more thatn $35 worth of stuff, do you want a satchel for $5?  and my mom was like okay sure whatever.  then the clerk was like you're almost at $50!  if you get some more stuff, you can get $15 off!  so my mom was like o__O oookay then.  so then we got a cotton blossom soap.  -_____-  so in the end, we spent $37 and got over $70 worth of stuff.  -_______-  and I did no homework!  puahahaha.  =D
