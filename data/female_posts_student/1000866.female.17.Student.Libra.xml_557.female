That's no fun. I think I'm just going to do a little bit of it tonight though. Just stuff I really need to get done.   It's weird. It almost feels like I'm going to the first day of school tomorrow. Crazy. My record was broken because my internet connection was stupid but I definitely did manage to stay online for over 11 days straight. Crazyness. That's actually a pretty good internet connection if it's able to stay connected for over 11 days. And now...on to laundry. Um, yay?
