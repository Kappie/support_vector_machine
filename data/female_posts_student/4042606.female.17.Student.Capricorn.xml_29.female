Although at timesAnchorman feels like an extended "Saturday Night Live" sketch from the show's treasure chest of Will Ferrell characters, co-writers Will Ferrell and Adam McKaycreated enough inspiredinsanity to sail past thestupid stretches andgivea welcome splash of funny kickass movie-tude.    This would be the first  Alright Alright  review. I hope you got something from this short short. I didn't want to blow all my creativity on one review!
