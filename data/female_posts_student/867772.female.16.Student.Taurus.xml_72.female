You have a life. Sure, a different one than mine, but definitley, in no way worse. You're a beautiful fourteen-year-old girl with boys all over her and the best part is that you don't care. Because you have a boyfriend. One that you love to death, who loves you to death. Drew's different from any other guy you've dated. I have great expectations for you two (Oh fuck, the book got to my head. I didn't just say that...).  You have plenty to write about, just BE YOURSELF. Be the Cassie we all love.  Regarding the whole feeling-left-out thing, I'm happy you said all the shit you did, because it's not shit. I can see how this might piss you off, and you have every right to be pissed off. I never want to make you feel left out, and now that I know why you are, I'll do everything I can to fix it.  Luv ya girl, The Llama
