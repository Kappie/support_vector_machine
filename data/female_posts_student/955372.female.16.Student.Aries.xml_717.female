First, am scrapping the Travel blog, as a) no one reads it and b) it's a pain in the ass to write in, Second, am adding an "Allie IS..." page. Where there will be several pictures of me as different people. As soon as I get this last roll of film developed. It is inspired by that "Allie IS Malibu Barbie" picture.
