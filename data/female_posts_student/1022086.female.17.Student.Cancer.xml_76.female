It went a lot better than I  had even hoped!! I made a 100 in AP Chem for the semester and therefore the year *insert really huge smiley here* and a 100 in AP Quackulus for the nine weeks and semester and year, which was MOST CERTAINLY UNEXPECTED!!!!!! I'm so satisfied!!! Of course that crap class of Coach Morris's gave an A but not a 100 though it was such an easy class, but it hopefully won't have altered my GPA nor rank too much *crosses fingers and knocks on wood*. I guess we will see when I go back to school and need my transcript for colleges, eh?   Nonetheless, I'm really pleased. I feel like I've worked hard this year, and I got the results I worked for.   Today I spent time with Sela for the first time in virtually three years, and it was really good and fun. I think I might have tanned a bit, too, which is a yay as I was pretty pale. This summer has been odd in the sense that I'm not getting much done thus far; I always say to myself that I'll get things done, and then people call me complaining that I haven't done anything with them all year and I more than gladly admit that they're right and do stuff. Don't get me wrong, I'm loving it because I missed seeing my friends and having a life, but I really should start trying a little harder to get things I need to get done done. On that note, I'm going to go clean my room a little... maybe...
