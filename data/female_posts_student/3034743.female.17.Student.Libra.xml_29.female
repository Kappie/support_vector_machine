We watched Gothika and I schooled him in 80s music. I'm talking to Josh right now, and he just shared some really interesting information with me. hmm...makes me think. Lets see what else has gone on...oh...I know! I freakin got excluded from Friday Night Movie Night! Whatever....no, I'm kidding. I understand the story. (It's ok Alex...haha). Tomorrow Erin is going to come over and we are going to work on homework. We are so cool! haha. We always have fun together tho, so that is good. I really don't have too much more to blog about, so I'll stop for now.
