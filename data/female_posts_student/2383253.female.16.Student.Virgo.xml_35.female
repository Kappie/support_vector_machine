I found it sad that I didn't know of the places that the people were from...not even their schools. San Diego is such a big place. We should go exploring more. Damn I slept so much yesterday night. I think the beach tired me out or something cause I was out cold until 11 in the morning. I'm gonna go make some iced tea. Catch ya later.
