And wait 'till I've made a purdy layout for this blog, then it'll be really great ^_^ I'm also working on a new layout for my website, but no spoilers yet ^_^ ---- Anyway, today was a fun day. First I got to sleep for half an hour more, because I had an opticians appointment. Apparently my eyes are getting better, my perscription's gone down :) And then I took the AP German exam today, which I had totally forgotten about. Thank god they came to find me XD It was easy though, except my spelling was probably completely wonky, but no worries, eh? Worries about my AP Euro exam tomorow, though. So much information to keep in my head *hides under bed*  Alero's just arrived gotta go ^_^
