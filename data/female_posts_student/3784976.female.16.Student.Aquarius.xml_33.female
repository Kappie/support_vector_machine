So we went on another one, but they didn't tell me until we got to the gates that you stood up on it.  I freaked out, but i did survive it.  Later, they were starting up the dragster so Heather and I decided to get in line, but no one else wanted to because Kayla said it would take, "To long!"  It only took us 30 minutes and we were on it.  I was freaked out about that too, but when I was done, I couldn't believe how much fun it was!!  And later, we all went, and I rode in the very front row!!!  My eyes started to water because of the force.  You know what was the best part?  The part where everyone but Heather and I decided to go on the water ride, and they didn't ask us first.  Ya, we got soaked.  So then Heather and Kayla and I stood in line for an hour and a half, just to go on the Millenium Force!  But it was worth every second.  At the end of the night, we split up and Heather, Jared and I all went on the Rip Cord.  I loved it.  It was like nothing I had ever experieced before!!!!  I screamed so loud.   But then on our way back we saw the dragster and thought it would be cool to go on it at night.  So we went and got in line, which took about 30 minutes.  Well we thought that the others might still be doing some of the other rollercoaster.  But just in case they weren't, we made up a lie to tell them so they wouldn't get mad.  We told them that I got sick on the way to do the rip cord, so we had to wait a little while, and that on the way back we had to stop at all the bathrooms, because I really thought I would throw up again!!!!   Well they found out the truth today, and let me just say, they were pretty mad!!   But you know what?  I would have done it again.  It was so awesome to be sitting there, going straight towards the ground at 120 mph, and be able to see the whole park with the lights on!  I want to go back!!   And the night before, Kayla and I went and stayed with Heather at their lake house, and we only got 1.5 hours of sleep.  Well, not Heather!  And then we didn't get back until 2:15 last night, so I selpt in until 12:51 today.  It was great!  Well I got to go to bed now, so I will right more tomorrow!
