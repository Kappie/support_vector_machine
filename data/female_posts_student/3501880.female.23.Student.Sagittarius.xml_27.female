This mishap occurred one day as I happened to be browsing the personal ads on Match.com and spotted what I thought could be my potential soulmate (two words: "bowtie" and "porn"). After long sessions of whining to my friends ("But he's ppppeeeerrrrrfect for me!"), I took a deep breath and paid the $25 subscription so I could email him. Alas, he never responded to my perfectly-crafted email that I spent hours writing (I am thinking of sending him a bill through paypal for the subscription fee). However, this is not the story of my recent failures of internet dating. Instead, I take you all the way back to 1998 in Logan, Utah to spin a tale of lust, yearning, desire, and well, stalking and lunancy, too.  Ladies and Gentlemen, I give to you... First Bass   During the Spring of my freshman year at Utah State, the school sponsored an event called, "Poetry and a Beverage". My friend, Jo, invited me to go see her brother's new band play at the event (so really, it should have been called "concert and a beverage").    The band took the stage, and my eyes drifted to the bass player. Angelic music floated down from the heavens as cherubs danced sprightly around him. Like my own bass-playing, causasian, rhythm-lacking Rickie Martin! I leaned over to Jo and asked if his name was Jesus, because I was in heaven (okay, not really).  During one of the breaks, I kept my eyes focused on Christ...I mean, Chris...his name was Chris, and noticed him speaking with a girl in the crowd. Not just talking, but I notice he had been, you know...leaning. I made a photographic image of this girl and burned it into my brain so I could kill and destroy later. As I did this, I noticed Chris writing something on her hand, and then added a mental note to torture her a little before killing her. hee.  The concert continued, as I switched back and forth between undressing Chris with my eyes and giving that bitch in the crowd the death stare. Following the concert, the gang gathered at Village Inn for a late night snack and what do you know...that fucking bitch popped up in the seat across from me. Noticeably scrawled across her hand had been a phone number and the letters C-H-R-I-S.  So naturally, I memorized it and stored it right next to my Death List Five.   The next day, I whined to my roommates about how great Chris had been ("But he's pppeeeerrrrrfect for me!")and confessed that I had memorized his number off that hussy's hand. My roommate, Melanie, at the time worked for a telephone survey company, so we concocted a plan in which she would call his number and pretend that she wanted to give him a "survey". In this "survey," she would slyly inquire what it "means" to if a guy writes his number on a girl's hand....flawless, right? Well, no, becuase it turns out that after about 5 minutes, Melanie revealed the real reason behind the phone, and then I got on the phone to speak to him. The conversation went surprisingly well. (He was a history major, like me. He was a military brat, like me. He had a cock, not like me.)In the end, we arranged to meet at his band practice the next week.  The week leading up to our "date" I spent in full-throttle obsessing. I could hardly eat. I could hardly say anything that did not pertain to either Chris or our date. To say the least, I thoroughly annoyed everyone.   Finally, the big day arrived. I arrived with Jo and her brother at band practice. Chris hadn't appeared yet, so I made myself comfortable on the couch and practiced my "effortlessly sexy" look. Five minutes later, he still had not arrived. Thirty minutes later, I thought he must have just been running really late. The night dragged on, and after two hours of band practice, it dawned on me that Chris had stood me up...at his OWN band practice. I tried to maintain a dignified demeanor, but it had been clear to everyone that I was embarassed and crestfallen.  Now, at this point, a normal person would probably chalk the date up to a loss, and move on. However, I am not a normal person. I still obsessed about Chris. Why didn't he show? He must have been really sick. Or in a car crash. Or, possibly, dead!   A month passed with no word or explanation as to what exactly did happen to Chris. One day, while lounging around at Jo's apartment, she received a phone call. She kept shooting me glances and it soon became apparent that Chris occupied the other end of the line! He had gotten Jo's number from her brother and called to apologize to me. He said that he had been really sick the night we arranged to meet (I told you so!), and just hadn't gotten around to calling me. I felt nothing, but elation! Again, we arranged to meet at his next band practice, and he PROMISED that he would actually show this time.  The day arrived. I headed over to Jo's once again to prepare for the big date, and as I brushed my teeth and talked excitedly to Jo about the impending date, I accidently swallowed toothpaste. After spending the rest of my preparation time dry-heaving over the toilet, we headed off to band practice. I still felt very nauseous from a mixture of toothpaste and nerves, but I attempt to put my best foot forward. I ended up tripping. I froze up and couldn't even speak to Chris. Feeling sick and so nervous, I could only respond in mono-syllabic words when ever Chris tried to speak to me. After failing to communicate with the dumb-mute, he merely thanked me for coming to band practice and went back to strumming on his bass, and I left.  The last I heard about Chris several years later had been that he got arrested for grand theft auto and a dishonorable discharge from the Air Force. Perhaps it had been divine intervention that I swallowed that toothpaste.
