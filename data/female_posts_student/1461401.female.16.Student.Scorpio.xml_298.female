If I could say something poetic, it would be like "I tried to pretend everything was fuzzy peaches, but instead it turned out sour grapes" but that sounds kind of corny. I wrote a peom this afternoon that incorporated that idea, but it's not really good enough to type. So yeah, today wasn't that great. People seemed to be in cahoots to make me cry, and they sure did succeed. (by the end of first period...) It was weird, for a while there I was laughing. Like, after fourth period, I seemed to be ok, but once I left seventh period I sunk back down into myself. Joe was being silly during rehersal, and that helped, but joe's always silly so it wasn't anything special. "nine out of ten times our hearts just get desolved" or something like that. I'm listening to Modest Mouse (their newest cd) so I feel compelled to write down some of the lyrics. But I dunno. I think I'm gonna go do homework. Or go for a walk. Or something. I don't know. If you (the reader) want to do something, or have a suggestion, you probably know either my number or my screen name... cause yeah... I'll be here.   yeah.  If god controls the land and disease And keeps a watchful eye on me And if he is really so damn mild Well my problem is I can't see  well who would want to be, who would want to be such a control freak well who would want to be, who would want to be such a control freak
