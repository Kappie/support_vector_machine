Cause I went through the same thing but to a MUCH lesser extent and that was bad for ME. Poor Josh, he's gonna have hell catching up in school. I mean, I am. But ya know, he's not dead. Which is good. We talked on the phone and he sounded so much better. Wierd to think that the cornmaze was almost a month ago. Well I'm glad you're better Fruit-Pie.        I had to babysit for 6 hours today. I was dreading it but actually it wasn't that bad.... cause I mean, those kids are old enough to watch themselves pretty much now. And they had a Billy Joel DVD, and I had never seen his videos before. Oh my god are they a cheesefest. So 80s. But he still rocks. American songwriting at it's best. Billy's proof that you don't need a pretty face be one of the most beloved artists in American history. He just wasn't made for the video era.  Yeah so that was like 2 hours long, helped pass the time. They also just got digital cable and have thousands of channels so I watched Juwanna Mann (horrible) and the beginning of Mrs Doubtfire (love it). And I got thirty bucks! Not bad for Natalie.         Last night was Charlotte's birthday sleepover (just me and Carrie cause we're the awesomest). It was pretty cool because we didn't even watch movies we just talked.... and I like that the best. You always come away from our sleepovers knowing so much more about yourself. Lol, jk. Charlotte called me an 8 dollar whore. Haha well I didn't date the Octopus. OH BURN! Hehehe.        Well, we did watch most of Monty Python and the Holy Grail but that was much later and I fell asleep. Which is weird cause I'm such a nightowl. Still not recovered from the late night concert I guess.          I keep having weird dreams. I've had vivid dreams ever since I came back from the hospital. Do you ever have dreams that are in recurring places? I always have dreams in this old scary school with hallways that go on forever in all these different rooms, and huge twisted stairways.. and come to think of it, no windows. There are lots of people but I never talk to them. I had one of those last night.... I've had scary dreams in the school but this one was just kinda random. All I really remember was that there was a boy with a Brooklyn accent...  I can usually analyze where each part of my dreams came from. The school I have no idea. I don't believe in any deep cryptic meaning in dreams... your brain can only create what it knows. Eh oh well.
