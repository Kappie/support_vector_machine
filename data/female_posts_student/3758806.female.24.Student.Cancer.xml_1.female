Me: Thanks, so do you. Sergio: How much do you weigh now? Me: 126 Sergio:  Plus 5 pounds cause you're a liar right? Me:... Exactly. Sergio: You know, if you wanted... I bet you  would  be 126 if you started smoking... (opens his cigarette case for me) Me: No thanks.  ..... My agent is kind of a butthead, really.  Hi Sergio   :)  I haven't said butthead in years.  Other than that I had a four-hour professional communications class, a few hours at my office (had to translate a 15 page document from French to English), dinner with Crystal (at a vegetarian restaurant... I ate like a rabbit), and then I stopped by my parents house to hang out for a bit.  Of course, my Mom had "Last Comic Standing" on... It kind of annoys me that Jay Mohr introduces every single comedian with "...the very funny... so-and-so!"   .  So I went downstairs to see my brother and sister and I begged my sister to go with me to Los Angeles because I don't want to go to a stange city alone.  Marg is so much more tough than I am...  plus, I don't like to dine alone   :p    Script update:  I had Matthew (College professor, literary genius) read the first 20 pages of my script, and he is freaking out over it.  He liked my pasts scripts as well.    He loves this one, he said it's very funny but still insightful and smart.  This is remarkably encouraging news for me  :D For those of you who were interested in taking part of the July script-reading, you can reach me on my cell: 514.575.9345  It is a beautiful night out there, I'm going to enjoy it a little before I hit the sack.
