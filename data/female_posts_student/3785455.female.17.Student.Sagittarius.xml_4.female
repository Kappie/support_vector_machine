He said I was the perfect canidate, and the only reason he didn't hire me was because I don't have a drivers licence. Now, I need some help with the login behind that. If I'm not working, how the shit am I going to cough up $400.00 for the licence? Excuse me while I go blow money out my ass --  I went down town for a few hours today. Had to pick up some juice mix, cleaners, and of course freezies (its fucking hot out!). Brought that home, and then ended up going  back  down town for a few minutes. Decided I'd check out the midway, but let me tell you that was a piece of shit. Went to the grocery store after that, picked up what bit of money's worth o' groceries I could, and took a taxi home because I couldn't fanthom walking 35 minutes with 5 million pounds in food.   Today is bullshit. I need some sleep.
