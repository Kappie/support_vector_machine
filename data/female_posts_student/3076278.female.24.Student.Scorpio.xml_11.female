'nuff bitchin...   aside from the obvious reasons why liquor and drugs are banned, there is an underlying idea that makes them such a social faux pas. not being sober means that the likelyhood of us indulging our inhibitions increases. for example, imagine how many marriages have ended due to one drunken mistake. i wonder how much of our global overpopulation is caused by drunken, one-night stands. how much of our lives would be a regret if we became so...uninhibited?  i'm not saying that indulging our deepest desires is all terrible. sometimes it is something that allows us to break a barrier--to give us the nerve to say something to someone or to give us the courage to finally make that move. the things we say, however... well, that's a  different  story.   //links: the storm-/  urlLink http://www.komotv.com/stories/31777.htm
