Just the other day he held me to the ground by my neck, choking me, i even wrote a short story about, and i'll put it here. I'm so stupid.  i gave him an ultimatum, either he gets back on his meds or he loses his family, but not a chance for me to stay while he so-called does it.  If he really does his meds and all that, there is a chance we'll reconcile (in 6 months to a year), but honestly, i doubt he will do it, don't you?  i am planning to move to mocksville, not anytime soon, though. i'm going there when robbie and sheena move to Va. They are also thinking about charlotte, so i am rooting for that.  the story i wrote about what bryan did and my stupidity.... i call it  Profane Love     She was afraid. She shivered in fear. “I won’t do it.” She thought in her most stern voice.“And no one can make me.” That’s when she heard a garbled voice come from nowhere. “Gagglele gah, gah, GAH!” She turned and looked at her son. His innocent eyeslooked into hers, so trusting. His smile warmed herlike sunbeams. Then she went cold again. “I won’t do it.” The girl walked from the crib, ignoring her son’searsplitting protests. She lifted her chin and lookeddown her nose at her reflection. The bruises had gonefrom purple to a tan kind of color. She rubbed herneck softly. Even that feather touch made her wince,though from memory more than pain. Her husband had attacked her again the other night. Ithad been so long, almost six months, since he’d doneit, that she’d really begun to believe that part ofher life was over. What a joke. Here were thefootprints to prove she’d been walked on again. The argument had started over things that made nosense. He’d been angry with her for crying. He’d beenfurious that she was sad. It happened fast. One minute she was sobbing, “Whydon’t you care? Why are you angry that I’m sad?” The next moment she was sideways on the ground. Herneck was pinned to floor by his forearm. She waschoking! Breath was fading away. The dark room wasgrowing darker. Then just as suddenly the incredible pressure on herneck was gone. Her lungs were assailed with a wave ofcold air as her body took over breathinginstinctively. She was in shock. She felt like she wasfloating or dreaming awake. She heard voices. “ Oh, God. Don’t act like you were really hurt.” “I’m just afraid one day I’ll get a call from thehospital telling me you’re hurt or dead.” “He’d never do that, Mom. He wouldn’t kill me.” “I didn’t want to leave you. I just couldn’t live withHIM anymore.” “You are such a drama queen. Get off the floor.” The voices kept coming, floating through her mind andweaving together in a loose tapestry. Figures,blood-red, stood against the black garment behind hereyelids. She opened her eyes, wincing as light washedeverything around her in fuzzed outlines. She lookedforward at a map. It held on it many paths, deeplyetched into its surface. Then the image sharpened andshe stared at her reflection. Her son garbled in the background again. Her husband walked behind her, his face appearingbeside hers like a grinning ghost. Ignoring herhealing wounds, he ran his fingers over the veinpulsing in her neck. Another shiver ran up her body. Her son cried out louder. She turned and shut the door to drown the cries, then,dropping the robe on her shoulders to the floor, fellinto her profane love.
