Thank goodness they are asleep already.  Sigh...Jt online juz now and once again i hinted to him tt i haf feelings for him but he juz didnt get it. Sigh. "everyone falls for me but yet no one falls for me". Jl is freaky. He said tt day tt it was a pity tt on musical night he didnt see me for a longer time. Eeek. then there was him calling me chio...scary man. Am i chio? i'm really confused.    Then got 3 tests tmr and i cant seem to get any chinese in my head cos it's either thinking of Jt or next sat when i'm going to  urlLink library@esplanade  to accompany Jn. Sigh. Thank goodness tt day accompany him wasnt so awkward. When mrs chan saw us, she was quite surprised we knew each other. LoL.
