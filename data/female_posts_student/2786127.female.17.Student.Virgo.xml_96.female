I went with my gut instinct and had my dad race on #4, a beautiful pepper horse that looked really spirted. I won! 30 bucks...haha! GOd my gambling obsession is going to be bad when im older.  Good times this weekend hanging out with my extended family. I usually hate little kids as you all know but i'm loving the time i'm getting with my 14(!!) younger cousins this weekend.   Disneyland looms around the corner...DISNEYLAND!! happiest place on earth, the place where genie and I are going to dress like whores and make mickey be a gansta. Hells fun.   I have a black eye too. woo! good stuff.  I'm off to a BBQ at my aunt doris's house.
