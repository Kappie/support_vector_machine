I told you everything, My secretes, my hopes, my dreams, But you betrayed me, How could you? I kept your secrets, had faith in you, But you used me, You went against me, You didn’t support me, You didn’t treat me as your friend. I was an idiot, Thinking that you meant everything, Your encouragement, your support, I thought it was the truth, But guess what,  It was just lies.  How could you?? You treated me like dirt all along, You never realized how much I cared for you. Never realized I would go through hell just 2 save your ass, You never realized how much I supported you. How could you?? Forget who your true friends are.  You ruined everything, Not just for yourself, but me. What you did, Really hurt. It sliced my heart, my everything. Maybe I was wrong all along. I was wrong about everything.  How could you?? You broke that special bond, I shared with you all along, You never realized how much you’re worth. You went so low,  You ruined your life, your hopes and my trust. How could you?? I hope you have a good life, Even though you betrayed me, I wish you the very best with your new friends. But deep in my heart, I still don’t understand How could you!!!!!  I wrote this poem for someone I trusted and cared for. I still can’t believe you went as low as you did!!!! Anyhow, I do honestly wish you all the best and may you live your life to the max. No matter what, I’ll never forget the things you did for me. No matter what you’ll always be my friend. No matter what. Always and forever.
