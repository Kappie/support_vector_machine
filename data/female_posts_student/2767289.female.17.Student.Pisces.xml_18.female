Everyone's into shopping, tanning, beach...etc. I cherish Portland more though. It's laid-back, no-rush, artistic and full of music and culture. The people are more mellowed out and enjoy more than complain... if that makes any sense. I miss home. Yes, I'm having an incredible time on vacation, but it's only a vacation. You know it's gonna end soon and back to my daily routines.  People come here to FL (Serge, for one) and all of a sudden are saying the  love  it here and that they wanna  live  here. Things here are so expensive, yet they pay you crap! It's not all fun in the sun here, unless you're retired, of course, hehheh.  But most of all...Portland's tap water tastes (and smells) good!
