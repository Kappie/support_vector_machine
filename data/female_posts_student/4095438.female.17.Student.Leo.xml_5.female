But, here's what has caught my attention.   I'm following the Iraq soccer team with interest and they're due to meet Australia tomorrow. I think their story is a great one, considering all that is going on with their country; they would have had an interuppted preparation, to say the very least and they were only able to make it to the Games thanks to a ride from the Australian Defence Force. *salutes* This week it seems Bush and/or some sneaky journalists have managed to  urlLink piss off  the team.  I think  urlLink this brief article  somes up why the Iraqis would be pissed and I would have to agree. I'm outraged that Bush could produce something so smarmy after murdering thousands of Iraqi civilians; where exactly does he get off!? This seems an appropriate time to slip in another urge for ALL young Americans to  urlLink VOTE !   French tennis player Amelie Mauresmo  urlLink ruined  young Aussie Alicia Molik's dreams of gold tonight, though the spirited youngster is still in the hunt for bronze.  I had no hope of seeing it on TV, but the Aussie women were part of a  urlLink thrilling waterpolo match  that I wish I'd witnessed and Anna Meares won Australia's second  urlLink cycling gold  in the 500m time trial.  Aussie flag tattoos are common (especially for swimmers) but I just loved Olympic gold medallist Anna Meares'  urlLink fingernails !
