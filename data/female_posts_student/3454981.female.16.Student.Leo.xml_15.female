I guess it's like a battle wound ; )   yeah, never make me shuck corn when I have a headache. I tend to get a little upset. haha--that was so understated. I know it's pathetic. for one, who lives near to Chicago and still shucks corn? I do. That's what happens when you have a road that runs through your town called Hicks Road. Just kidding...I was at my grandmother's house who lives a couple towns over and so I was shucking the corn for a family dinner.      The kitchen was just re-done in our house and it looks so nice. Like it's out of a magazine. I'll have to get a picture and put it up here. Other good news is that I can now put the computer on the desk in the kitchen at a normal height instead of wasting away on my knees in the living room typing at a coffee table. That was the most uncomfortable place to type.      Oh, another complaint (I'm in a sort of bad mood)    Today I was sleeping because I had this headache and no medicine works...but anyway my older sister came back from doing this fund-raiser car wash at the highschool with a couple of friends. it was her best friend and her best friend's brother and her best friend's brother's friend named Artie. Got all that? Basically she came home with one girl and two older guys. They decided that they all wanted to jump on the trampoline in our backyard and put the sprinkler on. But Artie didn't want to get his khaki pants wet so my sister asked me if Artie (who I assumed was a girl with a bad nickname cuz they all have weird nicknames for eachother) could borrow my shorts because I'm taller and therefore have longer legs. So she let this guy borrow a pair of my shorts!!! Yeah they were my soccer shorts but they're still rather feminine. But that made me mad.      goodness gracious how petty this all sounds. Well I guess I should go before I show myself to be a complete idiot.      +song of the day:   somewhere only we know by Keane. click on the title to go to their website. if you don't know who Keane is-then go find out! always great music from them. and it seems to me that they're coming to Chicago on September 19 (and Snow Patrol is coming the next day!) Anybody want to come with me? haha...seeing that I have two readers on here I know it's a hopeless cause :'(
