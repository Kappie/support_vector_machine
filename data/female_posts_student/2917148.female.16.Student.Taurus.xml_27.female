Im sorry for anything and everything  i know i cant be everything you want  but i can always try  maybe i try'd to hard am im losing my touch? falling further away from you  why didnt you hold on? maybe you just didnt care anymore im sorry i couldnt help i still love you though.. i'll always hold on...forever
