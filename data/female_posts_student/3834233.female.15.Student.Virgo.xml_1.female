WOO!! whoever took care of that, i love you. hehe. there was a moth there though, i dont like moths either, but i only saw it once, so i was ok. but yea, work was boring. its the 4th so no one really came. i was so bored that i made my boss a "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" sign...its her birthday today. too bad she is on vacation until thursday. haha, oh well, she'll see it then and appreciate the thought. maybe i'll get a raise. haha...i WISH. oH! i made my first cake today. my first cake EVER. well for TCBY at least. it was the strawberry almond cake. not my fav. but doesnt matter, it turned out damn well, if i do say so myself. hehehe.   so my grandpa is in town...staying till he feels like leaving. i wonder how long that will be. i dunno, im a person who likes to know whats going on...so "playing it by ear" is not my style. oh well i guess. mmhmm, so he's supposed to be here for the 4th of July, which he is, but we are doing absolutely nothing...how...exciting?   oh, more about work...ok, so 3 of our like...7 customers were these little kids. ANNOYING little kids. so first, they order all this stuff and sit down. then this one kid, who we werent really sure if was a boy or girl, came up and was like "Preston had 7 dollars and you only gave him back 2." i was like...um, who is Preston? (cause i know ur family members by name..psh, of course) and she/he is like "the boy in the blue hat." (i glanced over at the boy in the blue hat...check: thats Preston.) and so i went back and checked the register recipt. little Preston there had only given us a 5 dollar bill and he had ordered a parfet, which is $3.53 (i've been working at TCBY for too long...haha). and so, therefore, he only gets like 2 dollars back. so this kid, the he/she, is like "oh, ok then." then later they asked us to change the radio station...then left a minute after we changed it. i dunno, its the little things that piss me off. obvioulsy. i mean....c'mon kids. i guess i respect them for checking their money and stuff, but they were very rude to us, in addition to all the annoying requests. yea, i told you i was a complainer, sorry. that really wasnt a good story. haha, sorry.  today i woke up and found myself running through scenes of Moulin Rouge! Like...Subconsciously. it was weird. i was blowdrying my hair and i was like, wait...why am i quoting 'Spectacular Spectacular'? I'll tell ya, its weird not really having control over what your brain does all the time. Hmm, maybe i have a disease. That would be wonderful.   I cut my leg shaving...it stings. thought i would share. ow.   ummmmmmm, i have nothing really deep to say. nothing interesting to share. nothing spectacular to wow you all with. so i guess i am gonna go. k, well, bye then. take care everyone, and have a great 4th. =)  ~Miranda  ps...did i mention Tegan comes back tomorrow? hehe, well she does. =P
