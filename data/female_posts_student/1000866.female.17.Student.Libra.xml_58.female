Hmmm, I'm talking with Andrew. Haha, he thinks I'm a creepy kid. This is funny.  Anyway, umm, I think I might have a jazz gig, but I have no clue.Eeks. Oh well, they can't blame me when I knew nothing about it! AHHH!  So, I went out to lunch with Diane and Joanne today. It was a lot of fun. I felt kind of bad though, because Diane and I were talking about all this marching stuff, and Joanne doesn't know about it and stuff. Every time I'm with band people I do that, and I really don't mean to, because I feel like I'm making people feel so left out when I do that. It was fun though, reminiscing. I kind of miss freshman year, but 'eh. Not that much. I like sophomore year too. It's cool. Hehe, anyway. Must be off. Heh, seriously, if I hadn't gone crazy years ago, I probably would now...  XOXO
