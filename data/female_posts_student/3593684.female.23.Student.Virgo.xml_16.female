Yes I am a bad bad blogger  Last Week = All Mr. NYU, all the time Last Weekend = All poker, all the time This Week = Friends from Seattle in town = all site-seeing all the time  Quick updates:  affirmatively ditched mr. shahin mr. saturday night called, did not return phone call need to ditch jack too, but I think he has already gotten the idea and has pulled away. I feel bad about this one because Jack is actually a good guy and fun and sweet (unfortuntately, completely incompatible).  What else. David called friday, haven't called him back. the longest he made me wait to return a phone call was two weeks. petty to do the same to him. but honestly, his ex-gf is coming in two days. at this point with mr. nyu around I might as well try to just forget about david.  okay. off to work
