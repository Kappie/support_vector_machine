All they do is go in the house and fly at my head and then go in the halogen lamps and stink up the whole floor with the smell of burning insect flesh. Or people like my dad catch them and hold them in the kleenex while they are still alive and say "look, it's a moth" and laugh at me when I say, ew, that is gross, I don't want to see a writhing moth in a kleenex. Then he goes into the bathroom and throws it in the toilet and watch it flounder around in the water before flushing it and watching it drown. Okay speaking of why you made things, why do guys have to be so obsessed with watching bugs die?   Love,  Sarah
