For some reason, she stayed next to me most of the time, wasn't too badly behaved and was just generally unusual.. Very odd. It was really weird when a very old dog with scabies or something, wandered past and the dogs went ballistic. Very odd.  Tomorrow I am going up to Waitrose for a job interview. (Wai'rose) Hopefully, tomorrow I will walk out of Waitrose with a job. I very desperately need it; I'm getting fed up of mooching off my parents. I also want to learn to drive, but I want to pay for lessons myself. Dilemma indeed..  Today, I had one lesson because I'm dropping maths and my sociology teacher went on an art trip... :| Right now, I'm listening to Franz Ferdinand and eating lollipops. Hurrah!
