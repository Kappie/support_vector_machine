What the hell happened? I didn't understand the concept of a blow job until I read a book on Monica Lewinsky in the 9th grade. I found it, and still find it, and will always find it, quite repulsive. How could anyone bring themselves down to such a low, repulsive level? And these soi-disant "teens" (I use that word loosely, they were barely out of their diapers) I saw talking weren't even the trashy type. They were decent, preppily dressed, bubble gum chewing, happy-go-lucky, all american, you go team!, kind of "teens". Whaaat?   So I had an interview today. *whew* I'm soo glad it's over. I'm such a flibbertigibbet. I talk and talk and just...nonsensical gibberish (redundant, I know...) and just I feel like a fool, and from the inside I'm screaming SHUT UP, YOU IDIOT!! And from the outside I'm talking...talking...talking...AHHH...  I saw Jalaie in the mall today. Twice in three days? Lol...he's a shopper! I'm a returner. Go figure.  I find myself staring at people in public places from under the safe shades I so famously don. There's so much more to pulchritude than one would normally think. Wtf...pulchritude? I need to stop studying...
