It's winter season now in aussie and the weather is F***ing cold! The irony is that, all my frens well which means all the singaporeans were totally clad from head to toe with scarves sweaters, GLOVES( yea beat that, and it's only 14 deg), thermal pants and layers of socks. Shesh, and the most embarrassing thing was that while most of us are shuddering in the climate of the merciless chilly winds smacking us, there came prancing by our sides, those horrendous ang moh kids who are practically dressed next to the bare skin. WAh lao, they were wearing shorts and sphagettie strap tops!!!   *UTTER SILENCE OF HUMILIATION*  Well, seems like a huge mockery to me though. Hahaha! Me and my fren Jasmine aka my small cat were dressed in such thick garments that we were flabbergasted and totally ashamed when some lads and lass were just walking down the street clad only in their Billabong berms and Sea Folly bikinis. Haha! Piangz, that's wat I call being immuned man. All of us dread it when the clock strikes 5pm cos that's when the sun sets and which also spells- DREADFUL COLDNESS. The wind was so dry and chilly.. BRRrRRr. PIangz. Bathing at night was a total disaster call to me. I stood in the bathroom trembling in cold cos I just can't seemed to reach for the bathrobe and my body refused to step out of the shower cos I was so immobilized by the chill! Ah, maybe cos like wat my frens have said, I'm fat free. So well, that's why lah huh?   Anyway, another thing was, the food there is horrendous. I'm not bias ok.IT's true. Whoever tells me that gold coast serve food in servings so huge that I can't even see my face, then I'm going to make sure they compensate for my loss! One Macdonals meal there costs Aus$9.95!!!!! wAh niu. And the fillet-O-fish huh..faint...should call it fillet-small-fish leh. It's smaller than the one in sg and it taste so inpalatable. EEkks! Food and things sold there isn't cheap eh. I tink I spent most of my cash there buying food to feed myself. Oh, have I forgot to tell u that the Singapore fried rice costs Aus$9 there? in a pathetic food court? Hiakz.   Anyway, quite a couple of frivolous stuff happened in the apartment too. There was one night where I was awaken 5 times by a fren's snoring that was so loud, it's erm like a trombone. HAha eh shit, I wasnt allowed to disclosed this. =X hehhe. And my wonderful bew found fren in the trip pushed me to sleep at the edge of the bed and wun budge even when I pushed her over in a QUEEN SIZED BED. HAha... damn funny.   Well well, I guess despite not really enjoying that trip, I was glad I got closer to most of the peeps in my group ( well not to mention the bad side too...A trip exposes the ugliest trait in a few peeps). Oh weelll...tonite must go mambo! I miss mambo.. Only got one more week to club before my ever dreaded work starts. Sighz  ok, till next time! adios!
