Anyways, I got a blister on the inside of my thumb today while mowing the lawn, and it apparently popped while I was mowing, too. And then I got to stick it in some nice, dirty, soapy water to wash the car. Fun stuff. So I'm sure you're pretty grossed out by now, so I will stop :D.     Last song I listened to:   Emaline  live by Ben Folds Five.   Last album I listened to:   One For The Kids .   Last meal I ate:  Salisbury steak. Yuck.   Last movie I watched:   Seabiscuit .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban ! Rrrrr...   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I found a collection of programs from band/choir/jazz concerts in my closet today... Along with my pep band shirt :P.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  The chemistry song over and over and over and...   Last person I talked to:  Dan or Melissa   Favorite song today:   Gimme Three Steps  by Lynyrd Skynyrd.   Favorite food today:  I'm going with a beverage again - water :P.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Washed my car so it shines. It needed it bad. Heheh :P.   Funniest thing that happened today:  David ripped his pants completely by pulling on a tab on the back. Maybe it was a self-destruct tab :P.
