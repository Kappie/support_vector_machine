But it's not that cool. For the majority 'o us, it'll be spent reading supergroovy books and doing nothing. Linds was at...a college. I hesitate to say which one. It was in Kentucky tho...I think?!? Stupid selective memory.  I dun even know how to play Bridge. But that is awesome. You tend to whup up them in everything. Don't you think they'd learn to quit? Abby always wins. And four digit numbers always give me the "wow that's incredibly high" complex, so tharr be a double bonus.   It's ten 'o clock and I'm tired. Hell...it's horrible to be old.
