Talking about it doesn't even help anymore.  I want to cry until my tears are gone and scream until I've lost my voice and concuss myself and scratch myself until I feel more physical pain than emotional and mental.  Ryan told me to sleep, but the voices keep telling me not to.  And I'm afraid of what'll happen if I don't listen to them.  It's not that I don't wanna do what Ryan says--if he told me to jump off a bridge, I probably would, if not only for the fact that I've been on a suicide run lately..  The voices don't want me to sleep.  They're punishing me.  I don't really know why.. but I don't want them to yell at me anymore, and I don't want them to make me hurt myself.  I don't really mean to worry Ryan.. I don't really want to worry  anyone .. I just want to die.  Two "signs of depression" I read somewhere the other day: unexplainable feelings of guilt, loss of interest in things you once loved.  I wouldn't be fucking surprised.  I'd say I've lost interest in things.  I haven't been able to write anything of note lately, not even  poetry , everything on televison's been boring me, I haven't even felt like talking anymore..  I feel lonely, and empty.. Like I'm on the inside of the glass while everyone else is on the outside..   "You can see but don't touch.  Stupid child."   But at the same time, I can tell I'm pushing everyone away.. I don't understand what's going on with me..  I feel like a walking corpse, and I know it's not the music.  ...Please help me...
