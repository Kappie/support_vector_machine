With the frickin wonderful events of the summer..I love coming up here to be near my mom and get away from all the immature shite you can't help but getting involved in. I must be getting my period bc I am about ready to rant. I think the other reason I am dreading going back to Ohio, other then leaving my mom and family....is going back to my friends. lol....and earlier I out a nice post in about them. But I'm not saying that I am dreading going back to them bc thye are horrible people, bc they certinly aren't...it's just that I hate not having the feeling that they support and believe in what I am and want to be. They all know each other and know the things that make them "them"..but with me I feel fake, like I am the stupid friend..and I know that is mainly my fault bc I am kind of stupid sometimes...but really now, how much am I going to know about America, if not having lived here for that long. I really am not that stupid...it's just I am not the best person with words, and so sometimes I try and say something that comes out wrong and sounds like it makes no sense..but oh thats ok...bc it's just silly Jacuqe   LOL PITY PARTY RIGHT HERE *points to self*   wow thats really what it sounds like isn't it? Well maybe I will take up a good idea of my dear knows me friend nicole, who looks at her horiscope every day...maybe that will tell me something interesting that I can look at for...to take my mind off crazy teen girl hormones..hmmm sounds juicy
