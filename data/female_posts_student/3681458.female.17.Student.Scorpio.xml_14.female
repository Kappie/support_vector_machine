You never called my house, because you were a pussy about my parents.  They have never been unkind to you, and you're too chickenshit to call my fucking house (b/c my cell phone is temporarily taken away from me...).  You won't even step up and call me when I am extremely depressed about losing Jared.  You won't show up and see me at work, b/c you fell asleep.  You laugh it off like it's funny when it actually hurts me, but that's because you're an asshole and it's time for this to stop.  You won't do anything, b/c you are "busy"  I was indisposable to you.  Everything was according to how it worked out for you.  And then I call you tonight, and you're like ughh, everyone is out with their significant other and I'm driving all alone...  I am not feeling any fucking sympathy since you could have spent almost all night with me last night.   I feel like a bitch, but I have a fucking point.  I am mad, and I'm stronger than you'll imagine.  You won't be getting a fucking phone call for weeks.  You can forget it.  Until you can step up and act like a man, you can shove me having a part in your life right up your fucking ass.  I don't want anything to do with you.  You disgust me.
