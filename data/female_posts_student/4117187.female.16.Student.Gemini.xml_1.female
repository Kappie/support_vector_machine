Well, also he bought one too so we could see each other -- and I have to admit -- I was almost just as satisfied as if we were together in person.. almost. Anyway, my mom decided to throw fits because when she came in the room she could be seen, and never believed that just because I paused it or stopped it completely that she couldn't be seen or heard. Then this Sunday I was laying on my bed while I was talking to him on webcam because I was tired and he was just doing homework anyway (yes in the summer). My mom came in and didn't really put up a fight about it besides, "Don't his parents think it's weird you're in bed while you're talking to him?" I didn't really think much of it, but I guess I should have. Long story short, my parents both threw major fits and decided that they were going to take it out of my room the following day. Wonderful, isn't it? The one thing that was keeping me remotely happy while Jeff and I are apart was gone.  I spent the night crying and being pissed off because my parents were just being complete assholes the rest of the night. Thank God I have my  perfect  boyfriend to cheer me up when I need it the most. I mean, as silly as it is given the fact that we're both 16 and have been together for a little over a week more than 4 months, but we're planning on getting married. With that fact in mind, Saturday night when I didn't think it was possible for me to go from that mad and upset to as happy as I've ever been, Jeff managed to find a way. He decided my last name was now Caldwell. He kept calling me "Kelsey Alexandria Caldwell," and "Mrs. Caldwell." I was so happy. Not only did he change the last name, he changed the middle name too because he knows I would rather have my middle name as "Alexandria" than "Alexandra" because it sounds girlier. I've never been happier and I woke up still absolutely happy the next day. Eventually my parents said that I could occasionally use the webcam on the downstairs computer if nobody else wanted to use the computer at the time. I guess it's better than I had expected, but parents are stull assholes. I'd still rather have it in my room so I could use it every night instead of just every once in a while.  Another thing that goes to show you just how much he really does love me-- he didn't see me last weekend and he wants to see me this weekend. Wow, big deal right? Well, the only day next weekend I could possibly do anything if my parents will let me is Sunday-- the same day Devin wanted Jeff to go to Dorney Park with him. He decided in a second flat that I was more important than Dorney Park and he'd rather see me. I feel bad about him not going to Dorney Park, especially since it's not likely that my parents are going to let me see him, but I can't help but think it's adorable he'd rather see me.  I noticed I kind of do talk mostly about Jeff in here, but lately that's pretty much the only thing that's been going on that I really feel like talking about. I have my other journal that I write in --  urlLink www.greatestjournal.com/~lucky13880  -- but I have that up for everyone to see and I can't write really personal things about us in there or about my parents or friends that I just need to vent and I don't want anyone to see it. I guess this is more my  diary  instead of just another journal. I guess I'll just come with private stuff and save more general stuff for my journal.  Well that I think is the end of my entry for the time being. I'll be back, I promise. In the mean time check out my other journal if you actually read this. Also, if you read anything in here please comment so I know if I should bother writing on paper or something instead. Bye!
