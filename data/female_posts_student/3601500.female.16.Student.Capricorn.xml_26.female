I have yet to muster the courage to meet them (it's my mother who went over to speak with their parents). It's amusing that they're of our age. The girl is 16, and so am I. Her brother is 14, just like my sister. Their little sister is 10, while my little sister just turned 11. They supposedly moved a total of 18 times 0-0 , because their dad is in the military. As an excuse for not going to knock on their door yet, I was playing the game I bought for Game Cube, Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban. My best friend bought it for the computer, but the two are different! It's more fun, more complicated, and longer on GC though. So anyway, I guess I'll poke my head outside now and hope the neighbours are outside.
