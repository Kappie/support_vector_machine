Pointe-Claire, where we live, puts on a amazing tournament.  Melanie's team didn't win, but still received a trophee,  they are just beginners.  Alex and I are soo soo tired and have no more voices.  Thank God that they don't have this every weekend.  Such stress...  We are very proud of BOTH girls.  urlLink   ~ Valerie is the one with the hands up ~    So I will now put my feet in a footbath and soak them.  Have a great Monday and...............Be Good
