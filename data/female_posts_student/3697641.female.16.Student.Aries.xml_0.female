After all this wanting, I might have found something worth singing for.  Wouldn't that be lovely...  I want to write pretty words.  I want to look back on them tomorrow and days to come and think, "wow, that's beautiful."  but there's nothing beautiful about right now.  and that's why i love it.  it's raw and passionate and spontaneous and i never know what's going to happen next.   and he knows what he wants.  it's not my best friend and it's not some girl i've never met but secretly wish would asphyxiate.  No.    This time, it's  ME.   it's incredible, to be wanted.  it's what i've been searching for all along and it was right under my nose.  isn't that the cliche of the century...  every teen romance movie with a mediocre plot supported by good looking actors is proof enough of that...  but i don't care.  this is perfect, this here and now.  this is you and me and this is what I want.  i just don't know...  if this is all we were meant to be?  we could make so much more.  but it's all up to you.  we will see, in time.  we will see.   "I'm broken, when I'm lonesome... I don't feel right when you're gone..."
