So I've been reading  Emily's journal and it sounds like she's up to all these huge great and  wonderful things. Yay for Em! hehe. Speaking of our foreign friends. Traveling  and whatnot... I'm talking to Marie's friend Jon who is now back in Norway. He's  trying to explain the differences between 'jess' and 'ja.' to me. Apparently, it  is only cool if you say 'jess' instead of 'ja.' Ja is too formal or something.  Its cool though...trying to explain the quirks of the English language to him is  difficult at times. I.e. "what is the difference between 'true' and 'thrue'?"  aka through and threw and true. haha. I wish that the cost of traveling wasnt so  high. I'd really like to see Norway and Finland and Europe in general... but Jon  says it costs him $900 to fly here. Too much for me cause I'm poor. :P   So tomorrow I'm going to the world  series soccer tournament game at the Seahawk Stadium. My dad, brother, sister  and her friend are over there right now watching the practice. Which brings me  to what I spent my day doing. I woke up pretty late and was informed of the fact  that I needed to make the 1 o'clock ferry, and then ride across with brother  sister and company, and drop them off with my dad, and then ride home. But when  we caught the ferry we didnt know that my sister had taken the message wrong  from my dad as to what boat to catch and so when we got over there we had to  wait in the heat for another hour until he got there. It is HOT OUTSIDE!!!!!!!!  If I had known too, I would never have worn jeans. :(  But now I am home and  sitting as close as I can get to my fan. :D  Tomorrow should be lots of fun though. I guess that  the tribe purchased a luxury box that seats 43 for two seasons at the Seahawk  Stadium, and because of his place on the committee he requested that he get 5  tickets to every event. So we got 6 for the game tomorrow... so my whole family  is going to go tomorrow, and I got to invite Andy along too. So I suppose that  in my mom's eyes it will be our first 'official' date. When she asked last night  what was up with Andy and I, I just responded with 'well, we're dating' and she  says 'well how can you be dating? I mean-- you havent gone on a date to anywhere  yet' haha. I understand what she means though. Its just old school. Lol.   So this next story is for Emily.  She'll understand. Ok so I woke up this morning and I figured that my bangs were  getting a bit on the long side. So I washed my hair and got out the scissors and  just cut them. But it was one of those things that went "well that doesnt look  quite short enough.. so I'll take some more off..." and now I think that they're  slightly crooked but that's alright. But anyways- Emily will appreciate that.  Cutting of the hair story.  I havent  gotten to take many 'sophisticated' pictures lately. Also known as 'artsy'  photos. I think I'm going to talk to Somer and see if we can hang out again  sometime soon so that I may take care of my craving of good photography. No more  with my Nikon though. Film is giving me hives lately. I cant do anything with it  that doesnt seem to require massive amounts of money. So I'm stuck with almost 4  rolls of 36 exposure that I need to process. :s I'm going to need to beg  Wodjenski to be able to use the dark room. Anyways- I dont even want to think  about film anymore it's giving me a headache.  So I watched Scary Movie 2 last night. I'm not sure  if it was a waste of time or not yet. It's almost embarrassing just to admit  that I laughed at it. haha. The sex jokes in those movies are beginning to get  to me though. I mean, ok. How many scenes can be filmed and put into a movie,  where a guy gets a girl to give him a massage (ok in this movie it was more like  a hand job because it was 'in danger of being frozen off') because he's in  danger of 'hypothermia'? I mean geesh. Be original. I do love the Wayan brothers  though, and that's half the fun of those movies for me.  ^ I dont think I've ever lost this many times in a row  at Spider Solitare :S Must be the heat^   I will write more later--- I'm going to go to the  movie store now and rent something... I dunno what yet. Jon is telling me to  tell Andy to watch them with me so I wont have to be alone. haha. I wish Andy.  ;) So anyways-- I'll be back later. Goodday to ya all.
