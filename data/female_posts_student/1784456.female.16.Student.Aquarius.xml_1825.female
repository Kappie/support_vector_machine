Laura B knows all the bus times anyway or Megan has a bus timetable ooor I'm sure there's one floating around the net somewhere. I'm going to see relatives. And might not go on Saturday cause I'm going to meet my brother in Wales, there's an Amnesty thing going on there *yeeeah that explains it* Oh sorry about shitty meaning nothing post. When my room's painted and all my stuff's back in the dark corners it used to be in and when my head comes back down I guess I'll say something meaningful. *comment BBE: a few years*
