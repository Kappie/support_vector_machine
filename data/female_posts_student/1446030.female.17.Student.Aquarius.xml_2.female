You may ask....dats becos i'm hurt. I need time. To heal my wounds... as e saying goes : "Time heals all wounds" ( I'm not sure whether it can heal mine anot.. but its worth giving it a try...rite?) About HER, i've decided... i'm not going 2 stick 2 her all the time nemore...she detests me...i can feel that the moment i look into her eyes...dats y i seldom look at her face to face, so that i wun't feel even more hurt. So, i've decided. I'm going 2 let her go... fly into the arms of freedom. (She'll b happy to hear that...) I've figured it out... it would be better to let one out of two persons to experience the pain and agony rather than both of them...and i've chosen. I'll be the one to suffer. To me at least up till now, she may jolly well be my everything, my world, my reason  to be alive. Her presence was so vital to me that she alone could make me give up my 6 years of love for a guy... Powerful, isn't it? Why is it that whoever i cherished will always leave me? Stay, don't leave me. I'm all alone. I'm scared. I'm empty inside. Maybe the only thing that can fill my emptiness is laughter, thats why i'm always appearing so cheerful to others. But i'm sure nobody will know...that deep in the night when everyone is sleeping, i'm crying... To others, i am an optimistic girl. But to myself, i know i am not. Face it, girl.
