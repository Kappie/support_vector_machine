Which mine would be Mr.Hunt(ew) and Mrs.Ferrer :) In Mrs.Ferrer we got to talk all period and relax. I was still bored but it was fun. My mom is still searching for the 'perfect' high school for me to go to next year. It WAS DP but nooooo we're moving to sarasota so i have to go to like a manatee high school lol. I don't know..it has VPA. The teachers are making highschool sound like a torture zone. You have to take a billion classes that really have nothing todo with what you wanna become. Actually i don't even know what i want to be so turns out that dance is really my only option..im not that great at other things.    I'm feeling better. But the thing that kinda made me ticked was when carl(the druggie) said i wasn't worth his time. Well screw him...atleast im not the one on drugs lol. i really don't like him. What am i gonna do over spring break? Probably..nothing. Just sit in my closet lol. j/k parents are taking me to where we MIGHT live. Whats the use? I really don't care what happens anymore...lost all hope. Even though i feel better there's just things that are missing. (I really don't feel like talking about it.)     I hate it here.
