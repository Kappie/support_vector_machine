HELLO! I was not! any other person would have said the same thing I did. anyway, if you push aside all the emotion crap, it was fun.  I went and got the superintendent's signature for my driver's permit, which I didn't wanna do, but I got brave and faced the scary man. so on friday I'll go to the DOT and get the school permit so I can get my car insured and drive to school. FINALLY! *smiles*  later
