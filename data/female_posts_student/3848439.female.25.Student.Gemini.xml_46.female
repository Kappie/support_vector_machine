I pray with people, for people, on behalf of people, in spite of people.  And my prayers are often extemporaneous and off-the-cuff, but with a formula.  That's a bit of a security blanket.  In the past, I've tried to avoid letting any vestiges of the faith of my youth show up in the faith of my young adulthood.  But, now it's creeping back in.  I tend to talk of our "Gracious God."  But I find a lot more "Father God" escaping me.  (Someday I hope to be equally comfortable with "Mother God," but that's a ways off.)  I thank God that we woke up "with breath still in our bodies and blood still running warm in our veins."  During Sunday services that phrase crossed the lips of my father and others many a time.  At first this scared me.  "How can I fully be a justified-by-grace Lutheran if I'm embracing even a small part of my old works-righteousness upbringing?"  It kind of felt like the gnesio-Lutherans from back in early post-Reformation days, "In times of confession and declaring who we are, we can't bend on any point!  Everything is important to distinguish ourselves from the Papists!"  But then, given time, most of the gnesio-Lutherans died out.  Once the fire of "We must be distinct at all costs!" isn't burning with such blind fervor, then the more reasonable voices saying, "Now let's look at our similarities," can be heard.  Maybe it's time for me to move away from that overwhelming need to be different.  If I truly believe - as I often state - that the Churches of God Holiness are comprised of Christians, then we do have a lot more in common than not.  I can truly believe that their message isn't what I need to hear and I actually think all that talk of "earning our way into heaven" did a lot of damage to me individually and to other people, but I want to believe they do that in the spirit of trying to be faithful to God's call.  No, I don't know what it means to call a group or a person "Christian" when I know I'm a Christian and we believe some truly different things.  I'm still working on that.  But now that the terminolgy of my youth is pervading my young adult hood, maybe I'm finally ready to cull through the stuff they've left me with.  Some will stay, some will go.  But maybe I'm more prepared to discern what belongs in which pile.
