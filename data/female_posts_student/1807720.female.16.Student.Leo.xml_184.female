I am eating way less then I was before and working out all the time now.  How am I not losing weight.  Maybe I shouldn't of got a Wendy's salad yesterday with brent, but I mean I didn't even finish the damn thing and I took the rest home.  Oh well, I do feel in better shape then before.  I always thought the scale didn't lie, but my arms feel like super strong and my legs aren't as flabby.  If only my stomach would somehow shrink.  Oh, that would be nice wouldn't it.  I hope Chels calls today.  I want to do something, but if she doesn't then I will just find some exercise vids. in the basement and workout, or go for another hour long walk as long as it doesn't storm like half way through my walk.  It my bike wasn't in such bad shape I could probably go out for a ride, but I think the handle bars are still crocked from me dropping that thing a thousand times last summer.  I probably need a new bike cause I practically killed mine, but I don't really have the money for that now.  We are like ultimately broke now that I have my Car and my comp, but I mean those are like needs for me.  I went to go see the The Terminal last night.  It was a good movie.  If Chels calls we will probably end up going to see Harry Potter cause we both want to see that and we haven't seen it yet.  I am thinking I might go to that opening breakfast at the new station tomorrow.  It's not like I have anything else to do and Chels and I am probably going to the Walmart one on Sunday.  Although I am sure pancakes and stuff aren't the best choice for trying to loose weight, but whatev, I mean I probably will eat enough that won't need lunch anyways.
