It's done, and it makes me kind of sad since it's the last issue with all the people I love so much in journalism. Next issue, we'll have some new blood, and it's scary to think that I'll be the editor-in-chief. Am I ready? I don't know, it's a lot of work perfecting the thing, but I'm so glad Battaglia's there. She's honestly my second mom, and the only adult I really trust outside of my family. I've told her about Mom and Dad's tyranny campaigns, guys, life...  Then I had lunch with Jess. She originally said she'd come in to help proof and stuff, but we were done by the end of seventh period so we just kind of hung out with Pegleg and Brandon and Keira until we really could tape the box shut. And then we went to La Salsa in the Promenade, since I was craving a Baja burrito but figured it would be more convenient in the Promenade. We visited Brighton for keychains, hah. There's a really neat one, leather, that's a rose and when you open it up it's a heart-shaped frame and a mirror opposite. The catch is, it's $38 and I can't bear to part with almost $40 for the sake of a keychain. Granted, it's going to follow me everywhere my keys go (whose picture would I put in the frame? that's a weird question too) but for the same price, I could get a tank of gas. I could get a pair of Converse sneakers. I could get a very decent shirt. I could have lunch a couple of times.  Well, Bowman brought up today that there's this job open in a doctor's office, and they're taking two anatomy students. One does lab work i.e. taking out stitches and staples while the other's the receptionist. I think Jean's the receptionist now, I've seen her in scrubs once. It pays $8/hour. I guess that's not bad, since it's constant work, but it's not much. I hope it starts when school does, since I really want it (the doctor apparently wants smart and friendly people, so I hope that eliminates some of the competition) and if it starts during the summer I probably won't get it. I think Nigel was eyeing it too.  So lunch. And a good talk with Jess, which was nice especially on a random Wednesday afternoon. I'm so happy I can drive now, it's such an awesome feeling just to go anywhere. Broke six months taking Jess to Long's just for the heck of it. Didn't find the giant pack of Halls vitamin C drops, so didn't buy anything. Came home, went into the garage and saw that Mom wasn't home so I decided to return Angela's Ashes to the library. Driving out, I didn't know if it was worth it: it was 20 miles round trip, more gas, maybe traffic, all for a book that was overdue, but I did it anyways. Getting off at the Janss exit, this lady tried to cut in front of me. She had her blinkers on, yes, and I was approaching at 60-ish, but she had them on for such a long time that I thought she wasn't going to come out. Well, she started changing into my lane, but by then I was close. I put on the brakes. I made a screeching noise. The woman, whose license plate was (heart)2 WRTE (she followed me to the library too), retreated. I whispered sorry to the wheels, but it came out as a croak; my throat was dry. I thought, wow, that was stupid of her. And then I thought, did I do that too? I guess I understand why people get pissed.  But I don't like being honked at. Even though I'm not the most competent driver yet (hey, it's day 3) it stings to hear the beep even though any time you hear it you expect it's directed at you. After you hear that honk, you're slightly wounded, I guess. Not so much embarrassed, since the people around you don't know who you are, but just ashamed of yourself. I don't like honking myself, either.  Random phrase popped into my head: "...died and gone to Heaven."  I'm happy. I just have to get this homework done, fun fun.
