Little did I know that, with each leap meant that I would be farther and farther away from a big wet pond with a buffet of flies...  I moved away to school in Miami at fifteen, where i quickly learned that just because you are offered a shiny VISA (and a free T)doesn't mean that you have to vacation in the Keys.  You see I thought that this was the adventure, the autonomy the ACTION...Well, a few months later, with no incoming revenue, because of my rockstar schedule not accomodating for a part time job, I pawned my CD's and my CD player, for gas money to drive the 210 miles to get home, the big wet pond with a buffet of flies.  I flailed my arms and just complained for those three weeks about having no life, being restricted and having no support with regards to my accomplishments.  I mean it was hard work to get a 2.6 in Freshman year classes, and boy did I play up the age card..."Do you know how lonely it is for me, how much harder this transition is when you don't even have a driver's license?..all I really need is your support, how hard is that?  I just wish I was older?"  I moved off campus in 1996 - post the consecutive below 2.0 GPA grade reports, and decided school wasn't my thing and well...I could be an adult, get a job, love the job, make tons of money and never need an ounce of support that I wasn't relying on anyway, right and how did I ever pay those credit cards off... I worked, hard I might add, drawing and writing quippy ad campaigns for Air Jamaica and others to print on napkins, pens, etc...my dream job payed 6/hr, so I was slapped with eviction notices almost every other month, because well my rent seemed to be the last priority when it came to food, gas to get to my job and cable, oh and paper plates to eat my ramen noodles on, you see 6/hr just didn't stretch that far...another miserable attempt of taking the adult world by the horns.  So, i faired better as a Student, I mean the cafeteria was always open, and you just didn't get evicted. Hence the six year bachelor degree plan...I finished and was finally ready to do something with my life, despite how much I would miss the "OG" comments I would always hear underneath their breaths, I had to hop on into more school, this time on a sea bound rock.  "NO, I don't need your help to settle in Mom, God, I've been living on my own for how long now..God I'm 24 years old..."  Well, after the novelty of the place wore off, seconds after regaining consciousness from the nap on the plane there, I screamed "MUMMY!"  I'm a lot older now, a lot more responsible, I pay my bills when I get them, I put stamps on everything, and I give everyone my real social security number and name, use only debit cards, checks and cash, and the big and....I have a savings account....but I still can't figure out why every other day, there are kinks in plans..ruffles in attempts to be an adult...Someone lost the paperwork, We need a roomie ASAP, I have to go the grocery store, dry cleaners, and home depot to cut keys like hours ago, there's always gotta be toilet paper, and reorganize and clean closet days, I am so tired...This is the adventure, autonomy, the ACTION....  I'm here, a few lily pads away from my own pond, a few more hops, a few less hopes....All I need is enough flies here, I just couldn't go back to ramen...
