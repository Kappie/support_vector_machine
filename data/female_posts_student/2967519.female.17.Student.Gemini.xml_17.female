WOW! if that is the kinda reaction Mel Gibson was goingf or than good for him! I was in complete shock b/c this guy wasnt even a suspect! He made it look like it was a suicide...Sick Sick ppl out there! But at least he is behind bars! Kudos to the movie and Mel! LOL Making cookies and watching Oprah, Kayla
