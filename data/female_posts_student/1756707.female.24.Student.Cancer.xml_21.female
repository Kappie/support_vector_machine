Toss marinade together in small bowl, then pour over mushrooms in the Ziploc bag.  Seal the bag, then tumble the marinade around the mushrooms.  The longer you can let it marinate, the better - 4-6 hours is ideal.  Grill mushrooms 3-5 minutes, basting with marinade from the bag.  Set aside.  2-3 chicken breasts  Trim any fat from the chicken and slice into cutlets.  Grill until cooked through, basting with remaining marinade.  To assemble sandwich, place one chicken cutlet and one mushroom cap on a hamburger bun (toasted, if possible) with a slice of cheese between the cap and the chicken.  Tasty!
