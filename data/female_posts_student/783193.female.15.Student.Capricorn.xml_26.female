Well, actually, I've once again become obsessed with taking online quizzes, so I take at least one everytime I start up the computer. It's Cissy's fault, mostly. We even take them at her house. It's pretty funny by yourself, but when you've got someone with you, there's, like, side-splitting laughter going on. Even her mom was saying we were being kind of loud. Oops.
