Last night's was quite strange, winter formal @ the pool and my date was Scott [a lifeguard @ opt] it was just..strange, and he was obnoxious and i dont know.  I woke up half way thru, fell asleep, and actually continued the dream which never happens to me.  So uhm yesterday? Yeah i worked all day. *haha* 12 to 8 30.  It was pretty fun tho, i was supposed to get off @ 7 but tiffany really needed help closing so i stayed with her and helped her do that --good thing too cuz she really messed up. Tiffany's nice tho, just not someone I'd be really close to.  Won't go there right now. Ran in the rain to talk to clint cuz he said he'd pick me up today but thatd be too late cuz i start @ 12 and he's done w/ lessons @ 12 30.  Then said bye to Robert--the only one left cuz we closed early and ran in the rain to the car! I was soaked by the time i got in the house! Haha my pink polo was pretty much red. Listened to Nirvana and Grandaddy to uhm..almost wind down last night *haha* Then bed and now its TUESDAY and working again! Which is fine cuz I hafta take those 5 days off.  Ahh i love summer!
