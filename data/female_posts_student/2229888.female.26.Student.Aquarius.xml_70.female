I love these guys and it's going to be a great week...   poor sheena is as sick as can be! She's been in bed all day, and wants to hold the boop-bop so much!  I told ant i want to be friends and nothing more... he said "get the divorce papers and I'll sign 'em"  i'm about to sign up for school and hopefully start a new job... cross your fingers for me... also, hope that Ant and I will find a way to REALLY remain friends!  there has to be a way... it'll be hard, though!
