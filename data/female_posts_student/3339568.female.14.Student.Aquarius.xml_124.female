And the French listening test was so hard And Tub of lard gives us sooo much h/w I don't do work for the whole wkend and now I am so behind Assignments, tests, homework. I hate it all. English was so boring All this intellectual conversation on Lord of the Flies My brain just can't handle it all on a Monday Attempting to study Science with half my group at lunch while resisting the urge to join the other half in their escapade to destroy the bin. Mmmm...   Don't you just hate that  unsatisfied  feeling that you should have done somthing and you didn't?
