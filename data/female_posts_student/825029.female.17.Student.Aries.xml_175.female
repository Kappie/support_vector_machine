Afterwards, I laid around my house for a while and eventually forced Charles to come over.  Theeeen, we got stuff to bleach his hair, and did that... which didn't turn out like it was supposed to.  So then we ate Chick-fil-A and met up with Mooney and Collin so that Charles could dye his hair blue (in order to cover up the crappy bleach).  Went to Sonic and Habibi and Cockerham were there, so we went to Main Event and bowled.  And now here I am!  It's going to be so boring tomorrow, since it's a Sunday and normally on Sundays I do my homework... but I have no homework!  Hopefully I'll find something constructive to do.  So I decided I'm going to buy a webcam so that I can not only talk, but  see  all my friends when they go off to college!  Charles's idea : )  Got a job interview thingy at Firehouse Wings Monday night.  I hope I hope I hope I get hired.  I need a job (and money) so badly because I cannot keep asking my parents all the time!  Well, that's all I have for now- until next time!  No cool song alert, because well... I just can't think of anything right now.  Adios- Melissa
