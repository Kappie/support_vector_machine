I find that today I miss Jesse more than usual. Maybe because I am having problems and I need him to be home to make everything better, knowing full well that one person canâ€™t fix everything that goes wrong. I have to wonder if God plays a part in the things that happen to me, and in a since I feel that what is going on right now is taking me away from my friends and drawing me closer to my family. It is strange how things work out and most of the time all you can do is wait and see what the life throws at you. My birthday is in a week and I will be 24. I feel like my birthday should mean more to me then it does, I feel like it should mean more then just another day closer to having Jesse home, but the way things have turned out today I could really care less as to whether I am around for my birthday or not. I have a very special 3-day weekend planed for the weekend of my birthday; I am going to Anaheim with my Mom, her Boyfriend Mike and my two Nephews (Isaac and Jacob). I was so happy about this when I heard from my mom, but now I am not to sure how much fun it is going to be, especially if I am not happy while I am there. I sure hope that this mood of mine wares off by then though.  I am sure my attitude for today is the only reason I am not to stoked about the trip.  The FRG Newsletter is going very well and I cannot wait until I show Sgt. Kingsley the finished Product. My Big Sister let me borrow a book on making Newsletters and I am going to peruse it tonight for some ideas on next months issue.
