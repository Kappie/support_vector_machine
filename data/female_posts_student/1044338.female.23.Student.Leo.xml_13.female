The soccer game ended up in a 2-2 tie, but it was full of everything...running goalies (on both teams), great plays, missed opportunities, and rowdy spectators (Quang and myself). There's definately something to be said for amateur sport over spoiled professionals.  On a side note, I never knew that Asian people can turn so red (ie. Roz's face was very tomato-like after the game)!!!
