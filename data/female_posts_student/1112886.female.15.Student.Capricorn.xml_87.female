In Romeo and Juliet, Juliet’s nurse crudely tells Juliet "thou (you) wilt (will) fall backward when thou (you) hast (have) more wit" (Act I, Scene III, Line 41), by which she means Juliet will learn to fall or lie on her back (have sex) when she is older.  we're starting Romeo and Juliet tomora. i'll be the one laughing.  The Bard crudely discusses genitalia size in The Taming of the Shrew where the character Curtis tells Grumio, "Away, you three-inch fool" (Act IV, Scene I, Lines 26-28). Grumio banally replies that he is at least as long as his foot.
