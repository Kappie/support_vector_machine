For me, feminism is mother's milk, a liquid that runs through my veins and becomes one with my life's blood.  I am unable to separate my affiliation with feminism from the rest of my life.  It is part of my DNA to be a strong woman, but every now and then I forget that I have that strength and fortitude.  I neglect that part of myself that can conquer the world, that will be an individual.  I am having a revival of my political alignment.  In the last few weeks, I have struggled with what it means to be a Christian and a feminist, my weight and self-worth issues, and sexual harrassment in the workplace.  Yesterday, I realized that I had been living my life in a vacuum, head buried under sand, letting events and opportunities pass me by without second glance.  Ani DiFranco sings that,  us people are just poems / we're 90% metaphor / with a leanness of meaning / approaching hyper-distillation / and once upon a time / we were moonshine .  Once upon a time, we were pure, rid of societal impurity.  I want to reclaim that fierceness, that independence of mind and self once more.  I want to recover my strength from the terror that I experienced on the morning of yesterday.  No longer will I be claustrophobic, held back from the world for fear of making mistakes and disappointing other people in my life.  I want to eat, sleep, drink, fuck and breathe feminism through my pores.  This may no make sense to you, those individuals in cyberspace who know nothing about me but for the words that I write.  This may seem a jumble, a hodge-podge of vernacular guaranteed to confuse the mind and cause the heart to twist and turn.  It is none of these things and all of these things at once.  This is a statement.  This is a manifesto.  I am a woman who believes, who lives her life under the concept, that feminism can and will free men and women.  I am a white, anglophile, heterosexual, woman-loving, socially-liberal, fiscally-responsible, pro-choice, veggie-tree-hugger, rockin' mama, intellectual, believer in fae feminist.  No longer will I feel as if I am less of a woman, because I expect more from men; more being equality, respect, love, friendship, lust, and decency.  After all, would you expect any less of a poem?
