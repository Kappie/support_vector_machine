He sure took to this blogger thing like a duck to water.  Oh, just incase some didn't hear.  To celebrate Valentine's Day, on Friday we were thinking we could have a picnic in a park, probably the one we cube at.  We could get thoes pre-cooked chickens, bread, and someother ins and outs at a grocery store, bust out the blankets and lanterns and have a eat-a-thon.  We'd probably get there at around 4:30pm (or later depending on afterschool activites) and we could stay 'till whenever.  We could go get cubes if we want, keeping in mind the technique of wetting down the slope before cubing.  ON another note.  I know Jessie and other's wanted to go to the beach, but I'd just like to mention some conflicts.  Jessie's parents could drive but that would only get so many of us there.  Jason said he wasn't sure if he wanted to drive.  Beth and Mandy have an SAT class, I have a car wash at the Branham Flea Market (if you guys want to get your car washed!  come!! please?)  Also, I checked the weather again and the high would be 65, it would be partly cloudy, and it is suspose to rain on Sunday so if that storm comes in early, there may be a problem.  Also, Jessica's party saturday night.  Also, Maggie suggested that we go to a beach that does not involve driving 17. She mentioned one near San Fransico, kind of by the zoo.  The weather would be roughly the same there.  Maybe we should take some kind of group poll?  Anyways, see ya all tomorrow.
