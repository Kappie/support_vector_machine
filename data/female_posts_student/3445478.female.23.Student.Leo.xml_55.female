Right now he's sleeping in his vibrating chair in the bathroom. If I turn off the shower then he'll wake up, so it's still running on a cool temperature so it's not too warm in there. Last night was not a great 1st night alone with Nick! He woke up continually  all night long . But, At least he's doing fine now. I was so incredibly worried.  Shawn's coming home tonight!!! I am sooooo excited to see him. Saturday we are going to go out for breakfast!!! Yeah!!!
