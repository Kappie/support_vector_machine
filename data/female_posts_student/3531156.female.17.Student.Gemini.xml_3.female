Not to thrilled about others reading my thoughts but ill get over it but anyways I guess Ill talk about what I did today. Ummm this morning I woke up and just sat around until 3 and then went and got my haircut really short! Not that short but short for me. Around 6 Alex called me and told me to come over so I walked up there and we just sat on the porch. After like 5 mins I see an ambulance down the street taking someone out the house on a stretcher so I went and sat in the street just watching. Right across the street was Man, Felix,  some body I dunno named John playing basketball. Felix kept on telling me to come over there but I was to interested in the ambulance I acted like I didn't hear em. Then John said "Hey Rolleen come here!" What the fuck? Rolleen? No no no it's Colleen. I just ignored em and walked back up to the porch and right when I sat down Alex came out the house and said we're leaving. So we were on our way to Michelle/Aaron's house. We hadda walk past Man, Felix,  John in order to get there. So we were walking and John stopped us and asked me what my name was. At this point im still trying to look at the ambulance so most the stuff he says I'm saying huh? or what did you just say? But he asks me how old I am then asks for my #. He wasn't ugly so I gave it to em. Not that big of an age difference. He's 20 and I'm bout to be 17. After that we went to Michelle/Aaron's house. We get over there and I find out that Aaron ran away. Now Aaron... I've known that boy since 8th grade me and him are so close. We've liked each other since 8th grade but we've never done anything about it. I care about him so much, I would think he would call me and be like Colleen I'm alright. He knows I'll do anything for him. Just thinking of where he is makes it even worse, especially if he's with Sterling. I can't really get pissed if he's with a girl cause he's not my boyfriend. Usually I'd be jealous but I dunno why but im not. I just no that me and Aaron got something. I no we will never be bf/gf and I don't want to because we have the BEST friendship. I no if I don't getta phone call he gonna be going through hell once I see him.
