(i'm a very undecided person, just if you didn't know...) but yea, work. i worked from 9-3. fuuuun. and NO, people don't get TCBY at 9 in the morning...it takes 2 hours to open the frickin store. i can actually open by 10 (we open at 11) but it's nice to have the time to, ya know, TAKE my time. i also made a great discovery: the stereo at work plays CD's! yes, this isn't one of the biggest discoveries of life, let alone of TCBY, but still. it was exciting because that means i can bring in CDs to play, instead of the crap on the radio. so guess what CD i brought?! MOULIN ROUGE!!! yay! it was awesome...i got to open the store all by myself with Ewan McGregor's sweet voice blasting in the background. needless to say i enjoyed it...until 11 o'clock rolled around that is...  OMG! another happening at work...so i was taking a cake to the back freezer which is right by the door in the back that leads outside. so i was walking past this door and happened to look down at the floor where there was a SWARM of ants crawling around carrying various pieces of crap. so i am deathly afraid of ants...i dunno why, i just am. i hate them. with a passion. EW! ANTS! so i stayed away from the back door the rest of the time...i hope someone takes care of that, cause i sure as hell am NOT.   everyone...im counting down! only one whole day until Tegan comes back...i am SO excited! i am excited beyond words. like, there IS no word to explain how i feel. i cannot wait. cannot cannot cannot.  so, well, i guess that's it for right now. i'm gonna go watch Moulin Rouge i think *obsession* yea yea. well i don't really have much of a life right now so i bet i'll be updating a lot, just cause i have nothing better to do than talk about the life i don't have...that makes sense.   before i go, i have to share: i am watching some MTV thing (yes, i know...shuddup). and there was just a commercial for "warm sensations" trojan condoms....riiiiight. i just wanted to say that, um, aren't you ALREADY supposed to get a warming sensation? hm, maybe i am uneducated...or just UNDEReducated...or something. k, i dunno. bye  ~Miranda
