You know, the one who you keep around in the meantime.She’s not one of the guys, not a tomboy, but you don’t look at her as "real woman" either. She’s not *****y enough, moody enough, or sexy enough to be seen in that light. She’s too laid-back, too easily amused by the same things your male buddies are amused by. She’s too understanding… too comfortable --- she doesn’t make you feel nervous or excited the way a "real woman" does. But she’s cool, and nice, and funny, and attractive enough that when you’re lonely or horny and need intimate female companionship, she’ll do just fine…You don’t have to wine and dine her because she knows the real you already, and you don’t have any facades to keep up, no pretenses to preserve. You’re not trying to get anything of substance out of her. She’s not easy, but you know that she cares about you, and is attracted to you, and that she’ll give you the intimacy you need. And you know you don’t have to explain yourself or the situation… that she’ll be able to cope with the fact that this isn’t the beginning of a relationship or that there’s any possibility that you have any real romantic feelings for her. It won’t bother her that you’ll get up in the morning, put on your pants, say goodbye, and go on a date with the woman you’ve been mooning over for weeks who finally agreed to go out with you. She’ll settle for a goodbye hug and a promise to call her and tell her how the date went. She’s just so cool… why can’t all women be like that?!..But deep down, if you really think about it (which you probably don’t because to you, the situation between the two of you isn’t important enough to merit any real thought), you know that it’s really not fair. You know that although she would never say it, it hurts her to know that despite all her good points and all the fun you two have, you don’t think she’s good enough to spend any real time with.Sure, it’s mostly her fault, because she doesn’t have to give in to your needs --- she could play the hard-to-get-***** like the rest of them do, if she really wanted to. But you and she both know that she probably couldn’t pull it off. Maybe she’s too short, or a little overweight, or has a big birthmark on her forehead, or works at Taco Bell, or just really not that type. Whatever the reason somehow. Life has given her a lot of really great qualities but has left out the ones that men want (or think they want) in a woman. So she remains forever the funny friend… the steadfast companion… the secret lover… and you go on searching for your goddess who will somehow be everything you ever wanted in a woman.You’ll joke to her that she should be the best man at your wedding, and she’ll laugh and make a joke about a smelly rental tux.She doesn’t captivate you with her beauty or open doors with her smile. Mainly she blends in with the crowd. She’s safe. She doesn’t want to be the center of attention and turn the heads of everyone in the room. But she wants to turn someone’s head. She wants to be special to someone too. We all do.She has feelings. She has a heart. In fact, she probably has a bigger and better heart than any woman you’ve ever known because she’s had a front row seat to "The Mess That Is Your Life", and she likes you anyway. She obviously sees something worthwhile and redeeming in you because although you’ve given her nothing, absolutely no reason to still be around, she is…
