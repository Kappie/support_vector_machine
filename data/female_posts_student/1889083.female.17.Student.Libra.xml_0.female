Letting go isn’t winning and it isn’t losing. It’s not about pride and it’s not about how you appear, And it’s not obsessing or dwelling on the past. Letting go isn’t blocking memories or thinking sad thoughts, And doesn’t leave emptiness, hurt or sadness. It’s not giving in or giving up. Letting go isn’t about loss, and it’s not defeat.  To let go is to cherish memories, but to overcome and to move on. It is having an open mind and confidence in the future. Letting go is accepting,  It is learning and experiencing and growing. To let go is to be thankful for the experiences that made you laugh, made you cry and made you grow. It’s about all that you have, all that you had and all that you will soon gain. Letting go is having the courage to accept change, and the strength to keep moving. Letting go is growing up. It is realizing that the heart can sometimes be the most potent remedy. To let go is to open a door, to clear a path and to set your-self free.
