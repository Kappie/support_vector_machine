Instead I stay up and do silly things like look for lyrics to random Jewish folk songs about Russian oppression because the song is stuck in my head.  Its a gorgeous song filled with sadness and hope, set to a wonderful tune yet I can only remember 4 unrelated lines of the song and my mind is trying to play fill in the blank.  So I think I'll go to bed before I go any crazier.
