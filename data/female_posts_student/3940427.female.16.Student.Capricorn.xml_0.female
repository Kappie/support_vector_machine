I'll be ninety years old by the time I get it published. I just have two more characters to profile... Then I need to draw the ones I haven't drawn yet. Yeesh. That's the majority of them. o_O;;  Anyway... CORGI PUPPIES ARE DUE NEXT WEEK!! I can't wait any longer!! *explodes* oO; Yeee... Corgis!! I hope all goes well with the litter, and I hope I can get one! ^0^ I'm so excited!!  Okee, shutting up now.
