Whether or not we see that depends how how we interpret our situations and the circumstances surrounding them - Me  Well, I interpreted something new this morning.  I slept with my space heater because it was comforting to have that direct heat on my back. Especially when I am lonely.  This morning Tycho called me.  I burned myself on that heater. Actually, the shape of the faceplate is now burned onto my skin. That hurt so incredibly bad.  But it was a wake up call.   I do not need it anymore.   I have what I really need.   Matt.   I really am not alone.
