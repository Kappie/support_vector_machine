Oh then in exchange i will just buy the ready-to-make mac-cheese. it's an all-time-favourite!!! then to continue.. i will also teach him many other dishes of mine.  like the simple steamed brocolli with braised oyster sauce with meat chips in it. take note my husband has to an authentic japanese chef.. strictly japanese. the respoosibility of introducing mew styles of dishes will be selfidhly mine. then withmy vivid ad wild imagination/creatvity together we will set up a restaurant selling fusion food trying to pry open the tight doors of japanese fast food.  then i figured we will be the next Mcd or Burger King or KFC or maybe defeating the champions of local japanese fast fod oulets such as Mos Burger and Yoshinoya.  my ideas are flooding my head.. there are of course more dishes stirring within my brain other than the 2 silly diishes of vegetables and macaroni.. although i may seem to appear wonderously ignorant to the cooking world that all women are supposedly to explore it once.  i also learn from my best companion my mother. she cooks well only to a dismay of mine that i am like that. so uninterested in doing the preparation and cleaning up. i am only well trained in messing things up therefore my special cullinary skill is stir-fry.  it's like tossing and turning lifeting the pan abit just to show off.  getting the fire onto the food only ends up in the food being badly burnt.well that's why i need a chef as a husband. well this very short "article" only goes to show my business-like mind.  and my business i have set up such as the make-shift tampons and pads cart-shops have failed terribly due to negligence and over-sight.  before i end i have something very important to annouce. i will hereby appoint myself as the editor of wacky and absurd news of this very prestigious blog of the royal LADIES OF THE RECTANGULAR TABLE. aiya i cahngedthe order but it makes sense. that's all for now. signing off!!
