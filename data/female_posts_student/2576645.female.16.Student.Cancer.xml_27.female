I wish I could just throw out all my makeup and my wardrobe and only buy sweatshirts and comfy pants. What I am troubling myself for anyway? I am not attracting any members of the opposite sex...and it doesn't appear that I will be in the immediate future either.   Don't get me wrong...I am not saying a need boyfriend to be happy. Its just that I look around..at school, in the movies, on TV... and 'love' is everywhere. Maybe it is only apparent to those who want it, like a mirage when someone is stranded on a deserted island, but it makes me think: why can't I have that too? I don't want a boyfriend just for the sake of having one... I am beginning to think I want one so that I can prove to myself that love (or the emotion of which) is a pure, solid, real thing.  Because I am starting to have serious doubts.  I mean...what if 'love' is just all hyped up for the movies and tv and the real thing isn't even what you expect it to be.   Like when I see a commercial for Taco Bell.   I think to myself 'Hmmm...that mexican pizza looks good.'  So I go order one..full of anticipation and curiosity...and then bite into it.   Guess what? They aren't especially appetizing.  That is what I am getting at.  What if love isn't what its all cracked up to be?  If thats the case.....  I just might end up going through life all by myself.  .....and I don't like to feel lonely.
