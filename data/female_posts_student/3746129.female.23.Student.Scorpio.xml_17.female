The honour of Husband and Wife, Isn’t something to be taken lightly, In retrospect it is one of God’s gifts That should be opened rightly.  Handling a marriage, Should be done with extreme care, For a couple who can make it last, These days seems rare.  Using caution and being open With each other, Will help to keep the flame burning In you for one and other.  Pushing through the tough times, Like a shovel in the snow, Will help to keep you grounded And raring to go!  Honesty is one trait You both should wear with pride, Because it words only cause pain When bottled up inside.  The secrets to a successful marriage Can’t be sold in books, But the knowledge comes from deep inside, You just need to look.  By putting your heart on the line In a deep situation such as this, Will help to give a new definition To the term wedded bliss.  Once the rings are placed upon the hands And the vows have been said, It’s up to you to make it last, By forging on ahead.  Moving into territory That is seldom traversed for long Will help to make you record holders For a marriage that is stong.  Being in strong in love and life Is something of a challenge, But faith in the Word of God Will bring you closer to his palace.  In these times of divorcees And spiritually bare lovers A couple that is as in love as you Makes even the skeptics want to blush.  Holding on to one another As you trudge ahead, Will help to make your journey All the more memorable For the generations still ahead.  As a new chapter is begun In the book of your life, I pray that you have The most blessed union As Husband and Wife.
