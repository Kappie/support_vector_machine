Boots drew me this prettyful picture that you can looksie at by clicking  urlLink here . Boots is the one in the apron, I'm the one with the Chinese-style shirt.  I'm sick of school. Is it over yet? At least my college classes end next week. It's a shame I can't say the same about high school.  I got my prettyful class ring today. All bow down to the engraved dragon. The stone has this shiney stuff behind it that makes me dizzy from looking at it. It was funny. And the ring came in one of those fuzzy box thingies. I proposed to three people. Only one said yes though.   Current Mood:  Ditzy
