To die like the lucky! To never count the seconds Never having time to numb to the pain  Oh, porcelain Like a little doll you smile I see velvet, I see mahogany I see the black and I am zen Little painted faces With little painted tears  I painted your face A canvas like wine Turning a crimson as it hit the air  You are on my body now Dried And burned An end so perfect  Because it is the end.
