That was my poem I made up during the Less Than Jake/Early November/The Reunion Show/The Academy concert. I really love Ace, as I'm sure you can all tell.   So Friday was lots of fun! I had a math test, but I missed the first problem, and it is really bugging me! We ate lots of Cracker Jacks in History, cause we were watching a movie about baseball and Jackie Robinson. I had gym, again! I swear, I have that class everyday, and Ms. Standley is such a hard ass! She makes me sweat, A LOT. I was the only one to do my homework, so I was teacher's pet, and everybody judged me. Alice is just so funny in that class! She's so tall, so it's hard to do all the kicks and stuff, you just have to watch her, love that kid! She and I have to make up the class we missed, even though they just walked around Bexley-so not fair! After class, Liz and I rushed to get ready to leave for the Newport. We got there...and nobody was in line, except these twelve year old kids and their parents we see at every show! We walked around the campus a lot looking for band members to stalk. Then we went back to the line and met these girls from Michigan. All of a sudden, we see the Early November bus drive past, and everybody sprints to the back to see them. ACE IS JUST SO GORGEOUS. He's nice, too. Desire, this girl we see EVERYWHERE AND IS SO OBNOXIOUS, baked him cookies, bitch takin my man. HAHAHA KIDDING! We got some pictures, and I was like "Well this is what you get for being a rockstar". He was really confused, especially cause their music is not rock at all. We followed Ace and Joe as they went to Asian Yum Yum, but we went back to the line and talked to the Michigan girls for the rest of the time. One of them wanted to go find Sergio and get a picture. I went with her, and I kind of wish I hadn't. I like gross stuff, but this was weird. We go over and she asks for a picture, and he goes "Okay, but let's get my shirt in it". Well, he was wearing a tank top where the arm hole is cut really low down the side. He put his arm around her, then folded all the extra material over so that his nipple was exposed! For some reason, I just got really creeped out. She and I went back to the line, and Elizabeth and I told them all about CSG and the Se√±or finding everybody's blogs. They were really interested-guys we need to do True Life: I'm a highschool senior at an all-girl school, NOW. I saw this sophmore I see at every concert, she's always like "You're stalking me." Dude, no. You're obnoxious and you never leave me alone. She came over and said that, and I said, "Okay so get out of here." But she didn't leave! AHHHH. Then we met up with some other kids we knew and they got to do an interview with Joe, from E11. They let the pre-show kids in and we got right up by the barrier in the middle-a fantastic view! The first band, The Academy, didn't come on for a long time. They finally did, and they were really good! The lead singer was adorable, but he reminded me of Jessica from "I want a famous face" you know the girl who was really a guy-this boy was just so gangly and feminine looking. I would have bought their CD if I wasn't completely broke. The Reunion Show was next. Their music is not my favorite, but the crowd went NUTS! There were so many crowd surfers, it was just bad. But I laughed the entire time! I couldn't help the crowd surferers, cause I'm just too short. It was bad, Elizabeth would guard my head and the Security Guards would tell me to duck, it was kind of embarrassing. One of the guys in the band was crazy and really funny. He would jump down into the barrier and sing and it was great. One time, he came over and stood right in front of me, and put his guitar in the air and was right in face. I kind of freaked out, but it was awesome! I laughed so hard, it was so painful, and so funny. One time I was laughing, and Elizabeth got pushed towards me and her boob is right at my mouth level, and it went in, and at the exact same time I closed my mouth. I BIT HER BOOB, OOOPS! The Early November came on, then it started getting out of control. Ace was gorgeous, of course. They played hard and were rockin, but the crowd was so bad. One time a crowd surfer was coming, and their crotch hit my head with their legs on either side of my face, and this caused me to bang my nose into the metal barrier. I couldn't feel anything for five minutes. I thought I had broken my nose, but I think I'm okay. Sergio, one of the band memebers, was bleeding all over his face. He said he "busted up his skull" and there was blood everywhere. Well, it was mixing with his sweat, causing easy rubbage all over. When they ended, we left the pit. I'm not the biggest Less Than Jake fan, and I wanted to get out. It was hard to leave, but some people were really nice and let me through. We met some of the first two bands and then talked to Sergio and Joe. We watched the last band from the back, which was much better than the pit. Finally, ACE CAME OUT AGAIN! I got a hug, and enjoyed it. I told him about my nose, and he was really apologetic, not that it was his fault. I'm so sad that they're only playing on the Warped Tour on the West Coast, but oh well. All-in-all it was really fun!! When we were leaving we ran into Olivia Marcoux-coolest kid ever. Now I'm not doing my homework. I cleaned the cars today and got $5. I'm going over to Erica's tonight to leave for the March in Washington tomorrow. I'm super excited to protest Bush beeyatch. But I have to work on my English paper or I'll die next week. This weekend is awesome, have a good one!
