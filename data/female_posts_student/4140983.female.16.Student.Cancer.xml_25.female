It's training you to push the buttons...  That's right, I played in the mall today. I hope you people are happy, I've joined you. What's this about a "cult"?  Two days of freedom. Neither technically free. Guard tomorrow, eye appointment Wednesday, as well as shopping, provided my dad sends a check.  My stepdad's birthday is in like ten days. I figured I'd have money to buy him something, but the way things are looking for me, I'll have ten dollars. And a pair of contacts.  And oh god. My county is ranked number 4 in the ENTIRE NATION for poultry production. Can I get a "yeehah"?  Yes, that's right, I had to make an entry for the express purpose of providing my one reader with a bunch of crap that honestly, nobody should care about. Except the DDR thing which was damned funny.
