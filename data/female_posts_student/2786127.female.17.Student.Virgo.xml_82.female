I really want to reconnect with lindsay and makenzie, I need to get on that soon...very soon. I also need to go up to the lake immedes.  My dad and I talked about how my sister is a bitch last night. Hilarious...I'm glad that he agrees with me.  hey...I had a 75% in my math class...I got a 100% on my final...and now i have an 80% !!!!!!!!!! WWOOOOO FOR B's! I was crazy excited when i found out.   Freeeddooommm.
