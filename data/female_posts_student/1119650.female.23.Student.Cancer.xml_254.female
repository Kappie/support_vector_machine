No more bacon, egg and cheese for breakfast, no more dunkin donuts.  I can do it, damn it.  (Please pardon my bitchiness should it crop up in the next few days weeks).  I'm walking a mile at the local high school track every day, I'm still doing my Pilates.  I started taking a multi-vitamin and vitamin C (in hopes that I can kick this pesky SARS).  I invite you all to place your bets now as to how long this lasts, maybe I'll send you a neat prize if you win.    Next month is my birthday, I will be 22.  I feel like I have no good milestone birthdays to look forward to anymore.  Can't I just stay 21 forever?  Maybe 25 'cause at least I can rent a car then.  I shouldn't be so outta shape and the teensy bit over weight that I am, so hopefully by end of teh summer I will be decent...just in time to pack on the winter weight.  Yay.  Lol.
