I guess the passage of time, especially time spent doing nothing but eating and watching tv, just has to make you laugh at yourself for having nothing to do. But it's Easter, not that it matters. Yes, it does. Nothing good on, except crucifixion specials. I'm not interested.  See, I don't even know what to think anymore. I really need this downtime since during an ordinary week I'd be perfectly starving for it, but this absence of anything to do just makes me...laugh. It's mainly my fault. Not in the mood for any more history studying since I'm not allowed to hook up the iPod anyways. Maybe I'll wrap those last five packages, but I've become increasingly disgruntled by imperfect corners. Afraid to go to the library, since books will take a dangerous importance over everything else, but I still want to read up on Best American Essays. And I don't want to touch that bio book, as stupid as it sounds. Mind over matter.  I just console myself that everything leading up to Tuesday is worth that one fantastic day, and I'm all right with that. Who knows what I'll do after Tuesday. I dare not imagine. Tomorrow I'm going to have to clean up the piles and piles of miscellaneous clothing in the closet and draped over chairs and on top of dressers, and organize it somehow so that I can wash it. And then I predict it's going to be at least a few hours on the piano in anticipation for the lesson. Maybe I'll revive the Schumann. I'm in no mood to start the Chopin just yet, and I don't even remember if I finished the Schumann. That's tomorrow's work. And then the Alamo, at 7:05. And then TUESDAY!!  Maybe I'm crazy.  I really hope Jess is ok with taking me, though. I've been wanting to go back to Third Street for a long time and I just love that feel of driving along PCH. But I'm not quite sure her parents (or her, for that matter) are exactly as thrilled as I am. And I don't mean to drag her along for birthday excess spending when she feels left out of it. Don't even know if Tiff is coming. For her good, though, I do hope she goes to Disneyland. But will it work out?  I've been trying as hard as I can not to let that upsetting spring break nothingness feeling settle on me, and it's working all right, I suppose. I have a considerable pile of notecards for USAP. Funny enough, nothing pleases me more than seeing that multicolored pile grow, and I find myself learning things that I missed the first time around. Maybe I'll actually get a 5 this year, arr. I hope one day I'll wake up in the morning and decide it's the right time for bio. At any rate, I've taken over the media room, and fortunately I haven't dozed off on that marvelous couch yet. I just hate waking up early in the morning and getting a bowl of oatmeal plopped in front of you at the table even though you haven't had a decent breakfast for the past...oh, since September. I can't count backwards. I hate listening to the phone ringing, that disgusting yellow glow on the walls right before noon, 2 pm. I hate lunch when I'm still not hungry, trying to get back to work on a full stomach when all my body wants to do is slow down and digest. It's simply a whole different rhythm, and being the little freak I am I'd almost prefer school. If I could drive myself off campus for lunch.  Last night was a good time.  If I have a spring break theme song, "Photobooth" would be it. Never mind the lyrics, I just like the kind metallic clang at the beginning, the first few verses. Laid back. Lovely. Have to get the CD. It will be driving music, I promise.
