A certain person kinda bashed what I thought was cute, dunno why it got me so...catty, (you know, how their hairs on their backs raise..?) but it did. It annoys me SO MUCH. sheesh. At least be joking around...but if your not...I really don't need it. I doubt anyone does, you know? LoLz, I'm not really upset, just annoyed. But, hey...it's all good....           It's like Christbashers....ALOT of them come into the CHRISTIAN chat room and they start talking parc.. I'm just like... "Hello!!!! There are rooms for the whole "f this, f that, Jesus sux" type of thing. Make your own Athiest room or somethin!!! Sheesh!! Sometimes, I  don't  FEEL LIKE ARGUING!!! SO GO AWAY!!!!          Sometimes I just wanna sit back and chill. Have a nice clean convo about....cheese or something.          Which reminds me, no cheese SO ruined my morning. It sucked. I was just like "What, no cheese?" and then Grandma told me to go digging in the stand up freezer, so I did and saw NO CHEESE. She insisted that it was there tho, and I was just like "Whatever" lolz. I didn't like my food cuz I wanted a piece of cheese on my egg in an egg sandwich and cheese in my grits. It didn't taste right. Not even the bacon tasted right. It was so freaky. Then, later, I walked in the house and Grandma was like "I found the cheese in this freezer, it wasn't in the other one." I was just like........................................................................................ *sigh* and stuff........My n Daddy are goin on l8r to get some stuff. Hey, I got this webcam thingy working on the computer. It's thru the camcorder tho, so it's weird. It turns off every 5 minutes or so. I wanted to throw it across the room. But, I wouldn't do that.         This musik on TV sounds like FBI. What am I talking about? I mean, The X-Files. Great.     Last night was Friday Night Fire and First Baptist Church of Cooper City. It was awesome. I'm disappointed in Stephen tho cuz he was supposed to do both of the rap parts in Jesus Freak and he ditched talking about he stubbed his toe at home and twisted his ankle or something up in Orlando. He didn't wanna go in the first place tho, he said it. I was like "Then why did you even come to the practice, why didn't you tell us earlier that you didn't wanna be in this?" and he was like "I did!" I was just like "No, you didn't."                     There goes my Secretary vote for  Kaetlyn. She had a speech and everything. I think she has it. Stephen's never here most of the time anyway, I could never depend on him for like.. anything really. He says he'll be there....he doesn't show up, why? Because he was too tired, he stubbed his toe, he has to go to a friends barmizvah, what's next? I had to go feed my pet monkey. That's something he'd probally say, too. I love him, yeah. He's like another brother to me, but........ he's too bizzy to be secretary, or at least, I think so. He's got an awesome future ahead of him and obvioulsy more important things to do, so.....hey! It's all good!!                     Matt and I sang the 2 rap parts in Jesus Freak and both songs went well. We sand "Jesus Freak" and "He Reigns". When I sand my rap part, these people to the side of me were chanting "Go! Go! Go! Go!" It was so funny! :P                    Everyone had so much fun. We all danced around when the other ppl were rapping and junk. It was crazy. But awesome.                  Hey, all who read this, you guys, COMMENT IN MY BLOG!! I wanna see stuff, questions, anything you want me to write on.........ANYTHING. Tell me how dumb my posts are, or how funny, how long, annoying, short, interesting. Whatever you choose. Anyway, I'm gonna goes now.. See if there's anyone outside to hang out with. B Byeness!!!!!!!!!                ยบ~*KrIsTeN*~ยบ   xXo, XxO!!! Which do you prefer??? Big Or Small!?!?!? :P
