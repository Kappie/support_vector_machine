And my mother  really  bought him a 6610 Nokia handphone and he is right now beside me playing games with his friends on the hp. And I am still using 8250 Nokia hp. *steam brewing out of my ears* 0_0 But yesterday was very enjoyable and fun for me.... My family and I went to opp. Bugis Junction, a very small Hong Kong Steamboat retaurant. Their service was quite good, even though I spilled my very hot Tom Yam soup on my pants. *Blushing* I really enjoyed it. I recommend this retaurant to all of you. Especially the health- conscious people out there. Their Tom Yam Soup is very spicy and good. And the fee is $15.80 for adults and $12.80 for children below 12. But if you want cheap steamboat, go to Marina Bay. They are famous for steamboats and cheap $12 rating for adults. Except that there is not air- conditioned. So far, I had 2 steamboats at Marina Bay, 2 at my friend's house, 1 at my Grandpa's house and 1 in my very own house and 1 at that HK restaurant. That's 7 steamboats I ate in all.....
