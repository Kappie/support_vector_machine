I showed him the place where one of my old, unrefined webpages (as in, pre chingay.com, which was pre chingay.net -- both domains now defunct) was listed as one of "best of the cyber pinoys." It was at  Tanikalang Ginto (August 29, 1998)  if you must know and it was on Xoom no less. I don't know how many of you remember those days. But man! Those were the days, weren't they?
