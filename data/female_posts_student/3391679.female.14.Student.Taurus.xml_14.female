My cousin was here for 3 weeks and i was ready to kill her........ {I am too upset about the harry potter movie adn all they left out} My summer sucks. my sister attacked me the other day u have no idea. I decided to go to a different highschool than her because starting sophmore year im going to take an "academy" that is going to teach me medical things {real kewl} so i habve to get up earlier and she {for some reason} keeps trying to convince me to go to her highschool. y this is idn because we agree we r togeth too much {i mean we share a room} i just need a vacation and  i want to go to see the day after tomorrow i mean the graphics need to b seen in thearters and i cant go w/ out my mom and i cleaned the entire house yesterday wen my mom was at work and gabby sat {ask hr she will admit it} and what does my mom say ...... "wheres the food .....where is dinner" llike can u give me 5 seconds of rest between washing dishes and food... then i cook spegetti and what do they say? huh huh huh "its too spicy wen r u cleaning the dishes u used " I want to scream ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
