Does this make me sound insensitive?   but then, i'm alway the first to apologize. i just want people to be happy. is that really such a bad thing? i just want people to be happy. even if it's not always me. even if it's not always right. i want to cry for this, but i know i haven't done anything wrong! I haven't done anything wrong! I Haven't Done Anything Wrong! Why?! Why?!     i'm sorry there's nothing i can say to make this better.   Driftwood: A fairy tale So he would sulk and drink and mope and cross his arms and hope to die. And then a fairy came one night to bring this sorry boy to life. She pulled some strings and spun him about. That boy sprang up and began to shout, "My arms, my legs, my heart, my face they're alive!" And she would cry, "Liar, liar! What have I done? You're no lover, and I'm no fighter."
