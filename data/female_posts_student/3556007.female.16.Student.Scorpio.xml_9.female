He thinks that she is jealous of me, and she damn well should be. He spends more time on the phone with me than he does with her. He told me that she was saying things like, "I know that something is going on with you two," but he was like "No, really there is nothing" because we haven't done anything. Then Hunter said something like "I don't want her to ruin our friendship." Also last night he was like "What is wrong with having a really good girl friend?" when he was talking a bit about Amanda... That is what I mean by confused signals. Then he says all this stuff about "Yeah, I should take you out to a party sometime." Then we were discussing Hillary Duff because one day he was like "She is hott," so I ripped her pic out of a magazine for him. I told her that she was from Texas, so he said that all the pretty girls were from Texas and told me that I was pretty!! So we kept talking about random things, but then going back to preCal and "studying" a bit. We actually got a few problems done for practice, but he is kind of slow. Oh, and then he asked me who I liked... I wanted to say that the guy I liked had a girlfriend so that it doesn't even matter. Ahh Amanda just IMed me right now. We are talking about scrapbooking club. But back to the thing about who I liked. I talked about Eric and how I liked him last year, but how we didn't have anything in common anymore. Then we just started to talk about everything. He talked about his time when he lived in Egypt... We talked about everything. Talked about baseball pants, and how I can't play baseball because I can't hit the ball. Then Hunter was like "I'll teach you." We talked about so much, and I am so confused. Does he just like me as a friend? Or more? He tells me that I am pretty, he tells me that he should take me out some time to a party, he tells me that he really wants to go to Germany, he calls me every night, we talk for hours at a time, he gets me flowers for his birthday, but... At the same time he still has a girl friend. This makes my brain hurt.
