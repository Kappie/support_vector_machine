So why the hell did I do it????  grrr. He is fighting for my honner and stuff like that... I don't want him to! Half the fights he gets in the middle are little ones like -whats up with your name- kind of fights. That I probably started! belive it or not, I like to fight little fun fights. But I wish he'd just leave it alone! :*-(  cry
