Those kids are not only dumb but they smell really bad!  It's not being mean if it's the truth!  The rest of the morning was the same old stuff.  Then came that hoop dancer at lunch.  Seniors be glad you didn't have to go to that!  I found it boring, but others said it was cool and I say to them, "did you have your eyes open or closed?"  Chemistry was okay. We stared dem. Analysis when I was gone yesterday but I breezed through the worksheet she gave us b/c I've already done that in Physics.  See they go together, stop calling me nutz for taking them at the same time.  History was horrible!  We got our tests back and let's just say I've never done that bad on a test before.  Newspaper was triumphant b/c I got to delete AJ's name off of the layout slot.  If you didn't know how do it or didn't plan on ever learning why didn't you tell Mr. Powers sooner?  This is the end of my AJ bashing I will stop from now on I promise!  Then after school it was off to make up a chemistry test.  I know I did well on that.    ~Sean, stop looking for the girl and she will find you.  Also, some days I agree with your friend Chase on his high school relationship philosophy.     ~Megan, Thank you for reading my blog...it's so worth typing now.    ~I have a hard time decided what to put in here b/c I don't know who reads it, if anyone.  I'd like to say though I've given up on a certain someone.  If you're nosey and wish to know I'm sure I'll tell you.  But just let it be known.
