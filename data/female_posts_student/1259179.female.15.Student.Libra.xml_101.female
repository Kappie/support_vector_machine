I was so mad but I used bad judgment and i shouldnt of said that...the 2 words F****** B**** make me look horrible when they are used together. I feel really bad now, im a horrible girl. Today was NOT so swell, i got a teacher yelling at me *a guy* for something I didnt even do and he didnt even give me time to explain, he just told me to shut my mouth and talk to him after class, which made me look bad!!!!! Then i told him it wasnt me but he said i have had a bad attitude problem, lets wonder why! :/ No track today, too cold.    LOL Thanks sandee, you really gave me a traffic boost!!!  I didnt think anyone really noticed that i left for a bit. ;) Im really glad about ur results!! I Love You!
