Yep,  I  want a tattoo... Yes, the same person who always said she was too indecisive to ever get a tattoo...  I think I want it to be of the constellation Orion. There won't be much to it--just the dots (or maybe stars) that make up the constellation. No lines connecting them or anything...   Why a constellation, and why Orion?  ...Well, it's no secret that I looove the stars and the sky and that I loooooove to just stare at the stars. I've always loved Orion more than any other constellation; I don't know why... I just love it!   Whenever I gaze at the stars the first two constellations that I look for are Ursa Major (the Big Dipper) and Orion.
