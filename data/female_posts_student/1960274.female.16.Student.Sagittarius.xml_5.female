This has been one of the best studies I have ever done.  Everything Christ did here on earth was to help others, heal others, or teach others.  I need to develop that mentality.  So often I get caught up in my world and everything I have to do, that I forget to take a look around me and see all those hurting that I could help.  I loved Amanda's blog  urlLink Something I've Noticed .  Everything she said is so true.  Another trap I fell into is that I get so caught up in the activity that I forget that my real ministry is the people.  I'm leaving for my SMITE trip to the Bahamas on Saturday and my biggest prayer is that I won't get so worried about making sure everything is perfect and on schedule.  IN the scheme of things, who cares if game time goes a little long, or if the craft time gets cut short?  As long as I am focusing on the people and really trying to reach out to them.  The Bahamas is a third world country, so I am imagining that these people are going to be very poor.  It is going to be unlike anything I have ever seen before.  I really want to touch their lives in a special way.  I want to deny myself and focus on them.  Our theme verse for SMITE is Matthew 6:24 "...Deny yourself, take up your cross, and follow Me."  That is a huge commandment.  I want to follow Christ.  Taking a look at Christ life, he was always around people.  He was never too tired to help them, he never needed some alone time, he never said no.  His ministry on earth had a huge impact on everyone.  Obviously, I can never have as big an impact as Jesus did, but I can have an impact on everyone around me.  The way I can do that is by each and every day giving myself to God.  I need to do what he wants me to do, not what I want to do.  One of my favorite songs is by Tree63, Over and Over Again.  The chorus says "I give myself away every single day, over and over again.  You're the only thing that's true, and I give myself to you over and over again."  The lyrics to that are so powerful.  In order for me to deny myself, I need to follow Christ.  In order to follow Christ I need to give everything to Him.  Each and every day, I need to devote my life to Him.  I need to do that over and over again.
