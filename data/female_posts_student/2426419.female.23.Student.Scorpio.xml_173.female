St. Augustine says that God is darkness too, like a black lady's skin or the blanketed ocean at 2 a.m. besides, if you are in the darkness, i am surely there too, and we can go through it together.  i don't really need to be consoled and you never did anything wrong, at least as far as i'm concerned. i'm glad i got to talk things out with you about philosophy and religion. i think you helped shape and lead me to a place i am now, and i consider that a good thing.
