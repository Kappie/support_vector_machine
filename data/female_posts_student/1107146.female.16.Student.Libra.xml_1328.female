My dad is starting to screw around with his old girlfriend again, and  epiglottical tongue suture with a cranberry wax sauce . Problem and random thing. I have gone insanely mad with madness. Forgive this slightly odd post, but the strangeness of the emptiness of the BLogness is totalling my last semblances of normality.
