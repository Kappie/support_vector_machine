The drama was: Hannah McClamma came over and Gilbert looked at me and said," I'll tell Hannah what you said." She asked what I said and I was like, oh yeah I hate you Hannah; you didnt hear? And we started laughing and she poured red fanta on my grandfather's shirt. *a braves shirt, and he said be careful with it* So naturally, I was pissed. So I walked off. And she started crying. Then one thing lead to another and she talked to me and Lauren in the bathroom. And I just started saying whatever came to mind. And i told her not to talk to me, I dont want the drama. And she told her mom and as I was walking off to go tell Mark bye, her mom has the audacity to ask what was on my shirt. I hate her mother. And I dont care who knows that. But, through all of that I got to spend all day with Mark. It was great. And then I went to Fun Town with Lauren and Callie. Then we went back to Lauren's house and spent the night. Callie came hone with me and then we met Mark and Adam at the movies tonight. We saw White Chicks. It was sooo funny. But even better than that, I was with Mark. He makes me soooo happy. We were sitting in the movies holding hands, and I had the best feeling. I was/still am sooo happy. He means so much to me. When he looks at me, I get lost in his eyes. And when he smiles, I cant help but to feel wonderful because I caused that smile. He makes me feel like I am beaustiful. I wish I could tell him how much he means to me, but I cant. Words truly can't describe how I feel. I love this feeling...
