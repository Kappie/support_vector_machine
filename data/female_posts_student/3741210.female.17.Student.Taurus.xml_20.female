Then we had nothing better to do so we hung out at my house for 3 in a half hours and talked. What did we talk about you say? Indian family parties, a cat named Mango, and whole bunch of other random stuff I can't rememeber now. Stephen, my brother is going to be so mad when he finds out that they came over while he was at work. But its all good now because he should be home any second and then he doesnt have to deal with work for another day. Yesterday I may have laughed at him because he had work today and I had the day off. So he may retaliate. Its such a futile fight becauseobvioulsy your situation changes everyday.   Now I have 2 people IM-ing me and its hard to write in this and type to them. Plus, there's nothing more to write about in this exciting life I lead. Dont you worry though, the next time I even  think  of an interesting tidbit, yall be the first to know.
