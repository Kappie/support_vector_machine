I dunno, as much fun as I had, it kind of felt like something was missing. Dammit, I hate the feeling of emptiness and not knowing why I have it. Don't get me wrong, I still had a really good time tho. The limo ride was funny. On the way there, I sat between Ben and Ryan. When the limo did certain turns or something, I would kind of slide towards Ben. It was funny. On the way back, I sat between Scott and Ryan, and I would slide towards Scott. It was funny to me anyways. I dunno. Amanda and Holli kept joking around that I was hitting on their dates. At least I think they were joking. haha. I'm not sure. I wasn't hitting on their dates tho. So, I'm pretty sure that they were joking. Geez! This is so confusing. The more I think back to prom, the more I can't get over the fact of my empty feeling. I think it has something to do with the fact that I went with Ryan. Ryan is a great guy, but I kind of wished that I went with someone I liked. There were a lot of couples there, and it made me realize that I would love to have a boyfriend....but I'm just not ready for one. I've only really been able to picture myself with one guy, and of course that is the one guy I can't have. Why do things like that always happen to me? Oh well, eventually I know things will have to go my way for once....I hope. I still had a good time at prom tho, so that's good I suppose. Well, that's about it....
