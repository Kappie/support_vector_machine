NOTE: This is not in any way appreciated. When you make plans to do something with a stinkin' person, do it. Otherwise, don't commit kids- just say no.  And   how   do people not know what Plinko is? What is this madness? Its PLINKO. Every good American citizen should know this. yes, they should. It is a ridiculous, stupid, awesome game. I *heart* plinko.   I seriously have nothing to do, **eats a spoonful of frosting**  and we have no food in our house. It is sad. People come over and offer us food stamps. Well I mean they would...if they came over...instead if canceling...and no, I am not bitter.  Ok so I was just told that I "jive." Umm..what? I have absolutly no clue what that means, or how I do it. So if ya know, give me a holla in the comments, yo.  By the way, when I am bored I am not funny. You do the math.
