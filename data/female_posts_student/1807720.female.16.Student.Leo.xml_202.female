I did every question from the review booklet from every unit today.  So now I have like a million things to ask about stuff I am not sure about.  I am going for English help on Monday, and will go to the Bio review on Tuesday.  Wednesday I have to present our Drama final project.  Last night I went to Mat's house for dinner.  It was just the two of us, it was a candle lit dinner with rose pedals on the table.  He made the meal himself.  It was good and pretty nice of him to think of such a think.  I wasn't expecting it, and I was pretty surprised.  I am just worried about a few things.  I am pretty sure I am right too.  First of all, I am pretty sure he likes me for my looks, more than who I am.  He even said "I like you cause you look good, and I assume you think that same for me."  When he said that in my mind I was thinking 'Actually I like you for who you are on the inside, I don't pay attention to looks at all.'  The fact that like none of the guys liked me before last summer, but then I come back thinner then before and they all seem to like me.  Hmmm strange or coincidence, I will be the one to decided.  Then he also is going away for the summer and said "I can't wait to get back, you'll have lost even more weight"  I mean who does he think I am, some kind of super-I-can-loose-weight-really-easy-and-whenever-I-want.  I don't think so!!!  Just cause I lost 50 pounds before, doesn't mean I am going to loose anymore.  I am not trying to loose weight right now and I don't need to cause I look just fine the way I am.  So I think he only likes me for the way I look, that REALLY REALLY REALLY bothers me a lot.  I went out for an early dinner and then to see The Stepford Wives.  That was literally the only break I had from studying all day besides right now and taking a shower.  However, I am done for tonight.  Tomorrow I plan to read my Bio text books unit chapters - as many as I can get through in detail and know all the facts.  That is all I can really do for now, study, study, study, read, read, read, and ask questions.  And do my very best.  And I keep thinking how I got that Habits of Mind award thing for grade 11.  Oh how I worked my ass off for that.  It feels good in the end though.  To know my hard work and effort paid off.  It's a good feelings.  Anyways, so long blog until next time...
