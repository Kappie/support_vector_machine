What is interesting to me is the need and demand for online grocers currently.  Personally, I enjoy going to the grocery store, browsing the aisles trying to plan out meals for the week.  I like to look for bargains too.  So for me, the concept of ordering groceries online and having someone else pick them out seems kind of silly.  However, for people with disabilities or handicaps, ordering groceries online may be easier than making a trip to the store.  For the elderly and those who live secluded lifestyles, having groceries delivered could be a more reasonable option.
