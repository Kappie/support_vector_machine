So now I try to give more than I take n I bite my tongue, fight the urge to say its my way or no way at all n now I cherish love a whole lot more cuz of whats n the back of the bottom drawer  Dawg. That song just makes u member how life has changed you for the way your livin today.. Like in the song talkin bout past relationships.. I just dont wanna make the same mistakes I made w/ all the others cuz Justins definately the best chance I have ever recieved..  It was the summer n time was n a hurry And we couldnt grow up fast enough And n the back seat of ur car I gave u more than just my heart n we swore that it was love  This song makes me doubt everything. Its like this song talks bout movin all fast n thats exactly wat me n Justin did.   I guess theres just a part of me that likes to bring u down just to keep you around, cuz the day u that u realize how amazin u are ure gonna leave me  God. Everyday I fall deeper n love w/ him n Im soo scared that hes gonna find a better girl cuz he could def get better cuz hes like the perfect boyfriend.. sure he has his flaws.. but I dont care.. I love him soo much!!  yea.. dont ask... all those songs were n my profile n I wanted to replace my profile but I didnt wanna lose em..
