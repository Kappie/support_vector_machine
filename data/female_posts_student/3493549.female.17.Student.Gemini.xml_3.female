All those times I needed the Net for research, to await mails and simply to chat with friends. I miss coming here too; there were so many things I needed to say here.   I passed my driving test on Monday and the feeling was just so awesome. To finally get past that 'hurdle'...phew. Anyway, I was there with Shaun and Christobel and we met a couple of people there as well. Mostly their friends, so it was a bit awkward for me at first. I got to know this girl with a really unique accent, Emily, and this cute Norwegian guy, Kristien (I think that's how his name is spelt). Well, all of us passed except Christobel. She couldn't get past the slope, which was kinda scary. When it was Shaun and my turn, we were really freaked out. And it was raining and we were like the last ones to do the slope. Thankfully, all went well. Phew. Now, I await my license in silence. haha. Oh, Shaun is cute too. Not those typical cute guy, but cute nevertheless. I guess it's cuz he's always kidding around and being really nice and friendly.   My results arrived yesterday - exactly the same as 1st semester. -_- . I nearly got the perfect score I so crave for for Physics but it was not to be. I missed but a few decimal points. What in the world? I'll get my revenge this semester. Haha. And I also wanna make my Chem teacher proud. I don't know why. I just have to do really well for CHemistry. After all, isn't it my favourite subject? Also, maths. I can't let her down. Groanz. All the pressure.
