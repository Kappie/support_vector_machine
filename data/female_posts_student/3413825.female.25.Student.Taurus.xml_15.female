Well being the nicest mr. peacelover that he is, he said that he wasnt going to kill it. ok- i can understand that, but at least get it down, right? well because the damn thing was in a little corner -like most spiders are- he was hard to get down. I could not sleep knowing that this spider was possibly making babies and in the morning i would have to kill 12 not just 1 so I worked up enough nerve to kill the damn thing. Now, I feel bad because Pete is so sensitive when it comes to animals and insects. Animals are one thing, but insects- man i can smash an insect or spider in no time and not think twice about it--- or so i thought till now. So people tell me what you think. To kill the spider or not to kill the spider? One of my friends gave me a good recommendation and said get a glass jar and trap the spider in that and then slide a piece of paper up behind the back of the jar and the spider will fall in that and then you can throw him out. I think next time I will have to try that.
