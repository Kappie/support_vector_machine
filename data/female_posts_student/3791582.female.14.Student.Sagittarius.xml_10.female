I’ve been going back to the first nights, and the big fights and those quality quiet times when it was just you and me. and I like to explore the good days and the bad, when we knew we had a face across the hall or a number we could call if the worst that could happen did. And yea, some words got thrown around and we got off cue every once in awhile but damn, we had some fun times. You and I doubled over, laughing and kicking, instead of doing our homework at least twice a week.  And we all cried by moonlight and you messed up a few lines and we walked the quad a few times, just to clear our heads. so, summer will fix everything we let slip. So, fall will come with suitcases and blank pages and newly built bridges to cross. it won’t matter how we left or if we said perfect goodbyes, even if we said goodbye at all. We’ll be back again.  all work © smokeycustard
