The only one you can trust is the Lord. He knows how to treat you and he can be trusted with anything! So I am going to forgive all who have hurt me, forget it ever happened and just move on. No need to ponder anymore! I just hope that all of those I have hurt will forgive me as well! Ta-ta!          Much love, Brandi*    urlLink          urlLink
