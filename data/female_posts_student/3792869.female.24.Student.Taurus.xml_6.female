Surprisingly, I didn't feel the attraction anymore. Maybe I was too tired because I was running on about 3 hours of sleep or so. But for some reason, when we talked and hung out yesterday, I just felt like I was hanging out with one of my good friends. Parang magkabarkada na lang talaga kami. Thank God for the grace of moving on easily.  Well, maybe it's because I had a sucky day yesterday. Five minutes before I left the apartment I share with a two-faced, inconsiderate bitch, my roommate chose to "bother" me with a stupid concern of hers. She asked me if I could work in my room at night if I were to do some reading  (This entry was cut short because my friend/officemate Irene stopped by my cubicle and we ended up talking about relationships for the next hour or so. I found out she just broke up with her then-boyfriend 2 months ago. We ended up going out to dinner.)
