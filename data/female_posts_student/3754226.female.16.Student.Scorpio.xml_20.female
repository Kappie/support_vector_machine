For so long,  I have believed in something that wasn’t even there  It took me time to know and realize the truth,  It took me time before I was awaken from my stupidity,  It took me time before I was brought back to the harsh reality.   To those people – “that” guy and “that” girl,  They know who they are,  I hope I never see them  So that they wouldn’t have to face my fury.  I hope they live long enough to face their own karma.   Time will come,  They’ll be the ones believing in lies,  They’ll be the ones fooled,  They’ll be the ones feeling more than thrice the pain they’ve caused me,  They’ll be the ones, whose dreams will shatter,  They’ll be the ones unhappy,  They’ll be the ones miserable.   By that time,  I have gained the strength and have moved on,  Have forgotten what they did to me,  And have finally found the happiness they once took away from me.
