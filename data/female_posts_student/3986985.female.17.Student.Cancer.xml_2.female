Perhaps it's because i'm with people that i really want to be with... And i swear, it was a gimmick that people might turn down, coz like i said, it's really tiring and simple... IMAGINE THIS:     We just finished a test that was so dissapointingly easy ('coz i happen 2 study, which i rarely do) and we decided to have a bit of fun...watch sunset in Manila Bay. Unfortunately, it was only 10:30 in the morning so we decided to hit the mall, particularly the VIDEOKE and sing some out of tune songs... then we ate and headed to BAYWALK via PEDRO GIL, ofcourse, it would be a dumb idea to wait for the sunset coz it's only about 1:00 in the afternoon, so we headed to CCP...by foot and all...when we got there, we rented some bicycle, and ofcourse, ride it for 2 hours. We are grim by then because it was cloudy and actually drizzling and we are afraid that we won't be able to see the sunset. Anyway we pass the time biking. We got our hopes up, when, by four in the afternoon, we saw the cloud break and the sun peeping into the clouds... we decided to hit the road and wait for the sun to set... so once again, we walked...and walked... we were exhausted, nonetheless, we walked... halfway the manila bay, we gave up the thought of seeing the sun, coz it was too cloudy, although it wasn't raining, so we continue our walked and headed for the Boardwalk...(can u believe that from pedro gil to manila bay, then ccp, then boardwalk, not to mention the 2 hour bicycle ride!!) With little luck, aching feet and a enormous amount of stamina, we made it, at last, to the BoardWalk... We hastily buy some food and refreshments, 'coz for my part, i felt that i was about to collapse (joke). Anyway, we arrived there before six, and the sky is starting to darken already... when it was completely dark, we face the sea...or bay... and stare into oblivion, (which feels good...don't know why...) and meditated a little, chat a little (actually we chat N chat till we drop...) and finally decided to go home...     If u think that we finally came to our senses and ride back home...ur definitely wrong... 'coz by that time we no longer have money for our fare... so once again we walked... from boardwalk, we cross Luneta park, found our selves in UN ave. and finally my dormitory in which i abode... I was so tired and my feet aches a lot, but i didn't care... and did i mention that i happen to treat them with some fingerfoods and drinThat day for me was so special, that my friends and i decided to do it AGAIN, right folks, WE'LL DoTHAT WALK AGAIN, with more company, on monday afternoon...
