My parents woke me up from playing their loud 80s music at 11 AM, so I had no choice but to get off from my bed. ;_; Then my dad asked me if I wanted to go to the Center of Dallas to give my aunt a tour around it and stuff. So I went (yes, I actually went outside). I had fun, actually, but it made my poor little feet ache. We went to this place that had a bunch of stores inside this building, and we bought a couple of souvenirs for my aunt. I wanted to ride the DART Trains to see where they would take us, but we didn't know how far they'd take us and if they would ride back to Dallas. w00t for ignorance. So we didn't. Darn. We walked around some more, but it wasn't the time to do so 'cause it was so fuggin' hot and I was starting to get a headache. We decided to go to the aquarium just because. Holy crap, the line was huge! But we didn't have to wait for long because the line was moving fast. My sister kept being annoying and she wanted to be in my dad's arms the whole time. We can never have a fun time when my sis is around. Always ruining the fun.     I haven't gone to the aquarium for a long time. I think the last time I went was 3 and a half years ago. Yep. It was quite different from when I last went. I think they're gonna add sharks to it or something. But anyways, we saw theginormous (Â© of Sally)crocodile. It looked kinda fake, but then I saw it move. Oh my fuggin' goddess... you wouldn't believe how huge it was! It was just standing there, but still amazing. It's an endangered specie, and it's called the orinoco crocodile. Eh, yeah, that. And then there was another elephant-walrus-kind-of-thing, called the antillean manatee. So, yeah, I had fun.     I was hungry because I hadn't eaten anything for breakfast. My parents took us to this restaurant they had gone to before called T.G.I. Friday's. I had heard of it before but I had never been there. I ordered this plate that looked like orange chicken, but it was more sweet. It tasted so fuggin' good, but orange chicken is still better. ;P We were sharing and trading food, so more fun. Wheee.     We finally went home at 3.45 PM. Ah, at last, relaxation. As I was reading one of my favorite xangas to read, I find out about something that just made me so angry. Click  urlLink here to see what made my jealousy come out of my veins. Of course, if you're not a Conan O' Brien fan, then you'll just say, "What the heck is this?" Well dang it! Just look at that girl's face! 100% garden toolness! She doesn't deserve to see Conan backstage! Dang it! And just look at her xanga. No one can understand that crap! Horrible spelling and grammar. But anyways, I already took my anger out with Sally. Meh, hopefully we'll get to see Conan backstage, or even be on the show. Anyone can always dream, you know. ;P Funny thing is that on the first picture, that girl looks like Katie A. X_x;; No offense! XD I'm just saying. Sigh, curse you, girl-who-went-to-see-Conan-backstage! ;_;    I just finished watching the soccer match between Peru VS Argentina. Darn, Argentina won 1-0. How come all of the teams that I want them to win lose? Uruguay VS Argentina: Uruguay loses, Paraguay VS Brazil: Brazil loses. And now this game. What the fug? Mexico better not lose against Brazil, or I'll Ice Beam someone. I think right now Colombia is playing against Costa Rica. Meh, not gonna watch it. But! Tomorrow Mexico plays, so of course I'm gonna watch it, same thing with Paraguay VS Uruguay. w00t!     Also, I drew a picture of Mike S and I with the Ice Beam and Plasma Beam... he has the Plasma Beam and I'm holding the Ice Beam. Looks kick arse. You can click  urlLink here  to take a look at it.Whoa, this was a long entry. I think I'll stop here, hehe. XD Tomorrow I'm gonna go buy Four Swords Adventures, hopefully a new GCN Controller if my dad's in the mood, and the book When the Legends Die. Blah, boring book.
