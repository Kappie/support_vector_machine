Anyway, Jenny and I decided that we want to play Dungeons and Dragons, just to see what's with it. Jenny said Monica would play too. It's my job to figure out exactly how we'd go about playing it, since I'm the one with unlimited resources (read: internet).  Jenny's like, "I'm a nerd, but without the pocket protector...I have the braces, though!" I tried to do my nerd laugh, but I screwed it up since my throat is sore. It amuses me to no end that that's my stepdad's real laugh. He laughs like a nerd. Anyway, I told her that I have the glasses, so together, we make a whole nerd.  Sunburn news: It's still blistered, beneath the skin. You can see the bumps but they aren't surfacing. It still itches on the edges, but it's getting better. And my cleavage is about a thousand times better.  We have another carwash next Saturday at WAL-MART! I think I'll wear a different top, or POSSIBLY keep my t-shirt on. I wanted to wear a thin white shirt and wet myself down on Thursday but all my white shirts went in June's Great Drawer Purge.  I still need to start Dae's necklace. No more procrastinating!
