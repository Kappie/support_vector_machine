Lani said that I should spend time with myself because then I will figure out who I am!  Because right now I don't know who I am!  I don't have a set personality, I have multiple!  They change depending on who I am hanging out with!  ... How pathetic is that?  I shouldn't have to change myself just to make people happy! I was talking to Lani, and I told her that I wanted to be lovable!  Well, not lovable because I'm not ready for love, but likable, because I want Bob to like me!  Lani told me that if I have to change myself to make someone like me then it isn't meant to be!  During chorus today we watched The Nightmare Before Christmas and The Breakfast Club!  Two amazing movies!  Mrs. Minger bought us donuts and they were really yummie!  I love them!  Yay! After school Charlotte gave me and Amanda a ride to my house and yeah!  It was fun because we got to ride in her convertable, and the wind blowing in our hair was just so much fun!  Me and Amanda made a pizza and tanned outside for about an hour!  We put heart shaped stickers on our stomachs so we could see the change!  THERE IS A CHANGE!  I have a baby tan line!  Woo Hoo!  It really excites me!  Then we just sat around my house for a really long time!  That was the end of my wonderful day!  It was a lot of fun, I love spending time with Amanda!  This morning I burnt my ear on my straightener!  And then just like a couple minutes ago I took my earings out of my ear, and scratched it and all this blistered, pussy skin came off!  It was really disguesting!  Why, why me?!
