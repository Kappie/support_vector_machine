You see, in the past, some of them have come to town and had sex with a lot of people... and just left, with no committment.  My parents have always warned to stay away from the "wheaties"... I've lived a sheltered life.  But this year, for some reason, my friend and I talked to a couple of them.  One, named Brenton, was extremely cute... and sweet and everything i've ever looked for in a guy.  He and I are now together despite him leaving to continue with his job.  We talk on the phone 2 or 3 times a day... and he'll be back through in about 5 months... I just thought i'd tell ya about him. :D
