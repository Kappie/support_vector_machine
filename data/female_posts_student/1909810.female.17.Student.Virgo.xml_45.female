And I think I'm finally over my 13 year old little girl crush on Nash.  He's hilarious and I love him, but I've realized I'm done with the whole obsessive...wierd...thing.   We open in about a week, and most of the cast isn't even off book. That's kind of scary.  Oh well though, what can ya do?  After finishing a painting from last week I started a new one that's looking pretty nifty, I'm quite proud, but it's unfinished, and I don't know when I'll be able to finish it...it was inspired by my current self dissapointment that I had ever quite playing the violin.   and uhh...  my cat chases cars.
