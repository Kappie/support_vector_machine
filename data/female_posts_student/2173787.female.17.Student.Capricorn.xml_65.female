Most likely I would enjoy option A much much more than option B, but the unknown calls me.  I love the shelter of my box, but at times it seems to imprison me.  Why does it seem that I always must choose which side of the wall to be on? There should be some way for me to have both, yet I know that there isn't.  I think I'm making this bigger than it has to be.
