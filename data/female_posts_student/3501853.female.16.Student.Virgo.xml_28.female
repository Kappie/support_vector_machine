It all fell apart today though. Lunch was hard as usual. 8th is when things started falling apart again. Something that me and Ana were talking about in study reminded me of k and I got all upset cuz it reminded me of a good memory and I had to hold tears back. Afterschool I went by my locker and r went by me for like 2 seconds and I tried to be really nice because I want him to realize that I am making an effort to change but then he left and I called him and asked if I could get a ride so I could spend more time with him and he said no but it was understandable but I was sitting down in the front and the tears just came cuz I was thinking of me and k then of me and r and Dan came by me for a while but then r came so I wiped my eyes off and ya..me and him don't talk anymore, I don't know what to do, I want to prove to him that I've changed but it's like I don't deserve a 2nd chance and maybe I should leave him alone if that's what he wants cuz I don't want to do anymore harm than I"ve already done, it was all my fault and I understand that he probably doesn't want to be friends anymore. Then I walked home to think things out and I come home and I read j's journal and before I read this journal I thought he just needed a break so I gave him his space then I read it. I read my worst flaws written down for me. That's when I lost it. I didn't do anything to say sorry because I thought he wanted a break so that's what I gave him. Everything he said, I guess is right about me and it hurts, hurts so fucking bad. I seriously don't feel like being here, I'm SOO sick of myself. When I lost friends earlier this year, honestly, it didn't hurt as much as all of this is. This changed me and as much as I know this is true, no one is going to believe me after all of this. Honestly, it took this to make me realize and I'm changing. I'm not looking for other people to replace these 3. I can't find anyone to replace them. But I just don't know what to do anymore, I hate myself for who I am...
