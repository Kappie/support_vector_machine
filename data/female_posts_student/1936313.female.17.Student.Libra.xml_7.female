(I swear.. sleeping past 11:00am is not sleeping in so long as that does not mean sleeping more than 10 hours. I got a healthy 9 so there!)  Went out for coffee with Megs, which is always always always a good thing... unload, rewind and start fresh.. good stuff. Went shopping... heh.. shoppings the natural healer.. and hmm.. walked... hehe.. walking is also a good thing. I miss walking. I miss a lot of things. I miss rain. Boo to snow! hehe.. its supposed to rain a lot while we're in England so by the time I get home I'll be saying Boo to April Showers.  Boo to homework! I did absolutely nothing this weekend, I have so much homework to do! Gah its terrifying.. I'll weigh the plane down with the weight of it all...well that or my overall spirits... or both. Its 3 days as of tomorrow. 3 days!! Woo! I have 3 days... gah.. alright now I can panic..  I think the pets know we're leaving.. they're rebelling an awful lot lately... Maple broke out of her kennel again... as if that wasn't bad enough.. she also broke through the wood fence and into the neighbors yard. Thats twice this week. The cats, haha.. I don't know which of them is doing it but they're climbing the curtains again and dragging them down. They do it at night while we're sleeping, you spend half an hour each morning fixing it. Stupid cats. (I don't mean that, I love my kitties.)
