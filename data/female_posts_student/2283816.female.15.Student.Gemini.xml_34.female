I have several theories as to why this is.  1)  I'm bored.  I don't wish to pay attention to my surroundings and instead lose myself in thought, which invariably leads back to my stories. 2)  God wants me to pay more attention in Mass and so punishes me for not doing so by giving me a bunch of good ideas that I can't write down, leaving me with the feeling of DAMMIT, WHY COULDN'T I JUST REMEMBER THE DAMN PENCIL.  3)  The atmosphere and deep thinking get my creative juices flowing and inspired.   I think it's a nice combination. Whatever it is, someday I think I should try writing in church. Not during a Mass, just coming in one day and sitting and thinking. I've gotten MOST of my good ideas there.
