IN THE WORLD. liz needs to marry alex cause he makes her insanely happy, and there needs to be no stupid parents/cops/authority and everyone needs to be in love, and everyone needs to have good food and be happy. And there should be no prejudice and no starvation and blah blah blah, world peace.  My hair is a really ugly color and i have bad self esteem and i am annoying and boring and stupid. im going to turn into all those stupid girls i hated at fairview, so ill shut the fuck up.  ::sigh::  i cant wait for june to come back, i want to hang out with her a lot.. that girl is insane and cool  goddamn kye....  im really thinking a lot right now. even though i am so damn stoned. alex and jessie are just sitting around, talking and talking about just... stuff. i feel like when i talk to someone, i dont really talk to them. or i just seem to be stuck in a bubble, and i'm quiet and alone and away.  i dont know, whatever. That shit's annoying.  i guess thats it... i wish dylan was here...im emo  -abby
