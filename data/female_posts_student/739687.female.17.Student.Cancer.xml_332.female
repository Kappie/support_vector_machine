He told me that the sonogram was TOTALLY normal, and yet he wants to do a day surgury to diagnose me for something I KNOW THAT I DON'T HAVE.  How on earth does it make any sense?  And then it would require some six month treatment that would be like a shot every week and a daily pill.  Then after the treatment, there's a good possiblity that I'd never be able to have kids. All for something I don't have.  I mean, and it's completely obvious to me that I don't have it. When he told me about it and gave me all the info on it I was like "We're talking about ME and MY symptoms, right?" And he was like "yeah.."  Oh well...he's retarded.  No, I'm not pregnant you retarded douche-bags.  Sorry...I'm not feeling good...I'm gonna go to bed now.  Adios crazies and fools.
