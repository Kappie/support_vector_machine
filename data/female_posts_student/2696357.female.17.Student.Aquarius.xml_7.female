Seriously though, eyes are like the coolest thing about a person.  You can uncover an unbelievable amount of info just by gazing into their eyes.  *sigh*  Anyways, school was for the most part, uneventful.   Sam, Kevin, and I never talk anymore, which isn't surprising.  Physics was kinda cool...if you like walking in 95 degree heat looking at transformers while dodging a billion noisy cicadas in high heels.  History was "interesting" because I happened to wear a tight aqua halter dress...and I'm positive the guys noticed.  Chris came up to me and was like "hey, its amy...my favorite girl in history" and rajai immediately started teasing me. Even though our rough draft is due on thursday, I did absolutely nothing in that class.  (I have an A!!!!)   Therefore, I spent the entire class period chatting it up with Seth, who I think is adorable.   In fact, he doesn't have a date to prom either, and his b-day is even on prom!! AWWWW :)   I'd go with him.   Hahaha, we talked about my crazy dance schedule and he was like you must be really flexible...i was like hehe, yeah...is that a bad thing *wink*    Ohh, and last night, I talked to Tom until like 12 in the morning.  He seems pretty cool: he plays hockey, the guitar, writes, is going to U of Wisconsin, and works at clydes.  Besides being cute, he wants to hang out on friday, which is cool.  I'll inform you of the details when I talk to him tonight :)  *~later hun!~*
