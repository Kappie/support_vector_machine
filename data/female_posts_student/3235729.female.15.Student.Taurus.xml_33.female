Apparently it was in the hallway. =  Mr. Adams: Well, how did you know it was Jodi's?  Mr. VanD: I just counted the safety pins, and I knew it was hers.   and then me and Lindsay had this deadly conversation about the safety pins and how VanD's the safety pin nazi.   Me: So...it's like..."There's 44 safety pins here. It can't be Jodi's. She always has 45. Kill the bastard that this binder belongs to!"  Lindsay: Hahaha. No binder for you!   Yeah...=/  But so today after school me Lindsay and Ashley decided to go 'Bus-trotting.' just riding the bus until it makes a full circle and just watch things. It's really entertaining. So on the bus I was being loud and obnoxious-like, and Lindsay's like "hoh! Look out the window! The little man!" Now. She was pointing to a painting of a little man on a window. I thought she was talking to some guy standing at the cross walk. So I said really loudly "HOH! HE SLICED OFF HIS HAAAND!!! BUT...NOT REALLY." Then Lindsay's like "...you're an idiot. I don't even know you!" And this guy sitting at the front of the bus turns around and like laughs at me (I think he thought I was talking to him) Then we get downtown and the bus driver comes to the back n is like "Where you guys going?" And we weren't going to say oh we'll just wait for the bus to make a full circle. So Lindsay's like "Erm...Ashley's house." "Where's that?" "Erm...I don't really know." So. We got kicked off. But. I think the reason she kicked us off was because A) She thought we were harrassing that guy, and B) We were being pretty loud. But. It's her job to tolerate obnoxious teenagers!!! She drives a public bus for fuck sake's!! anyways so we just ended up walking around downtown and we went to Carma chameleon, Uforia and some book store. Oh and this deadly candy store. Where I "got" the deadliest thing ever!! It's like a spiderman whistle dealy!
