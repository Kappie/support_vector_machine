I hate it when friends get demoted to acquaintances.  I hate having to make big decisions about my future that may involve pissing people off.  I hate conflict, really.  I hate Prarie Home Companion.  I hate it when people lie to me.  I hate broken promises.  I hate not understanding things.  I love Matt.  I love my friends.  I love sunny days.  I love chocolate ice cream.  I love knowing what is going on in my life.  I love being in control (but only to a certain extent).  I love opening my mailbox and finding real mail.  I love knowing secrets.  I love that I get to travel all over the world.
