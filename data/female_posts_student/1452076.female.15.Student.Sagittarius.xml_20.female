And I'm here to join in the fad. To check out the rush. In exchange, my life is put on the display board.  My blog title is actually adapted from the Jim Dunlop motto - 'Live To Play Live'. Was just browsing through their website and was especially attracted to the picks section. Many famous stars use Dunlop picks for their style of playing too. Metallica, Hoobastank, Korn, Avril Lavigne, Linkin Park, Blink 182, DefTones, Sum 41, AudioSlave, Good Charlotte, just to name a few.
