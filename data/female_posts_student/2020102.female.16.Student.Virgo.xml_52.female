I love it. :) So everyone should listen to it sometime.   Hello I've waited here for you Everlong  Tonight  I throw myself into And out of the red out of her head she sang  Come down and waste away with me Down with me Slow out you wanted it to be Over my head, out of my head she sang  And I wonder When I sing along with you If everything could ever feel this real forever If anything could ever be this good again The only thing I'll ever ask of you You've got to promise not to stop when I say when She said  Breathe out So I can breathe you in Hold you in  And now I know you've always been Out of your head out of my head i sang  And I wonder When I sing along with you If everything could ever feel this real forever If anything could ever be this good again The only thing I'll ever ask of you You've got to promise not to stop when I say when She said  And I wonder If everything could ever feel this real forever If anything could ever be this good again The only thing I'll ever ask of you You've got to promise not to stop when I say when  -Foo Fighters, "Everlong"
