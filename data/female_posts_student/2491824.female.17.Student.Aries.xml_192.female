(It's one of those magazines that you find in hotels, and it tells about the "shopping, dining, and entertainment" in and around D.C.) And I'm looking at all the listings for art galleries and art shows and museums and the like...  Ugh, This makes me so depressed.  I wish I had my license or knew someone else who likes to just wander around looking at art and old stuff. Blah.  Blah ....BLAH!...
