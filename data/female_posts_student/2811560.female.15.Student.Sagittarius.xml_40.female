I know I got a 1 on my solo, and I didn't see what Laura and I got on our duet, but I'm just going to assume we got a 1. Come on, its me and Laura Waters. How could we not get a 1? Anyways, the judges were really stupid. They talked forever and ever, and then practically wrote books on the comment sheets, so each room was running like an hour behind. Crazy. So yesterday, we had our first read-through for Anything Goes. Some people in the cast can barely read. Not kidding. It was...bad. And you know what I found out? Not only does Noah have to kiss me, he also has to slap my ass! Wow, how wonderful is that? And I thought the kissing was bad. Man this play is going to be interesting!
