Also, today was exciting because I got to see Paul for the first time, yay! He's so cool, I'm really glad I met him. I wonder if he's reading this...that would be awkward...Hi Paul! Lol. So anyway, I really hope that baritone player comes, we really need him. So, in conclusion, a very good day, and with marching band, its only about to get better!
