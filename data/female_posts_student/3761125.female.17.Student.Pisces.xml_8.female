You don't realize you've fallen asleep until you wake up the next morning?  This is essentially what this album does.  As soon as you press the play button, it takes you on a psychedelic journey that you only realize you've been on when the last song stops.  It's like waking up suddenly when the alarm goes off in the morning.  The only difference, unlike sleep, is you can go back to the beginning right away and go again.  In other words, this is a complete mindfuck of an album.  	The Secret Machines have been compared to rock Gods: Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd to name the main two.  While I can see some very vague similarities, there definitely aren't any that really stand out.  Pink Floyd began that "sonic landscape" sound; that haunting, progressive beauty.  And I think that if anything, TSM are similar but only in that sense.  In certain tracks, two in particular: "Leaves Are Gone" as well as "Pharaoh's Daughter", one can hear a certain quality that resembles Pink Floyd... mostly in the guitars as well as the melodic, space-out sounds.  It made me think OF Floyd but it definitely didn't make me think this IS Floyd.  There's a distinct difference.    	Track 5- "The Road Leads Where It's Led" is slightly touching-the-surface-of-Zeppelin but other than that, there are no similarities at all except possibly when vocalist Brandon Curtis sings.  His voice is't so much suggestive of Robert Plant, but rather it works a similar character in certain songs and key moments on the album.  	One thing I want to mention about this album is that it isn't exactly consistent throughout.  That's not exactly a bad thing in this case though.  While other well-known albums such as Radiohead's  Ok Computer  or Pink Floyd's  The Wall  sustain similar sounds throughout, this sounds different with each song.  I happen to love it and it definitely keeps me interested (wouldn’t normally with just any band but these guys make inconsistency perfectly all right.)	  Overall, this is an excellent album.  I can honestly say it's one of the best of the year; definitely my favorite so far and I can’t see a better album possibly coming out before the year-end.  It's such a good balance between dreamy soundscapes and at the same time, rocking you to the point where you're breathless and amazed.  These guys bring back passion and they bring back power to an age where packaged radio crap is doing so well (WHY?).   So please, dear reader, if you're into catchy drum beats, dark guitar riffs, desperate-almost-haunting and hypnotic vocals, buy  Now Here is Nowhere ...  as soon as you can.
