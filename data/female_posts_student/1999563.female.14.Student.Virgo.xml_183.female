So I felt like no one should love me because I am such a horrible person. ALl my sins were weighing me to far down. So I just spent all morning trying to mold myself into  a better person.  It worked...kinda of. I was still so depressed.  Then I get to rowing. First...ther eis this girl on my rowing team. Her name is Andee. She is the nicest girl alive and she was always SUPER happy. I will always remember her smiling! So I get to rowing and Allyson tells me that her mom came to rowing and asked everyone if they knew where she was. She is missing. All her parents could find was her wallet. She is only 17. Now the police and everyone are searching for her. I am so scared. She was such an awesome person.  So that whole thing made me realize how precious life is. I know I will die, that time is not that far away. But in my death I want to change the world.  I don't want to die and have no one remember me. I want people to remember me because I was a christian.   *sigh*  I love my life, I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.  peaceroni.
