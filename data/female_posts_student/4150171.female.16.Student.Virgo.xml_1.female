I haven't wrote in awhile, I think I have suffered from a slight case of writers block. Or Maybe the Cubs losing the pass 2 series, has just made     me feel like shit. It Might be because my Birthday is Monday, and it will probably be shitty. I have been able to take a "Vacation", Just laying around all weekend watching the Olympics, and crying about the Cubs. Monday its back to School which I am kinda Happy About, and bc me and Katie have a awesome parking spot.       Happy Birthday Andy which was The 17th and Maura Which was The 16th.
