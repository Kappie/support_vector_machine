It takes a lot to have to ask your friends and family to help out, but in the end it is for a great cause.  I am so happy to have her on our team.  THANKS MICA!  I can't blog too long tonight.  I have to get up early to make the drive down to Carlsbad.  Bailey and I will be speaking at a rally.  I am actually pretty excited.  Wish us luck!  Hope you are all having a great week...no word on Bailey yet.  He has an ultrasound scheduled for next week.  He is still swollen but it doesn't seem to affect him.  BLAH!
