Tomorrow’s genius’s and leaders, inventors, and only the lord knows what else.  School, from your local Jr. College to tech school, to the $16,000 a semester it costs to go to Baylor University –that’s a flat rate from what I hear- school is that thing that drives our world forward, with promises of a better tomorrow.    So why, when school is so damned important to the world’s future, are so many states raising the roof on the cost of learning?  Deregulating tuition, I know that the Jr. College I go to is about to have a hike in tuition from the modest $170.00 (approx.) a semester hour to something like $225.00 a semester hour.  When did the cost of knowing, learning, and growing as a person get so large?  Whose idea was this?    The future is not looking so good, when you run all those with the drive to learn out of school for lack of the ability to pay the overpriced, exorbitant cost of a few classes here and there, what are we left with?  McDonalds and Dairy Queen, maybe –if you’re extremely lucky- you will learn a trade that will be useful for years to come.  Otherwise, learning is on the downswing.  I ask this, when did learning become a fad?  I live in a state that preaches EDUCATION!!! Cry’s its praises from the roof tops, good ol’ Texas!  Still, when it comes down to it, I wonder what they are doing to back that up?  Its Texas who is deregulating college tuition, giving colleges the right to charge what they want, which makes all us popper’s who can’t afford it scowl in disbelief.  Now don’t get me wrong, I love the state of Texas.  They were one of the firsts to enact testing to be able to graduate High School.  While this may be true, I find myself shaking my head, other countries –including the quite scandalous France- have been testing their students for years.  In the end I am left with a bitter taste in my mouth for legislators, their overpaid salaries, and Mercedes in the drive.  If they did what they were supposed to do, fight for the people, they would never be deregulating college tuition.  They would be mindful of the future of the world.  Without students –a population that decreases steadily by the year- the future will be dim.  ~Kristyn
