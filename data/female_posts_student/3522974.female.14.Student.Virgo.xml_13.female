I had a dream in english that i fell down a well, everything else is kind of a blur, then i remember something prodding me, then a really violent prod. I heard a distant person say "Stop that Ellen", i woke up to see Ellen and Mrs. Atmore staring down at me. The bell had gone and i gathered my books and scuttled off to the next desk to sleep on.  Why is it that I always have dreams in english not maths? Is it something to do with mrs atmore's soothing voice? Odd. Maybe it is bcoz in maths whenever i drift away to another dimension i can always feel Hannah drawing towns (you heard me) on my arms and face... Neway, i am so buggered. My daily routine is get up, got to school, come home and watch angel, miss the last half of Angel because i fall asleep, watch buffy, miss the last half buffy bcoz i fall asleep again, then have dinner, and fall asllep again in front of the TV. What really annoys me is when i fall asleep during angel, and my bro comes up to me and takes the remote from my tight grasp, and wen i finally wake up, he has tyaken over the TV.  Do not think i am really obsessed with TV. It's just we got robbed and the insurance company has finally coughed up a new TV, after like 3 months, so i was like entertainment-deprived for so long, now that i have the TV bak i never wanna leave it.  (*Yawn...*) I can't wait for dinner. The best things in life begin with 'f's. Eg.  Food, Friends, Family, Fun,  and i suppose  the Father . ehe. I fank the farva for these few fings. ehe. that is so lame. luv kc. I cant remember wot i was writing bout...
