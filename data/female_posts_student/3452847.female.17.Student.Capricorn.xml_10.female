From him when i got out the car, he was leaning over and i just said thanks and have fun at the practise, and i got a sad, kind of smile, and i just wanted to hug him... Aww, i miss him soooooooooooooo much its mad, and i miss him more the more time i spend with him, yet i still wana spend time with him, and i have Carlos texting me and Dave, and then all i want is the one thing that is the furthest to get... So close but so far as they say, well i've got an inset day Fri, then work Sat and Sun, then college until Thurs and Fri when i have work shadowing, then i have three days of careers stuff then two days at college then three days of college and two days in France, then three days and we leave, thank fuck! Looks long but not long to go now...   ~Lisa~
