I must admit when I first arrived and I saw everyone cheering I thought to myself "What the heck have I gotten myself into?" Then by the end of the day I was cheering right along with everyone! Some cheers include:   To Be Enthusiastic...  To be enthusiastic, you must act enthusiastic! To be enthusiastic, you must act enthusiastic! To be enthusiastic, you must act enthusiastic!

Song leader lines: A guy and a girl They had a date. So they got in a car And drove to the lake. They went for a swim Up popped a fin And there were the sharks! Chorus: (the crowd should follow the actions of the leader and do the "doot" thing after the song leader shouts his or her line here.) Papa Shark! Mama Shark! Brother Shark! Baby Shark! Grandpa Shark!  They swam real fast. They swam real far. It didn't help 'Cause there were the sharks!  Repeat Chorus  They took the arm. They took the leg. The other arm, The other leg. They took the head And all was red And now they're dead... Because of the sharks!  Repeat Chorus   There are a couple more cheers but I figured that this was enough for now. But as you can tell just by cheers listed here and the stuff in other entries its is obvious that I have had a freakin amazing weekend. A weekend that I will never forget in my entire life. I just want to say one thing to every 2004 ambassador and person who reads this just remember : "No matter where we go or what path we take in life, we always take a little bit of each other everywhere" And I find this true, everyone whom I met this weekend and worked with I will always carry a piece of you in my hearts, you are all extremely special to me in a different way and I love you all for that. Thanks for an amazing weekend and thanks for bringing me out of my comfort zone. Keep in touch. Love to all! ~Melissa
