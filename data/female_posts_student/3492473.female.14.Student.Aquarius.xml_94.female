I went online around 2 am and Carly was like the only person online so we chatted for a bit and she went to bed. So I got bored and went to bed too. At that time it was like a quarter to three. My mom came and woke me up at like 9. It was hell. I didn't wanna get up at all. And  my body hurt like a bitch  so I was having trouble moving around, sitting, and what not. I ate, got ready, and left to go to the mall and other places with my sister and my mom. OMG! My hair is  really light.  I started using Sun-In like a week ago and it's already made my hair super lighter than what it was. First, the three of us went to the library because my mom needed to return some books and get some more and I had to get Tom Sawyer to read. I wasn't too excited about that. I didn't know where to look so I asked a lady for help. She led me into the  children's section  as I was thinking to myself,  "Why would a kid wanna read Tom Sawyer?"  She found it and I walked away once I thanked her. A few minutes later I was looking through the book  only to find extremely large print and pictures.  That's when I realized it was an adapted version. So I had to go back and ask her to help me find the real copy. She looked but said they didn't have any. I got pissed and my mom was looking through the adult section for it. In the end, she wound up finding it. So that's good. I haven't started it yet. Everyone says it's really boring so I can't wait. My mom got the Da Vinci Code and Gretchen suggested I read it so I'm gonna read that once I finish Tom Sawyer and the other book I started a few days ago. It seems good. It's a murder mystery I guess.  It's just really long.  If you haven't realized, I love reading. I ended up getting some movies too so it's all good. After that, we went to the mall. All I got was " panties " (Margaret always calls them that so I thought I'd try it. I like "underwear" better) from Victoria's Secret and lunch at that chicken place.  It was really good.  Margaret and I were like totally crazy today. We were  trying the underwear on over our clothes  so see if it'd fit and just acting completely stupid. Oh well, it was fun and it was a real womanly bonding day. I came home and Annie called so I called her back. I was gonna ask her to come over but she called me and asked me to go over her house so I was like whatever.  I was all pimped out in a Papa Joe's Subs t-shirt and athletic sports. I was one sexy bitch!  LoL. But I did look cute! I was only wearing baggy clothes because it made my sun burn feel even worse if tight clothes were rubbing against it. So I went to her house and we chilled. Tracy came over a little later. They were gonna go up to Orlando but I didn't feel up to it so I just went home. It was nice because Tracy said, "Well we want you to go." On my way home I saw my soccer coach and I was like shit! Then he told me I shouldn't be walking, I should be running and I was like I was seriously gonna do it but I think I'm getting my shin splints back so I'm giving them a break. Seriously. My shins hurt soo bad. LoL, so here I am. Talking online. I'm gonna go watch Road Rules at ten so I'll be back later! muah~
