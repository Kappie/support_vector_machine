Thank God Nick was strapped in his car seat in the middle of the back seat and not right behind the drivers seat or he could have been really hurt. Shawn  Nick are ok. The other vehicle doesn't even have a scratch on it! My Toyota Echo is obviously not great in accidents!  Hopefully ...It's considered totaled and we can get a better family car!!!  Last night Shawn  I finally completed Nick's hand and foot prints in clay and mounted it on the wall in a frame.   Only 19 1/2 hours until Shawn leaves =(   Tomorrow is our 2 year wedding anniversary!!! SOmetimes it seems like we got married yesterday and other times it feels like*in a good way*we've been together forever!
