Why do they jump to say "I love you"  I just don't get it  Love isn't a word to throw around  It's sacred, special, secretive  When you're in love, you don't get jealous  You don't focus on sec, or making out  You are kind, merciful, forgiving  You would sacrifice anything for that person  Love can come in many shapes  sizes  Friendship love, Family love, Romantic love  Why do people rely on lying, cheating  hurting  others just to get some materialistic treasure?  I'm not saying I'm perfect, I know I've made mistakes  But I try, I fail, I cry, I hurt, I love  Blood, sweat,  tears...'tis life for some  But for others life is love, butterflies,  flowers  who doesn't like presents  gifts?  But should you really focus your life, love   relationships on getting presents?  I just want to know why people walk on eggshells  Why do they hurt others for their own benefits?  Why can't they realize what they're doing, who they're  hurting?  I hope I never deliberately hurt someone to make  myself feel better  I wish people would just live, without worrying  about who's hot and who's not  I guess I'll just sit here, in love,  wonder why  I love you
