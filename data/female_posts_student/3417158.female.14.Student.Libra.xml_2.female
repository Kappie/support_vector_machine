WE'RE ONLY 14! WE HAVE OUR WHOLE LIFE AHEAD OF US! you  cannot  tell me that you've already 'experienced' everything and that you're already ready to stop the whole dating/relationships thing at age 14, you make me laugh! our world of guys and exploring our feelings is just beginning! it frustrates me that some people want to grow up too fast, so they get involved with all that at a young age, make some bad choices, then call it quits when high school is just beginning. none of my friends will grow up with me, because they claim they already have...thats bullshit! one of my friends is trying to keep me from making the mistakes she made, when i  know  im smarter than her...my love life is just beginning, when hers has already ended because of her bad choices...i absolutely love her and support her and sympathize with her, but i can't relate. i just want someone who is in my position to relate to me...who's life is just beginning...plz
