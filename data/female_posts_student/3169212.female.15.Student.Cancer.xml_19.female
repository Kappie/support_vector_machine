Kurama was politely snickering, trying to cover it with his hand while Hito flat out laughed her head off, and Hiei just raised his eyebrow with the always angry expression.  (Hey, that's as close to laughing that you can get from the shadow apparition.)  "Why is it always a pun?!" Baka shouted furiously.  "Maybe...," Hito stopped to try and catch her breath, but it was a hopeless cause, "maybe it's because your name is Idiot!"  Another round of laughter pierced the normal serene silence of the forest.  "My name is not Idiot!  It's Baka!"   "Same difference!" Hito continued to laugh.  "Errr..."  Baka shook her tight-clenched fist.  "Don't take it personally, Baka.  It's just you have to admit that it is pretty funny," Kurama tried as a comforting remark.  "Jeez...  That makes me feel a whole lot better," she rolled her eyes with the sarcastic remark.  She then hit Kurama in the head, followed by Hito, with a fan that just seemed to appear out of thin air.  "Ow!" they said together.  "I'm feelin' better now," Baka commented with a satisfied smile on her face while she gave them all the peace sign.  "Where'd that come from?" Hito asked, rubbing her head where Baka had wacked her.  "I'll never tell," Baka responded in an eerie sing-song voice.
