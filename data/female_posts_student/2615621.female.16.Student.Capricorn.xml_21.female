Overall today was just great...i understood alg 2, which is good for me since i can't do math haha and then Drama went well, i got to run around, be loud, and talk all i wanted to!! Lunch was better, i could finally eat. lol When i like a guy its hard for me to eat in front of them unless they're like one of my bestest buddies like andrew, andrew, trevor, zack, aaron, ect. My normal boys. And then i liked Jordan and he always sat near me at lunch, the table beside mine, facing me..eeek. lol i just couldnt eat. But since i dont like jordan like that anymore and i was tired of sitting through Hon World History hungry, i ate. lol Hon World History took forver and i basically just sat there. I still have about 75% of my World Map to draw and lable, oh and color oh and study. haha i'm screwed. Spanish went good today, we had about 30mins+ of free time and since katie was gone, and hate to say it..but even catherine wood was gone, i had no one to talk to but andrew gitt and preston. Hey, that's not all that bad. haha We talked about driving and stuff and Preston explained his sketchbook to me. :D lol he's so hot. He has a really pretty smile. I did get my report card today and well..it sucks...as usual, but jordan went to get his at the same time and he was standing right beside me and couldnt even look at me or say hey..uh ok thanks jordan. so i elbowed him lol he elbowed me back...stupid fuck. he can go suck a fuck. lol Today in drama i got to be a thug and look for some spinners. yay!! lol it wasnt one of those things that are planned...i suddenly took on the role of a thug who wanted spinners. It was prob one of the first roles where i havent died laughing and gone outta character. I was proud lol . I HOPE IT SNOWS TOMORROW!!! :D
