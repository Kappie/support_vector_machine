	 
      i'm sorry
i've hurt you
it's all my fault
i don't know what to do
there's nothing i can say
i can see your pain
but i can't relieve it
i caused it
and there's no going back
i can't say it aloud
because if i do 
you'll know
that i know
i want to hug you
to hold you tight
but i know you'd push me away
you should
because it's my fault
oh god,
i'm sorry
