This helps to cut down on the cost and provides more servings per person. It also improves the flavor because, no matter how much you might want them to, meat analogues never taste exactly like the foods they are imitating.  Having said that, the following two recipes feature my favorite Yves Ground Round as the star player. The first recipe is from Deborah Wolfe, who hosts the vegan recipe board at VegSource. The second, I got from a Yahoo! cooking list. The source is unknown.   Salisbury Steak :  1 8oz. tube  hamburger-style  GimmeLean 1 cup Yves Ground Round 1/4 cup bread crumbs 1/2 teaspoon onion powder 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder Your favorite brown gravy  Mix together the first five ingredients. Form into oval burgers. Brown the burgers on both sides in a lightly sprayed, heavy frying pan over medium heat. Add a 1/4 cup of water, cover, and simmer gently for about 1o minutes, or until heated through. Water should be evaporated. If not, uncover and cook another few minutes until water is gone. Add the prepared gravy and cook gently for 5 more minutes.  Makes 5 - 6 steaks.      SDA Mini 'Meatloaves' :     1 cup dry tvp mixed w/ 3/4 cup + 2 tablespoons hot water OR I package Yves Ground Round 'hamburger' crumbles     Add and mix well: 1 cup tomato sauce 1 cup fork-mashed potatoes [can use cold leftovers, too] 1 cup rolled oats 1 tablespoon dried minced onion or 1 teaspoon onion powder 1 teaspoon oregano or Italian seasoning 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder Salt and pepper to taste     Pack mixture into 8 lightly-sprayed muffin or custard cups. Bake in a preheated 350F oven for 25-30 minutes. Wait 5 minutes before removing from cups.     *Note* - I use Yves crumbles to make this recipe and I don't add any salt because I find the crumbles are sufficiently salty.
