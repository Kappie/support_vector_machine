When I take out the trash the door is usually left open, so thats where the guy would slip in. I figure out where he would hide and such. Sometimes I think I'm more likely to get cornered outside, but then I have to ask myself what would I do? I decided running to the gas station would be the easy thing to think of, but im not a great runner due to...  muscle contracture . Or I could try to lock myself in my car, which is always near... since I lock it though (to prevent people from hiding in the backseat while im gone) it would take some pretty calm and agile hands to get in AND lock it before I'm dead. And then there's all those scenes from various movies where the helpless girl fumbles with her keys while the killer slowly moves in.  Reguardless, if the guy got into the building I'd be screwed. I wouldn't hear him because of the loud music. He'd wait till the vacuuming part, then come up behind me and do one of those killing things where I die. Thats not the scarey part though, cause then the CSI come in. I'm most afraid of them putting chemicals on everything and examining the carpet and realizing that I actaully suck at my job, that there was still dust everywhere and stuff, and it would all go into the police report. Then after examining my body they'd know that I hadn't brushed my teeth that morning. They'd know who's food I'd been eating off the desks, and that I walk funny and don't follow my own budget and have never been in love. Then they would drop the case, and it would all be in a report that my parents would not be allowed to see. So maybe there is a happy ending.  Now im going to work TWICE a week. See? Now I go on wedsdays to vacuum and again and check the trash. I think thats cool. It'll increase my revenue by about 30%.  Next quarter im taking intro to poetry, piano 101, and soc 101. I'm happy with it. I can't decide if I should get a part-time job though... it would be in retail, and I would kick arse at it, but then there's the question of the precious time I'd loose, the time I'm waiting to do something great with. I'm not sure if working qualifies as great. I'd get money, but since I'd be working how would I enjoy having money? Clearly the better option is to have free time  and  money, so if anyone has figured out how that works tell me asap. Wellfare doesn't count.  Lately I've wished this blog wasn't so public, so I could talk about really interesting things. It used to have that compacity. I look at blogs like  Christmas in July  and swoon with envy. As is now though, I get almost 1000 hits a month... most of which I don't know.   words fail  oblivious to the mirrors she's got for every angle you counter it with the sense of confidence you've bottled but when it all comes down when it all pans out there ain't nothing to be found through her there ain't nothing but the chance I missed the chance I can't repeat every song I sing that I can't complete there are somethings to be said, that are never I confess I confess I've been remiss I've been  too depressed to make myself this obvious cause when its all layed down when it all pans out the me you see for me is only face deep so words fail they've been tossed around sunk like empty freighters run aground and chained to every future remembrance
