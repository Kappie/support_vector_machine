I'M GOING OUT IN PUBLIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I'm the happiest person in the world, I do believe.  Ok, so it's just to a restaurant that I've gone to, like almost every day of my life, but you know, public is public.  La, la, la, la, la, la, sing a happy song!  I have on make-up and I feel slightly human again!  I'm sooooooooooo happy!!!  La, la, la, la, la!
