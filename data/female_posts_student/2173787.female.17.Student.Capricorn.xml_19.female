I went through the same rituals I did when I was 12 and 13, shower hair make up etc.  I put on my favorite dress (also from when I was 13) and arranged my hair and did my makeup.  Same shoes, same purse, it was essentially the same as when I was 13. But when I went to walk out the door I caught a glimpse of my reflection in the clock and realized nothing was the same.  Where a portly girl once stood, now in her place was someone I barely recognized.  When did I grow up? It just happened.  Its funny thinking back to the days when I regularly went to Bar and Bat Mitzvahs.  I would primp for hours and when I was done would swear that it was the best I would ever look.  I thought I was gorgeous, yet when I look at the pictures now I can almost laugh at myself, gawky and done up.  I can;t help but wonder if when I look back on myself as I stand now if the same thing will happen.  I hope not because right now I'm just getting used to my reflection.
