FYI kentesheia's birthday is coming up! This saturday! She's turning  TWENTY THREE .  that's awful close to TWENTY FOUR! which is almost twenty five...  WHICH IS THIRTY!   uh huh. this is for the "meat" joke.   speaking of meat... :) i'm thinking about becoming a vegetarian.  stop laughing.  it's something i've always considered, and the past few months i have been feeling even more strongly about it... i think i'm going to read more about it, and work on changing my diet to incorporate less meat, what little of it there is already. the only meat i ever eat is chicken breast or chicken lunch meat and  you know what, i think i could live without it. (this excludes microwave meals that have red meat in them.. which let me tell you, i can definitely live without those.) any vegetarians out there who want to give me support? :)  take care of yourself kids... i've procrastinated long enough, back to the studying. love, hedish (i like i how i feel this is a letter. dear diary...)
