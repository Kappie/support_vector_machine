The popular of the popular chicks were there. They liked my shirt. OOOOOOO. I feel special that I was acknowledged as a person. Wow, I haven't been that cynical and close-minded for a while.  oh yea. talked to geoff. conversation as follows: Ravelle on her Phone: "Well she's right here, do you wanna talk to her?" Me: "Hello?" Geoff: "Hi, I got your message and um Frank Zappa, and that song were not important." Me: "Yes it was, we listened to it all the time." Geoff: "No we didn't." Me: "Yes we did." Geoff: "No, we didn't." Me: *sigh*"Fine, sorry." Geoff: " One more thing?" Me: "Yea?" Geoff: "Fuck off."  .click.  makes a girl feel real good about herself.
