Well, a while ago her family decided to get rid of their landline and switched to having only cell phones. So from previous experience, I know the number in the phone book is “out of order.” She gave me her new numbers but, idiot that I am, I lost them. So I looked up Ashley’s phone number (it’s crazy, I have absolutely none of my friend’s phone numbers written down) but it’s not in any phone book. So I look up Roxie’s number and call her. Answering machine. She never picks up because she has caller ID and my number doesn’t show up, so she thinks it’s a telemarketer. I hate leaving messages, so I don’t. And I call Jayne. She doesn’t have Chelsea’s, but she has Ash’s. So I call the number she gives me – and I get an answering machine that says this is the home of the “Bobs” or something like that. I didn’t catch it, but I was pretty sure it wasn’t “Bernard” he said. So I call Alysia. Doesn’t have Chelsea’s number, but has Ashley’s. Guess what, it’s the same one Jayne gave me! So I call the number back, and it’s busy. I call about four more times until she picks up and gives me Chelsea’s number…  And nobody answers.  I hate phones.  But today’s experience inspired me to look up/find every single one of my friend’s numbers and print them out to hang on my bulletin board. Everyone’s but Dorene’s, Amy’s and Molly’s, because I probably will never need to call them and besides, Amy is staying in Seattle all summer.  Sorry to bore you with this inconsistent crap…but, if you haven’t noticed, my life is made out of inconsistent crap. I wish I was wittier and could make the whole thing a big joke, but I’m afraid it already is (?). My mother forgot to call Aunt Tonia so if we do go to Ashland, it won’t be for another few days. Too bad…I need my tri-monthly dose of Crazy Marilyn. Heh.
