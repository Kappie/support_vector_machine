Anyways, I did the usual 15 minute stretch, 30 minutes running on the treadmill, then 30 minutes resistance training.  I hate going to the gym later in the day because it is always so crowded.  When I was done with my workout, I went into the locker room to get my stuff, and there was this voracious, flabby Mexican woman just walking around naked.  That's right, no clothes.  Does that seem strange to anyone?  I mean, I've seen this kind of thing before in the locker room, and I guess it might be normal at a gym, but it was still  disturbing.  It's not like she had anything to show off.  So she walks completely naked across the locker room to go weigh herself (as if she is going to be that much lighter without her clothes on).  She says, "Hmm," which caused me to almost burst into laughter--I don't know why, you just had to be there.  Then she jumps in the shower and rinses off.  I bet you're thinking--How does Megan know these intricate details about every move she made?  Well, partly because she failed to close the shower curtain.  And it's not like I was staring--she was pretty hard to miss.  Here's probably the most disgusting part:  She gets out of the shower, doesn't dry off, and walks back toweless to her locker.  She sits down wet and naked on the bench.  OMG!  How gross is that?  Never again will I put my water bottle and music thingy on the bench while I'm situating my locker.  Some people even put the towels that they wipe their faces with on this bench while they are grabbing a drink of water.  I am completely grossed out.  COMPLETELY.
