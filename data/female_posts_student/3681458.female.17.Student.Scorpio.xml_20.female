(First I have to say, that this is entirely unoriginal.  This has to be something out of a book.  There's no way he could have thought of it, nor his friends. And, now that I look at it, I have to laugh.  I am laughing at him right now...)  My sister and Alex found this yesterday.  Emi brought it home and showed Dad, who asked me for Ben's number.  I begged him not to call him, but he called him and threatened him.  It was all my friends and I could do to blow that off rather than seeking revenge.  Like slashing tires, rolling, egging, putting chemicals in his car so it would blow up.  Man, we had some awesome plans.  But anywho back to my story. So, we thought that was all of the signs, but Bernard the security guy at the mall came into the Chocolate Factory today.  He showed my manager the sign and talked to me.  He asked who it was, and for the number.  Which I more than gladly gave him both.  They called him, and apparently scared him so much that he came up to the mall.  Bernard is nice, and it's good to know that he's on my side.  We could have kicked some major ass.  My manager was fucking pissed at Ben because the store's name was on it, and because it was about me.  So, later this afternoon Ben shows up at my house WITH HIS MOM!  I'm sorry, but this is fucking funny.  I laughed my ass off when I found out.  If only I could have seen it.  Don't know what I would have done.  I hate him.  I don't ever wnat to lay eyes on him again.  As Bernard said, if I wasn't already over him, then I am now.  That's the truth.  Hahaha.   Rhia asked how long I was with him, and so did Bernard.  Only seven months. They were both like, "dang." Can't believe he would do all this over seven months...  Dad knows all the charges we could have pressed.  Like Stalking, Slandering (the store's name) and a few others.  Can't remember all that cop stuff.  Eh, but he could be in jail right now.  I'm sure Dad would be sure and talk to the judge and his ass would be in jail for at least 5 years.  But I am not the heartless bitch he says I am, and couldn't bring myself to press charges.   Might get revenge one day, but certainly not now.    And on a side note.  Can't help but think his friends are fucking immature, dramatic idiots.  They could all run around slandering everyone even if it's none of their business, only because they don't have their own lives to worry about.  Good God, they're stupid.  Don't know why I was with him. What a waste of time.    But I have the last laugh.  Wish somebody would have photographed him saying he was sorry.  lol.
