I tried calling 104.9 to get tickets to something. I don't care what, I just want the tickets. Apparently when I dial 877-244-1049 I needn't dial 1 first. Dumb area code crap things. I shall get it next time! I have started reading Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. I'm on chapter 5. The chapters are really short.
