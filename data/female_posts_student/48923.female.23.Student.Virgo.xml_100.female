(yes, i was a clumsy kid who grew up into an adult that has perfected the art of running into walls and twisting my ankles.)  although the pain associated with receiving the scrapes isn't a good thing, the fresh crop of scabs was.  scabs were one of those things i likened to opening presents (releasing my hair from sponge curlers being another) because it was always a surprise to see what exactly hid behind the wrapping.  essentially, i loved to pick my scabs to see what would happen.   would there be a creamy white dot of new skin like a lump of ice cream in a frozen malt lurking beneath the scab?  or would there be a pattern of blood rushing out to produce another scab?  or would there be a bit of both?   i still pick my scabs, but they're usually not as deliciously large as the ones who rented out skin real estate on my knees.  (and i'd still like an explanation why seeing my blood = not icky, but cutting up dead things for the sake of science = extremely icky.)    except...  i've been monitoring a scab on my elbow, due to an unfortunate trip down a water slide.   it was a beautiful scab of grade school proportions, and i've slightly picked at it but didn't rip it off.  (f. yelled at me for even contemplating such a thing.)  of course i've been dying to see what was underneath.    well, the scab decided to fall off on its own.  damn scab.   i've slightly contemplated sending a search mission to find it, just so i can enjoy the pretty patterns of inside of the scab.   of course, not knowing when it decided to go free makes the quest for the scab a bit more difficult because it could be anywhere.  damn it for getting away.
