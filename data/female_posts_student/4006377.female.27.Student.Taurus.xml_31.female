Throw a sock on top and the monster will have eaten it by day's end. Such an insatiable appetite! THAT'S where all the socks really go! So much for actual pairs of socks. I'm happy if they are the same color.  It didn't take me nearly as long today because 70% of my clothes are being boxed up to be taken to St. Vincent DePaul's. I don't like wearing any of my old clothes since they just hang on me. Too many 3xâ€™s and stretched out tops and big-ass jeans. I vow never to return to them. EVER. Goodbye 54.5 pounds! I will NEVER miss you!
