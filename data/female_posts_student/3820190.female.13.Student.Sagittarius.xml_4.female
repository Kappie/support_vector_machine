I saw the same director my Primary school had when our school was having our 50th Golden Anniversary!! It brings back bad memories when I saw him because he was so strict with the actors of the Musical that one of the actors cried when he went home!! I don't want to talk about him any more!!    Talk about today.. There's this Concert held by the Concert Band for Raising fund.. It was   superb  !! Good thing the items they had were different from last week's if not I would have fallen asleep!! Haiz.. The CrossCountry is approaching at the end of this month.. If Miss Poon called my register number just now, I would have been pardoned from the run!! If my friends that are chosen are pardoned from the run, I will push the blame to them if any thing bad were to happen to me!! Hehez.. Nah!! Just joking!!  I'm going to do my homework now..   Sayonara!!
