"balik ka sa monday!"     to think that i came all the way from ateneo(tas pumunta akong ust).. oh man.. that's harsh.. it wouldn't be a bad thing if something productive happened.. but no.. good thing God's there.. i got back  to ateneo safe..(but still feeling super groggy)..    i sure hope i'd enjoy the general assembly later this evening.. pambawi sa masamang umpisa ng araw ko.. anyway.. THANKS TO GOD FOR TAKING CARE OF ME(and thanks to my friend who accompanied me... and who's as pissed off as I am..) oh well..    ei karla.. sorry about the hassle.. i'l make it up to you... mwah!
