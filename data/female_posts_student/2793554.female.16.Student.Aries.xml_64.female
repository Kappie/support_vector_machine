Last night i was hanging out with dylan (who i love so very very much....*swoooooooooooon*) and he was gping to spend the night at my house but he couldnt cause his mom sucks. So i went home, and then melissa and devon called (devon was having a party cause her mom is out of town...devon is my childhood friend and she rocks my socks!!!! shes a cool girl.) and so i brought melissa. whenwe got here it was just people sitting around and there were only like 6 people here, so we all went to the store and bought robotussin gelcaps. OH GOD. Its like dxm only less? i took a whole bunch, and i tripped so much! and melissa was just beingall cool... and it was her first time tripping anything so she had fun i guess. This morning i told her to sleep and she did but her eyes are still HUGE.   I went to the clinic yesterday and they checked out my tummy.. but oh god. This lady put me on a cold metal table with these papery tablecloth things and stuck this huge metal thing in me! and if that wasnt bad enough, she pushed it together and it SPREAD! and so here i am, naked from the waist down, having some 40 year old woman i just met prod me with cold metal objects and q tips. and then she puts this jelly  stuff on her hand and STICKS IT INSIDE ME (ack! my poor vagina!) and pokes around at my organs. eep! it was terrifying. But apparently im clinically okay.  today my tummy really hurts tho. i woke up from what i thought was a parallel dimension curled into a fetal position cause my stomach hurt so bad. maybe i burned a hole in my stomach last night. Which would suck. Id be like a skeleton trying to eat... i would be freakishly skinny and all the food i ate would go straight through me like a cheese grater. Except for those icky unwanted chunks that get stuck in between.  i just read that. I make no sense. im tryingreally hard to type and i dont even know what im talking about. im going to go rummage in devons fridge for food.  And i miss dylan. I LOVE YOU DYLAN! ive only seen him like once for like an hour in the whole week. Maybe ill call him today and we can go hot tubbing :)  ~abby~
