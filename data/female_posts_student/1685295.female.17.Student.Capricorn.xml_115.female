Regrets are a bitch, especially when you don't get play from them ." -evasivecolin  This is something entirely unrelated that an old friend/acquaintance of mine posted.  It made me smile - and seemed oddly appropriate in my life, so here it is.  Thought it should get more publication, and public notice . . .so now a good five of us will see it, no? ^_^  I'm tired.  I started work today - it went, as things often do, better than feared and more mundane than hoped for.  Would you like to donate a dollar to the Save the Children fund?  "Two-dollah"  What?!  Tomorrow? "What children are we saving?"  Um, ma'am, I really don't know. "Did you know only 15% of that goes to the children?"  No sir, really?  Do you want to donate a dollar to the Save the Children overhead?
