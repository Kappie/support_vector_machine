It was amazing to say the least, it's non-linear gameplay and nicley developed RPG system was raved about by everyone whom played it. Here is a description of The Elder Scrolls: Arena by the people whom made it,      Arena started, as the name might suggest, as a medieval-style gladiator game. You had a team of fighters and went around the world fighting other teams in each city's arena until you became grand champion in the Imperial City. The world used for Arena was Tamriel, the fantasy world created by a few members of the staff for use in their weekly DD campaign. During development of Arena, more and more RPG elements were added -- what if you could walk around these cities? What if you could take your team into a dungeon? And soon it was clear what Arena needed to be -- a full-blown RPG.  Inspired by such games as Ultima Underworld and the unheralded Legends of Valour, Arena was now seen as a massive first-person RPG -- the game that recreated the pen-and-paper RPG experience -- be who you want and do what you want. For a long time Arena was a party-based game, where you lead a group of adventurers. This style of play proved less fun in first person, so Arena became a single character game.   Arena was to be the first chapter in an ongoing series of games, so the series took its name from Tamriel's mystical tomes of knowledge that told of its past, present, and future -- The Elder Scrolls.   Now why am I talking about a 10 year old game? The answer is simple, the people over at  urlLink Bethesda  have re-released The Elder Scrolls: Arena. Not for sale mind you, but for free. You can download it at their Elder Scrolls  urlLink website . I suggest you do, because I already did and I love it.
