This book is very entertaining because of the way Erik Larson describes situations.  He embeds real citations within storytelling, but the storytelling is true.  When reading this, one must keep it mind that this is all truth, and no fiction.  The book tells the tale of how the 1893 Chicago World's Fair (Columbian Exposition) was built, focusing on its head architect Daniel Burnham.  The book also focuses on the nation's first serial killer, Dr. H. H. Holmes, who used the fair as a tool to lure victims to him.  Throughout the book, you learn a lot of trivia about America, its innovations, and its people.  It is very interesting, and Larson peaks your interest by building up "suspense" with description, making the reader guess as to what is being described.  Now that sounds confusing, but it actually makes sense.  For instance, the author constantly mentions a young engineer trying to come up with an invention of some sort to top Eiffel's Tower from Paris' Exposition.  Later you find that he wants to create a wheel ride until you find out that his name is Ferris and the author is describing the Ferris Wheel.    There is also a lot of, how can one put it, horror?  Like when you watch a horror movie, and you know it's going to bother you how sick the killer is.  It was like that.  What tops off how twisted America's first serial killer was, is that everything really happened and that it all happened right here in America.  It's one thing to hear in the news about a serial killer, it's another to get inside their mind and find out exactly what they've done.  These parts, I must say, are a little more enjoyable than the fair parts, only because it is new and interesting to find out about such a man, as Dr. H. H. Holmes, scary as he was.  The only downside to this book, in my opinion, is that sometimes the information about the fair can be a little boring.  I would much rather have heard about the people rather than what plants and flowers were to be planted at the fair.  These kinds of descriptions can last a few pages, but the rest of the book makes up for it, in my opinion.
