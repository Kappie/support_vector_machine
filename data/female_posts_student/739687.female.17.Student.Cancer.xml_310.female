I'm just so skeptical, and it's really quite sad.  But I'm happy! Things are wonderful. Fantastic. Amazing. Optimistic.  The list just goes on.  I'm just have this fear of falling. Metaphorically, of course, but you understand.  Because when you fall you get hurt. And you feel pain. And you're left with the scar- the memory- of your defeat.  I don't want that.  I want things to work out.  I want life to be the way that I  want.   Got paid today. That's always good.  To update my hours: Tomorrow (Wednesday) and Thursday I work 4:30-10. Quite an improvement from 4-10. Right.  Friday I work 4:30-12. Please shoot me.  Saturday I have off!!!   And so on.  Well, I need to go finish my homework.  Have faith in a positive outcome, crazies.
