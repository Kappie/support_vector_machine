Well if she writes about me why cant i write about her? Lets see: shes always yelling at me for no reason, when i try to do something nice she tells me not to do it,and she treats me like crap comepare to other people.YES, it does hurt me inside and she may or not know it, but it does.Cant she think about my postition for one time? I mean, right now i can be with my best friend playing for crying out loud, having the best time of my life. =( I did shed some tears today and i probobly will shed more, but why should i? she doesnt care anyway...
