Name change (It will still be the bleached chameleons but with a twist)   N(g).I(mrie).B(abbit). = NIB or it could be BIN or NIB or BNI (but who cares really.), but i intend to make it so it would be like Naughty Ignorant Bitches. or something. you get what i mean. I can't think of anything right now.   Nagbim (NG, IM and BA shuffled) or we could reshuffle it. anything as long as its readable. Hilary you could do the work here you english genius you. anyway.   So it would either be NIB, BIN, NIB, BNI or Nagbim or whatever and after that we'll put aka Le Blanchi Caméléons. (hey, shut up its cool.)   reason why we will use french: parce que, nous reuni dans Canada et apprenez Francais even though we don't really want to. (BEcause we met in canada and learn french even though we dont really want to) which doesnt make much sense really, but still, french is cool.    New name:  NIB aka Le Blanchi Caméléons   or we could just be known as L.B.C though it kind of sounds like a news channel but thats okay i guess. so yes, OPINIONS PLEASE!! i just think The Bleached Chameleons sounds a little bland.  note to self: le nom does not matter. (but i just wanted to speak my mind :()  2. 2004-2005 year plan    at least 5 self composed songs (with all parts written out of course)  hopefully all well rehearsed  5 cover songs well rehearsed (we will each pick one, and the other two will jointly agree on)   record a demo before the summer starts (5 cover songs, 5 original)  coffeehouse!! (its time for the school to suffer, no just joking)   and if possible maybe more original songs (dont worry, ill be doing most of the work for writing. colleen, youll have to write your own parts though, i dont know drums too well.)   note: may seem a little far fetched, but its possible as long as we practice hard and ya know, we should actually start doing something? it doesnt have to be fantastic but it will be intersting. we can sell each demo for like 10 bucks or something. or if we are really that bad, maybe 5. I have lots of ideas pour le album. he he he..   3. Long term plan  Lets just wait till we settle next year yea? hehe though it would be cool to like go platinum or something.   Sorry, I'm kind of dreaming here.   okay, COMMENTS PLEASE, PEOPLE!! (we shall have to add colleen to this soon)
