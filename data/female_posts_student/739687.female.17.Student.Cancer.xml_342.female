No, I'm not going to give them up. So my crying occured yesterday evening, this morning and this afternoon. It is done though. Sometimes stress just gets to me. I don't like to cry, but when I do, it's usually just a way of getting everything over and done with. But hey, at least it was more related to my future and stuff like that. I don't really cry over things. 99.99999999% of the times I cry, it's because I'm arguing with my parents, and I tend to get emotional, because well...when I argue with my dad, he acts like an asshole. Not a grown man asshole, but a childish narrow-minded asshole. He can say alot of things that I don't think a parent should ever say. I can really get torn apart by things he says. I just feel that sometimes he really doesn't care about anyone but himself. There are safe things parents can say when they argue...but when they completely degrade you...not only does it lack maturity...but to have a parent say those things...it kills you. And I have been frustrated with the way the rest of my family talks behind my back, and sort of exludes me from them. Last night my brother and I were sitting up at the dining room table doing homework and stuff...and then my parents were watching tv and they asked my brother to come and watch it with them. They didn't say a word to me. They didn't even acknowledge that I existed. And it was intentional, and I knew that...and I was just kinda sitting there with tears running down my face, and they just kept ignoring me. It can make a person feel dead. I know that sounds touchy and stupid, but the entire situation was just awful. There was mucho arguing last night...and this morning...and this afternoon, after "school". Obviously I didn't go to school. I went over to Bo's house instead. But yeah, I've been gay, emotional Shauna over the past two days. I'm such a lose. Ah well, at least I don't get emotional over teen drama shit, right?  So life is still good...as long as I get my grades rescued. I have faith in myself. I can DO IT. If I try really really really really really really really really really hard. *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* So anyways...I got ice cream today and life is good. Adios crazies.
