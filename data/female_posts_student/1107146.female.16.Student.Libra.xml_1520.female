I've survived being set on fire (several times, woot!), jumping off the roof of my house...altho my heel still hurts a lot to walk on, so I'm going to have to go get it checked...and then I've survived kickboxing on a half-springless trampoline and dangerous stunts in a swimming pool, the least of which involved me messing up a flying squirrel dive                  really                        bad and landing on my back...PAIN. And then being kicked off the diving board, being tackled by two people in midflight, dodging a high-velocity pool basketball, and THEN...cutting some people off, trying to calm down a really angry and large guy after he thought one of us was giving him the bird, and then racing on Concord Road. I won. Of course I won. And then we pulled up next to a cop car and played the Rage Against The Machine song  F*#@ the Police  which was  INCREDIBLY  funny, even more funny when the cop started laughing and gave Brooks (the one who was playing it) the bird and stuff. Some of that was yesterday.  And if I'm not mistaken, it's almost the end of the month...whereafter my cousin is having his birthday come about, whereafter he will be getting his digital camera, WHEREAFTER...  Many of these stunts...  Shall be repeated...like the "rocket in the pocket" one which I am still worshipped for by the ones who saw it, and many other, NEW ones, and skits, and live performances. With music from  STRANGLEBOX  (buy our stuff!), Homegrown, cKy, and MORE! It's going to be incredible.   But die? I don't die.  And if I do, o well, at least I died grinnin'. And that's the ultimate plus right there.
