I love school holidays because u get a break from everything and everyone but i hate them aswell. A lot of the time i spend too much time thinking, picking every aspect of me and my life to pieces. I hate that i know my faults and others see them easily no matter how hard i try to hide them, but yet i am still unable to change in a gd way Whenever i think i have changed in a gd way, another person hates me or openly admits to gd friends of mine what they think of me. I hate this cruel, cruel world. I hate how so many ppl r so cruel but the worst part is i know i am cruel just like them. Im searching for answers to complicated question that i hope will lead me to happiness, but instead the searching causes hurt to others and myself.        Another thing, love is overrated. I hate it... its meant to beautiful but thats bullshit. How can it be beautiful if u hide it from ppl, how can it be beautiful if someone says they love u and then later hate u or even hit u. Its not beautiful and like everything else it not perfect. And by saying this im sure u can tell that i want to love and be loved...        Neways thats just a piece, a small fraction of my state of mind atm.
