Of course, I had to convince Brian to rent it -- that was a total struggle. His reluctance was the main reason we didn't get to see it in theaters when it first came out. Got to see it on DVD eventually -- we ARE movie buffs after all. Brian admitted that he enjoyed it also afterwards. I had to tease him for giving me such a difficult time.    I think I liked  Original Sin  more than you did, Daf. I'm a big Angelina Jolie fan! And not just of her boobs. That's probably the difference. You got to see a lot of Antonio Banderas' ass in that movie! They got very, very naked.. I was totally surprised!    Our most recent rental was  The House of Mirth , based on the Edith Wharton novel. I had to talk Brian really hard into renting that one. He hates period pieces. He only likes them if there's blood and gore. His favorite period pieces?  Braveheart  (which is everyone's favorite),  The Patriot ,  Gladiator , and the like.. I think the only exception would be  The Restoration  which does not have blood and gore (unless you consider the plague factor). It's one of my favorite movies and I forced him to watch it. He protested quite a bit, but Robert Downey Jr.'s incredible acting ability made him change his mind.
