I'm going to miss so many people :(  I really really do dislike school sometimes. I hate the favouritism. sometimes i just feel like noone really cares about what i do... its like there is the "select" few that are more "important" but then... i guess we dont appreciate the 'safety' of school, and it isnt all that bad. i mean we go, we muck around (and then spend our time working our arses off doing work >:(...)and there is stuff like dukes which i absolutely LOVE!! I'll miss that heaps.  dukes was so good! except for some of the year 9s... hmmm yeah and my freaking shoulder. i forgot how much i love it and now its over :(  simple plan is the story of my life  ----------------------- I don't wanna make this  Harder than I have to  This is how it has to be  There's so many things I want to say  But you just don't listen to me   Everything I say  You find a way to make it  Sound like I was born just yesterday  Everything you taught me  Doesn't mean alot So I'm going my way   =======================  Sometimes this house feels like a prison That I just can't leave behind There's so many rules  I gotta follow Cuz you can't let go  I don't wanna hear it And I just can't believe it All the stupid things you say, but  One day I won't take this anymore One day I'll be old enough To do what I want to And I won't have to run away And you won't be there to say I'm not allowed to One day  Sometimes I wonder if you know me Or if you just pretend to care So tell me are you  On a mission to bring me down?  I did not write those lyrics, but simple plan rock my socks
