We should get to choose what we want to wear, not the school board, not are parents, and no one else! we could have responsibilities  of what to we can wear, and we should follow a dress code at school or at home, and anywhere else, but we should never have to dress all the same, and if they want us to wear uniforms, they should give us a style and let us have the choice of color, we should ahve the choice to have our shirts tucked or untucked. its only fair!
