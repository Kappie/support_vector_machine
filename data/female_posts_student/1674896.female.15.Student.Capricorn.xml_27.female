I say you don't show  Don't move, time is slow  I say... take me out!   If I move this could die If I move this could die I want you...to take me out!  I say you don't know  You say you don't go  I say... take me out!   I know I won't be leaving here (with you)  I know I won't be leaving here  I know I won't be leaving here (with you)  I know I won't be leaving here with you  I say don't you know? You say you don't know I say take me out  If I wink, this can die If I wane, this can die I want you to take me out  If I move, this could die If I move, this could die Come on, take me out  I know I won't be leaving here I know I won't be leaving here I know I won't be leaving here I know I won't be leaving here with you     i absolutly adore that song. its so peppy. guess what i did on friday. i colored my hair. all by myself too! its really red. i wasnt exactly expecting it, but hey, its a nice change. cheer practice starts tomorrow. im really excited. i need to get away from my mom. 2 1/2 hrs isnt really that long to not have her breathing down my neck but at least i have it. i told her that she needed to let me grow up cause im not 12 anymore, and first she freaked out and yelled, then she started crying. she blamed it on pms but i dont believe her. i mean i love her, but i think shes crazy. i really miss school. i cant wait till it starts back next year. i hate christian. hes so mean. sometimes he'll just randomly IM me and say, well since im a nice little girl im not gonna repeat it. but if youre smart you'll prolly figure it out. LOOK IM TALKING ABOUT YOU CHRISTIAN. the world will end. im bored. i want viva la bam to come on. thats the best show ever. ok bye
