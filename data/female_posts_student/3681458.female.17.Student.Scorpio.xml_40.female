We have had five preseason games. My saturday was spent in smyrna at a "playday" (the team calls it a tourny..) and we did okay. We had four games. My scalp got sunburnt really bad. I hate that feeling, because then I can't brush it.  School is going well. Calculus is actually turning out fun. That sounds weird, but I really enjoy math.  I am trying to be nicer to Nathan after two weeks of relentless bashing by me and the guys...  Alex and I are getting closer. He asked me if I wanted to go to prom with him again this year. I don't really know what to say to that. It's like this: I do and I don't want to go with him. He can't dance which is a major downfall, and I can't see why he's thinking about it this early with me. Who knows. At the same time I don't want to really let him down. He's been shot down by alot of girls. I am just his friend, and I'm sure we would have a blast like we did last year. He is just hard to read. That is hard for me, because I know pretty much everything about him, and I can read him easily...  I am getting reprimanded for all these girly things that I listen to/watch now. Eh. Like Dirty Dancing Havana Nights. -This was a good movie, or so I thought... but my guy friends reprimand me for watching stuff like this. I get frustrated for not getting to be the girl in the group of guys. OH well. Sad to say, but I really liked the afro-cuban music in this movie. ON top of that... I really liked that actor. Gosh, he was cute.  but this is all for now. i'm gonna go chillax. Peace out
