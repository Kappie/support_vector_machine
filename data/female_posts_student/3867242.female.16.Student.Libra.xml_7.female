I don't have to get them pulled but's it's sad..because I will someday! Then I had to wait in the denist office for like a half hour afterwards because Rachael had to teach swimming lessons..and no one else could get me. Then I when home and ate lunch. Then Rachael and I went to Meadville..and then we headed for the REC for work. 1 hour after I got there we had to close the pool because it's raining really hard. So after Kim (my boss) and I cleaned up..I went home. So Ionly gotpayed for1 hour worth of work today :(The only great thing about my day was I ate chinese for dinner. Now, I'm kind of bored...I filled out this survey (160 questions!) that Mike send me over hotmail. I'm thinking about watching t.v. with the family soon. Tommorrow, I'm possibly going to my Grandma's house and then I have good old driving lessons again. That's all I have..I'm sorry..I'm not in the best mood right now..I wish something exciting would happen and I would be happy. Night and sweet dreams.
