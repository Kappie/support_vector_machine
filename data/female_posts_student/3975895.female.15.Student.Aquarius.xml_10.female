It's all worth it in the end! The Monkeys are sooo kyute! My Coconuts are cute too, but they're not as hyper and active! But that's okay! I absolutely love Stephanie and Janice! They're like my two favorite kids! So kyute, so energetic! I love it! Took lots of pictures with them! I can't wait till Friday!! When Jo and Jasy and Karen are all going to be here!! It'll be soo fun! So many people!! Awesomee!!!
