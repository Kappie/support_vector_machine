"what do you want to do?" conversation that sometimes annoys me... he just said "hmm... i guess i wasn't prepared with anything cool to do, so give me tomorrow to plan, okay?  i'll call you at 7 and we'll go out!"  :)  i liked that.  i like that he's putting effort into our date.  effort- something that i don't often find in men.    i spoke with ben a few nights ago... he called at midnight and asked if i wanted to come over.  you all may not think this is a very big deal, but i told him NO!  that was a huge step for me... i have a definite weakness for ben!!!  we're still friends, and that i like... but calling me over at midnight was "friends" not friends.  and lastly... i spoke with andre'a today.  he's doing well in italy.  when he returns home, he asked if i would accompany him in a nice italian dinner with fresh mozerella cheese, and homemade pasta and wine- brought back from italy!  HOW CAN I TURN THAT DOWN?!
