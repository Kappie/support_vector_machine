Okay, it wasn't named the Fat People Section, it was called the Wide section, same dif right?  I mean, I suppose you COULD be really wide one way, and really skinny the other, like a piece of paper, but is it likely to happen???  No.  Sorry, people.  :0) heheh.  Hmm... How weird.  You can ship underwear to peeps for their birthday.  It's like, "here's a wonderful pink bra for you, you need one."  I would find that insulting.  I mean.... Sorry again.  :0)    Oh, I got a job.  No, not the one at the silk screen place (Donette said she was 'downsizing'), but at Sue's summer camp.  It's like 5 weeks @ $100 a week... That's like.... $500!!!!  Wow!  That's like the most mula I have ever had!  $100 a week to teach kids crafts, go swimming, goof off, and go to copper creek.  wow.  hahaha.  It's like 4 hours a day.  Not bad.  It'll be fun.   So waz up wit yours truly other then all that stuff??  Notin' really.  I'm trying to get done on a picture for my uncle that I've been working on for a long time - like 3 months.  It's never quite right... But then, DiVinci worked on Mona Lisa for like 5 years.  So I guess 3+ months isn't that bad....    Hmm...  Quizzilla just told me that my greek god is Aphrodite.  What is up with this???  Every quiz in the world is tellin me I'm a romantic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  AM I???  NO!!!  Idiot quiz...  Just 'cause I daydream, don't mean I'm a romantic.  Sheesh.  AND I"M ALL ABOUT BEING GIRLY AND PRETTY??????  HUH??????  come on!  And I have a twisted soul.  So I'm a romantic wit a twisted soul.... Okay.... "Twisted Souls have good senses of Humor and other times can be a bore."  haha.  or "Twisted Souls are kind, loving, weird, zany, temperamental, and very talented."  hehe "But, if you love someone, youre serious about it, intense, and forever loyal. Congratulations-the world should have more like you."  Oh yeah.  hahaha.   And I'm not in love.  I knew that.  But I'm also not not in love.  So I'm somewhere in between???  And if I were a pair of shoe's I'd be sandels.  Oh yeah!  Tevas all the way!   And my weird latin phrase is, "Furnulum pani nolo".  Which means... *drum roll*  I don't want a toaster?????  wow.  How weird.  hehe.  (for you who don't know, I have been taking Quizilla quizes.  A lot of fun, but not something to do with your parents looking over your shoulder) hehe  Nothing much else going on. I'm kinda bored, kinda lonely.  I miss everyone at drama.  waaa.  I wish there was another play going on.  Man... I should go to public school next year.  :0)  *sigh*  Signing off - Jack the.... Me
