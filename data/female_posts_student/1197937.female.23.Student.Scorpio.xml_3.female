Fortunately, she was the second car from the front of the line, so the impact wasn't too bad and she came out unscraped.  The accident, which occurred in a matter of a milli-second, took 7 hours in the making.  I woke up at 9 this morning to find that I'd overslept. I was supposed to have woken up two hours earlier to go to the dealership with my mom to get my car maintenanced. Instead, she didn't have the heart to wake me up and went by herself. So i brushed, washed, ate breakfast, watched "i love lucy," clipped my nails, watched "good day LA," checked email, watched "mad about you," changed into my beloved overalls, and watched "the wonder years." by the time "all my children" rolled around, i was getting a little anxious about my mom's return. it had been four hours! where could she be and why hadn't she called?? a deluge of horrible thoughts washed over me. what if she was the only person, woman, sitting in the customer lounge at the dealership, surrounded by smooth-talking car salesmen, aka gigalos in loud hawaiian shirts with fake gold chains dangling heavily from their necks?? what if they slipped her a "mickey?!" yeah, so i guess my overactive imagination kinda took over. before i knew it, i had cleaned my bedroom and study, washed all the dishes in the sink, and laid out an elaborate lunch feast consisting of chicken salad and ham/lettuce rolls on the dining table. cooking and cleaning, in case you didn't know, are neon signs of panic and pandemonium in my life. i'd just about decided to take off for the dealership myself, ready to taebo the life outta some beemer pervs, when my mom came through the door. she explained that it'd taken forever because they had to change my tire, fix my window, give my car an oil change, wash and wax. after All that, she still had to go back, cuz in the process of fixing my window, they'd gotten the lock stuck on my door. immediately, my colossal apprehension morphed into slight annoyance. what a bother, i was hoping to spend the afternoon at the bookstore. "it's okay, I go again," my mom said.   So three hours later, I got the call. It was as if the fear, anxiety, and guilt of the morning had awaken from napping and not only surreptitiously resurfaced, but knocked me over and sat on me like an overweight three-headed monster.  "Sooner or later . . . . what goes around comes around . . . you Feel it, you Know it" you see, i'm a big believer in retribution. premonition as well. of all things, my instinct is something i trust. in this case, my selfishness simply overruled my sixth sense. If I'd gone instead of my mom, in the morning, none of this woulda happened. If i'd gone instead of my mom, in the afternoon, it woulda been me in the car accident instead of her.  I'll be the first to admit, i'm a self-centered person. I don't try to lay the blame on my being the only child. It's my nature, that's all. My parents are at the bullseye of my selfishness, unfortunate lambs privvy to my irish-like temper and rainbow-colored moods. As if that's not enough, I demand that they be with me forever. I mean, I will never let them go. It would surely drive me mad.
