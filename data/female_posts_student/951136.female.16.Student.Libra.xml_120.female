And i mean, sure i may do things that ppl would think like that, but what the hell, i'm not. and another thing. at the party last night...woah...what the hell was that. on one of the fast songs jessica in all her sexy glory was dancing ( you know what i mean i'm sure) and shashank comes up behind her, grabs her hips and starts grinding...i mean like, ummm shashank, you ok there? and me and ekta just look at eachother like, did we miss something? and i was carrying jessica b.c. she wouldn't get up adn she was starting to slip so shashank takes her up, and carries her off i was like...?ok..? and ekta, jessica, and jennifer and i were sitting around the table and shashank comes up and is leaning on jessica's chair quite possesively, if i may say so. it was just curious. oh ya- and janelle and lucas were off in a dark corner talking for my 35 minutes- about, i know not...Ekta and i were sitting there during on of the slow songs and we were like, no one has ever asked us to dance for a slow song. and then ken asked her to dance. it was kinda funny. i think he did it to make her feel better, but she felt really awkward, and they stopped after a few seconds. the dancing part was fun, alot of the other stuff was annoying. strawberries were amazing. we had to literally drag jessica way from the indian food. Thomas Dean is  cute ...but hes all about Amy Zak.sigh. so, NMF will keep me busy all week. argh. I really want to go see Saved! then Solo contest in Austin, then SAT, then Summer School, then to Massachusettes, THEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I THINK I MIGHT ACTUALLY GET TO GO TO LAFAYETTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!  i cant even think about it or i'll get my hopes up :) ok i have to go. boi.
