At least... I don't tell anyone when I do.  I don't really like knowing I'm doing what "everyone else is doing."  I never read Left behind or Harry potter.. I'm sure they're great but I have never liked the "millions of readers agree" type of thing.  My music is the same.  I know every band has hundreds of fans... But do you really need a copy of a CD you've never even listened to?  Maybe it's selfish.  But these things, poetry, music, books... Are so self expressive.  You can learn so much about a person through them.  I hate having that just thrown around.  I hate feeling like my identity is being turned into a free for all.  This isn't going where i had planned.  Let me start over.  I don't really write poetry anymore.  This is a year old.
