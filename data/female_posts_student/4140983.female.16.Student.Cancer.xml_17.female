I'm still working on the thousand books I bought in Vegas. But now I'm listening to the soundtrack. It's great, although obscenely nasal.  I hate Arkansas, there are so many books banned. Especially at Hasting's, since it's run by a Christian guy. But...yeah...there was one copy of 1984, which I haven't seen anywhere in Arkansas, I think, and it was so tempting, but I couldn't have afforded anything else. Anyway, Digital Fortress looks AWESOME, and I trust Lauren's judgement.  We went to dinner, and I ordered fried rice, and I almost died. There was enough for about six people. So I, being the fatass I am, ate like half and saved the rest for both lunch and dinner tomorrow. Ahhh, and there's cake in the microwave. Oh, yeah, apparently people think it's funny to call anorexic people fat, so I want to go up to like Monica one day and go, "Why don't you ever eat, you anorexic bitch?"  I want to paint my nails, but I'm working Sunday. It's OK to have light polish, I'm sure, but I was either going to paint them hot pink, or sharpie over what I've got now. Maybe hot pink with polka dots or stripes. But we aren't allowed to have polish at work. I'm going in from 8-3, so it'll be my first breakfast run. Sunday afternoons are slow, though. Fun! I can't work tomorrow, my contact appointment is at 11:15 tomorrow, and I'm going shopping before and after.  Ahh, this song is so addictive.
