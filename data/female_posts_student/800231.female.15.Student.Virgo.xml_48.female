I didn't know that Clara was also there,so anyway she decided to entertain the long line behind us by yelling, "Damn Angela! Can't you hurry?! You're such a little whore! Angela you fucking slut! I bet you'd fuck anyone in here!" I turned around slowly thinking I was about to be killed by someone only to see everyone in the room staring at Clara. Finally one guy I didn't even know said, "What the fuck is your problem?" Clara just grinned like a fool and said "It's OK. We're buddies! I can call her anything I like! HAH! You can't!" and she ran out of the room. The guy just gave me this totally pitying look. Good lord. She was joking though, she apologized later and did my math homework so all was fine.  Our lunch group is growing, frighteningly enough. It used to just be Alice, Lucia, Helen and I that would lurk about the music corridor at lunch. Apparently our other friends have decided to merge because lately it's been, Lucia, Alice, Helen, Cece, Steph, Kassie, Mia, Rose, Breanna and I. Helen made the mistake of saying hello to some random friendless outcast named Will a few days ago and now he WON'T GO AWAY! Seriously! Every bloody day, he wanders in and just sits there. Now, I'm always open to new comers but this is weird. He's "Special", really.  Wow, the more I think about it the more it sounds like I've become a bully! Jesus, I never thought I'd see the day. Perhaps I should be nicer to people... or something.  Mr. F officially does not care about Steph and I anymore. Yesterday he gave us permission leave class 40 minutes early and beg for food. We told him we were starving because we were homeless and shared a box on the street... Anyway, he was so disgusted with us he just told us to go away. YAY! Actually, he took it back today. He made me stay 10 minutes after class so that he could stare creepy-like at me. Oddness.
