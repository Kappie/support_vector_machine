I'm not sure if I'm in a funk from the events of this past weekend or if I'm just sick and tired of this shit and looking forward (anxiously) to the next step (law school). I just feel really really low. I think it has something to do with the fact that my weekend was traumatic. But my friend C knows a guy from her job that wants to be set up with me, which is a positive thing. I have really sworn off of dating for a long time, but the good thing about this is that I am leaving here in two months (and counting!) and so I know it cannot turn into anything serious or more than a good time. Unless he's a psychotic bastard, but I hope I don't get to that point with him. We'll see where that all goes. I am just glad to be on the recovery track from this whirlwind of lies and betrayal. Now I can just leave R and V to deal with their own bullshit and deception together, because I'm completely out of the picture. I wonder if they'll work out...hard to say. I really do feel for V, because she thought she was getting back into a worthwhile relationship and believed their drama days were behind them. And she gave him her virginity, too...I don't wish heartbreak of that sort on anyone, even if they are the object of the person I love's desire. I'm starting to doubt how I feel about him anymore, anyway. I don't think I can love him after he deceived me the way he did. I am just so numb to him now, so I'm not sure if I can comment how I truly feel. It just seems like my body and my heart went into shock. After Sunday, I just couldn't cry over this anymore, and my head will not really allow my thoughts to remain there, either. But my body has been extremely and inexplicably lethargic, and it's hard to pinpoint the reason for it. I don't know. I just imagine that the toll taken on me cannot be masked by any defense mechanism, automatic or forced. I just wonder if he's truly sorry and if he'll get over losing me from his life easily or not. I just want to believe that he didn't mean to do this and that he's really sorry, but I don't believe it. I can't. So I guess it does hurt me enough to have a strong reaction...but I won't allow myself to dwell on what happened much...probably healthiest that way. Anyway, I think I'm gonna take a break and read a book. Too much Internet for one day.
