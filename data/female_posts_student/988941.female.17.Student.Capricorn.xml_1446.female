What I would give for spending all that time collecting trollys rather than having abuse shouted at me via the idiotic hoodlums that hang around outside Woolies. Gah. Anyways, Nicki Johnson (Jen's sis) sent me a pic from her leavers ball trhough. Awww, I wish i could do our leavers ball all over again. Lol. It was so much fun. I love limos. When I'm older I shall buy one. And a driver to drive me around all day. Woo! Limo are cool. It was really good that night. I'm sure our sixth form one will be good as well, if not better? But then again, in year 11 you have your friends around you who you have known for years whereas now people like Angela etc.. have gone off somewhere else. Oh :(
