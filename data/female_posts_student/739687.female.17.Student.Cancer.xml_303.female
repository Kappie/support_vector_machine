I have grown to be a very strong person. I have strengthened and matured alot from who I used to be. I may have alot of moments that I'm not too proud of, but lately, I'm proud of every choice I've made and every path I've taken. I have felt that I've been making alot of mature, logical decisions. And it's about time.  And if I truly feel that I'm making the best choices, then it would seem only logical that I should come out ahead. And we'll just see. Because I'm going to do everything in my power to get what I want.  My mind is set. Don't fuck with me.  :-)  I'm unstoppable, crazies.
