But seeing as you are miles away from me,  I guess it will take time.  When I lay in bed and think, I still feel sad and lonely.  I miss your touch and smile,  you're still my one and only.  When you said "I love you",  I shivered from head to toe. I wanted you to hold me, and never let you go.  If I could only have one wish,  I'd wish that you were mine forever. So I could love and care for you,  ........until the end of time.
