I am either working on someone's yard or garden, or Adam is on the computer working on things that I can not understand. So the only time I can post on this site is at midnight. I also talk to Ian on the phone a lot so there isn't much left to post here. I love the South Park drawing Ian did of me, and I am sorry Jackie if me posting on the website is making you angry but Ian made me promise that I would as often as I can spare.
