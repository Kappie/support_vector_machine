Keely, Nick and I were headed down to Canal Park anyway, so I stopped by Hawthorn and talked with two of my bosses and will be picking up a weekend shift every weekend. Shawn will have to babysit Nick while I work on Saturdays/Sundays. Each week it will probably be different. I'm excited and dreading it all at the same time. I absolutely love being home with Nick. He is changing so much daily. Tonight is girls night out! Miranda  I are going to Chi Chi's. Tonight is the 1st time Shawn will be babysitting Nick. Good Luck Shawn! Tomorrow is Shawn's guys night out. I finally got my car back!!! I love it!!!
