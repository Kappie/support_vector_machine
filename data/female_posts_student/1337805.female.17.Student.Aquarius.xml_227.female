Went to a presentation done by the Bahai school. They are so great. It was the same one we saw in grade 8 adn junk, with the pot and junk on the shirts..so great :) I hearted it. And Nick went too, and we sat next to each other and were able to kinda cuddle the whole time. I liked that :)   Rawr! Went to Nick's place again today, had..a lot of fun :P Man, it was fun. Holy crap. :P I can't describe it. I think I....worried, surprised? Nick :P We played a fun game.....the chain game...and...that's fun..but I don't think its a game you play all the time..you only play it..when...someone's been baaad...to keepthe heat and the game more...spicy...RAWR. Anyways.  And its that time of the month, and I've already freaked out and burst into tears twice. In one hour. Here's to hoping it ends SOON. Like, tomorw.  Anyways, I'm hurting again, so I will chat with you all later. G'night.
