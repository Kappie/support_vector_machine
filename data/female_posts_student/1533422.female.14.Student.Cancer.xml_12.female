These townies went past and we were waving at them, and they kept gesturing at us to come outside.  We wouldn't, so they tried to come inside, and were turned away by the bouncer on the door.  They were still hanging around outside though, but then Millsey stands up and looked at them, and they looked at him, and they just ran away.  This bald guy came past, he looked inside, and found these little flowers, and was trying to propose to Claire through the window.  Wonder what Bob would say about that, hey ...   I told Claire who I fancy, but only cuz he's in her year.  I wonder if she thinks he's fit ...  Anyway, we were dicussing her year and I was like, "You've got the best year by far!  There are sooo many fit guys ..." and she was like, "Oh my God, who?! I can't think of anyone!" and I was just thinking, wait a minute, you're going out with Bob but you don't think he's fit??    My sister has this obsession with making balloon things, so there was this pink monster balloon hat, so I put it on, and Jeremery goes, "I wonder what Elliott would say if he saw you like that," and I was like, "Shuttup!!"  Lool, he got a new, really expensive haircut (his family are sooo rich.  While other people would have an extension put on their house, his faimly are having an "extra wing" built) and he hates it.  Okay, that's not actually that funny.  And I'm just rambling now.  Oh my God, this total BITCH going by the name of Becky D. (I shall not put any more here, but I think it's really obvious who I mean if I say she's a Science teacher's daughter) used ma sister's party as a meeting place to meet Ellie and Misty so they could go clubbing in Birmingham.  Katherine had invited them all ages before Becky arranged any night out.  Ellie thought it was a good compromise, going to the party and then going clubbing, but then Becky turns up, doesn't say anything to Katherine, and it seemed really spiteful, just meeting there.  Gawd, what a bitch!   Oh yay, Clare's talking to me.  PISS OFF.  My MSN name is "What do you call a townie with two brain cells? - Pregnant" so she goes, "lmbfao at your name" and I reeeeally wanted to say, "Why?  You're a townie yourself."  I really want to slap her.  GET LOST.  Sorry. I can say in blog what I cannot say to people's faces.  Over MSN.  Whatever.  She's launching into a story about what they did at the cinema last night, and they only went to the blummin' cinema cuz they knew I wouldn't be able to go because of Katherine's party.  Grr.  Not that I would've gone anyway (I would rather snog Horvath than spend quality time with Clare and Charlotte), but still.   I'm going to go now.  My mum keeps giving me suspicious looks and I'm really scared she's going to start reading this.  *~Jools~*
