It amazes me to think where I was a year ago. Certainly not here, that�s for sure.  I feel nowadays that I need to do something, accomplish something, find the meaning to things I don�t (or can�t) understand in my 23 years of age. Through church and my belief in God, I know what the meaning of life is, that is not what worries or troubles me. It is the day to day process, the question of what to do next. Is this making any sense?  I have registered for 12 units at school and will go if I can round up the money for tuition. I think that the 12 units will go nicely with the 48 hour work weeks that I put in at the moment. Somehow I doubt I will go through with all 12 units, but we will see what happens.    urlLink Brenden  is wonderful as usual. Time with him is becoming very important to me. On good weeks I see him on my weekend (Wed  Thu) as well as on his weekend (Sat  Sun). I know he loves me and I believe him when he tells me. But on the same hand I get very frustrated when we go for days at a time without seeing each other. I am at a loss for solutions at the moment. Good things can only get better at this point.  I have to thank  urlLink The Man Chris  yet again for this wonderful computer. It was exactly what I needed, despite the fact he kept telling me �It�s not the fastest computer�. It�s perfect for me and my humble abode.  I am really excited that my best bud  urlLink Clare  will be home in the AV for Christmas. It has been a while since we have had time together. There is a lot of catching up to do. I wanted her to come see �LOTR: Return of the King� with Brenden and I, but it seems that she and her family have made an event of it. I actually don�t know what Brenden and I will end up doing�maybe see it with his UCLA buds or maybe even watch it at Universal City and make a day of it. I am planning on making it a special day, whatever we choose to do.  Now that I have my own computer and insomnia, I can write longer blog entries. I hope that doesn�t disappoint my loyal audience�all 2 of you.  Smile, be well.
