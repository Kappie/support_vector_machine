First it won't open mi blog,then it won't open others blogs, then it won't publish posts, even tho it says they r published, then it won't delete them!! I am so over computers not doing what they r told! Well, long story short I'm back from Canberra!!! I used mi fone like I have never b4!! I had 6 calls and recieved 30 SMS's and sent the same in reply :D All this in 3 days. Mi folks r gonna kill me wen they find out!! Overall the trip, was well, crazy. It was funny, cold, boring, everything! But I'll do a long Canberra blog lata. Moving on, tomorrow. Tomorrow I am going 2 see Shrek 2 with Luke, Joel, Tim McCloud (T1), Nat, Ash Baker, Ash Bennet, Jodie, Gemma, Hannah Wiseman and Bec Baines. That's a lot 'o people. Should be fun.
