The only way to heaven in through Faith in Jesus Christ, he alone can forgive all our sins and make us acceptable to God.   The Holy Spirit lives in every born again Christian and is necessary to be saved, to have eternal life and live a life that is pleasing to God.       God will Always love you no matter what you do, but it doesn't mean you can do bad things and expect to be forgiven.
