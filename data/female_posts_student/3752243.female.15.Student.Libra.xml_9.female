Then we went and walked to ger ice cream and it started to rain, profusley! We were soaked through! It was fun to the max! Taryn went to Target and bought me shoes. They are pretty like, with sparkle do-hickeys and such. I leave on Sunday for the cottage,I am so excited! Mommy is taking me shopping tonight to bye all the esentials. I am going to hunt for the opposite sex while I am there, I have not had a summer fling, and I would like to say I have had one, that would be fun? The Outsiders is on right now,which is one of my favorite movies in the whole world. My friend Kayla and I were obsessed with it. She was going to marry Matt Dillon (grr!)and I was to marry patrick Swazye. (yay)It was a fun phase, that I am not sure I want to be done with. Anyways, I am off like a dirty shirt, oh Duckie, and if I have used that line before I apoligise! Hoccha! Author:Eve
