I know that sounds pretty lame, but it is entirely strange that in the midst of both my friends and pink pants can I still feel void.  I suppose it is one of those things that really doesn't even have to do with people, but just having issues with yourself. I am one of the most indecisive people on the planet, who gave me permission to have friends as cool as you all?? I guess what I am trying to say is that perhpahs I feel guilty for feeling shitty when I am surrounded by great people. I know we have already established the fact that I am a sap, but truly... I don't know where I am going with this, I just needed to vent. Welcome to an online journal, folks, no, it isn't just arguing over what to do every Friday.   I guess that all I need is a little push; a little reassurance... I'm leaving for Tahoe on Tuesday, and I am coming back Friday. Damn, I am missing practically the entire break. God, I don't want to go. *sniff*
