[ Tue Nov 26, 04:16:53 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] A friend of mine just called me to see what his friend could do to ensure he passed a drug test. I find this funny. Sadly due to people who have floated in and out of my life I knew exactly what to tell him... but the thing I told him that was the most important - GO TALK TO THE PEOPLE AT GNC, they know what they are talking about and most of their business comes from people trying to pass drug tests... but the one thing I can guarantee you all, if it's a hair test... there is no getting around it, so don't even try. [ Tue Nov 26, 03:46:35 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] Well so it has been sooo friggin long since I have posted. I don't even know where to begin. I went to NYC two weekends ago and trudged around in the rain for hours on end but I loved it! I miss it so much! I WILL, mark my words, move back there either to go to college or right after college. I need to be there, I feed off of the place. I just finished reading through Caryn's blog. That girl cracks me up! I love her! I had honestly forgotten what a cool person she was until starting up bells with her again this year. Reading through her blog inspired me to take a break from my new job and write whats going on. I missed blogging. I have been so busy though. I kept trying to blog a while back when i first started my new job to let you all know how much I love it but unfortunately I just couldn't seem to get the thing to work... uh oh... one of the state pages is about to cause my whole Internet Explorer to shut down... I'll be back in a minute  [ Tue Nov 26, 03:38:56 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] Hi
