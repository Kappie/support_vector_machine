ARGH ! .. i'm getting mood swings again .. anyway .. i'm so not in the mood to type another long one now already so ii'm just gonna brief through what i wrote .. it's friday the 13th today .. and i really really hope that no shits gonna happen to me .. hey .. i believe in black cats k .. in addition to it i'm gonna watch * the village * tonight somemore .. so it's just gonna make matters worst .. i've been having lots of dreams recently .. adnt their ALL bad ones .. aih .. i think the worst one was about some tribal spirits plucking my toes off .. it's freaky man .. i woke up with my feet feeling so numb and cold .. this whole week has been shitty actually .. me and jace are at each other's throat ALL the time ! .. i dunno la .. i feel like one big bad bitch .. it's like now when she cries .. all i say is ok .. bye .. last time i'd call back to make things right .. i just dun see the point now .. i wanna forget it all .. but the whole things is still stuck in my head .. my mom nearly sent me to some doctor .. she claimed that i look so depressed all the time .. plus she saw the cuts on my hand .. it's healing .. but the scars are dark .. seems that i'm undergoing sign's of chronic depression .. didn't go in the end though .. she had appointment ..  to make matters worse .. jade called me .. apparently jace's mom wants to talk to me too .. probably complaining that i stress her daughter too much or something .. i dunno .. it seems like she has something against me .. probably thinks i'm hurting jace all the time .. it seems unfair .. everytime they see jace cry .. it's as if i'm the main cause of it .. and i dunno la .. jade told me to be more understanding .. give in and dun call her when she's working .. i dun even call her anymore this days .. only that once in a while to ask her some small stuff .. this is really bias .. have they seen ME cry ? .. i dun think so rite .. so how can they just go pushing it all on me telling me to give in ? do they even know the cause of this ? .. even if they do .. they'd probably feel it's no big deal on my side .. and that's seriously bias .. i dunno la .. i am being more stubborn this days i do admit .. but who made me this way ? ..  i hate things now la .. i'm like the bitch to every problems we have now .. i'm so afraid of everything .. being close to her again .. caring for her again .. to the extend of frenching her ! so many thoughts have been wandering around my mind .. the main big question still though is - WHY .. why did she have to do it .. i'm still haunted by the image of jee may telling me the whole thing in sandy park .. i can rememebr how exactly i felt then .. ugh .. that was one of the worst feeling ever .. even worst then guilt .. i'm thinking so much lately that i think i'm graying .. i just plucked two white hair out yesterday .. maybe my kiss sucks so much that she has to find somebody else .. or maybe she was getting bored of me .. or maybe i'm just plain awful to look at .. recently i feel so .. down .. totally no more self esteem .. i'm like some ugly duckling now =  dunno la .. when am i ever gonna get over this incident .. or get over her .. both seems impossible .. our arguments lately are getting more serious .. but over more silly things .. i make one comment .. and then she misunderstands and then we argue .. argh .. tonights friday night .. i bet you will argue about where to go after our movie .. she's sick today la though .. despite how i say i dun care about her .. i still do .. well .. a lil bit la .. she's sick .. and .. dragging her around to smoky and noisy places isn't exactly the best thing for her condition now .. oh .. btw .. ju nn messaged her yesterday .. her face looked paled when it was ju who messaged her .. i'm so so sure that they haven been talking .. maybe not this week .. cause ju said * didin't talk to you for such a long time * .. i think their long time is probably 1 week or something .. anyway .. i realised something .. she told me before not to type any * heheh or hahah * in her messages when she ask me to help her reply .. when i ask why .. she said - oh .. i dun type liddat wan la only to you .. yea yeaaaaaa .. in all her messages with ju nn .. there's definitely a * hahah * inside it all .. i'm not jealous .. not anymore .. last time i'd pounce on her already .. i'm fine .. infact i just wanted to point it out to her ..  aaaaaaannnddddd .. apparently on the 24th .. leo installation day .. or 17th .. doesn't matter la .. a bunch of peepz saw her around ju's housing area at 12 something 1 .. and that was the exact same time ju nn got home from her movie .. apparently .. at first .. there was a girl in the passenger seat .. then when ju nn got home ..t hey saw her car again and saw no girl in the passenger seat .. or something liddat la .. i'm not very clear myself .. hrm .. she changed huh ? .. i can't say anything .there's no solid evidence .. i dun even feel like acting smart to kan toi her like last time .. i look at myself now and last time .. damn .. i was a total jealous and control freak .. it's quite scary actually .. it feels better now .. i love her .. full stop .. i dun love her till i can go mad like last time sorta thing .. so .. things are quite slumber for me now ..BUT .. the worst part is .. i STILL listen to her .. bleh .. that makes her in total control .. and she's more free i guess .. since i dun really bother ..  i could have sworn jac would call ju nn when she went home from my house yesterday .. hahah .. nvmla .. i think this post is longer then my other one .. hope is doesn't go missing again .. i can't wait to get ready .. i'm so freaking bored i need to get out of the house now .. hopefully we'd find a place to go after the movie and not argue about it ..
