Singapore will miss him badly..sob sob.. btw loi claimed that she saw "him" although we were so far apart..i think it's the feeling ba..nt sure. coincidentally, he's the motivator of yellow   sector and loi  i are also sitting at the yellow sector. is this fate?i suppose so . 如果爱一个人就应该尽力去争取，不是吗？ i think loi shld fight for her own happiness.       i am the most lucky one..=)so fortunate right? cos i am not troubled by relationship probs..and i hope i wun be in future as well. tml's going to be a busy day for me cos i have lots of stuff to do. one 创作，一篇叙别会感想和红楼梦！   i'll end here..good night n sweet dreams! all the best to singapore!   P.S:loi and i also feel that 阿兵哥are so damn cool! loi love those from SAF..=P
