Is Three Doors Down an okay band? Just wondering. I'm shopping at Itunes :) Lalla. I can't think of much to say except for the fact that I am disapointed in some guys these days. Like this really atractive guy at fred meyers. I would have stalked him BUT he had a hooters shirt on. I mean really. Thats disgusting. People these days..sometimes i just want to puke!  You guys have to never ever listen to 95.5, ok? At Itunes it has all the music charts for stations around us and like everysingle song they play on that station has explicet lyrics. I wonder if people ever get tired of hearing all that crap. It just seems to same kindda stuff to me "Baby, I love you" who cares? I mean really..if I cared about some famous persons love life I would read the magazine, not buy the cd. CD's are way to expensive anyways. And I  can just read the whole magazine in the store and not even buy it.  Some people say (like my mum) that I can never save any money and I alwaays spend it all. But that is totally not true. I do save money!!!! Just yesterday I have 68 whole dollars I saved. All those dollars were obviously gone by the end of today but still, I saved the money in the first place and because of that, I'm proud of ME!  And for the record, I am not bad at tennis. Everyone thinks that just because I am on the bottom that I stink at tennis. but I don't!!!! Everyone on my team is just really good.  An, I do kinda kinda KINDA like the song "Come Clean" because whenever it rained when I was little I would run outside in my little rain jacket and dance in the rain.  I reminded me of that CUTE girl in that car comercail where she is all lik e"Somedya, I will be walking down the asile" I love that girl. I just want to adopt her.  Ooh! This radio station in Phenoix has swichfoot at the #6 and #32 spots on its charts. What a dealio.  I can't think of anything to say and I am just going of rambling about things. haha. Its better this way. I am so sleepy I really need to work on my garden.  Ugh.  I don't want to go to schooool on monday. I think I might get sick for part of it ;)  I didn't get to go to a bookstore today so I don't have another copy of endurance. Ah! STUPID JONES SODA. Ugh. I am so increibly MAD.  Grr.  *weirdest thought of the day*  "Frankie Muniz has an album out, what the heck!"  Lalla. I must type until the day i die!  Which will obviously be MONDAY.  Hmm. They cheapest I can get a book off of amazon is 5 bucks. I don't wanna spend 5 bucks on this STUPID book.  In San Jose switchfoot is #4 and #8! wahhoo.  In San Diego switchfoot is #1!!!
