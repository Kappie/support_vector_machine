I have been training hard and now I have to take this week easy and try NOT to injure myself or fatigue myself too much so that on Sunday morning I am pumped and ready to go.    750m swim, 30km bike, 7km run    When I thought about doing this again I was hoping that my half marathon training would make it so that my run would no longer be the difficult part. However; with the injury that I have been fighting I am more afraid of the run then I was last year this time. The one advantage that I do have though is that mentally 7km no longer seems long to me! So that is good. I make sure that I leave enough in the tank to push trough that run! I want SO bad to beat my time from last year.    But I was reading an article in the triathalete magazine yesterday that says don't draw lines in the sand. So I am trying to beat down my goals and expectations and to just go out there this Sunday and give it my best. I know that I am NOT going to win, but a faster finish would be nice...But not necessary. I am going to do my best and that is all that I can do.
