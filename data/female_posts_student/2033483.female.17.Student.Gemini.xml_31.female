Before school:  Sean and all his friends came in, in their adorable suits for the matrix movie.  I don't understand the dressing up but they looked nice and whatever toots your horn.  Renae, then sacrificed herself to the hot hy-vee guy.  (How dare you AJ?  That's my nickname for him.   1. Algebra 2- took a test didn't finish, will do tomorrow. 2. Physics-First time I have come dangerously close to falling asleep in that class.  But I didn't feel very good in the morning so maybe that's why. 3. AP Lit and Comp- Took a test, which I don't think I did too well on.  But, thankfully my hand is still attached because we had to write a lot! 4. Lunch/Study-nothing 5. Chemistry- Chemistry stuff 6. AP History- Found out our test on Monday is going to be a huge essay test with one essay prompt and she gave us all the things we have to write about. Now if only I knew something about them.  I really need to read the chapters! 7. Newspaper- Did newspaper stuff.  I hope I saved my layout! I don't remember if I did before the lights went out.  Oh, and Joe Beck...nice kid!    After school- came home and was kinda grumpy, don't know why but was.  Thankfully, I finished my homework in time to watch some tv tonight.    Now I'm off to go talk to me amigos.  (Sorry Renae but Mr. Powers inspired me to use my Spanish)
