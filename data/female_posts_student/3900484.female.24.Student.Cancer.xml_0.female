My fortune from dinner says "your example will inspire others". I want to know how exactly that is a fortune. I mean, when did they stop with the actual fortunes and start with the cryptic messages? I wanted something like, "You will be very lucky tomorrow", or "That one thing you really wish for will occur within a week", or I would even settle for "You will meet a very handsome man and have fabulous sex". That's seriously not too much to ask for, right? I also got judged for my naughty behavior/attitude today. Sorta pissed me off.  I may have been acting like a petulant child, but I feel I have right to act that way when I want to. Especially after the past year or so. I've become a lot more involved with my mother because she is disabled and is losing the ability to do a lot of day to day tasks, like paying bills and other stuff that needs to be done. My computer is doing funny things, the font keeps changing size. ARGH stop. So anyway, I am not having a happy day. The only thing that really helped was the idea that I get to go buy a new shirt to wear with my khakis for my meeting (had to throw that in, still very excited). Oh plus I was going to clean tonight. In case anyone exciting gets to see my house anytime soon. (ie. the handsome man with the fabulous sex? I'm waiting...)
