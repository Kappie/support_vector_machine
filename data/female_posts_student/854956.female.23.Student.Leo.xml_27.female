I had a pretty good weekend.  I went to Austin to visit the crazy people I know there.  I stayed at Melissa's apartment with her and Stacie (one of her roommates... Alexis was gone for the weekend).  Anyhow, we had a pretty good time.  We went and saw  urlLink  The Ring  , and we also watched Clash of the Titans.  However, I must say, I had high hopes of getting to hang out with Wolf, but those plans fell through when Druck decided he wanted to come to Austin.  I must say, I was slightly less than pissed off about that.  Not to mention that he sorta invited himself to stay Sunday night as well... I mean, what does he care that Ricky and Wolf had to be up early to go to school and work?  HE wasn't going to go to classes and/or work today... Yes, I'm ticked.  It pretty much ruined my weekend as far as spending time with Wolf went.  Anyhow, today at school was interesting.  Driving to campus was horrible.  Walking from the parking lot to the HSS building sucked, too.  I got ALL wet.  However, I thankfully got an awesome parking spot... so I could've had MORE walking in the rain.  Classes went by... I was kinda in a daze.  Psychology was a bit less interesting than normal.  I think Dr. Baumann was in a bad mood or something.  Oh well.  Then Biology 2 SUCKED!  We watched some movie about how plants pollinate.  :-(  ACK!  It was SO boring... and he kept replaying things.  "Look at this butterfly... it's DIFFERENT.  It actually collects pollen as well as nectar!"  Well, JEEZ Dr. Jordan.... who the HELL cares?!?!  Sheesh.  Anyhow, I now have to read/study for my STUPID T/Thr classes.  I have a quiz tomorrow in music and one on Thurs. in World Civ.  BLECH!  It's neverending, I tell you... NEVERENDING!  Later on (either tonight or tomorrow) I have to drop someing off to the Morris household for Brandon and Melissa's Dad.  :-)  Okay, nothing else to say now.  If I'm lucky I'll get a chance to post something tomorrow, but, I make no promises.        urlLink  postCount('weekendinatown');
