I was going to spend all summer at church like a good little girl, but I officially decided not too and I haven't told anyone except for you, blogger.  See, this sounds awfully disrespectful, but I don't have enough time for church.  I want to maybe spend time with my friends? Or maybe not. They probably wouldn't invite me anyways.  I am glad Karsen invited me to her house. Even though I can't go, it meant alot to mean. I haven't been invited to spend the night at someones house for..goll, a year? Thats really sad. I can't remember the last time I spent the night at someones house. Oh...I think it was halloween at heathers.  I wish I was in my old house cuz then I would have a huge part and invite everyone but my hosue is too small.  *siiighhhh*
