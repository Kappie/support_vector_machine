(And because I am giong into physics for IB I doubt that I will need this ever again, or at least ever in high school.)  Ah, and then there is statistics in Algebra. Don't like them either, but I at least understand them.  Anyways... Back to things about which are worth talking.  I will answer Sarah's question. What bugs me the most....? Hmm...Interesting question. Let's see...I hate going over things 50 billion times! Like, in French, we'll spend SO LONG going over something that is SO EASY. We spend weeks on it! (And, that's not really the problem. THe real problem is that people hasven't learned the stuff from first year. By your 3rd year in French, you should be able to come up with a le/la/les or du/de/de l'/ des/ de la.) Same thing in Latin, only see Latin is a slacker class. You can easily do nothing.  But still, I rewally wish that our teachers would push us a bit harder and that we wouldn't spend weeks going over things. Although sometimes the vocabualry mistakes made by the juniors in my Latin class are funny. ( Like getting the word  manus  (hand) mixed up with the word  manibus  which is spirits of the dead. It makes for a great sentance: The pig fled from the spirits of the dead of the slaves.  Okay... I feel better now.  Moving on.... We have a theatre scene due Friday. Nathan and I know our lines forward and backward and we also know each others.  And YAY! Alison joined! Woohoo! My gentle reminder of CHECK YOUR EMIAL AND JOIN US actually worked. I am happy, lol! Now, I need to gentely remind Olivia....hmmmm.... 7 more days until my birthday!! YAY! And then one month after that, I'll be able to drive myself!! And no, Jane I will not be running into you. (More likely, you'll be running into me!) You'd better not though. I can't afford to pay that much for insurance!  Oh, yes. Everyone who reads this, plese post a comment with yoru favorite Disney movie. (Unless of course I already asked you.) :-) We got our projects for US history. Our group is doing Walt Disney :The man and his vision. Yay! Something fun! Not depressing like our last project, The Holocaust. We only get 45 minutes, but we're hoping that Collier lets us go longer considering we're the only ones presenting on the first day. Last time we talked for an hour. I am in charge of getting a poll of people's favorite disney movies, so please help the cause!! I am also in charge of the disney music, including musicals, which is also going to be fun!!  I will be quite surprised if anyone actually read all of this because a.)it was quite random b.) there was a large part of just ranting and c.) it was extremly random. Ah well. Yourmother is an aardvark.
