It just gives more to those that already have everything they need when those peopel that deserve it are the ones that won't get a thing. And liek a deserving person, we wait. We keep telling ourselves that i we keep waiting if we keep believing it'll finally coem to us. But how much longer must we wait? what if it never comes to us. Hopes fall. and sometimes it just takes soo much strength to hold on to a losing battle. we finally stop denying the fact that we're winning and come to see that we're truly losing. maybe we've already lost. we deserved it but who says the ones that deserve it are the ones that is going to get it? i'm waiting. still.
