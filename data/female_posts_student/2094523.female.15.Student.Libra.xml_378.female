I’m only living to hurt  I’m out here counting the stars I keep losing count, so I try again that’s what they told me to do Half my life is gone,  And I’m out here counting stars The sun rises another day I wait another night to count. morning comes I hear the crying I walk up to these familiar sounds They say roses die and glass ones are forever Why did mine shatter?  It went down with the others. Might as well drown me in your tears because I watch them fall each day Let gravity take me off the edge I’m only living to hurt Only breaking glasses roses Only counting these stars.
