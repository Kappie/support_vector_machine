On Thursday, the gang and I are going to Great Adventures and take our chances on Superman the ride!  Let see, I have 4 more days before I have to be back at work...I have to watch The Hulk, Finding Nemo, and The Matrix Reloaded.  Sigh, at this point I might end up waiting for these movies to come out on DVD.  Ching, I liked that Ad Design for Zoloff!
