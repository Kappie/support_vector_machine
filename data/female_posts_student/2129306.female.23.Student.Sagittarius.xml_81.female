My Pets   So since I'm getting a dog AND a cat next year for my apt., I have decided that they will be named MILO AND OTIS.  :o)  They're going to be adorable and I'm totally going to be one of those people who dress them up for holidays and pose with them for Christmas card pictures. hee hee hee...  Not much else except I am back in Springfield after a long  lovely Easter weekend and have plenty to do.
