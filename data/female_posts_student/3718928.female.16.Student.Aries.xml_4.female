With volleyball I haven't gone through withdrawl or anything from being off two weeks so thats chipper too, family is same old- I still get blamed for everything but I know there are other people out there in this big world that have it a billion times worse so I'm not complaining.  Recently though, I've been really stressed out about college and volleyball and all that crap.  I know I want to play division one vball in college but I have noo clue what so ever where, and I just keep getting more stressed because all these people I know are already verbally committing or at least getting offered *cough Yanz cough* haha I'm just kidding -Jess I'm so proud of you my little knitly lion or whatever penn states mascott is!  You deserve this and good luck!!! But anyways yeah it sucks, i really wish i knew where i wanted to go , or at least knew if someone wanted me at their college, but the thing is i'm not doing anything about it.  People are telling me I need to call the colleges and find out myself, but I feel so stupid doing that and I get really nervous and my confidence drops when ever I even think about calling coachings or visiting... oh well I guess I'll just procrastinate, haha I'm praying I'll get some answers deleivered to me after sept. 1st (cross your fingers!!)    Anyway after getting all those stupid worries off my chest I feel better and on another note stuff with friends is going well.  I've been hanging out with a variety of people but lately its been with a kind of mixed up new group which is really fun.  Kayli calls it the Cleesh (cliques or something like that pronounced wrong) and its really cool because I've been just having a ton of fun everytime we get together.  Oh! so the last few nights i've been watching the butterfly effects, with kayli, colleen, katy, braden, and mike and seriously it is a really good movie, so don't write if off too soon!! Well i'm off to blockbuster to get some good scary movies, hopfully.  Oh and FOOTLOOSE has the best music ever- everyone go buy that cd ! it makes me so happy!!
