If you actually believe that gay people, in fact, need this special rite, then by all means, why not be silent for the next 24 hours. And if you're like me and think that they're people just like everyone else, then laugh at the people that are being silent and talk your ass off. Either way, it's a day.  I get to dress up and shoot people and talk like a redneck today. What a suprise that it all happens in last period.  Fareyouwell.
