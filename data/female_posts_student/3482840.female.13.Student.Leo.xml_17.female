All I know is he's 14, going into 8th grade, and he goes 2 West G.  3) My mom got a new cell, and the guy asked if she wanted 2 put a celly 4 me on the account. Unfort, mom said "That's not happening until she's allowed to date and that will be a while!" O_O HELLO! I'm almost 14, I'm going into high school, and I always get good grades so it's not like I'm irresponsible... -_- She's impossible. She'll let me go out w/ KK ((eeeeww...)) but she won't let me even SPEAK to Andrew.   So so so SOOOO not fair! It wouldn't be a NEW kind of phone, just 1 like her old one. Just simple and CHEAP. But nooooooo... screw it.
