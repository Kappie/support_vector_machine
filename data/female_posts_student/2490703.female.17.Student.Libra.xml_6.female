There was a party at Mark's house but people weren't allowed to drink. So people from the party I was at went to Mark's party and told them that there was a keg at our party. It was crazy. People were getting mad that there wasn't any beer. There was a lot of smoking going on. I didn't smoke anything because I was the designated driver. Besides, I really want to give that stuff up. I got home really late, like 2:30, and I got grounded. So I'm home today and my parents took my car keys for the weekend. It sucks so bad. I need to get out of this hell hole, my parents are driving me crazy. This is the last summer that I will have to deal with them, then I will be free! I honestly can't wait.   I leave for CMU the second week in August. My official orientation is on June 9th. It's so awesome, I can't wait! I'm actually kind of tired so I best be off. I hope you have a great weekend! I'll talk to you later! Love you lots!                     Peace and Love,                        Melissa
