There was this guy from CT sitting still on John Harvard's lap. Apparently his car had broken down and he was stranded, so he just decided to perch there. Jenn thinks he's bitter about not getting into Harvard. While we were talking to the statue guy, a couple (the husband was hispanic, I think, and very tall, and the wife was a petite Indian woman) asked where the music building was, and we took them there, and then back out onto the Square.  The Yard is just so much prettier by night sometimes.   Then we crashed in Charlie's room.  There's just this kind of random bliss that comes with doing something completely unexpected. The only thing barring me from complete satisfaction, though, is the fact that we forgot Adam. He IMed me, knocked on the door...and didn't find out that we were gone until we'd come back. We'll take him tomorrow night.  After the Trivia Bowl, of course. Oh, I hope we do well.
