I've decided that I am going to go on a diet. I don't know what type of diet yet. But one that works. And it's not that I'm overweight and need to lose the pounds(I'm actually a bit underweight), but I want to get in shape and tone up and stuff. I've decided that I'm going to really stick with this, and it won't just be a two week thing. Hey, maybe I'll join Becka's gym! That'd be fun. And I'll start using my crazy ab roller, and I'll rollerblade a bunch n run a whole lot, and even work on those kickboxing routines. Ahh, the planning...doubtful any of it will ever come to pass...
