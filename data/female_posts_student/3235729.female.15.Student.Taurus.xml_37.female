If you try 'something' and the person doesn't say anything, even no, then it is considered sexual assault." Which brings me to something that the Cult (don't ask...) and I use all the time basically (again, don't ask...) "Silence gives consent". So, if silence gives consent, then yes can't possibly give consent, because  silence  gives consent. And if silence gives consent, then if someone says nothing at all...it's not sexual abuse. It can't be, because SILENT GIVES CONSENT, and the person was silent. SO THEREFORE CONSENTING. I suppose this topic is debatable. Maybe I just have too much time on my hands and I think and rant about too many things, too often...NAH! I love to rant. It's just a habit now. I think almost everyone of my blogs has a rant or a rant-related object in it.  I had drums today. Drumming is really fun and a good way to vent anger. I don't need to kick holes in doors and walls anymore!!! And...when I screw up, I can just beat the hell out of the drums, whereas when I screwed up when I took guitar I would have a coneption and end up breaking one of the strings. So...'tis a good trade-off. I'm startin to sound alright actually, and I'm not quite drumming at half the speed of smell anymore! I'm still a beginner though. And my drum teacher is both creepy and hilarious...at the same time...and his name's Mark. Coincidence?! I THINK NOT! Today he said something about he could tell when he looked at me that I liked to dance, and if I wanted to I could dance and drum at the same time. And then that song "We can dance if we want to, we can leave your friends behind" song ( everyone  knows it) came in my head, and then it was  really  hard to drum. Damn you Ashley. And erm...we have to switch the drums around every class because I'm left handed, and I accidentally stabbed him in the armpit with the hi-hat pole, and he's like "AHHH! FUCK!" then all of a sudden he's all calm and he's like "...I guess it's a good thing I am buff and have very muscular arm-pits." Now he's about as buff as an anorexic stick. I'll let you think about that one for a minute. And then he's telling me about how I should go crazy on the cymbol and he's like "Yeah...just go crazy...hit that cymbol like you...erm...never hit a cymbol before...yeah...I got nothing." It was hilarious.  So...school today. I was late for 1st and we did some gay myth shit. In 2nd we had a health presentation, in 3rd we watched a video, in 4th we learned about staffs and treble clefs and all sorts of shiney things like that, and in 5th...I have no idea. I never do anything in that class. She doesn't even care anymore, which is a good thing. Oh ya, I was late for 5th and had to sit outside for like 15 mins with I think a couple other people.  But yeah I'm tired and not really allowed on the computer at the moment. And plus I have nothing else to really say...so until I blog again...(which won't be too long so don't worry :D)...bye bye!   -Joebie
