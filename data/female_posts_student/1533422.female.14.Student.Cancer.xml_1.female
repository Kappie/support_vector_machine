So I can write what I wish about Clare and her slut shoes without Luke J.M. reading what I'm writing and constantly asking questions like, "What's Blogger?" and "What are you writing that for?"  Oh God, keep being added in a group convo with Mel.  Who wants to talk to someone who keeps calling you a slut and greets you with, "Hi bitch,"?  It's not even with a capitol letter! (You know that teeshirt that says, 'I'm not a bitch, I'm the Bitch and it's Miss Bitch to you.' Yeah, I don't even merit that.)  I absolutely hate Mel.  She's such a cow.  There's only so many times you can say sorry and still mean it.  Actually, I never meant it, but I was trying to keep the peace until she got up on her high horse and started ... well, doing everything she's done in the four days we've been back at school.  To show the world what she's like, I'm going to paste in an email she sent me, with my reply like, on it.  The italic is me, the rest is Mel.   Hi Mel!!  How are ya?    1)Ditching me   - yeah fine, but we've all done it, and I've apologised.  2)Bitching about me -  with reason!  3)Ignoring me -  with reason x10000.  4)Saying that you wanted to kill me in front of the whole class -  I've already apologised for that, and I didn't say I wanted to kill you, I said I wanted to live far away from you.  5)I gave you my Email password and you gave it to Jools, then she locked me out of it, you pretended you had nothing to do with it -  not true, I did no locking.  I just went on it, okies?  6)Bitching about me to the boys,(Pooj) that's when they started picking on me, it was YOUR fault Pooj -  ??  Mel, they've always hated you, and they always will hate you.   7)Being pissy with my friends when they've done nothing wrong. -  what friends?  Which "set"?  The ones you use in times of "need" or the ones you actually like? Cuz I've been pissy to neither.  It's YOU who treats the former like dirt.  8)When Ria said all that stuff about Clare you didn't believe me, then when you found out she did say it, you didn't even say "Oh, sorry Mel for making you a complete loner for two weeks." -  I hung out with you for a whole lunchtime when everyone else ran off!  And I did say sorry!  9)You used to invite me into bitch fights with about 10 people against me and you ALL used to have a go at me. -  Not even.  That was MSNy people.  I'm hardly ever online compared to most.  And I just don't do huge bitch fights.  I've watched Kate vs Melissa Walton ones, but I never join in anyway.    10)When I used to ask to sit next to you, you used to say, "Oh, I'm sitting next to someone else," then when I used to ask that person they used to say, "Oh, I'm sitting next to ANOTHER PERSON." -  Not even, not even.  I've never done that.  11)Even when I TOLD you I was pissed off with you, you STILL didn't say a peep about being sorry, I gave you one whole YEAR! SORRY DON'T  (Mel!  It's doesn't)  CUT IT NOW GIRLIES :@ :@ -  I don't remember being told.  And why would we say sorry after being told you are annoyed with us?  It's like, "I hate you," "Oh, I'm so so so sorry!"  And there's more, but I can't be botherd to sit here typing out a whole year to you little dickheads -  Just because there is no more.  You were strapped to find that lot, that other people did.    Charlotte said sorry in the summer of the Shells -  Like she hasn't done stuff since!   Clare said sorry Friday lunchtime -  which Friday?  Huh?  Lucy, Ria and Lauren never really had anything to do with it, they just follwed you. But Lauren said sorry before Christmas, Lucy said sorry in America and Ria didn't do ANY of it. -  Except deny bitching about Clare, and causing you to be a "loner for two weeks" even though you were with your "friends" and now you're blaming that on us even though you know full well I was nothing to do with it.  I wish I hadn't wasted that lunchtime now.  I just felt mean, running off and ditching you.  So I didn't.  And you know the thing Lucy whispered to me?  It was to run off and meet them in a place they had already thought of.  So why are you blaming ME for that?    YOU'RE SO FUCKING STUCK UP YOU'RE OWN ASSES YOU CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO SAY SORRY TO LITTLE OLD MEL, SHE DON'T  (again!  Mel, it's really bad grammer)   MEAN SHIT ALL, DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA THAT PUT ME THROUGH?  (HAHAHA.  Sorry, funny wording)  I'M SO FUCKING PARANOID AND CAUGHT UP IN WHAT OTHER'S THINK I CAN'T CONCENTRATE ON THE IMPORTANT THINGS. YOU MADE ME SO FUCKING DEPRESSED, YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT IT BAD JOOLS? HAH! TRY BEING ME! -  Actually, I don't think I've got it bad.  I did for a while, because it was much worse than it is for you.  But it's gone now.  And no thanks, I don't particularly want to be you, if being you is this pathetic.   OK, maybe it was the boys as well, BUT YOU WERE THE ONES WHO STARTED THE BOYS BEING MEAN TO ME    No.  We're.  Not.  They have always hated you!!  We can't start life-long hatred!!  We'd love to, but we can't!!      AND NOW YOU WONDER WHY I'M SO FUCKING ANGRY? YOU'VE TREATED ME THE WORST I'VE EVER BEEN TREATED AND BELIEVE ME I'VE BEEN TREATED EVER SO BADLY.  Aw, poor baby.  YOU WONDER WHY I SOMETIMES START CRYING AFTER THE MOST SLIGHTEST THNGS?  Well, you said it was because a certain someone had a terminal disease.  But now we're the reason ...?  IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU, I WAS A MENTALLY STRONG PERSON BUT BECAUSE OF YOU I'M NOT NOW.  IT'S NOT BECAUSE I'M ATTENTION SEEKING,  Oh, but you like Charlotte now, and it was her who said that.  And I seem to remember you running to me after she said it.  Hmm, funny old world, innit?   AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE I'M A GOOD ACTOR.  THE REASON  (isn't it reasonS?)   I PUT MASCARA ON NOW IS BECAUSE 1. I'M SO WORRIED ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK AND 2. BECAUSE I THINK IF I CRY IT'LL RUN SO IT STOPS ME.  Oh really?  Cuz I thought you wore it when you were a "mentally strong person" for that English photo, and decided you liked the effect ...    THANKS A BUNCH LADIES FOR RUINING MY LIFE.   How have we ruined your life?  You now drive the slut-mobile!!  I can't think of anything better for someone such as you.   Oh no, it's alright, you don't have to thank me for correcting your spelling.    Isn't she such a cow?  Anyone who has no clue who Mel or anyone is will not get that.  But then you can just accept the fact that she is a cow, and move on.  And if you ever meet any of the Parvis clan, SHUN THEM ALL.   I'm going to go now, because I'm talking to Elliott's best mate.  So everything has to be done with precision ...  *~Jools~*
