It was fun...I had like a billion customers. Yea, I like my job.  After that Jenn wanted to swim so Her and I went to Anna's again and Jenn went swimming since I was kind of tired....I ate ice cream....lol. Then we went home and Anna came with Me, Jenn and Sam to Papa Mio's for dinner. We went to Brea Mall to find some pants for me...That didn't work out b/c there is no way in hell I'm paying $42 or $38 dollars for pants...hellz no. Not when I know I can get them for like $24. But anyways Anna is taking me to get some tomorrow morning since I don't work till 2:30. Yuh....  P.S. How come you don't call me like you say you would.......
