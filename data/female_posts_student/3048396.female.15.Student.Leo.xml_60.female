Denny came over and worked on the computer so more cuz it still doesn't work right...but he got msn to work so yeah its good. Then I sat around and watched room raiders all afternoon. I was so bored. Then I went to Bible School and had lots of fun with the little kids. This little girl Sydney always has to hold my hand. Shes a real cutie pie. And Cassie clings to me alot too..so yeah. Its tons of fun. Then today was pretty boring too. Woke up early went to piano/organ lessons...great fun...came home sat around. Then Kim came over and we walked up town to find the rest of Ross' present. We had a great time lookin at cards.....there was some pretty funny ones. We were rollin on the floor a few times lol. Yeah. Then we came back to my house and watched tv n stuff..and now Im here writing this stupid thing....Well I've gotta eat now cuz I'll have to have fun with little kids soon. Yay! lol....
