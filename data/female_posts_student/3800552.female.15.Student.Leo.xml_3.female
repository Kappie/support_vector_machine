We were supposed to get something. . .Uh. . yeah But we would have to wait an hour to get it and we were supposed to be picked up at 8:30 and it was already 8:00. So instead we went to ASTRO. That was really cool. I saw Aida there, which was really cool since I haven't seen her in like 5 months. So I hung out with her, Lauren, Robby, Sierra, Derek and like a lot of other people. It was great. Then Sierra started freaking out and going all wacko. I'm not sure what happened. She was breathing really hard and laughing and She started getting really numb. I was scared. But about an hour or so later she snapped out of it. That made me happy.   So it turns out that me and Christine aren't friends anymore and that doesn't bother me one bit. She is still my friend. . . Oh well. Right now I am at Joey Colado's house with Sierra babysiting his little sister, Taedem. She's cool. . . for a 9 year old. I love it because we get FREE FOOD and INTERNET ALL NIGHT!! YIPPEE!! God, I effin' love this! Well. .  What else should I write about? Hmm. .  AHA! I tripped Angelia Gallehue today at Astro! It felt soo good! Only because she knows how to skateboard and I don't. .so HA! Well at least I did an 'Ollie' which is pretty hard to do! I did it twice! *high five!*  I think I need a boyfriend. A real boyfriend. Not like John. You guys don;t knwo John, so I'm not gettinginto that. All I can say is. .  Well a lot happened, and I feel uncomfortable saying it. Not even Christine knows about it. I never felt the need to tell her because she might think I'm a "slut" or something bad like that. I feel guilty. But at the same time I don't? I don't know. Haha. Eeew! I'm watching the Texas Chainsaw Masacre right now for the fourth time and it's still really gross. Not scary, GROSS. Which reminds me. I had to clean up two HUGE piles of dog puke today. YUCK!!!! It was rather disgusting. I think I almost made a third pile! lol. That would have sucked. Blah. I don't know what elso to write. I'm trying to make this entry really long because I have never done that before. Well, at least not THIS long.   Ha! Sierra and I traded pants and I gave her my "jizz" pants! lol. It's not actual "Jizz", it's glue. But it's on the crotch and it looks pretty bad! haha. I couldn't stop laughing about it! heh. Jizz. Hah.Oh my Gosh I love Funions! Sheesh! We're like eating all of Joeys food! I feel bad. But it sure tastes good! We had Goldfish, Fudge Rounds, Cheese Nips, Funions and Coke.I have to stay up all night and I'm already really tired. I don't know if I can do it. .  WISH ME LUCK!   Okay, Well I guess I'm done. Have a nice night/morning and I'll write to you later! G'BYE!     -Kat
