I wish I could hate you for what you did to me.    But I can't.    I've forgiven you for all the crap you are putting me through.  I forgive you for the future crap I will go through all because of you. And I hate myself for still thinking that we could be together someday. And I hate myself for still puting up with your shit. And I hate myself for still wanting to be with you. And I hate myself for still thinking about you every moment.   And most of all,   I hate myself for still being totally and completely head-over-heals in love with you.   Whatever. Those are just my thoughts on a certain person. You know who you are.
