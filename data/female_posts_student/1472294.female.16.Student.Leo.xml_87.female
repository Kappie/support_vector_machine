Not trying to depress or make  anybody  happy but i felt very tired coz everything time I studied very hard, the results will still be the same... OK, be happy, life's short.... I hope I am eligible to donate blood but I think I can't (they need age 16 and above). The red cross will be coming to our school on 15th August, but my 16th birthday is two days later.      -__- If they can stay for two more days, eeeerrrrmmm, maybe I will try. I have experienced needles pierced into my gums before, so I think thick needles pierced into my skin  should   be fine. (>_
