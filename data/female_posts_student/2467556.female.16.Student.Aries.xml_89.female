Nice, Austin.  sorry, i didn't feel like using caps in this paragraph.  Me and my mom were rebels today.  We told me dad that we were going out to get makeup and milk when we really went out for dinner.  It was fun.  We bonded and all that and my dad had no idea.  We were so rebellious!  I wore a skirt today because my wicked awesome bruises from playing goalie with no pads last month are gone now.  *tear* i loved those bruises so much!  Stars won today 4-0 over San Jose!!!!  yaaaaaay!!!!  We got 2 goals in the first 8 mins of the first period and SJ didn't get their first shot on goal until after 10-12 mins.  We beat them down!!!!  It was tight.  In other news, Colorado has lost every game since February 16th.  Haha you suck Colorado!!!  except Paul Kariya, because he's adorable.  They lost 7-1 to Calgary today and Vancouver is 1 point from taking them over.  Yeah, so today was an awesome day.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
