Moving is this horrible pain all on its own...but back on track.  I never know WHAT to pack...and I don't want to be like my sisters and pack my entire closet. I just DON'T KNOW WHAT TO PACK. I don't want to overpack but I don't want to leave stuff behind, you know?   But I think I've found a balance...just throw in some jeans and t-shirts and I'm set. As long as it smells clean it's fine. Kidding, it WILL be clean, seeing as I've done 3 loads of laundry. Ahh, no need for personal style on a trip like this...it's all vanity, anyway (But I'll probably wear some of my crazy shoes or throw in some of my more amusing shirts. LAURA! I could wear the "Ryan" shirt! Hahaha! I'm kidding). Throw in some CDs, a sketchpad and pens, and a camera, and I'm set. Oh, and books too. Man, if ever stranded on a desert island I'd be hopeless.   --end of rambling--  So anyway...if I don't get a chance to say bye before I leave...then bye, kids. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. Oh, and if you want me to bring you back a surprise, tell me before noon tomorrow!  Look for an audio post while I'm gone.  This is gonna be humiliating.
