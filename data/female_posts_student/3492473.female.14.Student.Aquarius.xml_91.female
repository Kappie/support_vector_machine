When am I gonna run out of tears? Will I  ever ? I'm  sooo  sick of pretending. I'm  so  sick of acting like I don't care. You have  no idea  how the fuck I feel right now. Earlier today I was sitting in my room  smiling  to myself over life. Smiling to myself because everything was  PERFECT.  Then everything  fell to pieces  in front of my eyes. I wanna die. I  feel like I am  anyways. And this fucking blog is a reason in this all. Two times tonight it led to things I didn't want it to lead to. And ya know what? Don't say you're gonna be there  if you're not.   I don't need to have my hopes up only to come crashing down.  You don't know  how bad  I wanna talk to you about this. You have  no idea  how you made me feel. You have  no clue  how bad my heart is hurting... I dunno what else to say. If you ask me what's wrong, I'm not gonna explain so don't even say it.  And no, you don't understand...
