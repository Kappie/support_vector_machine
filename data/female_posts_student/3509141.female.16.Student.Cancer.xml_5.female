None!  something i actually studied for wasn't on the exam, and waht kind of questions did we have? really basic ones.  we had 2 hours to do the exam, it had 25 questions and you pick the best answer out of four given choices.  i finished the exam after 40 minutes, sat there for like half an hour.  we all had to bring our dictionaries, and did we actually use them? no.    tomorrow would be my trip to Cayuga, it'll be 2 hours there and back.  fun fun fun.  and night, Rev. Mets and Mrs. Mets had invited me and lin to dinner, fun fun fun.  i have one more exam which i'll study for on Friday morning, and then write the exam in the afternoon, that way i'll remember more.  procrastination has it's own ways.
