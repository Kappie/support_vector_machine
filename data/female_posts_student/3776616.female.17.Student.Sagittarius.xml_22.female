The rapid strep test came back neg, but she said it looked exactly like strep to her, so she gave me amoxicillin anyway.  She's going to call me to tell me for sure as soon as the other results get back from the lab... Blah this really really sucks.  I can't swallow at all (go ahead and laugh, my sis laughed at that too -- that's NOT how I meant it), and I still can't talk very much.  I'm gonna go to the 4N6 meeting today, but I doubt I'll go to play practice.  If I can't talk I'm not much help am I?  Plus I'm prob contagious, so I don't want to make the rest of the cast sick.  Otherwise they'd all be gone on the days of the play, so I'd be the only healthy person, and I'd have to run madly around the stage trying to play all of the characters...  Oiy...    but yeah, Mande's on her way here, so I g2g.  Poo-head I'll talk to you tonight, Pookie I'll call you if I feel better, and Bethy I'll call you tomorrow, k?
