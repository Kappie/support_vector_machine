Theatre: exuberant musical or serious drama?  Exuberant Musical 5. Ballet or modern dance?  Ballet AND Modern Dance  :-) 6. Movies: major studio or indie?  Indie films are cool (like Memento and May) but I enjoy the major studio pictures as well 7. Authors: Shakespeare or Dr. Seuss?  Shakespeare 8. TV: PBS or A?  A 9. Music: Beethoven or Beatles?  I love both, though I'd choose the Beatles over Beethoven if I wanted to feel more carefree 10. Thought-provoking question of the week: You are a contributing member of your favorite art museum, and visit on a regular basis. They announce a new, temporary special exhibit by an artist surrounded by controversy...this person's work and/or political views offend you. Do you stop supporting the museum, or just stay away during the time the exhibit is there?  I'd just stay away... I wouldn't want to be hypocritical... and art by definition is a way to express thoughts/opinions freely... so it'd be stupid to stop supporting that just because I don't agree with what an artist thinks...
