"he came in thru the window, and it sounded like a crescendo. he came into her apartment, he left blood stains on the carpet. annie are you ok? are you ok? are you ok annie?" haha. that song is the bomb diggidy. thats some old slang right there for ya.."bomb diggidy". lol  i went to lees today for a while. that guy mcbride showed up with this chick name emily, his girl i think. shes mad cool. what else did i do today...oh yeah..nothing. ha. somebody called me once on my home phone and twice on my cell this morning and afternoon. everytime i answered the person wouldn'y say shit...they just sat/stood there or whatever. i think i know who it was tho. the number that called my home phone and cell was a cellphone number. i called it back earlier tonight to see if i would recognize the person's voice and it sounded just like fuckin tracy. as a matter of fact i know thats who it was. i know she would'nt call me and hang up but i put two and two together and figured who it was. the other number that called my cell and didn't say shit was campbell's. and i know he wouldn't just call and not say anything. so once again i know who THAT was. immaturity. these people have never heard of caller id..
