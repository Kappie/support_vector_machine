Missed it a little, but mostly Sam (and of course you Smauss…but your not really “home”…) Mom made me clean my ENTIRE room, but its pretty good looking now…Sam and I went out to an acoustic coffee lounge, it was really great and we just talked for about an hour and a half about our trips, and then just reminiscing and discussing life and how lucky we were to be such close friends. Then we picked up Nate and drove to another coffee place, The Mug, and Sam got me a biscotti lol. Great time.  I need a pic of you dearie for my wallet. I visited your mum too, helped her w/ the snakey pictures.  Sam and I are gonna take her out for ice cream  some day soon too, cause she’s lonely and misses you. J’kar misses you too. It’s 12:30, I’m tired, so I’m off to bed! Talk later dearie, and if you want, reply to my post on the guild! KissKiss.
