Why can't you just talk to me and tell me your thoughts because sometimes i think you want to continue and then time I think you want to stop. The search for the LALA doesn't end till you say so. I'm here and you can take it or leave it just make up your mind.  P.S. I worked today and got to see the security cameras and I need clothes....
