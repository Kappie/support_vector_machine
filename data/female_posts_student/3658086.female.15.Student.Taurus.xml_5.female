Anyway, wasnt really what I needed having just walked 16 miles in two days, and camping over night. D of E is in fact a nightmare, and so conveniently placed... the weekend before our exams... fantastic. When I got back discovered 5 texts and 7 missed calls, most of which were from lucy. She was kinda wondrin why I hadnt answered my phone for two days! Anyway, having sweet talked my way out of that one, she is once again happy with me!!!!!!!!!! She was taking the p*** about me and my sex life which i thought was rather rude!! Anywayz, I talk about her too much!!! Having not checked my email since friday night, I sat down at the computer happily expecting a few emails... my inbox was in fact empty!!!! anyway i'm off... laterz
