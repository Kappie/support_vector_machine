So fuck getting my license before I go to Dad's.  I plan on cheating the system.  Go to Dad's, tell them I just moved there, and never had a chance to take my drive test, and get an Illinois license.  I plan on living there after my senior year anyway.  The only bad thing about having an Illinois license is that I can't be on Mom's insurance because I have to have a Washington license, but I really don't care.  Rachel can drive me, heh.  At my ortho. appointment the nurse that was working on my totally fucked up, so I was there for over an hour when I should have only been there for 45 minutes.  The only good thing outta that whole damn day was the fact I got my hair dyed black.  Yup.  Jet black too.  I was told in the sun it has a little bit of a blue tint to it.  I've yet to see it, Phil says he has.  blah... Kevin just called and it's after 8.... fucker.  Lucky Nate wasn't sleeping or he'd have gotten beat by my family.  Ok I leave for Dad's on Tuesday!!  Oh yeah!!  Can't wait!  Gonna be kidnapped by Nicky and Sherri!!  I wanna go to GO.... We'll have to talk Nicky.  ok I'm done later dayz
