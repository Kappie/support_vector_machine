I can get my mom to pay for some of it, but if that would be too expensive/too much of a bitch to do, then lets go to MacDonalds or something, and then go to that movie that disses MacDonalds, or the other way around.  Also, I'm gonna quit my job as pornography minister, since nobody other than anwar has asked me for porn, and I think that was just random because I'm pretty sure he is illiterate, so wouldn't have seen this site. Plus for some reason in a club dominated by dudes, liking porn has made me enemies, which kind of disturbs me in its own way.   Admin. see comments for administration talk. btw when i talk of goos posts and bad posts i mean that alexs post on the GAT was a welcome postso was hillarys on Miriam. Peters post was agood as aone off and raised many issues concerned with discrimination. Harts wasnt that great. niether was jakes. Evans was about something but i think the type of posts that hart, jake and evan made were probably better relegated to the comments of some other posts. Please in the future. if you're unsure about whether to post or not get in contact with me through god_is_maxibonk@hotmail.com.  This post will remain open for people to have their say on administration issues.
