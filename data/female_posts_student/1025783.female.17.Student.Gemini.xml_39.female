She shakes her head and curls up in a ball One by one she drops them in her glass of clear Plink, plink and fizz... times 120 Slowly, methodically, until the bottle is empty Her eyes are big and round in the water's reflection Plink, plink, fizz, fizz She sings to herself She wipes off her mouth, and goes to sleep IT will all be over in the morning, she sings She closes her eyes and smiles.
