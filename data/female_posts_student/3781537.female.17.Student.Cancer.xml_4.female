I cant entertain people so it was kinda boring, but thats ok. They survived so i guess thats good. I slept on the floor cuz i wanted to be nice and give my bed away .. now my neck hurts but it will be fine soon. I think it only hurts cuz of the pillows i was using. I really dont have much to type today. So i guess im gonna go!
