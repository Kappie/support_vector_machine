Probably could have slept longer but decided to get up when I saw the time.  My head still feels somewhat foggy. When I can't sleep I don't think much of it because insomnia has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. In the last few years I actually go for days at a time hardly sleeping at all. Now it makes me wonder if I really am Bipolar. Certainly I wasn't always. I've got the diagnosis in writing but I still tend to think it's another mistake.  A screwed-up environment can certainly push a brain over the line. Have I really crossed it or has my mannia simply been medication induced? The pdocs can't agree. Some (most?) still believe meds can't induce mania unless BP already is present. I haven't felt manic when the nocturnal stretches hit. Nobody else has seen signs of it. I'm not generally even upset, although this last time I was. Usually I'm more interested in sex when I hit a nocturnal stretch. That's supposed to be a clincher.  I don't care about being "labeled" except that it annoys me when friends and family dismiss my feelings as just part of a mood cycle. Especially if I'm mad at one of them. "It must be chemicals in Cathy's brain. It couldn't be possible that I've been an asshole."  Anyway I'm glad I slept.
