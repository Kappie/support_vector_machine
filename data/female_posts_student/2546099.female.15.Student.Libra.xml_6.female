I found out even more about y they r fighting. I would say but i dont think i should. Im trying 2 handle it maturally, but i cant. I dont wanna have 2 spit weekends or choose who 2 live wit. I would be so afraid i would hurt 1 of my parents if i choose the other. I guess i know wat a lot of my other friends have been through now. I dont know wat 2 do...  Neway on 2 sumthing else, I did sumthing bad yesterday. I had a ciggie. I know sum ppl r gonna b dissappointed in me but i just wanted 2 c wat it was like. I wont do it again tho. Btw i wasnt pressured in2 it, in fact one of my friends wasnt very happy when she found out and she had had like 6 that day. I went 2 da movies last nite wit Mez, we saw Rotk. I saw it 4 the 2nd time. I think its the best of the 3.   Neway thats all i have 2 write, farewell.
