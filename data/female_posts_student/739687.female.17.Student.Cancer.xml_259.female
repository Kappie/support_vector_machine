But it hurts like crazy and I look like a gay ass when I walk, cuz my upper thighs are in super major pain. Also I have kickboxing at 10 tomorrow morning. Watch me die. :(  Today was good, by the way. Got progress reports, which is good when you have like a damn blow off semester. Had a test in Algebra that I thought was gonna be super hard, but then it was easy. And by saying that, I will jinx myself. I jinx myself alot. Like the other day my brother was sick and I was like "bah hah loser...at least I'm not sick." And the next morning, I woke up, and my throat hurt sooooooo bad. Luckily it went away after about 2 days.   pwnt:  CrazyLikeTHAT 87: nub SmarterChild: Um, that's you!  Haha greatness.  Hot Rod Circuit is a great band. Listen to "The Pharmacist". It's a great song. By a great band. Yeah.   "No, no, no!" *Shakes finger*  Haha, no no, you people wouldn't get it.  Oh my gosh, so the other day, Rachel and I went running at the park. And we saw these ducks having a threesome. I'm so not kidding. It was two male ducks and a female, and like one male duck would hop on and...ehhrrm...you know...and then it would hop off and the other one, who was waiting patiently for it's turn, would hop on and go at it. Oh my gosh, I never want to see duck sex ever again.  I bet you all wanted to hear that story.   I'm very random and sporadic tonight. Incoherent.  Ah well, I'd rather be cheerful and sporadic then morbidly, depressingly coherent.  Sure. Whatever.  Anyways, I think I'm gonna go. My contacts are kinda hurting and it's gonna take a while for me to stand up and walk to my room to take 'em out. Have a good evening crazies.
