       
      Sorry for my rather unceremonious disappearance.  I went home for Easter Break, and the internet situation is a little spotty there (trying to get my Dad to go wireless - perhaps I'll make it a Father's Day gift, as my father loves messing with things like that), plus I was feeling too lazy to blog.  It was a thoroughly unproductive week, if one looks to the traditional indicia.  But I did get to relax and visit with my family and go to my parent's church on both Good Friday and Easter Sunday, so all was not lost.  It was a very enjoyable visit.  Now the pressure sets in, now that I am back in New York and cannot ignore the work looming on the horizon.    That's about it for now.  Have lots more to say, but I'm really quite tired.  So off I will go to shower and then to bed.
