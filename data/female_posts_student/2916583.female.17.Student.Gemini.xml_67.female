It's a bit surreal, though.  It was like, this is the last time I'll be wearing mascara just to make myself look decent for three months (don't get me wrong, I'll wear it in Puerto Rico and stuff, but it will be jus because, not to look nice).  This is the last time I'll sigh a million times cause I have no idea what I'm doin durin a Math Analysis test.  This is the last time I'll hear those supremely annoying noises that are either coming from Roger or Alex.  This is the last time Dominique and I will dance down the halls in celebration.  This is the last textbook to turn in, the last grade, the last time I'll see Boswell.  You get the point.  I am happy to have a long break from waking up early.  Next year will be the last I'll wake up early by choice until I have a career (unless I have early morning college classes).  Wow.   There's lots to look forward to, though.  My cousin's wedding is on the 26, which means a major shopping trip soon, combined with a Puerto Rico shopping trip.  I need some spray in lightener, cause my hair was cornflower white the last time I went (seven), and it would be nice for it to be a bit lighter.  I definitely need some sun dresses, sunglasses, a sand castle building kit, water bombs, snorkeling goggles (we're swimmin out to a coral reef one of the days...hopefully my mom will let me go scuba diving too), sugar cubes for horseback riding, and some other stuff, especially flip flops and dress shoes.  I broke my last pair today (I've broken three shoes this week...it's not my fault if the straps are made cheaply).  Man, I'm in the mood for shopping now!  Anyway, I also have 4th of July, even if it will be sans big splash contest.   Well, I need to call get offline to call my mom.  Later.
