So I'll sit inside on this beautiful day and watch Wayne's World 2 cause that's just how cool I am. I just got back from the carwash we put on to raise money for the school newspaper. Fuuuun. Screaming on the side of the road with a crappy sign getting whistled at by Mexicans and 1/200 cars get their car wash. That's my idea of fun right there. Least I got my car washed. Sigh. Maybe I'll go shopping... by myself... with no money... hm maybe not. You think I could be creative enough to think of something besides shopping to do but sadly I can't.  Yesterday me Erinn and Josh saw Connie and Carla, it was cute, and definitely for gay guys. Lol. Then we watched Kill Bill Vol. 1 and wow.. it's so gory. Wow. Oh I did a good deed yesterday. I was filling my car with gas, and there was this poor doggie (with a collar) all scared and being stupid and walking around all confused on the very busy intersection of Coal Creek, and after almost getting hit by a couple cars I got him to the gas station and this nice woman was like "oh poor thing I'll buy him a hot dog" and the owner said he could stay there, and well my car was still by the stalls, so I left then... I hope the doggie's owner came looking for him. As long as he didn't turn into a dog-pie on the road.  Oh yeah yesterday was the DUI presentation at school... everyone heard that apparently it would make you cry, but we were like dude it's not real. See, they set up a mock accident, with two crashed cars and some students as actors all bloodied up and yeah. It was actually pretty gory. Like a million ambulances and firetrucks and police cars were there to "help" and yeah it was pretty hardcore. Then we had an assembly and everyone was crying because of this poem this guy read.... it was a good presentation. Good thing I never do drugs or drink alchy-hol! I rock.  I'm still bored.
