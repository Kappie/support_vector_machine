I finished my 6 mile run in a minute longer than expected, I came in at 107:43. Tracy and I ran together and we were talking about lifeand how he acted in high school. He is quite a bit older than me, I came to the conclusion that the 70's were a groovy decade. I would have liked to have a Volkswagen van when I was in High school, heck even now would be neat.   As Tracy and I were running a young lady joined up with us. Her name is Helen and she ran/walked LA's marathon last year. She ran with us till the end and later said you guys are to fast for me, I will stick with you up till mile 10 then after that I will find a pace group that runs/walks. I hope she will continue to run with us. She is an interesting lady.   Next Saturday we have an 8 mile run and Tracy won't be there, in fact he won't be there for 2 weeks. I am hoping to finish in a 11 minute mile and find people who are entertaining. I am sure that won't be a problem. I am looking forward to the challenge.   Have a great week. Run hard or go home!
