I can't quit because that would be kind of embarrassing to my dad and I can't work shorter hours because the arrangement is already figured out.  There's no way out.   This quote just popped into my mind:    "True Faith is not knowing that God can,       but believing that he will."  That he will what?  Save me from this job?  Get me to like it?  Start a fire that destroys the place so I never have to set foot in it again?  I'm tired and depressed. Good night all.
