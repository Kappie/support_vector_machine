Three cheers for the Festival of Bands for bringing in Sioux City's marching band today.  So Aliesha and I met for lunch at the mall, then afterwards Mary Katherine (whom from this day forward will be refered to as MK for my own convienience) and I hopped on over to Howard Wood.  I was greeted at the gate by Kurt and Ross... which were probably the last two people i had expected to see there.  As usual Kurt wore my jean jacket for about 2 min (and i still don't know why he does that) and when i got it back MK and i went inside.        I ran into Carrie and chatted with her a bit, then said "hi" to Chel and Beth.  I would have talked to them longer but MK was running around like a chicken with her head cut off (not really but it's a fun expression) so I thought i should stick with her or I'd never find her again.  We went with Nate to the other side of the field.... meaning we watched the bands backwards... until Chad called.  It was perfect timing because Nate had to leave, so then we went to find Chad and sit with him on the right side of the field.  So after running around in circles with Nikki (Chad's little sister who we ran into on our way to finding him) we finally got to sit down and watch.  The bands were all great, and Roosevelt was spectacular as usual, i just love all our visual stuffs.        So then we left ... but we didn't really leave b/c we ran into Ross and Kurt again (and once again i handed over the jean jacket for a whole 2 min) and then hung around some of the bandos before leaving.  Well MK and I didn't feel like going home but we DID feel like eating... so we figured we'd go visit Chad at the Fryin' Pan and get some Pie.  So we got some pie (pumpkin, my favorite) and brought some home for mommy.        Then, to top off my day... I started a Blog, orders of Kayla.  Thank you Kayla, you're an inspiration.  And danke Sean for all the html help.  Well guten Nacht, sleep well and don't forget to brush.
