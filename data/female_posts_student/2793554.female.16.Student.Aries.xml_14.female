Went home, my dad was trying to talk to me about some TV show he had seen that had to do with Star Trek and show me a new expensive toy he got added to his already yuppie Toureg. And then we had a huge conversation about kids at school, mainly cause I got in the car reeking of cigarettes and he wanted to know why...and he said he was proud of me. It was the wierdest thing ever, cause my dad is all "oh, thats great BUT..." and today he told me I was a really good kid and that he was proud of me. And i didnt even do anything. And he got all emotional about it... fuck... i thought he was going to cry which would have been horrific cause all i couldve done was sit there while a balding, yuppie, 55 year old man cryed like a kid who's just had their candy taken away and been smacked.  And then i went to hang out with crazy lesbians, and they were all over each other, watching anime. I never really thought about how much i dislike anime. Not like hellsing and shit... that is gooooood. But stupid anime. With high pitched voices and perky boobs its like a japanese playboy convention on acid. Found out my exgirlfriend likes me.  Again.  I miss Dylan. Why cant i be with him every single second of the day?  *All around me are familiar faces, worn out places, worn out faces... bright and early for the daily races... going nowhere, going nowhere.....*  I hate today. I want to stab it in the eye with a sword and watch the blood spurt out all over its stupid self.
