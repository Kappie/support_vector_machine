Normally, this would be fodder for the late night talk show guys.  And it probably will be.  But is it also possibly the most Presidential thing Kerry has done?  Fans of  urlLink the West Wing will certainly agree .  Or at least they'll not think I'm insane.  For those who do, read on for a description of the pilot episode of that show:   WHITE HOUSE STAFF HOLDS DOWN FORT UNTIL INJURED PRESIDENT (MARTIN SHEEN) RETURNS IN PREMIERE OF 'THE WEST WING' -- The entire White House staff bristles with activity when it's learned that the President (Martin Sheen)  injured himself during a bicycle accident , and his absence becomes a factor as chief of staff Leo McGarry (John Spencer) must juggle a host of impending crises, including a mass boatlift of Cuban refugees approaching the Florida coast and the reaction of conservative Christians to a controversial televised comment by deputy chief of staff Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford). Meanwhile, Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe), the trouble-prone deputy communications director, unknowingly spends the night with a call girl (guest star Lisa Edelstein) and then makes another critical error during a children's White House tour. The series is from Emmy Award-nominated Aaron Sorkin ("Sports Night," "A Few Good Men") and Emmy winners Tommy Schlamme ("Sports Night") and John Wells (NBC's "ER). Moira Kelly, Allison Janney and Richard Schiff also star.    The emphasis is, of course, mine.  The parallels are not absolute:  President Bartlet rode his bicycle into a tree and he was injured.  And of course, he was President already.  Still, perhaps Kerry should take heart, and maybe even make it a part of his campaign.  It couldn't hurt.
