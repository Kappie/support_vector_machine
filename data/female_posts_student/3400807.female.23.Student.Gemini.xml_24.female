Last night, I kept hearing Maria (from  urlLink West Side Story ) singing  urlLink “I feel pretty, oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and gay! And I pity, any girl who isn't me today. La-la-la-la-a-la-la-la.”  All in my head. I haven't seen it in... oh, probably well over a year. No one was watching it nearby or anything so I have no excuse.  

Today? Today I have the bit from  urlLink Fifth Element  where the guy tries to hold up Bruce Willis  and he hisses that he’s looking for casssssh. And the silly little dance. I remember noticing it, briefly the first time I saw the movie, but then when I watched it with  urlLink Ilsa , we laughed hysterically  (and rewound it about 5 times)  at that whole scene.  (What was the main character’s name? I forgot. Oh, according to the link I just sent you to, it's Korben Dallas. Incidentally, I don't exactly agree with the review but at least this gives you a good summary of the plot. Cheesy it may be, but I liked it.)  I was trying to find a link to either a picture of the guy or the transcription of the scene, but no luck. If anyone finds it, leave me a link, ok? I'd dearly love to have that! Anyway, I haven't seen that movie in... I'd guess about a year and a half.  

I’m so bizarre.
