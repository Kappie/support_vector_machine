As I sit and watch the snow Fallin' down I don't miss you at all I hear children playin' laughin' so loud I don't think of your smile  So if you never come to me You'll stay a distant memory Out my window I see light doing dark Your dark eyes don't haunt me  And then I wonder who I am Without the warm touch of your hand  And then I wonder who I am Without the warm tough of your hand As I sit and watch the snow Fallin' down  I don't miss you at all I don't miss you at all I don't miss you at all
