Rachel likes Nate and is nevergoing to see him again probably because she lives in Hawaii and says she will move back when she is 18! But, who knows! I have to poop! Today Rachel had her first kiss! I am really happy for her! Jenny, Rachel and I all met Nate Davis at Pierce Collage. Rachel met him for almost the first time. Except she has seen him before, a year before. Then she ended up tounge kissing him on the couch! I'm happy for her! I also saw Stephanie for the first time in a while today. Then my mom, Steph, Rach, Jenn and I, all walked to the park close to my house in Lakewood. We took Pepito with us. Then afterward we walked to Cameron Jergensons house to say hi. Except he wasn't there. He is in Canada right now. Ok I am done for today. Bye.     ~amanda~
