I thot it was brilliant, best movie ive seen so far. exceptionally high rating for it. maybe it was the hot daniel radcliffe maybe it was a rescue from confessions of a teenage bla bla bla. maybe its the directing. maybe its the comic relief of ron weasly. maybe it was the adventurous[sp?] feel. maybe it was the scenery. maybe it was the hot daniel radcliffe. maybe its the graphics. maybe it was the hot daniel radcliffe. maybe it was the hot daniel radcliffe.  it'll jus keep gettin longer n longer ___________________________________________________________________  Ron: The spiders want me to tap dance, but i don't want to   TAP DANCE  ! Harry: You tell those spiders Ron! Ron:  Yeah, I'll tell those spiders!
