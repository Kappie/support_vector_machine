I have no idea what I was doing wrong all the other times but it works now....although I'm not sure how many people read this because I noticed that Sean changed his link already on his blog to my other one so whatever, I like it better!  But I don't like how you have to be an xanga member to leave a message.  They said it was for security reasons but hey I just wanna hear from my friends!  That's it.  Just wanted to update you on the good news of the moment. ~kay
