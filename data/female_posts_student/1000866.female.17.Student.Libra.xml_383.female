I got an A on the math quiz I thought I bombed last week, but there was a new one we took today that i think I bombed too so...oh well. hopefully it will have the same outcome as this weeks. I highly doubt it, but it's worth hoping for.   Hmmm, what else, what else? I played with Wind Symphony. that was a lot of fun. It was funny too. Mr. Silder was talking about backward names and such and all of a sudden Kevin Lewis says loudly, "Wow, norkus backwards is Sukron." it was really quite funny.   So, we did have rehearsal after school today. Just sectionals and full ensemble with the weather being so icky. I kind of like it though. I like storms so, eh. So, we do that and we have dinner and everything and then they tell us we don't have to play at the game tonight and that we can go home. It was AWESOME. So, I came home took a shower, and went out with Chris. Then later we met up with Chris Zois, Nathan, Scott Oliver, Musto, and Carrie. It was awesome. We were kind of planning to meet with Nikki and them too, but I guess they didn't want to come up to the parking garage where we were because it was too cold. We were on the top floor burning incents sitting in the back of Chris' car. It was really funny. This cop car came by and he was really nice about it, but he's like, "I'm gonna need you guys to move." so, we did, and we went to school. Haha. How ironic. to be at school on a Friday night. We went into the band room and jammed for a while. Very cool, very coo. I refused to outright solo though so...eh. Then we just took everyone home which took like...half an hour haha. We jammed everyone in Chris' car. Very funny. So my evening overall was very fun/funny. Whoo, fun fun day. and Bryan's coming tomorrow now!!! Wooo!   :)
