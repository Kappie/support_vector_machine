Though that was occasionally *also* funny - yes, I'm weird, do you have a problem with that? ^_^  Loverly loverly time at Central Park, rolling around in the grass and throwing the frisbee badly.  Quite fun, though depressing to watch all the other people who are better than we are.  Kind of sleepy . . .thinking of gondolas . . .or is it gondoliers I'm thinking of?  Wouldn't you like to know?!  We're graduating . . .and I'm still not smart. ^_^
