So yes. It's been a completely unproductive two days. Homework wise, I've got about four maths exercises to do, a whole lot of Japanese stuff plus a test to study for, and Geography work. And I don't care. Ee-yah!  Wanna read my essay? It's riveting, that much is for sure.   TWELVE ANGRY MEN, POLITICS AND PREJUDICE. ‘Prejudice Obscures the Truth’
