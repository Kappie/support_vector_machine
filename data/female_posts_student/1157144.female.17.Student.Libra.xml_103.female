'cuz we have more fun with each other as a group anyways. ^_^    and yeah, are we doing anything tonight?? i can't stay out that late 'cuz i've got field hockey tomorrow morning, but it's a really nice day outside, and yeah. someone please call me if we do something  and yay for bryan with his license!!! ^_^  i think he wins for having the nicest car. but yeah  fun stuff.
