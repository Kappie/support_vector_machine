I am quite proud of myself and I probably will go back and do it again today.  I am also taking an aqua fitness class at the gym.    This Friday is the birthday suaree for  urlLink Anna  and I, thrown by our fearless leader,  urlLink Missy .  Woot!  Also, my birthday is on Saturday...that is three days away! Yay!  I am so excited becuase for the first time in 3 years I get to have a birthday party!  Yay yay yay!
