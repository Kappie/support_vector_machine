That is going to be in a couple of years and i dont think i will be ready for it.  i dont have any idea of what college i am going to go to anymore and an even smaller idea of what i want to do. i think i want to become a history teacher. But i dont think i could handle talking everyday in front of 20 people. My other idea is just as bad because i wanted to be a lawyer which still has me talking in front of a lot of people.  I am just scared about the unknown.       Also, graduation had me thinking about next year.  i have had such a wonderful year and such wonderful teachers, i am scared next year may pale in comparison.  Its like everything has gotten where i needed it to be so i just have to wait for the other shoe to drop. sorry to use a cliche but it is my favorite since mjf used it.  I have grown a lot this year. Like last year, I was so crazed by tv, the real world was passing me by.  I lived in the real world this year, it is amazing what can happen. better than any tv show.  i have absolutely loved this year and its almost gone.(i mean school year by the way)  it has gone by so fast and i have enjoyed every minute of it.  i had promised myself i wouldnt let this year pass me by and that i would enjoy every minute of it and i didnt always do that.  now i am regretting it.  Just, people, dont let life pass you by.  Enjoy every moment. They are precious.  I sound like someone who is about to die.  I probably will once school ends.  It was something to look forward to everyday. Soon i will have nothing.  Work and home, with my mother,  sounds like fun.  okay i guess i have gone on long enough. i will go now. good night everyone
