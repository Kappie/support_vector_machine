The infamous kiss today...my lord, I thought yall people were gonna die! lol...It was sweet and if yall were in their shoes, you'd do it too!  Its only a few more days till she graduates, then a few more days after that and I'm gone for a month...she leaves sometime around july 1...she cant make a phone call till July 18, and its for 10 FREAKIN MINUTES!!!! She's gonna try out for cheerleader and if she makes it she wont be able to come home for thanksgiving, or christmas.  :'(  I dont know what Im gonna do.  I know she can do it...hell, she's been beatin on me since I was little, Im proud she gets to take it somewhere else now! *sigh*  she'll be great.  she's tough mentally and physically and no matter how bad I dont want her to go, this is an oportunity of a lifetime.  The Air Force Academy accepts 9% of their applicants on average.  That means that its harder to get into the Air Force Academy than HARVARD, PRINCETON, AND JULIARD!  Everytime I hear a song like letters from home, or american soldier, or something like that, it makes me want to just break down and cry b/c in a few weeks....THAT'S GONNA BE HER!!   I CANT WAIT TO BE GONE.  you say you're gonna miss me, but you know, when I get back, I know things aren't gonna be the same.  I have to beg you to tell me stuff now....am I gonna know anything when Im like 1000 miles away?? um thats a BIG NO!!! oh well...atleast someone's happy. maybe.....for now oh well.....screw it...."Dont try to tell me what to do, Dont try to tell me what to say, you're better off that way"   Me and Becca have been talking more lately and Im soooo excited about that.  Its good b/c both of our sisters are going to college, colorado springs, and northeast are kinda diferent geographicly, but....its still good to have someone to listen to ya! She's gone to look at a golden retriever today and Im sooo excited b/c I love those dogs, but it wont be as purty as Shelby (my yellow lab) no matter what!!!  Aubrey....bless him....I think Im gonna miss him the most.  We dont fight, We dont argue, we just get along, it just works, and I love him to death!! He's sooo sweet, and I couldn't ask for a better friend...*so take some notes yall* If he doesn't write and call, Im gonna kill him though! lol, nah, you know I love ya, but I will be higly pissed! "true"   .....between "us"........I just wish things could get better,  yah, I screwed up by saying that with your family there, but I didn't know your dad was there, and I really dont think anything I said was bad. Its really not my fault you dont tell them anything.  They were eventually gonna find out that the golden child image wasn't true!!!  I wanted to call last night and say sorry for everything, thanks for everything you've done for me in the last......like 4 years.  Its closing time now, and as much as I never thought it would happen, it is.  You've given me more than I could ever ask for, always there for me, always listening, no matter how stupid I acted, or how dramatic or bitchy I was.  I know I take a lot of things out on you and hopefully things will be easier for you now.  You know Im ALWAYS here, Im just tired of seeing you mad at me...Id rather know that theres nothing there than know that theres something but its not progressing!   I love you........  SOME OF MY FAVORITE SONGS AS OF RIGHT NOW....   Dwight Yoakam  The Back Of Your Hand   when you give it up for gone but you're still digging in the mind and you're staring out the window  saying everything wil be just fine keepin with whole affair every word seems out of line no matter what angle you get its polished til it shines   take a guess at where i stand pick a number one to two take a look at the back of your hand just like you know it  you know me too   and when you say who the hell am i living with what just went down where did this come from why are all my colors faded brown when did it change whats with the rage  whos the dude with the extra roll whats the verse, the line, the chapter, the page   take a guess at where i stand pick a number one to two take a look at the back of your hand just like you know it  you know me too    you think you're alone without any place left to go like you need one of those kisses long and slow first glance is not what it seems but there's some things i just know like you take two sugars with a splash of cream   you take a guess at where i stand  oh pick a number one to two then take a look back of your hand just like you know it you know me too yeah like you know it you know me too just like you know it you know me too    Randy Travis  You and You Alone     When this old world gets me down And life's a chain I drag around When I can't find a ray of hope To help me sooth my worried soul  Only you and you alone  Can turn the darkest night into dawn  The only reason for hangin' on Is you and you alone    Holding you close to me Gives me all the strength I need Then I wake up, it's just a dream All that's left are memories   Of only you and you alone Can turn the darkest night into dawn The only reason for hangin' on Is you and you alone   My only reason for hangin' on Is you and you alone.    Keith Urban  Your Everything     The first time I looked in your eyes I knew that I would do anything for you The first time you touched my face I felt What I'd never felt with anyone else    I wanna give back what you've given to me and I wanna witness all of your dreams Now that you've shown me who I really am I wanna be more than just your man    I wanna be the wind that fills your sails Be the hand that lifts your veil Be the moon that moves your tides The sun comin' up in your eyes Be the wheel that never rusts Be the spark that lights you up All that you've been dreamin' of and more So much more I wanna be your everything   When you wake up I'll be the first thing you see and when it gets dark you can reach out to me  I'll cherish your words and I'll finish your thoughts  I'll be your compass baby, when you get lost  repeat chorus   Be the wheel that never rusts Be the spark that lights you up  All that you've been dreamin' of and more So much more I wanna be your everything I wanna be your everything I wanna be your everything   Brooks  Dunn  That's What She Gets For Loving Me     She said what she wants is a man to be faithful A true heart somebody willin' and able To stay by her side through thick and thin A tender touch every now and then  She's not hung up on fairy tales Or some dream at the bottom of a wishin' well Fancy cars or diamond rings What she wants most are the little things   That's what she gets That's what she gets That's what she gets for loving me  At times I lay awake at night Stare at her laying by my side Knowin' there in her heart as she sleeps She can forever count on me  That's what she gets That's what she gets That's what she gets for loving me  Whatever turns her on I'm here to do it Till the day they write my name in stone I'll live to prove it  That's what she gets That's what she gets That's what she gets for loving me   That's what she gets That's what she gets That's what she gets for loving me   Change a couple him's to her's and man to woman, and she to he, and its my life....all wrapped up into a few songs....if you only knew!! no, these aren't just about CK...he's just one of the most influencial things in my life...so what, yall have 'em too!
