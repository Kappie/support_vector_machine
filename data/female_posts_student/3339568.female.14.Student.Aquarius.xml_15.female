Oh, well her loss.   The day started of with artt with Criddy, where we were forced to clean up, Han and I turned the radio up REAL loud and danced around until she screamed at us to stop, but we ignored her neway! Then afta we'd finished wiping the benches, we had 2 clean out the art cupboard which like hasn't been cleaned since 1985. We complained about doing it so now she's giving us all (Han, Gem and I) a Killer Python Gummi Snake. Mmmmm... bribing with lollies always works! So we were cleaning out this closet, and we closed the door behind us, and its like a mini claustrophobic room, and we saw that the window was bricked up so we were scared that Simba and Hammy and Criddy were gonna brick us in so we opened it again :D Han proceeded 2 pick things up off the ground with pliers, and we pulled at this piece of string 4 ages until we realised it was in a big roll. Criddy came 2 see how we were going and she got her feet tangled up in all the string and didn't know and was walking around the room like a lunatic with all this yellow string around her feet, it ended up falling off, but man we were shitting ourselves laughing 4 a long time there!  Next up was Maths, and as a "treat" as Mr.Ryan put it we watched the "Right-Angled Triangle" video. Traumatising stuff really. 4 any of u Roseville girls out there, that includes ur Rach, u should know  exactly  wat I'm talking about. 4 others, just try and imagine this crazy lady, with 80's clothes (think puffy cuffs) and permed hair. A high-pitched voice and MASSIVE eyes, banging on a triangle singing - "Right Angled Triangle, Right Angled Triangle, equals the square of the hypotonuse...." It is soooo scary and funni. Oh, and I once again tripped ova Mr. Ryan. oops :P  Den we had morning tea, and there was a cake stall, and a MASSIVE line 4 Krispy Kreme donuts. Slaves were sold, and most of them went 4 about $30 (rip-off!) but Batsey sold 4 $50!! Walking back to our spot we saw many Year 12's giving piggy-backs to their "masters" and crawling down the Hinemoa stairs. Crazy. We had to clean-up during Tutor Time and I finally got to swap lockers with Shannon (grr....) so now I am TOP LOCKER!!!!! woooooo......  Then we had Science, we did this sheet with tests 4 our eyes, to see blind spots and stuff, and we had 2 try and trace around a star by only looking in a mirror. It's harder than it seems! but it was fun. Then Annie and I proceeded 2 have leg fights bi swinging on the lab desks,a nd running around screaming and jumping ova chairs. Good 'ol Mrs. Hallet let us have our fun :D Then Annie ran out of the class and came back with a balloon and blew it up and it was really long and fat, so we played with it then decided 2 call it "Annie and Beth's End of Term Eggplant" and we got everyone 2 sign it. It was majorly cool!  In English we watched the end of Baz Lhurman's Romeo and Juliet, which mite I say is really crap. It's got Leo DiCrappio as Romeo, so all ur thinking about is Titanic the whole time, he even smokes like Titanic, speaks like Titanic, draws like Titanic, swims like Titanic and looks cold like Titanic. Man it's like a copy. And why, may i ask, is Mercutio a  cross-dresser ?! That neva happened in the play. It's a totally retarded movie. But we got 2 see Hammy's new haircut which is totally hanous!! It is short and bob-ish and is lighter brown and she has a fringe, its so unco! Han and I had 2 stifle our laughter wen she walked past and we saw her 4 the first time this morning.  Lunch started with us waiting in a line 4 like an hour, only 2 find out it was the drink line, and then we had 2 wait in a mosh pit of a line (u couldn't even really classify it as a line!) 4 another 15mins 2 get our sausage!! We were suffocated!! When we got back 2 the locker rooms, we found out that the list 4 who got into Middle School Performing Arts was up!!  AND WE GOT IN!!!!!!  We were so damn excited! Because hardly anyone got in!! And we did! Wow! And we beat Amelia and Lucy, they didn't even get in, and they thought they totally would, and they r pretty good. But they were sooo pissed with us that we got in and they didn't and they were crying and everything, and bitching about us and giving us greasys as well, but i didn't care because I was so happy. And then Sian and Kelly were annoyed because Amelia and Lucy wanted 2 be in their dance and they didn't want 2 (because they got in) and they were sooo pissed. And Kim Asjberg didn't get in!! haha....and she had a physco and started bitching bout Jen and Millie's group that got in and I told them so they were angry at Kim and Kim was crying that she sisn't get in and everything. It was soo hilarious. And we went 2 tell our group, and they were having this full-on God discussion and didn't want 2 listen 2 us, and they were totally oblivious 2 everything going on around them! haha  So now.....Cheerleading with Melissa NSC what 2 say. She's a freak. She was feeling espescially bitchy 2day, and we were trying 2 learn an  urlLink Elevator  stunt, which is a promotion from our usual boring  urlLink Thigh Stand  and it is really hard 2 do (the elevator) and i had sum1's foot in mi face and it was killing me and I was collapsing under her weight, and she's like u two (Han and I who were the bases) leave and let's get 2 other bases. We were like "Fine! Bitch!" It was quite mean. She totally hates us. We got her 2 sign our eggplant balloon, and she gave us a weird look, but did it neway, and she wrote -  "Cheer hard or go home, Coach Mel"  What a weird message! And she attempted 2 draw this pic of a cheer person. It was funni. And she did more cheers 4 us - haha. "Push that ball, push that ball!" So yeh, that's our freako coach. I am now in so much pain from having people constantly stepping on me 4 2 hours straight, being base and all. But we combined our stunt stuff, by having a group on the outside doing thigh stand, middle doing elevator, other side doing thigh stand, and we all connected it together so it is like 1 big pyramid, and then we took a pic. :D I'll put it on the blog once I get it. But it's pretty cool. We look like we're really good.  But yeh, that was my day. It was pretty fun. I got mi report we I came home and I'm really happi :D They rank us out of all the people who take the subject and 4 English I came 1st out of 107 (1/107), Maths Advanced - 42/59 (so that was relativley shit, thats because the exam was realli hard and i shitted it up!!) Science - 29/104, CCG - 52/104 (haha - hate CCG!!!) CCH - 7/105, French - 3/25 (yay - worked hard 4 that 1 - we had 4 exams 4 half-yearly 4 the 1 subject!!) History - 2/66 ( I was No.1 for 1/2 hour, then Ai Lyn came and said "U didn't read mi last paragraph of the extended response", so she got an extra mark, and beat me bi half a mark! grrr.....) Visual Arts - 6/32  Oh and Mrs. Smart (CS) said I should "be more forthright in sharing mi ideas" which is absolute bull!! I always share mi ideas, its just because no1's listening 2 me, so when jess is presenting an argument, its usually mine, and im whispering next 2 her telling her what 2 say!! Ahhhh......that is sooo annoying!!  Well i betta go and start doing stuff B4 small group! Wow, that was prob. the longest blog I've eva done!!  Bloggin off, Beth
