Any hoo, now you're just gonna have to use the comments system *like any one's gonna want to comment on my crap* Please, don't even think about commenting on crap! Well... this crap, but not crap. You know? Yeah, I think I should shut up too! Any hoo I'm gonna kick this a bit more and check it out until I'm happy that it's working *KICK KICK THUNK* Thunk? Ahh, I hit it! OWCHIE! Damn computer... better go bubi!
