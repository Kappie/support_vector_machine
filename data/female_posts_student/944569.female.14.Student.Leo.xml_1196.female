Well, I hope I'm making things less deserted ... probably not because I don't have anything interesting to say... but I'll try.  I'm listening to "Hey Jude" now.. it's a very addictive song... very good too. I think I'm going to listen to "So Beautiful" next...   I really like the new template for the blog. It's very pretty! How did you do it?   hee hee.. i'm so happy it's the long weekend!!
