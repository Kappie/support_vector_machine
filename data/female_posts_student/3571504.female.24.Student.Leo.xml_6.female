I think my butt would disagree with me...I have had diarrhea all day. (Speak of the devil, I have to poop) Okay, I am back.  Well, I know this is bad, but all I ate today was dinner.  I had a headache and did not feel like eating earler.  So I ate the following today: 1 1/2 chicken breasts with serendipity seasoning  A few bites of mexican rice (it sucked so I didn't have a lot.)  A packet of La Creme strawberry yogurt  20 oz. diet coke Water  That's it!  I swear, no food lies here.  My butthole hurts though.  Courtney
