It seems weird to him and I that every morning we tell eachother what we're doing, and some days go by and we have no idea what Ashley plans on doing or anything. I think it's going to take getting used to again. I dont know if she realizes that everything that Bill and I do, she's invited. Maybe she doent know that, I dont know. It's weird hanging out with someone who has a life. I've been with Bill so long, I'm the center of his world..but with Ashley there are so many other people to 'worry' about. :-P..It's going to take time, but I'll get used to it. hehe...Anyway, i miss her so much. She IMed me saying that she probably wasnt going to be on for the rest of the night, and it worried me. :( I wont be able to say goodnight and sweet dreams back. I slept with Darwyn lastnight, hehe..I've never slept with him before and I've had him since 6th grade. He's been sitting in a closet ever since I got him...he was extremely expensive and I never even did anything except sit him in a closet for a couple of years. hehe...I'm happy that Ashley is going to take him. :-D It makes me so happy. I'm going to try and put the picture on here of Ashley and Darwyn, even though she hid, AGAIN. Welp, I'm going to go and try to put that on here:)  I MISS YOU ASHLEY! I CANT WAIT TO SEE YOU AGAIN...xoxoxo
