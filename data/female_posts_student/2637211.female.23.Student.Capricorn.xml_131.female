So I dunno why I'm even posting, just felt the urge to type out my emotions and drama. I should be reading, but I'm distracted by the idea of blogging. It's actually an interesting book, just got to get further into it. It's Tolstoy's Resurrection, for my lame "Fall of the Russian Empire" class. That class can really blow. Not really sure why, but I think it has a lot to do with the aged history professor. He's such a cliched stereotype, it's not even funny. Normally I really dig history professors, because they're a lot like me, only more devoted. But this guy is seriously from a different generation and it's very apparant in class. He's such an old man.   I think my main weight loss plan is to eat smaller portions and drink in place of candy and desserts. And if I only drink mostly hard alcohol drinks, there'll be less chance of beer gut. Also, I think I'm going to try to ride the old bike on more errands, and start rationing my tv time. It's a huge timewaster and butt grower. Seriously, it's a bad scene: it robs me of momentum and makes me forget that I'm not interacting with human beings. Also, I need to limit my internet time, but I'm fully addicted. I'm waiting for the day when wi-fi covers the world and we all have hand held, *cheap*, or even free, access to the web always. It'll be creepy, but awesome. Then I'll never have to cut my umbilical cord of the plethora of information.
