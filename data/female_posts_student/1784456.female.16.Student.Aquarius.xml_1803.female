I have gone properly potty.   Today I went to school and participated in two exams.  English was interesting to say the least and I feel that geography was a breeze.  O for all people who do not know the first history exam is MEDICINE THROUGH TIME.  Just to make it clear I put it in capital letters.   There is a guy opposite my house who has a mohawk that goes all the way down infront of his eyes, how annoying!!!  Strange also.  I think to curb my boredness I shall go to bed or something, I probably wont get alot of sleep tomorrow night because Anna and Jess are staying over.  It should be a laugh, only 17 days until we fly to Paris.  I'm so excited!!!! AGGGHHHHHHHH.  Right controlling ones self.  I am going to go and make a sandwich and eat it! Toodle trundel xx
