(maybe that's the key--have fun, then say goodbye!)  and i know that she's coming back, since she wants to go to college here.  i'm going to bleach my hair yet tonight--i'll have pictures up soon.  oh, by the way, if anyone happens to read this--you radiohead fans are fun!  (ahem...at least those of you whom i talked to on AIM the other night:])
