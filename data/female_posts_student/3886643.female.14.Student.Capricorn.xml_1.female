We couldn't get the birds, they were just too quick! haha...Then i was messin around walkin around the house and peekin out the front door with my thong pulled all the way up (it was hello kitty! haha)....Then i got a freakin Camel-toe and it hurt like shit so i had to pull it down, lmao. Then i had to get in the shower. Then i got dressed. Then me n Julie headed down to the Hall's house to pick-up maggie hall. Then we walked up to The Cooke's house to deliver maggie. Then i went to the Straup's house to babysitt Maggie, Hanne, and Eli. That was Fun...about 4 hours of chaos! woo hoo! then i got 20 bucks and went home. On the way home i spotted alotta fire trucks and stuff all over my street, it turns out a big ol branch fell down and hit something....now it is sparking...i guess it fell down and hit lightening....haha....o yea im like one of the only ones with full power on my street :D!....Then when i got on the internet this jerk talked to me and ruined my night (did i mention i hate boys and im going to be ordained? Must be my calling since everytime i really like someone sumthin bad always happens)......Anyways now im just sitting here bored as crap...o yea Fil sorry for prank calling ur phone like 6 times today! :D...And Tommy i was just playin with ya!..haha.......*im Out*
