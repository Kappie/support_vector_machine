Bush and gay marriage pisses me off!!!!!!!!He talks about how the bible says the marriage is a sacred union between a man and a woman. WHAT THE HELL!!! You cant use religion for an arguement for something legal for the folowing reasons1. What happened to the separation between church and state? 2. Not everyone in the country shares the some religion so why should everyone share the same law based on what a bible that doesnt even represent what they believe says? It makes me so mad. This country cannot have a Leader who doesnt represent all walks of life. When are we going to have a black president, or a woman president, or a jewish or muslim president. Its just bullshit....I dont like either canidate for the upcoming presidential election. Theyre both retarded. But honestly if i had to vote i would vote for Kerry. I hate him too, i just hate him less than i hate Bush. I wish i could vote, this is the guy whos gonna be the President when im 18. He is going to have serious power over my life. But i cant vote, all i can do is bitch in this journal and hope some people with sense are at the voting booths this year.  Thats all for now...     P.S.----Does anybody know the names of the guys on room raiders the other day It was the one where the chick took a bath...2 of em ere pretty fuccin hot haha what has my life come to? yeah e-mail me if u know or post
