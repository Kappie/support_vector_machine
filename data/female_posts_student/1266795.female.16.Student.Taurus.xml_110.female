Chad Michael Murray was cute in his football uniform although you don't get to see him in it till the end of the movie.  other than that, it was a typical movie that was really really predictable in every sense with some pretty cheesy lines.   as for other news, I no longer have a job:( today was my last day working at papa murphy's and lifeguarding/teaching kids how to swim ended last monday.  i no longer have anything to fill up my days so i shall be online quite a lot.  good news is that i broke my $1000 mark thnx to lifeguarding.  that's probably not going to get touched too much cuz it's most likely going into either my college fund or a car fund. in order for me to get a car, i have to raise $5000...that's not going to happen anytime soon...hehe. i don't mind though, as long as someone else can give me a ride, i'm happy. driving isn't a big part of my life although it's more accomodating for whimsical events.   only 7 days till move in day!!! we definitely should get together sometime next week and have a girls week...but sarah's not here...right? or does she come back next week??? :( i'll cross my fingers and hope that she is.  "Shall we go to bed?"
