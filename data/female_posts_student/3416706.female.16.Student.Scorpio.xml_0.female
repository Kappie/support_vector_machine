Well, first, let me explain. There is a boy at my school, a month or two younger than me, and my heart is falling for him. He seems so perfect to me, so like me, so good. But the problem is, he is a mormon. I could never marry a mormon, I disagree with their religion so much! They believe so much that is wrong.  Revelations 22:18 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book.  The book of mormon clearly violates this. And they believe we become A GOD after we die if we are good enough! It is so untrue. But then why is my heart telling me this? Why is it telling me my future could be here? With him? I am just so confused...   Love,  Sarah Confused little girl looking for the answer in God's Holy Word.
