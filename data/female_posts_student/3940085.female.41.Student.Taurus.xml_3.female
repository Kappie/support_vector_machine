I was raised the only girl in my family with three older brothers and spent most of my time alone. I did not share many of my thoughts with people because They just couldn't or wouldn't understand. I am a strong believer in angels and spirit guides leaving me as the "Freak" of my friends and family. I am also a Buffy The Vampire Slayer fan but I also consider Charmed and Tru Calling amongst my viewing pleasures.   I am a true horror fan with a soft spot for vampires and zombies. I find them to possess the dark parts of our human condition. The vampire needs blood to stay alive and represents sucking the life out of you. Who do you suck the life out of? Zombieseat human flesh and live on a basic animal drive of survival. Humans eat, breath, and sleep and we believe that this is our birth right. hell...you either understand or you don't.   I am a full time student and working for a BA in Criminal Justice. My favorit class was forensics and having to guess how long bodies have been dead. We studied like bullet holes, hangings, self inflicked gun shot wounds and stuff like that. Morbid yes....but it was really interesting.   Ok enough for now because I know you want to run and pretend you never read this. WHATEVER!
