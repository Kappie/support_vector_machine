Me, Jess and Britty were all at Brittany's house for our reunion party since she was back from Boston and we watched the game.  There was this one part of the game where there was this totally blatant penalty on somebody....i don't remember now.....but yeah and we sat there and yelled and screamed at the TV for seriously 3 mins straight.  And we started throwing stuff.  Jess threw 2 pillows, a pen and a stuffed animal.  I threw one pillow.  and Brittany just hollered and cussed at the tv.  Then finally, the stupid referee called the penalty and we shutup.  And then the last 3 mins of the game and the entire overtime period, me and jess sat there and yelled at the tv.  Jess is like "i've never seen you cuss this much before." and i was like "obviously you've never seen me at a Coppell vs. Jesuit game".  It was pretty funny.  Ok you know what bothers me?  People who come up to me (and sometimes Brittany) and say "Wow you must really like hockey because *they list all these really dumb reasons*.  You must be obsessed."  And i'm like "oook thanks for your concern".  Yes because i watch hockey games, have a fave player, know all the teams and some of their players, watch school hockey, have hockey in my away messages and profiles and me and some friends have dirty jokes that relate to hockey or inside jokes about hockey at all.....i must be obsessed.  Whatever.  I think its dumb that when you have a fave sport or fave something, people have to diss you for it and call you obsessed.  But then when they have a fave something that they really enjoy....they must not be obsessed.  Psh, its incredibly stupid.  It especially irks me when PEOPLE WHO PLAY THE SPORT tell me that i'm obsessed and that i know too much.  And i'm always like, shouldn't you have more passion than me for that sport because YOU FRICKIN PLAY IT????  Argh, anyways.  Yeah, if you wanna call me obsessed with hockey?  Fine, great, whatever.  Because i've got about 20 other friends who are exactly like me so who frickin cares.  lol, now that i've let off some steam........  Yesterday me, Britt and Jess went to the Vista Ridge mall and it was pretty awesome.  i didn't buy anything, i was proud of myself.  We saw the movie "Cheaper by the Dozen" which was a really funny movie.  And we saw the previews for a hockey movie called "Miracle" which is about the 1980 Olympic USA hockey team who beat the Soviets when no one thought they would.  Lots of hot guys are going to be in it, as we've observed from the previews.  We've decided we're going to see it opening day when it comes out in February.  bye now!  Love,  ~~~Taylor~~~
