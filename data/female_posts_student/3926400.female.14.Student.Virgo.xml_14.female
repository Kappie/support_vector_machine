(I love being mean) We can't have everyone writing - ( then there would be no one left to read )  lol.  I think that we should maybe vote on people... Okay, so lets get some rules here:  [rules are subject to editing] 1. Member should post once a week. 2. Play nice.  [doesn't mean no cussing - just keep it professional] 3. Individual will not be invited if there is a problem with a current member (IE: if they just don't get along)  4. If two members don't get along - a vote will be held - one might get booted.  ... (this is starting to sound fun...) lol 5. Let's try and invite someone who brings positive energy to the group.  6. Let's invite people that will actually  write .  (I don't know about Jill, but I don't want to go through the trouble of sending them an invite only to have them be quite and never write anything.)  That's all I can think of.  eh.  (don't post a new entry to comment (let's actually use the comments below :P)
