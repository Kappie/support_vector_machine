My roommate, who means well, suggested I take a walk earlier and get some fresh air, but I only succeed in sneezing my way up and down the streets of New York, insulting New Yorkers with my sickness invading their space.  I bought some coffee, which brought a temporary relief to my sore throat, but not to my sneezes, so on my way home I'm sure I managed to alienate those few friendly New Yorkers still in existence out there.    I finally broke down and bought the drugs though, so at least my cold should be a little more bearable now.  Somehow, the cold made the trek up to my head quite suddenly, without my knowing it.  I can handle the hacking coughs, but once it reaches my sinuses, I need drugs to clear my head.  And so I went to Duane Reade to get some.  I spent a small fortune, but I think it was worth it.  Hopefully, the end of this cold is near, and it will die a horrible quick death really soon and just leave me all alone again.    Unfortunately, my day was not very productive.  But I got a lot of rest, so hopefully that will help, and tomorrow I can begin to function like a normal human again.
