"why are you still here?"-me. "...uh...cuz i live here...?"-austin, talking to me like i'm retarded.  oh i also watched some monty python with my dad yesterday...wow best joke/quote ever:  "american beer is like making love in a canoe."-man #1 "how?"-man #2 "they're both fucking close to water."-man #1  ahahaha. woooooot.  got woken up at 10:30 today... there are these guys with big trucks outside my house and they're making as much noise as possible. fucking losers/assholes.  not doing anything today...my brother's at summer school. sucka. i think i'll just stay on msn the whole day, minus bathroom/food breaks.  well i'm out.  you sing the words, but still don't know what they mean.  kayte.
