December 8-9, 14 (Monday-Tuesday, Sunday): No-class days. December 10-13, 15-16 (Wednesday-Saturday, Monday-Tuesday): Fall semester final examinations, except in the School of Law.  Does anyone else find this schedule to be a bit, oh...odd? So, I graduate on December 5th, from the College of Liberal Arts, effectively ending my college career. (pre-Graduate school, anyway). Then I take final exams for this semester five days later...?  That's like saying, "Ok...here's your degree! Great job! Ok, now that you're through, would you mind taking these final exams, please?"  For argument's sake, I am well aware that I don't receive the actual degree on Dec. 5th--it won't be confered until the 20th, which means I won't actually have it in my hands until January. Still...something tells me that it will feel monumentally odd walking into a final exam 5 days after I've (supposedly) graduated. Somehow, doesn't sit very right with me.
