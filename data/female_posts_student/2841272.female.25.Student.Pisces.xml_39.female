The Hollywood serial-killer thriller genre has been so overworked in the movies that it is all but worn out, and audiences(myself included) appear to be losing all patience with it -- witness the devastating reception that both this movie(just under 28 million) and Ashley Judd's   Twisted  (just under 25 million) received.  At first,   Taking Lives   seems to be just what the doctor ordered to breathe some new life into a depleted genre: it has a new location(Montreal), an innovative visual style, and a fresh idea or two, or so it would seem. It's about a Canadian serial killer who we see launch his career at age 16 in a 1983 prologue, and then (via a clever title sequence) continue it over a 20-year spree in which he not only takes the lives of these young men, but also briefly assumes their identities. When we first meet FBI special agent Illeana Scott (Angelina Jolie), she's lying in a grave. More precisely, she's lying in a Montreal construction site where a serial killer dumped his recent victim, who was horribly disfigured. Illeana is an unorthodox detective who works instinctively and is not well received by local police.  But, agonizingly, it all falls apart, and it is not a coincidence that this all happens once Ethan Hawke makes his first appearence. The audience ends up figuring out the mystery long before the script intended, several intriguing elements of the plot never add up and much of what seemed so different was really only the same old cliches in disguise.    Taking Lives    isn't just a movie title, it's a declaration. Those who fall prey to its marketing campaign will lose nearly two hours of their lives to an unimaginative, and utterly disappointing thriller that is just attempting to pirate ideas from David Fincher's   Seven  , like a cinematic theif who attempted to pick someones pocket but only came up with lint.   Grade:  D-   Nick Jensen
