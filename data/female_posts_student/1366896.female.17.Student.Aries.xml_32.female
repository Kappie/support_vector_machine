You helped me keep smiling, When I was sad.   You helped me with guys. (n/a) You made me stay strong. How will I live, When you are gone?  And where the years take us, No place is too far, We will think of each other, Wherever we are.   You're a wonderful person, With a good heart to lend, And I want you to know, You're a really good friend.  When the whole world looks down on you, Remember you always have 4s2 :)
