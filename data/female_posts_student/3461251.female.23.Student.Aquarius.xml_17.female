I'm so happy yet a huge part of me is completely scared.  I'm sure has the days go by and I get closer to this actually happening alot of thoughs will be going through this head of mine.    However, for now I need to make a list of things to do in the next 3 to 4 weeks before surgery.  Clean house   Finish laundry   Wash all bedding, blankets, and sheets.   Pile up on groceries such has -- Carnation Instant Breakfast, Sugar Free Jell-O, Sugar Free Pudding, Sugar Free Popsicles.   Buy water!   Buy Vitamins with minerals.   Buy some hospital sleep wear!   Write letters to my family and friends!   Update my e-mail addresses.   Gather phone numbers.   That's all I can think of for now but I'm sure has time goes by there will be more things to add!!   I have so much to do and so little time to do it in.  I also have to decide whether to tell my grandmother the date of surgery or wait and call her afterwords.  I don't want to worry her and I don't want her out in this crazy winter weather driving back and fourth from Michigan to Tennessee.  Any way, I must get to bed! Today is mom's birthday, I should be awake in the morning to go do something with her for the day.
