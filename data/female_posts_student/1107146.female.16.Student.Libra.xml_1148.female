I know he won't be onlne, but I'm still all, well, maybe he'll be there.  Whatever.  I didn't get your e-mail.  It wasn't there, so you'll have to resend it, or just print it off so I can look at it tomorrow.  Does anyone know what my english homework was?  I'm thinkin not, but its still worth a try.  Um...yup.  Peace out once again.
