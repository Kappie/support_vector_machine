So I had 20 minutes to get dressed, to my hair and makeup and get out the door. So I didn't have time to shower, but I didn't smell too bad. Haha. Then I got in the car and was doing my makeup, when I spilled liquid foundation all over the seats and on my pants. It came out of the seat and most of it off my pants when I got to school and washed it off. So things weren't as bad as I thought they'd be. Today was a nice day, in fact. It just was. Nothing pivotal happened, it was just a nice day.  If you haven't heard the acoustic version of "Come Back to Bed" by John Mayer, I suggest you do it. What a beautiful song. OMG. On the "Heavier Things" album, it sounds country western and I hate it, but plain acoustics, it's gorgeous. This is the 4th time in a row I've listened to it.  And Sarah said she'll introduce me to some of Brandon's friends, which I'm looking forward too. ;-)  Make that the 6th time I've listened to it.
