My school is a real POS but the other school i was going to go to i hear was even worse. the thing better about sandcreek then Falcon is that sandcreek has my friends to make the shitty school better. Now Pinecreek. My cousins all went there and I was going to go there but i moved out of my aunts house. If i had my way about the whole thing i would go ther but i dont so . thanks "tim" comment accepted and hey u gave me something to write about.
