Even though I might only speak with a patient for a few moments or help out on a X-Ray, CAT Scan, or MRI exam on them that only takes a short time, I can still use that small amount of time for a lot of things.  I can use that time to comfort a patient, I can use that time to reassure a patient, I can use that time to relate to that patient's concerns or medical problems on a more personal level if possible, I can make a patient laugh when he or she feels anxious or uncomfortable, I can answer a patient's questions, and, most importantly, I can listen.  I remember one time I assisted in a Lumbar Puncture back in Fluoroscopy.  My job?  To hold the patient's hand.  I realize that I wasn't really doing anything, but I still felt like I was doing something important.  It didn't really matter that my ankles and feet got the shit fluoroed out of them (the fluoro tube is on the floor, and I was standing next to it).  I think what all this leads to is the epiphany that I am a humanitarian.  Some people might disagree, saying that I'm crude and dont care about others, but I feel I need to contest that.  My reasoning?  I don't like to see people suffer.  I don't like to see people hurt.  Inversely, people don't like to suffer and they don't like to be hurt.  And that's why I think the medical profession is right for me.  I see patients with terminal cancer.  I see patients with badly broken bones that need painful surgery.  I see patients on respirators hanging on dearly for their lives.  Yes, this deeply upsets me to see any human being in such shape, but, i know I can at least try to make a difference.  I know I will have accomplished something great in my life.  And thats why this X-Ray kid loves her job.  "A light heart carries you through all the hard times"      -Fortune Cookie
