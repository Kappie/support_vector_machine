I do not even know if Robbie has his car back or yet :-\. If Jen cannot get ahold of him I have no idea how I am supposed to lol. I really need to store her phone number in my phone so that I stop getting so confused when she calls me. I think she is the "Jm" in my phone that I forgot who it was. lol, too bad I have no idea what her last name is. She is wicked cool people though.  Anways, it was either to wait for her call...or find people who were around now to go spend the day/evening with. So far, I have found a few people...I guess they were actually waiting for me to call since they were not sure when I would be back from SATs (which sucked really bad, by the way. The math section on this one sucked. I am nowhere near as confident on this one as I had been in Windsor Locks). So, maybe we'll chill for the day and if Jen calls me the night will be reserved for them.   I need to survive on $15. Crap. Not good. I need a job which barely requires for me to be there.   Maybe I will only buy a colatta this afternoon and I will pay for it in change giving me the illusion that I saved money lol.   Meh, I have about 15-20 minutes before I have to head out on my walk to meet them. I was going to try to make myself reorganize my room some more. It is not going to be done until we have that tag sale, because there is too much stuff in my room and I hate the clutter like that. I would so much prefer if it were barren.   I could have sworn that there was more that I wished to write in. :-\ Poo.  Anyways, question:    Who have I actually told from LiveJournal that I moved here? Please comment just so that I know. I know about four poeple who read this for sure but I just want to check. Thanks muchly!    That works for that anyways. Arg, I know that there is something that I am forgetting.  ::checks handy-dandy planner, crosses out yesterday, for it is one more day survived::   Well, there is nothing listed. I have no idea. I think that I was supposed to call my mom though. Whoops. There is always tomorrow.   Okay, well, it is nearing time for me to head out. I shall talk to y'all later.   Tycho, I hope you are having fun camping! Sorry about my sleeping last night!   -J9
