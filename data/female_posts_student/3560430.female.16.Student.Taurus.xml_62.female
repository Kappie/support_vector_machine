Laurell K Hamilton hasn't updated her blog! Sigh I swear I'm not sad.   Well I finally went to go see Harry P3. It was really really good. But I can't help but sit there and go AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. Yes they left out MAJORE parts. I was prepared for the absence of the second quiddich match, heck I sat there and preped myself for it. I said to myself "You WILL NOT pick apart what is probably a wonderful movie for the lack of one scene, it is probably a woinderful movie and should be seen and appriciated for it's artistic merit." And I didn't I really did like the movie, and aside from the absence of the quiddich scene I had no complaints... Well one. They left out the scene where    *SPOILER ALERT! IF YOU ONLY WATCH THE, I.E. YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOKS, YOU MAY  LEARN MORE THAN YOU WISH TO KNOW*     Harry learns that Peter, Sirius,  and  his father were  all  animugi. It was a really good p[art and I don't think Harry will learn about it until the fourth book. It'll really suck, I feel very bad about it. But chin up and all that. You know that wasn't the only part they left out, it was just the little thing that really got my goat.                                     *SPOILER ALERT OFF*   I love movies, they're great and I think in time I'll get over the loss of thes wonderful scenes. Well Let me end by saying that this post is probably very pointless, and that I really miss Bethany.   Next post tune in to hear why I hate movie talkers... Unless they are me...  Don't you just love double standards!
