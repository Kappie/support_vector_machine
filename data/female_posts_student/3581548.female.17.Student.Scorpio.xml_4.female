But shortly after that..me and michelle went running around to look for Sam a gift for their 4 month anniversary. yeeehaw`! not. but Shan came to the mall and is stayin the nite with me 2nite.  Me and Shan went to Winifrede. It waasn't exactly our kind of fun...but we made the best out of it.  I have a huge problem..i'm starting to like someone that i shouldn't.My sister would  kill  me`! She said he "got around" but i don't thnk she knows the story that i know. and that would probably change her view of him. but gosh, why me? i mean, it's not like i could get him anyways. But it's worth a shot...
