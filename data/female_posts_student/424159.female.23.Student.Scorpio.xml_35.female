I opened my blinds all the way and admired the rain.    I never used to, but now I love the rain.  I've come to the conclusion that the reasoning behind this is that it reminds me of Orlando.  It reminds me of lunch time with my best friends at school, under the cement courtyard roof.  It reminds me of trips to certain places with certain people.  It reminds me of a vibe I felt only in Orlando.  It reminds me that I'm alive.  It doesn't really rain too often in Ohio.  It rained alot in Orlando.  Maybe that's why I feel so depressed living in Ohio now.  God I wish it would rain everyday.  I think rain is one of the most beautiful elements (if it's even considered an element).  I actually find my fascination with rain to make perfect sense, because my Zodiac Sign, the Scorpion, is a water element.  Shit.  It stopped raining.  Dammit!
