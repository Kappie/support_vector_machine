Please forgive me for not being there when you left. Please forgive me for not letting you open up to me until its too late. Please forgive me for not being a perfect grand daughter that you've always wanted. Please forgive me for not walking the path that you've choosen for me. I was one of a kind, hard headed, selfish, stubborn, stuck up, took everybody's words for granted. I'm sorry for what I did and I'm sorry for putting everyone's into a headache situation with me as well.   If another life really exixt, I wish that we come from the same family again. I'm sure your in a better place now. I know that your looking down and smiling at every single one of us. I just want you to know that you dont have to worry about this grand daughter. Because I'm strong and I can take good care of myself. There are things that I dont know and still dont understand as of now. But i'm not expecting an answer from you. Better yet please visit me in my dreams like you used to.   I will try to pray and leave food out for you ever now and then. But grams will you please help me with luck? Let me win big on them scratchers or let me hit the jackpot for once :). Please pretty please. Thanks grams, I miss you.
