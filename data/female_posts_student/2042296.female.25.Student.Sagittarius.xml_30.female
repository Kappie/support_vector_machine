On Thursday evening, as we were lying in bed with Rico, under the same blanket, I said that my head hurts. I didn't take anything chemical, I thought, maybe I could sleep it away. Well, we have this habit of talking about things before we fall asleep (or end up making love ;) and this we did also on Thu. We talked, touched, gave kisses, Rico stroke my hair and my whole skin and after a while he asked, if I still have headaches. They were gone. What I had, instead, was a wonderfully secure feeling, I was comfortable and surrounded by love.   I know I'm marrying the right man.  I took some photos of our beautiful cats yesterday, have a look:   urlLink http://irc-galleria.net/view.php?nick=sassy_=2853984=true    urlLink http://irc-galleria.net/view.php?nick=sassy_=2853976=true   I'm yearning for finnish poetry. Gotta bring my books here in August.   It's raining, I wanna meet my man in our living room.
