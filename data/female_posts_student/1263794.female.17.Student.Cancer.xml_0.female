The walkout was awesome! Anyone who didn't go really missed out. I was hestitant at first but it turned out I really got into it. I really surprised myself. And my little group even got to meet the Lieutenant governer Beverly Perdue, we got to give her a flyer! We also got to go into Marc Basnight's office, (the president pro-tempore of the senate) his secretary was there but he wasn't. O well it was still really cool. We just had a test on them too so it was really cool actually getting to see them. It's weird because they seem more like names then just real people. Who woulda knew?! Well it turned out that Raleigh Charter was actually the majority there by far. I think Broughton and Enloe people got suspended if they went, so I know that played a big part in the turnout. I'm actually really appreciative of RCHS right now. This was my first real protest and I think it was a really good experience, and I'd love to do something like that again. I never really used to think twice about protests, but I know I will now. It's weird how one event can really change your outlook on things. Well I'm definitely more anti-war now then ever. It was so cool seeing everyone with similar ideas going out and really working towards what they believe in. I used to think protestors that go out and get arrested are just stupid, but I really have a whole new opinion of them now. It takes guts.
