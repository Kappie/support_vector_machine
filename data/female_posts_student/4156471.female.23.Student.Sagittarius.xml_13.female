Accomadations  : 4 bedroom apartment in dormitories across the street from the Uni and the sports centre. Met one girl Ola who is moving out. Michal, will be staying on but I haven't met her yet. One bedroom is empty (will stay that way?) Unfortunately there is no oven in my little place thus all my photocopied recepies could have stayed home. There is a gas stovetop that you have to light with matches (scary). I'll be sticking with cold foods for now. There is a mini gorcery stoe, laundry, computer labs,study rooms and pub all in this complex. My bedroom is very comfortable and will be more so when I invest in a pillow.       So what have I been doing?  When I told various airport workers that I as moving on to El Al they rolls their eyes "oymygod you'll be waiting in 4 hours lines". But when I got to israeli security it was really fun. She asked me all about my life.. why I ws going to israel how I learned hebrew. my shule, my parent's hebrew names it was hard core but she was really really nice. Flight was fine.. finally saw my first shrek (the 2nd one) and mean girls. and listened to onflight radio CUZ THEY WOULD NOT LET US LISTEN TO CDS ON THE !0 HOUR FLIGHT. but it eventually ended and I arrived. Was met by the madrichim Hadguy and Lilach and the supervising prof Mark Gelber. I am considered a MAPMES student while the madrichim were really there for the benefit of OSP students. They have all paid for extra trip's and stuff. Yesterday we toured the campus, ate pizza lunch and chilled out. Today I went for a hike with the OSP kids at a Wadi.. Avrut I think. Saw gazelles and waterfall ad had interesting talks. yumy yummy sandwhiches for lunch. After we went to Sde Boker, saw Ben Gurion's grave. IT's cool cuz Hadgui/Hagui (can't remember which) and MArk Gelber have opposing political views on israel's environmental/ social policies so its nice to hear the debate going.       Me  : I"m super jet lagged and my right ear feels like its getting infected. was a bit overwhelmed yesterday but now that I have toilet paper, bought water hummous and pita, emptied the fly covered garbage left by absent roomates, and money.. I feel good. Tommorw I will be adventurous and go walk to find the big superstores that Gelber pointed out on the bus ride home. I also can't wiat for the library to open.. you see, everythign is closed for shabbas so I don't know what is or isn't open. Also I hear that there is Rikudiyah tommorow (israeli dancning) WOO HOO!     Contact :  Shortly I will be recieving an 800 number that makes it free for anyone in Canada to contact me. The only charges are for minutes on my end (damned cellphones). I also found this faux msn thing so I will try to get on msn once in a while. The time difference in 7 hours ahead of Canada and I guess only 2 or three ahead of England..    c'est tout,    love, Steph
