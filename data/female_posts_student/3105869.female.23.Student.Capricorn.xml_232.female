First of all, we are all okay.  Kris, I'm sure Todd has already emailed you, and/or called, but he is fine, he was in the back of the casino killing time with M. while C. and I were in the bldg on the left.       Nobody freak out.  Okay so theres a bldg the left, and these are all attached, they sort of grow out of each other, the bldg on the left housed a clothing store on the bottom.  In the videos and pictures its the glass you can see in the background kinda between the tables and the umbrellas.  The bldg on the right is called casino royal, in the middle is a cafe with nice looking umbrellas and rattan chairs wrapped around metal frames.  Also the street this is all sitting on is a pedestrian only thoroughfare, the place where the car was, was to the right of casino royal there was a small sort of service access street, I think it must be used for food and drink delivery and have a worker's entrance there.     We had dragged the guys around all day long, we were all tired anyway, but C. needed to shop for a couple things before we left that day, so we decided divide and conquer the guys to the casino, the girls to the store, meet in the middle outside.  We never got to that point, we thought initially it was a massive gun that had gone off and only sounded so loud because of the nature of the walled in with bldgs street and cobble foot way in the center, we thought this had made it amplified.  C. did think it was a bomb.  I yelled at her to get down behind the counter and tried to get the women standing at the door to lock it but they only locked the right door, so that really defeated the purpose. When we saw they weren't locking both doors, I turned and yelled at C. to get to the back and hide, I didn't know what what happening all I thought was that someone would come in and shoot the place up. We waited until it was quiet, but this stupid woman goes outside to get pictures, such a sensationalist, she got pictures of the guy with the head wound.  I wanted to punch her.   We walked outside to go into the casino, by way of walking next to the cafe, a scene I just cannot explain but would like to forget.  We got inside a couple of the people who had been at the cafe, sitting outside were inside the entry way, I recognized the little girl who looked like curly sue she had been outside standing next to the table alone screaming while people ran around the man who had been at her table.  Anyway so we walk up the stairs but in the heat and after seeing the effect of the explosion on people and the blood I started to faint and had to grab the handrail.  We got to the top and couldn't find the guys so I finally started crying, uncontrollably, and the woman at the bar gave us water.  We sat down, but in a moment of clarity we realized this was not a safe place to have a glass of water in, no matter how sick we felt, so we walked downstairs, I was still in hysterics and walk to the door in time to see the guy who was really hurt being lifted onto a stretcher, we stopped in place and hugged each other and covered our eyes until it was over then walked cautiously outside and saw the guys.  They had been in the back, whereas we were at the window and downstairs when it happened, so the guys never really saw or knew what was going on and M. couldn't seem to understand why we were hysterical and shaking, he even said we didn't have to go, but both C. and I said yes we did.  I couldn't eat more than rice cakes after that and I didn't sleep last night.  But none of us were hurt, thank God.
