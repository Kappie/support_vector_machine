I've been sick from the food every day since gettnig to Volgograd, my roommate gets up a 4:30 in the morning (after coming in after midnight) and makes lots of noise, and we are dependent on a huge bus to take us around and all the girls want to stop to shop on the way home every day.  Dad just sent me pictures of the pups so now I'm even more homesick.  Tonight I got to go to the Russian firestation adn sit in teh fire truck wearing a helmit with the sirens going. It was pretty cool. There will be pictures up as soon as I get back!  Dosvidaniya!  D
