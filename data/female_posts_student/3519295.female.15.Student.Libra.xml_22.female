(don't ask.)    based on cars:  nate by a long shot. all three have trucks, but frankie's is a 2004 Ford F150, drew's is a 2002 Nissan (TINY), and nate's is a: 1956 classic navy blue hot-hot-hot ford truck which he redid himself. (so hot)   on looks:  Nathan again. he is so hot. drew's(6foot) really tan, but so is nate now (lifeguarding and all), and frankie's(6 foot 2) a "tall, skinny, ugly swimmer" according to my friend leeza-bee, but he isn't ugly. nate is 6 foot 6! ( :O ), he's super muscley, but not too buff, has curly blonde-brown hair, and blue-green eyes, and a really nice chin.   personality:  frankie. nate is obsessed w/ sex, booze, and chicks. drew is a little less outgoing than i usually like in my dudes, and is kinda serious. frankie is smart, sarcastic, funny, but has a really narrow minded view on some things. he can take a joke, but is really flirty, although his and my relationship is different because we hang out a lot and he talks to me way more than other chicks.  the winner is obviously Texas Dan...or Emilio Estevez.  well, i'm bored of writing now.  i'm leaving for San Antonio tomorrow. Yippee. best case scenario: i see texas dan and we fall madly in love, and become pen pals til we both go to the same college.  worst case: i am eaten by a cactus-monster and don't get to find out if frankie and i ever get together.  or i break my legs climbing on the alamo or fall off the hotel room balcony and can't renew my Kerr McGee swim contract.  liebe, katja  hey, how did you find my blog thing anyway? was i right about the swim team?
