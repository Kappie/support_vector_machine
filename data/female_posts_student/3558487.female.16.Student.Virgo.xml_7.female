Like, sure, i'm good at it for my school, but i don't seem to be anywhere else. Does this mean that i'm just not meant to play flute.. cuz i really love doing it. I guess i'll just have to try hard this year.   I took a long nap today and it felt really good, usually i just feel worse when i wake up, but i def. needed this nap today.   Oh yeah, i got yelled at by mason for the first time as section leader today... well, it wasn't me personally being yelled at... but it was exciting! You know, the usual "flutes aren't counting loud enough" and something else... hehe...   -Lisa  Song: "Do You Realise" - The Flaming Lips
