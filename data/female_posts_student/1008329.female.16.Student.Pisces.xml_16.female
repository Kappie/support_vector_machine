So I suppose people are out having fun. Guess what I did? I CLEANED MY ROOM! wOoHoO. Mi madre thought it was too cluttered so she made me clean it. I must say, it looks much better. Normally I pile my stuff on my bed. That is the most common place. I have a big bed and I only use half of it, so on the other half there are always binders of homework, the next day's outfit, etc.  Some of you are thinking: WHAT?! UR ROOM IS NEVER MESSY WHEN I COME OVER!..WeLL duh. I clean it. Oh it is so sad: When the cleaning lady comes, she completely ignores my room b/c it is messy. Hehe. Not anymore. Anyway.. Why do I talk about the most boring of things (messy rooms)? No clue. Does anyone know? Probably not.   Some people have been asking me about "doG". Well, don't worry about it.    CDs wanted:  U2: U2's greatest hits Queen: Queens Greatest Hits Nirvana: Nevermind, Insecticide The Donnas: The Donnas Spend the Night Kacey Chambers: single-Not Pretty Enough The Vines latest SLayter Kinney's latest Maybe: chevelle and the used...humm maybe! Also I want to check out The Ataris.. -I heard from Wick that The Vines latest CD is bad...Oh, I also want to go to the NOT SO SILENT NIGHT CONCERT @ the HP Pavilion in S.F. (tHE Cit-AY).  -*If you would like to contribute to my CD collection by buying these as a present..feel free. I would  love  you.....*-   When the lights go down in the city(OoOhOh)And the sun shines on the bay. Do I wanna be there in my city?(OoOoHOh) Whoaaa. whoaaa. whoaaaaaaooo. -Journey   What else to say? November is a great month. Mi madre's birthday is Nov. 30. November issue of the school paper is coming out soon. I have three articles in this month's. I think. I wrote three anyway. I like high school a lot better than other things. Except my math teacher. I really think she needs to get some new teaching methods. She gets her point across, but she is very droning.  She sits at the front of the classroom, writing on the whiteboard, showing us how to solve all the problems on the night-before homework. We have block scheduling so every class except on Mondays are two hours long. :-P So she has time to do that.   It seems like this day is dragging on and on.   I was just surfing the net when I came upon this website of a person. The person has some really good quotes on their webpage and express good political and social views.  IT was amazing, and made me think. I shouldn't waste this space with mindless chatter. It should be interesting. My friends are starting to call me a hippie b/c I'm against the war. Not "hippie" in a bad, put-down sort of way. If they were my opinions of Bush would still remain.  I went to this antiwar rally in the city. It really opened my eyes. There were nude people protesting, pot everywhere and hairy/stinky people all around. ((kinda sounds like a concert..)) Some people dedicate their lives to such important matters. Unimportant matters still surround me everyday though. I go to high school and what other people think about whom and what is the best way to do this/that/etc is the topic of most any conversation. I get tired of it. People need to look past their pathetic little home lives and to the world. I don't think a lot of kids my age get that if we don't do anything to help what's right, we're going to reel in the benefits of an unhappy place. This is our future. We need to act upon it. Stop worrying about what you look like, and who you think is talking about you. Others are a lot off worse than you. And in the end, it really doesn't matter what happened in high school. High school is just the beginning of a long life. High school is the shooting point of which you make ur decisions of what you want to do in life. It should not be the highlight of your life, it should be a time just like any other where you cherish the memories but not to the point where those are all your memories. After high school you have college. Or maybe you don't. Life without college will be pretty hard to come by, but that is a choice that all people make. I'm not going to lecture you on going to college, that is your own choice. As for me, I want to be educated. It's just like when I first started playing the guitar and Peter was teaching me up strokes. Not all music says that you need to stroke up so I was to understand eventually with enough playing, you(the player) will be able to just know by sound and experience whether to stroke up or down. And he's right. It's very simple to listen to music now and figure whether it's an up or down stroke. I want it to be that way in life. I want it to be that way for me. If you want it you can have it too.    Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.. -Smashing Pumpkins
