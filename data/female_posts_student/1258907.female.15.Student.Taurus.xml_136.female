I dont care, its easy to pretend that your not there It doesnt bother me, you immaturity What bothers me is How you blame me for your insecurity Between your lips, all you can mumble is lies Your completely oblivious To your own disguise You dont seem to realize Gods love for you How Jesus died on the cross, you cant construe So you turn to something false  higher than you are Then you blame me for your religious troubles To me this is completely bizarre Between your lips, you mumbles lies about me Words crashing, like falling debris Who is what and why and how We dont agree Its like your hatred Is growing on a tree And still, you dont see That I dont like you either.
