WOO HOO C/O 2004 baby!!!!! i am a band geek...... i write.... a lot...... i am in love... though that is a complicated story in itself.... i dont recommend it unless you actually have a chance with that person.... i have made the mistake numerous times though this is the first i can call it love.... it has left me so lost and confused but so has a lot of stuff.... part of it is inexperience and part is how hard i fell so fast..... but it is safe to say next year will be quite interesting.... just another chapter in my life
