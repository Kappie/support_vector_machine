I try not to stress over things, esspecially things that are optional and that I don't *need* to do. I updated the links, but nobody usually notices when I do that. I did type one update, but internet explorer crashed and I wasn't about to type the whole thing up all over again.  I went on the vacation thing, but it wasn't a cruise, it was an island with a resort on it. I relaxed alot. I took sailboat lessons... and went on a nature thing with my sister and dad. Overall, the place was a ripoff. I found the small things were better then the resort itself. Buying pop tarts was one of the many highlights of the trip. I never get pop tarts. Maybe because they really don't taste that great once you actaully eat them.. but just the fact that I went and did something unusual makes me feel warm inside. I wrote on my book and played Final Fantasy Tactics alot. I hung with my cousins. I think overall though, the best part of the trip was getting back home. That was the most exciting part.  I'm going to the beach this weekend with some friends of mine. You know who you all are.  Okay, bye bye.
