All the actors voices were amazing. I rate this movie a A-.    urlLink  The Core    (Aaron Eckhart, Hilary Swank, Delroy Lindo, Bruce Greenwood and Stanley Tucci)  This movie was good but it didn't seem real. It is not possible for people to go to the core the earth and survive. It was still an interesting movie to watch. I give this one a C.    urlLink  The Hunted     (Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro)  Great movie with a lot of action. It also has a great fighting scene at towards the end of the movie. The movie does seem to have a lot of blood in it. I give this one a B-.    urlLink  The Master of Disguise     (Dana Carvey, Jennifer Esposito and James Brolin)  This movie really sucked! I was hoping it would have been good. Dana Carvey did I much better job in Wayne's World. Anyways I am giving this one a D.    urlLink  Bowling for Columbine     (Michael Moore, Marilyn Manson and Charlton Heston)  This is the best documentary that i have ever seen. Michael Moore is on a mission to find out why in the US is there so many murders. Michael says that over  11 000  people died in the US each year because of guns and murder. He wants to know why? His answer to this is because the media makes people so scared of other people. In this movie Michael comes to Canada to see how things work here. He found out that only about  200  people died each year in Canada because of guns and murder. He has seen that people here in Canada have no fear of people killing each other. There is about 10 million people in Canada and 7 million people own guns. It amazes him that Canada has such a low murder rate when 7 million people own guns. I think everyone should watch this movie. If you can handle the emotional parts of the movie you should rent it sometime. I even had tears in my eyes. This movie is shocking and sad at parts but it makes you see the reality of life in the US. I rate this movie an A+++.    urlLink  The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King     (Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Lan McKellen, Viggo Mortensen and John Rhys-Davies)  Well it is Lord of the Rings and other other movies were exellent so this one was also excellent. I rated this one a A++.    urlLink  Bringing Down The House      (Queen Latifah, Steve Martin and Eugene Levy)  This was an ok movie. I give this one a B+.    urlLink  Cheaper by the Dozen     (Steve Martin, Bonnie Hunt, Hilary Duff, Piper Perabo and Tom Welling)  It was a great movie and it was very funny. It will makes you laugh! I rated this one a A-.  Well that's all for now. If you want to leave a comment about any of these movies and what you though about them just click on Comments!
