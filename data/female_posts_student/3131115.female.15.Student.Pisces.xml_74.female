A reminder of what I'll never have   I'll never have...I'll never-   Standing so close knowing that it kills me to breathe you in   Standing so close knowing that it kills me to breathe you in.."   -From Autumn to Ashes-   I'm in a lot of pain now. Not only emotional pain, but physical too. I feel like I'm going to puke...and my head hurts. I keep swollowing, because I feel like there is puke coming into my mouth. Yesterday Bill continued to tell me that he did not want me to come to him house (today)..so, I made plans with my mom to go see my cousins. It's been about 3 years since I've talked to them last, I've always been angry at them for past reasons..but my mom says that they've changed and that they've been asking to see me. I do feel kind of bad because I never go and see my family anymore. So I decided to go with her today, and do something with my family for a change. I hate when Bill gets mad about this..I called him this morning and told him that I was going Of coarse, because I'm doing something without him..he got mad and wants me to go to his house. I told him that the only reason I did this was because he told me that he doesnt want me coming over..and in the process, he hung up on me.   Justin, for some reason called meon the phone lastnight..and it bothered me. He kept saying "son" and "pimp" and telling me that he's turning prep and all this other shit. I was trying to talk to him about something, something that I wanted him to understand and he did nothing but try to turn things around..and I was like.. "justin, stop assuming and just listen" and no matter what, he didnt understand and like everyone else just waited for his turn to talk..and didnt even care about anything I had to say..yet he tells me that he loves me. Grr...I hung up on him. Which I am now VERY thankful for, I can't deal with it anymore.    "I could be mean..   I could be angry..   you know i could be JUST LIKE YOU...   I could be fake..   I could be stupid..   you know i could be JUST LIKE YOU..."   -Three Days Grace-   Shit just sucks so bad. I talked to another guy (an old one) and he actually gave me hope for the future..something I never thought that I'd have again. His wife died in his arms. She was in labor..and had triplets, but died in the process. So this guy..has triplets, and I dont think he will ever take his children for granted..or anything in life for granted again. He told me that he re-lives the night that his wife died, every night before he sleeps. He said it was so hard, but it gets easier to manage...and it gave me some hope. I know I sound stupid..but by the end of our conversation..I was in tears.    "Will you still hold me when you see what I have done?   Will you still kiss me the same   when you taste my bitter pride..?"   -Atreyu-   Anyhow..My mom and I are going to pick Zachary up at 10:00. I'm really excited about watching him, but bill doesnt want to come. Grr..   "I was never good at hiding anything   My thoughts break me   Do you understand what you mean to me?   You are my faith.."      "WhenI sit and think of the days we shared   and the nights you covered for me   Every little thing that I ever did   you would stand by me   Every time you cried it would take my wind   My heart would break   if I could be strong like you were for me   YOU ARE MY FAITH!.."   -COLD-   I should probably start getting ready..butI can't stop listening to music. Sometimes I wish that I could be locked in a room-forever. Although, I just wish that I could have all the music that I love, and be able to listen to it as loud as I want..and have a very very nice stereo system in it..and have NOBODY able to hear me..and stay in there..forever, until I die. Then...in my little cell or whatever it was..With sound-proof walls and doors and such..in my "cell"...I know that I would be safe. I know..I'm stupid, but that is my   wish  .   I have to go get ready...
