In the movies, they try not to at least leak out that all now 8 shootings are connected.  If they do  have  evidence they are connected, try to keep it secret, so that it is not  magnified in the media and feed the culprits' ego.  Like when they said on camera that school should go on as usual, there is no indication that schools are targeted and them boom, a school kid got hit on the way to school.    Thanks Ching and Pia for the birthday greetings.  In 2 years I will be 50 and married 25 years. That means I would have been 50% single and 50% married all my life. So that eventually my married life will outnumber my single life so I am determined to make my married life fun, fullfilling and exciting ..........and that means Ric has to leave me alone from time to time.
