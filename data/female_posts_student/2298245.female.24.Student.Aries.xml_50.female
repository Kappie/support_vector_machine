Normally, movies used to be a much bigger part of my life, and I used to have seen everything - at the very least I wanted to see it and was barred from doing so by virtue of living in Mississippi.  Ironically, I had to come to New York to lose touch with film.  I've seen a few of these movies, and there are a few more that I want to see.  And I've heard of most of them, so I suppose that is an encouraging sign.
