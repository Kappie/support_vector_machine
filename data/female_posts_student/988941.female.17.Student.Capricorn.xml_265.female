Good luck with the swimming, I am sure you will do fine!  What are you guys and gals gonna do when we leave year 11? Are you going to stay here? Go somwhere else? Stay at homwe for the rest of your life and wallow in self pity? Or are you guys gonna go out there and get a well paid job.? I'm staying at warlingham 6th form cause i know what i want to do and im hoping to pass and then go to uni ! HEHE get away from home and all tghe pressures from your family dont you think?  I have been accpeted at the sixth form which I am happy about. I am not sure about uni and stuff, haven't looked into it. I may be getting a job soon but we'll have to wait and see. I would like to go to uni, you get more qualifications and therefore a better or higher paid job. Yea it is good to get away from family pressures but I'd stil miss em!!!!
