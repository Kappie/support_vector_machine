The drama party is tonight and I want to drive myself there. It's at mat's dad's shop and its not like i've never been there before. I've just never driven there before.  not to mention, i have a freaking map!! BUT as i said i've never driven there before and its wet outside so the rents dont wanna let me drive myself. This is sooooo STUPID!!!!! I have a licence. LET ME USE IT!!!! if they dont let me drive now they're never gunna! that pisses me off so bad!
