So he sat around my house for 45 minutes until my brother came home..it was a little interesssttting.  So I finished cleaning then I read a REALLLY good book calle d "Rachels Tears" Its about the girl who was killed at columbine. It was really inspiring. I want to  live my live more like her. right now I am cooking some noodles because I am super HUNGY!  Tonight my mom cooked the best tasting spageti ever. I don't know how I will survive in  college without her yummy food.  Speaking of college..I CANT WAIT!!!!!! Tomorrow i am going to this thing for Dartmouth colege. I don't really want to go there btu I might as well check it out. I think I want to go somewhere in the east coast. I have wanted to go to University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill since I was like 7 (seriously!) So I might try to get a crew scholarship there. I am going to try a ton of places though. And see what ones i get into then make my decision. I can't wait for COLLLEGE! Yipppee!   Laura
