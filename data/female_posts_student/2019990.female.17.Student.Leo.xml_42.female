Yesterday I watched one surgery, and then did office work the rest of the day.  Today I observed seeing patients for half the day, and did office work for the other half, with the occasional urine analysis thrown in.  I think lab technician could be a cool job.  I did always like labs in Cheistry.  And I thing the urine analysis thing is pretty darn cool.  And it would also give me more time with my prospective family.   Today one of my aunts patients was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain, and it turns out she has a mass in her abdomen about the size of an orange.  So tomorrow they scheduled an emergency surgery, that one I think I'll observe.  It could be quite interesting.     So get this, I've sarted diagnosing people with what I think they're sick with.  How wierd am I.  I diagnosed a guy at the airport with Parkinsens(I dont know how to spell it.) and one of the drug reps with an eating disorer. (you could see her muscle fibres through her skin.  It was sick.)     But I have to get going, we're going on an evening outing, to get our drycleaning, ice cream, and to drop one of Dan's friends at home. Talk to you all later.   Sorry I missed the "scholarship pageant" meeting last night.  Oh wait I have no talent!  Never mind.  Love/Miss you all.  See you in four days.
