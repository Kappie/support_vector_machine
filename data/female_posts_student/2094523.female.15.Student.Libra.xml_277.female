If you gathered all the tears you've cried in your lifetime, it will form an ocean...more than an ocean, it will drown us in our own misery. And once we self suffocate ourselves we open our eyes and see clearly.. one tear is nothing, crying won't change the fucked up world, we've cried all the tears we could.. we're finally done...though it takes us a life time to realize this.. we die smiling. because this is what life took all the time in our lives trying to teach us what to do.. to smile. We're another page in history.
