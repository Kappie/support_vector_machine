	 
      Now that it's too late,
I can't get you out of my head.
It's one of those things I hate,
like words I almost said.
I see your face in my sleep,
What do you really feel
way down deep?
I want to ask, I have to deal.
Too scared too know,
frustration and fear,
but if I finf the courage,
will you even hear?
