Well, sometimes, I just can't figure out that reason.I've been told that sometimes, it could take a long time before you ever do and I believe that's true b/c I have yet to figure out why some certain things have happened to me or any of my friends.   I still haven't heard from that certain guy that I talked about in my previous post. I don't know if I ever will, but I have a feeling that sooner or later, we're bound to run into each other and even if we don't want to, we'll have to confront each other about the situation. There's a part of me that is scared to death of when that time comes, but another part of me knows that I really need to talk to him. I realized a while back that I'm not going to be able to move on or start trying to get rid of my feelings for him until I talk to him face to face. I just need to hear him out and talk things through.I can't tell you exactly how I'll react when I see him, but I know it's going to be one of the most difficult things I'll ever have to do.  Now, one of my best friends is having trouble w/ her love life. I won't mention her name b/c I don't know if she wants everyone to know. Anyway, she has loved this guy for as long as she can remember and in my opinion, he feels the exact same way about her. She's told me numerous times about how much she cares about him and how she wishes they were more and I keep telling her the same thing. I tell her that she needs to let him know and tell him right now. If she doesn't, then she'll go the rest of her life wondering what might have been if she had told him and regretting it. I know that my situation didn't exactly turn out the way I had hoped, but that doesn't mean that her's won't. And I'm almost certain that if she did tell him the truth about how she felt, she would get her wish. I mean, you can tell just by the way they look at each other or act around each other that they really care for one another. You don't see that very often. Now she's found out that someone else likes him and that he just might like that someone as well. I told her he might just be telling her that he likes her too just to see what her reaction will be...see if she gets jealous about it b/c that's what he wants. But, if he does like this other girl, then she (my friend) needs to tell him now how she feels or it could be too late. I want more than anything for her and this guy to finally get together b/c the way I see it...they're meant for each other. It's true that if they are meant for each other, then they'll end up getting together on down the road, but sometimes you've got to take that leap of faith and take a chance instead of just standing around waiting for something to happen. So, please, if you're (my friend) reading this, think about what I'm saying and...just follow your heart...b/c I love you and I want you to have what you deserve. Think about it...maybe the reason you found outabout this girl liking him wasb/c then that would make you start rethinking things and actually get you to do the right thing and tell him how you feel. You think?
