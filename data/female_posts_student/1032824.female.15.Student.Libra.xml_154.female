I firmly believe that they have displayed a great deal of outstanding leadership qualities, which I don't see during the weekly trainings. It can still be further improved though :)  Anyways, so friday was the UG camp. We had our CEP 2 after school so Nana, Geets dear and I went back home after that. I had to catch a cab for tuition after I had taken my bath because I was running late. I arrived early at the tuition centre -.-" Wenta' school at 9pm and watched the Talent time, followed through the night walk as an  observer  (my duty lor). Group leaders Christine and Jonathan were pretty good. At night.. mwahaha.. Weihao played the guitar while I sang to the tunes of "My immortal" by Evanescence, "Yellow" by Coldplay, "Breathe" by Michelle Branch, "Time of your life" by Green day, and so on.. there were so many kick-ass songs which he strummed! * Goes ga-ga over the melodious sounds of the acoustic guitar * I wish I could play as well as he could. Weihao is a super pro! In return of his out-going-ness (hehe), I also strummed a coupla tunes, such as "Swing swing" by the All American Rejects, "Paper heart" by AAR also.. Michelle's "Everywhere" and Avril's "I'm with you". I wasn't very good at it, but Weihao still said some nice things. I still remembered how I started out playing the guitar on my own after getting inspired by Sir Kevin from Tanglin NPCC. ATC days... :)  The UG leaders slept at around 3am plus.. and awoke at 5am+. I wenta' meet Nana, Mrs Chua and all for the PP slides competition at Temasek poly. So fun!! Mrs Chua.. MY IDOL! ;) After the whole thing, we wenta' Tampines mall for lunch and offered to treat us, but we declined her offer politely. Hehehe. Amesie, Nana and I + Mrs Chua then took a cab back to school, and I wenta' help out for the UG camp again. It was rather messy then.. but ah well!   Now that I'm back home.. I seriously need to catch up on my sleep. Toodles sweethearts!
