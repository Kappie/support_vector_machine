No fun :( Hehe I wrote that in my English exam though! My brother must have influenced me too much because under the 'ideal school' question I wrote a load of socialist crap! Which is good I guess... in a very small way. Hmm, I wonder if the guy who marks it will notice? Oh well. Yngwie Malmsteen is such a weird guy... is it a band? Oops. Hehe... Just checked - he's a guy and he has a 'Ask Yngwie' section on his website. Awww that's just asking for trouble.  urlLink http://www.yngwie.org/  Download - I am A Viking - damn weird.
