Finding th door with the key is leading me farther away from my dreams.  the path i've taken has lead me from the way with contradictions to my dreams  theres so many doors here, i can't find the one. I feel the waves, washing,  washng me away.  the things I'm finding i never knew i had. i know now that i've learned. i've locked away ....so many things. mistakes are made, and so i learn.   the key i've found  has unlocked so many doors. the waves i know, the friends i've made. so many things rushing a head.  through thick and thin ive learned to cope. death will come and ill tag  along. this is what the door has opened.  this is what the Key has done.    thets it. i love it so much. (just to tell you it is capywrited and if you use it, you have to notify me!) i went to the dentist this morning and we talked about toads. my dentist(she lives near me) told me that she has toads in her backyard and she wont mow her lawn while they're in front of the mower. DARN!!!! hehehe... bloody taod... hehehe.ha! i'm going to concordia now for TWO WEEKS instead of ONE!!!!!!!!
