I slept most of the way to Ohare (the airport in Chicago), then we got there and got our bags pretty quick. There was like no one on the road so we got to the hotel pretty quick. And the FUNNIEST thing happened! Okay, so we are pullin up to the hotel and I see this kid who looks about my age and I think to myself "Wouldn't that be funny if it was Mick?" and I'll give you one guess who it was. If you said Justin Timberlake you were wrong, but if you said Mick, you'd be right! (lol) So yea, I jumed out the cab and ran to him and gave him a big hug. So, we all checked in and I met his mom and step-dad. So me, daddy, and Sheil went to our room. It was very cool. Very modern art-deco. So, we found a restaurant that was like 20 feet (50 at the most) away from the hotel, and all us (my family and his) went to eat at this really nice place. Our parents really seemed to hit it off. My dad (of course) talked like there was no tomrrow. Then, me and Mick went out side to wait for them cause they were paying and we were bored. So we are chillin outside and this guy in a Sponge Bob (it was Holloween keep in mind) and he goes to Mick, "Here's what you gotta do, you gotta buy this girl a sports car cause shes high equity (or something like that) cause shes beautiful." and then he just walked away. We were like... o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0okay... so then we got back to the hotel and our parents went out for drinks and we hung out for a while and then at 12:30 I hadda go back to my room. The next morning I woke up early and we met up with Mick and his family and Mick was gonna ride with us to Sheils friend Anns house and then they were all gonna show us a fast way to ND. So we get to Anns like 10 years later and then... we went to Notre Dame. I think it gets more beautiful every time I see it. So we get there and we walked around, we went to the place where we said goodbye after camp, we went to the ice staking rink, walked past the track, we went to the library were "Touchdown Jesus" is, and then we had to go to the stadium. The game was good... yea Notre Dame lost 37-0 but it was still a good experiance.  So then we walked to the bookstore and I got a new sweat shirt (me and my sweat shirts lol). So then (and I think this was the BEST part of the whole trip), I rode home in Mick's car and, I dunno.... this was just the BEST part of the trip. It was like, the most time we really had to be together ya know? So, we got back to the hotel, and then me and Mick went to get something to eat in the hotel restaurant and then me and him just hung out in the hotel, chillin for the little time we had left. So, then, the time finally came to say goodbye. It was hard. It was like... I dunno... just.. I felt like something wanted me to like, I dunno... stay there but I knew I had to go ya know? So, then, I turned around and walked into my room. The next morning (this morning actually) we woke up early and went to the airport. I kinda hoped I would see Mick this morning but, I didn't. So, yea.. then we got to the airport and onto the plane and GUESS who was sitting in front of me... Mick Foley, the wrestler... and this was no Mr. Lichter thing either (lol Erica)! I saw his name on his luggage that he was carrying with him on the plane. So, I slept the whole way home and then I went to my dads house and that's where I am now. So, it was a VERY great weekend. It was so much fun but I wish it had lasted longer. A lot longer. So, I'm going to go now, I'm watching "The Others". Peace x0x
