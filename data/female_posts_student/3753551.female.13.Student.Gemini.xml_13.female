I have. I feel like that right now.  Right fucking now!!!  So yeah. Thats how im feeling. I also feel like Im never going to fucking meet anyone whos going to understand me. Thats making me feel like absoloute CRAP.   White white white   Black Black Black    R  a  i  n  b  o  w   C  o  l  ou  r ...................................
