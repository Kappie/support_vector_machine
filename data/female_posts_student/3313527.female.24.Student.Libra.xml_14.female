I am honored that they have all figured out that I will be a good and respectful listener, and won't 'tell' on them, but good  God . So much for cameraderie. So much for workers-of-the-world-unite. How else are we going to show our bosses who's  really  boss if we keep this schoolyard stuff up? I think we need to reconsider the seven deadly sins and think about putting petty infighting nearer to the top of the list. It creates more misery, and is more prevalent, than a lot of those other sins. I mean, there's not  that  much murder, granted any at all is too much. But we don't really need a rule for that one- most of us pretty quickly figure out it's a bad idea, and I'm sure for people who are capable of murder the fact that it's a 'sin' isn't really going to stop them. But who isn't guilty of petty infighting? Which sin does that fall under? Jealousy, greed? I don't know, I guess it's a blend.... but it feels like it's a new beast altogether.
