And she's like, "Aww...Miss Munday, you're even writing different (note Pip's BAD USE OF GRAMMAR!! haha) beacuse you're in looooovvee!!" Good 'ol Miss Munday just laughed. Kiera is also making a board game 4 CCG. Except hers is really morbid and dark. It's called "Who Wants to Destroy Australia?" and to win, you have to kill the most people and rob the government of the most money. Haha. It's hilarious. SO typically Kiera though. I can't wait 2 see the final product! At lunchtime, once again we put the bin in the middle of our circle of chairs, and kicked it around. Haha. We have the weirdest group! Half of us hate the bin kicking and half of us love it. And Julia took heaps of pics of us on her camera. Ranging from "Tree Lovers" to "Stacks on Jess!!!!" hehehehe.... 'Tears of Heaven' is an extreamly hard song 2 play!! Argh! Andy says I'm going alright, but yeh i dunno. I 'spose I have only just started. But I really wanna learn the song cuz its sooo cool!! :D Guitar was quite nice though. It was all warm inside, and Andy had placed the heater right behind my chair so it was all warm for me!! He's a really sweet guy! :D And he also made me a hot Milo when I came in. Yuuuumm...I was all warm and toasty and having heaps of fun! :) 'Snaps 4 Andy!' Tensions are running high in our household. Everyone is sick, and my brother and Dad just had a screaming fight becuase Dad wanted Callum 2 go in the shower but he didn't want 2 get off the computer. Hehe, he's gonna be REALLY angry when he sees ME on it! Mwhahaha.... Y'know this week seems like it's gonna be alright actually. After a shocker like last wk I'm glad!! Bloggin off, Beth
