So, this weekend has seemed so long. it's only 12:30 on sunday and I'm trying to keep my eyes open. guess it must be one of those three-day-weekend side effects. But I mean, thursday was awesome- baltimore is such a cool city, and thursday night was fun too. Then friday was awesome too- 13 going on 30 is a really good movie, i highly recomend it. Saturday was interesting... Alison and I got to hang out with a foreign exchange student from france,... it was... kinda awkward.   Today is our first sccr game of the season. C'mon intensity, i know we can win this one. and it's a home game, we got mclean to represent! haha, hell yes. I'm really looking forward to it- it feels like forever since I've had the opportunity to shove a girl and not get in trouble for it. I've missed the damn sport!
