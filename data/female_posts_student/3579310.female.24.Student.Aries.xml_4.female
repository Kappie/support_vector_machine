This year has been so strange. I cannot believe all that has happened has happened in less than 365 days. There was toooooo much drama this year and stress and so many other bad things. Anyways, I just made this blog cuz I wanted to reply to my friends blog, but mine too will beinteresting....  Well maybe tommorrow it will be interesting cuz I cannot type now..... too tired... just went out ot celebrate the completion of another year of school... see ya all tomorrow :o))
