Then I realized the idiot liberals who run the major networks decided not to carry the speech anyway. And some (ahem, Mom) would argue that there is no political agenda in the media. Puhleeze. God forbid, they should carry an important speech that spells out the Administration's plans regarding Iraq, they might actually have to stop accusing the President of having "no official plan". Thanks to  urlLink FOX News  for reprinting the speech in it's entirety on their site for those of us who know that agenda setting goes beyond the textbooks in Communication for Dummies.
