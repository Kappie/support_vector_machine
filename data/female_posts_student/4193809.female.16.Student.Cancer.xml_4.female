Seriously need to find a way to zap cellulite. There's an unsightly amount on the back of my thighs, and if I'm not careful it will migrate to the front.  I just had a thought. Somebody needs to talk to the people at Macys and Bloomingdales and the like. If they only made their size 12's the size of their 14's, I think they would sell many, many more pants. Women will go to a store where they can fit into pants a size below what they normally wear. It's common sense!
