I feel so alone and unwanted. Maybe I am.  I can't really know that.  I have moments when it feels like everything happens for a reason. So, I guess the negative feelings have reasons too. Only, I don't want to see those reasons. Tonight I really feel like taking my life... of course I won't, though. I never do. But, the worst thing is that no one really cares. No one really cares if I'm alive or not. And even if they do, I can guarantee that they'd get over my death fast. I'm such an avrage person. I blend in. My looks blend in, my personality blends in. I don't stand out. At all.  I wish I found my person. The one that'd be there always, always. And so many times, I've lead my self to believe that I have found that person. But I seem to be wrong each time.  I wish I stood out. I wish I was noticed.  I wish I was well liked.  I wish I was loveable.  I wish I was...    I wish.
