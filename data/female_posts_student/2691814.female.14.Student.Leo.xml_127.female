Im cryin 'on the inside' haha ryan.  *sigh*...i wonder..when i move what am i going to be doing for the rest of my summer?...probably calling everyone like ryan, francesca(when i get her new number) Samantha,Jesica,Deidra,Paola. Everyone gave me their numbers and told me to call them so i will. I'm going to miss everyone so much. I'll miss the 'grrs' in mr.mosers class lmao, i'll miss the dumb blonde jokes, the name macey(dont ask), Im just going to miss being here. I actually started liking this place just a while ago and now i have to move. This is the time where everyone gets the closest then someone has to move away. I hate moving...Even if im still in the same state, same town, i move to a different house or apartment every year. Signing yearbooks gets to me also...and everyones bringing their cameras and taking pictures. (i gotta get my film developed) and ya. I'm gonna miss this year. haha good times 'ghosts in apt.101' lol..we were so scared. 'This feels nice..' (dont ask) lmao. This year has been filled with so many funny things...never a dull moment with my friends. Barely any tears...but now...sadness. just remember 'Franny luvs you' and so do i!!   D-day:::4 days
