Besides, I need to finished the Microsoft Project again, luckily, I had bring the sample of the Final Year Project of CityU along with me. Also, today need to prepare the presentation for tomorrow.  又放假，有時真的唔太鍾意放假。但今日我要做好份報告，我自己那一部份。個報告係關於高的建築物，仲要做個工序表出來，真麻煩。幸好我有帶之前在香港城市大學的畢業功課來，裡面有個例子。仲有仲有，要準備明天的演說。
