I know who is Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, Tripikana, Ne Zha and I've been to China! I've watched before "Madam White Snake", "A Chinese Ghost Story", "Returns of a Condor Heroes" etc. Even though I don't know much about Mao ZeDong, Qing Shi Huang, Wu ZeTian, Deng Xiao Ping etc. But so? They Are DEAD! DEAD DEAD DEAD! HAHAHAHA! Okay, i'm being an idiot here.  Anyway, I  used  to want to work in China. I'm serious! China is SO big, the population is SO big, if every citizen in China buys something which i market [say it cost S$1, i'll be a billionaire already! HAHAHA!] But i realised that.. maybe not lah huh. My mandarin is not up to standard. It's simply mediocre. There's so many people in Singapore taking higher chinese, what am i compared to them?  And I don't agree with Lee Kuan Yew that only a handful of Singaporeans aka the "elites" can master two languages and become bilingual. Not many would agree with me, as in disagreeing with LKY. Afterall, he is THE MAN. While i'm not even THE WOMAN. HAHAH! Okay WTF.  I think it is this thing called  Interest  that spurts people to go the extra mile to learn a language. And it's already 4.23! OMFG.   to be continued..   or maybe not.  All the best to those taking their MYES.
