Everytime you look my way  I realize more and more  How much I adore those pretty eyes  Of yours, I'm helpless baby   What I wanna know is  Are you willing to try  Can you love me for a lifetime  In just one night  Ohh...   Baby I love you (love you)  Baby I need you (need you)  I gotta have you (I gotta have you babe)  Can't be without you (be without you)   Baby I love you (yeah...)  Baby I need you (need You...)  I gotta have you (I gotta have you babe)  Can't be without you   Blessed and cursed on the same day,  The day that I first felt the power of you  Inside of me, such a strong feeling  There comes a time in everyone's life  When you know, and everyone around you knows  That everything is changed,  You're not the same, it's a new day   Oh... what I wanna know is,  Are you willing to try  There's got to be more meaning to this  Than what meets the eye...   Baby I love you  Baby I need you (baby I need you)  Gotta have you baby (I gotta have you)  Can't be without you (can't be without you)   Baby I love you (baby I love you)  Yea yeah...
