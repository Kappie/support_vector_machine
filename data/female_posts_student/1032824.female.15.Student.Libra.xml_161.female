The most inspiring, youthful, incredibly beautiful, amusing, intelligent, caring, motherly and helpful teacher ever..  Mrs T. Chua . You go girl!  Sir Faizal recorded our march past on a video cam yesterday and I'm waiting for Senior Xiongster to come online to send it to me. * Yawns * :P Today's training was pretty much different cos like, we had games and cheers this time round. I miss training for Speech Day already. Can somebody please wake me up? * Hears Sadhiq, ' Wake up lah !' * It ended quite emotionally for me, because I felt worried.   To my kids, I love you all, and I hope you guys strive hard and stick together no matter what, while taking over the unit when we are not around. You guys  have  the potential, just work hard and don't complain about little issues (I know some of you are fond of doing that, haha). I'll leave you all with a quote by Robert K. Greenleaf.  "The only test of leadership is that somebody follows."  All the best!
