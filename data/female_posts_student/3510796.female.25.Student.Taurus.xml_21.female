On the drive home tonight, I flipped over to the local college station, because, as has increasingly become the case, the commercial stations had nothing to offer me.  And when you've got a car that doesn't even have a tape deck, well, you become pretty handy at scanning the dial.  So I hear two songs in a row that take me back - way back - "Pepper" by Butthole Surfers and "Popular" by Nada Surf.  Do you realize those songs are from 1996?  8 f'ing years ago?!?  I find myself complaining more and more about "the music these kids liten to these days..."  Next thing you know, I'll be telling them to get off my damn lawn.  For me, the best of pop music originates from an era which, I suppose it does for many others, as well - the later years of high school and the first few of college, about 1994-99 in my case.  After that, everyone just started screaming - a lot.  Angry gradually took the place of melancholy, things like melody and harmony got tossed aside in favor of fast and frantic, and one day, you look around and find that a retard like Fred Durst has gone multi-platinum, and Kid Rock's rolling in 8 figures a year for rapping about Pabst Blue Ribbon with a midget.  Oh, you say you wanna find a female voice on a rock - or even alternative - station?  Unless it's Courtney Love, good luck.  Bands like Garbage, Radiohead, U2, Oasis - bands that once defined a genre, would now be considered way too light to even be considered for airplay by any rock or alternative station programmer.  Dave Matthews now sings of how he loves you oh so well on a station targeted toward soccer moms and other assorted thirtysomethings.  There are bands on the radio right now - the one that comes to mind at the moment is called Story of the Year - where you can listen to their songs and practically hear the record executive say, "Listen, guys, we're never gonna be able to sell this unless you throw some screaming in these tracks at some point."  So, what's a pop-music fiend and self-avowed radio junkie like myself to do?  Well, on my recent road trip, I found temporary solace and refuge.  There are two stations in Michigan - one in Grand Rapids, one in Detroit - that call themselves "alternative" and play music from the 90s as well as the stuff from today.  Someone out there figured out how to successfully include the music of the past decade with a solid rotation of current tracks.  It doesn't sound like something that should be hard to figure out, but the so-called alternative station in Chicago really doesn't care to recognize the 1990s unless it involves Nirvana or Metallica, outside of their specialty show at noon.  Here's hoping this twaeking of a format takes off, so I won't have to spend so much time driving with one hand on the wheel and one on the tuner buttons.  In the meantime, here's where I can cop my musical fix.   urlLink WGRD Grand Rapids  - one of the stations that gave me happiness in Michigan - and they stream!   urlLink 93 XRT Radio Chicago  - They call it Chicago's finest rock, and it is.  from the '60s up to today, they cover a wide area.  It's not always what I want to listen to, but it's got a lot of good going for it.   urlLink WXAV 88.3 Chicago  - Ah, college rock, or as I call it, Russian Roulette Radio.  You're just as likely to find something you haven't heard in forever and love as you are to hear something you've never heard before and loathe.  As for the station in D-Town, well, they don't stream, but their website is  urlLink here.
