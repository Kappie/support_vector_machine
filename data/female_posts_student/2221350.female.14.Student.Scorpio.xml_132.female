I could write pages on the short comings and horrible editing of this little ditty which completely undermines the book, but I'll spare you this time. It was a nice PG 3 hours of entertainment nonetheless.  I went to the mall with Lauren and the terrible two, which is always a mistake. Luckily I had a cell phone and was able to escape the abercrombie wrath that is 3 nitwits((Lauren, Devon, Valerie)) and a mall. I bought some black bracelets, as my clear sparkly ones are starting to run out as a make new friends. I also found this amazing purse which I cannot afford and shall not take part in any expensive((expensive being more than 10 bucks)) ((shut up, I'm a teenager)) until I can buy the lovely wonderful staple of my daily raiment. Shall I describe it ((the men can close their eyes and say booga booga booga)) it's made out of.. seatbelts! Yeah, it's all this seatbelt material woven together and I looove it. Most unfortunately, it's 120$, meaning I must raise another 40 bucks.  then finally, although I was exhausted, I babysat. Another 30$ to add to the purse fund.   have I mentioned lately that I hate children?  today was, to say the least, a shitty one. ((C'mon, you knew that was coming! a whole Monday of fun and you thought Tuesday would be alright?)) it began this afternoon at 1PM, when I woke up. How the hell I slept 10 hours, I don't know, but hey. Probably the main reason is because I had another weird dream. I dreamt that I was in a crib((that's a baby bed, not a gangsta's abode)) and that a guy climbed in, smooched me, then kinda disappeared, then he did it again, then all these different kinds of dogs jumped into the crib and layed at my feet, then left. And all the while, I was aware of the fact that I was in a barn that's a few miles back into the woods near my house.  today I found out that I won't be able to go to my dad's AT ALL this summer. THIS TOTALLY SUCKS BIG GREEN DONKEY DICKS. Although I am upset at the prospect of rotting away in Shreveport this summer, I'm surprisingly unfazed. It's almost as if I expected this to happen. Perhaps my mother is right and daddio is truly an asshole. I wasn't there when he made the call, but my mother said he said that he couldn't handle kids what with work and all. Um, helloooo! I'm sure you are really busy, daddy, but I still exist and it's your fricking seed that dragged me kicking and screaming into this sublevel media obsessed drug dealing backstabbing hellhole.  after the fight with my dad, my mother felt it neccesary to get drunk and bug the shit out of me all afternoon and into the evening. just what I like after finding out my father doesn't want me, dealing with my crocked mother.  one more thing--- urlLink Jan the Ho  wrote a really great post today.  oh, and the reason I'm not blogging more is because my grandmother found out she doesn't get the thingy on the thingy on the computer, so she's been "fixing it" for the last week, in other words, staying on here from 9AM until 12AM, literally.
