Any Jo, if you come to the park on Friday bring Paul so he can meet everyone else and we can meet him! A friend is coming over today and we are having Keanu Film Day. Hehe. Should be a laugh. What can I ramble about? Um, well I am watcing Laurel and Hardy and they are really funny. I have already today text Sikon (at 12.08) gone to bed, got up, showered, eaten and cleaned my room. I am now posting here and surfing the web until 11 when I shall meet my friend. It should be a good laugh today/ I haven't watched the Matrix on our big tele yet.
