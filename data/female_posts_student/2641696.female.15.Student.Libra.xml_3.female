On Friday I managed to convince mummy dear (and yes that's sarcasm, for all of you who are stupid) that it was far too dangerous to go driving to school. About an hour later (too late to get there :p), mummy dear realized I was a jerk and she should have driven us anyways =D   Muahaha. Now, to take over the world...   Anyways, other than that life is pretty good. Kinda boring, just because that is basically life's definition, but I won't complain too much about it. Oh! Also mad at Amy (hehe) because she didn't invite me to Caila's party! :p lollll. I wouldn't have been able to come; I had a piano master class - but  still ! Amy, I am appalled and disgustified at your behaviour. heh.   Something else that's interesting... I'm sure some of you have at least heard of the book Life of Pi, and mummy dear and I were talking about it on the way to my master class... I haven't read it yet, but mum thinks I should, because apparently the theme is pretty cool (or at least, her/her book club's take on it) - life based on a good story (as in, based on a religion or faith) is better than life without one (as in, reality). Yes? No? I can't really decide. I mean, avoiding what the world is really like (we live, we die, that's it, nothing more) by believing, without any sort of evidence other than that belief, in a religion... that seems kind of wimpy. Shouldn't we face the world head on? Accept what we're given, deal with it, not go 'into denial' like most people do? Take the blue pill, instead of the red pill? Or vica versa, since I haven't seen the Matrix for a loong time.. hehe.   But then again, there's nothing wrong with being happy. If living a lie (I guess I'm kind of biased towards living reality lol) lets you deal with life's undeniable injustices, and maybe make some good out of it, then would the lie itself be worth it?   Questions, questions, questions... The question I asked up there ^^^ gets me started on another... do the ends justify the means? Peter asked this crazy question to me and Murdles and some others a few weeks ago (haha, we even have it on tape lol): if, by murdering an innocent, you could solve world hunger, would you? I still have no idea what my answer would be. And I'll shut up now, before I launch into another crazy philosophical debate with myself. I'll just ... keep it in my head. lol :p
