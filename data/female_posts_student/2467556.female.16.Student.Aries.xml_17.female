Oh yeah! today in English we got to help these little first graders with their letters to Santa!!!!  It was soooo cute!  Elizabeth had this little Finnish Kid named Leevi.....he was sooo adorable! He spoke perfect formal english and he plays hockey, he was so cute! Here's how our conversation went: Me: Hey Leevi! Are you finnish? Leevi: No Me: hmmm...ok are you from Finland? Leevi: Yes, i am from Finland.  I am from *random finnish city that i didn't understand* Me: Oh thats nice and you play hockey? Leevi: Yes i play hockey. Me and my friends, i mean, my friends and I play on a hockey team together. Me: Oh do you play for a mini-mite team? Leevi: No, i play hockey on a team with my friends and I Me: um...ook....are you going to play for the NHL? Leevi: No, i play hockey Me: No, but are you going to play professionally in the National Hockey League? Leevi: No, i play hockey. Me: hmmmm ok ~~~~~~ AND then! i discovered that my little first grader girl that was with me had a crush on this finnish kid, Leevi!!  She kept on whispering in my ear about how he's finnish and plays hockey and how she thought he was sooo cute.  of course, it seemed that Leevi was oblivious to the whole thing.  She's a girl after my own heart (lol Nadia and Kendra)!!!  it was so adorable, the little girl reminded me of myself when i was that age.  Oh yes, in other news, Me, Kendra and Nadia planned our weddings in aerobics today....but it appeared that we mostly planned mine.  Nadia is going to have an 80's wedding, how frickin' cool is that! And Kendra is going to have an Asian wedding....even though she's not asian.  And i, evidently, am going to get married on an ice rink to a hockey player.  I'm going to have Dallas Stars colors, ice skates on everyone's feet, jerseys on me and my husband to trade before we do the kiss-the-bride bit and the reception is even better.  You have to remember that this is mostly spawned from Kendra and Nadia's brains with just a little help from me.  The reception is going to be at a hotel with dancing etc and then we're going to have a big Plasma TV to watch the hockey game on, if there is one on that date.  Coasters for drinks will be hockey pucks and everyone who comes gets a complimentary hockey puck.  There will be 3 different cakes: one that looks like a hockey stick, one that's the finnish flag (since Kendra says i'm obviously going to marry a finnish hockey player because of my niko-liking tastes), and one that is a big wedding cake with a little woman hockey player and a man hockey player on top.  Kendra also said today that if i don't marry a finnish hockey player, i'm letting everyone down and crushing everyone's dreams or something.  Hmmm, i'll try my best not to ruin everything lol.  Nadia said she's not coming to my wedding if i don't marry a finnish hockey player thats like Niko or whatever lol.  I got to get to work on that, lol.  Yeah so thats all i can remember from our wild planning of weddings today but it was really really funny especially when we've still got about 10 years before we have to worry.  Oh yeah and i almost forgot, apparently i'm going to drive away from my wedding on a Zamboni that says Just Married.  I came up with that one a while ago with Brittany, but we just revisited it.    Actually today was kinda boring besides aerobics....oh yeah! 4-1 win for Coppell over Flower Mound! At one point we had FIVE FREAKING PLAYERS in the Penalty Box! And alot of our key players too!  It was crap, it all started when Adam Havens ran into this other guy upon which it looked like an accident and then all of the sudden in about 5 mins, one by one, 4 more people were added in.  Me and Brittnee were freaking out.  But what's sad is that we almost scored a goal on them when they had 3 more players than us.  And FM's one goal, i have to give them props...it was a beautiful goal.  Maybe if ozowski wasn't so busy trying to do the freaking splits to save the puck, they wouldn't have scored.  Oh well, we get TJ back next week anyways and then we can start kicking major ass again.  yaaaaay! Go Coppell all the way, let's win State second time straight!!!!  Niko Rocks,  ~~~Taylor~~~
