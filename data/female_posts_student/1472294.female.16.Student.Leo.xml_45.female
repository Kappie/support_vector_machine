That's was the reason I dropped my 2 (out of 3) pure science subjects to sub- science, I feel so ordinary now. -__- Anyway, I did not really appreciate the subjects the way my classmates did (they discuss it  everywhere , AND we are not the best sch though WE are the best class, jeezzzz....) Back to SERIOUS business. That's about me!!! *smile*  CCA  : In case u do not know, it is Core Curriculum Activities AND I am in gb (work it out urself again *__*) Have to go, if not I will have to burn the midnight oil. Which is no good and our teachers recommend us to sleep at 8pm. Oooppsss, it IS WAY past 8 already. 0_0
