Maybe its beacuse I've done it all, and its all a repeating episode for me.  Or maybe its because he's so different from the rest.  Laura has this thing where she refuses to go out with her friends. I said you her, Posh! No fun in that. But I would agree with her. The amount of friends I lost by getting more invovled with them is phenominal. But I just don't see that happening here.  **************************  Laura is bugging me again. She said she didn't want us kissing and junk around her, so we went the cubby beside the bench. You can't see anyone in the cubby unless you lean around and look in. So Nick pulled me in there after school, and Laura clung onto me and yelled out, "No, don't leave me!!" I'm so confused about her.  ****************************  Adam is getting on my nerves too. I told him we had to chill off, give it time. My polite way of saying "Fuck off." And he did stay distant. For about 3 days. Now he wants me to go to his house and model my new bathing suit in front of him in his hot tub. I kept telling him, now, I don't want to, and yet he still emails me asking what time I'll be over. I don't want to be mean, but how else is he going to get the picture? He's trying to make me show him my new suit, when I barely feel comfortable wearing it yet (I literally feel topless wearing it. It's frightening.) It's not good. I don't want to be mean, but if that's the only way...  Oh, if only I wasn't so pigheaded and listened to Ash all those days and months ago. Sure, I had reasons for getting mad at Ash, he was getting way too weird, but he was right about me and Adam. I was too blinded by my infactuation, and thinking I was in love with him to see....  *************************  But other than that, life is beautiful. I cannot honestly wait for the weekend, it's going to be great. I can tell already.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Sunday, April 18, 2004   How do you know he's a good kisser?  1. He knows what to do. He knows when the opportune time is to kiss you, and it isn't awkward, it's...yeah. 2. His hands just don't sit there, they know where to go. They travel up and down your back, or cup your face. 3. He uses variety in his kisses...sometimes forceful and hungrily, so you can taste his fiery passion, sometimes sweet and gentle so you can feel his love and savour the moment. 4. When he kisses you, you can feel his emotion, and even his want for you flow through into you, and gives you life.  5. Doesn't slobber all over your mouth so that when you're done, you don't need a towel to wipe all the dripping gross slobber off your face.  6. He makes you feel good, improves your mood so that you are smiling no matter what you felt before.     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------   Well. It's been a while.  Last weekend was busy. We all went camping in Laura's backyard fri-sat (Matt, Stevey, Sean, Nicky, Laura, me, and Nana). We all stayed up late and talked, and played cards. It was a lot of fun. We watched matchstick men, threw candy at Maquested, and went to our seperate tents around 2...I couldn't sleep, and the guys were still talking, so I went with the intent to go talk with them, but ended up talking an hour long walk up and down Blackthorn with Nicky..(it's not even a very long road :P) We watched the moon rise, and gazed at the stars, and kissed...of course. He's so dreamy sometimes.   Everyone piled into the guys tent in the morning, as sleepy as we all were..watched the guys do guy things, and listened to what they did after us girls left. Then everyone began to pewter out, and leave...Nicky left for his drum thingy, but then came back. We went for a walk around and through Centenial, sat and..talked a little there. Ran into Adam (:S), Lannie, and my parents..quite exciting. Sunday, Laura, Kim, Stevey, Alistair and Nicky and I all were at Stevey's to do our english project. Steve's parents gave us all an easter egg hunt too. It was fun. Good solid waste of a day.  The week was filled with going to every single one of my classes, no matter how boring. Quite proud of myself. Tuesday night was parent night at youth, was fairly fun, I guess. Babysat Ayla Thursday and Friday. Didn't go home until late. T'was fun.   Saturday I got to sleep in (sorta). Went to Gramma's to mow lawn in the afternoon, then got a pair of new shoes..Saw a bathing suit at Walmart I am now coveting, and wanting. Then went to Nick's house for dinner and movie and junk. Was very very very very very very fun. Very.  I rang the bell, and he opened the door, he looked soo handsome and tasty, wearing a white shirt with a blue one on top. Very sexy. Smelt gorgeous, and looked it. I played with Mr Boots, and Nick's music and Mr Crowley as Nick made dinner. Fettecini alfredo. Very very delicious, some of the best I've had in a while. Watched/listened to a bit of the hockey game, then watched/listened to Signs. Good movie, very jumpy...Scared me a couple of times. We cuddled lost, and then watched/listened to the rest of the hockey game...boy was that intense. Good day.  Today so far, I've done jack all, barely managing to pull my ass out of bed and plunk it in front of the computer. the most movement I did was to find some stupid bread for my breakfast. That was too much effort. Now I'm in the process of convincing parents that they wanna go to Walmart. So far...I don't think it's working.  Till next time, Bat-folks...and always remember, Nick is your god :)    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Sunday, April 11, 2004   the emotional tormant, oh the pain take me away from this everlasting strain; i see clouds in your eyes, its all i can see; your pain bearing down hurts me, i can't move around; change my gaze, change the locks, where are you  i'm thirsting for your touch; the house bears its silence upon me, i stir; it is so still in here, i cannot bear to make a sound; beg the telephone to ring, hear you voice on the other side; fear is injected to me and i scream; i can't be here, i can't sit here, i refuse to let you do this to me; torment, pain, seaking savior, survival of the fittest; when were you watching me, i cannot remember; i awoke to your eyes piercing my soul, searching for a lie; i have no strength to bear this truth for you; outside i was safe, everything surrounded me no sounds to be near; sun beating down, relax it's all right. topless tanning, lying on the rug, blood pooling around me; i'm tired of all the games and the lies and the deciet. hurt me now, love me then; i wanted you the most in this game of pain and lies and you said you wanted me back; you ran away, forever and away, and laughed as i collapsed; heavy breathing, hours of thinking, oceans of tears; you changed everything about me; the way i talked, acted, sung, heard, and looked, you changed the depth in my eyes; you can see the holes you poked in my skin; the knife bears down upon my skin and a faint red line appears; time goes by and so does life, the blood dripping off my arm in babbling brooks, streams, rapid rivers. i gasp, you are shocked, and animals die around me; i hurt for you there is no where to run; im trapped in this game and i want to escape you hold my heart and the key, toying around with what you must; i loved you forever, but now its time to go.  time to fly time to die time to lie. i love another now he brings smiles to my face; flowers words of kindness, bandaids.  he has no idea how used i am, how broken, how battered my body is; and when he touches me there, it sends ripples of lust throuout my body; i eat at him hungreily, longing for a longer hour to be there, pain across my body in bites; he left me there to bleed;  i am but a simple carcass.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Friday, April 09, 2004   I woke up this morning around ten, warm and happy, and smiling. I can't remember the last time I woke up smiling, and I wasn't having a dream, so it was cool. My cat jumped on my face, and she was happy, because she can now sit in the window and soak up the sun. My mom had made me toast on her way out to go shopping, so I didn't have to make breakfast. (I was looking forward to the pancakes Greg was gonna make me, but whatcha gonna do.) I ate my breakfast then went out to sit on the sidewalk and talk to my mom while she hung out the laundry. It was sooooo warm and delicious out there, a perfect way to wake up. She went back inside, and I stayed out for another half hour, soaking up the warmth, and hoping for an early tan.   It was while sitting outside on the sidewalk, listening to all the millions of loud, chirping (and annoying) birds, that I realized something. When Iw as growing up, we didn't have a lot of money around, cause it was only Dad working. Mom didn't work so she could look after us and the property, because when I was growing up, there was a LOT more to do than there is now. So we didn't have a lot of money to go out on family excursions, or to buy me something new everytime I wanted it. And I realized why. Growing up, my momw wasn't just buying food for me, my brother, my dad, and herself. She was also buying food for 3 cats (or more, I think we fed a few of the wild ones.), 2 dogs, a handful of chickens, bunny rabbits, rats and mice (but that's just because they built up an resistance to rat poison.), and millions and millions of birds. We fed everything that came upon our property, whether we owned it or not. We fed the sheep, and cows, and pigs that came to live in the field beside us. We fed the wild bunnies, and the bunnies that were dropped off. We fed the neighboorhood cats and dogs, including our 3 cats. We had gazillions of wild birds, swallows, sparows, blackbirds, finchs, chicadees, even a freaking pheasent at one point! And until this point, I had not realized how kinda lucky I was to live in such an animal paradise..and even though I want to move, and live closer to my friends and everything else, how could I possibly leave this place of paradise?
