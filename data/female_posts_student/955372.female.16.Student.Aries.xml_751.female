That's a lot of traffic. Good lord. ok here are the things that should be noted from that trip. *spent entire trip up there reading Catch-22 and listening to music (i didn't finish the book which was my goal but hey) *when we got there my uncle mario was wearing no shirt, and he is neither a thin man nor an unhairy man (he did this for three days straight and refused to wear a shirt even at meals, i almost puked) *bought numerous items at the Walmart, including flip-flops for $4.85. They're squishy. *at the family reunion I'm pretty sure that everyone thought me and my cousin were people that wandered off the street because we smelled food. Which might as well be true because we didn't talk to anyone and stole the candy from the little kids when they broke open the pinata. *also at the family reunion aunt angie thought my dad was tim and congradulated him on his new grandchild. I was later confronted and told I've been hiding stuff from the family *family reunion= bocci ball and illegal fireworks *I found out that my psychotic uncle john bought a piece of property SOLEY to put a BOCCI BALL COURT on it. yes. I'm not even kidding. *ungodly long drive home *at a unimart i bought one of those cheap "jelly watches" that are like digital pieces of crap. They are the Swatches of the 21st century. It's hot pink.
