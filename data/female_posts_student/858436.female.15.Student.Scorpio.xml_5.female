I worked outside at the carwash. Caro and I hung out with Haley Bohnert. She is the sweetest person ever! OMG I love her! Hehe! :-P And I met Demi, Jessica, and Destiny too. They're sweet girls as well. :-)  I am so hyper right now! I can't stop laughing and I'm not talking to anyone! That's what I get for drinking like, 1 iced tea at the dinner and 2 Pepsis at home! :-D
