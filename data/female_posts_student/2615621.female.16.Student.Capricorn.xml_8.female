Liz was my "date" so dont even begin to think i had something going on with lornes bud, that's too mean haha. Well, ashley got pissed off at me cuz i didnt tell her how ugly joe was...so what...deal u shallow bitch. Yeah, he's not the hottest, and yeah..he looks like a freakin weird monster some little kid would be scared of, but hey, i wanted you to find out yourself. There has been too many times where i've called someone ulgy to only find out the person i was telling that to thought differently. I wasn't going to ruin anything for ashley. (muhahaha i knew he was butt ass ulgy and i knew she'd think the way she did). but who cares. I would only do that to ashley. lol Thats why i told joe to stay away from liz and lauren!! haha as in realtionship wise. He thinks lauren is taken my Willbo ne ways. :D   Mikel went all out asking about Lauren and i went off on him when he said he heard lauren was a flirt. UGH i'd give anything to bet katie mckee started it. she cant stand for lauren to have any attention, when lauren gets attention over anyone, doesnt matter who it is, i'm sittin there going YAY!! THATS MY GIRL!! not "omg how to steal it away from her" fuck anyone who does that to my bitch lauren. hahaha ( i got ur back girl). Lauren deserves a lot more credit for everything than people give her. They listen to katie mckee too much, they stare at katies stupid ass boobs way too much to actually listen to what she says and think "omg is this girl crazy?!" and make their own minds up about the people katie talks about. pisses me off more than anything. Mikel did call Lauren hot, and i corrected him MAJORLY on his "i hear shes a big flirt" statement. fuck whoever started that shit.   The last few days i've been thinkin about lorne on and off more and more. And i thought i liked him again and i would try to patch all the cuts i've already made, but then, and maybe it just hit me..i'm not going to try. I dont want to be single anymore...but i dont want someone who lives 30mins away from me and can't drive yet....  My mom has been dating my neighbor lately, they are going on their 2nd date tonite, well 2nd offical date, i dont think them hanging out at each other houses really count. She hasnt really told anyone about these hot dates though..lol i think its funny. I'm so glad shes going out and having fun with him. He's a really nice guy and loves to do things. My ex-step-dad never did anything like that. He always sat around the basement being a stupid pain in the ass grumpy fuck off. He never took mom anywhere and was a 24/7 bitch making her a 24/7 bitch at times. Well...he's gone thank god, and i'm glad mom is finally have fun. Shes going to the movies tonite with john and out to dinner. Her and mike were married for like 7 years and he never took her to the movies. fuck him. She's really happy and tomorrow shes taking me shopping!! yay!! haha i like it when shes happy..hehehe that means im happy too. She's already told me she's not going to remarry...i hope shes right. It's only the 2nd date, and she's not legally divorced, only seperated, but the thought of another man in my mom's life like that scares the shit outta me. I know...i know...i've just been through too much. I was such a daddy's girl and i did everything with my dad and mike wasnt a "dad" to me, it was like he tried to take my dad's place but he never could..he only told me he loved me 1 time and i didnt say anything back, and it was when he first married my mom...I can't deal with that shit. Ok...before i get on a kick about my shitty childhood like ally hilfigure i'm gonna stop...lol But just for the record, my childhood was great until my parents divorced.   MY DAD IS COMING TO VISIT FEB 6-7th!! yay!!! i cant wait..means i get to see him and go shopping yay! :D
