I wrote this for a reason-- you knew this before I did-- you knew I needed to reassure myself that I can handle anything this morning.   Dot's gone. Lastnight at around seven she drove off of the side of the road and hit a tree... and God took her with him to His home. It is so hard to swallow this because Dot was so full of life, goodness she had a 16 year old son, Brad. Why? I know he needed her with all of his heart, I don't think he has a father. She was the only one that he had, and now he has no one. Goodness, I am hurt so much today, and I am not even directly affected... I don't know what to do.
