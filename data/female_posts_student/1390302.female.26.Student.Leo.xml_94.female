I checked the status of his application online this afternoon and lo and behold it was accepted!  So those who know us can congratulate him on his successful entry into the world of the University student.  Matt is on the road to getting his bachelors degree, and it’s all because of ME!  Little ol’ me, without me he wouldn’t even have applied yet…LOL, just kidding, mostly!  Without his diligence and hard work through these years he wouldn’t be where he is. Three cheers for Matt… HIP, HIP, HORRAY!  To make things better, I just read online that Matt’s classification is Senior.  Matt has very little time before he’ll be able to get his bachelors degree!  GO MATT!  I am so proud of him, as I am sure you can tell.  The only problems that we’re having is that we’re going to have to go down to Stephenville so that Matt can do Departmental Advising with the Physics department, and so he can take a Composition Placement Exam.  Its roughly 80 miles so it’s no short drive, 160 miles round trip!  I hope we can get it all done in one day.  Maybe while we’re down there we can look for a place to live.    I also called to check on his Financial Aid and it is apparently on its way as well.  So Matt is now officially, or at the end of the summer will be officially, a Tarleton State University student, majoring in Physics and Mathematics.   I am so glad that his app and financial aid has been accepted.  It takes a huge load off of my mind.  Now, all I have to worry over is my own application.  Hopefully soon my application will come through.  At this point I would be just as relieved to hear that I didn’t get admitted, than that I did.  I hate to stress out and this is making me stress out!  College is a huge ordeal and I guess I just didn’t realize that it was going to be so much trouble before we began the applications process.  But, now that it’s almost over, I am pretty glad that we did it.  It seems like a huge problem, but it’s almost done and I feel great for having done it and kept up with the whole thing.  I did pretty much everything for both Matt and myself.  I am kind of the house businessperson.  I take care of all of the problems, the business, and the overall red tape.  It’s okay, that way I can keep my stress down and know what’s going on, because I take care of everything.   Well, that about exhausts my good news for the day.  I hope everyone is doing okay.  Regards to all!!!  ~Kristyn
