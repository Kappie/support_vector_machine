Do you ever try and look for old and farmiliar things, and then be disturbed when they're not there, or totally different? It sometimes freaks me a bit how sometimes things and even people can drop off the face of the earth; and you never hear from them again. Careers suddenly end, and someone fades into the irrecoverable past; someone decides to reinvent themself, and no connection to their prior identity remains.  But isn't a psychological chafing against this sort of transistory reality pure vanity? Everything changes... Sooner or later everything fades and is gone. The present moment is the precious incarnation of something that will never, ever, be here again, whether we like it or not.   And every time we look away, we take the chance that when we look back we will be made known to this fact of reality... That when we finally turn back and check, that thing finally will be gone forever, as it inevitably must, and will never be back again.   It's like the shape of a cloud that we spy for a moment drifting across the sky; look back, and it may be gone, and no cloud will ever be like it again. When we all look back on our lives, will that be how everything seems? Something that was there for just a brief moment and then is gone forever? A hundred years, even living thousands of years in memory, is as brief as a snapshot... Eventually everything will be consigned to the oblivion from which it emerged.   Is this a sad thing? Is it really unfortunate? Or does it give all the more meaning to the moments we experience each passing day? Each one is beautiful, unique, and will never come again. And it's because of that that is has meaning and purpose; that it's important. It's the most critical thing in the world to look around us and apprecciate this cloud for what it is, because once it fades, we'll never have it again. All we'll have is the feeling of emptiness that it once filled, as we look for something farmiliar and find it's not there.
