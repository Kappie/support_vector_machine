Studying for the last two weeks has been driving me crazy.  I've been "stealing" moments for myself.  I shouldn't have to steal moments to take a break!  I've been working 10-12 hours a day, and I still don't feel ready for this ridiculous test.  Yesterday was the straw that broke my back.  I woke up at 6am to take a practice test, and I did horrible.  Then I beat myself up.  Perfectionism is not for the weak-of-stomach.  Another thing is that I feel that I'm putting off everything.  I hate procrastinating, because it makes me *way* more stressed.  I like getting things done.  I hate having to tell myself, over and over and over, "This needs to wait until after the boards"  or "I can't think about this right now".  Do you know there are three separate defense mechanisms that involve putting off thought?  It's ridiculous.  I need to vent NOW.  I need to get it out NOW.    What am I putting off?  Well, the dad situation is around #1.  The fake dad situation is #2 (figuring out how to tell him and his mother that I'm not really a part of their family, but I really want to continue having a grandmother, just not a retarded father).  Getting a new shrink is #3.  Investing the emotional time and energy into finding a reasonable person who won't abandon me and who can deal with my special needs.  My last shrink's husband died, so she flaked out and basically abandoned me (the shrinks out there are probably nodding to themselves, full aware of "my special needs").  Jenny, maybe you can be a shrink...  So then I was ridiculous to Craig, drove him away, and convinced myself he didn't love me anymore.  The great thing about Craig is that he only stayed away for a little while, and then we went to wal mart.  Good husband.  Then we had a water fight outside in the backyard, because I've apparently needed to regress for the last month.  Wet and happy, I sat on the furniture to watch Star Wars Episode 4.  And ate lots of sugar free chocolate.  My cataracts will be arriving anytime now...  Yumm....sorbitol.
