Ended up that we met a new group of friends who invited us for another BBQ party the next day. Yeah, we were BBQed out! We had so much fun weekend, from jacuzzi to a game of taboo craziness. What's Taboo? Its like charade but instead of silence, you describe the word in a way so your group can guess the word. It was fun and boy we were crazy! Considering almost everyone was pretty buzzed out. The next day BBQ was done at another friend of mine, Krista's. And we got to stay and watch fireworks, which was a amazing.
