I did exactly what my body told me to do: I went straight to my bed and slept. Flash forward to parents arriving home and preparing dinner. While I was dreaming, my family had dinner without me. No announcement on the intercom, no coming up to wake me up for supper. So I wake up to discover my internet disconnected. Why? Because I slept through dinner. Gee, what a lovely surprise!*  Parents are so fucking irrational.  Aside from the shit that gets rubbed in my face at home, school isn't helping to lower my blood pressure or stress level. I really think I'm going to opt out for the Physics AP exam. Why waste my time on something I know I won't do well on? I'd prefer to focus on my other AP tests and do well in those areas instead. Plus, it's one less thing to stress over in my life. I'm already shitting bricks the size of SUVs. In addition to AP tests, I also have SATs to worry about (which I'm retaking in June), SAT IIs, a summer job, a summer camp to attend, scholarships, college, my GPA, and community service activities. Forgive me if I sound like a transcript junky.  Deviating from subjects related to academics, I'm excited for tomorrow--TGIF!! I'm probably going to buy tickets for the Mr. TPHS Dance. Matt and Insha, you must come along. I also think Leela, Annie, Rachel, and some others might tag along, too. I'm disappointed that there will only be two groups performing for Airbands because I've missed it every year until now due to coinciding swim meets. The one year I get to see it, nobody signs up for it. Too bad. But I'm sure the combination of the performances and the dance will be interesting.  On a final note: For  anybody  interested in seeing a spectacular, amazing, beautiful performance of the famous  Carmina Burana,  I have the date, time, and location available:  Sunday, May 2nd  at  7:00PM  at the JCC La Jolla. It's a very famous, renown piece by Carl Orff (if you care to download it at your disposal). The TPHS Wind Ensemble, String Orchestra, Choir, and AP Music Theory class will be performing it in one large group. Invite anyone you want, and get cultured!  *In case anybody is wondering how I made this post with my internet disconnected...my brother let me borrow his laptop with wireless internet.
