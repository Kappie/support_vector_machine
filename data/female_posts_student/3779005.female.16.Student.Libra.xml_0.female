I suppose it won't be very abitious, because it's my second one and it's not in my native language :) but I thought I could master my English :> I'm from Polnad (it's not in Asia... :P)and if you know Polish or just want to stare at "some letters" you can visit  urlLink little-ivy.blog.onet.pl  Something more about me will appear soon. And, if you are very bored and want to surf on the Net, visit also  urlLink evil_girl.blogspot.com  - that's my friend's blog :>
