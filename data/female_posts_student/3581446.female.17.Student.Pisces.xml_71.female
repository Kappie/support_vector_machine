     
       I had a blast today   Bought a new book, got compliments on one of my hawaiian shirts and my new backpack, had some good coffee, went to the library and read Le Monde, discussed Confucius and east asian culture outside my favorite coffeehouse, plus I got plenty of walking exercise!    The only bad part was lunch. I had some substandard Mongolian pork while overhearing some people argue loudly in Cantonese.  Wasn't too bad, though. The arguing reminded me of home...  -Theo
