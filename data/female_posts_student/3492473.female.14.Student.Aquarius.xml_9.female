A person has no control over how they feel inside. I mean, I guess you do. But deep down, you can tell your mind you don't like something, but really your heart decides whether it does or not... not you.  I just wish life wasn't so damn complicated...but as Margaret says, "what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger." But doesn't a person ever get scared  that it will kill them?  Oh well, I'm gonna go write some (Alex told me it would help me deal with my feelings...), maybe I'll post the stuff I write...good nite! sweet dreams~
