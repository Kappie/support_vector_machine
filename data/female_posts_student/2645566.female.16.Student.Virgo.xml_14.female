I didn't care about the school activities throughout the week. I didn't care about "spirit week." I just wanted to go to the game. And normally I wouldn't have cared. I just wanted to go because my friend is Queen!!! QUEEN!!! And I can't go...because I am sick. I mean, I even have friends that went tonight. And it wouldn't have been so bad if I didn't go because I had other plans. But no, that's not the case. I didn't go because of this crap.   I know that I will be up to my head in make-up work. I missed a good couple of tests, including a state-wide test that I don't know if I will get to make-up. I am really glad that it's not worse though. I mean, I could have had mono and Lord knows I am glad that that wasn't the case. Although, it was a good kick when I told Paul that I was planning on telling him that that was the case instead of the other stuff. I got a good laugh outta that. But I just wanna get better so I can spend time with my friends, actually go to school, and spend time with my boyfriend. Hopefully, I can get outta this jail tomorrow.
