Good times, today seemed rly rly long cuz I wuz so tired, I scanned only like 250 docs then I OCRed the entire time. I usually have a good lunch there but the girls I work w/ are like anorexic.... one has a salad sometimes and the other won't eat, and vice-versa.... or they both don't eat. It's kind of sick then makes me feel gross, u no how that is. But I guess I ignore it most of the time... But they're both rly nice girls. I'm taking my drive test this Saturday! I'm scurred.... lol. Then I have this dinner thing to go to that night to get acknowledged for being a "subject" and I dunno wut... lol. *sigh* I haven't seen like anybody this summer. Some ppl may be very suprised when they see me. Christina: I've cleaned up! lol. Work has done me over. (haha, it wuz all the nagging thatgot to me rly,I've just been stubborn)I got nice clothes, all high-neck shirts and stuff. Good 4 me? Yay perhaps? lol. Now I just need shoes.... lmao. But anywayz, I hope to get together soon w/ some ppl, as soon as that license rolls in yah? :-P And this thing, grrr... never posts for me on time, I don't understand. Hopefully this will this time. So I guess I'll talk 2 u guys later! Bye Bye! ~All Work  No Play
