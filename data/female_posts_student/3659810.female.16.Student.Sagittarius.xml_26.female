"Hi, how are you, oh thats good, wow isn't the weather lovely today" I can't stand it. I need to have a meaningful conversation. I makes me want to smash my head againt a brick wall. Oh of all the worlds i am stuck to reality in this nightmare of a place.  To stop myself from actually smashing my head into a brick wall i've had to meditate more meaning that i'm sort of floating on air right now.   Rhedyn "Nevermore"
