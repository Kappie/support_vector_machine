Just because it has the swirvy sign thingie doesnt mean it has to be 7 dollars.  And i really dont like those Louis Vuitton bags, they are for 400 dollars for a stupid LV.  I was watching the Simple Life with Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie and they had a Louis Vuitton suitcase! It was probably for 40,000 dollars or something..its insane. They dont even look nice...I realy dont like it.  I cant deny it but i hvae Triple 5 Soul..Its pretty, but some people have there whole closet full of that kind of junk.. And what does Juicy mean anyway.. I was loking in a store wiht my friend because we just wanted to see the prices and make fun of them and we saw a pair of pants and it said Juicy on the ass.  What is the point of that..Are they trying to ask us, "Is your ass Juicy?" Talk about boosting our self-esteem..
