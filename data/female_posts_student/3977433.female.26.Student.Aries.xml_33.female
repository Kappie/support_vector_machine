He got a bath today, after rolling around in some mud. He must have had fun.      I think I'm going to stick in a movie and hope that someone msg's me to take me away from this boredom. Tomorrow I doubt I'll be around much, I have some things to do, and that includes finishing my course.      Yesterday I ordered a bed set, but then today figured that I might not like it and cancelled it.. I then thought that maybe I'd like a quilt. But no...I went back to my first choice and re-ordered it. So it should be here on Friday or Saturday. Knowing my luck Monday they'll call.       Um, so yeah. SLeep tight everyone.
