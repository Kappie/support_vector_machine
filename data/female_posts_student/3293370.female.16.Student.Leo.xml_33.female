Well, I don't like arguing with wise women, but I beg to differ. Love is indeed love. But there is so much more to that word. Love is anything but simple, even when we try to make it so. Love is great and everyone should experience it in some shape or form at sometime during their life.   To me, love is a lot of things. Love is what you make of it. Love is smiling through the tears and seeing beauty where no one else will try to. Love is getting butterflies in your stomach from a single glance and being able to be yourself around that certain someone. Love is acceptance of the person, flaws and all. Love is a big risk with big consequences but also with bigger rewards. Love is not being able to live without the other person. Love is the willingness to give the relationship your all. Love is taking the jump because you have faith in the other person to catch you before you hit the ground. Love is a rollercoaster ride for the heart, and who doesn't love rollercoasters? Love is listening to the other person talk about nothing just to be able to hear the sound of their voice. Love is being able to say what you want to say because you know that won't change what the other person thinks of you. Love is being able to talk for hours about nothing. Love is arguing over the smallest things and then making up 10 minutes later. Love is sacrificing that last piece of pie, cake or that last candy to make the person happy. Love is amazing because when you see the person you love, you feel refreshed. You feel like a little girl with her first crush again because the butterflies never really go away. Love is when that person still makes you go all tingly and makes your brain turn to mush (haha). To me, all this, and so much more that I can't put into words, is love. I don't think there is one set definition for love. I mean there is; if you open any dictionary you'll see it. But I believe that love is what you make of it and what you make it out to be. Each person defines love in their own way and according to their own morals. This is my definition of love. Accept it if you would like, and if not, that's ok too. This definition will probably change somewhat as I grow and learn, but right now, these are the words I put to the ineffable feeling.  I've defined love as all these great things, but I'm still afraid of it. Well, I'm not afraid of love as much as I'm afraid of what comes from it. The heartache and the pain that love causes is something I would like to put off for as long as possible. However, I also want to put myself out there and experience love without holding back. This is where the problem lies: I want to love and be loved but I don't want to face the consequences. Now I just can't win. There can't be one without the other, and I know this, yet I still try to find a way around the whole hurting part. Someday though, I have faith that a truly amazing guy will come and sweep me off my feet and bring out the little girl in me. The little girl who was more than ready to try anything and throw herself into something without looking back. Maybe that day isn't too far off ...
