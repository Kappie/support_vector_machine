The second I walk into Science this morning I get my lab partner Gabe screaming across the room at me. "ANGELA! I haven't seen you for weeks! Speak to ME!" God, I'm missing for one day and evidently people think I've died. Oh well, I sat down and we actually argued over where I'd been on Monday. I was in class, he disagreed and Mrs. C had to step in. Good Lord... Apparently Gabe had been absent the week before winter break and had missed a major test which he had to make up this morning. This was a bit of a problem because some people I know from our academy were gathering around to speak to me. Helen, Kaeli and Brienna were standing around our table chattering about something and Gabe was screaming at them to shut up. The struggle went on for several minutes before we shut up and stared at each other. Of course, Sophal decided this was the  perfect  time for his entrance and ran over singing at the top of his lungs. Gabe started yelling at Sophal for "screwing him over" and forcing him to get a crap grade. Mrs. C had to intervene once again.  Ms. N AKA Satan attempted to touch me in Health. She seemed to think it was a friendly pat on the back but the thought of having IT touch me nearly made me cry. You do not understand how insane this woman is, she acts like she has some sort of mental disorder. She can go from normal-ish person to madman in a matter of seconds. She has occasional screaming fits with herself, even.  I was even more frightened when she asked me to stay after class, thankfully it was only inform me of a new essay and not to kill/maim/eat/hug me...
