For the last few weeks, we have had a lot of fun discussing women issues, relationships, the impact of media, women role models, etc. But this time, I would like to propose something a little different.  First:  Each one of you should bring a baby or kid picture of yourself. Then, you need to present us a passion that you have, a book that you read, or an activity that you do and that the other girls don't really know about.  I think it would be a great way to solidify our bonds =)  By the way, the Collection manager told us he would do any Martini we want, who knows, we might even be able to negotiate a discount hihi!  Hope to see you all Tuesday and tonight (Friday) at our little potluck party.
