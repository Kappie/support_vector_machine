Believe me it was hard not to freak...    It is said that the images of eyes watching you as you wander through the forest is one of a warning of the evil that is to come. Eyes watching you, eyes of wild beasts, of monsters, following you as you wander. I close my eyes and i see it, two eyes glaring back at me, still in a distance but then they come closer and closer.... this is how it usually ends, i will open my eyes put the radio on and try to think of other things. However last night i reached a new point, one that sends a chill down my back to recall it. My face is still  wet from tears i refuse to wipe away as a definance to something inside my soul telling me to be ashamed of them. I lie in the silence, the darkness consuming me. Still and silent. Then behind my eyelids an image forms...from a black dot it grows into two distant eyes. I watch as they get closer and fear grips me but i will not give in. I flutter my eyes open before closing them to this image. One eye, the right eye, is glaring at me and it is the first time i see it properly and i chills me to the bone. It is wide, without eyelashes, and it glares. The colour of the iris is blood red and the eyeball itself is bloodshot, like some poor murder victim. The pupil dialates and it moves closer to me.    It is at that point i open my eyes wide and turned the radio on, willing for the meaningless melody to sooth me.. I would wake each time the radio would turn itself off, pressing the snooze button again, dozing until it turned itself off. The silent creatures of the night scare me as though i were a child again, only now these images are more grotesque. And like a child i will fight them...   ~ Aine    urlLink www.pain182.blogspot.com
