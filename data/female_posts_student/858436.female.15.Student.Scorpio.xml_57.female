English has come up a ton, but "we're only worrying about physics and geometry."  Of course the good things go unnoticed. Why should the odds be for me? The world is pissed off at me. I don't know what I did wrong, but everything has decided to turn around. I feel like I'm no longer in control, and these 2 imbeciles are trying to fix things they don't know shit about.  Today I get home, and I'm not even home 20 minutes before I'm crying. I cried my eyes out yesterday, and I cried some more today. I don't think I've cried so much since my grandfather died. 4 months of angst and anguish have been released, and it's relieving yet scary at the same time.  Tonight I decided to start working on my theology paper, since I have nothing else to do. I go to our little library den thing, and start looking for a book because there are half a million in there on the shelves. My father buys all these weird off the wall books that are probably out of print now, so some we kind of interesting really. Then I found this one book that had nothing to do with religion but interested me. I sound pathetic guys, but on a Friday night, I was reading a psychology book. It was pretty confusing but cool. There was this quiz in the front with a million questions that gives you your personality type. I am an INFJ. It stands for some stuff, but I forgot. I read my description, and it was scary how much it matched me.   It says that INFJs like writing and make phenomenal psychiatrists and therapists, which is what I want to be. It went into detail about the type of person I am, and it was so exact. My personality only makes up 1 percent of the population, so it's really rare. Haha I'm awesome. And people who are so called psychics are INFJs and people who have ESP are always INFJs. Awesome, so maybe I'm psychic too.   I'm going to lose my mind this weekend, guys. Being here alone with a bunch of people who hate me. Virginia and I have been getting along tonight, so at least someone around here likes me. I have made minimal conversation with my parents. I don't even look at them. This isn't all just because I'm grounded. It's because I am so damn frustrated with all this shit they are giving me. Making me miserable is not going to encourage me. What kind of parenting is this? This whole afternoon I was just completely numb. And you know what my mother asks? "Well, what are you all upset about?" What a dumbass. If you have to ask, you probably don't deserve to know.  I hate how one day everything can be perfect and the next everything is horrible. This time last week, I was with friends having an awesome time. 4 days later, I'm bawling my eyes out and it really hasn't stopped all week. Every day this week has been something. Someone telling me that I'm not good enough. I guess I'm just a class A loser, and I need to accept it.
