It is important to note that I do not know Ethan personally and and, as much as I wish I did know them, I do not know the Zohn family personally either, so I can't get autographs for anyone no matter how much people cuss me out or how much grinding and gnashing of teeth people do. I would like people to keep in mind of this.  Ethan Zohn was the million dollar winner of Survivor: Africa.  He beat out Kim Johson, a retired school teacher from N.Y., for the million dollar prize  Kim Johnson won the two hundred and fifty thousand dollar booby prize for coming in second place.  Ethan is making it known to millions in his adoring public that he and Jenna Morasca, the 22 year old swimsuit model and Survivor: The Amazon winner from Pittsburg, PA, are indeed dating and that's all I can say about since I don't know much else about it and the couple have said nothing else about it.     I would like to stress that this blog is a rumor free zone so I don't want to see any gossip or rumors about whether or not Ethan and Jenna are more than just friends.
