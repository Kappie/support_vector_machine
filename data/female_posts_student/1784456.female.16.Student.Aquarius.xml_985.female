That might explain the hyperness... that and the fact that I've had ice-cream for the past three days running!  urlLink http://www.fanfiction.net/profile.php?userid=208461  Wow.. in my hyper state I wrote a poem about being paranoid... not that I know *cough cough cough* Hehe... any way it's kind of good I guess, people have actually been reviewing my poetry! :O All of my *actual* poetry is in the back of my diary though, but no one gets to see it cause it's all crap. :D I guess that's why it's in my diary... hehe! Seriously, for me the back of all my class books, diary etc are all way more filled than the front! Weird huh? (No, just a bit back to front deerie) Hey! Don't you insult then deerie me... deerie! (Go write poetry) Deal. I'll go type some up so I can have a FIVE MILE RADIOUS! WOw! (And maybe learn how to spell) Wow! ...Wait a sec, that takes brain power! NEVER!
