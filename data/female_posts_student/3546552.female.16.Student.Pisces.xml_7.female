Florida was wonderful, but after seeing a cockroach on the floor the night before we left...well let's just say that I was done. I got home on Thursday around 1:30 in the afternoon and went home to do laundry after taking Michelle and Alice home. Then, I got ready to go again, and went to church to see off my friends leaving on the missions trip to El Salvador. I gave M.R. his pen and carribeaner (sp?), and everyone else their sea shells. I am sad that MR is leaving for 10 days, but somehow I will survive *wink*. Meanwhile, I had my cousin over for a girl movie night and then we went to her sister's graduation party, which was a complete success, considering there was no rain, and it was neither blazing hot nor icy cold! Tomorrow is Father's day, and I am spending it with my mom...how wierd is that?! I am excited to be home, but I miss all of my friends that are gone...esp...well, you know...hehe. I hope to hear from you soon if possible, and if not, I will continue to pray for you and think about you all the time. ~kendra
