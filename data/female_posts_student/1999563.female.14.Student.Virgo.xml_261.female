Then, during spanish Aaron (this is for you Mandy) came in to do a project with Eric and Marc and since eric sits next to me Aaron pulled up a chair and sat right next so me. And he was like "Its SOO cold in here" So I pulled out my hot tea and it was steaming in my face, it felt nice. Spanish is always so cold- i come prepared.  So he was like drooling over my warmness. Then, he goes "Laaauuurrraaa, I can I wear your mittens?" an di was like "Um...okayy." So he was like, I was just joking!! Pink doesn't look good on me... There movie was interesting.  They did the three little pigs. But, at the end aaron played a switchfoot song so I was happyyyy!  EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! They are playing the BARLOW GIRL SONG ON THE RADIO!!!! Te ehhehehe  Not, barlow girls by superchick BarlowGirl the band.  I had to clear things up.  Its an AWEEESOME song  Ya'll have to buy it in FEBRUARY!  So...I went to piano Gosh, she hates me!  It was so scary! I acctually knew my song this time and she got so mad at me when  I didn't mess up..yeah...it was inttterrrresttting.  Then my grandparents came over. Yeah, my poor grandma, her memories really gone. :(  She thought it was christmas.  Then I typed up my hours for my performing arts and PE credits and I have enough in both!! *woot*  dude!! My dad is making a new thing for our tv cuz it is to big for our old one. And liek allllday I have been like high off of the fumes. Haha.  Whenever I go into the living room I get so dizzy I almost fall over, its funny.  Brain CELLS! ACK! there go all my brain cells, buh bye!  I made the coolest away message today! The whole time I was just making ufn of myself cuz I always have my away message on, so here it is: Don't you just hate it when people ALWAYS have there away message on? Gosh, it bugs me sooo much!! I always want to talk to these people but they are never on!! They always have these messages like "Call me, babe :-*" And I am like..okkayy. No thanks. Or they say "I am babysitting." DO I really care if your babysitting? My goodness. First, and foremost I would like to say TURN OFF AWAY MESSAGES! If you really want to develop a relationship with me then we need to talk to eachother. Second: I hate being called babe!! Why can't you call me like "superstar" or something? Geeeez! Second, why can't you put an inspiring quote or something? Maybe something that will helpy me gain something, like knowledge! I prefer quotes like this:"If you judge someone you have no time to love them" Mother Teresa Thank you.Well, now I am probably changing the world, luv ya babe! ;-)    Hahaha! Isn't that sue-wheat!!  OH!!  Tomorrow in the wee hours of the morning I get to go to KRISPY KREEME! With just my mom! I am gonn aget a dozen and bring them to school.
