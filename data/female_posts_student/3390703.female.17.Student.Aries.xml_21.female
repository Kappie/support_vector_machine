Ashleigh is mad at me because I gave Kyle stuff to do and I did it with him and because I ditched her for him!  Ok, I did not ditch her!  She was with Amanda and they have there "Twin" bonding shit going on and I did not want to be apart of that!  It's not like I left her alone, she had Amanda with her!  I think I now understand how Ashleigh felt when I was supposedly stealing Emily?, Jesi, Rachel? away from her!  (Even though she still talks to ALL of them, and I only talk to Rachel!)  I'm not going to watch her steal Amanda away from me, I mean right infront of me!  So I hung out with Kyle!  And you know what, I had tons of fun!  Because ... we talked, a lot and I've never talked to him that much in my life!  I liked it a lot!  Ahh, and then she said that I ditch her for Kyle all the time and that is so not true!  The last time I hung out with her (like a sleepover over there) was Spring Break and both the nights I slept over she had Joe come over, and they basically kicked me out of their room!  So it's not like I was going to sit in the hallway alone, I hung out with Kyle!  Is there anything wrong with that?  NO!  Is that ditching her?  NO!  It's more like she is ditching me for Joe!  Ok, not really!  But it does seem like Joe is the only thing in the world that she cares about!  I mean we get into fights and she tels me that she doesn't care, which is bullshit because if she doesn't care then she shouldn't have started anything in the first place!  AHh, and then last night she tells me that I'm the one that "acts" like I don't care about anything and we all know that is a lie!  If its not a big deal to me then I don't even bring it up, I forget about it because why start problems for no reason?  But if I do care, and I ALWAYS CARE WHEN IT COMES TO ASHLEIGH AND I MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR WHEN I TALK TO HER, then I talk about it!  And thats why I fight with her about it because I don't want her to think I don't care!  I want her to tell ME how she feels so then I can try to change!  I know I'm not a perfect person, I know I make mistakes and that I might be a little brain dead at times, but I'm not the only one!  Ashleigh has her problems too, EVERYONE does!  I was supposed to go to Jamnesty with Lori, Frank, Ryan, and Karina to see Bob's band play, but my mom turned into a major bitch and called me while I was at Ryan's house and made me cry very bad and made me come home!  And then when I got home she kept lecturing me about why I was crying, and the only reason is because she kept yelling at me, and I really wanted to see Bob's band play because I love Bob and yeah, it makes me happy to see him!   So instead I went to Charlotte's surprise party and it was a lot of fun!  More fun then I thought it would be!  First we went to Village Pizza and then we went to the movies to see Shrek 2!  It was a really funny movie!  Oh, I love Sally, Amanda, and Devin so much!  They make me so happy!  Yay!  I was going to have a sleepover with all of them at my house and then go to Sally's church with them in the morning, but that didn't happen because Sally and Amanda's mom said no and Devin couldn't sleepover unless Amanda slept over!  During the movie Rachel and Brittany kept calling me, but I had to hang up on them because I was watching a movie and when I did try to talk to them I couldn't hear them!  SO DON'T THINK I WAS HANGING UP ON YOU TO BE A BITCH, I JUST COULDN'T TALK AT THE MOMENT!  So when the movie was over I called them back and they started to bitch at me for giving Kyle stuff and ditching Ashleigh for Kyle so I told them that I would call them back later, because I didn't want to fight with them infront of everyone!  When I got home they called me and they yelled at me, and lectured me and told me what a bad friend I am to everyone and how I tell everyone they are my best friend, but in reality I talk shit about all of them behind there backs!  So I hung up on them, because I was already in a depressed mood because of my mom and I just didn't want to hear it anymore because I knew that I was going to cry if I listened anymore!  Then I texted Rachel and told her that I needed to talk to her, and only her because Brittany has nothing to do with any of this!  Rachel told me that she was mad at me about the Kyle thing because if I cared about him then I wouldn't do that because it's going to hurt him!  Well, my problem is that I can't say no to him!  I know he would have understood if I said no, but I didn't want to!  I want Kyle to like me (as a friend) and I guess I'll do anything to keep it that way, I don't want to ruin that in any way!  But I know what I did was wrong, and I can assure everyone that I won't do it again because I do care about Kyle and I don't want people to be mad at me!  Then she told me that she was mad at me because I ditch her for Amanda all the time!  That is so not true!  And I thought we talked about this like a month ago!  Yes, I know we talked about it because we were buying food and I pulled her aside to tell her I was so sorry if she felt that I liked Amanda more than I like her because that isn't the truth!  I love Rachel so much more than I could ever even think about loving Amanda!  Rachel means so much to me and I don't know what I would do without her!  Amanda was like my new toy that I wanted to play with all the time because she was new to me, but I realized that NOTHING can ever replace the old!  Because they are the ones that are always gonna be here for you!  And Rachel told me she was fine with it, and we never talked about it again so I thought everything was ok!  And then I month later she decides to bring it up!  She told me that she couldn't tell me the truth to my face, ... so she waited a MONTH to tell me on the phone because that is so much better!  If you have a problem with something I'm doing then she needs to tell me about it right away, not wait this long!  Because now it is OLD news!  I barely ever talk to Amanda anymore, so what is the point of talking about it now?  ... Hmm, there is no point!  Because it is over and done with!  I'm glad that she told me about it, but there is no need to start a fight over it!  Oh yes, and then she made a point to tell me that she is sick of the way I'm treating Ashleigh!  Ok, Rachel is only hearing one side of all of these stories, so she really can't say anything because she doesn't know first hand what is going on!  I know she loves Ashleigh, I love Ashleigh too, more than you could ever imagine and I don't purposely do these things to hurt her!  DUH, I'm not a heartless person, I do feel bad and I try to not do it again, but I guess I just mess up a lot! Ahhh, and Brittany, none of this has to do with her!  She is long gone, out of my life!  I wish it wasn't like that, but it is ... so she has no right to be judging the things that I do!  She is just as bad as me!  She talks shit about Rachel, her BEST FRIEND, Rachel has said shit about her!  We all do it once in awhile!  We are NOT perfect people, none of us are!  ... I'm not forcing any of them to be friends with me!  So if they have so many problems with me they need to learn to talk to ME about it, when it happens, not weeks or even days later, RIGHT AWAY ... or they can just stop being friends with me!  Because I don't need friends that are constantly getting pissed off at me and fighting with me!  That's why I love Lori, Amanda, and Sally so much!  Because they don't fight with me!  They don't start problems, we have good relationships because we all TALK to each other and tell each other how we are feeling!  Because that's what friends do, they talk to each other about things so then the other person can try to work on it!  And friends are understanding, they realize that nobody is perfect, we all have our problems, we all have our mistakes, but none of us would ever intentionally do soemthing to hurt someone else!  The End!
