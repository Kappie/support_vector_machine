I woke up at 7 and then fell asleep and woke up again at 9. I showered and then got ready. I went to my mom's friend's house to help them bring a couch to where they live. After that I went to some moving truck place. I guess it's almost like "U-Haul" but it's called "Penske", well yeah I went there to go drop off a truck because my cousin and her boyfriend and kids came from North Carolina to visitor something, I don't know but they brought a moving truck with all there stuff and everything, so yeah. Then we went to Lotaburger and came home and ate. Then my cousin and her boyfriend left to get an oil change for their Caddy or Cadillac. And I stayed home and watched the kids. But it kinda sucked because my allergies started acting up and it started around 12 and it went all down hill from there. I took some allergy pills. It said Day-Time Allergy Relief or something like that. So I thought it wasn't supposed to make you drowsy but I guess it did...or well it made me. I was watching Shrek with my little cousin and I kept falling asleep. I kept thinking her mom would walk in the door any second. But my allergies went away. So that was nice. Then I went outside to play with my cousins and came back in because mosquitos were starting to bite me. I guess I'm just juicy...just kidding..haha. Anyways, I watched a little bit of Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune... Around 7 my cousins left to go see my other relatives. Baby-sitting was alright. The kids weren't bad...they listened and I got payed $20, so that was good. Yup. Matt called me earlier this evening...at like 9:45...well I guess at night..lol but something was wrong with him because he sounded a bit down. He wouldn't tell me why. I don't know but it's weird talking to him, because like he always says things to me and I start thinking he likes me..which he probably doesn't. Oh geez..it's sooo confusing. Why are guys confusing? But he would say stuff like....fine..and I would say fine...and he says...yeah I know you are....and I could tell by what he means...I mean it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out. Or he would say, something like...yeah really?...and I say yeah...really..and he'll say..wow you're really pretty..and then he'll say something else real fast..to cover it up. It's like he doesn't come out saying it...but he does it all secretly...it's tough to explain...but I hope you're getting me. And then I'm supposed to be getting a call from my friend but I don't know what's up with her. She and her ex-boyfriend are talking again and I kinda get the feeling like they're going to get back together, even though she says she won't. Because he treats her like crap and she knows it....it just bothers me a lot though. Well I guess I better get going now...Bye!
