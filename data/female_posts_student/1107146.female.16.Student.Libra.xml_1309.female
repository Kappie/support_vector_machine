I might be acting bitter, biased, or just plain bitchy, but she brought this on herself.  Really.  And with all the AP's she's taking next year, I wouldn't be that surprised if she started feeling like that.  That's why I'm never taking that many AP's.  So if she mopes about it, she can get over it.  I am really sorry if that offends anyone or makes them think ill of me, but that's how I feel and you know that normally I'm pretty blunt.  I'm in one of those antagonistic, vindictive moods tonight.    Anyway, is it okay if I come with you guys to Renfest, Linds and Josh and aren't you going, Abby?  Linds I know doesn't have a problem.  I will need a ride, though.  If that's cool, fine, and if not, fine.  I'm going on Sunday anyway, so... ;)  But I would like to come with you guys.  I know we'd have a good time.    As for the cleaning thing...I don't ever do that...;)  ~Z
