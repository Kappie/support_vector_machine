I'm sure it's fine *boom/spontaneous combustion* I just put two pictures on mal's blog through my HTML genius. yes. or not whatever. Ok so we had this little like health lecture whatsit yesterday about like sex and marraige. Of course we (the girls) get the, "You'll get pregnant you ignorant slut" speach. While the guys get the "um yeah whatever man, just don't...i don't care really..." speach. Yeah this woman was like "ok close your eyes and imagine that your walking into a room with the guy of your dreams, the room is great, it has anything you'll ever need, this room is marraige. Now you walk into the room and the door vanishes behind you, you have no way out. what are your thoughts." PRISON! wow really sellin' it there hun. yeah the whole time she's like "marraige is great, but it sucks ass" the whole feeling i got from her was like cynical bitterness. haha. yeah well. Um really nothing else interesting is happenin' only 19 days of school left i think. 19 or 20 ish. thank GOD. oh right yesterday I started on the pottery wheel and like got clay ALL over my legs, it was insane. Also i managed to um not make anything on the wheel despite my desperate attempts, it was just terrible. haha, all good fun though.
