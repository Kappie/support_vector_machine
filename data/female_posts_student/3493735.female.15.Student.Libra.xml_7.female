Well last week at camp was awesome....even though there were only a few people there haha...it was good to hang out with Katy Walton and mallory Fisk they are  awesome people and Bobby came to visit.....i have a lot of witnessing to do....i've come to realization that i haven't been doing my work for Christ the way i should be and i haven't been setting the best example for my non Christian friends and i've noticed that b/c they kinda walk all over me and use me for whatever they can get out of me and drain me and when I am with them i don't act like a Christian....so i need prayer...i need to become a better witness to my non Christian friends this year at school and i need to date if and/or when i date, date a good Christian guy with strong morals and good standards. I know in the past i've slipped up a bit and fell on my face when i don't stick to what i need to in my walk with Christ and it is all coming to catch up with me....Bobby knows about this and quite possibly the only one who will ever know besides God and of course the people tht were involved....i have foresaken my king and Lord.....i need to want and desire him to always be in my life and heart...i'm strugling and being tempted by things and people....please pray that i don't fall into temptation like i have in the past...please help me to stand strong for my king and the lover of my soul. "You are the lover of my soul, Jesus i will never let you go." that's part of a song.   HUNGRY -title of the song....(i want to live this and have people be able to see this through me!) Lord I want more of you, living water rain down on me. Lord i need more of you, living breath of life come fill me up. We are hungry, we are hungry, we are hungry for more of you. We are thirsty, oh Jesus, we are thirsty for more of you, more of you. We lift our holy hands up, we want to touch you. We lift our voices higher and higher and higher to you.  if you would please don't ask me what happened in my past....if i want you to know i'll let you know....thanks  over and out TORI
