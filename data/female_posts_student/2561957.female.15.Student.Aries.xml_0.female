Anyways, I'm finally back home. I shouldn't be mad at Paul, because we're not even together anymore. But I am. Well, it's not really anger, just massive disappointment. Maybe that's worse than anger. I don't know.      I stayed up last night until 3:30 AM talking to him on the phone. That's not as bad as it sounds, since I said I'd call him at around 1 AM.      I love him. I can't help myself. On my old blog, I recorded 20-something reasons why I love him. Maybe I'll do that again on this one some day. Maybe I won't. It might actually make him feel worse if I did that. Perhaps it's best that I deleted my old blog, because if he'd reread any of my old reasons, he might have felt even worse about this week than he already does - which, if you knew him, is pretty hard to imagine.
