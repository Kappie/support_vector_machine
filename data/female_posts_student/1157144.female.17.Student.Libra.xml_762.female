This is the ultimate dancing song, seriously...effin' love this song, and I have been listening and dancing to it for like the past 35 minutes, it's so great.   (>^_^)>   Oh man, such good stuff...and yeah, just want to let people know I'm doing a lot better now. I made an estimate, and I'd say I'm 88.6% back-to-normal now - or just for Billy, I can say 88 and 5/6% better. ~_^  And yeah, you guys, seriously, thanks for being such awesome friends and whatnot. You've all made me feel so much better just by letting me spend time with you all, and it warms my heart so very much. So thank you. ::hellsa group hug::  And duuuuude, if people aren't too tired after Berkeley, then we seriously have to par-tay tonight, 'cuz me and Barry White need to get out and boogie. ~_^
