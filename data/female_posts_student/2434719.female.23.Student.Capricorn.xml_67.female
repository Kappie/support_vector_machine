IT'S TRADITION, YA KNOW there were a few YEARS where three great girls would email eachother every sunday evening (or um, monday morning... or errr, wednesday afternoon). anyways, i'm continuing the tradition this week into my blog, cause i don't know what else to talk about. :)  FRIDAY: crap this is hard to remember. errr oh YES.  well, kentesheia had stayed over the previous night, and that morning i made breakfast for her and my mom. i think they enjoyed it, it was a new recipie but it still turned out alright (it's a step away from scrambly surprise). then um, we did pilates? crap what else. ooooh so i planned a nice evening cause my dad was out of town, and i knew my mom would want to hang out with us.  so i made dinner (and surprised the two of them of how good food can be without meat!), and rented along came polly.  may i say, that movie is hysterical. there were so many things in there that were reflective of my life it was in INSANE.  only kentesheia will get any of them, but regardless, it was there. :)  SATURDAY: woke up. ate. napped. the world was as it should be. i made some lunch for me and ken... then i took her back home, and stopped by danny's to see jason (in from OK)and give him our pictures from california. THORSTEN BOUGHT A HAMMOCK. i havn't been able to stop thinking about it, honestly.  AND DANNY MADE A BLOG.  that gets its own line. :) after that, i came and visited with my friend vannessa, whom (i have a degree in  who vs whom  and i still don't have a damn clue) i hadn't seen in a while. it was nice to catch up, and talk about her wedding plans. my dress is ready, i need to go pick it up. yay! AND THEN... i talked to my buddy andrew, and he said he was having some people over and invited me to come over. he doesn't live too far from newmy, and i knew she was up for something so i picked her up and we went on our way. it was cool to meet new guys and hang out and what not. then i came home early in the am and watched a movie, and then passed out.  SUNDAY: woke up, worked out, shopped, and then now, i write my blog and wait for the kids to come over.  i'm making them my special pizzas! and w'ere playing games... no swimming cause it's pouring outside though.  AND THEN... game four bitches!
