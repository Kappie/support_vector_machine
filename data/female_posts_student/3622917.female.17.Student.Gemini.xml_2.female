I just liked the lyrics in the song. Go death cab for cutie. Of course it will likely turn out that the song isn't actually talking about that but whatever. I am allowed to have my silly little thoughts whenever I feel so inclined.  Kirsti was over today! No more isolation! It was nice and weird at the same time to have someone else around. No offense meant it was just the first time in a realllly long time that anyone has stopped in for longer than an hour. Or in the psychologists case a little more than an hour. I wonder if you have to pay  extra if he stays for longer than one hour. I don't really care. I would prefer to never ever ever have to see him again but we all know that thanks to my darling mummy I will have to make a return visit. But I have held her off awhile longer using my I-can't-be-bothered-to-get-up-that-early excuse. Long live mono. Just not in me. By the way, Tyler/Kandis I AM NOT A MONOFACE!! Okay maybe I am but its not nice to point out others faults! Jokes. All jokes. The phone will not stop ringing. First it was my dad. Which was nice. He gets to watch a movie tonight. But sadly, it is Along Came Polly which we watched about a million times the week before he left. I miss him so much. "I need you so much closer" ~transatlanticism. Then it was Star Records in Oshawa calling because my brother's Tiger Army thing came in. I don't really care but whatever. Then some friend of my parent's called. Why do people call but never for me? It must just be a thing. Oh well. Kirsti and I watched part of School of Rock. That movie is so funny. Well in its own little way it is.  Thinking of lyrics, I think that Transatlanticism by Death Cab for Cutie is the prettiest song ever. Its just so nice. Plus I could probably play the piano part. I'm also liking, whatsit, um, Televators by the Mars Volta. Right, thank you Tyler! And screw you sibling, I can like the same music as you if I want to. And sometimes I do. So come on. Riddle me this... Rhymes with Lackey Down (two words, Quentin Tarantino). Good freaking luck. It is tricky.  We also conquered Candyland today. Or at least the shareware version. Rainbows all around. The cute crows and scary gigantic spider. But we are the masters of rainbow death madness! Or at least Kirsti is. I am like a master in training. And walked into the angry sea and it felt just like falling in love again. How true. Anyway, I grow tired of typing and really just being tired. But I still am. Once again I am posting a very short little post. I am sorry. But the days seem to interfere with my having no life and being on here all the time. As of Monday morning though it is back to normal for the week, anyway. And on Friday, I have Lore's dance thingy. And sometime near the end of next week Laura and I are hitting the movies. Harry Potter here we come! I think Kirsti is coming too. Very exciting cause I haven't seen Laura in well maybe by now its years. Time does fly when you are having a ...Well, time flies. Whatever. Good night Ladies and Gents! Or rather good evening! Good something anyway.
