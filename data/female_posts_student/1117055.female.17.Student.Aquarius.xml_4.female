Anyway, these pictures really dont capture how beautiful this is, behind every little arch there's more arches and broken collumbs (how on earth do you spell that?)  This town was awesome, as we were walking along (or maybe it was the next town?) anyway, these kids threw glass bottles at us!  really close to us!  I felt unwanted.  But who cares, this place was so awesome I wanted to become a photographer just so I could do a photoshoot of this place.  Which I sort of did, with my crappy disposable camera and the help of one Miss Alice Hsieh.
