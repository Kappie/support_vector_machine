Guam time or something... but its okay, Melissa, Morgan, Simione, and Stasi are there so its all good. I'm in a few classes with people too, Alex is in a bunch and so is Stasi. Also, Melissa and Danielle are in my homeroom so yay! lol... So after orientation we (Me, Mariana, Debra, Danielle, Marina, Erica, Stasi, Simione, John, and Dave) went to Andrews Diner, Dave picked us up. It was fun, I had a BLT club and it was huge! Then, I came home, went to track, and then came home and got ready for everyone tocome over. It was mad fun. We watched John's tapes of him lighting fireworks and peeing, and taking a shit... it was.... well it was different... entertaining but different. Then, we played truth or dare... and we'll just fast forward here... After that we watched the "Shrek in the Swamp Kariokie Dance Party" and then we switched the movie to "Mouse Hunt"... good times good times... I think the jr. boys are like so awesome. They are just all like so funny and so cool and you can't hang out with them without something funny happening... they are just.. awesome I dunno. But... yea... tomorrow will be.. well it will be tomrrow lol... I don't have anything to do really so we'll see where things go. Deb and I are supposed to go to the city w/ Vallillo and some people so... we'll see. Alrite that's it... much love XOXOXO
