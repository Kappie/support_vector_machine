The products we purchase are the inventory of our lives. To chain stores, this inventory is cataloged through the Universal Product Locator symbol (UPC). The UPC symbol is known as a barcode. Barcodes are now found everywhere in our world, extending outside of product inventory into our comic books, our science fiction, our films, and even our tattoos.   Our  tattoos ?    In typical transaction scenarios, both consumer and cashier behave accordingly to accommodate the dominance of the barcode. Both depend on the accuracy of the code.   By which I think they mean: the clerk scans it, and I stand there waiting for all the items to be scanned. I usually watch the screen, which shows a running total. Sometimes the Barcode isn't right - and rebel that I am- I point this out. As Lileks said, "I realize that this is a dangerous path, and I may well end up in a prisoner--pyramid at Gitmo with a leash around my neck and a flashlight up my rectum, but you have to take a stand. Sometimes the code for avocados is out of date, and if means John Ashcroft will appear in a cloud of red smoke, drag you off to the backroom and beat your kidneys with phone books until you piss blood, then so be it."   Both function in machine-like behaviors in accordance to the patterns of traditional consumption rituals.   You are "engaging in a pattern of traditional consumption rituals." Right. Here I was thinking I was just buying some orange juice.  What must it be like to live your day seeing everything through the prism of this tiresome horseshit? I’m SHOPPING FOR DINNER, fool, and I am not functioning in a machine-like behavior.   In some situations, even the cashier has been removed, so a machine can now be controlled by only the barcode maneuvered by human hands.   Um - sure. Why the hell not?   but take tactical action to manipulate the existing system for consumer benefit. With RE-CODE.COM, we look for a way to highlight the absurdity of a system undermined by humans that relies primarily on our very own physical presence and continual acceptance. We must showcase the human through the subversion of the code.    And Neo gasps as the cortical unlink is crudely yanked from his head. I love this line: “the absurdity of a system undermined by humans that relies primarily on our very own physical presence and continual acceptance.” Do you grasp the piercing insight here? The stunning revelation?   We're all just sheep.   Okay. I got this ball rolling. Now it's  your  turn. I'm interested in your thoughts.
