The wake is twice the size and the boat is twice as fast. we took turns and we got some really good whip and some really great waves. Sami caught the most air out of all of us. I never fell off, Jenny almost stayed on the whole time except Chad decided to whip them really hard and dumped all four of the tubers. Our cousin Paige is also out, dad inveted her to hang out with Amanda because she is living with our grandma now. I think she's going to stay here for a while because she's having fun. Oh eyah, Sami and Amanda got in a huge fight that only lasted for about 20 minutes and now their friends again. I guess Amanda let Sami borrow her belt and accidentaly left her towel on the floor after swimming. Amanda got mad at her telling her that she never picks her towels up, so Sami, being the joker called her a "bitch" and Amanda took it seriously and took her belt back and then neither one wanted to apologize so I had to hear both sides and solve it. Of course I chose Sami's side because she is the sweetest girl and would never do anything rude to her friends, Amanda on the other hand, does things she doesn't notice. She acts rude to people and doesn't even think about it. I'm kind of like that too we jsut can't help it. Oh well, it happens to the best of us.
