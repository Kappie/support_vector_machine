Some people come in and out of your life for a period of time and mean more to you then people you've known half your life.  Others only pop in once and leave an impression on your heart that lasts a life time.  None are any better then the other, they just are what they are.  There are also those that give your life meaning, the one's that make your heart hurt when you don't talk everyday, that freind that makes everything different when she/he is not around; the sun doesn't shine the same and something is just not right.  Regardless of your friend "position" (for lack of a better word) in life each person that contributes makes me who I am today.  I am humbled by the fact that I have any of these relationships to speak of.   I don't really know where I'm going with this entry I guess mostly I was just thinking how grateful I am that I have people in my life to share happy things with.  It warms my heart to know that you are there, to each of you that reads this, thank you for being my friend and sharing your lives with me regardless of how often we actually make memories...
