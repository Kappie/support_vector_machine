There are good things and bad things about being a girl, and it sucks cause there is nuthin really bad about being a boy when u think about. But nooooooo there had to be alot of things bad, i mean girls have to get this dumb period well im gonna be mature and use the proper word " menstral cycle " thing which is soooooooo stupid cause it just gets a whole bunch a young girls pregnant cause they think their grown, then they have to push a freakin body out of this tiny hole, i mean see this is all adam and eve's fault, if she wouldnt have been dumb to eat that freakin fruit, we girls, women w/e would never have any pain but nooooooooooo she jus had to do it, and dumb adam went along with it, anyway lol, being a girl sux so much, we get like no respect, sum boys just think of us is to cook for them and to clean and to freakin have their kids, which sum dont even take care of, sum dont think that were weak and that we cant certain stuff as them, but if u look at it, we have the babies and thats alot of pain doing that, i bet they couldnt do that now could they. We had to fight for all of our rights, and today we dont even get respect, then we get pregnant at liek 16, were considered a hoe, but nooo they dont pay attention to the boy who went    right along with her to get her pregnant now do they, nope. Even though, we dont get treated right sumtimes, and we have to go through alot of sh**, we still have sum ups, we can get out of alot stuff, we can talk our way into getting anything we want from men, and sum people go easy on us, (even though that still sux), but if u look at it, it is kinda nice knowing that u are bringing another life into the world, i guess? U kno wut it is kool being a girl, ( well kinda, depends on how the way u look at it) we are much smarter than boys i dont care wut nobody says and stronger, cause if they were so smart then they would take care of their freakin kids, and think twice b4 they get sum 1 pregnat, ugh now that i think about it, sum boys are such dogs,  i mean all they want it sex, not all sum, so i happy im not like that. Im sure im not the only girl that has felt like being a gurl sux .
