Last night I watched  urlLink Bad Santa , wow, that was hilarious, that kid Thurman is just so funny. So is  urlLink Lauren Graham , I don't think I can ever watch Gilmore Girls again, without thinking, "Fuck Me Santa"(that is what she says in the movie) I did get my first reading assingment from Carroll College. I have to read a book called " Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep" by Philip K. Dick. And I have to go to class a day early to talk about it. I plan on making a trip to the bookstore next week. I hope that used books are still available. Still looking for a joby job!
