I was expecting it to be the usual junk, about a hurricane or some natural disaster or something that is completely unimportant to me, but something I should read just to humor him.  On this piece of paper is a picture of a girl.  "Do you know her, she goes to your school," my dad tells me.  "No, she must be a freshman," I say.  "She died in a carwreck."  On this piece of paper is the sad account of this girl and her boyfriend who were driving home on Monday night.   He was speeding, and the car drifted into the Southbound lane as they went around the curve.  He over corrected and they spun off the side of the road.  The car struck a driveway, became airborne bounced and landed twice more and finally struck a utility pole while upside down and still in the air.  His girlfriend was dead when the cops arrived.  He, however had no life-threatening injuries and is in stable condition. BASTARD!  Uggh.  Why is it necessary to drink, and drive your girlfriend home?!?  This has been drilled in our heads since we have been in school!  I am not saying that he's a bastard for drinking underage, but for being completely irresponsible with someone's life in his hands.  Charges, such as vehicular homicide and underaged drinking are being placed against him.  He deserves everything that's coming to him.  This is one of the many carwrecks that have occured involving people at my schol, and it sickens me to think that nobody has learned thier lesson yet.
