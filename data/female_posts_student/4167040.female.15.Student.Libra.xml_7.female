I don't know why he never called: maybe the phones weren't opened up yet, or maybe he got in trouble for calling me the other day (and wow, would that suck). I just woke up this morning, missing him more than EVER. Like, I realize that I actually NEED him. These days are going by sooo slowly, but at the same time I want them to go by slow because there's barley any summer left and this last summer is a summer I'll never forget.     These past 7 months--I'll never forget. So many things have happened. So many tears spilled, so many sounds of laughter, and the feeling of love. Everything in these past 7 months is more than I thought I would ever experience in a life time. I guess I'm lucky I got to experience all of these things...even if they weren't all happy times. In fact most of them weren't happy, but hey, I guess I'm a stronger person today because of it all, and I'm closer than ever to my best friend and my boyfriend. I don't know why I just said all that, but I guess I got it all out.       I'm actually in a very good mood right now, happy you could call it, lol. Yesterday was just "an off and on" mood, but today I'm happy, yay!       Well, I guess I'm not really doing anything today, I might be working out, but it depends how my muscle is feeling. Other than that, I'm just waiting until Jeff gets home from court. So until next time...um...goodbye? (Tee Hee) Wow...I'm such a loser!
