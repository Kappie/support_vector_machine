I thought I'd be getting the results on my Civics PT! When it was 3rd period, I felt so nervous! *shivers* and I panicked and panicked and panicked.. It turns out that my teacher was absent or late T.T She let us do this seatwork then.. Damn. I wanna see my grade so I can stop worrying already! To continue on to my day at school.. It was okay. I had fun! Meg and I were passing notes during some classes. We had this activity in reading that could increase our PT grades.. It was hard, but I managed. Didn't answer 2 quessies though. Dammit. T.T During lunch period, me and my friends started talking about icky and gross stuff! We were all green-minded and horny, but it was still so much fun! I laughed a lot. Ha-ha. We even made the Hockey Pockey song very green-minded. Haha! That was soooo much fun! XDDD Then, our fun ended since classes resumed.. ~~~~ Last period. Music. A whole new group since it's a new quarter. They picked me as a leader of my group. I know I don't lead well, but I'll do my best for my group! ^___^ Lol! Then, dismissal.. I picked my cousin up in Xavier.. Boy, was he sooo mean! He kept on whacking me and the driver with the fan! He told me to shut up and I'm stupid! *ouch!* He's only grade 5! He's been bullying me since we go home together.. Dammit. I fear him. EVIL has come. Someone save him. I'm only safe when my achi and his achi are there. They stop him. He almost made me cry a while ago. Whacking me on the face! Torturing me. I don't want to ride with him when going hom from school anymore. It's just..PAINFUL. Finally, I got home..SANCTUARY! SANCTUARY! There was nothing to do since I finished my homework in the car. My bro told me both of us couldn't use the computer 'cause of what happened last night. Darn. Hayy.. But I'm using it now. I'm sneaking. Har har XDDDD I need to do 2 pads of my Kumon! Darn it again. T.T I'm suppose to submit articles to our class mag. Haven't done it yet. Darn it again. T.T Haha. I need serenity! Woohoo! Wait! When I went to my parents' room a while ago, the Tv showed Chad Michael Murray's face! I was like! Woo! Woo! Woo! That nasty girl he's with was doing some nasty stuff with him in the merry-go-round horsey thing.. She kissed his muscles! Goddammit! She's so unfair! URghhhh!! Well, g2g run! I have stuff to do pa.. Argghh.. Later!~~
