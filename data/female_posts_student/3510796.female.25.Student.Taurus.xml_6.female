Then she proceeded to 'make a trail' from the kitchen to the family room with a roll of paper towels.  After all that, she wanted chips and cheese.  So she got the shredded cheese out and was shaking that all over the kitchen.  As I said, all before noon today.  Mo hasn't done anything too exciting, but he did unscrew the handle off the DVD cabinet.   urlLink So and Mo   I was going to wait to post again, but I have class tonight and then I'm going out.  Probably won't be doing much but sleeping when I get home.
