It's like the Atom Bomb of fashion, use it once... maybe not at all if possible, knowing you have it makes you feel like a villian. It's that ugly...  try downloading Wilco, "I'm the man who loves you". It's the only song of their's I found that has serious vibe... oh and go here:  http://www.standard-candle.com/jpurvis/    this is the guy that showed me how much a photo can say. I asked for some kind've a camera for my birthday, I want to start a project. It would basically be me driving around finding weird looking places, with weird lighting, and weird feeling and capturing them... INside the camera...  music is coming a little easier this week, I noticed the stuff I was making up was really really fast and energetic... which means I'm in a GOOOODDD M00D. I think it's gunna last for awhile, I gots a feeling. Also getting itchy for lyrical writing. I'm gunna try that... I turn 18 on sunday. I might have a party next month sometime, I didn't want to plan a party that would conflict with Tia's, but Tia keeps switching the weekend of her's, so I just decided to wait. What does turning 18 mean? I can vote... I no longer am protected by minor laws... I can SIGN for MYSELF... I can be drafted... umm. Is that it?
