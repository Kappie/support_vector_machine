I hate myself when I"m like that, it's not what I wanna be,ya know? so how you all been??? yeah? all right. So I went over to tower records (online) to pre-order....... "A Big Package For You" you all know.... Simple Plan's new DVD out November 25. And you know the whole first 200 people to pre-order gets a signed postcard thingy so of course I was like "I gotta have that!" and I will I was one of the first 200 so yeah! Kick ass!! I can't wait for it! My birthday is on Wed. the 19th....yeah it's gonna suck. Well I better go talk to you all later.
