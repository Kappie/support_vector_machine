Regarding the comment made by Paul...cinnamon milk sucks...I like the pictures in People the best and Brit took third. Anyway...moving on...I was happy today. Just because. Its always first period and my stalker that seem to make me happy. I do really like him. He was just being funny. Then the alarm went off durring 2nd period and no one told us why. we got about half way outside and they started calling us back in. And I'm so confused in my math class right now. For some reason radicals confuse me so much. Yeah...lunch was good...I was somehow wraped up in the most interesting/disturbing conversation I have even been in. Then we are reading this great book in English which I really like. Uhhh...band wasn't bad. I always like band. Uhh..science sucked..but it always does...I hate that class so much. Then in history we are watching Swing Kids which is a great movie. This will actually be the third time I've seen it. And it means that I don't have to work so...It's all good. The stuff for my all state audition is going well! Makes me happy. And now I get t go eat the watermellon that my mom got me. Good day. Very good day.
