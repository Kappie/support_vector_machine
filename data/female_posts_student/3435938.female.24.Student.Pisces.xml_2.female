It turns out, that the interview, taken by Ken Brown from the  Alexis de Tocqueville Institution  is a brief introduction into the history of Unix. Nevertheless, as Andrew stated out, this guy seems like a spy from the SCO group who sharply focuses on points and thesis that are of interest for the SCO lawsuit only. If you're interested in some facts on Unix and the personalities involved in the early days this a great source to get started.  Please let me know, what you think about this sometimes amusing interview. BTW: don't forget to read the followup statement on Ken Brown's motivation clearing up some misconceptions.  Bye,  Jane.
