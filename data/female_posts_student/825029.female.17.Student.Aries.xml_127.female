Today was a great day- did really well on my polyatomic ion quiz in chemistry (after HOURS AND HOURS of memorizing those darn things... sheesh) and just had an overall laid-back day.  And tomorrow is Friday, which makes today even better!  It’s also Valentine’s Day... sure, I think Valentine’s Day is the biggest excuse for a holiday ever and is a huge Hallmark ploy, but I get to hand out super cool valentines that I know will be a smashing success!  Got more mail from colleges today.  In the past couple days, I’ve gotten mail from: Macalester College (wth?) Elon University (wth?) Whitman College (wth?) University of Chicago (at least I’ve heard of this one!) University of Miami (heard of this one, too) Grinnell College (wth?) Coe College (wth?) Boston University (finally, another one I’ve heard of!) Baylor University (yay, another one I’ve heard of!) I can say right now that I won’t be attending any of the above colleges.  What a waste of postage for them!  hehe  Who’s up for seeing Jungle Book 2 this weekend?  Nobody seems very excited about it, but it comes out tomorrow and it looks so great.  Like amazingly great.  I can’t wait to see it!  (And I will see it.)  Cool song alert!  Maroon5 – “Harder to Breathe” and “Shiver” ... I’m totally getting into Maroon5!  All for now... see you guys later!
