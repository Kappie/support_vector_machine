At the beginning we were supposed to give our name, favorite animal, favorite color, our race, one stereotype about our race and then debunk said stereotype. There were over 100 people in the room so it took ages to get through all the introductions. Lucia, Breanna, Maija and I were all near the back of the room so we were last and needless to say, very bored. Lucia's intro made me laugh though: "Hi! My name is Lucia. I'm orange and my favorite color is Latina!" She did it for a laugh but the instructor seemed to think she was serious which made it even funnier.  Anyway, I was supposed to disprove the "White People can't dance." stereotype. I'm not actually the best person for that as I can't dance. So I just said "Loads of white people can dance." To which some random guy sitting near me replied "Yeah! We can river dance!" Things like that make me so very proud of my whiteness. Yeah right.  Goodbye, I'm off to make a rocket out of a soda bottle. (Really, it's some crap science thing.)
