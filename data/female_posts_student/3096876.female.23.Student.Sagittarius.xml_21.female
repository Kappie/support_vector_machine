All I need to do is just get through this one hour of class, then it's one more thing I can cross off the list.  I'm exhausted.  This time change has killed me.  At least it's beautiful and sunny.  Cold though.  So cold I had to put my three-in-one back together today.  Sheesh.  Two weeks ago I took the liner out, last week I switched to a spring jacket.  And now, I'm back to full winter coat.  Although, at least I have enough pockets to carry everything--train ticket and pass, subway tokens, cell, mp3 player, shades.  Spring jackets just aren't bulky enough to lend themselves to utilitarianism.  Ugh.  I just have to get through this class, then refine my article critique, start and finish my anthro paper, then write another exam on Wednesday and  FINI !  I met one of Ky's profs today - Steven Scharper.  Where the heck was this guy for the last four years I've been at UofT?  I wish I had taken a course of his.  At least he recommended a good book:  urlLink Red Blood, by Robert Hunter .  I can't wait to read it.  I have so many books to read this summer.  Books I would have loved to read while I was still in school, but there's not much to be done about that now.  Ky thinks Effective Writing will be too easy for me, but I need a first semester half-course to balance out the second semester half-course I want to take: Achieving goals through words.  It's a semiotics course.  Looks really good.  I've got to remember to take a look at those post-grad courses at Humber that caught my eye...
