My closet has been used as a dumping-zone for the past few years, so now i got rid of everything that's too small for me, or that's hideous. I found this really cute black skirt that I look TOTALLY hot in, but also this dress that looks like a lampshade. It's dark blue with little white flowers and has a matching sash and bonnet. I disposed of them all immediately. Then I found all these notes I wrote in like fourth grade. They were amusing. Another great day in the life of April. La'ers, April
