Although I felt incredibly horrified and saddened that a human being, no less God, was subjected to such cruelty, (so much was just literally difficult to watch), I felt other things too.   I kept thinking how that was God there and how no one could really kill him. They were doing those things to him, but I don't think of him as a  victim. Even in his weakened, blood drenched states, I kept thinking that no one could kill him.    And it made me think how I really don't understand it all as much as I had thought. It's not discouraging. In fact, it's wonderful. There's a lot more to it that I just haven't figured out. I mean, why all that pain and the short life? Why come to earth as a human at all? Why did God decide to do it that way. It's this whole system that's unfolding and that I don't understand. I don't really plan to understand it this week or next year. But maybe someday I will have a better glimpse.    Well, I have to remind myself that this movie isn't the Bible, but it does give me some things to think about. But now I'm very very sleepy, so I will take out my contacts and get to bed. Enough posting for one day. =)  Thank you for making dinner tonight, Stacey!
