When I replied with a quiet "yes," they didn't respond or anything they just walked away. I didn't receive a thanks or anything. This is after I discovered how to find out how thick a piece of foil is by doing research, typing up and editing all the bull shit they screwed up on, and so forth. Maybe I am being a little hasty, but my time is very valuable to me. Last night I didn't have time to finish all my homework because I was editing "OUR" paper. I though a group paper, was suppose to be a group "effort." Next time I'm doing the work on my own. Christ, I might as well. -Nikki
