But for them, I know exactly what you're going through with him.  I feel the same way for someone too.  But his name shall never be disclosed.  It's a wonderful feeling though, when I see him in the hallway.  He even smiles at me and a few times caught up and talked with me.  The problem is I sometimes feel like he treats me like a sister.  And thats okay sometimes, but when you just want more it starts to kill you inside.  I struggle with myself though because I don't want to say that I'm in love with him.  What do I know about love?  But I really think I'm almost there.  We talk all the time and all though we may not be close now I must say I think that day will come.  And other times I think what the fuck am I doing wrong, but I suppose for now I will just live everyday as it comes.
