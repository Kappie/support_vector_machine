YAY!  got home at 12am, fell asleep.  woke up, went to church. came back, finished my desk [by myself, b/c dad was being a baby and said if it was just one part i needed to do it myself, so i did] um... but the internet connection wouldnt reach to my computer anymore [that damned hole in my wall, that dad was supposed to fix since last summer] so now i set up my computer but the things a mess.  and my brother is going crazy because therez a virus in his new computer and when he gets mad... hes like a calm version of steven. so he screams and gets histerical, but not like ready to kill. [he has A.D.D.  and hes always been a little weird, but hes ok] but unlike steven, his anger lasts. in fact, i can hear him pounding around rite now, throwing drawers closed and pounding the mouse on my parents computer b/c he's trying to get something off there.  um... i still have 140 pages to read of  a very long engagement  by tomorrow. so i gotta ignore everybody and just read. and it doesnt help that its really hard to follow...   beyond books monday. quiz bowl tuesday.  history essay on thursday.  i know im forgetting something...   um... ya, thats my dead weekend.   •patty•
