I made a 4 in Psychology and a 3 in Language/Composition, whew!!! I'm sooo proud of myself. :) Today was also the last day that I work this entire week which is very very good. I applied other jobs, but no luck yet. I've just got to get away from  Subway !!! NO more Cold Cut Combo, extra mayo! Today a lady told me that the Tea I fixed her was sour, sour tea?? Come on now. Oh side note: I did not mean to affend Jess by the previous  taxi  statement, lol. My grandmother is going to Duke for some tests on Monday so i have been keeping her records everyday--I feel so bad for her, even though she did call me fat when i was little (sigh). Jess and Nikol have their bet going on--I call Travis, hehe. Oh I also cleaned the  Caddy  today especially for my friends to pimp tomorrow.I had to super glue my rear-view *mirrow* back on because it fell off and was swingin around whileI was driving.. uggh..I'm sooo ghetto. Sorry I'm kind of jumping from subject to subject, oh well. My favorite song of the day is: drumroll, please.... Dare you to run atleast I think that is what it is called. You can tell I really love it. No word from Chad-- He's too busy for a girlfriend, of course! OH WeLL
