Out of a possible two-hundred negatives I could have picked to describe myself at the shrink yesterday, I got 178. That in itself told me a lot about where I'm coming from, and the fact that I can't see through anyone's eyes except my own, and it hurts to do it. I really try to control these thoughts and think things differently, but every time I try I just get myself more down. I know this isn't a Leigh Anne situation, and I'm trying so hard not to put it in that light, but sometimes...it's hard to fight the past, especially when it's so close.  It's only been a year since I broke that off, almost literally. It was sometime in early April. One of the biggest things troubling me is the fact that some things that are troubling me, are. They shouldn't be anymore. But I have a lot of shit to work out in myself.  But really....thank you for this. And I'll try to keep my face...sometimes I just don't know how. "You're either manic and high or depressed and down," says Bright Eyes. Sometimes I feel like that, thinking that scares me into submission, too. But I really appreciate your being here. I just really hope I can make it out to the other end in one piece. What you said was perfect, I just need to take it to heart and try to apply it. God...we'll see.  And you know, I'll always come to these things, and I'll always be here, because you're there for me. Life hasn't been all so bad as I say when I think about it and all the people that have made it a million times more colorful than it should ever have been, and you've contributed so much to that. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
