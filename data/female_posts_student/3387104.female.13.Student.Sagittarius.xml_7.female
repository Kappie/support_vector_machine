Before that I had not written a _single_ word and in the front veranda all my pages blew away. We write on loose pages. Hella thinks it's better because then one does not have to tear anything out. But we have promised one another to throw nothing away and not to tear anything up. Why should we? One can tell a friend everything. A pretty friend if one couldn't. Yesterday when I wanted to go into the arbour Dora glared at me savagely, saying What do you want? As if the arbour belonged to her, just as she wanted to bag he front veranda all for herself. She's too sickening.  Yesterday afternoon we were on the Kolber-Kogel. It was lovely. Father was awfully jolly and we pelted one another with pine-cones. It was jolly. I threw one at Dora and it hit her on her padded bust. She let out such a yell and I said out loud You couldn't feel it _there_. As she went by she said Pig! It doesn't matter, for I know she understood me and that what I said was true. I should like to know what _she_ writes about every day to Erika and what she writes in her diary. Mother was out of sorts and stayed at home.
