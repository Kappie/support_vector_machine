I don't actually care that gained weight cause I look good and feel happy except for when my Mom and I argue.  Last night I just kept thing about one thing.  University.  My mom told me that she new a lady whose son had a 90% average and didn't get it.  I am so scared.  People always tell me I should have a back up plan just in case - but I don't.  I only want to do ONE thing with my life, and that is teach.  I can't imagine doing anything else, which is why I WILL become a teacher.  I mean it's like their in a inner voice telling me this is my purpose in life and the role I am to fulfil.  I am so scared about getting into University.  I don't think I could handle rejection.  I don't know what I would do, and I don't have a back-up plan.
