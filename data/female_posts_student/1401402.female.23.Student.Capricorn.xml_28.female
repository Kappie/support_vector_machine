What is passion? Does everyone have passion? Is everyone supposed to have passion? Do I, myself have passion? I do not know what my passions are and I do not want to know. Allow me to define "PASSION".   Passion= Fulfilling, strong liking, desire, devotion, concept, sexual desire, goals, feels good about yourself, happiness, peace and GIVE.   Damn, I am not even sure if I have passion. I just know that I love to give; I cannot say no from time to time, that is my biggest problem. Offering because I would feel ashamed if I didnt. I trust myself and i give people a chance to open up to me.   Follow your dreams or fulfilled your passion, be honest with yourself and bottom point of all truly love yourself. Passion is a total concept of loving yourself before you can even love someone in particular. Don't ever put yourself down for some silly reasons. Just be happy with what you have and dont hate on people because of their backround, looks, etc.   So what are you passionate about? If you do not have an answer for yourself you're not ready for many things. Either you win or you lose. You choose. Your choice. Ask yourself.
