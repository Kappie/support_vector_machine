Not satisfied with killing prople of the third world, the company decided to start on England by bringing out Dasani TM 'A little bottle of time' (ie ticking time bomb that's gonna kill you)  urlLink http://uk.news.yahoo.com/040319/325/eozdd.html  Actually... it wasn't that dangerous. You'd probably have to drink about a bath's worth to actually get cancer from it though. But still! Coke are evil! *don't make me give you the coke talk again* Yup, there's a lot of boycotting out there to do and I intend to stick to it! *hell, there'll probably a boycott to boycott my boycott but that would just be confusing.* Umm... my pc's cracking so I'll have to post later.
