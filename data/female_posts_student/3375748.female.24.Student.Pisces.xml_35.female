I don't know why, but while I was relaxing, I thought about my mom. There was one old time image came out of my mind which is I was eating something and my mom came out and told me don't eat snakes because we will have dinner soon. I felt so upset and depressed. I start to miss my parents. I am not that kind of girl who easy miss their parents, but I felt that the times that I miss my family is more than before. While I do nails for those ladies whose age are close to my mom or grandmother, I will miss them. While I think about all those Korean co-works who are nice to me and have children close to my age, I will miss my parents. I do miss them, I think. Haven't leave with them or spend any quality time with them in 6 years. I should shame on myself for whatever I did to make my parents sad or disappointed. After all, I am their only child and they love me deeply and truly. I love them too, but it just hard for me to tell them. I hope I can see them soon, and best wishes for them. ( The picture: I was only 15. I looked so stupid, but look at my family, we were all happy. I haven't see any of us have that kind of smile together for long time. I miss my happy family.)  今天工作很忙，很多客人。我都没有什么时间可以休息。不过，还好的是有那么一点点。在那一点点的时间里，我就去厨房吃点饼干。一个人坐在厨房的椅子上，吃着饼干，不知道为什么忽然想起了在国内的一幕：我在吃着零食，妈妈从房间里走出来说：“马上就要吃饭了，你还吃零食。”忽然一下，我觉得很伤感，心里有种说不出来的滋味，是不是寂寞，我也不知道。开车回家的时候也一样，开着开着，忽然想家；给年龄偏向中老年的客人美甲时会想起妈妈和奶奶；看见那些对我很好，孩子和我差不多大的韩国阿姨时，也会想家。有时觉得我那些家在美国的朋友真好，回到家里，爸爸妈妈兄弟姐妹都在。不像我们，孤独的一个人。我不是一个很容易想家的人，可是这一年来想家的次数比原来多了。不知道是不是因为我老了，我自己有时候真为自己感到羞耻，辜负了父母那么多的爱和好心。毕竟我是他们唯一的孩子，他们对我的爱是毫无保留并没有目的的。希望我不会再辜负他们，也希望能够早点见到他们。祝他们身体健康，快乐，平安。（照片：我大概15岁吧！看起来像个男孩子，傻傻的~，不过我很喜欢这张照片，因为我们一家人在照片中的那中笑容，我已经很久没有看见过了。快乐美满的家庭是我所向往的，我爱我家哦！） urlLink     urlLink
