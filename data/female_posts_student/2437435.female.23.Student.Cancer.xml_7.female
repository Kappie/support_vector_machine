Secondly, people to keep my time occupied. And thirdly, and most importantly, I always forget how to get it to let me write stuff on here. That being said, its good to note that I have continued in my pursuit of writing bad literature and as my older brother and Michelle eloquently stated, they are starting my fan club.  As my head finally starts to shrink, I will go on about the things in my life which are of note.  The APA (American Philosophical Association) conference was amazing to say the least. I dragged Michelle to this enchanting event and as always, she made it a laugh fest.. Hey Michelle, I am going to document the Huntington Library experience and Chantry Flats (ironic title) so future generations can laugh at us too! The highlight of it was the next day Friday, where I took off school and met up with my favourite professor and to say I was enthralled is not a strong enough word. Granted most people there looked like they were out of a time and social warp, but it comes with the nerdy territory I crave and I'm sure my friends and family won't let me become like that. I spoke to some professors at Stanford, and now... that is going to be my aim for graduate and law school.  It is wonderful when you love something more than yourself and to get a concentrated channel of it and see a window into your soul as clear as air. It's true that if it wasn't for philosophy, the pursuit of knowledge, wisdom and ethics, I wouldn't be who I am, but don't think I am after this for a piece of paper to hang on my study wall. Its what all this can help me do for humanity. I want to make up for all the times I looked away when I should have lent a hand. For everytime I had more to give and didn't. For the lives I could have touched but didn't. Its a very selfish dream but its a means to an incredible end.   If I can stop one heart from breaking, I shall not live in vain, If I can ease one life the aching, Or cool one pain,  Or help one fainting robin Unto his nest again, I shall not live in vain ~Emily Dickinson
