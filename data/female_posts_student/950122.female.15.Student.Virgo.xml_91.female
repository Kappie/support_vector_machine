The first thing that popped into my mind was,  "Why do these people want to watch it in a movie theater?? They're obviously going to be fazed out afterwards, plus they'll be crying through out the movie."  Yes, this is the perfect time to show it because it's Holy Week. In fact, we already have a pirated DVD of it. But I ask myself; am I ready to watch it? A comment that I've heard about it is,  "Agony in the Garden pa lang, magi-guilty ka na."   LT: "You'll only reach the Agony in the Garden, and you'll already feel guilty."  Agony in the Garden is in the beginning of the movie. So I've been thinking. Am I ready to wake myself up from the illusion that is life? Afterall, I believe that Jesus died to save us. Am I ready to realize first hand how much in debt I am to Him? Seeing it first hand is different from reading it. To actually see a person, even more so Jesus, being tortured and beaten to high hell is agonizing. But what more to know that the person did it all for you. I have mixed feelings because yes, I do love Him, but I also rely on myself a lot, often forgeting about God.  It's like slapping yourself and saying, "You're only human." Which we all are.
