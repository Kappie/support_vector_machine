He was on the couch and I was ironing when the phone rang. I went over to my desk to check the Caller ID and it said that it was Debby calling. I told Todd that it was her and he asked me to answer the phone. By this time I had gone back over to the ironing board and I snapped at him " You  answer the phone, she's  your  mom." That was a really bad idea. The phone stopped ringing when the answering machine picked up and Todd got mad at me because he had something in his mouth and I didn't know about it. That's the only reason I told him to answer the phone; because I thought he was just laying there. I had no idea something was in his mouth at the time. I thought he'd swallowed it. Anyway, so he is pissed at me because I was rude and he'd just gotten up. I said that I was sorry (a couple times) for being rude and that I was sorry for pissing him off. Damnit I hate it when I do that. I didn't think about what he was doing, I just opened my mouth and snapped at him. Sometimes I am such an idiot.  What I plan on doing is leaving him alone for the day so he can brood about me pissing him off and hopefully get over it, then when I go home after Math Methods I'm going to stop by Subway and pick up some dinner so he doesn't have to eat another Lean Pocket.  Karen called me last night and said that their gathering was moved from Tuesday night to Thursday night. I'll get out of class at 7pm so I would be able to make it, but I probably won't go because I'm tuckered out from school on Thursday nights and I will want to get a head start on my homework for the next week. Plus work on that damn activities notebook.  I don't have anything to do right now, so I'm going to act like I'm working. I'm hoping the time will pass quickly. It usually does; time passes almost too fast now.
