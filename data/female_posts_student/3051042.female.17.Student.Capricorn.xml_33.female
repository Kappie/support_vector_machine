I think. He wants me to be happy but that's really not what I'm interested in. I'm not the one that needs happiness. That or give me a bottle of alcohol and I'll be fine for the moment.  In other news, I think Paul has accepted the fact that I'm not going to have sex with him. That's a good thing. He's still not off my crotch. Jeff, Zinc, Henk, Nick and I went to a tool store today (I forget the name) but I was going to buy a hammer taker to keep Paul's dick in his pants. You think it'd work?  Michelle's phone got disconnected. Keith and I have plans for Friday afternoon coffee. I'm anticipating his call back this evening.   All this shit running through my head just pisses me off. Chain smoker and all... not attractive. But who the hell should I be attractive for? What the hell is attractive? I've lost my path in life... sometimes you just need to cut across the field.   Maybe Mike is right. I need to stop wearing my heart out on my sleeve. Zero 7 and the Virgin Suicides sound track, please put me to sleep. I need something...
