Romantic dinner for a serious boyfriend, but an amusement park for first- or second-time dates.     4-A long walk or the movies?  Both!     5-The phone or in person?  In person, always. Hate phones.     6-Handwritten letters or e-mails?  Either ^^;     7-First Date Kiss?  NO! Someone who is that forward is just... ick!     8-Outdoors guy or sporty?  Outdoors, totally. I like musicians, but quietness is always iffy and tree-huggers rock my world.     9-Piercings on guys?  sure!     10-Hat or no hat?  Depends     11-Glasses or not?  No glasses     12-Is religion important?  Definitely. I want someone who knows what he believes, accepts and welcomes others' ideas, is willing to talk about religion / other controversial things with me, is very spiritual and cares.     13-Serious or funny?  Ooh.. funny, but understanding. Understanding is essential.     14-Do smarts matter?  Umm... yes. Stupid people bug me. Deep thought and conversation is a must. But not always serious. Someone who can appreciate The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy! Grades aren't important, but Cleverness is, and wit, too. It's also better if he's not a teacher's pet.     15-A guy to hold you or a guy to laugh with?   Laugh with     16-Tan or light?  Hmm... depends.     17-Spontaneous or predictable?   Spontaneous ideas, predictable personality.     18-Describe the perfect date:  Out for an evening walk in the springtime, wandering the streets together, eventually going to a cafe for a quick snacky-dinner. Feeding ducks in a pond!     20-Describe the perfect guy:  Tall, and if not muscular, not skinny, either. I like thickness and coziness and bigness, so that when he hugs me it feels like I'm all wrapped up. Dark, long-ish curly/shaggy hair, quick eyes and sharp nose, easy-to-laugh mouth with pointy teeth ^^; (don't ask *g*) Funny and reasonably obnoxious in groups and with friends, but when it comes to romance, a bit shy and awkward. Still brave enough to make a move though! Loyalty is key. So is independence -- he's all for my 'depending on substances is evil' opinion. Musical, poetic, intelligent but not brainy. Likes games and medieval-y things like me ^^; Has a good sense of humour, slightly irresponsible, in love with nature just like me, realizes I'd give my life for my dog rather than him, and willing to sacrifice everything for something he believes in. Passionate and understanding, edgy and friendly. I'm sure he's out there somewhere. Probably not human, though.
