I'm just going in now to say hi to all of my fans. If they exist. If not then I too (Beth does) have a mild case of schizophrenia. At the moment I should be editing, but I'm not due to the fact that I have lot's of homework. If I don't get all of it done by at least the middle of this week Bethie is going to slotter me. That would deffinatly suck.
