Just treat the corrections as a lowly reference, okay? After all, I'm not anyone with any authority...        There are  thousands    of people buying pirated  CDs from street hawkers and downloading illegal MP3s from the internet  every day .  However -=don't start a sentence with the word "but"=- , these people are seldom charged guiltyfor  participating in these illegal trades . As  a result  -=we always say "as a result"=- , the  original producers  are losing millions of dollars in revenue!        The main reason why so many people  would rather  buy illegal CDs is that these CDs are much cheaper than  the  legal ones. Downloading MP3s is also popular because it is free! People exchange songs and they can choose  whatever  songs they like. This  saves so much money -=it's not only cheaper! it's free!=-and is much more convenient than buying the whole CD.      I think this illegal trade is very selfish  -=only selfish??? What about short-sighted? or degrading? it's better to use two adjectives, and if you do that, remove "very"=- . A lot of  effort -=EFFORT!!! UNCOUNTABLE!!!=- and money are needed to  produce an album -=you don't complete a CD=- .  However, -=same as above=- some people take  -=no "the" here. there are none in the question even.=- advantage of a bargain with the street hawkers and buy these illegal CDs out of greed. There is no difference between stealing and buying  pirated -=the word illegal is overused=- CDs because we obtain something which we  do -=keep the tenses consistent!=- not pay for  - not to the deserving party at least -=what do you mean, we don't pay for the CDs? Even $10 is money. We just don't pay it to the producers=- . We  lose -=verb: lose. noun: loss=- our dignity when we steal! Despite the seriousness of this crime, the problem of selling and buying illegal CDs  keeps -=tenses!=- worsening.  -=You haven't quite given the main point here. "this crime" refers to what? people can't draw the conclusion.=-        To be continued. Too hungry to go on. Going to look for something to eat.
