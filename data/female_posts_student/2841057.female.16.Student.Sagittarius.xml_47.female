The Girl I Was With You  Listen, just hear me out Yes, I know we agreed When we break up, we'd never give in to this need To admit to each other, I miss you  Listen, just hear my cry No, I won't break my word If I do say, "I miss you," it will never be heard Let my heart whisper all that it needs to  How can you make and take a start And just leave me here hanging Can't even say what I'm feeling How could you make then break my heart If I can't say, "I miss you" Let me say one last thing  I miss her and all the things she could do I miss her just as much as I miss you I miss her, I know you're wondering who I miss her, I miss the man I was with you  I will never be the same  Listen just hear my voice, can you hear all the tears That I'm planning to hide for the next thousand years Just as long as you know, I love you  How can a blind girl see the light How can I find our kind of right How can you take away my sight How could you lose me in the night Then you come and take my heart away Now I'm losing this fight No, I will never be the same  I miss the girl I was with you...
