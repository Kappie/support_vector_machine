Ana said, "Oh yeah..the way you cut off some of your words...and the melody of your Spanish. It's very cubano." On the other hand, when I came back from southern Spain, I had apparently picked up their accent as well--but I had recognized that, since you couldn't really miss the fact that I pronounced nearly every "s" with a "th" sound that even became annoying to me after awhile. "Gra(th)ia(th)" instead of "Gracias". Not that I could help it. So I had that Andalucian, southern Spain accent until I went to Cuba, when I finally dropped it. I was not consciously aware, however, that I had picked up the Cuban habit of dropping most of my "s" 's altogether until today. So now apparently it's "Mucha gracia..." I guess picking up the Cuban version of Spanish was more subconsious than anything else, since I spent so much time there.  It's funny how one will pick up dialects. I am consciously aware of my Carioca (Rio de Janeiro) Portuguese, because again it is impossible not to notice that I'm pronouncing an "s" as an "sh". "Fes(h)tas", "es(h)ta fazendo", ect. I think that's because the first native Brazilian that taught me Portuguese was from Rio, and I had her for over a year, hence my picking up her way of speaking. I guess there's something with me and the pronouncing of "s" in various romantic languages that changes frequently--who knows. I wonder if I'll drop the Rio dialect and pick up the SÃ£o Paulo version if I get the Fulbright and move there. Probably--though it would probably take a while.  I have so much to do over Thanksgiving--it's not going to be much of a vacation at all. I have to: -Study for the GRE -Write my personal statement for Grad Schools -Write a 10-page paper for Spanish prose -Read the U.S.-Latin American relations book for Dietz's class -Finish my thesis -Clean the house, and help put up decorations for Christmas  I don't think I'm leaving anything out...besides the fact that I graduate about a week after Thanksgiving.  ;-)
