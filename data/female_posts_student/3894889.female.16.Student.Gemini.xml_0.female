One of the aides, Resentment, proposed, "We should convince them there is no God." Satan sneered at Resentment and replied, "That would never work. They know there's a God."   Bitterness then spoke up: "We'll convince them that God does not really care about right or wrong." Satan thought about the idea for a few moments but then rejected it. "Too many know that God does care," he finally said.   Malice then proposed his idea: "We'll let them go on thinking there is a God and that He cares about right and wrong. But we will keep whispering that there is no hurry, there is no hurry, there is no hurry."   Satan howled with delight! The plan was adopted, and Malice was promoted to an even higher position in Satan's malevolent hierarchy.   If you have never given your heart to God, NOW is the time to reach out to Him. Don't be deceived. Today is the day of decision; tomorrow may be too late.
