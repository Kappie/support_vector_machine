I presently have no complaints because I'm happy I semi-learned to do cool stuffs with my blog text and fonts and stuff!... Okay so I just changed the colors, so what? ^_^\/ they're cool colors. I think, since I have nothing better, I'll create an index of faces!  ^_^\/ - grinning, peace sign ^_^\m/ - grinning, rock on ^_~ - wink n.n - slighly smug o.o; - shocked/stunned/wiered out O.o; - same as above but to a grater extent O.O; - same as above but to a grater extent -_- - ..Just what it looks like... kinda exasperated... ^_^¿ - sweatdrop; slightly embarassed/amused/exasperated... there are many applications... XP - sticking out tongue; more 'mocking' then :-p XD - grinning/laughing @.@ - dizzy/info overload/the look Pokemon get when knocked out  ...If i've forgotten any I'll add them later. ^_^\/The ways we amuse outselves nowadays, ne? Oh! I'll also create a japanese dictionary... or not. I don't know that much Japanese. And I still can't tell the difference in the uses of 'sumimasen'... Oh well! I know how to bow! Yup yup yup...  Hmm... what else can I make a dictionary for? I'm too lazy to go find something proper to do. Typing is easy, isn't it? Simple, fast, easy, and only hurts your wrist if you go at it the entire day, as opposed to the 15 minutes it takes to hurt your hand writing longhand. Or maybe that's just me.  And for the record, I do not babble. And I know you technically aren't supposed to start a sentance with 'and'. But oh well. ...Or 'but'... ... ... oy...  Ah hah! I know what I can make a dictionary for! Or rather, a recipie... Whee!    The Perfect S'more    By Moi    (that is how you spell it, right?)    Equipment:  Either a bonfire, gas or electric stove. Candles usually do not work. Long wooden stick(if using a bonfire), long shish-kabob skewer(do NOT use if Shish-ka Bob is anywhere nearby)   Ingrediants:  1 Marshmallow (Man-Eating Marshmallows acceptable, but not very tasty) 2 Graham cracker halves (approximately 2"X2", but any size that will fit your Marshmallow will work.) 1/3 Hershey's chocolate bar (preferably one high in protien. Make sure it says 'contains at least 3 bug legs' on the wrapper!)   Pro-de-cure:  Step 1: Turn on stove/light bonfire. If you elect the second option, have a pitcher of lemonade for saftey reasons nearby. Guava-Piña juice will work in a pinch, I think, however it has not been confirmed. Step 2: Spear your Marshmallow with your cooking untensil of choice (see notes under 'Equipment') Step 3: Move close enough to your cooking source that the heat is blistering. This is to ensure maximum appreciation of your gooey treat. Watch the outside of your Marshmallow. When it becomes a light, golden brown, or a slightly darker golden brown with a bubbly surface texture, it is ready. Prop the Marshamllow near the heat to keep it warm. Step 4: Place Chocolate on one half of the Graham Cracker. Pick up your cooking utensil of choice and position it so that the Marshmallow is resting on the Chocolate-garnished half of Graham Cracker. Step 5: Place the top half of the Graham Cracker on top; withdraw the cooking utensil of choice. Mush the halves together until Marshmallow threatens to spill over the edges. This is tricky, Marshmallow's voices are often very quiet. Step 6: Here the recipie splits into two sections: -Locate the nearest Russian Beyblader. If they have red or blue hair that seemingly defies gravity, smush the S'more in thier hair... Only do this AFTER you make sure you are wearing track shoes. -Eat the S'more. This option, while not as amusing as the first, is the most satisfactory to the tastebuds.  Congratulations! You have made a S'more!  Alas! I have come up with another section to make in this (already long) post!    The most common misconception in YuGiOh    As Misconcieved by my father     The Misconception: There is a card that increses the lifepoints of a player by 400.  The Truth behind the misconception: Contrary to popular belief, there is NOT a card that icreaces one's life points by 400. Card combonations, however, are possible. The Magic card Enchanted Javelin increases one's Life Points by the ATK points of the attacking monster. In the VERY rare case that someone would attack you with one such monster, you could theoretically use this card to increase your lifepoints by 400. However, only a complete idiot would attack with such a weak monster, and only an ever dumber person would waste a powerful card like Enchanted Javelin on such a weak attack. So there. XP  Hm... I've wasted nearly an hour writing pointless babble! ...Well, if I may borrow a quote from Duo of Gundam Wing, "I do not babble!!! I merely enhance the general knowledge of the people around me with my constant barriage of witty and useless intellegence!" So there. ^_^\/  And yet...  I've still got more to say! I think... I shall now insert my own takes on various cliches...    E's guide to Ridiculous Sayings and Altered Song Lyrics    It is wise to try and kill two birds with one stone, although typically it's the Hobbits who succeed at this. Normal humans can too, however it is usually a complex process that includes painting the rock blue so that it's visible, throwing it at a bird, retrieving it, and then throwing it again.  To go the whole nine yards is a good idea, unless you're a football player. Then, you'll get teased if you only go nine yards. Football players best shoot for the full 100 yeards.  Don't count your chickins before they hatch, because you never know how many will be ducks. Or geese. Or emu. Or penguins... Pesky penguins, always laying their eggs in the basket... Best keep several baskets full of eggs to confuse them.  Bye bye miss American pie, drove my CHEVY to the levy but the levy was broken becuase the flood destroyed it mercilessly, killing hundreds of people in the process during one of the worst disaters in this century... erm... and good old boys were drinking the whisky and rye they found floating among the wreckage, singing 'this'll be the day that I die...', which is coincidentally was, because the dam upstream broke just them and unleashed another flood.  A bird in the hand is better than two overhead... Unless of course the two overhead are in fact dead and hung up to drain so that you can cook them, in which case you'll only get bloody, not pooped on... Which is probably worse, because blood stains. But chickin is yummy. So it's all good.  If you have a frog in your throat, start writing your will. Frogs do not allow for breathability.  The journey of a thousand miles begins with a tiny gold ring, a crazy old wizard, a loyal gardener and cousins, a broken carrot, and being chased halfway there by nine wraiths on black steeds. Unless, of course, you aren't Frodo Baggins. Then it's just a step. And maybe a new tank of gas.  A spoon full of sugar makes the medicine go down, although it negates the effect of the Wolfsbane potion, so if you're Remus Lupin, ignore this.  All that glitters is not gold, sometimes its silver, diamonds, or Mithril. All of which are better than gold... Unless the gold is Aragorn. In which case only the Mithril is better. I think. It's hard to tell.  Comparing apples and oranges is quite easy. All you have to do is measure them for weight, density, water content, chemical makeup and volume. The results of these tests CLEARLY show that nothing rhymes with purple.  A rose by any other name would smell as sweet, unless is was dropped in dung. But who would give thier girlfriend a dung-covered rose anyway? ...*slaps the one guy who rose his hand*... I repete: Who would give thier girlfriend a dung-covered rose anyway? *crickets* n.n Good.    Alas, it has come time that i must part with you, for I have run out of random things to cram into your brains. Thus, i leave you with these final words:  I do not suffer from Insanity. I thouroughly enjoy every moment of it ^_^\/  Peace, love, and Tala's hair!
