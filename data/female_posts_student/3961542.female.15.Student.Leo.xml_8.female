An early start followed by the sight of  'Rizzie' , dripping from head to toe with moistness (and by that i mean fresh out of the shower).     Next thing that happened is that our dear friend and twin of  'Fin' ,didnt know that we     werestill going to Lincoln.But a quick phone call to her mother ( Mrs Wendy)  soon sorted that out, and  'Row'  was soon woken up from her deep deep sleep from beyond.           What seemed like hours later that poor excuse of a train greeted our eyes and we where soon on our merry merry way!      Our VIP seats aboard the train where extremly comfortable and our journey was made that little more brighter with our friendly and really rather groovy ticket meister.... Mr Dave  (we did find out that his real name was actually  Mark ...but we prefered  Dave ).          As soon as we stepped foot on Lincoln soil, we made our way to ye olde Odeon to feast our eyes on 'Shrek 2'.Oh how we laughed (!), and  'Rizzie'  did an excellent impression of someone trying to dance, which im sure made several young children cry.          After hours of rib tickling laughter, we made our way to 'poundland', where we spent the rest of the afternoon prancing around dressed as fairies.          As the day was drawing to a close,  me  and  'Row'  went to water our taste buds with a light and refreshing beverage, and descided to meet the others back at the station.     Soon enough the train had arrived, but there was no sign of the other faries.As the train was ready to leave, my eyes spotted the other fairies and mad ones running as fast as their little legs could take them to try and catch the train.     The likes of  'Hannah','Emily'  and  'Marshall'  managed to jump aboard..but Woe behold, the others didnt make it and had to endure 8 minutes until another carriage came to take them home.           I must say it was an extremly eventfull day, full of quirky suprises and a gimp looking like a bug (or sum random whos name i have forgotten and was wearing a hat over there face).             So for now my chums...     Goodbyb     XxXxXx               Image by  urlLink FlamingText.com
