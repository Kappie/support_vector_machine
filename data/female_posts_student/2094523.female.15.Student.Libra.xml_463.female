I kinda thot it wud be better tho.. it was a .. strange movie there was so much unnecessary and insignificant scenes in it. little more than mediocre id give it. Yep and i also got some M.A.C. lipgloss in pink lemonade. lipgloss makes the girl as i like to say. for real. i am pretty damn cool. shoot me if im cocky , but dont shoot me because im gorgeous. hey dont slap me with the truth, dont break my spirit coz i am pretty damn fine today.
