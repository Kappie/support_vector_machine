So if you have any questions about anything, please ask.   - It is very HOT there. Not humid hot like Indiana, but dry hot. My hair didn’t even curl. It got up to over 100 every day. Every time you stepped outside, it was like a hairdryer was blowing in your face. Even at night it only went down to like 80. HOT HOT HOT.  -We walked the strip just about everyday. No not strip as in take your clothes off. The strip is the long line of hotels/casinos. The whole strip is like 2 miles long and I like walked it every day.  -The casinos are cool too. Each one has a different theme. But if you are under 21 you had to stay on the red carpet and keep moving at all times. Blah blah blah. Here is a list of all the casinos/hotels I went into:  Riviera (I stayed there)  Paris  Aladdin  Circus Circus  Venetian  Mirage  Caesar’s Palace  Bellagio  New York New York  MGM Grand  Flamingo  Excalibur  Treasure Island  - Now some of you might think that hookers just come up to you on the street. NO. The hookers have Latinos working for them. They stand on the street and hand out cards of topless women with little stars on their boobies. The cards are all over the ground and stuck in signs. It’s like gross. - Lesbos, gays, drunks… It’s nasty.  - Moms in mini-skirts = BIG no-no.  - Right outside my hotel window was this little wedding chapel. I watched all these people get married. Aww!  - Since it was Vegas, Mother bought all these drinks and stuff. I got to have a Virgin strawberry colada. It was really good. Mother bought a bottle of rum and she let me sniff it. She also let me try her margarita at Margaritaville. You know, like that song. “Wasted away again at Margaritaville. Looking for my lost shaker of salt. Some people claim that there’s a woman to blame. But I know, it’s nobody’s fault.” No one I was with got overly drunk, don’t worry.  - Two stores that I like a lot were at the very other end of the strip. And we walked there twice. There was the Coke store and the MM factory. They were so cool! I got Coke and MM’s all in one day!  - Circus Circus was really awesome. They had all these midways and a bunch of acts. There were these two really really strong guys who would like balance on each other. And then there were these acrobats. It was cool. - Now as a lot of you might know, some of my friends and I are totally into a couple musicals. Mostly Wicked and RENT. Well, at the competition there was this raffle. One of the days you could win four posters. Two of them were Wicked and RENT. I went all excited. I didn’t win though. Oh well.  - While in Vegas, I went to some shows. One of them was at the Treasure Island. It was this pirate show with girl pirates and boy pirates. First, one boy pirate climbs onto the girl pirate ship. Then the girl pirates like strip dance for him. Then the boy pirates come to save him, but the girl pirates fight them. (with like dancing and singing) Then they blow up the boy ship and it sinks. And the boy pirates come onto the girl pirate ship and dance. Yea… Another show was La Cage. This one is the female impersonators. It was HILARIOUS! The main guy was dressed up as Joan Rivers, and each time he came onstage, he had on a new dress and a new joke. I didn’t get a lot of it, but I think that’s ok. Then all these other guys would come on as famous singers and imitate the girls. Some examples are: Jennifer Lopez, Madonna, fat Madonna, Bette Midler, Judy Garland, Whitney Houstan, Cher, Celine Dion, Britney Spears, Dolly Parton, Michael Jackson, and more who I either forget or can’t spell their name. It was great…  - I was with my friend Gabby the whole time because we shared a room. Now, these adults are dragging us kids into casinos where we can’t do anything. So Gabby and I had this game. We would rub our feet on the carpet and then shock our mothers. Oh, it was great fun! I mean, what do they expect us to do? Be bored?  - On the last day there, we went to downtown Vegas. It’s not like a downtown here. There aren’t any tall buildings or anything. It’s one street filled with a bunch of little gift shops. It was cool, I guess. Really old though.   That’s all about Vegas in general. If you have any questions, please ask.  Now for dance. The whole competition was way messed up. The judges gave all the bad dances first places. They didn’t place teacher’s choices. It was SO messed up like you wouldn’t understand. Half of the dances from my studio didn’t place when I KNOW they should have. I got two 1st, one 2nd, one 4th, and two 5th. Let me tell you, that’s BAD for my studio. But oh well. The next nationals are in Orlando, Florida. Can’t wait!   Convention was fun too. We had the one ballet teacher again. This time we had to do faces and be fun-key. We also had to “pet our pussycat.” Please don’t ask. The little kids thought it was great fun. We learned some cool dances. If you want, I’ll teach you the Tanto. Yay Tanto!   Well yea, that’s Vegas for you. I’ll be updating about my life later. My life’s too confusing now.   Bye!
