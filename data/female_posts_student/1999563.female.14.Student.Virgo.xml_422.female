Like when Jenny popped out of a corner and was like "LAURA!" and scared me so bad I triped and ran into a microphone stand and made it fall over. Bekah just laughed. Haha. Then this one guy named Jermey was like "Come sell popcorn with me!" andI was like "No thanks..." Even though he cut his mullet he will eternally scare me. Then he liked grabbed my shirt and was like "COME SELLL POPPED CORN WITH ME!" so I kicked him and ran away. Freako rapist.  At the end of the second show Jacelin (I totally cannot spell her name!) and I we hidding in the balconey and whenever Bekah would pass by we would yell "BEKKKKKKAHHHHHH!!!!!"  then hide behind the railing. She never even noticed. Haha. So then we told her afterwords what we did and she was like "You did??" she laughed.   I found out who my sisters secret pal is! Its Jauclin!! and Hannah thinks its Taylor. Hahah.   I like knowing things other people don't.  Jacelin told me about this guy at her school who is her friends boyfriend and he has a list and whenever people make him mad he puts them on "The List" and I was like "Heyyyyy, that was MY idea!!" I have had a list forever!!!! Then Lauren copied me too.. Gosh, I guess I am justr to amazing for some people to handle. Righhhttt.  During one of the scenes in the play this kid named Kasey is supposed to say "Hi Fern!" (fern is one of the girls names) and he said it in the funniest voice I have ever heard. It was the voice weird guys use when they are madly in love "Hiiiiiii Phhh..ern!!"  so everyone on stage laughed so immensly hard that none of them could say their lines. I laughed too.  By the end of the second show I had gotten even sicker! Its so sad. I was so dizzy I could barley stand :(  Oh well.  Another night, another trauma- the sotry of my WONDERFUL life!! [i'm not kidding, i do have a great life!]
