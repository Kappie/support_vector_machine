I'm used to waking up at 10 now, so I have to re-adjust. Waking up at 5:30 REALLY makes the day seem longer. I just can't wait to get home! Then I can just relax...well, if I have no homework. In math today we had a sub, so I didn't do the assignment. Then again I think the majority of our 13 person class didn't do it either, so that's good. I prolly won't worry about it. Kroese is pretty laid back when it comes to things like that. That reminds me...OPERATION TOAST! Oh yeah, that will be fun. It will spice up math class a little bit. hehe. toast. I think we're gonna do that friday, but I'm not sure. I'll have to check back with Erin and Vetta. The brilliant plans I come up with. Me and Erin decided that this week will be SEXPRESSION week. hehe. We always have weeks, but I think that this one will be fun. It's an excuse for our everyday pervertedness. All is well, all is well. Good times in the wagon! (I dunno, Alex once said that...) Yay! I've wasted maybe 10 minutes. Ugh! I think Im gonna talk to my mom today about seeing Josh, cuz that needs to happen soon! I am excited for it. Oh, I found it really funny when I went to go tell Amanda. I was like 'Amanda, I have something to tell you!' and she was like 'What? Are you and Josh going out?' It was really funny. So that made it a lot easier since she guessed it. I dunno. Well I think i've written enough about really nothing, so I shall be going! Away I go! (I really honestly do not know....haha)
