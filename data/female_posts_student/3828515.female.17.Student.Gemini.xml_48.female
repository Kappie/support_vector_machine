Today was Nicole's birthday, so we decided to go to Caribou and hang there for a while. Jake showed up earlier than the rest of us because he apparently didn't hear that we were all coming at 7:30 or so... I was the second to arrive, so I sat outside and talked with Jake for a while. I saw Erica there (I hadn't seen her in a while) with Tim, and I was disappointed to see that she has really let herself go and is smoking and stuff. She even told me when I said "hello" that she wasn't sure if I would recognize her or not. We spoke very briefly about college and all that... Anyways... Steph and Poawtah showed up, so we went inside and talked for a bit. Jake left to "run errands" :P, and Nicole and Steph and I had some interesting discussions about various stuff. It was all in all a good time. I decided to leave at 10 because my mom wanted me to be home around then... So yeah. That was my day.     Last song I listened to:   Magic Bus  by The Who.    Last album I listened to:   The Best Of The Who: The Millennium Collection .    Last meal I ate:  Corned beef hash, eggs, and toast.    Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .    Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .    Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  We were talking about band at Caribou... And how much we're going to miss going to U of I :'(.    Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I do not know.    Last person I talked to:  Melissa.    Favorite song today:   Annie Waits  by Ben Folds.    Favorite food today:  Tangerine sour Altoids.    Most interesting thing I did today:  Went to Caribou.
