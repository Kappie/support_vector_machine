I haven't been getting a lot of sleep, but every morning I keep waking up, knot in my stomach, and even though I'm still really tired I cannot get back to sleep.  I had thought the knot would go away after the end of the semester, but it is still there.  I am always nervous about something, and I just can't get rid of the feeling.  I am beginning to thing there is something wrong with me...Then again, perhaps it is just post-semester confusion - I don't know what to do with myself.
