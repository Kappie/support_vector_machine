Contradicting himself, and the stupidity. Oh it was crazy. I suggest everyone see this movie, especially Bush supporters, though I know they won't because they wouldn't want to see anything antiBush, even if it is all true. I'm speaking from experience, and I know not all Bush supporters would be like that, but the ones I know are. I found out there's another documentary on 9/11 and after. It's called  urlLink 911: The Road to Tyranny , by Alex Jones, and it actually came out two years ago. It says a lot more than Moore did, and doesn't just point to Bush, but to the government as a whole, including the CIA and the Pentagon. This one has to be my favorite thought:  FBI TRAINING MANUALS THAT ARE BEING GIVEN TO POLICE DEPARTMENTS THAT STATE THAT CHRISTIANS, GUN OWNERS, AND "THOSE WHO MAKE FREQUENT REFERENCES TO THE US CONSTITUTION" ARE TERRORISTS  Gotta love that, right. I like  urlLink this flyer  not because of its protest to Moore's film getting praise when Jones did it first, but because of what's below the bold, black line, which gives more info on what happened during 9/11. I also found on a  urlLink British online news site  an article, which had one sentence that really caught my attention:  "Throw Bush out, throw Bush out," an audience in California's Orange County, a conservative stronghold, chanted as the lights went up after one showing.  One thing I don't like is the now supposed link between Moore and The Carlyle Group, who he bashes in the film as an organization profiting from the war and such, that they are now part owners of Loews Cinemas which is showing his film. What the hell does that mean? Doesn't mean he's directly linked with them or anything. It could be a ploy to stop his movie after all. Oh well, that's the New World Order for you.  Here are some sites worth looking at:   urlLink infowars.com   urlLink underreported.com   urlLink americanfreepress.net   urlLink prisonplanet.com   Stay informed people. Knowledge is power, and it is the only power we have against a corruption to the highest degree.
