My dad is out of town, Libby's "party" is tomorrow and I am really excited.  I found out that hoops wasn't invited to the "party" but hoops thinks that they would just be bored.  Besides it was only just supposed to be a get together but we had to say it was a "party" for me to go.  Well over and out!             Love Lily
