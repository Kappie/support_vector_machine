It was a pretty good setup there and there was a fat bonfire. Today I have to collect for the salvation army at 2pm, I'm taking my new puppy..yeah, I got a new puppy...it' s cute ey shegs?   Shegs: Yes, very. *nod nod*  Yeah, shegs is here. Arrrrgh my lips hurt, they are all cracked. Shiva just asked if my top lip was swolen, UM NO IT'S JUST LIKE THAT!! THANKS!!!!! *sniff* TT_TT Anywhoooo, you should have gone Benji, we had SO much fun!! We got free alcohol off Jeremy and beer dude (don't know name) Shiva just informed me his name was "Murray". Yeah, so next time you should go, actually you shouldn't because we have corupted your poor little EE mind enough and James will get angry. HAha bogan. Lol, you are so stupid Maya.
