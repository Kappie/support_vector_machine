Friday was also the third installment of  urlLink Louder Than Words  at the Bowery Poetry Club.  I almost didn't go because Steve didn't want to go with and I hate having to sit alone but then I remembered I was going there for a  urlLink friend , and I'm sure I'd know at least ONE person there.  Thanks  urlLink Diane !    In my humble opinion the show started up a bit rocky.  Eric and Guy started debating the war, and then a slightly looney woman started arguing with them from the audience.  Now, audience participation is great, but this debate went on too long and the woman was too long winded.  Then Guy changed the subject back to Slam and Nationals and such.   urlLink RAC  and  urlLink Keith Roach  were the special guests and they both did two pieces each.    Problem was, there was no segue.  They went from debating the war to RAC doing a poem that had nothing to do with war.  It didn't quite flow as well as it could have...BUT they still made it work.  It was very cool to see RAC up there with her bold personality and Keith all laid back going back and forth about Slam, and actually arguing about Group Piece poems and the new format of the slam competition.  Also, the addition of  urlLink Cristin O'Keefe-Aptowicz  as a co-host was cool too.    Actually, I commented on something! (and I'm actually glad that the wireless mic wasn't working because I didn't really want to use it...) RAC was talking about how at National's the Urbana team will do whatever pieces they want to do instead of playing to win.  I asked, "Are you sure that EVERYONE on the team feels that way, because I know Taylor plays to win."  I was under the impression that  urlLink Taylor Mali , even if he's not on an Urbana team, coaches it no matter what.  They set me straight right away!  Sadly, it seems like some people on the Urbana team get overshadowed by other members, sometimes even if they aren't even ON the team, so this year they want to make a statement to show off who they are and shine out there at Nationals.  Kudos to them.  I really hope they are able to win this competition solely on merit and not because of gimmicks or putting the highest scoring poet up using an old piece or something.  I thought the mix of everyone on stage really worked once they started talking about the scene and whatnot, and I liked the debate they had going about the war...however, I felt that it should have been one or the other...I really hope Guy keeps doing this.  It's a great idea that will find its way soon enough.  He's talking about the next show being co-hosted by  urlLink F. Omar Telan  and  urlLink Bassey Ikpi .  I think that would be a hoot, and I'm actually looking forward to it!
