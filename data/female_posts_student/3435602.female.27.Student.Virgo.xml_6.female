I am supposed to look up a different illness every day and the management (according to my self made schedule).  But all I did was watch TV and eat.  I think I am like a bear getting ready for hibernation.  I love it.  Usually during the school year I watch 1 to 2 hours of TV per week, but I am making up for lost time!  TV and me, reunited at last as if not rift between us had ever happened.  So far I have managed to look up the management of aortic stenosis and HONK.  I love the name that illness, what a great acronym.  I have been at work for 2 weeks and have looked up 2 illnesses, to get through Harrison's I would need 2000 weeks at work!  I guess the summer is just too short.  I am really enjoying my work, mostly because I get to hear patients stories and see how somebody presents with something as supposed to what we learned in class.  The only boring part for me but really good for the patients is that there is not much in the ways of adverse outcomes to report.  My confidence in medicine is restored.  In fact none of the patients I am studying has died in 2 weeks!  That is really excellent.  People usually ask me if I am taking care of some patients or if I am a resident, I get all giggly and say no.  hehehehe, me no.  I guess in less than 2 months I will be taking care of patients, and in less than 2 years I will be a resident.  What a scary though.  Something really sad happened the other day.  An immigrant woman showed up with her only son to the ER she was dying but still fully competent and alert.  The doctor knew things were going bad and told the son that as soon as his mom would get intubated she would not come out of it and that he should try to talk to her prior to intubation because it would probably be the last time he would speak to her. He started to panic he had no idea how bad she really was.  Coming from an immigrant family I could relate and I felt so sad for him, I don't know if I were to lose my family what I would do.  It is just horrible.  Prior to med school I used to love watching those "life in the ER shows" and it always made me angry when doctors that came from really affluent families commented on the fact that they felt really sorry for their well to do patients when they went skiing and broke their neck or something.  They would then add, this people are just like me as supposed to the teenager that shows up with a broken neck from a bullet wound.  I supposed I am just like them I felt so sad for that guy because I can relate to him, I guess we are better able to empathize when we can actually put ourselves in the shoes. !
