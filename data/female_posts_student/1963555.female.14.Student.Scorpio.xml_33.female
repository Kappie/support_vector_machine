So I'm cramming 3 weeks of work into 1 day. Ha yeah...... So how's it going? Last night we rented a bunch of movies and got chinese food. It was great. I got some comboof scary movies and my mom got Goodfellas, my dad got hunt for red october and we also got Home Alone for good times sake...... I used to have such a crush on that little boy. I can't spell good today so I'm not even gonna try his name. So I gotta go bye Q:  How is it that eight year old in Home Alone was able to kick the old guys' ass?
