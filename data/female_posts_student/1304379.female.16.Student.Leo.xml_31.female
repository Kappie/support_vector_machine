My study-mood has long been gone! AHHH. Geog/ EM tomorrow. I guess it's probably because the last time I took my MYEs was in 2002?  Anyway, I was late today, which was "odd", considering the fact that I've been going to school on time early for egg-years. WHY? Coz my dad went to Thailand, thus no transport = must take bus. HAHAH! Damn it la.  Agne's coming back on Saturday. And thanks to Agnes, Erin and Merser for being the first few people who wished me a Happy Birthday in advance. It's not in June. It's on the 27th of JULY! HAHAH! Weird.   Fumbling his confidence  And wondering why the world has passed him by  Hoping that he's bent for more than arguments  And failed attempts to fly, fly
