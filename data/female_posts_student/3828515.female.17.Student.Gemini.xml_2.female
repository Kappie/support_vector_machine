Then we drove for pretty much the rest of the day and got home at about 9:15 tonight. The pictures I took in Canada should be posted on my profile by the time you read this, so feel free to check them out.     Last song I listened to:   Requiem  by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.    Last album I listened to:   Re-Load .    Last meal I ate:  A McChicken and some fries at McDonald's.    Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .    Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .    Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I do not know.    Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  Don't know.
