I haven't quite decided exactly what I'lluse thisspace for yet, at the moment it't just a place to blab about anything and everything dojoin in :).  I've got no holiday left :( yesterday was the official last day of school holidays it's back to college on Monday... good and bad things go with that move... good I get to catch up with everyone, bad more work more study more stress hrmm lots more bad than good there at the moment.  Oh well I'll live. That's all for now folks as this is getting rather uninteresting.
