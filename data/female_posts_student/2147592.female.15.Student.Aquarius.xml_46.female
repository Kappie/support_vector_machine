I really don't like what I see when I look at myself, I just hate being Jess Sturt. No one else had to suffer through this, I just don't wanna be me, it's like that song that Pink sang. Well I really like this song, so if you can, download it, I can't because my computers funny.  Train - Drops Of Jupiter (Yes Clur, it's teh one written on your pencil case!!!) Now that she's back in the atmosphere With drops of Jupiter in her hair eah eah eah She acts like summer and walks like rain Reminds me that there's time to change eah eah eah Since the return from her  stay on the moon She listens like spring and she talks like June eah eah eah  But Tell me did you sail across the sun Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights faded And that heaven is overrated   Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star One without a permanent scar And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there   Now that she's back from that soul vacation Tracing her way through the constellation eah eah yeah ooo She checks out  Mozart while she does tae-bo Reminds me that there's room to grow eah eah eah Now that she's back in the  atmosphere I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land   Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day And head back to the Milky Way And tell me, did Venus blow your mind Was it everything you wanted to find And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there   Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone  conversation The best soy latte that you ever had and me   Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day And head back toward the Milky Way   Tell me did you sail across the sun Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded And that heaven is overrated   Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star One without a permanent scar And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there  And did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day And did you fall for a shooting star Fall for a shooting star And are you lonely by yourself out there  They're such nice lyrics aren't they??? They are kind of like the Goo Goo Dolls. I know this must be extremely boring but this is my life, so I'll publish it anyway I want. Here's another great song:  LIMP BIZKIT    Behind Blue Eyes  No one knows what it's like  To be the bad man  To be the sad man  Behind blue eyes   No one knows what it's like  To be hated  To be fated  To telling only lies   But my dreams  They aren't as empty  As my conscience seems to be   I have hours, only lonely  My love is vengeance  That's never free   No one knows what it's like  To feel these feelings  Like I do  And I blame you   No one bites back as hard  On their anger  None of my pain and woe  Can show through   But my dreams  They aren't as empty  As my conscience seems to be   I have hours, only lonely  My love is vengeance  That's never free   Discover... L-I-M-P  I....   No one knows what it's like  To be mistreated  To be defeated  behind blue eyes   and no one knows how to say that theyre sorry  and dont worry  i'm not telling lies   but my dreams  they arent as empty  as my conscience seems to be   I have hours, only lonely  my love is vengence  that's never free   No one knows what it's like  To be the bad man  To be the sad man  Behind blue eyes  You've probably heard that one. But you gotta listen to these two aswell... This one is quite special to me, I can listen to it for hours and still not get sick of it. It's such a beautiful song aswell, guessed what it is yet?  PUDDLE OF MUDD    "Blurry"  Everything's so blurry and everyone's so fake and everybody's so empty and everything is so messed up pre-occupied without you I cannot live at all My whole world surrounds you I stumble then I crawl  You could be my someone you could be my sea you know that i'll protect you from all of the obscene I wonder what your doing imagine where you are there's oceans in between us but that's not very far  Can you take it all away can you take it all away when ya shoved it in my face explain again to me  Can you take it all away can you take it all away when ya shoved it my face  Everyone is changing there's noone left that's real to make up your ending and let me know just how you feel cause I am lost without you I cannot live at all my whole world surrounds you I stumble then I crawl  You could be my someone you could be my sea you know that i will save you from all of the unclean I wonder what your doing I wonder where you are There's oceans in between us but that's not very far  ::Chorus::LyricsCafe.com::  Nobody told me what you thought nobody told me what to say everyone showed you where to turn told you where to runaway nobody told you where to hide nobody told you what to say everyone showed you where to turn showed you where to runaway  ::Chorus::LyricsCafe.com::  Explain again to me  you take it all you take it all away... explain again to me you take it all away explain again to me take it all away explain again  And maybe just a couple more.... This is very special to me. If anyone disses it, I can only say one thing, I'll kill you (she says in dodgy accent)...  Bette Midler - Wind Beneath My Wings  Oh, oh, oh, oh - It must have been cold there in my shadow, to never have sunlight on your face. You were content to let me shine, that's your way. You always walked a step behind.  So I was the one with all the glory, while you were the one with all the strain. A beautiful face without a name for so long. A beautiful smile to hide the pain.  Did you ever know that you're my hero, and everything I would like to be? I can fly higher than an eagle, for you are the wind beneath my wings.  It might have appeared to go unnoticed, but I've got it all here in my heart. I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it. I would be nothing without you.  Did you ever know that you're my hero? You're everything I wish I could be. I could fly higher than an eagle, for you are the wind beneath my wings.  Did I ever tell you you're my hero? You're everything, everything I wish I could be. Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle, for you are the wind beneath my wings, 'cause you are the wind beneath my wings.  Oh, the wind beneath my wings. You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings. Fly, fly, fly away. You let me fly so high. Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings. Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings.  Fly, fly, fly high against the sky, so high I almost touch the sky. Thank you, thank you, thank God for you, the wind beneath my wings.
