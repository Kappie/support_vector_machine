I'm being shafted straight up the ass (non-sexually) by someone who I used to be inseperable from. I'm evidentally not talking to my best friend for the simple reason that sarcasm is dam near impossible to get across over MSN. I'm a hopless romantic who's to afraid of rejection to do a dam thing about it. I'm about to fail half of my course load. I'm quite sure I just failed my English and Social Studies exams. I have no idea what to get my sister for Christmas. And speaking of my sister: She evidentally doesn't want me as a bride's maid for her wedding. And so much more that I can't even think of right now. Everything is so fucked up right now and I don't know how to fix it. I wish I knew what was bothering my friend.  I wish I could help her.  I wish I knew why she's mad at me. I wish my mum would butt out of my sister's life.  I wish my sister would have told me that she wanted Vanessa as her bride's maid and not me.  I wish I were good at school and that I could do well on my tests instead of bullshitting my way though.   I wish I knew what to do...
