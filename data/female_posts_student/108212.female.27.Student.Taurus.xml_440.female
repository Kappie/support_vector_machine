Both of them don't have stable jobs so the income is not consistent which is har if you have consistent bills coming in.  Clay is still working in a hotel, he is on a permanent status so things are going pretty well. He has not graduated yet but he was able to produce a fake diploma through my cousin's friend. We just hope nobody in the office finds out about it.
