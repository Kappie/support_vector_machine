So I have nothing to talk about... oh, I got all 7's in SATs :P (You mean I have a brain!) No, we have a brain! It was all the extensive revising, oh and you telling me the answers was good. (Hehehe, well you might of thrown a strop if I didn't!) *Creeeeeeeek* Hey don't leave! *Yanks you back in* Ok so I am a bit weeeird but that's what make it so fun! Do you ever not see how some people can be friends with other people cause their soooo boring? Oh and Rosie was being nice... which was quitttttte weird.
