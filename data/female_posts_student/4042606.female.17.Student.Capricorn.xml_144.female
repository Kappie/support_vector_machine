It was even more suprising to hear that Ian was ready to hop on a plane to come down and see me. I thought that was very sweet, and there is no way I can put into words how much I appreciate that.  I will be out of work for a little while, I am on medication that will make me a little unsteady on my feet. They thought it would be best if I stayed home, and I also am getting paid for it. So I will be posting more than I usually do.
