Other then that, I do not appreciate you stealing my cool stuff from my posts on my blog. It shows little to no originality on your part. Perhaps I would be fine with it if you credited myself with bringing it to your attention. But you have not. What a shock.  Not directed to you>> I feel the need to vent majorly: I am really really sick of someone and I can wait till they take off and hopefully grow up. If I hear them complain or whine or falsely accuse me of one more thing I might drive a spike through their forehead.   Have a nice day.
