Maybe it's 'cause I talked slower than I normally do...huh. Odd thing is I'm the only "southerner" of my family, hehehe.  Enough obsessing over it though 'cause it's too late. I'm gonna post another tonight or tomorrow 'cause I have interesting stuff to say, plus I'm much more relaxed about it. How stupid...it's just a phone call.  I was supposed to have senior portraits done today but I didn't...I'm going another day for them. My blood sugar dropped and I just felt really sluggish. School portraits are so cheesy. More on this later, though. My head hurts.
