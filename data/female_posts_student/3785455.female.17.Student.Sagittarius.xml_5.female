I've got the feeling that you don't really give a fuck! " Not class, but that song has been on replay in my mind all day. Although I haven't evaluated whether or not it's a bad thing, it won't likely be pleasing to the people around me if it continues.  I'm getting  extremely  frustrated waiting on Mr. Judd to phone me back. I really need this job, and the fact that my future is just sitting in his hands kills me. I mean, I never wanted any part of my life to depend on someone else -- independant woman to the core; but it seems like if I don't get this job life is going to be a hell of a lot harder. Call me a wanker, but I'd love nothing more than to live the easy way for once. I remember going to a psychic on my 16th, and 17th birthday; I had been told both times that regardless of how hard things may be, or what roads I take -- I would  suceed . That thought is music to my ears, and I can only hope it's true (regardless of the stigma).  A couple of friends came by earlier, gave the apartment some life for a few hours. I'm content sitting at home, shootin' the shit by myself, but I find if company comes over I go out of my way - in a sense to keep them here. I don't know, friends love it here [minus the no-smoking thing] but I find they become just as irritated by my crowd pleasing ways. What happened to the old Stephanie? The hard-ass that told you to get your own fucking drink. Someday, she'll come out from hiding.
