Except for the bonfire night I should prob. only have 1 or 2 people over at a time. If you want to come over just call me, it's all good. I'll be there most of the time, except when I'm at play prac., visiting Lainie, or doing something random. If you need a ride I can prob pick you up.    Sun - Mande during the day, no one overnight yet  Mon - Lainie Tues - bonfire :)  Weds - no one yet  Thurs - no one yet  Fri - no one yet    Oh yeah, one other thing -- I probably won't be able to update my blog this week b/c Fran's computer doesn't work. I won't be able to read anybody else's blog either, unless I go home for awhile or go to the internet cafe or something. So yeah. Limited internet for Brit :) That just means I'll spend all my free time reading or playing card games or something.    But yeah... that's about it, so I'll see y'all this week sometime.
