We were "supposed" to be researching for/working on our rough draft of our group report on the foreign policy for the upcoming democratic convention.  However, Rajai, Seth, and Chris had to write a paper for something in English and asked me to help.  I had already read and written a paper on the Great Gatsby, which I totally aced by the way, and was like sure I'd help.  Well, needless to say, we drifted off-topic and they didn't get any work done.  The conversation all started when I was handing Pat an article about Kerry for him to use and on it was an advertisment for the "south beach diet".  Chris saw it and thought I was looking up diets and he was like OMG, Amy, don't diet.  So, for the rest of class they kidded me that I was like 500 lbs.   Throughout this conversation, I realized that they believed I had gone through a sudden "transformation".  They said things like "amy, on wednesday, when you came in with that black halter dress, we didn't even recognize you.  We said, damn, she looks so fine!"  That comment of course, made me feel good because my ego was bruised upon finding out that Sam wasn't going to ask me to prom. Now I've realized that the guys actually do notice what i wear :)       Later that afternoon, once school had let out, I went to the mall with Tracy.  After she bought shoes for graduation, we headed over to the movie theatre to see Troy. Omg, it was awesome.  I loved the sword fighting, even though there could have been more blood.  O well, it was SO worth just seeing Brad Pitt.  It was like *instant orgasm" when I saw him.  God, the rock hard chest and abs is such a big turn on for me.  hehehe     On Saturday, I had dance, which was the reason I couldn't go to HFS.  Argh! After dance, I bought a new bathing suit (even though I already have nine :) ) because my mom was like "it looks hot on you".  HAHA, wow, this coming from my mother.  Who would have thought??!  Anyways, I washed my car in my new suit and then got ready to go out.  First, I went to Dulles for a sort time, then headed out to reston.  While I was walking around, I managed to run into you guessed it....SAM, david, teddy, and jamie.  Sam proceeded to turn around literally six times to stare at me.  (Probably because I looked hot in a tiny tank top with a short miniskirt)  After saying hi, I continued to walk around, only to be stopped by some random guy telling me to get in his car.  I was like *today is not a good day to get raped*.  Upon escaping him, I sat down at a bench to talk to Laura and suddenly these guys from the top of the parking garage were like come up here.  When I didn't, they decided to come to me.  It was all good because I met this cute guy named Tom, who is a senior at Herndon and plays the guitar.  He asked for my number, which I gave him, and he said we should hang out sometime. Hmm, I wonder when he will call.  Guys never wanna seem "desperate".   *rolls eyes*  ~peace
