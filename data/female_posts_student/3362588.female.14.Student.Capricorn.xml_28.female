I've been looking on poetry.com (don't ask why). They have the 100 best poems and stuff of all times. Here's a few of them:  For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams /Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; /And the stars never rise, /but I feel the bright eyes /Of the beautiful Annabel Lee:— And so, all the night-tide, /I lie down by the side /Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride, /In her sepulchre there by the sea— /In her tomb by the sounding sea.   Last line of Annabel Lee by Edgar Allen Poe   I like the last two lines, so morbid, and sad.......  Emily Dickinson(1830–1886)    712
