I'm having a sudden shiver on my spine and a rush of hotness on my cheeks. My mind is floating again. My heart is skipping some beats again. I'm caught in this tricky feeling again.   My senses are frozen in a flash. This mouth couldn't create a word but a faint smile creating a universe in my eyes. These ears can't hear a friend calling from behind but the sweet melodies of love songs playing on my mind.   My memory is stuck at one particular glance. He called my name, said "hi" and smiled. And now, I'm floating. Ah, I think would be floating for a few minutes more.
