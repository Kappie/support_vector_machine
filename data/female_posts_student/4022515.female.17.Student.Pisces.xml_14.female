So I rushed off to be with  him , and I forgot to clock out, among other things. Going off to see  kevin  turned out to be pretty pointless because  he  broke up with me yesterday any way. I still love  him  and I deserved it. Any way, so I go into work last night and Musa, my mannager, starts yelling at me about how dining room was a mess the night before (I was suposed to close it) and how I'm irrisponsibe and stuff like that. I almost cried b/c I've never had an adult besides my parents yell at me like that. I really didnt mean to do shitty work. Ely, a coworker, is awsome tho. Hes from africa, but he speaks pretty good english. I was really sad at work last night cuz of everything with  kevin , and so Ely was like, i'll jump  him  babygirl, you need to be happy. Which I thought was really sweet, even though I completely screwed  kevin  over to say the least, but still, it made me feel better at the time.  I have to work again today, and I don't want to go becuase I think my mannager named mark is going to be there, and hes kind of a prick, and he takes all my cigs. Hes a nice guy tho, he tries so I guess it wont really be that bad after all.
