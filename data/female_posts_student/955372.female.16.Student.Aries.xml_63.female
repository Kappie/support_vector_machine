It was like tease allie day, but hey whatever I got the new Tori cd, YAY, thank you laurel!!!!! Yeah the mall was fun. Then that night I had to go to my parents friends house, that was torture... First of all I was the only SANE person there, because all the "adults" hot wasted and then there were all these little people that of course i was left to baby sit. grr. Then we watched the Royal Tenebaums which was just disturbing. I don't care if the girl is adopted it's still incest. Anywho, so the people's house we were at, their kids are so spoiled. They have their parents like completely wrapped, its really sad. They have absolutely no parenting skills at all. And my parents are all "they're not that bad" and i'm like yeah that's cuz ur not the ones who have to watch them while everyone else gets trashed and has gand ol' drunk time. hmm anywho yeah that was my day.
