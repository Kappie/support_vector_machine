The first thing my new supervisor asked me was, "Do you like to read?" My heart climaxed with excitement!! I crave knowledge and find it quickly in books, even though I use several avenues to broaden my erudition.   My new job is very satisfying, so the 70 hour work week in combination of all my jobs is a contributor to the satisfaction of my soul. Not to mention my education. I have been blessed with a reason to enjoy my lassitude.  One of my friends gave me a satisfying trapezius relaxation last night during our class break. Lifting all those books yesterday played a number on my postural muscles. I am excited to have such a physical job and thank heavens for the maintenance of massage.   Speaking of our break in class...we were supposed to watch a medically related video last night.  The wrong video was in the case, so while she was out making copies, instead of learning proper handwashing techniques we learned how to give a personal test. and breast exam.....why do these things seem to always happen to me?!!  I got to see "him" last night. He's had a haircut that looks very nice on him. Of course, he's ever beautiful.  His hair is so soft and thick and full of tortoise shell colors. I've missed him terribly. I have so many things to tell him. At least his eyes sent me the guesture of happiness to have me in view for just a moment.   It's amazing to be able to feel happiness, sadness, longing, and desire all within the same realm of time within my being. Today I will be content; at peace with all that has come into my presence. I still have an unsatisfied need that I must ask my heart to guide me through. Asking continuance? Asking release? Only time will tell the nature of what I can endure through this lonliness. Have patience, your breath containing compassion and joy. Find a way to release your love so not to overfill your heart. Make room for the emptiness you must maintain to be ever flowing. Can I not say, I love him? For within that is such power to let go. To become a more loving creature of the universe. Your love, may you spread wide and far to the depths of all hearts who may share in your passion.  With love,  BLG
