Whenever I go over there she talks about how sexy my legs are and then gives me tonssss of food. If she offers me a snack and I say okay then she gives me half a cake practically and I eat five bites and done with it and then feel bad x.x and if I say I'm not hungry then she gives me an entire cake almost!!! She insaneeee she also always calls my auntie and makes herbe her slave and go to the store when it's way outta her way to get her stupid things. She smokes alot, can't drive, and can't breathe. I guess she pretty nice though she just weird. She really fat anda while ago I saw a piccie of her from when she was 20 and she was stick skinny and really really pretty so I said something like, "Wow grandma used to be alot skinnier than she is now"to my aunt andmy grandma was in the room eeeeeeep. I so stupid.She justlaughed though and said I wasa "cheeky wee monkey" hehe old people's insults are funny.      Today I went to price club and my aunt actually bought food that didn't have fat and grease as the main ingredient. Yay because if I have to eat fast food for dinner one more night in a row Iam gonna puke. Ivery sick and feel all achy and tired.=( *pullscovers over head*       baiiiii
