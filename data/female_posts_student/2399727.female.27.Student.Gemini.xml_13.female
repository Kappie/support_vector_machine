And before you know it, it won't be Christmas anymore.  Last year we had a big blizzard on Christmas and spent much of the day shoveling.  This year it's still green and quite mild.  I don't mind not shoveling but it does detract a bit from the spirit of the season to see so much green grass.  More to come...
