I'm so chocolate.. but it's so nice~ anw.. this indian classmate of mine went too.. I nv liked her.. ever since e start of my JC life.. she's jus such an irritant.. n a typical caveman! n her hairstyle is so bombastic tt a pen wld even stuck in there if u try to throw into tt bush of hair! haha.. couldn't stand her at all.. wads worse was tt my teachers keep grouping me togt wif her during grp assignments! I was always so close to killing her when having discussions.. haha.. she jus speaks in such a soft volume tt u need to listen to her so carefully to hear anything.. n e reason she gave was she was conscious abt her voice.. oh man.. I nearly died-ed on e spot.. n she talks in this like super perfect english.. n act in this dramatic way everytime.. tt u wldnt expect to see in real life... haha.. its like those things u see actor acting when they're acting.. get it? haha.. she's so ultimate.. haha..
