Basically I can remember watching The Monkeys (my five year old hear went THUMP thump for Mr. Davey Jones), The Smurfs ("Papa Smurf! Papa Smurf!"), and the only two shows that PBS had to offer back then: Sesame Street and Reading Rainbow.   For me, Reading Rainbow was one of those shows like (when actually did get cable) Leave it to Beaver or Dennis the Menace. As kids never actually watched those shows voluntarily; we only watched them because there was nothing else on. We grew to resent everything filmed in black and white that wasn't about a talking horse or a red-headed lady who was always pissing off her Cuban husband. I also grew to resent Reading Rainbow for being on right after Sesame Street yet RR didn't have any talking puppets or lively animation. I watched it reluctantly and with disdain.   But now Reading Rainbow is fast becoming one of my favorite shows (I'm serious). My adult heart goes Thump Thump for Mr. Lavar Burton, although I think he might be gay. But nevertheless, I recently learned about Native American pottery, bats, and medicine men in the Amazon. There is more content in Reading Rainbow, a kids' show, than there is in most primetime television.   All of this nostalgic TV watching has also inspired me to re-read some of my old favorites as a kid (thankfully I have a ten year old niece whom I can use as an excuse). I am happy to report that the Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle series really IS that good.
