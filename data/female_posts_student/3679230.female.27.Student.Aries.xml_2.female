One of my really good Canadian friends and I have had a long ongoing email discussion about 'home' and what the heck that is, anyway.  Is Canada your home if you're a hyphanated Canadian (i.e. a German-Canadian, an Indian-Canadian or a Ukrainian-Canadian)?  How does race place into this - do 'other people' consider it more quaint and cute when the Ukrainian-Canadians keep their traditions for a century than when the Indian-Canadians keep theirs for a couple of decades?  Are the non-white Canadians required to make Canada 'home' more and quicker than white immigrants?  Is Sweden my home even if I spend 11 months out of 12 away from it?  I don't know.  We never figured it out.  Maybe home is a concept and not a geographical place, 'home is where the heart is' and stuff like that.  I'm supposedly 'home' right now, that is, I'm in Sweden.  I'm not entirely sure that's home though.  Home is my apartment in Melbourne.  Melbourne feels a bit like home as well.  Australia, however, isn't home but Sweden is.  But there is no place in Sweden that's home.  At the moment I just want to go home to my chook, but at the same time it feels like home would be anywhere she is.  I did field work for my thesis all of last week.  I went up to Stockholm and hung around a study tour that was part an international development project for Ukrainian women.  The whole purpose of me being there is trying to figure out how these women see gender and gender roles and if a project like this one can ever change values and norms in Ukraine.  But what was really weird is that I closeted myself throughout the whole thing except for one conversation when I was a bit drunk after a dinner and was talking to the Swedish consultants.  While these Ukrainian women were mostly really progressive in their gender thinking for being Ukrainian I just couldn't bring myself to out myself infront of everyone.  They are SO focused on family, family is really important to them, so when they heard that I live in Australia because of my 'partner' everyone wanted to know all about my life there with 'him'.  I never said yeah, it's a guy, but I never said anything to make them believe the opposite either.  I spent a week trying to talk about my chook in gender-neutral terms.  That's really shit and I shouldn't have.  Live as you learn blah blah.  I guess I just didn't feel confident enough to do it and it pisses me off.
