I think that the Bio quiz went pretty good and there were only a couple questions on the back that I got confused on cause they were like those questions where you had to choose between option A or B.  I forgot to put my name on it though and realized afterwards.  I also forgot my name on the lab we did the other day.  I think what happened is that I wanted to get all that stored up info in my brain out and when I did the quiz and got it all out I worried about the info, but I forgot the simple part - my name.  When I told Mrs. J that I forgot my name she made like this comment that I actually kind of thought was rude - but really I don't think she was trying to be rude, that is just how I interpreted it I think.  She was like "What's with this name thing?"  At least of what I remember it was something like that.  I kind of got offended because I can't help that I keep forgetting to put my name on things.  How am I suppose to remember that?!?  If I don't remember, then I just don't remember.  In English we had a sub and we hardly did anything.  She just assigned a story to read and that was that.  So I read the story and then had free time so I played some games on the comp and finished off my bio.  Then I had active living.  SOOOOO FUNNNNN!!!  We played kinball and that was my first time playing it, but like the people on my team were so nice and awesome.  I had so much fun.  Our team even won, and we beat the four other teams.  Now I am just sitting here thinking about my day.  I am really having a big issue with my weight.  I keep eating alot, and I am gaining some weight.  I feel like I should stop, but sometimes I just have to keep going.  What happens if like for a week I will gorge on anything and everything.  Then the next week after I find that I have gained weight so I barely eat anything.  Of course it would be a lie to say that I don't like food - because I do.  I just don't know how to control that part of me right now.  Sometimes it's very easy, but at other times it is very difficult.  I am REALLY REALLY going to try eat alot more healthier and try not to gorge.
