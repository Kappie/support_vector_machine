Josh:  Could we also add Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to the song list? Also, we're going to have some cds going so you can socialize and play Skip it.  Abby obviously talked to you if you know about the whole ben Folds Five thing, and all that, so that should all be taken care of.  We (me, you and abby, since we're the planners of this party) need to get together to plan this cause it's going to be huge.  I think we have almost 60 on the guest list right now.    Rosie:  This is me laughing at your sunburn.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!  Now you know what us fair skinn-ed people feel like. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!  OK, I feel a bit better. as to the sewing thing, I'm going to sew me a costume, and Abby's mom will probably sew her one, but they're hard to make, as well as expensive, so neither of us will probably do anyone else's.  I may do josh a kilt, because it's so worth it.  And then...I'm right here, where are you?  OK, I think that's it for you.  NEXT!!!  Will:  God, I love you.  Your comment just made the whole day worthwhile.    Liz: Hi.  You didn't post whilst I have been gone, so I can't respond to you.  Abby:  I think I'm going to be Scarlet from Gone with the Wind.  I think that would be fun, though it might be kind of hard to maneuver in...hmmm.  I'm definitely thinking Strawberry Shortcake for you.  Um, and what's this Baskin Robbins thing on Saturday?  That sounds fun.  And um... yes, Josh will definitely love Zoolof.  I'm sorry I left you without telling, but I tried calling and no one was home, and I hate answering machines.  And... i think that's it, but I'm being rushed off the computer, so if I think of something else, I'll tell you.  Go read what I told Josh, and that should cover most everything I missed.
