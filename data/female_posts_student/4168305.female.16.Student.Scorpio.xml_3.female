The Stress Test:  You exhibit a Stress Factor of   ((( 16% )))   - which barely registers. Get a job, hippie!   The Death Test:  You can expect to die on:   Thursday, January 9th 2059   at the tender age of   71   years old. On that date, you will most likely die from: Cancer (10%), Alcoholism (4%), Alien Abduction (4%), Homicide (3%)   The Jerk Test:  The results are in... you are certifiably   ((( 25% )))   Jerk! That's lower than the worldwide average of 28%!    The IQ Test:  The results have been tabulated, and your IQ is...   ((( 103 )))   That's about average for your age and sex.   The Love Test:  You are officially...   ((( 8% )))   in Lust! That's lustier than the worldwide average of 21% in love! Is it a bird? A plane? Is it a boy? A girl? Is it love, or is it lust? Ah, you. You are that rare mix of sensitive and sensual, romantic and randy, pride and prejudice, etc. When you see your crush, you waffle like a Belgian, unsure of whether you'd rather paint their toes or suck on their toes. Poets have long been puzzled by your kind. You'll never fall for robots or nymphos, but you will suffer longs bouts of marriage.   The Unintelligence Test:  The results are in! You are...   ((( 61% )))   Untelligent! Your score is close to the current worldwide average of 64%. Here is the custom report of your personality than led our team of geeks to conclude (with confidence) that you are a moderate but   excitingly different woman  : "The subject shows an astounding level of intelligence, and her sense of observation is one of her best qualities. Considering this, she shows a lot of potential, but that's only part of the equation. The subject is brave, however, and shows real strength in that department. Courageousness is a large part of untelligence. Finally, the subject displayed a poor (and a little bit boring) sense of humor, a nearly satanic lack of morality, and a complete lack of self-confidence. The balance of these three traits is important; high levels of confidence, medium levels of morality, and a good level of humor make for the strongest individuals."   The Greed Test:  Greedy animal! You are certifiably:   ((( 25% )))   Greedy! That's lower than the Worldwide Greed Average of 35%!    The Gender Test:  It all adds up... we feel   ((( 36% )))   certain that you are... A Woman! How do we know? Well, deep down, your gender affects everything about you, from your favorite number to your views on Canada. Many women who took the test think and act just like you, as you can see from the graph above. Statistically speaking, you are a woman - whether you know it or not.   The Dateable Test:  Hot Cha! You are:   ((( 42% )))   Dateable! That's lower than the Worldwide Dateability Average of 63%! You are neither more nor less dateable than your peersâ€” welcome to the land of mediocrity, home of the masses! You have an undeniable animal magnetism, but you're just as likely to attract small animals as you are to attract human beings. Nevertheless, the people you flirt with generally find you funny and cute, or "fute." You have good hygiene, which is an imporant aspect of relationships involving two or more people. Avoid seafood and walks in the woods.   The Personality Test:    You are a Dreamer!   (Submissive Introverted Abstract Feeler) - reserved and imaginative. You are basically the shy, silent type. You don't have much interest in facts and figures or most of what's going on around you, but the internal worlds you build for yourself are rich and complex. Luckily, your creativity and strong heart mean you have a deep personality evident to anyone who gets to know you. It's just that not many people do. Talk to yourself less, other people more.    The Wench Test:  The results are in... thou art:   ((( 37% )))   Wench! That's equal to the worldwide average of 37%!    Wow... I've had such a fun day taking all those tests.  *Sarcasm*  Anyway, maybe that shows a better insight to the sort of person I am.
