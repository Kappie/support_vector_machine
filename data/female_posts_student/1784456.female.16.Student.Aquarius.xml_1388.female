And then I go on it... and no one's on. Oh, and I used to go on this chatroom, where I knew every one (and was a foot) *...* And I was gonna go back on... but then I realised that I haven't been on it for years and I wouldn't know any one! I need a community! (Jeez) Hmm... I was thinking about taking Tae Bo classes or some thing (with Laura of course) or maybe ruling the word. (Learning to spell would be better) Sorry about randomness, I've been playing on LF2 : Little Fighter 2! It's so much fun! You get to kill people! In the game of course... ^_^
