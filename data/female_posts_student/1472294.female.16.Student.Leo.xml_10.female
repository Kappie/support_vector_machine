I think it is because they renovated the place and J8 was featured in The Straits Times a few days ago AND there is this BIG MEGA PROJECT that was going on and our school was chosen. It is actually a stall you would be setting up and sell all kinds of stuff in order to earn money and PROFITS $_$. And GB, NPCC, ART club and others were set up in May and the weather was very very hot! We were sweating profusely in the open space although it was very fun and exciting. I did not even know there was this 'House Rabbit Society Singapore'. Their stall was very cool with their hand- printed items like bookmarks, postcards and keychains. I bought a bookmark for $2 and my friend bought postcards and bookmarks. This society is actually to help reduce the number of unwanted pets and improve rabbits' lives through education. Hmmm, very meaningful but I can't join as they need a membership dee of S$25 and I don't have a pet right now... I send away my CUTE quails a year ago, and I never even take photos of them. :~ The reason was that my brother and I could not have the time to take care of them (It was given to my brother in Pri 6 as his Birthday present -_-) So, all I could say that looking after a pet is a life- long responsibility. DON'T EVER ABANDON YOUR PETS ! ! ! To check out the House Rabbit Society Singapore, the website is ---  http://www.hrss.net/  Happy surfing!
