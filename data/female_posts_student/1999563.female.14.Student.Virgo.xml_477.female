I don't know the least about to say to some random guy that you think its attractive. Snapp.. Hmm. I have improv practice tonight. Its kinda scary. I hope I can be funny. I want to go to that thingy Sara goes to but, alas, I cannot. *sigh*  Lalala.    Tomorrow I have school, tennis, and church. Hmm. I hope they have cookies again at church. :) Ioveee coookies!
