And how do you define good. restraining all our strong emotions that whell up. We have no choice but to react on them. Its human nature- how do you survive without yourself? You can't replace it with some name. A nonexistant presence that you want to believe loves you, and looks out for you and protects you.  When so many good ppl have died along with the bad.  A kid who did everything in his life good and helped ppl, He even died to save his friends life. Why the hell would a god let someone like that die?....he was interfering with His ownwork?... in weakness and when we can't handle our own consequences, we create a face, and a word to comfort. Something non human, stronger than anyone you know. b.c. you know that ppl can fail you. Ppl are just like you. How could they help?  but a god.... an almight being omniscient, omnipotent... why would you want that? why would anyone want to be watched, and feel they have to worship and give back to a god, who made them weak in the first place, just so that we'd look up to it. And make it feel all powerful.  Like a person retarding a kid just so that it wont ever know better, and will think you're the greatest, even tho you leave for months at a time. Never give it what it wants. Pit the entire world against it. and have to nerve to make me feel like i am without. and im somehow am less until i conform with these specific rules that stiffle my individuality and person?  "Have you excepted christ as your personal savior? He'll be waiting..."  -ya, thats what i'm afraid of.
