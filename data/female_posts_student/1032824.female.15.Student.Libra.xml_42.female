Why i am crying over stupid things and wasting time on stupid things. because im a stupid fool. people take me for granted. people don't care about how i feel. people say this, people say that. since nobody likes the current pearlyn then let's see how it would be like if i were to be stricter, firmer, much much more hard-hearted, bitchier, more selfish, insensitive, inconsiderate and loud.   I currently really hate my life. things are messy. and i just quarelled with my little sister and  i am crying . this is what i get after a tirin day at school. i am already  so drained  from every fucking thing. school. tests. [him]. npcc. homework. friends. annoying sisters. kayaking tests. tuitions. myself. like wow i'm already almost 15 and i am  actually  crying because i think my life sucks. i was SO born a loser hey.  God must hate me, cursed me for eternity.
