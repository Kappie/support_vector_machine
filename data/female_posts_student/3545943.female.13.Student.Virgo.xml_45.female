But despite my nonchalant attitude about organization at home, my school supplies must be perfect.  There is a place for everything and everything in its place.  I have everything I need on hand, as well as back-up supplies.  Why do I get this way?  I think it's my distinction between home and school.  They are separate things, and I have different attitudes in each.  School is work, work must be organised.  I feel that in the future, the same distinction will be made between work and home.  I do not necessarily need or even want them to effect each other.  They can be two separate entities for me.
