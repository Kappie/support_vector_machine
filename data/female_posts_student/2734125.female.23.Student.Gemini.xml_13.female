It was my last night there, and we walked into the university district to see Big Fish.  When I want to see a movie, I get somewhat compulsive about it.  It was Big Fish or nothing damn it.  So, we walked, and stood in a very long line filled with hip people, and then were very hungry after.  We stoppped by a market to grab some food to cook at my Tod's sister's abode, and there, in the plant section, was a mini iris.  It was so fantastic that I stared at it until Tod came to find out what was so great.  Tiny pot, perfectly formed little flowers, all under six inches high.  The jittery super market lights that are universal slowed to a constant summer glow, and shown in a halo about this science fiction strange wonder.  What artistic genetic scientist had thought this up?  The spell was broken once Tod pointed out that it would not enjoy flying at all.  Alas.  I thought that it was just a Washington thing, seeing as you think about a seed there and it grows.  Most things are not, of course, as perfectly small as this plant was, but what could be.  I went home, happy that I would see the sun, over joyed that it would be dry, jumping excitedly that I would see my friends, but slightly mournful that I would most likely never again see a mini iris.  Yet, the next night, as I powel our very own super market plant section, trying to buy myself some flowers that will not wilt (or at least will live to bloom again) mini iris.  They sit now on my desk, in the pale winter light, getting misted occationally by my loving hand.  Peace.
