We did some catching up and he was surprised when I told him the real reasons that Nate and I broke up. Nate did A great Job of avoiding me the ENTIRE time, in fact it was quite obvious that it was deliberate avoidance. Nate looked really hot though in the play...and I couldnt take my eyes off him. The play required alot of sitting for him on stage and everyone had a blank look as they stare off the the side, or stare forward, but I caught his eyes many times stareing at me. God It made me miss him so bad...and then they're was intermission. Dan thought it would be quite interesting to see what would happen if I met the girl that Nate wanted to break up with me for...because dan is a drama queen. So I met her...she's really pretty and I guess I can't blame him because compared to me she's alot better looking...and then she left after an uncomfortable meeting, and then dan told me. "We've been talking backstage, Nate and I, and he misses you". He just had to say it didnt he.     So the play finished up and the cast started mingling amoung the audience...except for Nate...who again hid the entire time...   I miss him. I hate this. I want him to go away. I have to go to school.
