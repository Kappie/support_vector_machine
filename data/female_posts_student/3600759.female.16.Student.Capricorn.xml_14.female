It was VERY VERY VERY hot in school the past two days so everyone was tired, hot and sweaty and the school did have an off smell. Tomorrow I have to leave for the HOBY youth leadership seminar for the entire weekend! Should be fun! I can't wait to work. But I don't start till the 19th but still I am SO excited! I love working at Splish Splash it is so much FUN, the friends you make are the best! And it is always fun. Yea well school is over (finally) and now all I have to do is take a Bio final, then 4 regents' (Bio, Global, Math, and Spanish) should be fun (yea right) Ok well I should probably get going. I'll update later on maybe! Summerland is on tonight I can't wait!!!!!!! Ok well talk to everyone later. Happy end of school! We are FINALLY JUNIORS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Next year is going to be absolutly CRAZY, so much to do in one year (prom, acution, SAT's, crazy tests, being second oldest in the school, and so much more) Talk to everyone later, love you all. Later! ~~~~~Mel~~~~~
