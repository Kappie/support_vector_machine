Understandably everyone feels nervous and such before opening night, feels that we aren't ready, and sure...that's normal, but we've never been THIS unprepared before.  Not even half the cast has lines memorized.  We have no lighting yet. Our lighting might just turn out to be just on and off.  Set isn't completely done.  We open friday, newspaper guy is coming wednesday, and the teachers are invited to the thursday performance.  Super.    I'm in a really bad mood, but it's not just the play.  I feel I should keep my emotions to myself for if I rant now I may later find myself regretting having let anyone read them at all.  I find letting other people into my own emotional problems only makes things worse for myself.  Though it may feel good at first, later I feel guilty for dumping all my personal shit on them, why should anyone else have to deal with my problems? And I don't need to feel guilty, and I don't want to pity myself, I already hate myself enough for that.  It's stupid to pity myself and I have no real reason to, though my mind sometimes suggests otherwise.  I'm done.
