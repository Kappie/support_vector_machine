I actually got into it, if you could believe that. I guess it's because I'm a detailed oriented person. I believe I really could turn into one of those people who  become obsess with the appearance of their car. My friend Kristine is one of them. She used to wax her car so much that the top was so smooth and slick that it was impossible to sit on. But she's a little less intense now. Well I have that UC essay...still...due this Monday...I should go....
