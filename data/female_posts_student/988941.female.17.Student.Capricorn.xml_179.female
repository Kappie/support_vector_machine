Perhaps they do go overboard but things like the recent Columbia crash will affect many things, like September 11th. War on Iraq will constantly be in the papers like it is now I guess but that will have a lasting effect. Some people like myself, like to read everything that happened ie: minute by minute, others don't but they have enough there for everyone I think. Plus your point about darren proves how its godo to know what is going on. Say your sister was in New York when that happened you'd want to know, even if you knew she was ok, what was happening and what was going on. So they are goo din that sense but yes, they do have it on the front page longer than people want to see it. I see your point.   -edit- Jackie just deleted her last post which this was replied to
