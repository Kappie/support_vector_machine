It’s turning out to be a huge problem.  I can’t seem to get my transcript from a college I attended in California.  It’s the last thing they’re waiting for, and when I called  urlLink Victor Valley College  today they told me that they seemed to have lost my file completely.  GGGRRRRRRR!!!!!!  I just want to scream and yell and call them idiots…I am getting a serious lesson in tolerance!  I am not the most patient, not at all.  It’s like, hurry up and wait, hurry up and wait, hurry up and wait! How aggravating.  So now, VVC is looking for my transcript.  They say they’ll call me and I hope they find it.  I would hate to have to send another one but I think I am going to have to.  It may be for the fall semester, which doesn’t start for 3 months but I want everything to be in line when I am ready to register for school.  It just makes me want to scream.  I can’t even get accepted or declined because of that lost transcript.  So now, I get to sit and pray for the recovery of that lost transcript.  College should not be this difficult.  I think that those of you who know me know that I am not this patient.  I am trying to get my education in English so that I can be a writer.  I really need to get out of college and on with my life, but with all this red tape I can’t even get in.  I almost want to just stay in Jr. College and get my associates degree and say fuck it to my Bachelors degree.  Now, don’t get me wrong, I know that it’s not the best idea.  I really want to get my Bachelors degree.  Well, well, well…I just got a phone call from VVC and it seems that they not only found my file, they sent out the transcripts two weeks ago.  So I called  urlLink Tarleton  and this is a problem on their side.  They’re behind and so it will be next week before they know anything.  Sometimes the problem is not where you believe it to be.  So those that I prejudged, those that I called idiots, aren’t.  The people I thought weren’t idiots, are.  It’s a small world after all…  Ahh, the waiting game, the incessant waiting, how I hate it!  ~Kristyn (with a **sigh**)
