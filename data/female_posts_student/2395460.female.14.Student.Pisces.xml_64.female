Unless the   urlLink   I, Robot  trailer   was deliberately bad, so that audiences would be pleasantly surprised by the real thing, this robot is going to be firing his agents in pretty short order. At least  urlLink Isaac Asimov  won't have to watch. The new first law of robotics? Read the  urlLink classic book of short stories  instead.  If you want to see an intelligent, thought-provoking movie about robots, check out  urlLink Greg Pak's   urlLink  Robot Stories  . Pak's film explores the human side of a future shared with robots in a series of four vignettes. The brilliant  urlLink Rania Ho  designed the egg-like, somewhat low-tech-looking surrogate child in the first story,  My Robot Baby , and it's a hilarious visual gag on the chicken eggs kids have to nurture in junior-high Health class. I liked the last story the best,  Clay , in which an elderly man must decide whether or not to upload himself into a Matrix-like computer and discard his ailing body. Sab Shimono is amazing as the man who's not quite sure if his uploaded wife is really his wife or just a set of 1s and 0s masquerading as his lost love.  It's only showing in select cities now, but hopefully will get a wider release soon.   Watch the  urlLink  Robot Stories  trailer .
