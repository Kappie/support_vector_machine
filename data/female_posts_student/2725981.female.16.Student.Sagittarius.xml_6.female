What better excuse than trading the old for a new one while all the site changes are going on. To be prefectly honest, I was surprized at the changes. Its weird, but not really bad. I dont know. Honestly, I'm putting off writing an essay for this HUGE World Civ. test that's going on tomorrow. I hate essays, and this is coming from someone who has always loved english...with a passion. I'm wild about reading and writing short stories, and I'm getting into poetry a little (not that I'm any good at it).  I'm bored...I really want to just leave school and go hang out somewhere with someone interesting. A coffee shop, a book store, a concert, a club, anything. Hell, I'd even go to the movies with a complete stranger, that's how bored I am. Its getting to be the end of the year, and all I want to do is stop with the homework and tests and everything and just go to the beach and live there forever. I'd build myself an unstable hut out of non-existant palm leaves and drink smoothies for breakfast. I'd sit out on the beach with no one else for miles and tan and then I'd go swimming or teach myself better surfing skills or write stories or letters or I'd write in this blog on a lap-top that I'd get between leaving school and the hut building. It would be great.  I dont want to write this essay. God, I hate this feeling. Putting somethig off sucks when you care about something related to the thing that you're putting off. Like me, I could honestly care less about this essay...or the class, for that matter...however the grades I do care about. I'm so close to a 3.5 that if I blow this, I'm throwing that away, and that was one of my goals for this school year...do well, and get a 3.5...although those are pretty much the same things.  Interestingly enough, it was the World Civ. class that led to the name of this blog. 'The Lost Generation' was the groups of artists, writers, and philosophers after World War I. They were the kids that saw no hope, they grew up with child labor, they served in the war, they came home to unemployment and then died with unbarable taxes. Nevertheless, they were creative, and still produced some of the most influental minds of our times.  You will have to excuse my spelling, I lack in that department...and I just dont care.  Anyways, the minds included Hemmingway, EE Cummings, Wolfe, Steinback, and my favorite, Fitzgerald. Thats not half of them, those are simply the ones I chose to include in my half assed essay. Almost done.
