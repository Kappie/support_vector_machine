Life is fun. :) Oh, then nojh *pronounced nodge, actually john* has gone all excited about playing rounders with a big stick... my conclusion? Obviously the laughing gas has become a part of the atmosphere! Ahh, and that's good! I hate becoming too stiff and serious, that's gotta be bad! Oh, did I tell you about all the stupid things we've been doing? It's been getting worse recently! Teehee, must be teenage rebellion against all the boring adults. We were actually having fun in PE the other day! I stepped into the long jump and got a 1m30, and Izzy cartwheeled into it! Ha! Dig our crappy rebellion against PE! YOU CAN'T FORCE US TO DO ANY THING! that we don't want to do. Eat a whole chocolate cake... definatly a yes! Ehe... see kiddy mood! Lately I've been too old mood, but I'm getting into stroppy teenager mode! YEAY!
