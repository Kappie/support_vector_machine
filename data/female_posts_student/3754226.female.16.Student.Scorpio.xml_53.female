Someone is home but that someone is lying in the dark, in the room farthest from the gate, and that someone can't hear anything. Friends, family, they call out to her from the gate (" Come out" which means "Move on") but they are unheard, unseen, unacknowledged. When someone breaks your heart, you turn into a small ball of self-pity. You lie in bed, in a ball. You hug your knees, keeping them close to your chest, like a fetus. Freud said its human instinct to go back to the womb where we can feel safe. But that's what happens when someone breaks your heart-they steal the very thing that makes you feel safe, whole, and intact.      So much for all those lines that speak about, quite of “unrequited love”, and the need to feel love and be loved… the next statements you’ll be able to read are all from the heart of a simple girl who was once captivated by the eyes of a person she mistook to be an angel… then the next morning she woke up, learned how to love, to get hurt, to stand up and be whole again.  What is the sound of my heart breaking?  It is the sound beneath the silence… deafening silence… that I want to run away just to get rid and get over not of that silence, but of the pain that keeps on maiming my heart whenever I see him smile and the reason is not me.  The sound of the angst I feel for myself, the sound of the voices inside me murmuring, “Why can’t I be like her? If she was me, will he ignore her like he does to me? If I were her, will he love me like he does to her?” I wonder… I wander in the midst of that dark sky in a sunny afternoon.  It is the sound of the million “Ouch! Aray! Awww!”s that keeps on running through my deepest veins. The sound of the breeze of the wind I wanted to catch and grasp in my hand, just as much as I want to hug him tight, so that I will never ever lose him… which I was never able to do in these 3 long years I have known him and is still, becoming a part of my chapter…  The sound of the love calculator I just checked out for our compatibility, only to find out we’re only 22% compatible, while they are 78%... don’t you feel the same feeling of the sound of a thousand miles I wanted to run for me to catch up with 56% more? Nakakahingal yun ah! But then I thought to myself, “Bakit hindi? Sa pag-ibig, walang nakakapagod… walang nakakahingal… walang nakakauhaw… walang nakakagutom… pag-ibig eh”.  It is the sound of a pen striking in a notepad, unstoppable, like I foresee this love of mine… how it grows at a stronger and uncountable rate each and everyday I thank God I found someone like him… who inspires me to do my best… and to be the greatest pain, the greatest joy, and greatest reason why I am writing this junk stuff. But I stopped for a while and think… if this will be forever… isn’t that too much to take? Won’t I ever break? I hope not… I guess not… why would he if he makes me complete… despite the fact the he empties the preemptied?  It is the sound of “message sending failed” in my cell phone. I want to txt him, I really want to… and I failed even though I haven’t tried. That’s more frustrating, don’t you think?  It is the sound of his laughter whenever he gets to talk to her, but a thousand echoes of the broken arrows of cherubim who try to shoot his heart and so he won’t take his eyes off me.  It is the sound of the cracks and grinds of my heart sprinkled with nuisance injected in me… I wonder if I haven’t been immune by this. It happened before, so many times before.  Why am I writing this? I don’t know either. There are so many things we think we know, but the truth is, we don’t have any idea about it. That is, when we’re in love. Lucky are those who feel the greatest thing we’ll ever know… to love and be loved in return; one-sided love, lucky too, of course! Because it’s better to have loved and lost than to never love at all… since the day I learned to breathe, I LIVE TO LOVE.     The experience of love is an inner state. When this is present, you are happy, alive and free. You feel good about yourself and good about life. As you bring the experience of love into your life, life works effortlessly and great things happen.  The opposite of love is fear and upset. When this is present, you close down inside. You lose your creativity and your ability to see clearly. You get tunnel vision and you interact in a way that almost always makes your situation worse.  Whether you live in a state of love or a state of upset depends, not on your circumstances, but on how your relate to your circumstances. A good way to see this is to look at upsets.  Upsets seem to be caused by what happens but they're not. Upsets are caused by your fighting and resisting what happens. To see this in your life, select a recent upset. Now notice what would happen if somehow you were at peace with what happened. There would be no upset.  There would be no upset because upsets aren't caused by what happened. Upsets are caused by fighting and resisting what happened. The moment you take away the fighting and resisting, the upset disappears.  To live in the experience of love, and to create a life that works, you need to stop the fighting and resisting. You do this through a process called "letting go."  Letting go is the inner action that releases the fear and upset. The moment you let go, everything seems to change. With the fear and upset gone, you see your situation very differently. You become creative and discover solutions that you could never have seen before.  To let go, you need to do the opposite of fighting and resisting. You need to let go of your demands and expectations for how life should be and make peace with the way life is.  Find what you are resisting. Then give it full permission to be there. If you have a fear of losing a relationship, be willing to lose it. If you are resisting the way someone is, give the person full permission to be that way.  Be willing for anything. Set yourself free inside. Then take whatever action you need to have your life be great.  Keep in mind that letting go is a state of mind and has nothing to do with your actions. Letting go is the process that removes the fear and upset so you can see what action you need to take.  In your heart, you can be willing to lose someone, but in your actions, do everything you can to make sure the person feels so loved that he or she would never want to leave.  To make letting go a little easier, there are several steps you can take. The first is trusting. Trust that no matter what happens, you will be okay. When you know that you will be okay, letting go becomes relatively easy.  Trusting is also telling the truth. You really will be okay no matter what happens. Life is only threatening when you resist. So stop resisting and trust. Trust that no matter what happens, you will be okay.  The second step in the process of letting go is to be willing to feel your hurt. Be willing to feel all the hurt and the feelings of being not okay that your circumstances reactivate. Be willing to feel the hurt of being worthless or not good enough.  The avoidance of this hurt is what makes you resist. Once you are willing to feel this hurt, the need to resist disappears. You can then let go.  For example, Robert had a fear of losing his wife Jan. To make sure she didn't leave, he hung on to her. His hanging on then pushed her further and further away. Robert was afraid of losing Jan because if she left him, this would reactivate all his hurt of feeling not worth loving. To avoid this hurt. He hung on.  Once he was willing to feel his hurt, the loss of Jan ceased to be a treat. He no longer needed to hang on and became willing for her to leave. The moment this happened he changed the way he related to her. Instead of needing Jan, he started treasuring her. Jan then felt so loved and able to be herself, she didn't want to leave.  This is what happens in life. The more you are able to let go and flow with life, the more life takes care of itself. You may not always get what you want, but you can always be free inside. You can restore both your peace of mind and your effectiveness. You can create a life that works.
