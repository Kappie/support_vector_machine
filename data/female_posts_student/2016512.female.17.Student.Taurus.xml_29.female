You know, "left for love, right for spite."    My brother is extremely talkative when I don't want him to be.  I'm having a convo on MSN and I'm writing something in this here blog... I'm not particuarly interested in how you gave one of your friends a titty twister in gym class.  *shakes head*  I'm not going to be around for the last hour of my last real day of high school.  We have a softball game in the Town of Bags, so we'll be getting out of class around 1:45.  I'm bummed.  I can't count down the last seconds of 7th hour Chemistry while the rest of the juniors in the class glare at me feverishly b/c they still have a whole week left.  *snickers* Maybe it'll rain that day... ha, the weather is never so convienient.    Speaking of weather, *sticks hands in furnace*  I had a game today, against da' Rams.  HOLY-O-FRIGHT, I've never played in colder weather!  Granted, it was only a 5-inning game b/c they ten runned us, it was still super super cold.  Way too cold to play in, way too cold.  Our shortstop threw so hard that my fingers lost all feeling in my left hand... I think they might be a little swollen.  That's not good.  Especially not for the band concert tonite.  *tear* Last band concert ever!  Is it a good thing, or a bad thing?  I don't know if I'll do the band thang at Morris or not.  I know I can't be in the band b/c I don't have room for in my schedule... so I suppose this is my last band concert.  *for real tear*  Don't cry for me Euclid, Manda
