Quite spectacular, I must say. Anyway, This is Stephanie Ip (who else?) and this blog is radtastical.  I have studied nothing all weekend, and considering exams are in a week and a half, I'm pretty much... screwed. Never fear. Steph works best under extreme pressure!  Apparently, there's going to be a guest appearance by the former bassist of the RPCYouth worship band... one by the name of... Alan MacGregor? But that's just the word on the street. Don't hold me to it.
