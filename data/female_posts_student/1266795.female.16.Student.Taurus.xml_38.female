Because I can erase everything with it!! hahaha!! I love destroying!! (But I regreted when I erased my report file accidentally)   My least favorite key is insert key. Firstly, I don't like the word 'insert'(insult), and secondly, insert key is very annoying. You know why.    And, and, My favorite disney movie is...(I don't like disney movies)...uh...Beauty and the Beast? That's the only one movie made by disney I watched. I'm not sure I got your question right Ashley.   So far, I like Miyajaki Hayao's animation.    I'm following Jane's advice for not watching Labrynth. Instead, I ask my brother to get Matrix3    Hey, it's really good to see you again, Alison, Olivia!   Olivia, did I tell you? One of my new best friend in Korea reminds me of you. Her voice, way of talking, and many other things. And her English name is Olivia!! I was very amazed!   I want to see Ali's picture. I already saw photos of Sarah, Jane, Olivia, and Ashely.        My class will be dancing in HIpHop style on May 22nd. We're practicing for 5~6 hours a day. I'm totally exhausted. We have no weekend these days. Ahhhh. Festival is killing me..!    Bye.    P.S : Do you learn Latin? I read Einstein got F in Latin, but the book didn't explain what 'Latin' is.
