This morning, Sarah and I awoke at 7:30 so we could go take pictures for the yearbook. It was really fun. I was skeptical about wanting to do it but I think I'm pretty sure that I do. The camera we are using is awesome, it probably cost somewhere around $1,300, maybe more, I don't know. After taking the pictures, we came home, made the best pancakes ever, with chocolate chips and blueberries, and watched 'Dawson's Creek', that Dawson, I gotta hand it to him, he is dealt some pretty messy situations, but does he get down, ohh...no sir, he handles them with the upmost maturity lol. I found this great song, the title is the subject and it's by a band called *COUNT THE STARS* You should download it and listen to it over and over until you can't stand it anymore. Here are the lyrics:     This air is contagious No one can save us, nothing this good could ever last And tonight is a drug, that I won't give up This is my favorite addiction The summer comes to a close,and no one knows what we know No one knows  I can't explain, what made me stay I fall into the same mistakes Like all good things They never last The past is past  I'd rather be drowning, than swimming away That's something that will never change I swallow regret, and hope for the best If this is all that i can do  This is why I never try, to make it seem we shouldn't leave This is why I never try  This air is contagious, no one can save us, but I wait  I must confess, I'm not impressed There's nothing worse than losing you I must confess, I'm not the same like all good things
