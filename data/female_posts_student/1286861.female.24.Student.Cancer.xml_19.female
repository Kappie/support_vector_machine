Let�s catch up, shall we? Where to start, where to start�  �Machinal� ended last weekend and I have very mixed emotions on the subject. It was a great, fun, learning, expanding experience. But it left me so tired. It wouldn�t have been the show it was without Kelly Williams, our director. She totally kicked ass and, as directors go, she totally let us kick ass. The opportunity to play multiple roles in an expressionist show, a theatre style that the valley was unfamiliar with, truly tested me and helped me grow as an actor. I feel I am better for it, and I will not forget the experience.  Rehearsals have already begun for �Jesus Christ Superstar�. At the rehearsal tonight we will be starting �The Firm�. It is a video exercise series incorporating weights and steps. Let me tell you how excited I am. I�m not. But it will be good to move and workout again. I haven�t done anything of the sort since the accident, I will let you know how it goes. I am very excited about the aspects of the show; the set (a 40 degree rake encompassing the whole stage), the costumes (ala �The Matrix�), the addition of video into the theatre setting (more to come on this later), and the cast (people I have worked with in the past and others I have not).  I went on an interview yesterday with  urlLink United Rental . I applied for a counter/customer service position; full time, good pay, and benefits will be included. I think it went rather well. I have to take a test and fax it into them, and following that I will be given a call next week. Cross your fingers! And if you don�t cross them for that, cross your fingers for an interview I will be taking next week at  urlLink Edwards AF Base . I am still not quite sure what the position is, but it pays A LOT of money.  Let�s see�what else? Oh yes, now I remember. Robbie :) He will be coming up to visit again from Rancho Palos Verdes on Saturday. I am really really excited. I think I am going to make dinner and we are going to watch a video here at my place. I talked to him on the phone last night and he told me he is bringing a surprise. He wouldn�t tell me what it is, and the only hint I could get out of him was that it was �gold� in color. So now I am lost and I am determined to not think about it, otherwise it will drive me crazy. I think I may like him, and more surprisingly, I think he may like me. We will see what happens this weekend :)  I think that is it for now. I will try and keep this more up to date. Oh, before I go, I want to congratulate my buddy  urlLink Chris  on his  urlLink 'news' . Way to go Chris! Keep us up to date on your status at the paper!   Till then, bon jour mon amie!
