Hahahahax. Coz i cannot miss the lessons you know. But surprisingly, Xiao Tian Tian never say "Miss Tay is sleeping at the back" hahahax. Never write for a few hundred years liao. Haha. Things have changed. Recess time have changed. So now, the only chance i can see him was in the morning, when he walked to flag rising ceremony. But the chances are slim. Sometimes don't even get to see him leh. Then after school, if got fate perhaps can get to see him bah. But again, chances are slim.  Why why why. Why must they change sec 3Es recess time. Why can't they change the 3Ns and 3Ts instead. Like that i can get to see him more. Jess can see her lao shu wah. Aiyo.. that Xiao tian tian arh. That Aineeeeee haizz...
