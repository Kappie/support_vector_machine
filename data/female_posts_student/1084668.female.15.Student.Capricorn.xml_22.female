My parents tink tt im a cruel n untroubled person hu ish heartless..  BUT IM NOT !!  why do i not dare rto show my feelings ? i dont know how . I just cant. i dunoe why.  I feel terrible . Sometimes i dont even noe wad to write in my diary. going to a counsellor isnt anything better.  i do not want to escape reality , but, i cant face it too .  i reali dont noe myself. all i noe is tt im not happy. im a sad person .  does anyone noe te tears ive cried evrynite ?  do my parents noe how much i love dem  ? do dey noe te troubles i face ?  do dey noe dat im totally opposite frm wad dey judge me frm ... do dey noe tt i dont even haf tt little amount of cruelty in me to even kill an ant..?  i dunoe y cant i present myself carefully . itz probably cos im scared .  afraid to expose myself to evryone n let evry1 noe te real me . ttz probably y im owaes jokin.  sometimez even when im not, i pretend i do .  i dont lie. but sometimes, i conceal the truth too . but, i never do n i never will lie .    evry1 tinkz tt evryting of me is a joke . but itz not . evryting of me is merely concealed well .
