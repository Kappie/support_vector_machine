So last night I had another dream about band. It was close to the one I had the other night. I had once again returned to marching band. We were in Hardin's Gymnasium, and it was weird because somehow we  all  fit in there. Nice. I was in the woodwind section, and once again I sucked at marching. I was so freakin' lost and didn't know where to march or what to do. It was weird, because somehow I  knew  I had missed three days of practice, and that's freaky because on the other dream I knew that I had missed  two  days of practice. Ugh, so weird. But like last time, someone came to pick me up right in the middle of practice: my brother. He just said we had to leave so we did. _ _;; I kept wondering and saying to myself, "Ugh, just what the heck does this mean?!" Who knew the answer would come to me today at 7 PM?  I was gonna go with Regi-chan and Gaby-chan to watch the band practice, but Gaby couldn't come for some reason which I did not understand. So at 6 PM I went to the Panther stadium to watch my friends march. I was kind of scared because I was afraid that Mr. Williams would talk to me and ask me why I had quit. I was also scared that they would convince my back into the band...but the unexpected happened.  About 20 minutes of my arrival, Mr. Williams came up and talked to me. He told me all this sort of stuff... I'm gonna try and remember what he told me. Erm...well he said that he was surprised when he had heard that I had quit. He told me that I was "band material," and that he didn't want me to miss out on such a great marching band program. Mr. W also said that I was one of the few freshmen (supposedly?) that had gotten a spot on the show. I. Had. Gotten. A. Spot. dany the dot...a spot?! *shock shock* I didn't want to say anything.  So we talked some more about the chances of me going back to band. "I mean, just think about it. If you ever change your mind, then just send me an e-mail. I'm always available. I'm hoping to get a response from you by the end of this week...hopefully." As if I hadn't given enough thought to this situation! I became unsure... again . Why?! I had made my choice, my strong and definate choice... And now Mr. Williams was about to change it?! I love my life.  Indecisive...again. Why...why...why... I didn't know what to think. When Mr. Williams was talking to me, I started to actually like band again. No biggie, it's just Mr. Williams, right?  Wrong.  A few minutes later, Ms. Fedynich comes up, "Hey, what's up with you, girl? Why?" And I told her that I just didn't like band any more. Oh I was so fuggin' nervous! I didn't know what to say... Ms. Fedynich told me almost the same things as Mr. W had told me: that she was surprised when she heard that I had quit and that I couldn't miss out on the show blah blah blah... Why...me...? ;_; I don't know what to think or what to do any more... I just...wish I could be dead right now.  So I started to think about what they had told me... I was still 85% sure that I was staying out of band. They were destroying my decision bits by bits...one by one...director by director... I feel so trapped. I just wish I could talk to someone about how I really feel, but I just can't find the words to express myself. I think my head's about to explode...  When I had arrived, I was sitting down in the Visitors side. When the band took a break, I went to the Home side. I was just sitting there...watching the people march...on all the stuff I had missed. Did I really want to go back? Why wasn't I just sure of myself? What the heck is fuggin' wrong with me?! Lovely. So I just sat there...thinking...watching...not wanting to think or watch. Thank goddess, because not long after that, Regi-chan came. w00tness! Maybe she'll make all of these thoughts to go away and cheer me up...hopefully.  Wrong again.  Once she gets there, I see Ms. Shultz coming towards me. I thought she was going to talk to Regina or something, but heck was I wrong. She said, "Daniela, come here. I need to talk to you for a minute." Crap.  "Uh...do I need to come down there?" "Yeah, just meet me by the stairs and we'll take a walk." Crap again.  --Summary of the conversation--  "*surprised voice* So what's up with you, girl? Why did you quit?"   "Uh...well it's just that I don't know... I didn't like to march any more..."   "Well, you do know that you had a spot in the show, right? You looked so good out there, and that's why the band directors chose you."   "Um well I didn't know that...they just told me that today. Eh, well I mean I  do  like playing the flute, and I like concert bands, but it's just that I  don't  like marching bands."   "Ok lemme tell you something... Summer camp... erm, sucks. I mean, no one likes to stand in the sun getting all sweaty and stuff. But the good thing is that you've already gone through that. Today's the last day of marching camp, and for the rest of the year you're not gonna practice marching for this long..."   "...*nods*"   "I mean, I was so shocked when I found out you quit. Mr. [insert dark dude's name here] came up to me and said, 'Uh well some flute girl just quit.' I was surprised and asked him, 'Well, who was it?' And he said, 'I don't know. Some short girl.' 'Well, you've gotta be more specific than that.' And I started naming all these flute players, but he didn't tell me who. Then I found out that it was you and I'm like, 'Oh no, not her. It can't be her.'"   "Heh, yeah. Mr. Williams and Ms. Fedynich have said the same thing and--"   "Oh so we've all had a grab of you, huh? See, we've talked to you because you're one of the good players out there and we value you. You're a good marcher, so don't quit just because you don't like to march. If you like to play the flute, then stay, and trust me, after today, it will get a lot easier."   "Ok, so let's say that I decide to come back. How will I be able to catch up on all the stuff that the woodwinds have done?"   "Oh I'm sure you'll be able to catch up. All the woodwinds are doing is just 16 steps back, forward, back, forward etc."   "Erm, well I'll talk to my parents about this tonight for sure... I'll e-mail one of the band directors on my final choice..."   "That's great. I mean, I'm still trying to find a replacement for you. Crazy, huh? If you had your flute with you right now, I'd put you right back in. Just think about it, ok? We don't wanna lose a great player like you."  That isn't great. That just means more unsure and more worried.  What to think...what to do...what to think...what to do?!?! I was getting so desperate because I, for a second, had no control over my life whatsoever. Three band directors had talked to me, and all of them were shocked that I had quit. You just have no idea how awesome it felt to have  three , not one, band directors tell you to come back to the band. It felt so beautiful... Now I had only one thing to do: to let them down and go my own way, or go back to my "roots" and make them...happy, I guess.  I didn't want to think of this. Enough worries for just thirty minutes, ok? Regi and I had an  awesome  time. I just couldn't stop laughing...that girl is just hilarious! I had missed her, actually, and I was happy to see her once again. She just kept saying the most stupid, yet funny, stuff I've ever heard. Oh man, it would have been a whole different day if she hadn't been there. It sucked that Gaby-chan couldn't come... ;_;  Regi-chan gave me a note and a bracelet...a fuggin' spiffy bracelet. I'm wearing it right now, actually. ;D So thanx again for the bracelet, Regi! =D *hugs granny* Talking to her made me forget about what Mr. W, Ms. S and Ms. F had said. And I'm glad, too. I didn't want to think about it this moment. Though, as we were talking, Ms. Shults told me to go and move closer to where I could see the woodwinds. I guess she does want me back...doesn't she?  So Regi and I kept talking...and laughing...and, of course, having a good time. I'm telling you, this girl is t3h r0x0rs. At 8.30 I called my mom to come pick me up. As Regi-chan and I were heading towards the front of the high school, we find Ms. Fedynich. Regi was trying to hide from her, but failed miserably.  Me: Hi, Ms. Fedynich! Ms. F: Hey, guys... Regi: *mumbles something* Ms. F: Why are you trying to hide for me? Regi: *mumbles* No I wasn't... Me: *laughs* She's just afraid that you're gonna ask her if she practiced over the summer or not. Ms. F: Oh well you don't have to hide from me. I already talked to your teacher and he said-- Me: *leaves because her ride is here*  When I got home, I talked to my parents. Just when I thought I could  finally  practice the guitar and get my lessons, everything falls over. Why?! Can someone explain to me why?!?!?!  I hate my life.  I don't want other people to control it, I want to make my  own  deicisions. I'm almost never insecure of myself, but now this... Why the he**?!?!  My mom gave me an advice again. If only anyone could know my true feelings right now... _ _;; Ugh, I just wanted to have my guitar lessons! But now that this has come up, I can't. All of my plans ruined. I'm 85% sure that I want to go back to band... Ms. Shultz just made me look at it in a whole different way. Three band directors asked me to come back... Was I gonna...?  Once I had talked to my mom, I was now 93.7% (gotta get the Math going ;D) sure that I wanted to come back. Some things had me worried:  1) How will I be able to catch up on all the marching stuff I have missed? 2) Will Ms. Callaway have a spot for me open for lessons? 3) Will Mr. Shine and/or Mr. Marrel accept me back? 4) Will I have to pass off all the stuff I had done again to get my uniform? 5) Why am I so fuggin' worried and asking so many freakin' questions?  Wouldn't you just  love  to be in my shoes right now?  I decided I was going to e-mail Mr. Williams and tell him I wanted to come back, and ask Ms. Callaway if she could squeeze me in her lessons schedule...tomorrow. But suddenly, I get this e-mail:  From: Michael T To: dany the dot   DANIELA!!! I QUIT BAND!!! YAY!!! I'M FREE!!! WHOO-HOO!!! ::dances around like an idiot:: YAY!!!! ahhh, now...freedom...i am reborn again! from the ashes...of the Duncanville Band Program arise the newly ascended Michael [insert last name here]...future star game programmer!!!!
