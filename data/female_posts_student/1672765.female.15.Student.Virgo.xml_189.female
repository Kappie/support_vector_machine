Meaning I don't have to take exams and my teachers are saying staying home if you don't have to come because they have nothing for us that aren't taking the exams. So I did and am. But I'm going in Friday because I have to turn in my Latin textbook and also I'm going to Farmville with Tara after school and then we're going to go see a movie.  I'm nervous but happy. I don't usually do anything with anybody so this is way out of my norm and that makes me nervous. I'm not so great around other people. I get awkward and don't know what to do or say.  I hope we have a good time though.   Gah. I need to trim my nails. I let them get to long. I hate them long but they grow so fast.     Music: Sick of Modern Art - The Explosion
