I was told by my doctor that they would come off before my senior year, and since I'm gone all summer I assumed the 25th is when they were going to come off.  NO.  NOW WHY WOULD MY LIFE BE THAT SIMPLE?  GO THE WAY I WANT IT TO?  Yeah, November 22nd.  That's the day they get taken off.  For sure this time because she wrote final on my little chart thingy.  This is fucking bullshit.  They were supposed to come off before my senior year so I could take my senior pictures then and have that picture in the yearbook.  But no, I have to have my crap ass school picture as my yearbook picture.  Great.  That's just great.  So while everyone around me looks great, I get to look like shit.  That's just perfect.  BRING IT ON WORLD!  IT CAN OBVIOUSLY GET WORSE THAN THIS!!  Molly told me her therapist said she has to look at this quote everyday, "The only way from rock bottom is up."  I don't find that true.  There's a deeper level than rock bottom, it's called hell.  And I'm breaking through that rock bottom.  I've made a crack too cuz I almost commited suicide.  Yup, me.  The one who said I look down on those ppl, that I have no sympathy for them.  I'm a hypercrate ain't I?  I'm admitting it right now, I almost did it.  The scissors were right there in my hand.  I don't know what to do anymore.  When will my life end?  I wish it was now, then I wouldn't have to worry about anything anymore.  It'd be really nice. later dayz
