BECAUSE NONE OF US ARE REALLY FREAKIN' PEPPY! I know I'm sure not! Conrad, you're an idiot, Bill needs to die.  This is GREAT! The last few posts have REALLY said it.  The darkness flooding over the past few days, I love it! I enjoy that kind of thing, when we all realize how things really are! How we all really are! I am demented, insane, an addict, and I hide in corners! That's the world, fear, hatred, deep depression. The General's got it there, with Mr. Poe, everybody knows, that the best poetry is written, when you're horribly depressed...or I guess if you marry your 15-year-old cousin...but whatever.  Tears stream down our enmaksed faces, to show off the best of things, while we tear and burn within, with what we try to deny or forget! But it's always here, there whispering to you from the back of your mind! Haunting you at night just when you're about to sleep, in the darkness, to soak your sadness, and bring you out from the joyus fantasy world you created! Learn to LIVE IN IT, FEED from it! We all need to accept it and grow strong from what tries to get us weak, b/c we survive on "negativity" anyway.  Stop the yelling. I'm Deadinside, and now, another uncredited quote, 'cept this is a very funny comedian's bit. Enjoy...  "...You know recently, I found out something, and it's absolutely true, I just found out but uh...when Coca-cola first came out, it actually contained cocaine...as an ingredient.  Yeah it's true, but then, so did..cocaine sandwiches....seriously, but just for like, the first few weeks, then took it out. Yeah, people were going crazy in the deli's. But no, can you imagine? What it must've been like? People must've said stuff like :: pretends to hold up Coca-Cola bottle:: 'Have you TRIED this stuf?!?!? I LOVE IT!....I've been drinking it for FOUR DAYS IN A ROW! I tarred my roof! My wife left me...I'm alphabetizing EVERYTHING!....Pepsi SUCKS...Pepsi's for LOSERS....all those Pepsi people with their "JOBS"...'"
