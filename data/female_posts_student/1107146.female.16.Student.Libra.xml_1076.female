Too bad about Riley not calling...I'm serious, because that either means that hopefully, he forgot, or more likely, that he'll call tonight when they're home.  Just make sure you answer EVERY incoming phone call.  Josh, no one is e-mailing Michael.  They're just kidding.  I'll see yall tonight. Over and out.
