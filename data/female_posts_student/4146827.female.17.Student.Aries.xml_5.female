Well, got a double K.O. The Xuanming Shen Zhang too powerful... Really hit me twice as hard... Should be K.O. to the power of 3... I did my test badly today... Trying to concentrate, yet I could not do it... Find it too tough... Thinking about yesterday... May seem to get over it... Yet the hit was too powerful... Putting up a brave front infront of everyone... Yet, still deeply hurt by yesterday... How should I say... I still miss "him"...  The truth is, experience really cannot count... I have been through lots of time, but this time, really hurt badly... I really want to save it... Yet, it cannot be done... And yet, I don't know why...  Maybe fate has really want us to be this way... It is almost one year... Yet I ultimately spoil it... What a wonderful me... And because of this, I disappointed everyone... Including the ones closest to me...  My bro just feel that I am not myself... Yet he still gave me encouragement to pull through... However, he feel that I did a choice that is hurtful to both side... Hai~!!! A cause of all problem... I HATE MYSELF... And I knew it by heart... Just too hurtful... Hai~!!!!
