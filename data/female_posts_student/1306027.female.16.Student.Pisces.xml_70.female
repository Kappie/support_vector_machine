The Update:  I have done alot of stuff in the past week and as my good friend arturo informed me, I completely forgot to thank the 5 ppl out of the 20 I know that said happy birthday on my actual birthday. Here is that list. To you people- I love ya'll beyond words.   Party Arty, thanks for the date-in-a-box. We had a lovely time on the banana boat. ;-D  Lorraine, thanks for the bday email. It was very thoughtful of you.  Tim, thanks for the emoticon party.... hehe.   David, thanks for the happy birthday. Sorry to hear about your 15th... that must have sucked.  Ellen, thanks for everything!  Everyone else said it late or didn't say it at all.... which made me so depressed that my mom stayed home from work that day. Thanks for making my 16th suck! But Im over it.    The only other big news I have  I got a hamster! And then it died 3 days later! Isn't that great? I was really starting to get attached to the little guy too.  It was a golden teddy bear hamster and his name was orsinio. I found him stone cold dead in his cage this morning. Im not sure how he died. But I think it had something to do with the bedding I bought. He had it all scrunched up around him and he prolly couldn't breathe. Poor little guy. Well he's in hamster heaven now- as well as being buried in the back yard. My dad felt bad so he bought me another hamster this evening. It's a golden short haired hamster and her name is Midas. Hopefully she will live a bit longer. I don't doubt that she will though- she about shredding the take home box.... and she seems to be pretty active.     So Long, Farewell, Alvetazane(sp?), Goodbye!
