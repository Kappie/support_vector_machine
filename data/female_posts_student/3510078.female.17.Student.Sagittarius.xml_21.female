[ rain drinker. ]  	 I'd been hearing rain for hours by then and it had became background music to my own breathing; there were no cymbals or drums in my private symphony, just the sweet imbalance of instruments unnamed. Cocooned but surely not expecting anything beautiful or winged to emerge from the sheets, I'd awaken to the ceiling, gray and whirling but no, that was just paint or the fan, which I had just noticed for the fiftieth time. 	Slowly, I'd risen to a sitting position, sheets still pulled to my chin though sliding from my shoulders in a reminder of why one shouldn't sleep nude or nearly so; the chill of getting up unclothed is enough to set them to pajamas and socks (them excluding me).         He sat outside my window---in the rain. And because of this I knew he must've been insane. My first reaction had been one that any person, let alone female, would think to see a man sitting outside their window in the rain (only he wasn't sitting out my window and staring at me, he was sideways, sort of, and staring into the sky). He looked wistful, intelligent, and barely tangible in a world of permanently opened Starbucks and chewed up Bic pens (yet there he was).         I don't know why I wasn't worried, for all I knew he could have been a very dangerous man. But while I sat there and stared at him (as he stared at the sky), I couldn't believe he would hurt me; with his black hair slicked over his forehead and wire framed glasses silver moons above his nose, why would he do anything but be?        His hand came up and he drank from a water bottle, and for some reason the action made me smile; this man in the rain outside my window, drinking from a blue water bottle, made me smile. I slipped one bare foot to the floor, skin soft and warm against cold, hard floor but it was perfect somehow, that contrast.           I was already whispering my words as I walked to the window, who are you? I reached the sill and lifted the glass easily, not leaning out but waiting for him to notice me. He did but barely turned his head and eyes in acknowledgement. I said what I had to and he shrugged.         I am White shadow, Silver night and, Red sky; I am. I don't know how long I stared at him after that, but I know he drank three times, and his throat moved four times with exception of the third time, in which he swallowed thrice, with one long, last draw.        You are a lot. I think I was mocking him, and I know he didn't mind. I knew him, he knew me and we'd actually been talking for months; we always said the exact same things as if each meeting was the first.   The second time he came, I had to have his name because during first incident we'd sat in silence on a clear morning. He gave them and a smile.         This time, in the rain, he'd stood and leaned into the window, dripping along the sill and floor as his lips pressed to mine. And I'd thought to myself that maybe the sky had cried for him. I had dispelled that thought as his hand had touched my cheek, wet and warm; the heavens had been broken and an angel couldn't fix it because he had fallen and sat in the rain outside my window. I supposed God could get mad later, and I could content for that one moment.
