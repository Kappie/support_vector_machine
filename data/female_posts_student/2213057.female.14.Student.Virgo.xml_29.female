Be happy when other are not. Spread the love when others are down and give hugs all around. You have not loved until you have lost. You have not eaten until you have been hungry. Hallow souls unite, I have a piece to write tonight.  Love, slow, sweet, soft and true. Abide and happiness will come to you. Hurried kisses, love affair, pain and worry, we are not aware. Pure, clean and delicate, your heart is yours to commit. Tears spilled, minds filled, with an angry thing the lie may bring. Despair, has an air of one who does not care. Would it care to share why love isn't fucking fair? Love many times, my friends, and discover the soul that connects with yours, forever more. But what do I know? I'm only 14.
