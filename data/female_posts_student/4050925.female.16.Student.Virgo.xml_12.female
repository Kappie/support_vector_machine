"shithole"performance>>$12   2. LEP farewell for year 2>>$6   3.CCS farewell for year 2>>$2   4.CCS gathering at marina bay>>$12   Total>>$32    the reason why pple go in cliques is bcos they feel comfortable with those pple they hang out with. and if pple are not interested in joining others, no matter wad others do, pple wun change. pple are who they are and when u're friends with them, u learn to accept them for who they are and not change them. if changes are required that it shows tt the person is not suitable to be wif u. it is v simple. i'll give a analogy>>>if a guy likes a girl and he expects her to change this n that for him then he's actually loving another person of tt character. in that case u might as well look for someone with the character traits he desire. no point trying or forcing someone to change becos of u. and a person in the correct state of mind will not do that.   i'm getting of damn bloody freaking sick of CCS. it is totally different from wad i expected it to   be. a   BIG    disappointment!and pple in there esp teachers are v difficuilt to get along with. it's just the practical world. one word to describe my feelings now>>  SICK   !      went to hand in the house com thingy today, hope i can get in then i'll leave CCS for good. pls pray for me n wish me luck cos i need them badly. i miss the times i talk n complain to loi,pam n lynette over the phone. cos i'm just too busy for the phone nowadays. and besides them i dun think anyone else understand how i am feeling right now. i am in the state of going berserk!   can't think of anything tt can help me relieve stress except venting out my frustrations on this keyborad...tt's why i am typing so roughly!!!
