It just hurts so damn bad, and I don't think anyone begins to realize that everytime I hear her name, my insides just ache thinking of the two years of my life where I could safely classify her as my best friend, and she just drops me at the beat of a drum when I'm "upset." Nice. Really really nice.   Went to see Spiderman 2 with Jessie tonight. Sarah was and probably will continue to be angry with me for being what she would like to define as "two-faced." I would like to call the same characteristic  not judgemental of others for rumors, or mistakes they have made that are not so easily forgotten. People are more than they act to be. They have insides, they have feelings, and just because they are not friends with my sister does not mean I am going to shrug of their politeness to me as if it means nothing.   Talked to Marie on four separate occasions today. First time she was livid, second irate, third satisfied because John called, and fourth tired and ready to go to bed. She's like a gerbil in one of those little running wheels...keeps going around and around, eventually too tired to carry on, but goes through the same routine the next day like it's her first time. Only Marie. ;-)
