I think it's really mean, I always go and talk to people who are alone, why can't more people be like me? (AARGH!) Hey! I'm nice... some times... *evil grin* Hmm, but seriously, how can you all gang up on some one I would feel really bad if I did that. So pants to the people who are being mean to Lynne! Yeay! Hmm, but seriously (seriously? you???) Yeah, ignore the spelling, but any way... seriously we're here for you Lynne! (Technically I'm half here because some times my brain goes for walkies) Hmm, life is confusing isn't it? If it wasn't so confusing it wouldn't be fun! Just think about it... Maybe it's true! Well yeah... hmm now I'm thinking about it! (fell into your own trap) trap?!
