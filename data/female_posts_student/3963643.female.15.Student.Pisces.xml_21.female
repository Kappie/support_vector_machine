Can you trust the wind rush? Can you let it all go? Leap over the part of you that stands and waits You can never be too late.  Forget about those reasons,  (just go out and try)  forget about the rules,  (Let go and  fly )      Every moment , a hope of change Feel a cool breeze dance down my spine. For a second, the world can wait Let go and  fly .   Every moment   (calling)  Feel a cool breeze  (dance in my soul)  The second the world  (feels a rush)  Just let go, let go  (and  fly )
