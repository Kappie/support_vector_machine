I was sitting here, looking at my costume, longing for another chance to get all dressed up and go out to the Rocky Horror Picture Show when it dawned on me. It's Friday! Now I nearly fell off my chair with excitement (Wow, I fall off my chair too much) and antici.....pation for this great event. Yes. I have something to live for again.
