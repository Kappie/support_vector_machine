I'm Marianna Worthy, a 22 year old student at University College Northampton. I'm studying BA Electronic Business, and I must admit that I hadn't really heard of "Blogs" until my course introduced me to them.  I have lived in Northampton for nearly all my life (ok, so I lived in Birmingham for a bit...) and now that I'm staying here for the next few years, until I finish my course at UCN, I thought I'd try to get some discussion about the town. There are always issues in the news that affect Northmapton, and this will give me the chance to ramble on about them, maybe even offer up solutions to some of the problems. I also look forward to the insight offered by other residents of Northampton, and also from people from all over the world. Maybe someone else knows the solution to Northampton's problems!!? I also look forward to adding photographs to this Blog, of Northampton as I see it today. Maybe other people will be inspired to take photographs and submit them to me for addition to the Blog. The point is that I want this Blog to represent all the issues that Northampton has, all the good and all the bad points about Northampton, all the successes and all the failures. I want the best for Northampton while I'm living here, and I hope others do too.
