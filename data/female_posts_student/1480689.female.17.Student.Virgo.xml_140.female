I just got home from work and in about 2 hours, I’m going to go pick Mike up. Oh, I never do anything wrong. I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, and I won’t even think about touching drugs. And sex is most definitely out of the question. However, I need alone time to talk to him. And it’ll be fun. We’re exchanging presents…I wonder what he got me? I put thought into his presents. I ordered a t-shirt of his favorite band and a book about this web comic he reads. Also, I bought Adidas cologne and the Blood Brothers CD, “Burn Piano, Island Burn!” He would still have it, but when my CD case was stolen, that CD of his was in it… oops. But I’m going to go pick him up now.  Day 3. December 21st, 2003. 8:00 a.m.  	Oh, man last night was a blast!!  my Christmas presents rocked. Three pairs of cute socks, 2 pairs of undies, a candle, perfume, and a scarf!!! Oh, the scarf is so soft. He put a lot of thought into my presents, and I love him for it. The perfume is something I talked about a month or so ago, and he remembered it! I guess that I find that to be very endearing that he actually remembered something about me, but that’s the norm for him. Most of the other guys that I dated, were a lot less considerate of my feelings. Mike, is wonderful he’s sweet and kind, and I never feel like an inconvenience to him.   Day 4. December 26th, 2003.  today, is a stress day. I have tears in my eyes as I’m typing this, excuse any type-os. my day as follows:  wake up at 10:24 just to realize I need to be at work at 11.  get in the shower wash my hair and face.  run to my bedroom in bra and undies, trying to find work pants and shirt  get dressed, throw brush blow dryer and makeup into a bag.  run into the kitchen grab food and OJ  grab the bag and jump into my car.  driving to work while eating  run into work with my hair in a dripping wet bun and into the back room I go  brush my hair and dry it enough so as to not have it dripping down my back  put on make-up so I look human  down the rest of my OJ and then brush my teeth  run up front to my assistant manager saying, "Jess, I need to vent to you."  the 2 HUGE walls weren't done  the store wasn’t vacuumed  there were CD's laying around in the isles  the light bulbs weren't changed.  that set us back about 3 hours....  Zack and mark came in...  they really didn’t know where oh.....ANY CD'S WERE!!!!!  "jess where's Hilary duff? jess where's this jess where's that" OH MAN!  everything was on my shoulders  I had to ring up every thing, mark and Zack, are flaming retards. that’s it they are. well, they're cool, but I just couldn't deal with ignorant people today.   SHOOT-ME-IN-THE-FACE  post script. I know that I skipped a few days, I’ll get back to that, I just haven’t copied it into this yet.   Day 5. December 23rd, 2003. 11:00 p.m. 	Exhaused. That’s the word that comes to mind when I sit here. I have just danced for 6 hours and worked with grumpy customers for another 5. Let us recap: dancing and yelling (not singing mind you, you can’t sing at a normal tone of voice and except to be heard while trying to dance) from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and working with jerks from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. I hate it. And, I am the only person at my store to do anything! No one else makes an effort to make the store presentable and organized, no one. On the upside, I don’t work tomorrow and I don’t have Spotlighters until January 2nd. I’m going to bed now, because sleep is great.  Day 6. December 25th, 2003. 10:55 p.m.  	 I like waiting until either a half or full hour comes around before writing, but I just want to go to bed. Ok chritsmas eve rocked. I was disappointed that I didn’t get to see Tommy, but he had the flu. I got money, and a necklace from Tiffany and Co. oh man, I love it. It’s a delicate silver chain with a “J” on it. Personally I think it looks like an abstract Jesus fish. And today we were at my Aunt’s house and I got my secret Santa present from my cousin. Socks, a CD, lotion, I liked it. I feel bad though, because Mike doesn’t really have any family to celebrate Christmas with. I knew it bothered him, he  told me that he was lonely, even sitting in a room with 20 people, when he knows they aren’t his family. I really don’t know what to say to that, because I have always had a loving supportive family. Unlike his, who have disowned him. They are all: and I apologize for the language Mr. Westenburger: assholes.  I know that he’s a strong person, but only so much can happen before someone breakdown. I just know that I am the only good thing he has right now, and I won’t let him down.  Day 7. December 27th, 2003. 8:00 p.m. 	Heh, so I spent most of the day up in Madison with Geoff. I took him to work at 5. But when I tried to drive home, I got lost. It took me an hour and a half to get home. AN HOUR AND A HALF! I ended up in Lake Mills, how the heck I did I have no idea, but I walked into a gas station and by luck, some guy how had just come from a pipe laying job in Milton was in there. So he told me how to get back, thank god. Now, I’m going to curl up with my book Lamb by Christopher Cross. It’s hilarious. It’s about the “lost years” of Jesus, fictional, and I recommend it to everyone. …Like anyone will see this. Heh. Oh well. Anyway, on to reading.  Day 8. December 29th, 2003.  We said that we could work it out And that we would still talk But now that the tides have shifted  The sun doesn’t set  It’s the same small talk every time Conversations trail off into silence That awkward silence we swore we’d never have The sun doesn’t rise  Bring back the times that made us smile Our steps cushioned with security Of each other’s company The stars keep falling  Like you fall away from me When we talk, I miss you Our conversations trail off into silence…  Hm. Something that popped into my head. I thought I would add variety to my journal, considering that  if it was my actual journal, it would have like, 9,000 poems and such.  Day 8. December 30th, 2003. 11:30 p.m. 	Mike, is the greatest. We just laid on my futon in the rec-room and talked. About, our favorite Disney movies and his traveling experiences. By traveling I mean, being forced to move every 3-9 months because his parents were in the Air Force, and he always traveled with them and lived on base. I have never been much of a traveler, nor do I want to. Most people after high school, want to take a year off and travel abroad. I don’t want to experience that. I just want to get my degrees, get a job, buy a house, and start my life as soon as possible. I know I’m going to be in college for a while, getting a degree in marketing and then in psychology, but I want to start a career as soon as possible. I want to be a successful clinical psychologist who lives in the middle-upper class. I want to be married before I’m 30 and have only one kid. I don’t really like children, but I think that view might change. I just have to start having some more tolerance to be able to have a kid running around screaming and stuff. Ah well, that’s still kind of far off…I don’t want to grow up.  Day 9. January 1st, 2004! 10:00 a.m. 	So I’m hella excited and tried all at the same time. My new year’s was ok, I got to see Mikey. We went to Carrie’s house and then to the Microtel Inn to another party, but stayed there  only 45 minutes and then went back to my house. Sat downstairs and watched the ball drop. HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! And today, after work, he’s taking me to a movie. Whee! I think that we’re going to see The Last Samurai. It looks super good, but I don’t know if I want to go see an action movie. Meh. I do want to see Mona Lisa Smile, haha, but I won’t make my boyfriend see such a chick flick. I’m way nicer than that.  But, I have to go to work. The only reason I was put on the schedule, was because they knew I wouldn’t be hung over. Stupid drinkers. I hate alcohol. Bye!  Day 10. January 2nd, 2004. 3:30 a.m. 	I don’t feel like a writer. I am not good with descriptions, and I don’t like to be lengthy. This assignment, is great, because I can write what I want. Ands if I can’t site 3 examples of why my New Year’s sucked or not, I won’t get marked down. This has given me a place to write, without judgment, I hope, and freely. I know it wasn’t a BAD journal, where I revealed all of my deepest darkest secrets, but I never will write those down.
