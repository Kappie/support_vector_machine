I don't try to dress like a hot topic person. I dress like me. So how can I pose if it's what I am? He just didn't like my Good Charlotte icon. I don't know anything about GC other than the facts 1) Cierra owns a copy of their CD, and I saw it like..in 6th grade in her room and thought it looked..interesting. 2) they sing that rich song.
