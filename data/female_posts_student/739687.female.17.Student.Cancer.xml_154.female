I've gotten a total of 7 hours of sleep in the past two days, and it's really catching up with me.  I couldn't stay awake 4th period today at all. Today's been a good day though...lots of fun.  Okay, well, I can't think of much to say. I have no energy whatsoever. And I can't think. Well, I'm off to do homework or take a nap...most likely the latter, seeing as how for some reason I just looked up the word "likely" in the dictionary. Yes, I need sleep. Buh Bye crazies.
