I really just want to get away... i want to go on a hike he something hehe... damn the bronze was good. of course i say that NOW not on saturday.  I'd LOVE to go on the silver practice. best hike ever, so pretty! i'm going to try and figure out how to put up pictures so i can stick up my fave dukes one. sigh...
