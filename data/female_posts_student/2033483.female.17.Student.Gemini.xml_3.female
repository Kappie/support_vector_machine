Tami, my sister-in-law, said that my brother, Brian, got sick off of Subway last week.  I think it is a conspiracy.  Everybody eats Subways, gets sick, looses weight as a result, and then thinks back to the last things they ate and come up with Subway and think "but whoa, that's healthy food I must have lost weight from eating right."  The Subway Diet my ass!  We live in such a vein society that one would think just eating Subway for every meal would make you lose weight.  Sorry folks, diet and exercise!  That sounded very pissy.  eh, read on!  At lunch today, I was talking about Subway and Mr. Powers just happened to be close by and heard me say "Damn Subway".  Well, needless to say he freaked out.  If you know Mr. Powers you know his thing against swearing.  But Nicki can say every word in the book and get a "Nicki don't say that" but, I say "Damn" and he acts like I committed murder or something.  He said it was because I never swear.  I wasn't about to tell him my dad told me I swore like a sailor.  But I don't agree with swearing, it is very unattractive and a sin I realize this and I try not to I do, I do.  But sometimes when you get mad it just comes out.    Right, so I came home sick and everything.  I was really tired but I knew I couldn't fall asleep b/c I had to pick my brother up from school and I knew I wouldn't wake up on my own if I fell asleep so I forced myself to stay awake.  But when I got home I did some homework and then fell asleep at around 5 and was waken up by my mom (again) at 9.  She's so worried I'm sick.  Well, I am, that's why I came home.  But she's like why are you so tired all the time?  And I gave her a really dumb answer and she's like "Kayla you're so snippy!" I'm not snippy, it's just if you ask a stupid question, you're gonna get a stupid answer!    When she woke me up it was to tell me that I had to start packing for our trip to Watertown this weekend. Fun times I know, I can't control my excitement. yay!  (completely sarcastic)  I was told to pack a nice outfit for the dinner at the Drake.  It's my grandpa's 80th birthday so everyone is in town for it.  But let me explain the Drake for those who have not had the privilege of eating there.  It's a truck stop hotel.  It's run down, has nice food, but it is far from being the Four Seasons!  Why do I need to dress up to eat at the truck stop hotel?  Also, since I fell asleep I got minimal homework done so this means I'll have to work on it up there with everyone asking what I'm doing, why I'm doing it, and why I didn't get it done sooner.  It's none of your damn business!    Mr. Powers would not approve of all the swearing in my blog.   Maybe I am sick...or just grumpy.  I don't know why tho I've had plenty of sleep!  But I think I am off for more sleep!  Goodnight!  Oh, and Renae, before I forget, the hot hy-vee guy doesn't like me.  Just because I've exchanged words with the kid doesn't mean anything.
