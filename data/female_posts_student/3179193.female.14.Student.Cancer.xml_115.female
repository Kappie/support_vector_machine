He's good looking! ^^ But you know who's even better? NIMA! Hehe!  I downloaded tons of wallpaper and the sound track. So romantic and stuff!   Talking to Chris and Alice on MSN.   Oh noo! I missed Jae's call! He called... probably to go golfing! I was out with Nima this morning so yeah. I went over to his place at 10am and we hung out in the basement. Jordan was upstairs playing on the computer. Haha... then we went outside and hung out at HeadWaters. Coolness. Tons of fun. :) Lupper! LOL!  I miss Nima... *sniff sniffzZ* I wish I could see him right now. I don't know where he is... whether he's at home or wherever... I miss him. I probably won't get to see him tomorrow... he's going to Demetri's birthday party and I might go golfing with Jae if he's not busy. *sighzZ* That means I probably won't get to see Nima until Monday.  I thought of Nima non-stop all night... I thought about high school and what would happen. I came up with something but I forgot to tell Nima. So I guess I'll tell him later if I get the chance. I just hope I won't forget. :)   은헤야... 나이상해... 이싱하게 기슴 이두근거렸어... 나... 이럼 안되는 거저...? 너한데 미한 거지...?  That was a quote from the movie. ^^ So yeah...   I gotta go for a sec... Nima if you're reading this, I LOVE YOU. :)
