I felt sick this morning after eating breakfast, but once I ate lunch I was better.  For A. Living we went off-campus and we got to go bowling which is really fun.  I am sort of upset with the English teacher right now because he was telling us that we should have finished lots of the questions that we had in these booklets that he gave us, and that he said is "assumed" most people had finished the book.  Well earth to Mr. Proux but:   I CAN'T READ MINDS!!!   He never told us what questions to do, and never even mentioned what chapter we were to read up to.  That makes me mad, but whatever.  Things are the way they are.  Finally someone talked to me about just ANYTHING!  You know, other then just normal friends.  Mrs. J is amazing and one of the people I look up to.  We had quite the interesting convo during tutorial.  She is the only person who takes interest in aspects of my life.  A lot of other people do really care, but she cares and she's really cool.
