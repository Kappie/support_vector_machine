Since the first time He gave breath to man, men have continued to try to live life to the best of their means. Life maynot always come at everyone in the same way, or with the same force. But just think; atleast you have a life that can be screwed up, compared to those who have lost their lives.   A Wise Word: Never take life for granted. Praise His name.
