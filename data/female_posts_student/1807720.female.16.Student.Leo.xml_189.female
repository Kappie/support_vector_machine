It doesn't tell me what's right or wrong, doesn't insult me, or give opinions, and it doesn't talk.  Sounds like something good to me.  Anyways, I was bored, yes bored of the comp so I went for a walk.  I actually went to the old wodden park near by and sat on a swing until I was dead bored so I went for a walk around the school and then around Evergreen and Shawnee and back home again.  Then I had some fruit - the other half of my lunch.  For lunch I only had a granola bar, but when I got back from my walk I thought that maybe not eating like anything isn't exactly the best thing.  So I had some fruit, and it was so good actually.  Better than junk food because you don't have to feel guilty eating it because it's healthy.  I had an oragne, bluberries, and a nectarine.  Yum!  I think my mom is also picking me up a side salad from Wendy's.  You know I am tired of hearing about the debate on TV.  That is all everyone always talks about now.  I mean C'mon Paul Martin really doesn't have a chance.  The only people that will vote him are all the French people that don't know any better.  All Liberals are good for is wasting money if you ask me.  I wish I were old enough to vote because Conservatives are clearly best for what Canada needs.  Stephen Harper is the best, he is like a family man and everything.  He believes in what is important for everyone.
