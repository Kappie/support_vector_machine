I went to work and Ryan and Tony came up there and they ordered a pizza.  After work I went to Ekerd to talk to Ashley and I brought her some pizza. Then I left there and changed and went to the pool hall with Ryan....I called Eka to see what time he had to be home and he said 10. So I was leaving. Only being at the pool hall for 10 min.  I wanted Ryan and Tony to come but agian me and Ryan got into it. It sucked. So I left crying. When I got home Ryan had called me and then they showed up on my door step and stayed for around 45 min. They left at 11:45....It was nice...
