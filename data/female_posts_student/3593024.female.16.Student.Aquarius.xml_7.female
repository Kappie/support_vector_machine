We went to cleburne earlier to get hair color I decided I needed to change my hair color b/c my old hair had to do with old ppl so I figure no more blonde highlights for awhile. We had so much fun b/c after we went to walmart we went to wendys and brandys boyfriend ex boyfriend who knows what he is but he works there at wendys and there was a girl that worked there and said he could do better as in another girlfriend well that girl was like a cow so we called her moo moo. That was fun. We all had so much fun I mean I havent had so much fun in one day in so long. I am just sitting here waiting for the hair color to get done i hate to wait I am not a patient person, as most ppl would know. I know I havent wrote in here in a long time but nothing interesting has happened well I mean I had fun at Padre like so much fun the beach is one of the prettiest places I have ever been. I cant wait till school starts so that way it will be over quick basketball will be extremely different this year, school will be interesting with everyone that I use to hang out with changing right in front of everyones face I would have never thought ppl would do the things they do that just goes to show you dont always know ppl like you think you do. After this year I will have one more then I graduate and leave so exciting just cant wait to go and experience new ppl and a new atmosphere. Well I just thought I should write in here since i havent in awhile.    love ya'   Jess
