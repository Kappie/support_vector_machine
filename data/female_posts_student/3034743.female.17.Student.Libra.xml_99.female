There is nothing like being in the wrong body on a dark night, let me tell ya. Never was I so    confused    in my life! In search for some   juicy peaches   , I began crawling due to my childish nature. Any onlooker would have been most   confused   due to my appearance. None of this is making sense, you say? You are right to think such a thing! None of   this makes sense   and it is all because of a   very   good reason. I am lying to you. Yep, I lied. Why did I lie? I thought I would spice things up. Spice...makes me think of the   Spice Girls  . Ginger was my favorite. I once recall hearing that ginger root is good for sea sickness.   I just can't     do it captain!   What is love? Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more. I walked across an empty room. I felt the earth beneath my feet.     You had me at hello .    Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates...ya know what? Life is like a box of chocolates, and I'm going to eat every fucking chocolate in that box!   THIS IS NUCKING FUTS!
