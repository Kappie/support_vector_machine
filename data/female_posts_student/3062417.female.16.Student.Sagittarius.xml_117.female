So today I'm not doing much of anything so I think I'm going to call Kim up later and see if she wants to go running with me. I got to get in shape for field hockey now or I'll procrastinate and be hurting really bad during pre-season. Or maybe I'll go shopping when my mom gets home. Hm...the choices. Well, I'll probally end up doing nothing so if anyone wants to do anything just call.  Tomorrow is Remsen graduation and then Gavin's and Jon's party. Then Monday is Chemistry review from 10-12 and then Math review from 1-4. Oh fun a whole day of review!  Listening to: [Just Let Me Cry by Ashlee Simpson]  I'm about to lose control  I, I don't know why Why you need some reason to feel lost inside You, you know that I'm alright  You know that I'm just the kind of girl that feels so hurt and smiles   I don't use excuses Don't ask why It's just a breakdown It happens all the time So get out of my face Don't even try Ya wanna help me, just let me cry   Yeah I loved you all my life You don't even know a thing I feel inside No, by the look in my eye That I'm just fine but I might need you to hold me tight   I don't use excuses Don't ask why It's just a breakdown It happens all the time So get out of my face Don't even try Ya wanna help me, just let me cry  I don't use excuses Don't ask why It's just a breakdown It happens all the time So get out of my face Don't even try Ya wanna help me, just let me cry  I had a bad day, I'll cry if I want to, cry if I want to, cry I had a bad day, I'll cry if I want to, cry if I want to, cry I had a bad day, I 'll cry if I want to, cry if I want to, cry I had a bad day, I'll cry if I want to, cry if I want to, cry  Just let me.... cry  Just let me cry, I'm crying, I'm breaking down......... I'm breaking down just let me cry  I don't use excuses Don't ask why It's just a breakdown It happens all the time So get out of my face Don't even try Ya wanna help me, just let me cry  I don't use excuses Don't ask why It's just a breakdown It happens all the time So get out of my face Don't even try Ya wanna help me, just let me cry
