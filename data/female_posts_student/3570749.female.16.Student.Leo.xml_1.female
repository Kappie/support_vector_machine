My mother first had me study for my SAT's and then my mom made a list of chores for me and my sister to do.  My sister is always in a bitchy mood and it irratates the crap out of me.  I can't wait until I go to Libby's house on Wednesday.  I get to get out of this house!  AND PARTY!!!  I mean act nicely and watch educational movies and tv shows.  H-E-L-L N-O!  My mother thinks that I am going to do something soooo bad if I am with Libby or Aqua.  I trust both of them and if they are doing something bad, then I will have the guts to them they are.  But I don't think that I am that stupid to do something like....have sex, drink, do drugs.   If I want to just get high then all I have to do is eat skittles and drink a A root beer.  Oh well my sister is getting more bitchy as my dad bugs her about getting a job.  Looking at colleges for me parents are excited and sister gets jealous.  At this point I can't deciced how my summer is going to be.
