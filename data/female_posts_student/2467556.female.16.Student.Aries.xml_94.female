I felt like such a terribly american while taking the social studies TAKS test because i couldn't remember very much of basic american history without tons of thought.  Math TAKS wasn't that bad, but Science TAKS was freaking hard.  OMG i didn't remember anything, i guessed on half the questions.......hello TAKS Remedial!!!!    Sports Update: San Jose failed to sweep Colorado last night, which was dissappointing.  They went through a scoreless game and then Colorado scored 5 mins into OT.  My pick for cup finals, Tampa Bay, plays tonight and i hope Vincent LeCavalier (my fave on their team right now) scores a few goals like usual!!!  Martin St. Louis is cool too, he's so short!!!  Hopefully Tampa Bay will complete their sweep over Montreal (who deserves it because Boston SO outplayed them last round but due to a stupid game 7, lost out).    In other news, on Monday, i met my buddy, Jimmy, face to face for the first time ever.  It was cool, despite the fact that he already knew what i looked like etc.  What's weird is that now that i've met him, i never see him anymore!  oh well, its cool whatever  gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
