Everyone agrees Incubus’ lead singer Brandon Boyd has an edgy, scruffy charm to him the girls really dig. He’s deep, passionate, and practically a slave to music. And you, Candy girl, are no exception. With your sharp ear for melody and genuine love for lyrics, you know your calling has always been in music. And this has affected every corner of your life: from your point of view to your fashion sense. Rock on!
