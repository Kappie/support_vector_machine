Well, I'm not sure you can say stuff  hasn't  happened, but I always get a feeling that when something big happens I'm only there to watch. I'm the  watcher ... Hey, wasn't that some movie about a psychopath?  Whatever...   ~:~   Me and some classmates went on a holiday trip to some redneck-smalltown up north... The best friend I've got in my class, Tom,used to live there until last year, so wecrashed in his mum's old appartment. It was a mess. Well, not just the appartment, but the whole holiday. First,Tom is the only one of my "mates" I really like, he's one of my best friends, but he can really piss me off! See, he's got one of the world's worst self-esteems I've ever bumped into, so he lets this total bitch (another fabulous classmate)take control over him. Nowadays it can even be hard getting a word out of him, he usually lets her do all the talking since they're constantly glued to eachother. I feel a bit sorry for him, but I don't know what to do to help him take control...   Back to the story. It was Tom, the total bitch Linda, the slightly neurotic and partly annoying Mandy, and me. There we were accompanied by Tom's only friend from that town, Robin. Must be tough living in that place for 15 years with only one friend. Well, I guess being gay did't make Tom too popular. Rednecks! If I only had the money I'd go to that pride festival...   Of course, Linda constantly did her best in trying to bully me out, but I couldn't be bothered. She's pathetic. Apart from that, the holiday started off really nice. We explored the village, Worked on that tan on the beach, and had a picnic in the park. Cozy.   Of course,after a day we wereso bored we could just die. So we did the one thing to do: Got completely shit-faced. For some reason, like always when we drink together, I get to be the sensible one. So, after talking Mandy out of trying to convince Tom to have sex with her, I became Robin's marriage counselor (does it spell like that?). Apparently he had been talking to Linda on MSN and fallen madly in love with her. What can I do? At least I talked him out of cutting off his long hair for her sake. (Ok, he would probably look better with shorter hair, butfor her sake I wouldn't lift a finger).   ~:~   By the way, in her completely drunk but always honest state, Mandy asked me how it feels to be good  all the time. Usually I don't strike myself as an unusually  good  person, but when I think it through I realise that with my classmates I'm always good, honest, caring, and would never ever say I count Linda as a bitch. There is one simple reason, and it is that I feel sorry for them.   ~:~   I felt miserable the next day. Of course, being the sensible one is often my job since I'm not very easily affected by alcohol, butit'sso not worth getting a hangover for.Besides, this wasn't the usual hangover. I was completely dead.How could I haveknown I was allergic towhiskey? Still ill, four kilos lighter,and carrying myself likeOzzy Osbourne,I packedmyself into the bus to finally get home a couple of days later. Do I have to say I won't everbe drinking whiskeyagain?   ~:~   I relaxed with a couple of days in my summer house by the sea with my family andsome real friends. I'm myself again, and itfeels good.Today I went shopping, so stuff is very much back to normal.   ~:~   I've been trying to upload a picture of myself here, but I'ts just too complicated with all those things you have to download... Or is there an easier way? If you can help me I'd be happy! For now, I'll just describe myself, it's just much easier: I'm tall, 175 cm, with blonde hair and greyish eyes... That's probably it.   Ellen called my now, we're going nightbathing... Brr!  Got to go, seeya!
