Enjoy rockin' the burbs in your tryk'd-out rizzizle.  Heya Scott, welcome back. You're right, it has been a frickin'ly long while.  I dun care if he sees it, not like there's anything too hazardous on said wonderful BLog.  Oh Abby...you've reached the dark enlightenment. Rraugh! Everytime I think about school....well, I was going to say I want to cry or be an EMO kid and kill myself, but I've come to the point where I feel like I can still do good without pressuring myself over it. So school isn't so threatening as it has been the last eleven years. But you are right, none of that stuff matters. If you really think about it, what's the immediate practicality in algebra? If you're going to apply yourself to that kind of career, sure. But it's not like you're going to use it to fill out your W2s or to go on a scavenger hunt at the company picnic with the wife and kids and have to find the mystery variable to locate "a pink frisbee" or anything like that. "Let sleeping dogs lie" as to history...it's Greco-inspired BS, I just can't see how it would be quintessential to human existence to have to know about a bunch of fumbling idiots screwing the future. And  Low Rider ...well, let's just say if you'd learned it on the banjo it would be a lot more worth it, heheh. But teachers are incredibly gay and hellbent on self-preservation..."let's keep that work coming so we can make enough to get a Happy Meal at McDonald's some day".  WOW ARE TEACHERS COOL. Like Mr. Bastard.  Mr. Adams's isn't giving a curve this year...I feel really bad for Sarah Heines and Jonathan (kid who rides my bus and a huge Stranglebox fan (w00t!), taking Euro this year). But he says he needs to weed the boys from the men. And suddenly I remember that I have to take AP tests again and my life became horrible. After all that BS about "haha skool is gay  i dun care no more". BLAH.  And as to the last posts (if anyone hasn't notice, I responded to them backwards from my last one) from Linds and Rosie...please just remember that you can only do so much before it's too much. When you feel like you've nailed it while studying or solving a problem or something then STOP THINKING ABOUT IT, that's all you can do. And remember what the seniors last year said about burn-out. At least wait til mid-terms before you do, in the very horrible event of its happening.  No joke it's hard, but it's only as hard as you make it, and you could apply that to the whole world if you needed to.  Here's lookin' at you, kids.
