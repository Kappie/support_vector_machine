"tama bng gawing sandalan ang likod ko at relax na relax pa sya?!"        the concert was alright.. though i stayed with my hyskul friends.. gusto ko rin sana makasama ang 1nu24 kaso di pwede sabay eh.. people were jumping and singing.. i was contented coz i heard them sing "love of my life" that was their opening song..        im really deppressed.. there's something heavy in my chest!! i dont know if that is because of the exhaustion inside noble gym.. i just had to get that out.. i dont have an "outlet" available right now.. but ive tried telling it to some friends.. i am just not sure if they understood me.. i think ill just focus mainly on my studies..        god, please be with me...
