We're gonna go out to eat then I think a walk on the beach or chill and watch a movie, either or. Today we just hung out, nothin special but it went a lot better than I thought, got an A on all my hw, teachers didn't try and piss me off, and I got to be in Clint's arms all day, so it worked out. Now it's a 3 day weekend...yeah hardcore partyings gonna go on. The gangs gonna go on the beach and have a bon fire, get drunk, do w.e then crash at Clint's..so I gotta try and be semi good once we get there lol, but we'll have fun. PLUS Carlye's down..more pictures! lol. Well not much else to say, and if there were wouldn't be important lol soo ADIOS! LOVE YOU CLINT
