Can’t you realize that you idiot? But if you need a pizza sometime during the next few days I can have it delivered to you or maybe I will staple it to you. I don’t care what you want on it. Everything comes with pepperoni and with 9mm bullets on it. If you don’t like it, I don’t care cause you will receive one anyhow. The only difference is maybe the 9mm bullet will be in a gun or maybe they will be on your pizza. If you don’t screw around I’ll give you good pizza, if you do screw around I’ll take a pepperoni and punch it through your head. So if you want mushroom, shut up. If you want broccoli, what the hell is broccoli anyways. Shut up with the broccoli. If you want something crazy like pineapple I’ll kill you. If you like pepperoni and bullets you've come to the right place. If not you're an idiot you deserve to die. So, leave your name, number, serial number, how tall you are, whether you are susceptible to any diseases, and if you are I’ll come over and either give you a pizza or maybe ill break off your arm.
