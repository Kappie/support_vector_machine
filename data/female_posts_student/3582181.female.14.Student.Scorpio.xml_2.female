And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby    this song makes me sad.   it is a britney spears song and therfore i hate it. as i have hated her ever since i grew old enough to see that she was a skanky, self infatuated, consumer made hoe. oh well, nothings perfect.  what i DO like about it is that it a nice song... and that the fact that it is a nice song had nothing to do with britney spears, because she isn't smart enough to write her own songs or make up the lyrics.  i love music... it makes me feel uber good. my favorites change all the time and i like all sorts of styles. sometimes they sound like they are being played at the exact right moment in my life... like a coreographed movie scene......... freaky huh.  oh well, enough of my pointless ramblings..... i wish i could get a picture... for some reason blogger won't let me...  anywho, see you later singing off HUZZAH! oh and i hate britney spears.....
