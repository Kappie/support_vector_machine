It was visual-perception and involved staring at a dot on the screen and deciding if the 'right' diagonal lines disappeared; of course, it was more difficult than it sounded and required a whole lot of concentration.  Unfortunately, with the lights out, staring at a black computer screen and little white lines, when the white lines disappeared sometimes my retina still processed them as being there (although slightly faded) so I made a number of mistakes.  Often I would "mess up" many times in a row before getting back into the rhythm.  Oh well.  I got my credit.  Another one this afternoon and one more at 9am tomorrow.  These are both social so hopefully will not involve too much computer/eye work.  The day was further complicated by the fact that the network connection went dead in my suite.  So, no Internet.  This was extremely frustrating for all of us and I started to get withdrawal shakes.  I did manage to go to the library and find a vacant computer four times during the day, though.  My habit is strong!   Met a friend in PSY last night.  Maureen.  She just sat right next to me and started talking.  Works for me.  I haven't met anyone else in the four weeks of class so far.  When I got home I rattled out my OSAP application so that is taken care of for the fall.  I went grocery shopping this morning and took care of some backlogged emails this morning, then did some dissertation work through ProQuest.  I downloaded a couple of dissertations and to my amusement, found my thesis online as well.  I read the acknowledgments and dedication pages and had to laugh; I haven't seen them in over two years and some of the people I thanked for their friendship from afar definitely wouldn't be on that list today.    Appointment at 2, 4, and 5 this afternoon.  Out for dinner to a buffet-style restaurant right downtown tonight with M., so that should be good.  (Makes me wonder why I bothered going for groceries this morning though...)    That's about it.  Starting to study for the Psych midterm now.  Hard to believe it's less than two weeks away.  Leaders Debate in English tonight as well.  I find those utterly boring but I will turn it on for a little bit when I get home from dinner and see who is kicking butt.  I seriously doubt it will change who I intend to cast my vote for on Friday at the advanced polls, though!  In this riding, I actually saw two Liberal signs this morning.  First time.  There are probably 100 Olivia Chow signs in this street block alone, though.    More to come...
