These words announced the end of a performance in a Roman theatre, adn Emperor August said these words on his deathbed. I'm giving Marten points. Micheal, I'm not sure where you came up with that translation, but the reason the feminine part is in there is because fabula, is feminine. Otherwise, no one except Marten gets points. Sorry!  Anyways, your new quote is Crudelius est quam mori semper timere mortem. :-D Have fun. Think about the meaning!  Anyways, yeah. Just thought I'd update this. Sarah, as we all know, is in St. Louis right now. I went by and saw her mother yesterday. (And her father.)But that's a long story that unless you really want to know, don't ask. Ah well. I have to go get ready to leave!   "LOOK! Purple tuna!"
