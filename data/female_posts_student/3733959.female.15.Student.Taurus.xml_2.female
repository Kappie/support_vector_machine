Lauren was at the condo and Amanda and i just didnt make an effort to see each other. i made a bit of one but it didnt work for our schedules. So it felt really good that i could see my friends again and i dont think i realized just how MUCH i missed them until i saw them both again. Honestly(tw this movie called tank girl is one of the randomist, best movies i have ever seen....SEE IT!!). Anyways i get back from wasaga and now i cant get onto msn and its KILLING ME! i wanna talk to all the people who missed me while i was away for 5 days....well i hope people missed me lol. Niky? did u miss me? teehee...anyways yeah i was extremely bored so i decided to ramble out onto this blogger thing yet again. I think its going to become a bit of a habit for me now cuz it was the first thing i did on the computer besides checking email. Well, i would be chatting if i was aloud to download it onto this comp. mrah...anyways. Dont you love accessory shopping?? its something a woman can do and enjoy doing it because it has no real purpose...except to get crazy accessories that you can just show off tyo your friends. I went accessory shopping in wasaga cuz i had the money and wow it felt so damn good. i got a claddaugh (spellin) ring for only 10 bux!! its cheap for one of those things. I pointed the crown inwards cuz my heart doesnt belong to anyone. Meh. Anwyas im really just doing this for asolutely NO reason so im going to go do something else....something that doesnt involve much brain power cuz i am so dead right now. I can barely type. :D W00T!!! WASAGA!!!!
