I've never really thought that I would have the patience to sit down every day(or every other day for that matter) and type out my life. But then I realized... I probably need this. Maybe if it's written down, I'll finally be able to understand the vortex of words and ideas that are defined as my thoughts. Maybe I won't be quite so much the atypical angst-driven seventeen year old, and more the constantly thinking mature individual.  Or maybe I just don't have a life. *koffs*  In either case... we'll see how this goes. Who knows, it might be successful.  Onwards to more pressing stuff. Today they held the Reagan funeral procession(which consequently curtailed my movement - the crowds here in DC were really nasty). I've never had love for the man, personally. Even though he had a good personality, you could never accuse the man of being competent in dealing with some aspects of his job. Still, you have to respect anyone brave(or in Bush Jr's case, foolish) enough to sit in the "coveted" oval office for four or more years.  I have to give my respect to Reagan's wife, though. She held herself up very nicely, despite being paraded across the country(along with her husband's casket). There's a quiet nobility about her in the footage. It's admirable. Everyone may be saluting your husband, but I salute you.  Thus sayeth  The Refined Lady
