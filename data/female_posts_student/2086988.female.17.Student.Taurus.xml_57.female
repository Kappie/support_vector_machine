I so cannot wait till college, not only can we have all this, but we can get drunk and high and do it with other people! Anyways, Ms. Welch is a fucking bitch, this morning she was getting all over me, then I wanted to go to the library to work on our playwright project, and earlier she was talking about people majoring in theatre so I go up to her and I'm like yeah I'm going to major in theatre and she was like yeah you told me that once, but you know Ashley it's really hard and I think that if you don't get into alot of plays at school you can always do after school stuff. JESUS LIKE I SUCK THAT BAD, THANKS FOR RUINING MY DREAMS BITCH. Ahhh today is a day where I'm just like pissed at the world. Don't even get me started on Rhonda, you know not everyone can be perfect and really enough is enough. IT'S NOT THAT BAD. I got a cold too :(, yes I feel like bitching, and yes this is my blog, so I get to, and if you don't like it, press the freaking X button. One good thing about today, I'm getting my schedule changed to back to my old english class so that's good. Plus I mailed David our pics and a Bday card! Yay, I hope he like 'em. Ok, well I gotta a buttload of homework that I guess I'll do though I'm not in the mood, but whatever it's just german =p!   The first time ever I kissed your mouth I felt the earth move thru my hand
