You can't go off gossip,  Or first impressions   Look in the eyes  Check out the soul  They eyes are your only key to that   Deep Brown eyes  They show me love  compassion  Yet a hidden pain as well  Hazel eyes  They hold back  It's hard to read them  I see pain, love, confusion,  suffering  But they both mask it well  With smiles and jokes   I can do it better  I could make them think I was deliriously happy  or suicidally sad  So don't try and read me  Because no one can  So don't try  Because you can't
