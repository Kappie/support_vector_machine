After our stay in Cocoa Beach, my grandparents are driving me over to Panama City to stay with my church friends. Im happy about that. I went to Whitewater yesterday... that was awesome. Not many people went, like 15. I got really close to Callie and Amber Tolbert. Im glad, they are fun. I'll post when I get home from Flordia... Im getting ready to go to the movies with Kayla and Drew. See you in a week!!! *muah*
