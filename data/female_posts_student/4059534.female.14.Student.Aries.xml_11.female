All Blacks lost the rugby I am now going into deep depression. But it's not the end of the world! Because the All Blacks still won the bledisloe cup! AND we're going to kick Sth Africas bums. Oh well I don't care it's not like I can talk to anyone about rugby :( None of the girls watch it. All the guys go for some crappy AFL team. AFL sucks, it is very very very boring. Rugby is much better, I should go on a world tour preaching about rugby. Yes that's what I'll do. Oh and Kylie and Chloe got into McRobs!~!! Yay! Go you guys hope you do well and everyone MIGHT miss you... I didn't say they would just that I think they MIGHT. Nah they probably would.  Got to eat chocolate now.
