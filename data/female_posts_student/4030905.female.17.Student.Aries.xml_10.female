Cristofori worse. the piano sounds like broken glass and motorcycle at both extremes.  believe it or not..just now while practising the Bach piece, i almost cried cos i can't make it. plus my dad was watching tv..so noisy, can't hear myself. my bro damn irritating..talk to me halfway. damn lor...  hopefully i can pass..at least 101 marks. cos i plan to continue my theory after the exam. all the best to me.
