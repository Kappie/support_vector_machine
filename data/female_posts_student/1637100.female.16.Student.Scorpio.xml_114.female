LMAO), and then play need for speed for about 3 hours, then frances came over to make wontons for our home ec presentation on tuesday, eat dinner, then download/listen to music while playing addiction solitaire on yahoo games for the rest of the evening. a very productive day which is going to end soon with me going to phone terry. g'nite all =)
