Then dad comes waking me up at like 8 and i fall back to sleep and then i get up..and have to be ready to leave the house at 9..ughhh we go get his hair cut and i listen to his friend play guitar and some lady called me a "doll". we then left and proceeded to hell aka the 33rd annual fiddlers jamboree. god help me. i didnt complain for a solid 2 hours about the annoying sound of a fiddle, which by the way, is a violin..hello people. and the sound of a banjo killing my brain. i was like..dude get me outta here. I then finally had enough after 2 hours and some real lousy food. i ordered a chicken salad, like u know grilled chick on lettuce with salad dressing? no..they gave me that shit u put on bread to make a sandwhich on top of some lettuce..ugh. i ate half of it and decided i hated homecooked meal places, esp. if they serve it all on paper plates and make u eat with plastic spoons. hello, if i wanted that i would eat at home. whatever..   we come home and i talk to my 2 bros and kaela. i spent about over an hour on the phone with them. then i tied to call joe, just like i said i would. well, his grandfather answered and said "sorry hun, hes out playin ball and wont be back in for a while" i was like "oh..well good you please tell him his friend julia called?" and he said "sure hun" after repeating my name like 3 times. ju-lee-a?? yes, julia...JU-LEE-A?...yes, julia. his friend julia. ok JU-LEE-A. dude..havent people heard the name julia? i guess not up there in WV. anways, i really wanted to talk to him and i had worked up a lot of guts to call all the way to WV to a house full of people i didnt even know. I then realized..i didnt leave my number or anything. Bay told me that joe had called for her but she was at walmart..wow..i was shocked he called her. well i knew he'd call her back so i gave her my number to give to him. he did call back and she said he sounded really sad and all. he told me to call him back at like 7, so i was planning on it. 10mins later the phone rings and my dad answers and its joe. i was like yay its joe!! so i pick up the phone and im like "hey u!!" we make happy chat for a few mins and i ask him how hes feeling about things. he then tells me he loaded a shot gun yesterday but then a song came on the radio and it was weird..and it made him stop. god really does answer prayers. I told him once more he scares me sometimes and he told me he scares himself. i felt like during our whole conversation he was a stranger..or a guy i had a crush on..i was nervous when i talked to him and was always thinkin of what to say next, couldnt even form a complete sentence. anyways, after a few jokes and funny stories he sounded happy. i told him i would talk to him monday and he agreed. him saying "yup, i'll talk to ya monday!" made my day. It was great to hear his voice...and i just thought of something, a few months ago, i was trying to hook catherine up with joe cuz 1) hes not the prettiest picture in the world and 2) to get cat the fuck out of my life...now that i look back on that i think "omg, how could i think that about joe?! to set him up with catherine wood..whats wrong with me?!" he really means much more to me than that. i guess u dont realize how much u care for someone until they wake u up to reality. and GEEZ, catherine deserves worse than joe. lol and now joe thinks shes also nucking futs, so..all is dandy.   This damn fish keeps swimming up to the wall of the tank facing me and looking at me. i hear fish see things distorted cuz they're in water..maybe im pretty when distorted. lmao!   *much love and ba-zoo-ca joe* yes, i realize i sounded that out and didnt spell it correctly..
