Yet knowing how way leads on to way,  I doubted if I should ever come back  I shall be telling this with a sigh  Somewhere ages and ages hence:  Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-  I took the one less traveled by,  And that has made all the difference.   Some other quotes/saying i found interesting...   If I write your name on paper...  it can be thrown away  If I write your name on my hand...  it can be rubbed away  If I write your name on sand...  it can be washed away  For if I write your name on my heart...  there is no way it can go away   If I could be anything in this world,  I would beyour tear drop.  I was born from your eyes,  Live on your checks,  and die on your lips.   @-}-}--- CRUSH --}-}-@  It takes only a minute  to get a crush on someone,  An hour to like someone,  And a day to love someone.  But, it takes a lifetime to forget someone.   It takes a billion tiny snowflakes,  To make a blanket of snow,  It takes a million tiny stars,  To light up the darkest skies.  But it only takes  One simple kiss,  To make me fall for you.   ...Scientific of love making...   1. Sex is a beauty treatment.
