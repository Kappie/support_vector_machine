Then worst felt feverish, polytechnic school fees payment slip came. Have to make payment on 7th of August. Wow, only 3 days to dig out the money. So I postpone the interview to 4pm. Tried to catch up on my sleep, slept till 2pm. Woke up less feverish and less bodyaches. But head was heavy or bloated as if going to burst. Movement was damn slow, bathing, makeup. Aiya! Finally threw in the towel to gave up. Cause really no energy, called the agency to postpone to Friday 11am Gave a stupid lame excuse about lecturer wanting to see me.  Friday, woke up 8.45am. Was in a normal mood but my mom had to give me crap again. I was really in a bad mood, so I lecturer her. I told her the reports I had to complete by next week. Supply Chain Management, I had to write report on Market size and share. A bit on logistics and shipping, her eyes opened wide. Then I go on with my Business Development, I had to write introduction on our childcare center start up project and business ethics on childcare. She was finding hard to absorb. Then I carried on, on E-commerce, I had to write report on Companies that  provide online music downloads their success and failure.... The list is long, by then her eyes and mouth were wide opened. My mom always underestimate what I meant by busy and stress. She kept saying no one gave me stress. Will the truth is my main source of stress came from her. Ironic but true, the other sources of stress are friends, school, finding jobs and housework.  My mom then bullshit rebut me, saying that what does my lecturer do if we are doing so much.  Hey come on lar! We students are the one getting the diploma, not the lecturers.  Really cannot stand her arrogance and ignorance.  Then her bullshitting continues, what about your group members! Why are they pushing all the work to you!  I was nearly at a stage of vomiting blood... I told her off, we distributed the work evenly. I told you right, my projects will be a lot and heavy. This shows how big is one subject's project is!  She of course was shock but *sigh* she still want to argue.  Sometimes I wonder am I the Parent or the Child.  Anyway, today my interview I was darn late cause the 106 bus was really snailing on the road.  I saw cars, lorries, trucks, vans, buses drove pass the bus I am on...  Really snail. So I got there late around 12pm.    Why was I that late?  I left home around 10:40am, reach bukit batok interchange at 11am.  Miss a 106 bus, the bus schedule said 106 will leave at  11:05am but it was late, cause it arrived at 11:10am. Then it snail along the road.............. I panicked, alighted at the wrong bus stop, one bus stop before the actual one. Reached there, it was lunch time. I was told to come back at 1pm plus. Took my lunch at Tanglin Mall Mcdonald's.  1pm plus, interview delayed cause the HR person not around. So a last min person was there to interview me. Then due to my lack of expertise in Access software, in 10 mins I was rejected!!!!  Wow....Really so crappy today.
