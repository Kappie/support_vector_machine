Is that supposed to be funny or fake or something? It sounds like the Main Line to me!! Anyway, I thought it was very funny, no masterpiece, but comical and enjoyable.  I'm a little more into the routine of camp now. The days are still long, but not as long as Monday seemed. I have one girl I really like who goes to my old elementary school and she gives me massages. Sometimes I'll watch other girls while we're together but it's usually it's just me and Natalie. Camp is so small this year that that's ok. This girl Natalie, who is absolutley as small as it comes, she must weigh 40 lbs, told me today how she thinks her thighs are HUGE, that's a quote. I don't think I had that feeling till at least the end of elementary school, and she just finished 4th grade. I guess it's getting younger and younger, it's an epidemic.  Off to rehersal and Exton Diner tonight.
