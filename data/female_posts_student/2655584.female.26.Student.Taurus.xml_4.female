"we dont know who called you and said such things!  we would not do that.  you were suppose to be here.  you are on probation and will be written up."  well, after much debate.  and managment finally checkin their call logs on the front desk phone it turn out someone did make a call to my number that morning.  no one is pointing fingers.  i still get blamed.  only two people were their that early.  the receptionist and one of the designers.  of course the receptionist is make a good chunk more than i am and has said that she does not want me taking her hours.  it is not hard to put two and two together.  however, even after writing the store manager twice, she still wins.  she has connections, is a yup. herself, and is not guilty till proven (caught in the act).  so i will still get written up for not being at work.  of course i said fuck this trifling yuppie shit and quit.  granted that this can happen anywhere, i just didnt think that it would happen where people considered themselves above shit like that.
