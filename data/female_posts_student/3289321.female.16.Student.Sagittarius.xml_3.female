And I want so bad to make a difference in someone's life...to really show them the love of God, and hopefully lead the way to Him.  That's my top priority this summer and the next school year.    I wanna be beautiful Make you stand in awe Look  inside my heart And be amazed I want to hear you say Who I am is quite enough I just want to be worthy of love and beautiful  Sometimes I wish that I was someone other then me Fighting to make the mirror happy Trying to find whatever is missing Dont you help me back to love me ^"Beautiful" - Bethany Dillon    Later  >  Btw, Benny B..I'm so sorry for all that you're dealing with right now.  I'm praying for you buddy.  Remember, the clock doesnt matter...you can call me anytime you need to talk.  Keep your head up, things will look better tomorrow.
