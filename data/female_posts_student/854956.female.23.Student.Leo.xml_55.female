I'm in the process of changing from individual comments (on each blog post) to automatic ones... so IGNORE the post that have 2 comment links.  After awhile, there will only be one.  Also, I had signed up for a counter with digits.com, but later decided to continue my search for a prettier one.  Lo and behold, I found one that has a frog, so it HAD to be added to my blog.  :-)  I picked up the number of hits I've gotten overall with it... so, nothing's changed about that.  :-)  Okay, enough about that.    The Weekend    Well, I didn't do a WHOLE lot this weekend in the way of studying (like I should have).  Saturday I woke up and kinda bummed around a bit, then my parents and I began cleaning out the patio room.  We've had boxes stacked up in there for YEARS.  That's right... we've used it as a storage space since we moved in here before my Junior year.  We're pack rats, and so we have a LOT of stuff that we've accumulated through the years.  Some things were pleasant to find, like my middle school yearbooks.  Some things I bid good riddance to.  Like dolls, and the better part of my stuffed animal collection.  Those will be taken to Goodwill.  I figure since they're all in good shape, some other kids can get play time and comfort as well as company from them.  :-)  Okay, what else did I do?  Well, Saturday night Druck came over to personally give me my Valentine's Day card, which was wonderful.  Then he and I went to a movie with Melissa and her brother.  We saw  urlLink How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days , and it was pretty funny!  I laughed a LOT... I laughed harder than I've laughed in a while!!!  It was worth it... but then again, RICKY would shake his head and say, "But you like girly, corny, silly, CUTE little movies!"  This is true, but even Melissa's brother seemed to enjoy it a lot... and Brandon is usually very critical of movies.  Okay... then I got home and fell asleep.    This morning I woke up, and went through the adds.  Then I found my camera, so I have it ready for next weekend (I have to use the rest of the film... and I can't think of any others that I'd want to take pictures of than Ricky, Druck, Wolf, and any others that are in Austin next weekend and hang out with us).  Okay, so then my parents and I ate dinner, and I studied for a couple classes, as well as practicing for my proficiency which is on Tuesday.  I'm not nervous at all... I just wanna get it over with.  Then on Thursday we have our group presentation.  We have to teach a singing game to the rest of the class, we also have to play them an original ABA form song that I wrote (we split up all the different parts), show them an original painting, read them an original poem, and show them architecture.  All of these things must have the common theme of structure, form, etc.  It's a Related Arts project.  We're going to ace it.  The rest of my group is really great.  Minus one gal who can't count music for shit... but hopefully she'll get better.  I have my first Politics exam on Friday... and my Mom keeps telling me I should get the guy in there to meet up with me and study.  I dunno about that... but then again, we'll see.  :-)  Alrighty, any other news about school?  Not much... I'll update during the week... and be on the lookout for "WACKY WEDNESDAY!"  :-)  Talk to ya people later!  Oh, I hope Alexis got her Valentine's E-card!!!  But, I got like an error email about that addy... if so then I guess I'll just wait for the next holiday to send her an e-card...!  ; )
