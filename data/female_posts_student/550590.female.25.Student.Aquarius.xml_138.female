I was supposed to go to Orlando this weekend to work on my house, but instead I'm vegging on the couch just a few more days, and I'll go south next weekend instead. I took some pictures of the work in progress, and I'll get them developed at some point in the near future, but you still won't be able to comprehend the transformation of the house from the nightmare it was before. My grandmother is convinced that I will never want to move out of that house once it's finished. Maybe I can take the house with me to Washington when I move there eventually.   Bruce and I went to see the Matrix yesterday. I'm still not sure whether or not I like it. The idea of it is awesome, of course, but I'm still not able to buy Keanu Reeves as any sort of intelligent being. Bruce made the point that most of the characters don't seem to have any emotions (voice, facial expressions etc) which I suppose goes along with the transcending nature of the world they've created, but it doesn't make it a good excuse for bad acting. We were more entertained by the fact that they had decorated the wall outide the theatre itself than we were by the movie. We also saw X-2 recently, which was awesome. I told Bruce yesterday that I wanted to start reading the comic books to which he replied "I just had an orgasm" in the middle of the crowded theatre waiting for the Matrix to start. I just wish it weren't so expensive to buy the original comic books. I have enough money I have to spend trying to pay off all my credit cards before I move to Orlando to become a poor college student again.  The good news is that I have a job lined up and an internship that includes a stipend at the end of the semester, so that's going to pay some of the bills. I'm just looking forward to the fact that this will be my last move for at least a couple years. The bad news is that means I have to start packing up all my crap again. Sigh.  In two weeks Bruce and I will be in DC for our anniversary which will be a nice little vaction. We're staying in Crystal City and playing tourist for a few days. Aside from being sick and having a little former-intern chaos to deal with for the past week or so, the semester is going relatively well. I'll probably be a little more sad as we get closer to July. Right now I'm just excited that everything seems to be going along according to plan. At the same time, it kind of makes me wonder how long this streak of luck will last...Never fear, the eternal pessimist is still alive and well in Gainesville.
