It was really fun though, and we managed to spread opening our presents over three days! I just opened my last one which was some cool lights for my room. *which is the first and only temple dedicated to me* ... Ahh! I have to go work out my feng shui garden and watch Galaxy Quest! (Actual blog when brain meets body) *sometime tomorrow* Pika Shuichi!
