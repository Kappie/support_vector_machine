I think that I am going to make a St. Patty's Day Layout first. Well, yeah. I just thought that I should come here and write about Saturday night or something, but I am too lazy. Just read Ellen's entry here: http://www.livejournal.com/~reefsun/36376.html.   THat is basically it. Today was nothing really. School was so-so. I got charged with truency (skippping class) and received a 4 hour Saturday detention. But... I was in the nurse, so we got it all cleared up and now I am good to go. :)   My grandpa is pretty sick... He need to get a pacemaker for his heart. I think that he already got that, but need surgery tomorrow. I can tell that it is really stressing out my mom who is already pretty bitchy already. I feel bad for ehr and I am worried that something like this could push her over the edge or something. Now is a time that I really wished that I believed in God because I could turn to him for comfort... My grandpa has really strong faith, so atleast he knows that Jesus is watching over him. I just don't know what I believe anymore...   I have this freaking huge lump on my head. It isn't like a pimple, but it is sooo freaking annoying! My mom said it was prob an inverted pimple or something.   Oh, and on Sunday I was outside all day in my bathing suit and I got soooo sun burnt! It hurts! It is much better today because I have been putting aloe on it all the time. But then I went out bicycling again today. Hopefully my shoulders aren't too burnt. :P   Yay! Tuesday after Spring Break me, Ellen, and Brian are going to see Story of the Year at this place downtown called Numbers. Ellen's mom is driving. She doesn't know it, but we have been all the way down there (refer to Ellen's Sat nite anecdote LOL).   Sometimes I don't think that Brian likes me that much, but I also think that I am overreacting. Because I have that feeling when he is not around or when I am not talking to him, but then wehn I talk to him or when I am around him he is really sweet. It is just my mind playing tricks on me, right? I think that I just need to work on trusting him that is all...   Ellen is soooo much better about Brian too. She likes to invite him places and stuff now which is cool.   Aww it will be a month that me and Brian have been going out on Friday. I think that I should do somethign because I know that he won't remember, but I don't know what to do. Besides, on Friday I am going shopping I think! Yay for shopping!   Hmm I am going to go now and try to figure out what to do for our one month anniversary. :)
