Well, as y’all can probably see, I decided it was time to get a brand new template.  While I really enjoyed the purple and still have it saved on my computer, I LOVE to lighthouse layout!  Everyone who knows me knows that I am a lover of lighthouses!!    Now that we are on break between spring and summer –thank GOD- I have some extra time to play around with my projects  writing, including this blog.    I hope y’all like it as much as I do… oh and now, you can post comments to my blogs.  I know that a friend moved her site to Xanga to be able to get the comments feature.  Well, now it comes on basic Blogger for free!! Yipee!  Also, check out my friend  urlLink Jenn’s  blog!
