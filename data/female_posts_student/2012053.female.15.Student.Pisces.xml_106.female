( i saw the coolest shoes ever and they were by marc jacobs! they were green with a white and green strap across, they were perfect! and they were only like $229!)  haha  then we went to sephora and i got this cool stila lipstick  it's pink  and i got this cool bag, it's hurley which is weird because i hate skater crap  then we just looked at different stores  and then we came home which was good   because i'm tired  and wah, my head hurts
