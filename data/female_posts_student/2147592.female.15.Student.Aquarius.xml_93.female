Keon Bryce, Fate Wilson)   {Fate Wilson} Okay, I remember the days High Rise, Lil Lefts, Even Stevens and Faze Troops Lotto and BK's those was the days High tech boots spray paintin' wit'cha name T-shirts airbrushed that read the same They carryin Bone's chain One gone but yo we miss ya' Harris photos school shots can you remember Bury him told his bitch go to the perm and die Didnt lie shot his-self in the head with the 4-5 When she disobeyed hand off clated craze Just to reiterate dog those was the days Fo' da invasions of hatas I aint cool to mile around Use to get down at True Flavas bumpin Key Lo Walkin' damage cross colored and Paco While play more step than talent shows Prom nights tux and cane know its so cool Fuck them new model cars we ridin' old school (old school)  {Chorus - Keon Bryce} We was runnin so hard Hard to survive Cause eventhough we were young We had to stay strong No matter what we went through It was me and my crew And thats how we win When we were kids  {Fate Wilson} In 3 months we stayed in Jamestown Hamwood and Diplomats Played with Transformers, G.I. Joe's and Thundercats We was lovin' that Before to started jackin jacks For notes from Red Oaks had folks scared to come through Collis Park after dark Crown Victorias police armored cars Be aware...wang wiggas was out there But we didnt care kids was gettin' stabbed and ditched out there To busy playin'...Double Dare You touched shorty on the ass that's a bet Want ya Kool-Aid and sugar smack ya hands and say sweat It's mine now place it in my Louie Vaton pouch Thump a nigga on his knuckles make him say ouch Slout socks box Chevy Caprice Hot knees cut da holes Disturbing Tha Peace Wit no conscience broke niggas call em nonsense No com-mission little faded payin' homage  {Chorus - Keon Bryce} We was runnin so hard Hard to survive Cause eventhough we were young We had to stay strong No matter what we went through It was me and my crew And thats how we win When we were kids  {Ludacris} I had a Long John but no Silver No gold or plat I was simply red from the years I been holdin' back With 2 sides to a book I lick stamps and light matches And set fires in garbage pales and cabbage patches A child of the corn been wild since I was born Climbin' over barb wire clothes got torn Shoes got muddy and my click turned cruddy Wherever I go they went they my buddy I brush teef brush naps and cause treats Dreamin' of Cadillac with wheels and plush seats Cats with gold teeth and raps with such beats Macks with no grief and some sacks of green leaf When I loaded my cap gun I was ready for ACTION! Starin' at beer cans and a moment to crack one Wanna hang with the big boys and play with the big toys And 'buse the people makin all that gotdamn noise  {Chorus - Keon Bryce (x2)} We was runnin so hard Hard to survive Cause eventhough we were young We had to stay strong No matter what we went through It was me and my crew And thats how we win When we were kids  Thank you xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
