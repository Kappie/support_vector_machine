A school teacher marries the prince, becomes princess.)  Then, when the King andQueen dies, and the prince becomes King, the princess (his wife) becomes Queen.  BUT, if a "common man" marries the princess, he will become prince.  Here's the fun part for all the girls.  When the princess becomes Queen, the prince (her husband) can't become King.  Its against British law.  How cool is that?  Maid Marion wears a dress and stands upright and plays badmitton, isn't that mostly human?  If Belle isn't technically a princess, then neither is Cinderella.  Or Maid Marion.  We're talking after marriage.    Wow Josh.  I'm sorry, I just really shot you down in that post.
