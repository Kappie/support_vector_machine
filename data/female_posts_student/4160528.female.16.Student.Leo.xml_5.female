Why women can't put on mascara with their mouth closed?   Why don't you ever see the headline "Psychic Wins Lottery"?   Why is "abbreviated" such a long word?   Why is it that doctors call what they do "practice"?   Why is it that to stop Windows 98, you have to click on "Start"?   Why is lemon juice made with artificial flavor, and dishwashing liquid made with real lemons?   Why is the man who invests all your money called a broker?   Why is the time of day with the slowest traffic called rush hour?   Why isn't there mouse-flavored cat food?   When dog food is new and improved tasting, who tests it?   Why didn't Noah swat those two mosquitoes?   Why do they sterilize the needle for lethal injections?   You know that indestructible black box that is used on airplanes? Why don't they make the whole plane out of that stuff?!   Why don't sheep shrink when it rains?   Why are they called apartments when they are all stuck together?   If con is the opposite of pro, is Congress the opposite of progress?   If flying is so safe, why do they call the airport the terminal?     ~((TrUsT)) **Hardest thing to earn** **Easiest thing to lose**   ~At least two people in the world love you so much they would die for you. At least 15 people in the world love you in someway. The only reason anyone would hate you is because they want two be just like you. A smile from you can bring happiness to anyone even if they don't like you. Every night SOMEONE thinks of you before they go to sleep. You mean the world to someone. If not for you someone may not be living. you are special and unique. Someone that you don't even know exists, loves you. Always remember the compliments. Forget the rude remarks. If you have a great friend take the time to let them know how much they mean to you.  ~What would you do if every time you fell in love with someone you had to say good-bye?   What would you do if every time you wanted someone they would never be there?  What would you do if for every moment you were truly happy there would be 10 moments of sadness?  What would you do if your best friend died tomorrow and you never got to tell them how you felt?  What would you do if you loved someone more than anything else and you could never have them?  Some people live and some people die.   ~When it hurts to look back, and you're scared to look ahead, you can look beside you and your BEST FRIEND will be there.  ~Love starts with a smile, grows with a kiss, and ends with a tear.=(  ~Don't cry over anyone who won't cry over you.  ~East to the sea, west to the lands, death to the girl who touches MUH man!!!!  ~You don't love someone because they're beautiful.

You don't always see them, but you know they are always there.  ~Don't frown. You never know who is falling in love with your smile.  ~Every hottie with a body, needs a cutie with a bootie!  ~"You know you're in love when you think about someone more times in a day than you think about yourself."  ~Only little boys who call themselves men say I love you, and don't mean it.   ~Whats betta? a lie that draws a smile or the truth that draws a tear?  ~Last night I looked up at the stars And matched each one with a reason why I love you I was doing great, but then I ran out of stars.  ~No guy is worth your tears  when you find one that is, he won't make you cry.  ~A heart is not a play thing~a heart is not a toy~but if you want it broken..just give it to a boy !!  ~Live life to its fullest...you never know wut days guna be your last!  ~Find a guy who will stay awake to watch you sleep.  ~What do you do when the only person who can make you stop crying is the person who made you cry?  ~Nobody is perfect until you fall in love with them.  ~Hug only those who hug u back, kiss only those who kiss you back and love only those who love you back.  ~To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world.  ~2 ThiNGS In LiFe Sh0uLd NeVeR Be BroKen...PrOmiSes, and HeArTs.  ~Love is giving someone the ability to destroy you but trusting them not to.  ~There's only so many people a person can love.. and when you find that one person you've been looking for, just hold on for as long as you can.. because you never know how long it'll be until that other person decides to just leave you.. promising they'll be back, but who knows if they really will.                .•:º  Learn From You’re Past, Move On  Grow Stronger  º:•.    .•:º   [(..People Are Fake But Let Your Trust Last Longer..)]  º:•.        .•:º  Do What You Have To Do But Always Stay True  º:•.     .•:º And Never Let Anyone -----> . . .Get The Best Of You   º:•.

How could you not know that its you that I adore? I love ur big strong arms and the way they hold me tight. I love it how, when u kiss me, I know everythings alright. Even though I love you, theres still some things I hate. I hate it when u talk to her and say "It must be fate." I hate all of the struggles and the hell you put me through, but everytime i think about it, i realize im too good for you*  *i believe in angels, the kind that heaven sends. im surrounded my angels, but i call them my best friends.  *if my girls jumped off a bridge, i wouldnt jump, id be at the bottom to catch them  *we weren't sisters by birth, but we knew from the start fate brought us together to be sisters by heart.  *friends laught at your silliest jokes, put up with your pissiest moods, go along with your craziest ideas, and still always see the best in you.  *you know someone is your friend when u have a big smile on your face, and they still know somethings wrong  *a friend is one who believes in you when u have ceased to belive in yourself.  *a true friend is someone who walks in when everyone walks out
