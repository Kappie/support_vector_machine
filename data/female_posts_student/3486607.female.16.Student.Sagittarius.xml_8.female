Then those that lie to get their way, those that lie to attempt not to hurt another. There are those that say one thing and then act entirely opposite of that. Then there are the "friends" that dont want anything to do with you over something so incredibly stupid. Ah, the people who think that they should kill themselves because of another person. Those that mess around with others feelings. The people that like to hurt others to make themselves feel better. And then just those that have been annoying me.  If you are reading this and happen to fall in the catagories, I'm sorry. This doesn't even apply to some people. Just my way of getting out my frustration and anger at certain people that are annoying me lately without using names and offending people.
