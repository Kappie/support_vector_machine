I don't want my friends to go through the same things I went through. I regret them very much.  The day went by pretty good I just talked on the phone adn sat on the comp, cleaned some and junk and they day was all great until about 10 or 11 whenever it was my dad was an idiot and let our un fixed male idiot cat out. Well we had a search party we had to look for him well then we hear an awful male cat fight across are street in someones back yard. Well we had to come in and my mom starts B****ing at my dad. Drunk at that matter, threw stuff around loudy got my dad off his lazy but and outside sending all 3 of us kids to bed so she could yell at my dad without feel bad fter scaring the crap outa us.
