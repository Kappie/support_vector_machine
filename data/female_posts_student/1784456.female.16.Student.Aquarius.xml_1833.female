Its not fair, i really wanted to go to emilys sleepover but i cant cos i am working and i wanted to go to all of the party in the afternoon but i cant cos i am working. i wont be thre til about 4:30, so i will have missed an hour and i will be starving because so that i can be there by 4:30 i am working thru my lunch hour, so as soon as i get there all the food will disappear! (nothing unusual there, then) Biology thismorning was soo cool. We got to cut up a liver, and kimmi was completely grossed out by it all so i waved a bit in her face, and then she saw the half filled pot that the liver pieces came out of and freaked! I am deffo doing Bio, Geog, Psych and DT next year. Its gonna be hard work and alot of money but it should be fun! (£250 for the geog trip and at least £200 for the bio trip!) gotta go, cant wait to see shrek 2 tomorrow, but have no idea what to wear!
