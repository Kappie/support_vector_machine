Reds hold a subtly seductive power that promotes confidence and refreshment.  However, my days of red are over- at least for the time being.  I just went brunette- and might I say- I look pretty darn good ( I have to keep this Pg because my family reads this).  LOL    Anyways, so on a more important issue:  my college search coming along quite well ( Although my aunt thinks even though I'm smart even to go Ivy League, I shouldn't because I need a backup.)  My list is as followed:   The UK  ( In the UK, you can apply to 6 colleges on one application, so I decided to take advantage of that)    University of Reading    Queen's University of Belfast    University of Glasgow    University of London Royal Holloway    Oxford University   Washington DC      Georgetown University- Early decision   Massachusetts      Wellesley College- All girls, I know, but as far as political careers for women, it's the top of the top   New York      New York university   California      UCLB- It's my safety school  For those of you who did not know, I really want to get into politics (I'm thinking eventually maybe Senate) So I thus plan on practicing New York Law ( everyone who is successful in politics starts off in New York Law.  Another (final) tidbit:  Although  I am not democratic, I find it rather fascinating that Chelsea Clinton attends Oxford, Hillary went to Wellesley, and Bill went to Georgetown.  Perhaps I really will succeed in politics  PEACE OUT, Brit
