Today,I was very lazy'causeI didn't do anything.. AHA.. I just slept whole day. That was only thing whatI did today.After taking nap at daytime, I visited Loblaws to buy some stuff for a living for example, Those were My facial forming cleanser and body washer.   My roommate, Jay is telling me that wenow have ONLY $10.15 for this month. It makes me depressed. Now, I have to finish my diary for tomorrow.
