Math: again, painfully easy  Tomorrow's predictions: Aerobics: there shouldn't even be a freaking exam for this class BCIS: excel part will be a little challenging, power point will be easy  Right so, i should be studying before i go represent at the hockey game tonight.....but i'm not.  Oh well.  Coppell vs. Grapevine tonight at 8pm.....take a break from studying and come support.    I just need to tell all the people in my classes that i'll miss after this tri:  French: i'll miss you Peteria, Xena, Kendra, Siru, Alex, Kate, Ani, J-P, Kristen, JoBeth, Jessi!!!! English: i'll miss you Cameron, Boah, Niki, Adam, Kevin, Brandon, Charlie (our sitting-next-to-each-other-in-every-freaking-class-we-have-together-because-our-names-are-always-after-one-another-in-alphabetical-order bond will not be broken!!! lol), Dana, Elizabeth!!! Geometry: i'll miss you Cheryl, girl who sits in front of me (sorry i don't know your name!), Rachel, Rahja (did i spell it right?), Adam Hartwick (haha i have to call you that or i get you confused! lol, you're my fave freshman! but lay off the drugs ok, lol!) Aerobics: i'll miss all of you guys even the bitchy freshmen girls in which one is confused on her skincolor!!!  Varsity P.E Hockey Cup Champions 03-04 lol!!!!  We had some good times, lets do it again next year! BCIS: I'll miss you Kate (i'll miss you the most, its going to be no fun squealing, being nasty, being really abnoxious/loud or asking the nerdy teacher personal questions without you next tri!!!  Be in BCIS 5th period next tri!), Nathan, Luther, Matt T., Freshman girl in the back corner with the adorable clothes! (sorry i don't know your name), Nina, Michelle, the other Matt, Brandon, Chase, Lindsay, Jennifer, Shannon!  ^^^^^I love you all!!!!!!!  Alright gotta go, i need to find something entertaining to do....its times like these where i wish i could drive........right about now, i would go see Miracle for my 5th time just so i could beat Brittany even MORE SO in our competition.....but thats not possible as of now  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
