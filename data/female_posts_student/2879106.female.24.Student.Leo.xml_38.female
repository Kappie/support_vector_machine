Right now he is in the kitchen making popcorn so that is why I am taking this time now to write. Last night we watched the movie Secret Window and today we watched The Last Samurai. Both great flicks and I would recommend them both to anyone. The Secret Window wasn't one of Johnny Depp's best movies but it was good and the Last Samurai was long so plan to make several potty breaks.  Other than that I really liked them both. (Alek just came back in and he has a twislers in his mouth trying to do the Lady and the Tramp  spagetti scene.) He is so funny! Anyway we are going to watch Sports Night now so I will write more later. I have something I really want to talk to you about but for right now I need to  give my attention to Alek. LOVES TO EVERYONE!!!
