This all roots back to a bad part of my life which I'm trying desperately to forget... unfortunately that "bad part" reared its ugly head, and caused me to think about things that I haven't thought about for the past 9 months.  I'll be okay eventually... it's just going to take time.  Fortunately, I have good friends who have given me their perspectives on things... and while I sorta wish that it hadn't come about the way it did... in the long run it will be effective and helpful.  So... on to happier things...    Yesterday I got the new  urlLink 311  cd.  It's okay... not the same as the other ones, though.  It's not as energetic and in-your-face, but I think it may partly be because I haven't listened to it enough to really get into the songs.  What did I do today?  HAHAHA  Excuse me, but I had to laugh because I didn't do much of anything.  I woke up at like, 12:30... I talked to my Mom about the aforementioned "bad part" of my life... cried a lot... went back to sleep... woke up... talked to Melissa... worried that Jennifer was mad at me... called her to talk about it... cried on the phone (which was embarrassing, because I hate crying in front of people... or having people hear me cry... but I just couldn't help it this time)... got things with that all sorted out, though... and well... then I ate, because my Mom had been bugging me all day to eat something and I figured I probably should.  Yep... what a great day, right?   Tomorrow... me and Melissa (and hopefully Jennifer, too) are going to  urlLink Canyon Lake  for a while.  Probably not a LONG time, because well... eh.  Then, I don't know what we're doing afterwards tomorrow night... we'll just see.  I'm hoping that the more I do, the less time I'll have to think about other stuff... and hopefully that'll turn out well.  Anyhow, I don't have anything else to post right now... I'm just hoping everything gets better by next week.  I'd hate to have a crappy birthday because I'm wallowing in sadness about this whole thing.
