The television claims this as "reality" TV. But come on who are they trying to fool? In which world is it reality to be given a million bucks for solving clues placed all round the world? Or for that matter no guy in the world will be allowed to openly flirt with 10 girls at one time and finally choose one. Its all pretty dumb if you think about. It's all made up situations just for entertainment. But I must admit it is fun watching these hysterically funny shows.  Most of these shows have little depth and just brings out the worst in people. To get the prize money in the end, many of the contestants in these "reality" shows turn into complete money hungry hypocrites who do not care less about the feelings of others. Maybe I'm being a little harsh here but still... I'm sure you know what I mean...
