Also, the DVD had a "making of..." segment that included interviews with Guccione, McDowell, the director, Gore Vidal (the author), and some of the extras.  The orgy scene was directed and produced by the Gooch himself, and did not involve any of the stars.  A lot of Penthouse Pets, enough guys to keep it interesting, and at least one "little person".  As for the violence,  Clockwork Orange  seemed more beatings than killings.  Not so with  Caligula , which had that decapitation machine (sort of a street sweeper with blades), several bloody murders - one including castration, and a "fantasy" scene early on where McDowell imagines all kinds of naked people dying horrible deaths - an early glimpse into his psyche.  I'd like to see  Spiderman , but  Monsters  is the one we're waiting for.  And  Lord of the Rings .  And  Harry Potter .  Can you say "arrested development"?    Daf
