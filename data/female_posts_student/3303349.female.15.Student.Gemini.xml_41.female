Which I am actually getting! Tan! For once in my life! It's so insanely crazy...Yeah sure as I say that the clouds roll over...hum...can'type...maybe it's because I just got up and haven't been doing anything more stimulating than read articles about polititions arguing over gay marrage...Still stand the way I always have...you all know that...if not go into the archives you smart ones...I really should be enjoying this time of silence cause God knows I'm not gonna hear much of it today...Yay my sanity is really gonna be gone! Wo ho I can finnaly go to the institution! Then I can be normal...now there's something to look forward to...ha I am so pathetic...oh well...I can live with that...
