(speaking of julia stiles, in an interview for tour guides i conducted today, a job candidate, when asked what celebrity he would like to be his guide, lucidly described why julia stiles would be the greatest guide. because she's not only beautiful and famous, she lives in residence at columbia university. so she's real, too. it was fantastic)   after i left my hairdresser (a move that it took me months to make), i saw another hairdresser a few times, but we just had no chemistry at all. so i changed salons. i've now gone through three stylists at this one salon, because they all keep quitting. maybe i should have never left michelle. i seem to have picked up some serious bad karma that i just can't shake.
