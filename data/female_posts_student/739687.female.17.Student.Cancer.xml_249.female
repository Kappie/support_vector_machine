I hate to say it, but i needed this. Sometimes I need to sigh a little bit, rather than just pretend that I'll be happy forever. I can't pretend that that sort of thing would ever happen. I don't like to pretend.  I mean, don't get me wrong, I've been happy lately. I am happy. Things are good and life isn't worth getting all melodramatic over. But today was just the kind of day that's typical of being human. It's this kind of blah and sadness that I haven't had in a long time. Longer than I can recall. It's just a normal feeling of being down. It's not extreme. And that's why it's so unusual. Because I'm always at extremes. Today calmed me down from that streak of foolish, unruly happiness. About 2 weeks ago I had this horrible breakdown in the midst of my happy streak. It was soo strange. I was just sitting, folding towels like normal, and suddenly I felt weighted down. I felt stressed, and I felt tense, like I was going to snap. I started screaming at my mom and just spazzing out and I still have no idea why. I was screaming at the top of my lungs, hyperventilating, going crazy...and I don't know why. And then I started crying. I was bawling and sobbing so hard, for like 15 to 20 minutes. Then I just stopped. I sat there and just blanked out, stared off, and my mind went blank. It was like I had no more emotions left in me. I was drained. It was frightening, but calming.  But today isn't like that. It's more normal, it's just nice. I feel drained of emotions, but in a good way, and without the extremes beforehand.  And don't get me wrong, I'm not a dramatic person. I despise drama. I typically don't like talking about blah-de-blah stupid shit. It was just an interesting little occurance that I suddenly felt compelled to write about. I hate drama. The way people wind themselves up in their intricate little soap opera story lines. Life isn't a drama. Life's meant to be enjoyed, not plagued and torn and scattered. So collect yourselves, you insecure children, and learn to stop worrying about things.  Don't stress over the past, because it's too late; relax in the present, because nothing is as urgent as you make it; and take the future in strides, because things will take care of themselves.   Life's too short to place tears where there could be laughter.  Well, tomorrow is banquet (hooray!), and I have a room to clean and a hairstyle to pick out.  Stop the drama, crazies.
