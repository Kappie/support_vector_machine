You wouldn't know what we were talking about. And don't give me that 'don't exclude me' crap because if one of your friends come over if i ask you if i can borrow a hair thing it's all ALLIE GET OUT OF HERE GOD! *more fake crying*" so then she shut up. And then mom gets home and gio makes it seem like i'm not going at all (as in that's what she told mum while i was in the shower) and then mom's talking to me and i'm like um no i'm going with madeline, and then she gives me this "i'm dissapointed in you" look. And dad's like "you're just going to blow your sister off" and i'm like "yeah so i'm the bad guy because you guys guilted me into taking her and you're pissed because i don't want to" and then dad said something like "yeah well then we'll see who is gonna come and visit you in the hospital when you have a stroke or something" and mom had to physically hold me back. god he pisses me off so much. And i would have said something like "who the fuck are you to judge, i'm doing a hell of a lot better now than you were at my age" (because he was a pot head through high school and college) but i really NEEDED to get out of the house and i figured something like that would get me grounded. So i silenced myself. But god i am so happy i'm going out somewhere. I can't stand being around them all the time. ah, god bless super sunday. Mom was like "don't stay there too long" and i'm like "yeah whatever" i.e. um, i don't think so mother.
