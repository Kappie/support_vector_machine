And they encourage people that if they feel that God is saying something particular to them, for the benefit of everyone then they should go up and tell one of the leadership people and they can help you decide if its for you or for everyone.  And every now and again someone gets up and says something.  Each month we have a ‘fan the fire’ service which is much more relaxed with a lot more time for prayer and worship and they really encourage people to come up with stuff and I’ve done it got up and said something once before at this service.  But tonight during worship we sang this song about how great God, how he is awesome. And I was struggling to sing it. Not because I didn’t believe it at that moment but because I just felt for lots of people who like I have often, weren’t feeling that at the moment. And then we went on to sing another one ‘Power of your love’ and it has good words about where we want to be, not necessarily where we are, what we want to be like, not necessarily how we are currently. And it has the line ‘and I will soar on eagles wings’ and it suddenly reminded me of Isaiah 40:28-31   “The Lord is the everlasting God, the creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no-one can fathom.  He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak. Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall; but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint”     And I just really felt God saying that he understands.  We can’t understand how he understands but he does.  He doesn’t get fed up of us, he won’t give up on us. He will not grow tired or weary with us.  And he knows that at the moment we may not feel like praising him, we may not feel thankful, we may feel tired, weary, burdened and generally crap but there will come a day when we will run, we will not be faint, we will be renewed, we will soar like an eagle, we will be able to look down and see God’s perspective and see that although when we were in it, it didn’t make sense, from this view up above, from God’s view, it does.  And just the encouragement from those verses that it will come one day. We may want it now, we may not understand why it doesn’t happen now, but if we hope in God, if we continue trusting him even though it is SO hard, he will renew us.     And I felt stupid, and the whole why would God possibly speak to me?, wouldn’t he use someone far better, far more important, what can I possibly have to say that is of any benefit to anyone else? but I found myself going up and telling Tamsin who was leading the service. And she said that she thought it was good, it was true and so after the worship she went up and said that someone had come up and said this.  And anyway I was still thinking, what if it was just me, what if I made it all up, what was I doing going up there and thinking I could possibly say something useful, maybe I just wanted to look good.  But then Rob got up to preach and he started off by referring to the passage I had said.  And how Paul (was talking about 2 Tim 4:1-8) knew what it was like to be waiting for something, waiting for God’s promises to be fulfilled, how he had to hope in the Lord and wait to be renewed and how that could give us hope too. So maybe it was right? Or maybe I’m just a freak (far more likely!)  Ok and I have been ‘real’ with 2 people today. Yipee! And neither of them turned around and hit me, or said they hated me (although they could have been thinking it). So experiment is working so far!
