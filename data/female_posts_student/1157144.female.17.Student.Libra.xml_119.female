Marissa and Dave broke up today, well actually Dave dumped Marissa because he needs his "space and time to think."  Thats the BIGGEST LOAD OF SHIT I'VE EVER HEARD if you ask me!!!  So, tomorrow if you see him in the halls or even talk to him, give him a big, mean, nasty look or kick him in the croch.  Thanks!
