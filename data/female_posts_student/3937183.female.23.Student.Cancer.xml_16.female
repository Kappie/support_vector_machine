Anyway, he uncovered the truth while reading my blog. WoooooOoooOooOOooo, I slapped myself real hard on my own face ya? AKKAKAKAK! Still, he was cool and told me that I need not lie to him at all. If I do not want to see him, he will not appear in front of me and if he happened to be at where I was, he would leave immediately… WHAT A FUCKING SWEET BOYFRIEND I HAVE! He always never fails to make me smile like a baby.    This blog was initially started with a thought in mind, just me and myself should read but now I’ve given 3 persons the honor to read too. Yvonne, SUGARFLY and moi darling. I enjoy reading people blogs and as for my own blog, it was meant as a future reference. Like maybe months later when I want to know what I had done for that particular day, I could actually retrieve this information just by 1 click. Darling only got to know about my blog address today but said he'll never read my blog again because he don’t want me to lie to my own blog and he feels that he should respect my privacy… Well, sometimes, I think he is really mature for a 23 years old, compared to those monkeys that I had known for years! Should I change my blog title to “A Tribute To My Friends”? Kakakkakakakkakak!    Went to catch Harry Potter 3 with Yvonne and SF today. It was a disappointment like what SF had mentioned, NO PLOTS! Ya… Why is it not as good as the first 2 man? Hiak! After the show we went to ALIF for prata and then proceed to SFs’ home which is just mins of walk away. I was feeling a little reluctant initially because I was so warm and uncomfortable. Still, I was thinking no harm going up for just a quarter hour or so. Guess what, power failure again! It’s like WTF!!!!! Why always power failure at the wrong time? I was feeling so warm and now, warmer! I couldn’t stay on man. It was really too warm liao and so I decided to get a cab home immediately. I went off and started dialing my darlings’ nos but the damn bloody fucking network is down… I panicked as I started imaging things happening to my dear boy. He is a cop and I am constantly worried of his well being. I called him for at least 20 times on my way home and decided to leave him SMS instead since it’s simply impossible to get him at all…    Went into shower as soon as I settled down. I wanted to cool myself and also I wanted to make it a fast one so darling can have me for the rest of the night. Oh, school is starting next week man… The thought of it causes nausea… I think I got addicted to this kinda slacking lifestyle man! WAHAHAHHAH! Now to the people reading my blog, cheers for friendship and cheers for opening up to one another. Love ya guys.    Kisskiss!
