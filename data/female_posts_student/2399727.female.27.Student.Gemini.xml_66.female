Supposed to hear M.L. and possibly A.E. speak, directing and designing  Die Walkuere .  I should bring a good question in case I ever got a chance to ask a question to the latter fellow besides, "Are you really so busy you can't spare me 10 minutes for an interview between now and 2007?!"  More to come...
