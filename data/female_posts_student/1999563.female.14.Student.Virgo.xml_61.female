We sat in the sleeper section. Its the funniest thing ever.  All that REALLY tired people sit in the back left corner.  5 people in the row next to us fell asleep. It was funny. I laughed. I was soooooooooooo tired, I almost fell asleep to! It must be the air over there.....  Sunshine wasn't there. My life is curently very cloudy. It kinda sucks...hahhaha... Life *inhales vigorously* hahahhaha get it? as in sucks? Hahha...ok never mind. Sometimes people just don't understand. Sometimes i think I am the only one who gets anything about myself at all. Like on Thrusday night when I almost got eaten by a cougar...nobody understood that. They were like "What...?"  Well...sinca ya'll are probably curious by tnow I will tell the story.  I was studying for this stupid spanish test and i was having a super horrible day. It was about 8:30 at night. The best thing to do on days like that is to go alone and cry + think. Considering there is NOWHERE to go in my house where you will be alone I deicded to "run away" So I ran and ran until I couldn't run anymore and I sat on the ground and just cried. It was quite depressing.  All one the sudden this huge thing jumps up out at me. I was sooo stinkin' scared that I started to sprint super fast home. It  chased my all the way. I ran into my house. I leaned against the wall a breathed in. I was finally safe! I then noticed my whole body was shacking and the tears were still pouring. Then all my dad came running and he was like "Are you ok???"  So I sat down and ate a ton of fruit snacks. It helped a lot. I got an ok grade on my test. It was aa miracle. Thank goodness for  cougars.  Random Thoughts!  CAM's mascot is a cougar..... Ridgefield is finally winning football games   My friend goes to ridgefield She went to homecoming with a BOY (oooooh! "I can't beileve her parents are letting her" Hahha....thats what my mom said *sigh* *rolls eyes*) I am going to attempt to sew my dress for Winter Formal. The pattern is absolutely gorgeous. I will look awesomely gorgeous. If I learn to sew. Gosh, cheese is good.   I found this poem on the internet and I absolutely love it so I thought I would share it with ya'll  It's Not Easy (Being Me) By: Joyesse  Don't come too close,  Please stay at bay,  For you won't like what you see.  The facade so quickly fades away,  It's not easy being me.  Hidden behind a counterfeit smile,  A peevish personality,  Is lurking till the smallest trial Brings out the worst in me.  Like a bomb assembled to ignite Or a fault beneath the sea,  Is an ever raging, brewing fight Alive inside of me.  Released then swallowed by remorse,  Guilt with perplexity.  Is there redemption, help, recourse,  For a sinner such as me?  Then my eyes are turned to another land Fixed on a center tree.  And the blood which pours from two outstretched hands,  Offer hope and forgiveness to me.  So come if you will, but please look away From my faults - for many there be!  When the work He's began is complete on "that day" I will be whole, I will be free   And it will be easier...  Later ya'll!  Goodbye with love and cheese-  Laura
