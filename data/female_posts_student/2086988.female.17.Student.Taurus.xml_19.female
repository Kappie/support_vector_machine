But, I'll post them, they're ok, one's really depressive and sad, the other is happy is a sense. And they're both personal, so yeah.  "scars" I cut to take away the pain The ebbing emotional pain that would never cease Now, instead of pain, I have the scars Each day, I look at them, Remembering the nights I would play with my razor blade... To feel the release the crimson blood brought And now as I sit on my bed, I can remember each scar and what they represent I live the pain over again My scars, Will they ever go away?  "waiting" Anticipation is building I wish it was that day already, The day I can be with you Until then I wait Hoping as each day passes, It brings me closer to you Somedays are harder than others But, I know in my heart,  That day will come, Where I can hold you in my arms, look in your eyes, And say, I love you  I guess, for some reason I'm depressed tonight, which is weird considering I don't think anything is wrong...the only reason I say this is because that urge to cut came back, thus why I wrote "scars", BUT WHY :(... like I don't have enough cuts on my wrists as it is...   My soul cries for deliverance
