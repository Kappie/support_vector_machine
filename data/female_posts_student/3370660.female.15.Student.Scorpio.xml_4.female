She was only part of my life for a few weeks, but I never said goodbye.  The month of March was too pleasant, too exciting, too wonderful. Lack of it makes this summer look even worse.  Damnit, Katie had better let me live with them this summer.  I wish Vineet knew just how pathetic I've become- I wish I had the guts to tell him.   Oh, all that I know, theres nothing here to run from Coz yeah, everybody heres got somebody to lean on    Current music:  Beautiful World | Coldplay
