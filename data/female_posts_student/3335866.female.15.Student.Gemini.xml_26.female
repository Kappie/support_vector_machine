I have several hundred things clamoring for my attention at the moment, and I can't seem to go along with any of them. So, basically, I'm half-assing all my dozens of responsibilities. They range from unimportant (returning Netflix DVDs) to everyday urgent (the gym, working with my dad, et cetera). And then there's also preserving relationships (going to the beach with my mom after having not seen her in a while; making up with Henna after several stupid fight-things), and creating a bank account for the over $300 in checks currently stashed in my room, and signing up for the free college course I'll soon be ineligible for, and going to the doc to figure out whether the huge bug-bite-induced rash on my arm is dangerous, and arranging when to go to my grandparents house, and flossing my teeth before bed, and washing the dishes, and going to the movies with someone I like, and learning to drive.  God! Normally I get to micromanage any event in my life, but this (though it might not seem it to the untrained eye) is so much that everything is slipping past me. I haven't had a chance to go to the gym once this week. Both my parents and grandparents want me to go on vacation with them, and I haven't even started summer reading. I  wish  I was unoccupied enough to rot my brain out with Ellen, and the good Dr. P. I miss boredom.  I saw  The Village  the other day. The movie was slightly creepy, kind of stupid, and generally forgettable. The company, however, was not. I went along with Natalia and two of her friends, which included the BIL (boy I like). Gentle reader, I can tell you that during the car ride to the theater I thought that I was going to barf. My vivid imagination conjured images of my babbling on, my saying nothing, my walking weird, my ducking my head when he turned after I'd been staring at him weirdly. I mean, come on! I'm (real name undisclosed)! The girl that I am does not actually spend time with the people she crushes on. My real person isn't busy, or social, or whatever. It's so weird. I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone. There have been fundamental changes within myself, and suddenly I'm a different person, but I expect myself to be the same. Does this make any sense? I just feel so weird. There's no time to obsess over little bizarre nothings I used to make up to agonize over.  Anyway, when I was going to the movie I was all messed up. Natalia had very little tolerance for this, and pointed out that this wasn't a date, I was just going along with her while she saw her friends. And she was right. I came into the event with a certain view of things. Everything was about the BIL. The BIL! Ohmygod, I was going to see the BIL. If I hadn't been thinking like that, though, I would just have felt that I had a kick-ass time. If I think of things without the crush complicating it, then it seems that I had a wonderful time with one of my best friends and two of her incredibly funny acquaintances. I had a much better time than I would have with almost anyone else, and I told N. as much. Does this make any sense?  So, to sum up my weird-ass ramblings, I saw a movie with someone I like. He was quiet, a little, and so was I. We wore the same thing, weirdly, although his shoes were sneakers (I think), not girly sandals. Duh. All of us took turns snarking, or saying random things, or listening to the others speak. After the movie was over the four of us stayed after everyone else left. It is in fact possible to make handpuppet shows on the movie screen. It's also quite fun to laugh at the movie or laugh at the ads on the screen. Dude?- that movie pretty much sucked. Don't see it. Although, I might be biased. Through the entire second half I knew exactly how it was going to end, thanks to an unwelcome hint from Henna. That whole thing sparked one of the fights between us, but whatever.  Currently reading:  The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  by Douglas Adams. Have you ever heard of the  Hitchhiker's Guide  books? It's one of those. In places it's boring enough to make me want to drop it, but then a laugh-out-loud moment comes along and I remember why I like these books. In one part, the entire ship goes out of order during a Vogon attack because it (the ship) is trying to make a cup of tea. That, my friend, is fan-frickin'-tastic.  Currently watching:  Days of our Lives . Yes, I am once again hooked. Damn you, Sami and Lucas! I have an on-again, off-again relationship with this show, much like the one I have with Cheerios. I like it intensely for short periods of time, and then its natural idiocy asserts itself and I drop it once more. Then, an intriguing scene on one of my mom's tapes will catch my eye... and so on. And for the observant, I didn't contradict myself. I'm able to watch DOOL through the magic of the VCR, not through my sloth and empty lifestyle.  Currently surfing:  urlLink glarkware . My new job-induced 'wealth' is burning a hole in my pocket, and  urlLink these  and  urlLink this  are my new obsession. There are visions of button-earrings dancing in my head. And  urlLink these  shoes. They were in  Seventeen  and really looked way nicer there; this picture doesn't do them justice. I need them. I want them. I have no dress shoes. This isn't a figure of speech; I really have none except one pair of practical clunky ones my grandmother bought me. No offense, but these are on a whole other level. And God! In the tub! What incomprehensible genius! I need to go to bed now.  I'm probably going to be in Massachusetts tomorrow, so I won't post for at least a few days. Good night. Sleep tight. Don't let the monsters bite. Unless you're into that, in which case, go for it. See y'all later.
