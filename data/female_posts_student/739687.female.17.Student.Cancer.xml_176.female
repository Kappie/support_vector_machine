Had  another  weird dream last night. Only last night was definately the strangest of the past three nights. Because it didn't make sense. Nothing fit together. I was at one place, then the other, then the other, and so on. All this stuff was happening and it just got so jumbled together.  Hoping today is a good day.  Wishing for great things to happen.  Dreaming of even greater things.  Mmmk, I'm outta here. Laters crazies.
