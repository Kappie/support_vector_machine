And coincedentally by them not understanding, it sounds rather morbid.    I have it narrowed down to two.   They_Call_Me_Eddy@hotmail.com (OR) Toll_Free@hotmail.com  E-mail me at beatngu14@hotmail.com with your votes.  [Any other suggestions are welcome as well!]   ****Yes, "They call me Eddy" is in reference to the song Grade Nine by Bare Naked Ladies.****
