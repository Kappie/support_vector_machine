I "forgot" to tell my parents that I didn't have the lesson, so I had an hour and a half of freedom. I was thinking of calling someone and doing something, but instead I just drove around Del Mar and up the 101 for an hour. I'm completely refreshed. It was nice and rainy and clean. It's strange, though, this is the first time I've realized how many songs say the word "rain" in them. I was listening to a CD with 16 songs on it, and 13 of them mentioned rain. So I guess it was fitting. I love having occasional alone time. Never get it at home. I'm in a really good mood right now...I'm gonna ride the wave and go read or something in my room. :)
