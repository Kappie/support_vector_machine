My brother is in hospital cause he's got appendicitis, my aunty's got cancer, so's my Grandpa and I've got a lot of stress about exams and everything. Actually... good excuses to go mad aye? Well... I was thinking about putting psychosis down on a form the other day as 'medical information' because I never put anything which is really boring! And hey, I need to be different! Err... sorry tv, as much as I love five hour old movies I think I'll have to miss this one. Geez... it's like lemmings! Loads of people/little green blobs running around and being stupid. Oooh... good thing for exam stress / lack of knowledge about who you are - Lifehouse. Yeay! Mmm... I think I might go sniff some glue :P
