Some sites have actually been here since February, just not linked to on the index page. I have more content to add over the next month or so, projects and such as time allows.  Random happiness note? 2 boxes of strawberry Pocky in my drawer at work yesterday from my cousin (he went to Atlanta the other day which is the closest place to here that carries it that I know of). One was even the Hello Kitty kind...eee! XD
