With assignments due, and Yearbook deadlines fast approaching I hardly saw today go by. I had a quick recap figuring out what homework I needed to bring home though.  It didn't fit in my back pack.  I love it when I have that much homework.  Score all weekend to research and solve, and figure.  I love these kind of weekends.  Oh wait my sacrcasm switched on again, I really need to get that fixed.     In other news I went to the soft ball game, and had fun playing with my telephoto.  I hope I got some good ones of Lola and Xola.  They also so celebrated their first season victory.  Go softball! Lola, Wren and I are going over to Great Spoons tomorrow to film a segment on thrifting for HOSD (our school news program).  It should be fun, and hopefully informative.  See you all later.
