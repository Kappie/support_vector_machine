Or pretend that they do. Either way, they're pretty fucking charming. One of them announced that he was glad that whole milk existed and that he would masturbate while thinking about my singing. I'm summarizing his comments, which I think were probably delivered a bit better than I've done here, but yes, rock on. I'm sure it was part of the image. As much time as I have devoted to transcribing this bit of information, this was not the charming part. This was: "Young miss, it's been a pleasure meeting you. I really enjoyed your performance, you should definitely keep away from that Morrissey stuff from now on. I bought you a shot. You wanna taste my drink too?" Ok. So I am easily charmed.  Everyone sang a little bit. I was even impressed by a drunk graduate student rendition of some Eminem song. Atlblingbling, in usual fashion, sang a brilliant INXS - Mystify? I am going to miss hanging out with her. Her sister came into town and when she sang "My boy lollipop", I had to gush over the cuteness.  Forgive me if the details are blur - it was a long night.  So fast-forward to three in the morning. BIB gets the wine bottle open! I've been trying to open my discount bottle of wine for days! No fear... I didn't drink more than a sip because I was feeling the effects of the "shot" and some pretty poorly made margaritas. Correction: I am still feeling the effects of the shot and some pretty poorly made margaritas.  I guess I'll have to work it out with my packing and cleaning.  I hope atlblingbling was able to get up this morning for work. Aaaaaah.
