Im like fuckng tired all these night. What am I gonna do next? Should I go for red rain concert or not? I hadn't done anything constructive to my studies. This is hell. Holy shit. Someone give me time and motivation! This is all I need. God, help me pls. Im utterly bored here. Narene is off to her Mt. Ophir. Leqi is banding everyday. The rest are busy. Some are nerds. While Im rotting my butt here. This whole entry is crap. If u reaslised it by now. Ha. Im insane. Totally. Anyone out there want to go study together? I need someone to study with me 24/7 before I get retained and fluck my O's, which is higly possible, at the rate Im doin my work now.  Towning anyone? Movies? Clubbing? Pool? .... Study?
