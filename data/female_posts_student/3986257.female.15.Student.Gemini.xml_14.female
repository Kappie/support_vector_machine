     
      Stiff as a board You lay there, unaware Sleeping soundly but not snoring And I kind of miss that about you.  Flowers seem to poke out of nowhere In their glory presented to you But do you notice, do you care? Because all I wish is that you were here.  You were always a piece of string hanging in the air Not sure where to go or what the hell to do But you always bowed and smiled so humbly And my hearts mind is flooded with the grief Of having to finally let go of you.  I hope you're happy when no one else is You deserve it, you really do. And I hope you got all that you asked for up there And tell God I'm waiting, too.  So you're stiff as ice up on that altar But you see, you're slowly melting... You're going into that place where we all dream We could go without pain.
