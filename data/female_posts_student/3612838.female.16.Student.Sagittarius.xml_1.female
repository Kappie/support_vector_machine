Find out the best way to be of service today and your problems will eventually take care of themselves"       My say:   Ok so if i suffered depression in my life, it must have been due to so much self centeredness. Now if i begin to think less of myself and more of others,I realize life would be a lot more exciting and challenging! ;) Yeah, life's always fun when you're with somebody...haha, take it from me, I'm a certified introvert gal but then it just seems so different when you're helping out and you're living your life with a company. Believe me, its always good
