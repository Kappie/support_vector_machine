We finished an entire bottle of kettleone among 6 people all in cosmopolitans, plus wine. I haven't been that drunk in quite a while, but I somehow managed to avoid the hangover. It must have been the massive amount of coffee and breakfast I had this morning. Tried to get some reading done this morning, but I wan't too successful, even though I have two papers due next week and need to get to work on so I'm not completely screwed. I also need to catch up on Elsa Morante, I'm like 200 pages behind and need to read at least 400 to finish the book. At least it's a good book, but it can be depressing to make so little progress when I actually open it up. Oh well. Best intentions for a productive weekend!
