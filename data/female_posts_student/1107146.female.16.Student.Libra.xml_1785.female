So if anyone would like to see me bust my ass/head on solid concrete, come to the B Hall before school! You can't miss us! I'll be the one screaming at the top of my lungs (like I do every morning) with long hair and an EMO kid, marijuana-like-induced, drawl!   Yeepin, tomorrow is going to pwn azz0r. And as for Abby...I'M SORRY! I shouldn't be talking about cool slacker stuff for those of us who aren't going to be in on it. In her stead and defense, "nobody posts anything relevent on here".  DI, w00t. When are we starting?   And   That   Is   All   Man, I'm really abusing my HTML privlidges and I have no life whatsoever. I just got back from running so I feel like I can move at about nine million miles an hour, which I am, in fact, doing as I type this post, at only a slightly decelerated rate.  Adieu, mes amis.
