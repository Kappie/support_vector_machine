Later I remember desperately trying to reach out and throw something from my bed, and SOMETHING GRABBED MY WRIST!  I screamed and instantly woke up, or at least was able to move.  The first person I mentioned this to was my New-Age buddy Yvonne at work.  She said, as if this was the most normal thing in the world, "Oh, that was just your spirit entering your body.  That's why you couldn't move.  They leave and roam around at night."  Apparently I grabbed my own wrist but since the spirit was AWOL, my sense of touch was impaired.  Maybe telling her wasn't such a great idea after all.  She also told me something about the Venus eclipse and how my powers of telepathy are going to be increased in the coming weeks.  Great.  Now I won't just be thinking that people are talking behind my back--I'll know it!!  :)
