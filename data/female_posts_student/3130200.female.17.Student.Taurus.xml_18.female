If it weren't 2:16 in the AM I would go satisfy my craving, but I can't and I'm pissed because I want me some egg rolls and Kung Pao Beef NOW! Hell.  I had the most exciting day, oh wait I must be confusing my life with someone else's again. Sorry about that. Actually, the day wasn't too bad. Went to the lake, rode some jet skis, sat in a chair on the beach, forgot the sunscreen, have weird sunburn on back of hand. Might take picture of it and post it tomorrow.  I love my dogs more than I love most people. I think it is so cool that Caly's only job in the entire world is to hang out with my other dog, Zeus. Zeus and Caly are what psychologists mean when they talk about unconditional love. I mean, I will go outside for literally less than a minute yet when I walk back in the house they are ecstatic to see me, like it has been a lifetime since I left them. They're always at my foot or hand, waiting to be petted and stroked, played with and talked to. Zeus' huge blocky head and his overgrown puppy body. Caly's paw scratching at you and her ears perked up to hang on your every word. Even though I am sure they don't, it seems like the understand me in ways no human ever could. They keep me company when I'm watching TV, they protect me from the UPS man, they scare away the airplanes by howling at them, and they are forever my afternoon nap buddies. I can honestly say that I wish I was more like my dogs, providing unbridled love and unconditional friendship to whoever gives them a good belly scratch.
