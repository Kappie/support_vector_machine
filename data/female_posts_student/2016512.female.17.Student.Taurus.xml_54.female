I'm liking dance a lot. it's fun and i actually get some attention this year. i'm normally in the back and don't get noticed except when i'm doing something wrong. the one thing is i'd like to get my leg higher. why won't it go any higher i mean i'm working harder but it just won't budge.  one act - that's alright. my parts kind of fun. all 6 lines of it. i'm not really liking the atmosphere. all the jabbering is getting old. it seems like no ones trying. i don't want to win...i want to be done  KB - well that's alright. i like the practices except when we have an english lesson. and surprisingly enough we haven't done the buzzer practice. boo that. i think we'll do alright this year. we have a lot of new people. you can tell they are new by the way they buzz and their confused looks. haha it's kind of funny. Trixie is kind of annoying me. i mean i know she's just doing what she wants to, but it feels like she's trying to be me by being in one act and KB. i know i'm totally wrong about that, but i just get a wierd vibe when i'm around her.  yesterday i had my first free saturday in a month. it felt so good. i went shopping with Tatyana. we had a grand time. i got a lot of stuff. sadly the camera i want is way to expensive so hopefully i can save up for that by may. i want the whole sha bang. with manual focus and lenses. i'm shooting for a nice one around 200 at a pawn shop, including all the accessories. but other than that i got all the things on my shopping list plus a cd. i think i'm going to start my book today i hope i like it. it's called "Amerika" by Kafka.  We have contact, -Betso
