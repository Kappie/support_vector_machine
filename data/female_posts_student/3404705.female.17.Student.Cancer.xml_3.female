Very ironic, how the big things, big problems I can handle myself and get through them, but when it comes to the small things, I get nervous.  Like the United vs Millwall FA Cup Final match. It's so silly. "Not the end of the world," a friend said. Well, true. And yet... I cant figure out why. So idiotic of me...  Aniway. I went to school today, to fecth my monkeys. On the way, in the bus, I saw a group of Maarifians, taking pictures, about say 6,7 of them, at the busstop. In front of Tanjong Katong Complex. The first thought was, "What the... No other place to take photo isit??" But then i laughed to myself... Cause it brought back so many memories...  I have lots of memories of school. Those were the days. I got into trouble, played around, fooled around, caught in a few tricks, got away with some. And all the things that I have done, i cannot sincerely say that I regret them. Everyday at school, is a lesson. Not just educational, but moral lessons, life lessons.  There's a saying that goes: A school is a building of four walls and tomorrow inside. For me, it rings true, because not only does my school provide me with the necessities on Earth, but also in the Hereafter, and I can't be thankful enough...  School, Ma'arif, is also the place where i found my Friends. I hold on to the idea that there are 5 types of Friends: Just~, Good~, Close~, True~ and False~. I found all five in Ma'arif.  My sister once asked, where would i want to go, if I werent already in Maarif, and it brought a smile to my face, because my mind went blank. I dont know, truthfully. My heart is so binded with Maarif that other Madrasahs are never an option for me. I never dreamt of being in another madrasah, and never will.   I am a Maarifian, through and through.  How funny, considering that just five months ago, my decision not to stay at Maarif is because Im tired of it.  Well. So proves the sayings: "So ironic how I had to lose just to see." "You don't know what you've got till it's gone." "You don't miss the water till the well runs dry..."  Peace  PS/ To the present Maarifians out there: Savour every moment you're there, be thankful for everyday... Take my word for it :)
