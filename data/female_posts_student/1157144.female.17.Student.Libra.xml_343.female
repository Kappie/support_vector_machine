I am psyched for our booth as well; i like dealing with unfamiliar people and drawing on their skin... unless it is nasty-ass acne all over and pothole skin... *koff koff* ANYWAY, I'll meet up with whoever at the carnival; I have a hair appointment at 9 or so anyway, so I won't get there until some time after 10, but yea. Grr I still wish the pie-ing thing was available. You know, if we get there and they AREN'T doing that, I am going to be pissed off cause that would have been so awesome. Hehehehe, Jason, you would look good with pie on your face, it could be your original fashion statement. Heheh.  Billy- As far as dresses go, yea, it's just one of those superficial things to converse about that we all have in common. And of course you dont want to have the same dress. Also-- we went dress shopping and stuff together to get opinions about it... for instance, on a night when EVERYONE will probably look great, it is in the air to make yourself look your best, too. I personally can't tell when things look "just ok" or "pretty good" because my view is always warped. A second opinion is always nice.  And... you gotta admit, it is in most girls' nature to discuss clothes I suppose. I know it is silly, but ... I openly admit I am superficial like that.  By the way, no one was offended, I don't think. And neither am i. =)
