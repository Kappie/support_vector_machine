I woke up this morning at 6:30 am!!! yeah buddy...I got to volunteer for McKinney's Make a Difference Day, we made crafts for the meals on wheels program, I sware if I have to color any more bunnies or make any more turkeys...lol. So I worked from about 8am-12 pm, yay I got 4 hours for National Honor Society :). After that me and Kiera went to Starbucks of course because I was like dead, mmmm caffine...Then we went to Plano and went to Collin Creek Mall and met up with my fave whores Embry and Emily!!! We tried on Winter Ball dresses. So many cute ones...too bad the person I wanna go with can't probably go with me, let alone see me in my dress :(. I don't know if I want a black and white one or a red one. I might wait until Prom for the red one. Since Collin Creek didn't have alot of good dress stores, we drove to Frisco to go to Stonebriar Mall. There I found my dress. Omg, it is so pretty, black in the middle with white sides. I looked so great in it, my figure looked so good, ahh I love my curves ^_^! David I wish you could of seen me in it... Too bad the dress was $337, though money's not really an issue, but that's what you'd probably want to spend on prom, not the winter ball. There was a red one with the sides cut out that I liked, I'll probably get that one. All I bought today was 2 thongs, lol. One had cherries on it, come on y'all know I love cherries! And I got this really cute black and pink one that laced and tied at the hips, it is sooooo CUTE, haha there's only one person that's ever going to see me in it ;), those are my "special thongs". Too bad I ran out of money, because I saw these lacy boy shorts that were black with a cursive pink "D" on them, Embry was like omg you need to get these to wear for David, lol. Might have to go back and get those...;)  I haven't been home since about 7 am and it's now like almost 11 pm, lol. If I wasn't so dead tired I would stay up and watch SNL, but I'm about to fall over and why is it so FREAKING COLD HERE!!! BRRRR!!! Stupid Texas...   All of your friends think I'm just too young for you So tell them, that I can do things girls their age can do Let me love you down, even If It takes all night
