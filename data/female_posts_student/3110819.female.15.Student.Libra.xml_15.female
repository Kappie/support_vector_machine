I used to listen to her, but then her songs started to annoy me (too many poppy happy ballads). I just saw here on t.v. though, and her knew stuff isn't bad. may have to check her out.  I am so incredibly sore. I lifted quite a bit in p.e. yesterday, and then we did a lot of stretching drills in taekwondo last night. I can live with that though. the only thing that annoyed me last night was the fact I couldn't get my jump ax break. I went through perfectly last class! arghh. but we may have some new recruits. these juniors that go to my school. one of them is waaay hot. wonder if they'll join.  tgif. exept the fact I have to play at the graduation tonight (way too hot to play!) the weekend is great. I can't believe that this was my last friday as a freshman. it's crazy, the year just flew by.   I may also be starting a just photo blog. I'll keep ya posted.   later.
