Maren was coming in at 5 so I could get off the register for my last hour and do the put-backs.  At about 430PM I was alone at the register while Heather was in the foyer.  She was looking out the front door while trying to put up a sign.  She turns around and goes to me, "there's a clown in a wheelchair in the parking lot".  I just looked at her with that "what are you talking about" look upon my face.  I'm thinking it's one of those things when there's business and they want to promote something, they have someone dress up in an animal suit or something with the promotion.  It wasn't.  Here's how our conversation went:      Heather: There's a clown in a wheelchair in the parking lot   Me (I just have that look on my face): What?   Heather: There's a clown, in a wheelchair, in the parking lot      (At this point I leave the register (like there's anyone there anyways) and I go look out the front door).      Sure enough, there was a man (fat man might I add) in a yellow clown suit, in an electric wheelchair coming toward the store.  I wish I thought of taking my phone out earlier than I did (I have a camera phone) because when I thought of it, he was getting a little too close to the door and I didn't want him to see me take a picture of him.  Now I really regret not doing it.      Heather and I then run back to my register, and Heather tells Robyn to dial my register.  By this time, the clown was in the foyer of the store.  We can't hold back the laugher, we start laughing.  I never saw Heather laugh so hard in my life till this very moment.      Robyn calls my register.      Heather then tries to say, "there's a clown in a wheelchair in the store" but fails to do it due to laughter.  You can tell Robyn asked, "what?" through the phone because Heather tried to repeat it.  She was laughing  so  hard that she actually passed the phone to me and went "do you wanna tell her?"  I was laughing so hard myself that I couldn't so I just shook my head.  Finally Heather was able to gather herself so she could tell Robyn.        Later Robyn comes up to the register (and by now the clown is just in the store somewhere) so Heather could ring her up.  I could tell Heather was trying to talk about the clown.  And now at this time, I had customers.  I don't know why...but when I heard Heather try to explain it again to Robyn, I started laughing.  I started laughing the second I saw Robyn come toward the registers because I knew Heather would tell her.  I'm sure the two customers on my line probably thought I was crazy.  Since I was laughing at nothing, through their eyes.           People, you don't see this everyday.  You don't see a clown, in an electric wheelchair, go through the parking lot and come into your store.  You might have seen weird things...but in my 4 months of being at the Rag Shop, I never saw such a thing.  I'm still getting a kick outta it.  I'm still amused and I'm still laughing at the thought.  It was definitely funny.  Maren laughed too when I asked if she saw him when she came in.  I didn't even have to  finish  my sentence.  She did for me.  It was great.  Him coming up through the parking lot to the front door is one of those things that are scarred in ones memory for life.            No, I wasn't on drugs, nor am I on them right at this moment.  This actually happened.
