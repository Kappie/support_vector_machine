We  had  a great relationship, we were going togeather fora year, at that time it was my  longest  relationship with a guy, and I thought i had it all. But I gusss  i was wrong . It shows us that when we are young, we dont know what true  love  is. We shouldnt even let thoes deadly words roll off our tongues " I love you ." Because we dont mean it. We thought we did, but we dont. Dont make the same mistake that I have done many times and just give your heart away. I am happy to say my heart is safe now, It has a good home...
