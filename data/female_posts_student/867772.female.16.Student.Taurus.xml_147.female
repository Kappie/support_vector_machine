In my Mom's case, that point would be her entire life until college. Anyway... of course, my parents raised me and my brothers as catholics, taking us to church every sunday and holiday, and ensuring our reception of first communion.  I guess that all kind of fell apart when my parents' marriage did. We still attended church, but only on special occasions. After a couple years, we stopped going altogether.  But, in the past six months or so, I've begun to become increasingly interested in religion again. The only problem is, I've decided that I don't particularly like Catholicism. Watch Stigmata. That's kind of how I feel, only a tad bit less extreme. I'm still kind of confused.  I go to The Root every once in a while, which is a religious group that meets once weekly after school. I have some good friends who are avid participants. Really frickin awesome kids. A couple of them, who attend a Protestant church, invited me to go with them, and i went a couple of times. It felt really good to be involved with religion again, but I still wasn't sure if that was the path I wanted to be on. So I tried the UU church with Mom. Very, very interesting. But definitely not what I'm looking for. So, I kind of stopped going to church for a few weeks because I didn't know where I wanted to go, and I didn't have anyone to go church-taste-testing with, because my mom started working again.  Then: the rally. The kids from The Root put together a Christian rally, and had bands play, kids tell their stories, and an evangelist change people's lives. I'll admit it, during his  little  speech, some things he mentioned hit so close to home that I started to cry. At the end, he had kids come up to the stage who weren't "right with God". I'll let you define that for yourself. I went up. It was really cool, because all the kids at the stage were kind of proclaiming in front of everyone the fact that they were going to try to live their lives for God from that point on. There was such a sense of spiritual unity. Plus, it was just fun :)  So, I'm going back to my Protestant friends' church again. I went tonight, for the Good Friday service, and I'm going for Easter, and hopefully the sunday following that, and the one following that, and the one following that....  I'm still not sure if this is exactly where I want to be, but I really do like it, and I love my friends for being so inviting and helpful.  God rocks.
