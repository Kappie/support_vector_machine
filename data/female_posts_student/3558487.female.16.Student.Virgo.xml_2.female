I didn't really know what to do, i dun wanna pretend like i'm a teacher or anything, cuz obviously i'm not, so i just give them tips that i know. They seem to be doing a good job, i'm excited! The squad leaders still kinda treat me like i'm stupid, and i'm like yes i do know what i'm doing, thanks.   After that, my dad was trying to figure out camera lighting and stuff w/ james so they took lots of pictures of me. I didn't smile for half of them, it gets boring after a while.   Then i went shopping at the grocery store. This butcher man kept telling me that the meat was in the back of the store and asking me if i got any meat yet. It was kinda funny. I also found Aero bars from Europe at Kroger! I got two and ate them w/ my sister. It was very exciting!   Then i drove my dad to the car dealership. Finally, he has his car back, no more complaining about my driving and now i can actually listen to music in my car.   We went and visited my great grandma in the hospital after that. She's so funny, she just keeps telling all these stories and memories she has about her cats and birds. She can't really hear what we're saying to her either because of her hearing which makes it more interesting. I dunno if i wanna get old. It seems like things get worse because your hearing goes, your eyes go, she said her tastebuds were going, you get sick, can't move around as easily, and worse of all your friends/spouse die. She doesn't complain though, maybe its not so bad. I guess it just depends on how you look at things.   Those are my thoughts for tonight.
