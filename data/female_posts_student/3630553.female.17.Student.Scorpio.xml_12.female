Well, not  yet . Let's simply hope for the better...and that is for the Maroons not to end up last on the UAAP67th season overall ranking.  I've watched two games of UP against OTHERS in hopes for a single victory. Unfortunately, tough luck hit other colors over maroons. But that's OK, we have a mighty PEP Squad, anyway. (I must admit that on times like these, it's always better to look on the bright side of things). I'm sure you'd all agree, won't you?  Anyways, the competition has just started. There’s more to come and chances are still big. Hopefully, the first match we’ve had with the "others" would not be the preview of our overall performance for the whole season.  Oh, well. Let's just cheer some more, shall we?  "SHOOT THAT BALL!"
