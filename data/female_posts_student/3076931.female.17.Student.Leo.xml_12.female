That yearbook's my baby. I really like the spreads i designed...and i may try out to be an editor next year..hmmm...... Now I get to stress out about AP bio. woohooo.   My weekend was grand! I got to see Lisa! I LOVE LISA! It made me feel like old times. We reminisced about 6th grade and old times.  It's always the same when we hang out. I never feel weird around her and that is awesome.  I'm glad that we can go without seeing eachother for like 2 years, but then see eachother again and be the same as we were in 6th grade.   It's so odd that it's Monday and i'm in such a giddy mood. Maybe it's the weather. Maybe it's the whole yearbook thing. Or maybe i'm just weird.  It's one of those. I should be like stressed out over school and college and shit.      Oh yeah...the shitty four letter word...prom.  Oh well.  I really want to go with a guy that i like, but yeah i don't like any one, so that could be a problem.  It really sucks.  I already returned my dress cuz i figuired i'm not going to be going anyways. I've just talked myself into that.  I'm preparing myself for prom night.  Me,Myself and I.  It would be awesome if someone asked..but that is not going to happen.  It's okay. I'm a better person than that.  I shouldn't let stupid things like prom upset me right? I guess some people deserve to go more than i do.. i dunno. It's okay.  I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go. I'll just keep telling myself that.  My parents will be out of town..so maybe i could just hit up the liquor and get drunk off my ass, all by myself. Ooo i'm excited.  Oh no, look at wut i've done. The giddyness is going away....bring it back..bring back the giddyness..   haha it's funny how little things are so funny.  Megan and I will leave random 5 minute messages on eachother's phones and we FREAK out and pee in our pants about how funny we are. ( 3/8's megan hahaha)  hahaha i love little stupid things. Without them..i would be upset about stupid things..like prom. BAH! ohhhh nooo..i also need a date for presentation..bah. guys have it sooo easy.    i think i'm gonna go outside and wash my car. and play with chalk. and eat. eating is good.
