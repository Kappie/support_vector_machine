The medicine the doc man prescribed is finally working thank God. I can actually breathe through my nose again guys! Isn't that super splender-fer-ific! Yea, I thought so too.    Ok so anyways.  Life has been pretty good the past couple of days. Just saturday we went to look at the prom site again, and it was looking more awesome than ever. I also got to meet brittney and her mom, people who will hopefully be coming to the prom. I had an awesome time- and I had the most amazing salad I have ever ate in my life. It was the chicken cesar salad at Olive Garden... and.. the waiter was "mmm mmm good". Haha. Yea he was mucho caliente and I think he knew it. What was funny is.. I was trying to get his attention so I could snag some too go boxes, and so finally, I had to just stick my hand out and say "Ok, lets just stop right there for a second". It was so hilarious.     Sleep is calling to me.. I shall go answer it...
