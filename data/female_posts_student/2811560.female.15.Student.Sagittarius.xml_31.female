First, we just had a regular music rehearsal for like an hour and half and then we learned blocking which is really, really weird. This sucks because not only do I have to learn Hope's part, but I also have to learn all the chorus blocking too! I have no idea how I'm going to do it. Yeah, and I guess I have to have my lines memorized for AG the same week as my wind ensemble audition. That sucks royally. Anyways, my algebra grade is steadily falling. I have a B-. Grr, I must pull that up. I have so much shit on my plate lately. Well enough complaining. I saw contest play and GI last night, and they were so funny! Steve had to like shove these cucumber sandwiches in his mouth, and I laughed so I hard I cried. Yeah. That's pretty much it for now.
