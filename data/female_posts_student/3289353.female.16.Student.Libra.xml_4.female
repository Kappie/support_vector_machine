When i got out of 5th grade i was alittle angel i didnt do anything bad and i did all my work, but once i got to jackson people started to change the way i was they started giving me bad influence and telling me to do all this thinkgs that werent good for me.I stayed in that school and i started getting in trouble and i never did my work, they use to call my parents and i didnt even care i use to talk back to my parents always being rude to them and i always ignore them i was real bad that i started hanging around with bad people that did drugs and all that. I passed my 3yrs in that school going throught good and bad stuff.One day i got to talk to people and got tell them what had happen to me during my middle school year they gave me good advice and i decided to change i realize all the bad things i did.  People always tell me to talk to my mom about this and tell her that i regret everything i did and for me to tell her how much i love her but as much as i try doing it i cant!
