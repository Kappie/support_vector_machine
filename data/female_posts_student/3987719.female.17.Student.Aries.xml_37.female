And yes a win was in the Cards As they hit 4 homers to seal a 5-4 victory over the Cubs. In the first Edmonds got hit by Zambrano, then next time up Edmonds first pitch, put it over Waveland Ave. On the way to the dugout Zambrano yelled " Why dont run like scott rolen around the bases", After that in the bottom of the 4th Sosa stood about two feet away from the plate during his at bat and then after grounding out, carpenter said " You can step into the batters box next time, i am not going to hit you, i dont play like that". So then tempers calmed. In the top of the fifth Edgar Renteria hit a solo joband made it 3-0. Then with a collection of hits the Cubs tied the game at 3-3. The fued between Edmonds and Zambrano continued and in the 8th Carlos got his wish about Rolen running the bases as Rolen hit a 2 run homer togive the Cardsa 5-3 lead. Next up was Edmonds ,who got plunkedafter that it was so long for carlos as he was ejected. The game finished at a score of 5-4 and now the Cardinals- Cubs will play there last game against each-other for the Reg. season tomorrow.
