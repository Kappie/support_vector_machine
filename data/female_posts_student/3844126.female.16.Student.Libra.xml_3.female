HE-WH0-MUST-N0T-BE-NAMED [f0r his 0wn pr0tecti0n] was there. and when i saw him, deep inside i was like, "dang. i can d0 better than that!" hehe. am i mean? i'm n0t saying he's ugly--'cause he's n0t. there are days that he actually attracts me [else i w0uldn't have fallen s0 bad]. but n0w..he d0esn't attract me anym0re..his hair's l0ng [which i d0n't really like cause it lo0ks messy]..and well, i kinda realized that he wasn't my type after all! hehe. falling makes y0u blind. eew. ANYWAY...lo0king n0t s0 go0d actually makes it easier f0r me t0 m0ve 0n. thank y0u, mr. basili0..;D  i just f0und 0ut that there's this girl wh0's REALLY ruining my reputati0n. it sucks 'cause i KNOW i didn't d0 anything t0 her,s0 why w0uld she. i'm h0ping she gets 0ver whatever she has against me...i'm really a great pers0n 0nce y0u get t0 kn0w me..0r at least i think i am! ;D i have n0 plans 0f c0nfr0nting her ab0ut it. there's n0thing i feel guilty 0f.  i g0t h0me at 12:30am. kuya ri0 to0k me h0me.
