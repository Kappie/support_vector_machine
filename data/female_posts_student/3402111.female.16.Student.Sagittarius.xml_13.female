Suppose I saidColors change for no good reason And words will go From poetry to prose  And I, in time, will come around I always do for you  Suppose I said You're my saving grace?  -John Mayer Room for Squares "Not Myself"   I was trying to get a move on the All State etudes as they have come out!! (yikesas it was especially horrendous (spelling?) because I haven't played the E-fer in a while)when I heard this song (it was playing in the background b/c I am weird and like to have background music whileI practice). And it gave me a thought that I have been considering quite a bit today:   Are people different while they are around different people. And if they are, which one is their real self?   Liz and I talked about this today, saying that we act differently by ourselves than with a group. And I noticed that it is quite a valid point. For instance, when I am with a group I am more on the sidelines. I observe and watch everyone else. I take notes of what everyone's personality is like. But then, (and this is a new thought.... i may get a lil jumbled here, and if you get confused don't worry b/c it is likely that I will become confused as well) I am seeing how these people are in a group setting. There is a good chance that the people are different in a one-on-one situation. But anyways, I see them, and they see me. They think I am quiet and shy. But really, I normally have nothing I consider worth adding to the conversation. In actuality, I am quite the opposite. I am a fool. I make fun of myself and kid with my closer friends. I suppose I just take time to warm up to people. But once I do, I don't care what they think and go all out weird. I'll bet that they wish I hadn't warmed up to them at times.... heheh!!! Too bad for them... just kidding.... at least I hope they don't... oh well, they would let me know anyways.     But yeah, who is the real me? Who is the real you? The fun outgoing person at the parties? Or the best friend who always provides a listening ear? Or both? Hmmm..... food for thought.
