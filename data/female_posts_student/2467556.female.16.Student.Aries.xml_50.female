It was awesome!!  We did this running commentary on the facial expressions of the people in the movie, it was amusing.  For example: "that coach's eyebrows just scream communism" or "i am communist [by the way i look at you!]".  Kendra now officially claims Jimmy Craig, Nadia with Mac and Sarah with Dave Silk aka Silky.  I still got Rizzo and Brittany still has OC.  lol, going to that movie was so much fun, we have to see it again Sarah!!! Sunday: I saw "Miracle" with Brittany for what will be my 4th time because Brittany wants to catch up with me on how many times we've both seen Miracle.....lol!  I will beat you Brittany! the competition is on!!  Sports Update: Dallas beat Anaheim 4-0 tonight, brilliant play throughout the entire game.  my Niko was kickin ass!!!!  Coppell plays Grapevine this week at 6:30, i think.  I realize its finals week, but you guys, come out and support.  Look what happened when we didn't go to Euless?  They lost.....badly.   So please, let them all know that we're still here for them, even though they sucked last game......i'm going, who's with me?  My Finals Schedule:  Thursday: French 3 PreAp (i'm going to miss you Siru, Alex, Xena, Katie, Jessi!), English 2 PreAP (i'm going to miss you Cameron, Niki, Boah, Charlie, Kevin, Adam, Dana, Elizabeth!), Geometry (i'm going to miss you Cheryl, Rachel, Rajha!)  Friday: Aerobics (i'm going to miss all you guys!) and BCIS (i'm going to miss you Kate, Nathan, Luther, Matt, Freshman in the back corner!!!!)  Alright, gotta go!  Best of Luck in finals, ~~~Taylor~~~
