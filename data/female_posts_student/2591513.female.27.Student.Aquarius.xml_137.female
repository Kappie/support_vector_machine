My son is going to be a first grader...I remember being terrified of him going to Kindergarten...okay the truth comes out, I have been afraid of him going to school period.  I guess because he would no longer be under my watchful eye, what if's scared me...but alas we found a perfect school that has showered my son with nothing but love.  I will miss St. Mary's.  I wish more than anything for my son to continue on there, but alas, the distance is too far and until Ed and I can afford to live out there again, we will be unable to go there for awhile.  I say this now, but if Bailey is the least bit unappy with his new school, you know I will pull him out and put him back into St. Mary's.  I regret pulling him out of there only because I love that school...oh well, let's get through first grade.  Well I should catch some shut eye before the big day.  I hope I don't make a fool of myself and embarrass Bailey by crying...but I am so very proud of my son and the accomplishments he has done.  It is with great pride and love that I watch him graduate from kindergarten.    GO BAILEY!!
