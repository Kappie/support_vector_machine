I had such a great day today - chatting with Leah and Nick all afternoon and catching up on lost time. It was really fun, especially since my internet cafe had web cams! Yippee.   I just finished watching the last disc of "24" season one. I am so hooked on this show - it's just ridiculous.  I feel sorry for all of my friends and family because when I get home I am going to be situated on the couch watching the entire seasons I have missed. What a great show!!  Hmmm...no news here really. I talked with Lisa on the phone and she is getting siked about "THE" vacation to Bermuda. I am looking forward to it as well.  It will be so nice to lay on the beach and drink tropical drinks without having to worry about what time I have to be in uniform.  It is going to be incredible. I hear the sand is pink and Bermuda has the most gorgeous beaches in the world. I can't wait to go and hang out there. Lucky for us, we will have 3 overnights with the ship in port. We can come back to the ship as late as we want!!!  Meanwhile, I have had some very very pissed off guests calling me every five minutes on my mobile. Driving me freakin nuts! I keep wanting to tell them to **** off but every time I clam up. I guess it's a good thing that I don't tell them how I really feel. Hahaha.   Anywhooo poo poos, I am out - just wanted to send a shirt note to say hello. Smooches to all.
