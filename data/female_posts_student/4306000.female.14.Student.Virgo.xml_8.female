[no i didnt swear aloud, just typed those stuff, but i do feel freakin' angry..] anyway... the bottom line is.. it's all my father's fault.  so.. about Olympics..who're your favourites?   as i said.. i like to watch swimming.. i absolutely love U.S.A's  Michael Phelps , Australia's  Ian Thorpe   Hungary's  Laszlo Cseh .. as for female.. Australia's  Jodie Henry   Netherlands'  Inge de Bruijn ...   i also like to watch gymanstics... but... no favourites..    basketball... i love basketball... but... no favourites either.. i'm a   Vince Carter   fan, but he isn't in the U.S. Dream Team ...   i also like diving.. but no favourites (again!). the stupid China men's team (forgot which category) they had one gold guaranteed then they blew it on the last dive.. one of them got an "Incomplete Dive"... stupid nutter... being chinese i can't help hoping china will get as many as possible..  Equestrian... recently i seem to be interested in horses...i thought equestrian would be nice to watch, right? wrong! the one jumping over fences is alright.. but the one where the horse walks around in a funny manner on some field is boring! sorry, i know the way i explain is messy.. but... dunno what are the categories called.. so...    so.. what's your flava ['04 Athens Olympics]?
