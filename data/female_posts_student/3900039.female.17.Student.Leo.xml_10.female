Our mom's were teachers at the same school, so we had some contact with eachother. She thought I was a tomboy(cause I was with boys all the time...) and I thought she was a snob. In eighth grade we became friends...I don't know how, lots of mutual friends I guess, and she realized I was just a flirt and not a tomboy, ha.  She is one of the most inspiriational people I have ever met. She has stood as such a great example for me so many times. She has helped me through some of the darkest times in my life, and been there every step of the way, no matter how difficult or stubborn I got, and I can't say that for very many people. I've never found anything to complain about or get annoyed with about Carol, and you have to admit that's rare when it comes to your friends because you are with them so often you have to have the little tiny things that drive you crazy.    I love you Carol, and I know you know that I would do anything and everything possible for you if you ever needed it, but I want to say it anyway. You just flat out are a wonderful amazing human being and I can't begin to express how much I care for you and your wellbeing and happiness. I do not know where I would be with out you. You once had to tell me to hang on and that things would get better because you would make them. At the time all I needed to hear was that. So hang in there, friend, things will get better, and I will make them. I love you.     urlLink
