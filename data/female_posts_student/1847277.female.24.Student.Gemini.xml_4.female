Of course, then I'm kind of left with nothing to do.  I don't even want to know how many hours I've wasted cruising around the Net and watching cartoons (yay, Pokemon and Yugioh).  There are always emails to catch up on, but eventually that gets old, too, and in the past month (well, since I've been back from Germany), I think I've sent something like 75 messages.  And not gotten anywhere near that many in response.  But so it goes.  The fact that Matt has moved to Ohio already doesn't really help the boredom factor.  At least I've made a couple of new friends around campus, and I just found out last week that an old friend from college will be starting a PhD program at UMich this fall.  So that's fun.  Given my metamorphosis over the summer, perhaps this fall will turn out to be a rockin' good time.  Screw worrying about prelims.  Well, Stephanie will be arriving momentarily so I should get ready to go out.  Yay for not having to cook for yet another night (Matt surprised me by coming home yesterday and took me out to dinner at Cafe Zola- it was an excellent meal, albeit a little expensive...).  Tsch√ºssle!
