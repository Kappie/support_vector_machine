Now think about how rumors can effect people, gossip really sucks, but I must admit I have spread rumors once or twice, never started them.  At my school, the most popular rumor is who did what with who. Or who likes who. I have been asked numberous times if I like certain guys that I have absolutely no interest in at all.  Or I will do something with a small group of friends and I might say I like someone or that I did something with someone, and I come to school the next day and I have a million random people asking me about it. My favorite quote that one of my friends said was "Some people may believe in Adam and Eve, Some people may believe in the big bag theory, but I believe that people are full of shit." And it's true, they are.  I don't think anyone is trying to deny that though.  Well time for class, lata
