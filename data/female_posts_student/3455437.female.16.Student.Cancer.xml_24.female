If you want to see that you can go to: http://www.livejournal.com/users/jopet/     Anyways I volunteered for the salvo's today, which is cool.. so did Maya, Benita and Simona.  Oh and I wanted to apply for the world vision study tour but I didn't raise enought money. :'( I'll apply next year though.  I am getting my L's on Thursday and I got my car the other day..more good stuff. Shiva and Benji are going to come up to the land and drive it soon, my car I mean. I'm entering this graphic webdesign competition through school, if I win it will be a good thing to help me get a scholarship to uni, I wanna do an arts degree and visual design/illustration. I'm going to make the webpage by flash and hand code, which should be challenging but fun. I'm also supposed to be getting a call from this guy in Byron from some animation studio who maybe had some work for me. The guy from NBN tv station saw some of my work when I was doing work experience there and he told the animation people about me. I hope I can get a job there, I really need the cash.  It's actually supposed to be a job for ..you know, old (er) people, but he think I can do it.  Otherwise I will be doomed to work at the supermarket or somewhere equally YUCK.  btw Benji: that post just before was explaining what maya meant in less cruel words.
