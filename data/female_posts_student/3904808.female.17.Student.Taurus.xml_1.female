     
      You are a million miles away from me, Just like the distant stars above... Wish you were here and let me listen to your voice, And drive away the silence with your love...  Is it really you that I see, Or it's just a picture in my clinche? I called you a thousand times and received no replies, Tried to believe you are on the other line...  Regardless of what you do, Or where you may be found, I believe you are always beside me... Through the lush forests and meadows, Where elves and fairies dwell, I believe I will find you there...  In my deareast memories, I see you reach out to me, With your silver wings spread out with life,  Is it just my fantasy, Beyond time and reality, That will soon to be forgotten?  Regardless, I know We'll meet one day, When I go to the heavens above someday, And we'l make our dreams come through, Till I get over to you...
