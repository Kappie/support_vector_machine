But seriously *eh?* I was looking on KaZaA and no one's got it! Shock horror! Do these people not know good music when they err hear/see it? Well yeah so my choice of 'good' music might be out of societies standards but hell I'm weird! Mmm... any way I'm gonna go muck around with the parental advisory thingy. Have fun kiddies. Hey if you're bored and want to listen to scary 70's music, download 5th Dimension - Age of Aquarius and God don't ask why I have that!
