I used to hate politics so much but now, now, I cannot get my mind off this. Maybe, because of a famous actor, Arnold what's his name? Swishniger!!! I liked him as an actor for Hollywood but running for governor is so out of the question.   I don't care if people agrees to vote for him as a candidate, he is a very brilliant man but I DON'T LIKE IT. He is depending on his charm and popularity. I hope he does not win the election. Another reason is that he is republican and republican only helps the rich (higher-class) people. Has anybody ever thought about the lower class people? What is going to happen to them if a republican wins this election? I sure hope that who ever is running for democrat wins this election.    Have anyone ever thought about California? Of what is going on? Don't you think that California itself is a piece of  fine art museums? The most expensive place to live in. If I had one magic, I want to be able to control people's mind. I will tell them what to do and when to do it. Lol.
