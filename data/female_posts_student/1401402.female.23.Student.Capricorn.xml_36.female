So I figured it would be interesting to put the words together just to laugh at. Ha Ha. A lil something something. No biggies. Hey GUYS don’t take this personal.   Beer Buzz that I had last week, I must stay deep because talking is cheap.  I want Kevin, Rory, Chao and Darol. As I continue we’ve only getting sweeter.  So I really wanna thank you my love. To me straight flirting is just like a sport. Anything is good.   A lil bit of Vu in my life. A lil bit of Anthony by my side.  A lil bit of Tyler is all I need. A lil bit of Kenny is what I see.  A lil bit of Christ in the sun. A lil bit of Harvey all night long. A lil bit of Isaac here I am. A lil bit of YOU makes me a woman.   I do all to fall in love with a guy like you. You cant run and you cant hide. You and me gonna touch the sky.
