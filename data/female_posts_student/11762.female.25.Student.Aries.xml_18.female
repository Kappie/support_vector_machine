Truth be told, I hate writing papers and sitting through hours of class lectures. I am not sure if this is a phase, but more and more I am beginning to believe that I am not cut out for academia. I want to teach. I want a classroom. I want a life outside of publishing and research. I am so bloody sick of writing about women, gender, and feminism. To think that I wanted, thought that I wanted, to study this material for the rest of my life. I love being a feminist, but I hate writing about it. I hate the theory behind it. I want to be a practicing feminist, not a stuff academic one.  There are times where it seems that I am not meant to be anything but an academic, then I start thinking about all the years of school that I have left in store for me. At best, I will complete school by thirty-three. Not old at all, but do I want to be in school for that long? I am not sure. Right now, I just want to get through this fucking semester.
