Ashley: "I hope it doesn't rain too bad since it's tomorrow"  Me: "Yeah, and make sure to video tape Taking Back Sunday... or I'll kill you."  "I know. Why don't you just come?"  "I don't have any money."  "Don't you have a bank account?"  "Yes... I guess I could dip into that."  "Well do it woman."  So after a rather lengthy conversation about circumstances and the plan of action it was decided that I was going. So I woke up early today, showered, went to the bank and took out $100 (not sure what all I could use it for but you never know), bought myself breakfast at Shipley's for $2, and returned home to dress. Oh I have really bad hiccups right now because I ate so fast. I don't know that any of you have ever heard me when I have the hiccups, but I make this rather annoying squeaking sound. It hurts when I hiccup. Poor me. Anyway... Ashley should be here any minute now. I hope I don't have to sit in the back with her sister and her sister's friend, although her sister amuses me. I'll come back with the details probably this afternoon. Peace out... :S
