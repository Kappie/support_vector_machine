At college today we were talking about dreams, I didn't realise as soon as I got home that almost everyone that I ever cared about would slap me in the face. Screw the lawyer dream, I want to be appreciated, and be in a life where people noticed me. I sit here, friendless, emotionless and officially lifeless. It's something inpredictable, but in the end is right. I hope you had the time of your life.
