I was so pissed today when i woke up because I really didn't want to go to school. I pulled a Korey and when my mom woke me up I said "mmmmm I hate my life" and went back to sleep. Just to be awoken again 5 minutes later with my mom saying "KATE YOU NEED TO GET UP NOW!" so I got to school with my jaw hurting because I was yawning so much. I really dislike B days too, which is tomarrow. Lets see...2nd period I hate the teacher. 4th period the class is useless. 6th period I hate the class and 8th period I double hate the class. Ehh, sophomore year is not really all that great. I'm excited for next year though because I'm going to have a bunch of fun classes. Well, I guess I thought photo and journalism were gonna be fun. Which they are, but the photo teacher just hates me. Journalism is good. I was really excited because we watched Shattered Glass. The new Hayden Christensen movie in there. It's really good. It's out in theaters right now, the fox towers. I reccomend seeing it. Anyway it's thursday and I totally missed friends! Thats kind of upsetting. I'm begining to watch less and less TV. I guess that means I'm getting more and more busy. Plus we don't have cable, so half the time nothings on anyway. I should go though. I'm gonna go be fat and get ice cream! See you in a while, crocodiles! *Kate ~love is like a role that we play
