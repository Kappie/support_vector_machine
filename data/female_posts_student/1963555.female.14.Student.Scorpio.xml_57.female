I figured that since it was gonna be Friday the 13th backwards we should do somthing like go to a cemetary or drive around unlit roads or somthing. Well Dacia went trick-or-treating at her grandparents. My mom dressed Julia up in a girafe costume, she looked sooo cute. She has like no hair and the girafe hoodie had a mowhawk hair thingy it was adorible! So We went to a couple of friends houses to show her off. Then we went to Blockbuster and rented Wronge Turn and Cherry Falls. (There wasn't too many good movies left) Then we went home and waited for Dacia to come over.  We watched Halloween H2O on FX. So we are waiting for ever!!! and finally she is here. So we hung out ate some of her candy and then my mom tells me to go out side and check if her coat and keys were in the car so that we could leave soon. So me and Dacia walk out to the car and as I go to open the door my Dad comes out from the shadows near the garage and screams boo or somthing along the lines of that and he was wearing the scream costume. I sreamed to freaking loud!! I was trembling I was soooo scared! Then I started crying! lol I wan't upset I just cried for no reason. Me and Dacia were laughing but I was laughing and crying at the same time. My parents were laughing and my mom came over and hugged me and was like are you ok? I'm sorry! I was all shook up after that lol! That was like the best Halloween. Oh yeah!! so anyway we get in the car after that and head to a cemitary out in the woods. Seriously like there is no lights or houses or anything out there. picture like all woods zero people 11 o'clock at night and a bunch of scared chicks. lol. We go drive up to the cemetary and  I jsut looked at it and I was soo scared I was like mom drive! I'm not going there. It was awesome though. well g2g play my drums! hee hee!! bye!!
