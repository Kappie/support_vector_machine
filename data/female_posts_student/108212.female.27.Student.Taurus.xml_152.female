We had two managers from our company (Compuware) on one of the Boston planes - I didn't know them, but it still tugs at my heart.  Speaking of, I have to play a funeral for a two-month-old baby tomorrow.  SIDS.  She was only a week or two older than Alyssa.  I'm sure she's safe in the arms of the angels, but her poor family.  So I was so ready for some good news.  Thanks for letting us know, Net.   Daf.
