For instance:   mi tavla la martan. la lojban   What happened there? We find another proper-name after the second  sumti  (arguement to the  selbri  with la lojban, with means 'Lojban' in Lojban. A direct translation of this sentence seems odd:   «I talk Martha Lojban.»  And this would certainly not be a proper sentence in English, or almost any language- besides Lojban, that is. You see, the third sumti for the selbri tavla (which, of course, you've found out by now means 'talk', 'speak', etc.) expresses the topic spoken about. So therefore:   mi tavla do la bil   Means, «I talk to you about Bill». Whatever words that are usually added with conjunctions that are inherent to the meaning of the selbri, are expressed using word-order. Of course, some verbal information is non-specific; such as tense or location, and that is expressed using particles.   But anyway, more on this in a bit.  -Ian
