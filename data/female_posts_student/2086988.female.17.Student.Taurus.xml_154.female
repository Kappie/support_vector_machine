FRIENDS FAnAtiK (11:49:30 PM): heya? ashsnl2005 (11:49:40 PM): mmmk  Anyways, today was pretty good. Got a 2 on my AP English test, which a 3 is passing, but considering I totally just blew that thing off I'm pleased with my results :) Went to Starbucks tonight with Danielle and Kiera. Saw Weston, a guy I used to swim with at MHS, but no he's doing theatre...WEIRD...lol like anyone actually tried on the swim team. Lol, I saw my old coach, Coach Files on Saturday with Embry, it was weird we were actually talking. I guess she just misses me on the team since I was one of the best swimmers...COUGH COUGH. JK! After starbucks, Kiera wanted to go to Sonic to meet up with Bryan, who I haven't seen since November of my sophomore year. But he was with his BITCHY gf, ahh I cannot stand Rachel Crowley, lol when they left Kiera and me, along with his friends were talking about her, it's mean but come on she does that bitch thing on purpose. And I had to have class with her for like 3 years in a row! It was HORRIBLE! But yeah, saw alot of old friends tonight, pretty cool I guess. Rented Along Came Polly and Calender Girls, so I'll watch that tomorrow.   And with a tear in my eye Give me the sweetest goodbye
