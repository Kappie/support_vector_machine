I have a feeling that if it could be done, it would be complex beyond all reason and hope of understanding it, as we cannot even fathom our own minds, how are we to fathom anyone else's?  As for this page, stuff that I think and feel gets left out and discarded all the time.  Even things I can open up, things I could mention, fall by the wayside, either because of embarrassment or neglect or forgetfulness.  Makes me wonder what the point is...But this is, at least, a very therapeutic experience, for which I am grateful.  My best friend and former roommate was both my confidant and shrink, and since I do not live with her anymore, I have become seriously less well adjusted.  So perhaps this forum is helping...  Or maybe not, because when I write, I tend to focus on the negative, which is good, because I get it out somehow, but is bad, because it presents a lopsided picture of who I am and what I feel.  But I guess I can't worry about that...I only have myself to worry about, and here, we're doing just fine!
