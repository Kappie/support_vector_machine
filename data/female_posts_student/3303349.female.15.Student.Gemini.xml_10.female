School is basically a dictatorship in a democratic country. Our lives are ruled by teachers and if we try to change it we are only punished. I like to think that the greatest example of this is gym class. For those of us who are not athletic, we are forced to preform at the leavel of the athletic kids in class. When we don't live up to their standards we are looked down upon or even punished. The games, oh the games. They are public humiliation. If you're playing baseball and you can't hit the ball everyone is looking at you and laughing at you. So people will even get mad at you if you strike out and don't hit the ball. We are a country that was founded on human rights. As a child or and adolesent we have no little or no rights. This is exploited by our teachers.  Also, I have been thinking lately about the Pledge of Allegence. Are we the only country that does this? It says "One nation under God" but doesn't the whole idea of the pledge break the second comandment? Thous halt not worship false idols? Americans have been bainwashed as children to stand and say the Pledge when instructed. What about those among us who do not belive in the ideals of the United states?  Well before getting too deep/ angry/make others angry, I'm going to stop.
