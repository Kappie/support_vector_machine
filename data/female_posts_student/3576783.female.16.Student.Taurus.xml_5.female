Somewhere b e t w e e n the phone calls to old friends..... And the "I miss you's", the "I love you's"....... And the "What are we doing tonight's?"..... And somewhere b e t w ee n all of the changing,growing... Somewhere b e t w e e n the classes........ And the skipping classes...... And the studying for tests.......And the pretending to study for tests....... And the downright NOT studying for tests... I forgot.......... I forgot what school was all about. Somewhere between all the appointments and starbu! cks coffees, and Diet Mt. Dew's... paying bills and then not paying bills...Making plans then breaking plans... Appearing, Disappearing, then re-appearing...I forgot...I! forgot what it was like to cry....... I forgot that pretending to be happy doesn't make you happy........... And that pretending to be smart doesn't make you smart ............ I forgot that you can't just forget the past in fear of the future.......... I forgot that you can't control falling in love........... And that you can't make yourself fall in love........... I learned that I can love......... I learned that it's okay to mess up......... And it's okay to ask for help......... And it's okay to feel like crap......... I learned it's okay to complain and whine to all your friends for a whole day........ I learned that sometimes the things you want most you just can't have. I learned that the greatest thing about high school and college and the working world isn't the parties or the DRiNKiNG or the hook-ups... It's the friendships, which means taking chances........ I learned that sometimes the things we want to forget are the things which we most need to talk about.......... I learned that time and  can heal all things... I learned that just when you think it can't get worse-- it does... but w/ the love and support of friends--you survive... I've learned that when you start feeling bad about losing touch -- those that you've lost touch w/ are feeling the same way...I learned that letters from ! friends are the most important things.And that sending cards to your friends makes you feel better. But, basically, I just learned that my friends........   Both o l d and new......... Are the most important people to me in the world. AND.......without them, I wouldn't be who I am today..... So this is a thank you to all of my friends. . For always being there. And even if we're not on good terms or we have lost touch... I will always have an unconditional love for you.. ~Always and forever ~love you!~ sammie
