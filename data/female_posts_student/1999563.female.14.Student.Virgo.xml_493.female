I got to go to the big nordstrom. Yay. I got the coolest shirt ever. Its like Lacoste but the cheaper version. It has a cute tiger on it! Its greeenn and gorgeous!  Then we went to Freddy's and I bought a bunch of stuff that I really needed.   I got to eat at pizzacotta! Its so tasty! We got to eat outside under the hot sunshine!  It was nice :)   I wish my shoutbox would work. Grr!  Laura
