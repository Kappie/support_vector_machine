Second, inexplicably happy despite the above criteria of travesty and blinking parents...      So YAY! will revel for a second... there I'm done!      Ate too much methinkses ouch.      Life takes EXCUSE ME FOR A SECOND BUSTED PISS OFF NOOOOOOOOW HOW DID THEY GET ONTO THIS CD??????!!!!!!!!!!!!! funny twists and turns eh? Eurgh another terrible song...      Films! I *love* films! Let's have a tribute to films...   "I thought that was one," I hear you say.  "That was the beginnings, an introduction, :P," I reply...  Films are easier than books in a way, easier to digest with minimum effort, except the ones requiring awesome amounts of concentration in order to just remember where the hell you are in the film (a prime example being "Eternal Sunshine Of the Spotless Mind", which is AMAZING, but hops around in time all the time, sehr confusing...) . However, do  not , by all means, believe that by this I am "dissing" books, I love them also. It's just that this is my  film  tribute, not my  book  tribute you idiots!! :P  . Book tribute comes in a later blog!  Black and white films  - well, not  all  of them obviously, but the  good  ones - are a blessing, and those of you who "despise" black and white films as a group, without even having  seen  any of them, can bugger off quite frankly!!!  OK, I must cut off my film tribute prematurely to describe a song by Stacie Orrico that just came on (listening to a freaky compilation cd I bought cos I can't be bothered to leave the room and find some decent music...  The chorous goes "There's gotta be more to life, than chasing down every temporary high, to satisfy me......" etcetera etcetera etcetera (watch The King And I!) which mildly interested me as it brought back echoes of the messages gleaned from books like "Brave New World."  anyway must go, later!
