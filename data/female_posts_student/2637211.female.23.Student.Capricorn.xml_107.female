I'm not sure why, but I have a mental block about calling people. It freaks me out a little bit, even though once I get on the phone I talk for hours. I'm just spastic. I miss all you guys in varying degrees, and I'm sorry I'm flakey and have such deep issues about telephones. They just make me uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. Panicky uncomfortable. I don't like to feel like that, so I avoid the whole issue. It's how I deal with shit: by not dealing with it. It's really healthy.
