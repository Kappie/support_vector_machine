Not exactly other things so much as other thing.  It is taking over my entire mind, my entire thought pattern, my entire existence.  Well it really isn't it just feels that way.    Everything I do that is slightly cheerful somehow always ends in me feeling selfish for enjoying myself while my grandfather is sick and dying in some strange bed.  I'll just be going along working on homework and thinking of far off things and then bam it'll hit me and I feel like the lowest life form on earth.  This morning my alarm went off at 07:07 after hitting the snooze bar repeatedly, noticing the time I began to make a wish that went somewhere along the lines of my happy teenage-esque dream that I was having, then halfway through my wish the commercial on the radio ended and this song came on:   Hello God, it's me again. 2:00 a.m., Room 304.  Visiting hours are over, time for our bedside tug of war. This sleeping child between us may not make it through the night. I'm fighting back the tears as she fights for her life.  Well, it must be kind of crowded, On the streets of Heaven. So tell me: what do you need her for? Don't you know one day she'll be your little girl forever. But right now I need her so much more. She's much too young to be on her own: Barely just turned seven. So who will hold her hand when she crosses the streets of Heaven?  Tell me God, do you remember the wishes that she made, As she blew out the candles on her last birthday cake? She wants to ride a pony when she'd big enough. She wants to marry her Daddy when she's all grown up.  Well, it must be kind of crowded, On the streets of Heaven. So tell me: what do you need her for? Don't you know one day she'll be your little girl forever. But right now I need her so much more. She's much too young to be on her own: Barely just turned seven. So who will hold her hand when she crosses the streets of Heaven?  Lord, don't you know she's my angel You got plenty of your own And I know you hold a place for her But she's already got a home Well I don't know if you're listenin' But praying is all that's left to do So I ask you Lord have mercy, you lost a son once too  And it must be kind of crowded, On the streets of Heaven. So tell me: what do you need her for? Don't you know one day she'll be your little girl forever. But right now I need her so much more. Lord, I know once you've made up your mind, There's no use in beggin'. So if you take her with you today, will you make sure she looks both ways, And would you hold her hand when she crosses the streets of Heaven.  -Sherrie Austin  Streets of Heaven   As a slap in the face guess what is playing on the radio right this moment, streets of heaven.  It is as if the world wants me to feel guilty for thinking of myself.  Although my grandfather is not a child and I don't believe in Jesus as the song mentions the song still fits in my mind.  My grandfather is fiercely independent and in that sense like a child, he begged his doctor to find some excuse to admit him because he didn't want to be a burden.  When I reach out to hold his hand he resists, and sighs, but lets me hold it seeming as if he is doing me a favor, yet when he falls asleep he clutches my hand tightly and does not allow me to let go.  So yes he does need someone to hold his hand as he crosses the road before him, we all do.   I look like a wreck, I walk around moping and unmotivated, I feel burned out; yet if someone asks me I tell them I'm fine, what else can I really say?  People don't ask how you are doing out of concern, normally, but instead do so to reassure themselves.  Hell, I don't even know why I'm so bothered today...It certainly isn't as if anything has changed, good or bad.  Instead things stay the same.  I stopped by his apartment Sunday before he went back to the hospital and asked him as he was doing.  His answer: "the same as yesterday".  Laughing I asked him how he felt yesterday and he goes, "Lousy."  So that's where we are, in a perpetual yesterday.
