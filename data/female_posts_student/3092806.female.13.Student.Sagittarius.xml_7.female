This summer has been going by SO dreadfully slow... I have absolutely nothing to do. I HATE swimming, biking, and soccer. I can barely tolerate basketball anymore. I also can't rollerblade which totally sucks 'cause if you can't rollerblade then you can't ice skate and I LOVE everything about ice skating. The sport is the only thing that I can watch on TV without wanting to leave ten minutes into it. My favorite figure skater is Michelle Kwon, hands down. I wish she'd win a Gold OlympicMedal all ready. I don't think she's competing in the next Olympics though which stinks. She's a fantastic skater though...   Anyways, I've been trying to cut my computer time down but I can't help myself... There is absolutely nothing to do. I've all ready cleaned the house, updated all of my journals and books, read from a book of short stories by Stephen King, and been on the computer. Since I hate almost every summer sport that people find enjoyable then I have nothing to do.   Ugh, my mom just came down and asked if she could use the computer. I said no. Sorry mom but I have nothing to do at the moment and Iwish to use my time up in the most time consuming thing that I can find. I told her that she could have it at six o'clock which, unfortunately, is only eighteen minutes away...   I hate time. It makes me irritated. Have you ever noticed that when you're dreading something, time goes faster? Also, have you ever noticed that when you're looking forward to something that it never comes? Time has slowed down just to make me miserable, I swear. If I could, I'd brutally murder time for making me so damn upset. Well, not really. I wouldn't murder time, I'd just yell at it a lot and maybe ground it or something.   Only fifteen minutes left to type to you in... It's gone by slowly, just like the rest of my summer will go bye... Hm... Perhaps if I make myself dread school then things will speed up a little. It can't hurt me, can it? Maybe July will end and August will begin, a lot quicker to me... I just HATE being bored... I'm such a lazy fat ass too. No wonder why I rank in the 74th percentile for weight and 81st percentile for height.   Isn't that great? I'm fat and tall. The lady in the emergency room thought that I looked like I was going into the tenth grade. UGH! My mom said that many girls my age WANT to look OLDER but fuck them... Seriously, I'd die to look younger. I don't like being well developed at thirteen. It's annoying I tell you. I mean, youbarely fit into any of the charts at the doctor's office 'cause you've all ready got your adult body...   There's ten minutes left until I leave you and go back to my life of boredom. DARN! I wish that there was something to do. I've run out of ideas. I've made schedules, diagrams, restrictions, pictures, essays, etc... What else is there left to do? I could always go for an hour long walk like I used to but last time some lady made fun of my hat and I felt like someone was stalking me... I'm SO paranoid...   I can't stop looking at the clock right now... Figures on why I'm not getting much typed... I have seven minutes left. Seven minutes of personal space and something to do. After six minutes now, I'll be upstairs doing completely nothing. I'll probably read a couple of books, write some more in all of my journals, notebooks, etc, watch a movie or two... There's a good chance that I'll be on the computer later too... Ah, there is NOTHING to do... I hate summer. Though school totally sucks, it at least gives me something to do...   I won't be bored afterschool, once school starts 'cause I'm playing soccer again this year! Yay! The one sport that I completely loathe and have no skills whatsoever in, I'm playing again. Yes, I just can't wait to humiliate myself in front of everyone, like last year...   Three minutes left... I'll be spell checking at one minute left... Yes, this is quite sad. Stupid time... I hate time... Wait, did I mention that before? Oh, I've mentioned it over a billion times, you say? Oh, okay... Sorry about that...   One minute left until I spell check, two minutes 'til six...   Damn, it's 5:59... I got to go...   Lost in Nowheresville...
