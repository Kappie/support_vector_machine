I am excited too, but I don't know about being in the sun for that long.  Forgive me for not proofing this because I can't see.  I have no glasses for a week and I have to depend on my frickin' contacts.  I haven't put them on yet because they were buggin last night.  So wish me luck today.  Anyway, Ed adn Jess are recovering.  Since Leila and I are both relatively sick, they had to drink while we played Mario Party 5.  haha  Poor Ed, I lost a lot of times.  Leila made me make her drink and I made her a messed up drink that she didn't like so very much.  haha  But she drank it.  I did feel bad, so I put more ice and Sweet and Sour a little later.  Okay, so have a great Sunday everyone.
