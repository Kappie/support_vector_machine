Meeting new people and not having to spend a lot of money because the guys are buying the drinks are very nice.    urlLink Jen  and I went to Happy Hour Friday night at McCormick and Schmick's. It was really nice we met several nice men. Couple of lawers and a guy that in the Air Force.   I like meeting new people. As many as we've met ones bond to be a keeper. I think we've ( urlLink Jen  and I)met a few these last few weeks that are going to be great friends.
