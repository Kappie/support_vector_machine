The Indiana Healthcare Ethics Networks (IHEN) “seeks to be a critical resource for healthcare facilities and others that struggle with ethical dimensions of contemporary healthcare”(http://shaw.medlib.iupui.edu/ethics/ihen.html).     This Ethics Network offers services such as:  Ethic News (which are issues published quarterly by the network on healthcare ethical issues), Literature Reviews, Annual Ethics Conferences, and a Statewide Dialogue.   	I personally feel that this approach can be very resourceful and educational for healthcare institutions and facilities seeking a plan to re-engineer or restructure their services.  The Indiana Healthcare Ethics Network not only offers services and article issues on the web it also gives institutions the opportunity to make appointments to discuss their ethical issues with the individuals of the committee.   	Moreover, the Annual Ethics Conference held by the (IHEN) includes seminars specifically addressing “Legal and Ethical Myths of Informed Consent and many other ethical issues”( http://shaw.medlib.iupui.edu/ethics/ihen.html).  Technically speaking, ethical issues usually generate from different judgments and propositions whether informal or formal.  Certain ethical issues arise from individuals not knowing the difference in fact and fiction or right and wrong.  Lastly, I feel that this approach is a great way to deal with current ethical issues and it should be formulated around all institutions around the states.  Certain protocols should and need to be taken into account when dealing with issues that will drastically change operations and plans in the challenging world of healthcare.
