The power of the Internet~   Track and field today. Phew, I think I might have a headache from that wind. Meh, whatever. Talked to Martin, Roger, and Brian. Well, I wanted to talk to Brian and was about to but before I got too far into the conversation, Nima came over so I hung out with Nima instead and Brian and I will talk later. :)  Like Erica says, GUYS ARE SO [BLAH]. Go figure out what blah is yourself. Not giving out answers.  Hm, we really should work on our dance 'cos it's so crappy right now, it's not even funny. So yeah.  Read Erica's email and read Lisa's email. Lisa's coming back sometime in August which is great! ^^ Well, I think I should go for now. Not much to blog about. I'm off. Best of luck to Brian and Alicia.  Peace.
