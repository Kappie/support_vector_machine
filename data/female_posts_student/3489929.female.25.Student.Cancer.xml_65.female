Now, however, you are being pulled quickly into the future. And about the past: you can't take it with youâ€”at least, not all of it. You must choose your baggage carefully and let go of old anger and resentment that is no longer serving a purpose in your life.      I made my final decision today. I'm going to Mississippi in two weeks. :)      I am so excited, I think I'm going to vibrate off this chair. I'm wired, baby.      Baggage going with me: my own neuroses and an "antelope" to work them off with.      Baggage staying here: my job, my failures, and my crutches (family, Lisa, Jefe, etc.)      I'm doing it on my own. I'm so damn scared. But I am really, really excited. I can't wait to get back in class. I can't wait to get started on my life. I can't wait to NOT need anyone anymore.
