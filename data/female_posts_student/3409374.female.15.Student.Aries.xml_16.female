Oh no...u know, TKGS and St. Nicholas and Dunman High all got quite a lot of peeps taking MEP, esp. TKGS. ACS(I) also not many, though. Anyway, this year's camp theme is the most outrageous one...it's about Salsa dancing. Can u imagine? It's Latin dance!! Haha...so sensual some more...some more got guys, but i survived anyway. HeeX. At first, we were all like very clumsy with our steps, but after a whole morning of training, we got used to it. Then the bad news came. We had to chereograph a performance! Can die man. So xian. At first, everyone in my group dun talk to each other...but after a long time, everyone got used to it. And guess what, stupid Xinhui sabo-ed me and now my partner is a guy.  -_-' Can u imagine? For Salsa, he has to put his hand on my back and hold hands and all...YuX...but i guess it's all in the name of dance. Well, at least he's not so bad. Some guys, esp. this guy called Marcus, is known for grabbing u on the back ok!! Then his hand sometimes also move higher and higher...damn sick...my fren  kana  him as dance partner so she told me...aiyoh...damn grose...luckily i never partnered him. Whew. After chereographing 2/3 of our dance, we went for tea break no.2 (haha...so many tea breaks) and then i saw Josh. And he was wearing glasses! Amazing. After that, we learnt about posture and physical and eye contact. I tell u, i can never keep eye contact with my partner man...he's a guy some more and not my fren also...die ar tomorrow...how to perform? Sighz...Xinhui, it's all ur fault *bleh* Nvm...soon the day was over and now my legs r still aching from 5-6 hours of dance...can't imagine those dance gals...must haf gone through more pain than us when they trained for dance nite and SYF.  I wonder how tomorrow would be like...esp. the performance bit.
