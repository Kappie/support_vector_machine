Haha, I knew it would take forever, and it did. Wow! We all couldn't just decide on a movie. We finally did decide on The Breakfast Club! But than...we realized it was rated R. Haha, we spent forever deciding if we should risk going and trying to get it. Mary Clare had her mom's card with her, but still. It was so funny, and man are we terrible, or I am at least, at doing what I'm not supposed to do. I mean, gosh, I was giggling so much, and...I make a terrible rebel. TERRIBLE! So, we're standing there in line, hoping we get to go to the young guy who looks like he might be more lenient, but nooo, we get the older bald fat guy. He still let us check out the movie. I don't think he cared that much, or the card was fine or something. So, then we went to Mary Clare's and watched it. Ohhh! It's such an awesome movie! It made me happy. I guess I can see why they rated it R in the 80's. I mean, it wasn't bad, but it just had a ton of swearing in it, and I guess some sexual inuendo...  Anyway, after that Kathryn left, and Mary Clare, Kelly, Joanne, and I just kind of sat around and talked. It was fun. I'm glad I'm close friends with them, and have them. They're such goreat friends. They're like my little group of best friends. I have scattered friends outside of that, like band people and whatnot, but no groups like that. We're really all close. I never thought I'd have an actual, "group" in high school. I guess I always thought I'd be a loner haha. Kind of funny...  We just talked about where we want to go to college, and what we want to do in life, and just some serious stuff. I don't know what I'll do without them when we all go to different colleges. It'll be weird not having them to always go to.   So, after a while, we decided we wanted to go out or something, so we went to Colonial, which was fun too. We sat and ate our ice cream and talked and blah blah. It was fun. And then, we just came home, and that was the evening. Exciting stuff I tell you, exciting stuff. I'm quite content right now with just having ice cream, and having a nice night out with my friends. I think I'm going to go to bed earlier than usual tonight and wake up really early tomorrow, go to church, and clean. YaY for church. Boo for cleaning. Ah well, I'll go read my book probably for another 2 hours. That usually happens even if I go to bed before 1. When I don't, it's even worse. I actually want to go to PrincetonReview.com. Kelly, and Kathryn said it was a good college site to go to.   So, good night to all, and to all a good night. Haha, that was always such a dumb phrase to me...I never liked it much...
