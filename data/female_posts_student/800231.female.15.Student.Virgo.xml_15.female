At least I'm kinda lucky: this is the week after winter break but I've only had to actually attend school once this week. Thank god for giant snow stormy-things.  Apparently this is the first one we've had in a decade. It was actually quite lovely yesterday, loads of powdery snow everywhere. Unfortunately, this is  Seattle  and it rained... a lot. So everything is all slushy and crap today. Uggh... it's no fun now, can't even drive in it so I'm stuck in my house doing nothing.  I woke up this morning and everything was dark and cold, REALLY dark and cold. Needless to say I spent several minutes very confused... and cold. Then my Mum wandered into my room, "Good morning, the powers out." and then she left. Just like that, now I was even more confused. So I went to find my parental type people to explain, it was 10AM and the electricity had already been out for 8 hours. Peachy. Anyway, I tried getting back in my bed but my two rabbits and my cat had already taken over. Bah, they have fur and they still steal my bed. This whole power outage thing really screws with everything though, My mum and dad had already showered and had used all of the hot water. For some reason it didn't occur to me that water heaters run on electricity. Genius, I know. Stepped into shower and nearly died, that was possibly the most exciting part of my morning...  Anywho, the bloody power in my house did not come back on until 1:30 PM. By then my house was near arctic conditions on the inside. This played hell with the tropical fish in my house.   Prior to the power coming back on I was trying to amuse myself by watching the world outside through the window in my room. It looks out over my backyard and the tiny private road behind my house. Anyway, I was watching one of my neighbors attempting to dig his car out of the slush. Now this guy needs some introduction, he's very very strange but he's  gorgeous . I'm not kidding here, I'm also in luck because he's a friend of my dad so he's ALWAYS around our house. There is one teeny tiny problem though, he's 21, I'm 15. Sadly enough, I've got a much better chance with this one though, My last major crush was 32 and errr... my history teacher.....
