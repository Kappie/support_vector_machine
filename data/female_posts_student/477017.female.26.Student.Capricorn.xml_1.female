We and our futures belong to them Exquisitely, our beliefs and our Breaths are made tangible in their love.  By their extravagant spirits, they draw us From the safe borders And into the center of the center ring There they urge dance upon our Leaden feet And to our sullen hearts, Bright laughter.  Not the crowd's roar nor the gasped Breath of the timorous can stay their mission.  There is no moderation in their nature. They spit upon their fingers To test the wind of history, They slip into our bonds and steal us Away from the slavery of cowardice.  They skin back their thin lips over fanged teeth and Rocks in hand, in our presence Face down our Goliath.  These mothers, fathers, pastors and priests, These Rabbis, Imams and gurus, Teach us by their valor and mold us with their courage.  Without their fierce devotion We are only forlorn and only fragile Stumbling briefly, among the stars.
