And what's even more remarkable is that he just called me to say MAYBE we could do something on Sunday.....  That was very nice of you, Sean. I enjoy hearing your voice...no matter how creepy that sounds...haha.....Ok I enjoy hearing your voice in a non-stalker-creepy way. Good? Ok I think that should be good...Even though my voice is a different story considering I sound like a MAN on the phone. That brings back bad memories of Evan Mosley saying I had the lowest voice on the bus. Stupid Evan Mosley...Even though that was before the whole squeakiness of boys changed their voices.  Anyways, that was completley off the topic. So yes, Sean, I'm very proud of you! Your getting over your phone phobia...Congrats, that means you can call me more!...Hah which me saying that will now make you not call me......  Meh, I'm just gonna stop while I'm some what ahead.  Wait, am I even ahead?  Ok I'm just gonna stop. I've already said way too much today....
