It's staying @ my house right now.. cause amanda's mom wouldn't let it stay @ her house (she has to pay money for pets to live in her house). well.. umm.. yeah, we were riding to burgerhouse and we saw it and it didn't have a collar.. so we took it to burgerhouse and we fed it some of our food. then we went to eckerds to get dog stuff!! hah.. we are BIG losers. anyway.. then it came back to my house and amanda spent the night and we had a big slumber party, lol. ummm.. and today we woke up @ like 6.. *sighs* and then we went to amanda's, then burgerhouse, then we went to sta trying to meet a guy named Thomas, but he didnt come.. oh well. now amanda is over here and we r umm... sitting? well.. she might spend the night again (not sure).... UH... NOTHING ELSE TO SAY! adios dudes
