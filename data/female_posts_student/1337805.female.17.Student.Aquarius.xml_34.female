So after I write the essay, I hop on Britannica, just to get a resouce and claim I used it. Do it all the time. Makes you look important when you have all these resources you NEVER USED. So I get a link, and read what Britannica offered me, jsut to make sure it was relevant. THE WHOLE FREAKING thing is filled with stuf I a) Didnt use and b) didnt know happened! And if I wasn't so DAMN lazy, tired, mad and pressed for time beacuse I have other work, I would re-write it! THAT'S how good that freaking article was.  And if that essay gets a lower mark, so help me god I am going to hack into the computers at school and change my mark to an A++++. I FREAKING deserve it.
