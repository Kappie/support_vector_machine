Who searches for "chocolate nose bleed" on the net? Maybe it's the name of a band...might be worth checking out. Probably not, with a name like that (sorry if I offended anyone...I'm sure you're band's great...). Anyway - Bristol was fun - I have actual jeans!!! And we say Kim twice. Weird girl. Not expecting to hear from Katie until wednesday, she'll be reading that book over and over * - envy - envy - * ....    So I'm weird...what's new? My brothers turning cool! He said he really loves my bracelets and said he wished he had some so i let him choose one of mine to keep - he loves it and he's even worn it to bed! How cuuuute! He likes Greenday too...awww bless...
