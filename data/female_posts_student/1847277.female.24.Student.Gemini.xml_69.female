Big surprise.  I have to start teaching myself Serbian hard core.  Now we're at my parent's house and back to the land of high-speed internet!  Whee! Christmas was good.  I got home to find my brother and sister already gone, but that isn't a huge surprise.  My brother left a message with my mom to tell me that he didn't get me anything for Christmas so to just take back what I got him, but I didn't keep a receipt as I got him exactly what he asked for, so now he's stuck.  I told her to tell him (ah, passing messages through mom) to just get me an Amazon gift certificate.   I could buy any number of things with that.   Anyhoo, I asked my parents for a Canon S400 Digital Camera never expecting they would get it (as it was $400), but lo and behold, they did.  And so did Matt, because he knew I wanted it and didn't think they would get it for me.  So then I had two of them.  Heehee.  But Matt took his back.  And although I asked for 6 Game Boy games from any number of people, no one got me a single one.  Meaning if I  had been going to India and then off all sorts of other places, I would have been oh-so-bored.   Okay, spent 10 hours in the car today.  Need to zonk out.    Happy holidays to all!
