But that's ok because one day, someone's going to get back on, and read these posts and wonder:  what  was he smoking, again, pray tell?   So, I think it should be said that I wish everyone a good first day back to Hell tomorrow.  I embraced the joys of Waffle House at my mom's request today, and now I'm paying Yazoo, Mississippi for it. I think my stomach has developed its own culture and diverse ways of life with all the grease I took in today. I just thought I would share since one of the cultures growled a "may it do ya fine" to all the BLoggies just now.  Bon chance until latré, companions.
