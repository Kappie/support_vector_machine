But then, I get caught up with this kind of thing. Behold, I have posted a part of it. A few dozen lucky rebel mamas can expect the full picture in their mail boxes this December - if I don't put it off until February. One can only look at this and snigger about the reference I had to take for it:     Great joy. Gavin had moderate success with the potty today. He pooped only feet from the actual potty, and promptly sat down on it while I picked turds off the floor. The victory lies in the fact that he now associates the potty with his body functions; now he must work on his timing. Also in Gavin news, he has been perfecting his pronounciation of the word "house". It is no longer a "how", but is a "houf". He makes the cutest scrunchy "f" expression with his lips while saying it. He also said "die-dah" when I held up his diaper. Alas, my name is still "dada", which is his favorite term for everything. Mostly he communicates through body language, beckoning with flapping fingers, pointing, or posing with jazz hands. He had a checkup yesterday, and the doctor prounounced him to be very tall, very healthy and heavy, very serious, focused, and quiet. She warned me of the evils of co-sleeping, and I laughed at her. I seriously doubt he'll still want to sleep with us when he's 16, so I'm going to savor his company as long as I can. He handled his vaccinations valiantly, suffering only a wail of dismay, and when offered a sticker for his troubles, I neatly avoided the one with a tank on it (which the nurse was proding encouragingly) and picked him a glittery silver one instead with the unfortunate word "Sweetie" across it in pink cursive. He likes shiny, so never mind the message.  I have tried to open discussion with Mike about moving to the mainland after I get my degree, but he has become comfortable here and refuses to talk about it. If it weren't for the fact that he enjoys winter so much, I wouldn't have gotten anywhere with him. He has agreed to take a road trip to scout out prospective homesteads next summer. He's still heartbroken about leaving all his friends in New York, and is really reluctant to abandon his beloved co-workers now. Maybe I'll feel the same once I make friends at grad school. Gavin could do worse than to grow up surfing and eating plate lunch.  A lot to think about...
