Who would ever have guessed that a field full of corn could be so much fun?  Many photos of C style poses and Craig and Amelia running in slow motion towards each other were taken and guess what??? you can make corn angels!!! winter fun all year round.  Now I must get to the bathroom to pick out all the bits of corn from my underwear and top.  So I had a really good day until about 4ish
