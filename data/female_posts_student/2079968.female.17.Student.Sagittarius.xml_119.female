It sort of was a very exaggerated romantic comedy...so exaggerated we might as well just call it parody. It's probably not that funny to you unless you really know us well, hehehe.  Lines from the script...both are coming from our female lead. (a very rough version because of our boredom/tiredness/geekiness...well my geekiness)  Laura (screenname withheld): "kevin and i were engaged to be married but i realized how it wouldn't work out because i still had feeling for someone and i didn't realize it until i saw you when i came home for christmas vacation"  RuminationsOf17: "you were wearing that reindeer sweater i knitted you when we were teenagers...sitting by the firelight...i saw you and my heart was rekindled with passion"  One day I might put the whole script up, if we ever finish. Why on earth we would, I don't know...  You know, Larua and I are gonna start a production company one of these days...haha.   Anyone willing to give us funding?  I didn't think so...
