Getting into a 'I don't care if I'm paranoid' thing, which is good. Mmm... maybe flying things at my window isn't such a good thing. Don't ask, and day dreaming does not damage your health! Well... only a little bit. Hmm... I'm gonna run around down stairs for a bit so my brain can frizzle out of overload. Yeay! (Freak them out why don't you?) Yup, that's what I do! Bisi!
