The only problem with this is that I have  nothing  to do.  My two patients need absolutely nothing today.  We have room to take on one more patient, but that never seems to happen during the day (people always wait until late-night to present to the ED).  So, here I am.  Waiting...    I've had time to mess around on-line, and have discovered that Gwyneth Paltrow gave birth to a large, healthy baby girl, who she then proceeded to name  urlLink Apple .  Apple .  Honey, that's a fruit, not a child.  Apple  urlLink cider .  Apple  urlLink sauce.   Apple  urlLink pie .  Apple  urlLink Jolly Ranchers .  Does Gwyneth  not  see these things coming???  On a separate note, I wonder what people call  urlLink Gwyneth  for short... Gwyn?  Neth?  Gwynnie?  My stomach is a bottomless pit today.  I'm hungry.  The cafeteria here is really not that great.  But I want food!  Nice, soft, easily chewed food.  I only have a temporary filling in my tooth as I await my ::drumroll::  urlLink Root Canal!!!   How exciting.  The  urlLink dentist  the other day was very nice, but unfortunately the combination of his niceness and my finger-crossedness did not serve to save me from the dreaded canal of root.  Tired.  And hungry.    And bored.  There must be something to do...
