I think its becuase of summer. I love summer.   Sun tan lotion, slurpees and dangerous fire torches lit by Sarah.  It is just the best.  We were talking about the Brendan Leonard Show. That show was the SHIT. I loved it. (Why do I keep using the word love? Maybe I just LOVE that word)  Does anyone remember Kevin Carlson? He was hizz-ott! (and for all those non-ghetto people out there... that means h-o-t-t-bang-me-now-your're-so-cute-I-can't-stand-it)  hhhmmmm good moods ROCK ^_^
