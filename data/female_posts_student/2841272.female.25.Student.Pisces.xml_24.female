First things first, i really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end, I felt it was a solid, well-timed comedy(definitely in a year that has struggled delivering a great comedy). It is just fun to go see a movie that you smile and laugh all the way through.   To be sure, Starsky  Hutch   was not one of the greatest comedies of our generation. It is, as the credits put it, a Todd Phillips movie(Road Trip, Old School), so there is no intracite plot or even a sure-fire concept. But the framework of a cheesy 70's cop show provides the minimal structure that his other movies lacked. With Ben Stiller(Starsky) and Owen Wilson(Hutch) taking that structure and building of it with a combination of dry, sarcastic humor and over the top situations.  Starsky  Hutch is exactly what we have come to expect from Ben  Owen. Perhaps it is not as smart or well written as Zoolander(the other major Stiller-wilson collaboration), but nevertheless the movie isn't about anything other than several funny actors making us laugh.    GRADE: B+   In closing that 70's show that you spoke of being recycled into current times would have to be Charlie's Angels.  Nick Jensen
