December 24: I had spent the night at Brittnee's house the night before so i went home from that on Xmas Eve.  I got absoutely no sleep the night before because Brittnee was tossing and turningg and snoring and then Tori, who was having boyfriend problems at the time, called at 3am.  So on this day, i was literally staying awake because of the Life-Giving Coca-Cola.  We had salmon for Eve dinner which was ewwww and we were supposed to go to our THIRD christmas even service, but we decided to blow it off.  I couldn't fall asleep that night very well either, but when i did it was midnight.  December 25: My brother woke me up bright and early at 4am because of which i was about to kill them.  I tried going back to sleep by watching MTV at 5am and seeing if maybe my brothers would be a little quieter......no, they just had to get louder.  So i went downstairs, drank 2 cokes and started to look at my gifts from 'santa".  And this is what i got total: * A cool picture frame thing * THREE DALLAS STARS TICKETS!!!!!!  Good seats too, santa creatively gave them to me by sticking them in a mini old timey ice skate.  it was awesome * Bop It Extreme 2!!!!  (Nadia- we are SO having a Bop It party now! we need to get that together!) * Tons of Chocolate, gum, sweet tarts..... * awesome clothes from my parents (they did well this year) * pretty cool makeup (i got some liquid eyeliner that i have no freaking idea how to use considering i use pencil.....) * jewelry * books * Dallas Stars hoodie and shirt * Express Yourself (some game that i have no idea how to play) * Streets of Europe Candle Set (from my brother! he obviously knows me really well! it has the streets of London, Paris, Rome, Venice, and Barcelona.  Its really cool looking and they smell really good) * Money and Best Buy Gift Cards * CDs * new CD walkman with a radio tuner on it * Clinique Happy perfume (thank god, i was running out fast) * PIRATES OF THE CARRIBBEAN ON DVD!!!!!! (oh man, i was going to cry if i didn't get that for christmas) * Ferris Bueller's Day Off on DVD (i swear, if any of you people have not seen that movie you should be shot....and then come over to my house to watch it) * The Breakfast Club on DVD (love that movie!) * Sherlock Holmes Collection on DVD * Sleepy Hollow on DVD (with, his Hottness, JOHNNY DEPP!!!!!) * X-Men dvd set * Grease Soundtrack (finally!) * Finding Nemo on DVD * League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (SCORE! Shane West is sooooo hot in this movie!) * NHL Center Ice Package!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And thats all i can remember at the moment...... So this was a pretty good Christmas, it was awesome.  Except for the part where my brother, Dillon, was shooting me with his arrows from his new bow and arrow set.....thank god it was in the garage where we have a bunch of hockey sticks laying around so i just picked one up and hit him over the head with it.  Haha reminds me of a story where me and Brittany were playing hockey at her house.  So we were playing right and then Brittany started kicking my ass.....she was scoring a goal every 10 seconds! And i got really pissed off because so far i had beat her every game that week!  So she checked me against a wall and that was the final straw, i took my hockey stick, hit her in the back and took her down.  She punched me in the shoulder a few times and kicked my shins.  I fell down and then we were both just kinda laying there and then Brittany's like "My back is bleeding really bad, i need to find my parents".  So we told her parents that it was an accident, which it kinda was, they took her to a clinic and she got a few stitches.  I had no idea i hit her that hard! So now we just laugh about it and we have to wait to play hockey again until her parents say her back is perfectly fine.  Anyways, yeah enough with rambling about pointless stories.....i have to run! bye!  Go Stars!,  ~~~Taylor~~~  P.S. - Stars game today against Nashville, i think.......they better win!  And if they don't, i'll just watch my NHL Center Ice Package!!!!
