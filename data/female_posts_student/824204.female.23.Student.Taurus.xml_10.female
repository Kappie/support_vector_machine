I ask this because I haven't been in the "single scene" in a while.  So I'm not sure how the procedure goes anymore.  Here's another thing, when you start "talking" to someone... WHY DO THEY ASSUME that "KAYO NA?" Just wondering!! It's not enough that you send these SIGNALS.  Some people are just so thick headed that you have to GIVE them a hard hit on the head and say "SLOW DOWN, I just met you a day ago!" I mean come on, aren't there anymore "courting" involved anymore? No flowers? No chocolates? No love letters?  SHIT!! Is this what dating is in the 21st century!? It makes me want to become a hermit and dig a little hole and hide in my academia and just say F*ck it! LOL!! But I do love feeling wanted again! Its nice to know that there's someone who thinks you're attractive and makes sure you know it.  I'm so easy to please.. maybe that's the problem!! Yet, I find myself being really suspicious, like when someone says "I LIKE YOU" I think, WHY? does this person just want sex? or I think, Uh Oh.. HIDDEN AGENDA.. need to find out what it is..!! Is this normal? Funny... lately no Jane.. just lots of Tom and DICKS...!! I've forgotten how to flirt with a man... or even how to act around them.  SHIT!! I really do need an update... a refresher course so to speak! HELP ME!!
