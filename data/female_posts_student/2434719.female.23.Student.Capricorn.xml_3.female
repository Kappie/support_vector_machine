Alright, as you may or may not have noticed, I have deleted my old posts (I think we can apply a good ole' ben folds five lyric here, but I'll spare you). That's right, I'm  re -jumping on the bandwagon.   Don't get too excited, you're not getting any of the dirty details.    RUThirsty3681:  shut up! (she really did just say that too.)   My head may not be as big as Kristin's, but I try to cram as much in it as I can:   most importantly, I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do this summer :).  here are the options: -stay in Denton. take summer school but survive off of pb everyday. -stay in Denton. work (somewhere?), and survive off of turkey sandwiches (meat costs more?) -go to Houston. live with the mom and dad. and dog. free rent, free food, a swimming pool, big screen tvs, nice stuff...  -GO TO CALIFORNIA. some friends said I could stay the summer with them. it's so tempting. and I thought that's what I was doing for sure, but now I'm thinking may I'll just take a vacation there?? if I go home??   what do you think? advice is nice. don't forget about storage prices if I leave Denton. I have too much stuff to lug around to other states and cities and what not. :)  also, I'm waiting to hear back about this internship I interviewed for last Friday. I had a really great interview, and the office atmosphere was awesome... I know I wouldn't be made to feel uncomfortable for a second. I feel I could really learn alot with them, and also, I would like to have some money to pay rent. That would be nice. Don't you think?  Ha, the "oohh wee" song is on my playlist. Makes me give a shout out to my homies at the MSC Main Desk! I don't know if any of you guys will read this... But this song always makes me think of Jason and Michael, freaking me in a corner at 7 am throwing check cashing money on me while this song was on....  Now that's a memory I'll always cherish...hee hee. MARY HAD A BIG OLE BUTT THEM TIGHT ASS JEANS WOULD SHOW.  I LIKE THE WAY SHE SHAKE IT IN HER THONG, OOOH WEEE.  DIRTY SOUTH! OOOHWEEE!   damn, that still is the best job I've ever had.  yes, so, okay. next on the list. school!  school is hard!  school makes my head hurt!  But what I'm most excited about is SPRING BREAK. oh yeah. you heard me. I don't have huge plans (I have a big project/presentation to work on... blech. and you know, papers), but I do have the greatest plans of all time to end it all. for newman's birthday/spring break, the ladies are getting a hotel room in downtown Houston, and doing the light-rail bar hopping thing around h-town.  dirty south!!  oh gosh yall the other day I ate all this cottage cheese. man.   I like a boy. he wears a baseball cap. I don't know how to handle that, honestly. since when do I go for guys that wear baseball caps? "YANK THIS."-kristin, on me telling her  that he wears a NY Yankees cap.  she always says the right things... I'll keep you posted on him.  if I remember who is he in two days (you know how I am).  REASONS I LOVE DENTON: --I went to my step class, and instead of peppy blonde alpha chi phi omega phi alpha whatever (no offense)  teaching it, it was this guy, this skinny little german guy! he wore a turqouise (that's how i spell it) and blue tie-dyed shirt with a big picture of a killer whale on the front... and he hopped happily to his  cover  britney spears album. I giggled the entire time.  --the coffee place I study at plays all my favorite cds, EVERYDAY.  ryan adams too!  --my professor actually asked if anyone had an arrested development cd!! my hand shot straight up; he's borrowing it right now. :) --there aren't affirmative action bake sales here. --their journalism department... amazing. amazing. amazing. this is why Texas A is never getting any of my money. :)  I've really got to get to workin'... thanks for reading about me.  I miss you :)  and that's the way it is!
