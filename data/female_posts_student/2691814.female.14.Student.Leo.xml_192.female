And it ticked me off, all i wanted todo was fall asleep and be peaceful but NOOO i had to stay up till like 3 writting down thoughts and such. I drew some things and sat on my bed thinking. And this morning i woke up at 6!!! i couldn't believe it~~i was so mad. Oh well...hey, we kinda celebrated keiths b-day last night. I got him a game (battlefeild) and he frikkin loves it, he's playin it on the comp right now. And my parents got him a better graphics card. We made a cake and sang Happy Birthday horribly lol.   Hope everyones having a good 3rd of July in Ripley! lol....we're still celebrating on the 4th like NORMAL lol  but, i dont see the big deal anymore..it was fun last year, but, i dont have friends to goof off with this time, so screw the 4th. The family might go to Seista Key and watch fire works and watch boat races or something...i kinda wanna stay home. oh wellll.....  I dont feel well....i think im getting sick again..i hate that..and when I have a cold and then have a dance class....it doesn't mix well...i always get reaally tired. I tough it out tho. Ok well thats all for now i guess, just filling you in on my horrible night lol, i miss franny :/ 'boy with the sexy hair uh oh!' hahahaha
