(thats what you get when you get a gathering of filipino's... =/) around 10 i was alone at the camp (cause all my cousins were asleep and the parents and stuff were showering) and a skunk came wondering into the camp while i was trying to brush my teeth. and of course i tried to scare it away, but i didn't want to get sprayed to i jumped back into my tent and feel asleep. then today...  finished  the da vinci code . i agree, i liked  angels and demons  better, but  the da vinci code  was the shocker, it was just one shock after another... a bit farfetched too... driving back, theres a narrow road with LOTS of twists and turns, and my mom was speeding, i swear. she also wanted a shorter car so she could drive faster O.O" wow...  now, i'm home... THANK GOD!  but tomorrow (or is it tuesday?) i get to start my 'baby-sitting' job... taking care of jackie and john till thrusday and nikki is coming on wednesday i think....  lovely. just lovely.  also, have another camping trip in two weeks, this time, for the patron side. *sighs*  i HATE cleaning up afterward... its HORRIBLE...  AND amazingly, i didn't get bitten by misquitos, truly a miricle.    thats all...  •patty•
