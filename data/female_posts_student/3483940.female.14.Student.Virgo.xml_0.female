It just gets annoying after awhile. seeing the same people day after day. especially ones you dont want to see. Or doesnt it piss you off when you say something to some and there reply is just something stupid or you wanted them to say more. BUT NOO, they are too cool for that. Maybe its just me, I am a big loser. But people piss me off. I could name a couple for example. But I wont. Lets just say that when i see them i want to punch and scream at them... wow i must sound like an evil bitch.... Im not... i just keep it all inside. I believe that school is almost over. then it will be heaven. to an extent. could it be possible to not want to see someone but want to at the same time? Well it is to me. Because that is the way i feel. I hate it. Anyways i bought Thursdays first album! Now I own all three. and i bought some kickass shoes. that i have eyed for a very long time. They are green old schoolers. I like them very much. Now im going leave.... Goodbye Hannah
