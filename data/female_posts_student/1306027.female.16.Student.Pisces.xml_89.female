But Ricky, Abby, Alesia, and Tabitha all still made it. I laughed a lot. Pop even came out of my nose at one point in the evening. It was great.  And then, Alesia asks me if I heard what this one chick had apparently been telling people about me. Now, I knew this girl had some problems with stretching the truth, but never did I think that she was capable of bold faced lies. Needless to say, I was more than a little ticked. I didn't deserve that... and I definately didn't need to hear it. I have learned my lesson once again: Never make 2-faced friends. It never works out.  Other than that whole ordeal, I had an awesome weekend. Tabitha stayed the night friday, and we went shopping with brittany on saturday. We had tons o' fun and I don't think we actually bought anything... except for tabitha- she bought belly button rings at Hot Topic.  Yea- so sorry about the boring-ness of the post. I promise the next few won't be as boring. In fact, I'm going to post something I stole from Sneaky Jim next...    I'll leave you with this, Once burned, always burned, Once Burned, Always Burning. How's that for meaningful conversation? Don't ever talk to me again. I will not answer (You know who you are.) .
