Yes, in hick Texas, but thats ok. After that, we went and got two new fish which was kinda fun, i guess. After that, i had to drive my sister to 2 different GameStops to find some kind of memory card thing. We were the only girls in there at both stores. What is it with guys and video games??  After that adventure, I went out with James for the night. We went and ate dinner at BJ's Grill... I didn't like the fod that much... well.. besides the dessert which was very good. Then we came to my house and cleaned off the shoepolish on my car (because my dad has to drive it next week and told me i had to) which took soooo long, but most of it is off! Hooray! In the process i got tons of bugbites on my legs. THEN, we met up w/ melissa and charles at sonic. We caused a little bit of a disruption, but it was more fun that way.  That was my whole day, which doesn't sound as fun or long written down... but it was. So right now my parents are at a concert @ the smirnoff center... how funny. My dad's in a (classic) 'rock' band, and now they're at a concert. But thats ok, its Chicago and Earth, Wind, and Fire... in case any of you kids know who those guys are.   have a good night everyone-  LISA  Song: "Down" - Ben Kweller
