Then after I realize how negative I was being or some of the mean things I was saying about others and it makes me feel like I am a bad person.  And now I wonder am I a bad person?  I suppose I can never really know the answer.  And well yeah I had the greatest laugh after school today.  My back was turned and this guys comes behind me and is like "hey" so I turn around then I looked him up and down and thought to myself (do I know who you are) then he was like "oh my gosh I am sooooo sorry, it's just you looked like one of my friends from the back"  Man I had the biggest laugh after that but the guy was a cutie and really nice to me, and well I realize that at B.O.B. there probably are alot of awesome and really nice people I just don't know them all. And well I didn't understand the chem lab and well it WAS SO HARD to try figure it out so I went to tutorial to find out how to do some stuff and like the chem teacher I thought was like laughing at me and like for a while she made me want to cry cause she made me feel like I am stupid but I AM REALLY TRYING to understand.  But well after I ended up laughing at myself cause she was like "yeah Vanessa thanks for playing around with this stuff, now I have a really good lesson to teach my students" so then I thought that it was kind of funny and stuff and I realized how much I made her work to help me to understand.  boy I sure make teachers work for their money don't I?!?!  Lol!
