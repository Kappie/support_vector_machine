Ok, so...this dude has been harassing me and Monica the past couple days...so Brad says somethin to him about it (I won't tell all about that) but and it got bad and Forrest...got mad about that dude bein mean and so he says somethin too! AH! I just wanna say I love them! I heart them! They are...the best guys! I'll hopefully be hangin with them a lot more soon. I'm glad Brad isn't moving to Hville in a way. He lives down my road. I would miss him :( ! Zach called me last nite b/c he hadnt talked to me in a while lol...well..since my bday. I thought that was nice. I think he still likes me ;) ! I saw *him* the other nite again.  hmmm "do you miss this?" HEEEEEEEEEECK YEA I DO BUDDY! lmao! anyways ok...so my dad may be movin to Pensacola, and I think I'd like that b/c I'd like goin down there! woo hoo! maybe Panama City but doubt it. Pensacola has a better chance I guess.  So..I got my senior pix and most of them turned out SO great. *GET THEM DONE AT CLASSIC PORTRAITS!!!* Mom's havin a time tryin to find 24 for my portfolio...she's goin crazy I think. But it's ok. Right Brad? lol. I like Brad. But I'm goin to bed...
