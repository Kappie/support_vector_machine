I guess everyoen does, so thats kinda stupid but i REALLY love summer. i'm not sure that this summer's going to be as amazing as i want it to be... its the last summer before i turn 18 so i really want a memorable, responsibility free summer... but you know how summer is never as perfect as you plan it in june. oh well, i'm still hoping for the perfect summer.  the sad part is that now grade 11 is over... for me, june is the end of the year, not december so i always get a little reminsceful at the end of a school year. i enjoy high school so much and this year went by so fast that im sad cause i know itll be over before i know it! the problem with this year was that nothing changed. after grade 10 was such a wild year with boyfriends and friends and craziness, this year was so static. i'm dating the same guy as i was at the beginning, i have the same best friends as i did at the beginning... everythings stagnated... i wish something would shake things up a bit! i remember my crazy skipping school adventures days of grade ten and i worked sooo hard in grade 11 (it REALLY paid off!!!) that i never had the same fun as i did in grade 10... so im really looking forward to some insane stuff happening all summer.  i know people can respond to my messages, so tell me your plans for summer?
