Stars play Ottawa tomorrow night, hope they do well.  2 more days until the SJ stars game!!!!!  And 1 more day until the Coppell vs. Jesuit game!!!!  This week has been so awesome!!!!  On Friday, Jess and Britty are coming over and we're going to make signs for our stars game against SJ (i got those tickets for christmas).  Here are our ideas: * "Don't touch me i'm Finnish! Kapanen and Miettinen are #1!"  * "MMK: Modano, Miettinen and Kapanen all the way"  * some sign in finnish for Niko and Antti, we need a finn to help us with that! * "Whats that cheer we like to hear!? Go Dallas Go Dallas Go!" * "What now SJ what now?" And we had others.....but i can't remember them right now :)   Blonde kid with no fashion sense update: Today he wore a very nice normal blue shirt with white lettering on it with jeans and white tennis shoes.......but still wore the ugly jacket.  I approve of everything he was wearing except the jacket, at least he was matching today.  lol, i don't know whats going to entertain me and Lauren at lunch after the tri is over......this guy is so much fun to people-watch!  he also walks very weird.....i can't put my finger on it, but he reminds me of someone........hmm i'm sure i'll get it before the end of the tri.    And now its time for the friend story of the week!  Jessica VanRiper  Lets see........i met her 2nd tri of freshman year in Masengill's class.  She sat behind me.  When i walked in and i didn't really know anyone except for Sarah and Felipe, i turned around and started talking to her.  She thought i was crazy when she first met me because the first thing i said to her was "Hi my name is Taylor and i like this boy....." and then proceeded to tell her my entire life story.  Jess was like "ok really, i don't know you, why are you talking to me" and kinda weirded out by the whole telling-her-my-life-story thing.  But we continued to talk and we did a project together on Chile.  She came to my house and we became pretty good friends.  In this Chile project, we went clubbing in Santiago, made Jess get really drunk so she threw up on Pepito (our "tour guide"), made me fall in love with Pepito, made Jess fall in love with Pepito's brother, then made us switch lovers, then we went shopping......yeah it was an interesting and twisted project.  We found out later that Mr. Masengill made it to the "clubbing slide" and then stopped reading and gave us a 94.  And i'd always stop at her locker before 3rd period and talk to her and Brittany Pleau (who is now one of my other best friends) before we went to our geography class.  Eventually i had to be moved because i was turning around and talking to her and Liz so much.  But me and Brittany became really good friends and then in turn Jess became one of my best friends.  Now me, her and Brittany are always hanging out together, watching hockey games, having hockey sleepovers, attempting to make a movie but then going to sleep before hand, playing lunar golf ramdomly.......generally everything!  Jess has always been there for me and she's a great person and i'm really happy that she's one of my good friends!  Did i mention that she is REALLY funny when she yells? Yeah, you guys should see it some time! lol, love ya Jess!!!  She's also always there to give me advice on guys etc.  Jess rocks forever! :)  Ok guys, procrastination is wearing off and i need to do my homework!  Love you all!, ~~~Taylor~~~
