Manna House is a buffet owned by the big bad Baptist church in Shreveport that all the other churches look up to: ((insert threatening music)) Summer Grove Baptist((LOL I wrote 'babtits' there originally. Thank goodness for spellcheck)) My step-grandmother who is always devising ways to get me into church never shuts up about it. Manna House is located in a shopping mall that was "converted"((LOL)) into a "church center". I think that a church-owned buffet is the funniest thing I've ever heard and it's so funny I try not to think about it. The only upside is the Sunday afternoon "church crowd" that all of us sinners dread facing has slowed considerably because they all meet up at the holy buffet. So, do you think that the waitresses stop and get in a line and pray every half hour? Because I've been to quite a few restaurants where they sing or do a line dance to entertain folks, but praying seems more appropriate for Manna House. Maybe they line dance AND pray?!?!? w00t!   the other thing is that I hate changing the litter. I love my cat, but I hate his shit that I am forced to drag around all the time. When I get older, I will find a desperate teenager and pay them ten bucks to come to my house every week and change the litter for my seven cats.
