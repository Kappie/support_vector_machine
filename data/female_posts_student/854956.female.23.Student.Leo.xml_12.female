Well, I had a good weekend, and I'm sure that next weekend will prove to be just as fun and eventful.  :-)  This weekend Ricky and Melissa came into town to finish stuff up with their Halloween costumes.  We all went to see Jackass:  The Movie on Friday night.  By "we" I mean Ricky, Mike, Melissa, and I.  We had a good time, aside from the experience I had at Jim's sitting next to Mike, who was acting like a complete ass.  But, after the movie and Jim's we went to Ricky's.  The three of them played a video game, I just sat and watched, and dozed off a few times... ;-)  Then, after Ricky had stopped playing the game, he and I were talking about various things and laughing a lot.  I was feeling silly by that point, because I was really really sleepy.  And I sorta act drunk or something when I am really tired.  It was good fun, though...!  Then Saturday morning Jamey called and told me to get down to the church to help out with the Fall Festival.  Well, it was good to see Jamey, and Pam's daughter Stacey... it was NOT good to get spit up on by a (very cute, but sick) baby.  :-(  Thankfully, I'm sorta NOT easily nauseatable (if that's a word) when it comes to kid poop or spit up/vomit.  That's a gained characteristic I got from working in childcare.  Anyhow, so, I got a spaghetti plate to-go, went home and ate it for lunch, and did some stuff around the house till I had to go to Roosevelt to pick up Mexican Dinner plates because my Mom bought tickets, and she and my Dad had to go to Shiner, TX.  Anyhow, the dinner was interesting.  I got to see a lot of people that I miss, and a lot of people that I don't miss at all.  I came home, waited for my parents return, missed out on seeing a kickass movie, but gained the chance to go spend time with Melissa and her family!  It was fun, I didn't realize how much I missed the Morris'.  And it sorta made me sad that the only time I get to see them is when Mel comes to town.  HAHA  I don't know how much they'd appreciate me just stopping by.  ;-)  Anyhow, we watched the movie "Dead Presidents."  Very interesting movie, if you don't mind war movies.  Cause for a long while there, that's what it was.  But it was funny to hear Mr. Morris's comments... hehe  Anyway, then I ended up staying there till like, 2-something in the morning, cause me and Melissa were 'girl talking'... actually, a lot of it was more laugh than talk.  But, at any rate it was lots of fun.  Hopefully this coming weekend will be just as great.  See, I tried talking Melissa into coming in town again next weekend so we could go see "The Ring"  (the movie we missed out on seeing because we were busy and couldn't make the movie on time).  So, she suggested me coming to A-Town to see the movie there with her, and that way I'd also get to see Wolf.  It was an excellent idea on her part, I must say!  :-)  So, next weekend I shall be in A-Town, doing various shtuff.  And I'll probably just stay till Sunday night this time, because my parents will be out of town and not at church this weekend, too.  So, I won't be attending church.  They'll actually be in North Austin, I believe.  But I'm not sure, so don't hold me to that comment.  Anyhow, on that note I shall close my blog entry for the day.  Comments about favorite Jackass moments (not limited to the newly released movie) are welcomed!  Auf weidersehen!      urlLink  postCount('jackass');
