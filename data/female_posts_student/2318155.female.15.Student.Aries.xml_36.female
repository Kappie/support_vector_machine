One Twenty Four is the name of the place, Wayne the pirate is the cook. wow im serious ppl ive never had food this good in my entire life, and for those of u who kno me i eat good over here at the winklers house. so anyways that was my mom and dads 20th anniversay, a very interesting one may i say. we went white water rafting that day, not too hard and had some funn. also that day we officially owned our cabin so the day was actually pretty good.   me and lauren had some interesting experiences with guys while we were up at tulloch, the guys up there are not shy to talk to u and hint that they are interested in u. one day we went up to the store by the gas station to fill up our tube with air, and this guy walks by and starts talkin with us like hey ladies, how ya doin? finally he left and we went to find the hole in the tube in wherewe would fill it up with air. we spent 15 min and still couldnt find it so i saw that guy with another guy and asked them to help us. as they looked for the hole they asked me to hold their beer bong, lovely. after they found the hole they told us they had to go cause they were goin out on the boat with a bunch load of other guys and some girls. before they left they were liek, hey by the way were havin a party at, some number of a campsite or a hotel room, and he wanted us to go yea right. this guy was ugly and he looked like he was about 24 or older. but i did see some good lookin guys from the distance in the boat, tho u kno me and my eyes (arent so good sometimes). then another time we went to the main store in town and we were lookin for some ice cream, these guys come up to us and say, is this the only store u guys have up here? we explained that we didnt live up there and we talked for a lil and then he invited us to go down to the kiva with them (a place where ppl hang and swim and bbq) that night. he introduced himself as victor and the whole time starin at laurens boobs, lovely. o and who could forget the time we had in sonora, we went shoppin in this cute boutique and right as we walk outside we hear. hey ladies, whistlin and so one. the bad part isnt that, the bad part is the fact that these guys looked old enough to be our dads gross huh? we couldnt take it nemore so we hid in another boutique and then i had to call my mom to pick us up. i had to go outside to make the call and in the corner of my left eye i see 2 guys pushin each other and im like what the fuck r they doin? i musta givin them a nasty look cause after a while they went away. i realized afterwards that one of the guys was pushin the other to talk to me, and...o well. then we went over to baskin robins when my parents picked us up and we got stared at in this grocery sotre that we went to look at some magazines. wow did we have an interesting time like i said. i mean come on when theres ppl on jet skis comin over near our dock and lookin at us it gets a lil annoying,u kno what i mean? i mean dont get me wrong i luved the attention at first but then its like this is gettin to be stupid.   me and lauren had a funn time layin out and gettin tan. wow did we get tan? lauren especially shes liek brown now! and then our tubin experiences. my dad whipped us around this uturn once, and omg did it hurt. we tumbled and rolled we dont kno how many times and well lets just say afterwards we came out of it with a hurt neck and a splittin headache. tho i have to admit it was tons of funn. one time out bottoms went to out ankles and were like no bottoms! lol and laurens boob stickin out to the side of her lifejacket, lovely. o and my dad yellin at me for leavin the blowdryer cord in the sink. hes like u kno thats really dangerous danette, if somethin were to happen bye bye daddy....french fry! omg wow was that one of the funniest things ever?! then my mom yellin at my dad when i went lookin for directions on the raftin trip....god u got the kid lost! woo funn times, good times! i think thats it from the vacation but ill let ya kno if theres nething else.   last night was funn i went to celias with my mom and dad and ran into lindsay and said hi. then i went to blockbuster to renew my freedom pass while my parents went into rite aid. well i wanted to hang with adam while i was in there but he was on his break so i was gonna go meet him but i couldnt renew my freedom pass because i needed a credit card. i called adam and went to go see him at round table across the street, i gave him the middle finger stuck my tongue out at him and then he almost ran me over! lol, he invited me to go into his car and then as i went to sit down omg that was gross! there was an old french fry and an inch thick of cumbs on the seat i couldnt do it, im sry. so i told him id meet him at blockbuster cause i had to get my parents credit card. i got some makeup in rite aid and then i went over to blockbuster to get my movies and renew the pass and see adam mostly (:! he was in the back room so he let me in and no we did not do anything back there, i ate some of his pizza and looked around the tiny ass room that they have and he slapped my ass then he said danette we have to get outta here cause ur temptin me andi dont wanna get in trouble... ok ok. so i got the movies and said bye to him. around 11:30 i called him and we talked cause theres like no one there around that time and yea we had some interesting conversations. i luv adam i really do (but just as a friend may i say) and i cant wait til we can hang and he doesnt have to be busy workin! my parents arent too cool about the whole deal since that hes 22 and all, but what parent wouldnt be? i mean honeslty all i wanna dois hang with him and get to kno him better as a friend. and u never kno when i turn 18 and were still friends maybe well have somethin there u never kno. imma have to sneak seein him until my parents get comfortable with the idea of me and him hangin so missy is gonna pick me up and take me to him and then well hang for a while and then hell take me to missy's house when were done hangin out and shell take me back home. yes i think itll work. well yea thats about it for now....i think.   imma be off to work today for b shift so i gotta start gettin ready, i may have to ride over on my skates or just walk i think. my mom and dad arent here so yea maybe ill get a ride outta missy or peytons mom who knows?
