(yes! i did have my class since my school is in qc...) i saw someone from my past.. but i did not talk to that person since i was inside the vehicle.. and even if i wasnt!!  i saw gurkirpal AGAIN!! he approached me coz i was alone while waiting for my friend, jodette!!  i was half-asleep during my biblical studies class.. but i had a longer last night than the night before.. why's that?!   i had an argument with a guy classmate who wasnt even close to me.. i dont like the way he talked to me.. he was shouting!! he keeps mentioning my name.. as if it was the first time he knew a girl named alex!! he really got to my nerves...  i reached home at about 7:35.. i was really happy coz i have a new cabinet.. now i can organize my things.. yay!!!
