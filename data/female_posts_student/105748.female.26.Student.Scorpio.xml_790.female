Looks like a couple of birds will be able to fit my belly for Thanksgiving.  Dot will be impressed of my determination.  I hope to lose at least 10 lbs by next Thursday and I am also determined to keep it off.  I have renewed faith in my health kick.  Wish me luck on my quest.    more to come...  NET
