We cheered ourselves hoarse. I think the last time I felt this high was during our Lifeskills Camp Formal Dinner. But now that I'm home and everything has quietened down, I can't switch back to my mundane lifestyle. The worst thing is I have to wake up in about 7 hours' time to prepare for school, while I'm still having trouble getting over all the excitement today.  Today is also the last time I'll be going back for band practices, so I'll have no more excuse to procrastinate my revision. I wonder if I'm supposed to be happy or sad. Anyway, it's about 47 days to our first prelim paper. The problem with the future is that it keeps becoming the present. It seems like yesterday when we still had about 200 days to our finals. Sec. 4s! Do you feel the adrenaline pumping?? I better stop laming around and get cracking, so I won't be blogging as much now. Maybe only once or twice a week. Keep checking back for new updates though!
