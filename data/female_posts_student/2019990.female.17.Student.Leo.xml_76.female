Rent, death, and many looming deaths.  Romeo and Juliet two deaths.  Moulin Rouge, a death.  Wicked, much turmoil, a death.     Wicked is this really cool musical I just discovered, it's the story of the wicked witch of the west and how she became wicked.  It's really neat, and I feel really back for the wicked witch.  Her name is Alphaba in the musical.  And she's an outcast, and decides she doesn't want to be held in by all the rules of society, and wants to do good on her own.  Then she is declared wicked and hunted down, until the inevitable end.  My theory is that the writer wrote Wicked just to screw people up when they watch the Wizard of Oz.  I now feel incredibly sorry for Alphaba and rather despise Gelinda(the good witch).  Most artists are a little warped though, they probably figured well, if we're warped they might as well be too.  Well I had best be getting to bed.  Have a wonderful whatever time you read this.
