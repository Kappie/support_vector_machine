Anyway, news flash: According to El Padre, I'm going to be doing most (if not all) of the textual input for this blog. This reduces it from "The McDaniels (and Arendales) Do San Miguel" to "Meagan Does San Miguel with Possibly the Occassional Piece of Commentary from Dad, Except He's Probably Too Lazy to Do Anything but Upload the Zillion Pictures He's Taking, and Even Then, I'll Probably Have to Teach Him How to Do That."   Oy.  But ah well. It's Mexico! Who really cares, eh? 'Sides, you don't mind hearing only one side of the story, do ya? Do ya? Well, you'd better not, so there.  Aaaaanyway...Might as well tell you about getting here, cuz that's a whole story in and of itself.   ---  THE McDANIELS GET TO SAN MIGUEL  Well, the first thing that happened was that it took us forever to get packed up and piled in the car. No surprise there. But we'd left the car doors open in the driveway for so long while we were loading our luggage that the battery died, so we had to use Dad's car to jump-start it. Yeesh.  We drove to Port Mansfield (sorry if I spelled that wrong) that day and chilled out. I called my folks and my best friend Becky, munched on peanuts, and watched Nick at Nite on the big ol' TV they had in the lounge at the Mansfield Club. Lesse, couple of episodes of  The Andy Griffith Show , couple more of  The Addams Family , and my first two viewings of  Green Acres . Yes, I had never seen  Green Acres  prior to that. Makes you worry about the world, doesn't it?  So Dad decided that we should go out and see the deer feed, which I didn't particularly care about, since I've seen more deer up-close to satisfy me a lifetime. But me, Dad, Laura, and Lizzie drove out anyway. It was too early, so we didn't see any, 'cept a couple. But we did see three turkeys, and a cat, and heard some bob-white quail. Turkeys! Whoo!  Back to the Club to eat. Had fish that the Arendales caught; was very good despite being bright green. I think they used green spices on it or something...*shrug* Dunno. But then we just went to bed and got up at six the next day to start driving. That was yesterday.  Yesterday was...ooh, bleck. Twelve hours in a car! Well, first we drove across the border, but the place where we were supposed to register the car had no electricity. So we drove around the border of Mexico and found another place, but we didn't have the title of the car. (Don't ask; I don't know. Some paper.) We parked, and Dad and Ben took a taxi back to the States to see if they could get the title faxed to them in a hotel. We could've taken the car back across, but the U.S. customs people prolly would've confiscated all the wine and beef we'd brought. *cough*You didn't read that.*cough* Yeah. So Laura, Lizzie, and I chilled out (metaphorically speaking; it was hot) in the suburban. Laura called her mom in Houston, who went to the house to get the title to try and fax to Dad as soon as his taxi got over the border and he found a place with a working fax machine. (Whew!) Mrs. Morton (sorry if I spelled that wrong too) couldn't work the fax machine, but fortunately Elliot showed up at the house and did it. And while all that was going on, Laura went to go exchange our American money for pesos. Finally, Dad n' Ben came back with like six copies of the Holy Title, and the cab driver that had gotten them through it all led us to the vehicle registration place. All went well there, and we paid the cabbie like $100 (American equivalent). Juan was one happy Mexican, I'm sure.  All told, we lost about three hours' time, and were really lucky that things turned out as well as they did. I didn't have a real problem with any of the delay...I was in the parked car the whole time and just sat and wrote. (Journal power! W00T!) We drove straight to San Luis Podaci (yeah, definitely spelled that one wrong) except for one stop for gasoline, which was like seven hours. We kinda got lost in San Luis, but we again paid a cabby to show us the way and made it to the Westin Hotel unscathed. (There were some close calls, though. Fortunately, Laura's an aggresive driver. Or maybe BECAUSE Laura's an aggresive driver...)   The Arendales, who didn't have all the mess at the border to contend with, had gone ahead, and we assumed they'd be two or three hours ahead of us. But as it turned out, they got lost at every turn, and showed up at Westin a mere fifteen minutes before we did. Har. Made ME feel better about it, anyway...  Westin was a really nice hotel, to put it mildly. Four-star for sure. We all ate dinner (the only real meal of the day) and crashed pretty early. Actually, Ben and I stayed up for a couple of hours watching TV...It was pretty cool. I saw  Invader Zim  for the first time ever, but it was in Spanish, so I'm not sure I quite caught the plot. One thing's for sure, though...Mexican Gir RULES!  But we finally went to bed around midnight or one or something. (There wasn't a clock in our room...strange.) Up at seven, breakfast at the hotel, and then it was back in the car for the last two hours of the trip.  Nothing unusual to report about getting into San Miguel. Saw lots of sheep, if that counts for anything...and those low stone walls that farmers used to fence in their livestock hundreds of years ago. Lots of those.   Skipping the part about getting here and picking out who was sleeping in what room and all that. Maybe when I have more energy I'll describe the house in Awesome Fiction-Novel-Esque Detail, but I just wanna finish this entry right now so I can nap or swim or something. Maybe nap in the pool...*yawn* Suffice it to say that my first reaction upon entering this house was, "I died. I fell over and died and now I'm in heaven." Seriously. It's THAT awesome.  Since we were all hungry from the moving and the driving, we went out to eat at Mama Mia's, the best bar in San Miguel. We had food, of course, not just alcohol.  Las quesadillas son deliciosas!  Then Lizzie wanted to go to the market, but Dad n' Laura didn't want her wandering around by herself, so I had to go with her. I didn't mind THAT much...I acted like I did, but it was nice to see the town again. And I found the Petit Four, my Swedish patry shop that I walked to every morning for breakfast. Score! ;-)   [We interrupt this blogpost to mess around on mIRC.  ...  ...  ...  We now return you to our regularly scheduled blog.]  But mostly it was just us wandering around lost until we finally called a taxi to take us to the market. By the time Lizzie was done looking around, we were both unwilling to walk home, so we took...yes...a taxi.   What is our address, anyway? 62 something that starts with a B. I wanna say Barrios, but I know for a fact that that's not right. Oh well. I'll figure out where I live later.  Maybe this wasn't enough of a post, but oh well. I'm still tired, and now it's almost 6:00. Yes, this took me an hour. I'm slow, OK?
