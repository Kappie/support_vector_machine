I woke up from my hours of precious sleep, a little groggy, but glad that I got to go to school and present my monologue that I am so proud of and that I agonized over from noon until midnight last night and countless hours in between. So I popped a caffeine pill and was on my way.  I got to school feeling quite chipper and handed in my assignment to the teacher. towards the end of class she began to read our monologues and when she got to mine she said to me from across the room "caitlin, this is not going to work." I blacked out a couple seconds, I couldn't fathom how something I had put so much effort into, something I had let get to me so much I was unstable, could be wrong. "I don't think this subject matter is appropriate for middle school children to hear." my eyes fuzzed over, I couldn't breathe, I couldn't speak, I felt the blood rushing to my head making me dizzy, tears welled up but I managed to choke them back, it was as if she had told me I was being put on death row with no hope of acquittal, that everyone I cared about will be tortured to death because I was too busy writing a bad monologue to care about them. I was speechless, devastated, unmitigably enraged, to a point that I lost touch with everything. I stumbled from the classroom, ignoring the teachers spouting, I was a puddle. I found my way to geometry, ignoring people around me, and I don't really remember what happened that whole hour. Even retelling it now, I'm pulsating with anger and despair.  MY MONOLOGUE FOR CATHERINE DE'MEDICI  Good morrow my lords and ladies, how dost thou be on this most gloomy of days? I beg thee forgive my foul disposition for I am quite distressed. My title is Catherine, Queen of France, my surname being DeÂMedici. Might you know of them? 'twasas announced this morn that the King has entrusted Diane with the crown jewels of France! How dare he do such a thing as that! And she, Diane de Poitiers, Duchesse de Valentinois, and of nothing! Prancing about the palace like the harlot that she is, living in the Chateau at Chenonceaux, which I, the queen, had expressly desired. As has been said, a mistress is one thing, but such blatancies!  She is a clever thing, and political astuteness I must give her, yet must she be so involved in HenryÂs affairs? Writing official documents and influencing all of his decisions as if she is of any high stature. ÂSigned, His Majesty, King Henry II of France and his wenchÂ I can only imagine! But alas, it is my duty as queen to keep an even temperament in times as these. I do love my Henry, and every courtesy passed between myself and Diane I permit for his entertainment. And still, how can I cast blame on him? She, being so thin and fair, and I, lacking such loveliness and wit.  It is that very wit that shall be my end if I do not tread lightly. I know of her scheming, of her devious plot to goad Henry into divorcing me because I have not bore him any childrenÂas of yet. I will produce an heir when the all is right, I am sure of it. IÂm Biding.biding my time. But perhaps the king is at fault? Perhaps his love for Diane preclude his desires to produce a royal heir with the queen? What of that?  The crown jewels of France! The royal mistress! PreposteroIs!  I can understand how if I had written this out of the blue, it may be a tad racy for middleschool children, but this is HISTORICAL FACT AND IF THEY CAN SHOW VIDEOS OF PEOPLE BEING TORTURED DURING THE HOLOCAUST, I THINK I SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DISCUSS A FEW VERY VAGUE DETAILS OF AN AFFAIR THAT REALLY HAPPENED AND IF THE IDIOT TEACHER DIDN'T WANT US TO TALK ABOUT THAT KIND OF THING THEN SHE SHOULDN'T PUT THAT KIND OF PERSON ON THE LIST OF PEOPLE WE COULD DO BUT IF SHE DID THAT THEN THERE WOULDN'T BE ANYONE ON THE LIST BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS DONE THAT KIND OF THING.  ok I'm done.
