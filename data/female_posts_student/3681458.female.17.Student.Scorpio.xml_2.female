I had a couple of days to think about it, and I finally talked to Matt last night about it.  by that time, it had all built up and I pretty much figured everything Quinton had told me was true.  Turns out, I shouldn't believe Quinton because he tells Matt the same things about me.    At one point and time both of them liked me, and basically I had to make a decision between the two (which wasn't hard to do).  But in the meantime of me making that decision, I basically tore that friendship apart.  We all still talk, but it's not like we hang out like we used too.  I can't figure why Quinton would want to lie to us like this.  He told me a long time ago that he was over me, but is that really true?  I don't want to jump to conclusions, it's not like I will be talking to him for a long time anywho.  I just can't figure why so many people want to tear us apart.   I have now made the decision, and regardless of a promising opportunity to date someone else... I am sticking with Matt.  I am glad we are getting back together.    Did I mention I got a new job?  I am working at the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory in our town's mall.  Wahoo!  Nothing like being surrounded by chocolate and being asked to try it because you need to know what it tastes like for the customers.  =) I work tonight, and it feels weird, b/c I'm actually excited.
