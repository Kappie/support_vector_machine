At first I didn't know what I wanted to do at all so I just picked something cool, "Recording Engineering"  I found the most awesome college in East Bay so I was getting all excited about that and the thought of being a recording engineer is cool but I just don't think I'm cut out for it, and I have to admit it.  But I was going along with it because the colleges for it are specific for it and are easy to get the information from. Especially the one I was researching in East Bay.  But then in Computer Programming class we had to make up a business and I totally forgot about my career idea that I had for a few days during the Summer before my dad shot my dreams up saying that it was risky business so I just forgot about it.  But I've been thinking about it more and more and I just think I would be the happiest person I could be if I could do this.  All I want is to own a small indie record/music store somewhere in an underground part of a city like Washington DC, somewhere in CA maybe, somewhere.   I was thinking about it and I think maybe DC is best, depending on where I go to college I think though.  So after much debating I decided to risk switching topics half way through the six weeks.  It's harder because thse aren't little specialty schools, but it's worth it because this is what I am for sure going to do so I might as well get ready for it now.   So the colleges I'm doing are Longwood, VCU, and Berkeley.  Longwood is there for a nice local college that I know for sure I could get into.  VCU is probably my best bet. I'll probably end up picking that one. Because they talk about "Small Business Ownership" alot in their course description which is EXACTLY what I want.  Berkeley is there because I like the location. And I'd go there for two years then hopefully get into the Haas Business School.  So I'm hoping to major in Business Administration.  The only problem with all this is you know, with business you need all that team work and leadership crap.  Man that's my biggest downfall.  But I really want this.   I imagine this little store, that all these subculture kids come in and they find their music and it's a friendly nice happy atomosphere. Just full of the air of music. Not the sound of music, but the feel of CDs and albums and records. Maybe you dont' feel that but I do anytime I'm in the music section of any store. I could live in a music store. I can spend hours just browsing, not even buying anything or seeing anything I want, just being there is enough for me. I think I would like to live back behind my store in a little dim room with a bed in the corner, and a little microwave and refridgerator in the corner.   I get all tense and anxious and excited just thinking about my little store.  Oh you don't know the kind of happiness it would give me if it could be exactly like that.
