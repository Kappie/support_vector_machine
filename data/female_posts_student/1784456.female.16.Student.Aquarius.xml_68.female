Hehe, look what I've done though! Hehe I'm watching this really stupid paintball programme yeay! PE was really annoying. Becki had a thing about ignoring Emma and me, but then we had to show it. So I kind of crouched down for the whole thing saying 'Emma! What are they doing?' Cause they added loads more stuff. Hmm, fun fun fun! Then, when I was walking home (yes, it's Izzy's favourtie subject) I went a bit crazy and started classing every one as sweets... No, I'm not going mad *cough* hey! So erm, oh, I'll tell you if you want to hear it or not! These two parents, and two little kids walked past and one of the kids was wearing these stupid but cool sun glasses. So they were sweet. Then this 'lady' walked past. She sucked her lip in, refused to look at me and tarted about. She was sour. Then this weird man walked past and I couldn't work it out so he was lolly pop...I'm sure you're all admazed by this! Hmm, why is my internet soooo rubbish? I'll just stay on this cause it's the only thing that works...no, to keep your sanity I'd better go. Oh and Izzy I'm trying to put Zigganought on geocities! (If it'll ever load!)
