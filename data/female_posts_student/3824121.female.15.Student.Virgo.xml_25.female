I DONT wanna  go back to those damn crowds. My god. Day in day out crowds, crowd after crowd. And people are so incon fucking ceterate.  They stand in the MIDDLE THE FUCKING MIDDLE of the damn hallways and chatter. Chatter chatter chatter! And its usually a huge group too.  Then if its a small group, its always in front of the staircase of the doorways. Its SOOO annoying. And when the late bell rings, everybody then rushes to get to class. Do you know what its like to be short in a stampede of people who still chatter on the way to class?  In othernews, my nephew is getting more annoying each day. I'm actually starting to look forward to the crowds. AND going around the entire school to find the least crowded area. Usually that means going outside, and sadly, outside is hot. Always hot. Like I was saying, my nephew keeps acting so annoying. >  You don't know how good I feel when he finally goes down for a nap. ;D
