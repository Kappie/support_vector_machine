It's good that I'm busy, though because the work is a bit numbingly dull.  If I weren't so busy, it wouldn't be fun.   But I've also had a few other job offers thrown my way... which may wind up working out.  Because although I would love to play with brand new babies, and I could create my schedule to accomodate my schooling (instead of vice-versa), I won't have benefits or a guaranteed number of hours per week.   So I may see about taking a job as a unit secretary inb the hosital doing medical coding, transcription, etc... That'd be okay by me.  I'll even be able to work from 7-3, and take classes at 6 without worrying about making it on time because of traffic or whatever.  And always have weekends off.  So we'll see.  I babysat for the very first time on Wednesday.  I sat for Michael Clark (Jeannette and Jason's munchkin)and we played and had fun.  Then he got tired and cried himself to sleep.  It broke my heart.  But we sorted ourselves out.  I adore that kiddo.  I got a pedicure today, because I got paid.  And I got pink nail polish because I never do.  ME!  Pink!    So, that's about it for my news.  Annie, I would LOVE tor ead your Joe Vs... paper.  I think I asked you for it while you were writing it!   And please read I Am the Cheese!  It's a freaking weird book, but I liked it.  Oh!  David Foster Wallace has a new collection of short stories that is supposed to be wonderful!  So, that's on my list.  I keep reading.  and reading and reading...
