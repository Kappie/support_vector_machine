Ok first week at Spring Harvest I was in the Paint Factory doing 5-7s.  The whole theme for Spring Harvest this year is Grace and we were looking at Judges 6-8 and how God shows his grace by constantly helping the Israelites to get out of sticky situations, and this time specifically with Gideon.  We had to start work at 7:30 each day when we would spend some time as a whole group reading Judges and praying and stuff. Then we would set up our venue and the activities we were going to do with the kids and pray together with our co-leader (The 360 kids were split up into ‘pots’ of 16 kids with 2 leaders).  Then at 9 we went to Good Morning Big Top, which is half an hour of all age worship and a fun enactment of that days passage in Judges. Then it was a quick run back over to the paint factory to welcome and greet the kids.  The morning was spent in our small pots and also up on the Factory Floor learning about Gideon and singing etc.  The kids would then be collected at 1.  Each day Bertie the paint machine would mix a colour and that would help us with our clue which would teach us something about God.  So on day 1 it was a blue mirror which was to remind us that God can use anyone – when you look in the mirror God can use that person. Day 2 was a red smiley face which reminded us that God keeps his promises, day 3 was a purple strong arm – God is powerful, day 4 was a yellow hand – God helps us and day 5 was a green crown – God wants to be our King.   I was co-leading with this amazing lady called Ruth who had been doing kids at Spring Harvest for about 7 years.  She and her husband, who was also on team, are foster parents and over the last 14 years had fostered over 200 kids!  She was SO lovely and encouraging.  Often I end up being put with someone who either is really apathetic or who is just really difficult.  But Ruth was really keen to do stuff and was also happy to use my ideas and stuff, and kept saying how good I was with the kids.    Anyway through out the week the leadership team who were running the Paint Factory were really friendly, encouraging and accepting.  They kept saying lovely things to me, but of course I didn’t listen or didn’t believe them.  I was struggling as usual to believe that God loves me let alone wants to use me, that I wasn’t anywhere near as good as everyone else, that I couldn’t possibly be doing anything beneficial.  But I really did feel I had learnt so much during the week that through looking at such fundamental truths in a way that was accessible for kids, I had really started to believe some of them.  So often us as adults complicate things and put prerequisites and added extras on God’s promises and words, and yet that isn’t what it he wants. The kids really challenged me (if God is loving how come he sent the Midianites to attack Israel? How can I make a super fighter bomber plane out of straws?) But they also encouraged me and gently helped me forward.  When a child of 6 who doesn’t know all the historical and scientific evidence for Jesus and who isn’t aware of all the promises God makes to us in the Bible, is able to say that they believe and will trust in God and are wiling to be honest with him and ask him for help; it demonstrates so clearly to me what a gentle, accepting and understanding God we have who meets us right where we are. Gideon was a nobody, he wasn’t an exceptional person, he made mistakes, and he questioned and doubted God, yet God still loved him and used him.  Maybe there is hope for me yet! Also learnt a new skill of filming!  I offered to go out a couple of afternoons and film Leanne and Julie – who were the factory workers, playing on different things around site – to show the kids what they had been up to.  We also made a video for people volunteering next year to show at the briefing day to show them what Spring Harvest is like.  See undiscovered talents!  I decided to write a short letter to the leadership team thanking them for everything – which ended up as a 3 pager!  The next day people from the team came up and thanked me for my letter and said how much is meant to them.  Julie who was co-leading the programme came and told me how she has the same doubts about ever being good enough and what she is doing here.  She also asked me if I would like to help on a summer programme she is doing.  Then Alan who leads the programme came and gave me this huge hug and said how amazed and impressed they had all been with me.  How I was always the first to offer if help was needed, how I was always smiling, how I was so enthusiastic, how good I was with the kids, how much effort I put in, how honest I was.  And that they really saw potential in me and he knew that God would use me hugely in the future.  He then said that he would really like me to help again next year and would I be interested in maybe in the future getting more involved in the leadership?!!!! I almost passed out!  He said that they looked at people’s character not how good or perfect they were, and that I had the right character for this type of work!!  I was so astounded.  Ruth and I had a chat later that day, and I told her about my feelings of worthlessness etc and she said that she could tell I was a really special person and she was going to keep reminding me of that.  She gave me this little card with ‘God loves me because I’m so special’.    Ok part 2 to follow later! Can't believe it: i'm leaving in less than 48 hours!!  love Karen p.s. i'm not impressed with the certain lack of homework carried out by you guys during my absence!   p.p.s i have got so much blog-reading to do I don't know if I'll get to bed tonight!
