Okay, the dude who is always saying "i wanna fuck u" "when can we hook up?" almost every hour is now telling me how much he loves his gf, who just broke up with him. keep in mind, while he says these things to me hes dating her. well, his gf broke his lil heart and i feel bad for him i really do, and im nice and i give him lil *hugs* and tell him everything will be ok. and tell him that im here for him..u know the usual speech i give to anyone. but the funny thing is, i honestly mean that speech everytime i give it! dammit im so nice. hahaha AND IT NEVER FAILS he still wants to fuck me when hes supposed "upset and heartbroken" i just cant win. i figured i'd get a break from the guy. i guess not. and hes not even a hottie..lol now if he was bangin it might be a diff story. then riskin getting my ass kicked by some mean bitch would be worth it. lol cuz god knows i cant defend myself! haha lauren, can u see me tryin to beat someone up?! yeah i can..RUN RUN AWAY AS FAST AS MY LITTLE LEGS CAN MOVE!! one day all that soccer will come in handy. haha I found this skaters blog from the cary area..speakin of cary, GRAHAM COLTON BAND!!
