Tonight kirby came over and we decided we would go buy Rara a Jesus Fish bc she hates those fuckers and it would be a sweet gift for her for when she gets back home... I miss her so much! Then we went to heathers but heathers sexy ass was still in the shower so we decided to go to Manual and pick derek up from night school , he basically skipped it to be with us :) then we went back to heathers and decided to chill awhile, and heather and i got into the old rap music that she was blasting thru out her house lol good times lol then we went driving, and i made krissy drive my car so i could sit next to derek, it was FuN! lol Then we went deep into the ghetto to pick up Sarah, shes like this knock out italian girl who should be on like the sopranos, BADA BING! LoLz! then we just drove around and yelled at people and just chilled and had fun! I have the most fun when i just relax with friends, idk its like i can be so lazy around them lol i mean i didnt even drive my own car lol Now tomorrow i think krissy and i are going out, she has a college class at 6 but when thats done, we are heading out into the town. but tonight was alot of fun id have to say, and whats gonna be even better is when derek comes over tomorrow to pick up his books, *wink wink* lol i dont know why i like him so much now, its like when i look at him or am even around him i just wanna start kissing him as if he is my bf ya know? ever have that feeling? i just wanna hug him all the time and never let go, ok now i sound corny lol but thats how i feel. I havent felt like this since i dated greg, not even around dustin did i feel like this, so basically it must be a greg/derek thing, who knows...
