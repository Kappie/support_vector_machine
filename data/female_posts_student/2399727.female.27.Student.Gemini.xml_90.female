She did my fields on the spot, checked my IOP, retina, implants and optic nerve and demonstrated a great deal of patience with my list of questions.  A really excellent doctor, completely worth waiting for.  She is also going to monitor me every two months for a little bit while she experiments with taking me off some of the glaucoma medications I am on.  The first to go -- yippee! -- is the oral acetazolamide.  Her reports, by all accounts, were very good.  My eye is more stable than I thought, and while I have a blind spot as a result of the tear (the scar tissue makes it impossible for the images to be processed through my brain in the exact spot opposite to where the retina tore) and I have lost about a ring or two of peripheral vision all the way around my good eye from damage to the optic nerve, I came out of this summer's ordeal relatively well off.  So, good news and I'll see her again in May before I see my retinal guy again in July.  She found my scar from the reattachment surgery and was impressed with how well her colleague had sewn it up last August.  He'll be chuffed. :-)  More to come...
