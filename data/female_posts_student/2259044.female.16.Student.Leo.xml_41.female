I'd like to say im leaving; that i'm completly walking away. I wish I could say, im strong. I wish I could say we're through. I want to be able to say, im not giving in this time. I know the only thing I need to do is just walk away. I want to tell you that I wont let you hurt me anymore. That I'm moving on. That I'll find someone who wants me. But I can't. I'm not strong. When you snap your fingers I'll come running. I'll let you use me whenever you want. I'll pretend I don't care about all the other girls. I'll pretend that this is nothing to me, that I don't get hurt when you don't call. That I'm not hurt when you ignore me.  But it's okay, because this is my choice. I know that by hanging on like this, I'm choosing to let myself be hurt. I guess, "some things you don't leave until they leave you." -funny how sisters that r so different, are so alike...changedfish
