But sometimes it seems like I'm the only person crying out for help. Sometimes it seems like I don't fit into this world. But other times I'm fine, I'm normal, I'm happy. Right now i'd have to say that my life is awesome, only because I found someone special, someone who I love and cannot be without. But what happens when that is gone? What would I do? How would I deal with myself? You see I love Brandon so much, I could never let go. It's to the point that I could never ever imagine us breaking up. But I shouldn't think about this, breakin up and all. Cause I don't wanna break up with him, i'm just worried, what if? I guess I worry too much, that's my problem. I try to keep a happy image to where no one can see how I feel at the time, but it's hard. I know it's not good, I keep it all inside myself. It builds up day after day, month after month. Until it finally is too much, and I can't handle it, I just explode and say things I don't mean. Usually this happens towards the end of my school year. It's happened for the last, I'd say 3 years. No matter how hard I try to stop it, it never works. But this year I feel is different. I'm in highschool now, away from all the bullshit. I can be the person I've wanted to be for a really long time, not trying to impress anyone. So there it is...some of what I go through in life.  SOME  is the main word. There's no way I could ever explain everything, but I can try. But for now it seems all good, I hope it stays this way. I'm just gonna have to hold on tight, hold on to what I have, and not let it slip away.
