Went to jurong east to walk about in the Cd Shop and splurged money to buy Fan Fan's latest cd...now no money ...how am i going to survive? So also no money to eat lunch so just bought a 70 cents bread...Maybe i should save more cux now i spent more money nowadays on shopping.                  okay...then went bm library orhz...as jurong's is opening only in 5th june...borrowed one chinese book on youth hehe...it talks about the life of a youth-romance,ignorance,etc...then went to band. Just another blowing day,preparation for Macritchie Performance,haiz 2 seniors never come.When J come,X neva come and vice versa~.Y was sick!Again?~take care...nowadays many ppl sick ...perhaps of weather?n that reminds me of The day after tomorrow! i wanna watch it again n again! Maybe i buy the VCD? i Saw the Book in Kinokuniya! still,the movie is better than book right...hehe never mind...                  Yea`reached home at 5 pm...tired...listening to FanFan's Cd...Superb...it's full of heart-felt songs. Full of emotions,other cds only talk about Romance but this talks most of happiness in life like angel and dream ...Zhui Chu De Mong Xiang! And i like singers who compose songs themselves...rather than like some "ppl" only depend on looks n sing horribly yet proud? Lolx...i wanna be a wonderful musician! Can i? i wait... i shall compose n pen my own lyrics yea...~                       I really can't express very well how much i luv music,why?i Dunno...Perhaps perhaps perhaps...Maybe because some songs are ways of communicating and heart-felt themes...Describes my feelings and mood and life...Though,it's some sort of weird? not weird i should say...it's because i seems to like music my friends don't...they like Jolin,Jay..lalala...haha ....and i dun really...it's okay la.                 Hmm...kinda hot now...drink water? Yea i should cux jus now drank lots of soft drink must use pure water to replace...later got diabetes?   kekeke...lolx!                  Tomorrow i stay at home and slack...yea cux these few days quite busy orhz then no time to rest...today i met the neighbour's friend again...we dunno each other..he's bout my age? not sure or perhaps younger than me...but he always has the weird sight when seeing me come out of lift n that's where i always see him...opps..?No nothing...prefer guys taller than me hehe lala! Ok ok...continue to pursue my dream! :D                 *gave brownie a kiss on the nose*
