He is an intelligent, perceptive and fundamentally decent person. During all the time I knew him he was open-minded and didn't let differences of opinion turn into personal dislike, unlike many people all over the world with passionate beliefs.  His time in Australia changed the way many of us thought about America and I think we have changed him as well.  As Neal said, the reason for so many global problems right now is fundamentalism of any sort, where people close their minds and resort to violence. The fact that Neal was able to reflect about his own beliefs makes me respect and admire him as much as anyone I know. He was a funny guy, a good friend to all of us, and could maintain an argument when drunk (Unlike Max, who tried to justify the Vietnam War).  I hope he enjoyed his send-off at Phillip Island, and that life treats him well back in the heartland of America.  Admin. OK APC considering you are effectively anonymous and most of your comments are offensive i'm giving you until tuesday to reveal your identity, if you do not all your posts will be deleted. And also whoever this is does not understand the purpose of this site. m3r is a forum for all different political views to be expressed, except for of course fascist ones such as yours cryptofascist however is allowed. I don't know what i'm saying but Peter has the full support of the m3r community and until you reveal your identity APC you have none.
