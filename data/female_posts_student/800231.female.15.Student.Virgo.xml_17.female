Any sane person wouldn't make a big deal out of this. Not me, I started fucking crying earlier. For some reason I have HUGE issues with the whole procedure. Everything about it is hideous. The fact that an IV needle is involved scares me even more. Isn't there just something freaky about having your body pumped full of drugs to make you lose consciousness? My wisdom teeth haven't even erupted yet, meaning that the surgeon has to saw through my gumline and jaw to get the teeth out... The *best* part is, this is in NO way a necessary procedure. The three teeth that are developing are coming in perfectly straight and have enough room. My orthodontist is just being an arse. Even my dentist said this wasn't needed but he seems to think he knows better. Fucking A... I may just run away, I don't need to waste my entire mid-winter break being puffy and in pain.   My parents seem to think I'm superior to other humans because I only grew three of the bloody things... Right, if I was more evolved I wouldn't have developed them at all. Would've saved myself a lot of pain. Anyway, Alice called me a few minutes ago to assure me that I wouldn't die. Like she knows anything.   I'm only 15, I'm to young for this. I despise my orthodontist... He's just doing this to be mean. I'm glad I bit him when I was eight. He deserved it.
