"lets talk about issues that you deal with everyday"... but without Tom and Katherine there... there's no back-up and there's alot of empty dissucsion.  They come back soon though so hopefully it will get better.  After SS Kayli and I ran upstairs to practice bells.. then downstairs to sing the prelude ect... then back up stairs after the sermon.. then back downstairs to sing for the closing... wow.  My friends all deserted me after church so I am now here... waiting for my chicken soup to cool (which i accidentally boiled) so i can eat it.  I am so bummed... I thought for once i would be the only one in the family not to catch the cold.. but i think one is sneaking up on me.  Back to everyone deserting me, thanks guys.  I always get the feeling i'm just a third wheel with them sometimes.  Or now that all four of them are at Wash. a 5th wheel i guess.  Oh well.. I've always got my friends at school and Kayli's always gonne be there for me... luv ya guys.  My soup is done so I'm going to eat it, soup is delicious.  Now don't you worry, I still have Crossroads tonight and considering the path that this day is taking.. i'm sure  something  interesting will happen.
