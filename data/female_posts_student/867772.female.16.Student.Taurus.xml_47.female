THANK YOU JOYCE.  Nina, Cassie, Joyce and I went to Fun n Games a few nights later. The car ride there was spent making jokes about coming home with eight-year old boyfriends after spending our night at an oh-so-mature arcade. Once we got there we wasted money in those Wheel of Fortune "games", and played a few rounds of air hockey. We played those Anti-Zombie plastic-gunned games and drove around what was supposed to resemble Las Vegas in "cars". Nina and Cassie didn't want to play laser tag (which mas the main reason why I went- it has to be the only game in the world that can compete with football.) After being begged for an hour they agreed to play, and they didn't regret it at all. We took part in that masochistic Adams Family game, where you hold your hand on the handles and electrocute yourself. Sounds fun, huh. I had exactly 40 tickets, which was enough to buy a pink football. Im tellin' you, everybody needs a pink football.  I spent the rest of the night in the photo booth with my girls (taking pictures, pervert), falling off tables that otherwise  would  make good beds (non-purposely, believe it or not), and throwing my precious pink football at people's heads.   We spent the car ride home talking about the hot guy who worked there and looked  exactly  like Keanu Reeves. Damn...  The morning after that we went down to B. Field and played football. I may hate Christmas, but I think I've fallen in love with Christmas vacation.
