I hope he does not get mad at me for telling everyone what he did for me. It is a long story but, when Ian and I used to date a couple of years ago. The first song that we kissed to was an odd one; the song was called  Push Me, Pull Me  by  Pearl Jam.  As we were talking on the phone I started to hear a song in the background on Ian's end of the line. I asked him what was happening over there and the song got louder and he wished me a happy birthday. I never thought you would remember that, thank you Ian.    Ian thought I was getting sad again, because I was crying a lot. But, it was because was very romantic andI was just sohappy. So Ian doesn't have to worry. After I finished speaking with Ian, Adam also gave me a nice birthday cake and gave me a present. WhenI opened it up I found a copy of Harvest Moon, for Super Nintendo. I have been looking for a copy of this game forever and now I have it. I think this is one of my best birthdays I have ever had.    Thank you Ian and Adam.
