The second I walked in the door--gasp!--a call from the distant friend I've been jonesin' for...and what seemed like virtually endless harassment from my Mom throughout the entire call. A pox on the man that invented the speaker phone that allows my parents to pick up undetected on any call (which of course is then blasted at high volume throughout the first floor of our house) and hollar in media res into whatever conversation they like. Faak.    Luckily, my golden knight showed up--although, sadly, I was nowhere near done my conversation, and even more sadly I wanted nothing more than to get the faak outta the nuthouse I call home.    The plan was pizza and a flick. The "plan" didn't happen quite that way.  "You feel like a beer or two?"  "Don't I always? What's the catch?"  "You feel like going and hanging out over at Jordan's place for a little while?" Hmm... Jordan, part of the original group from the Maddy; not a bad guy, but friends with Tom, so I'm always a little suspicous of where his loyalties are.  "Yeah, OK, Jordan's it is."    **************************************** Saturday was a blast. I slept late...I slept late after Mike dropped me off, because he told him slave-driver of a boss that he'd work (!!!), which I guess was ok. Ally and I went to mall, and I got a super-cute little mini-skirt. Yow. Hopefully it had a  Mike, don't work on the weekends sort of sex-appeal . Read on for the answer.    Mike's best-friends Matt (aka Ches) and Trev (aka T-Luck) have little neat little house in the (student?) ghetto of St. Catharines (is St. Kitt's anything but a ghetto???) Whatev. Anyway, we chilled out there for a few hours. Drank beers. Many beers. Tossed around the ball. No, really. It's been a while since I've hung out with intensely male guys -- Mattee doesn't quite count, because, afterall, he is "Met" Mattee -- and they are really, really... uh, GUYS. Have I mentioned, ever, just how absolutely gorgeously cute Mike is? 'Cause perhaps I should mention that in conjunction with a little bit of a boast about jumping him (and that's molesting, not robbing,) when he went upstairs to get changed. Yeah, no really, I was going upstairs to get changed too. Ahem. I might have been a little more reserved if I had realized how damn sweaty I was gonna get 20 mins before we had to leave for this bar, but...meh. And it was worth it, yowsa! Talk about blowing off steam!    We went to this place called My Cottage -- a bar in Port Dalhousie that's like 80% patio. Really. "What the heck do they do in the winter?" I asked. The answer: it's only open from the May 2-4 to Labour Day weekend, or something fucked up like that. My Cottage is right on the water, so people literally dock at the bar. Nutso-smasho. And the place was bouncing! They had a pretty decent DJ, and the crowd was really, really good. Matt  Trev tried --unsuccessfully-- to pick up, but had a good time with us nonetheless. I got an indecent proposal from one of the hottest girls I've ever seen. Nothing came of it, there's just no reason to give any guy anything to jerk-off to later. I don't know why Matt  Trev can't seem to find THE GIRL.    Matt keeps going for friends that he already has, and can't understand why they only see him platonically; Trev keeps going for girls that have boyfriends. I can sort of understand the double-pull conundrum they're in: the desperate want to be with someone (or just the blanket fear of being alone) and the serious contract-clause of not wanting to waste time with the wrong one. Before we left the house, I walked into the living room to find Mike and Matt having a conversation about love and relationships. I overheard enough to hear Mike talking, or boasting is more like it, about finding me.  "You just gotta be patient. There are more than enough roadblocks that will pop up in any relationship, so you just have to take it easy. I mean, five years, man. That's a lot to contend with. [This is when I walked in.] But it's worth it, man, it's so worth it if she's the one for you."    Awwwww!    Mike is a fantastic dancer. I have never dated a guy who danced before. I love it! We just mesh so well. He's a fantastic friend and I am sooo attracted to him. He's so confident and self-assured, but totally lacking in conceit. Trev was eyeing this group of girls and was agonizing over how to talk to them, so Mike just called them over. Yup, just like that. Of course, really the girls got fooled by the old bait-and-switch: I could tell almost immediately that having another girl there (me) was not helping Trev's chances of talking to these chicks. So I told Mike, who was being fiercely chatted up by several of these girls, that I was going to grab another beer. He gave me a big sweet kiss, and you better believe I looked back as I walked away. Yep, those little chiquitas were not happy that he wasn't as available he had first seemed. When I got back with my beer, most of the girls were gone. Ha!    It's really the little things, the little ego-stroking things that endear him. Like the way that he whispers in my ear that I'm the most beautiful girl, or the way he completely ignores his friends when he's just staring into my eyes. Oh, gosh, am I blushing???    All things said, we had a fantastic time at this bar, and I got just loaded! I tried to remember on Sunday morning just how many I had had -- I put in the range of about 8 or 9. A lot for little me. We caught a cab home, and Matt started up with talk about "Emilio". As in, "Mag--when we get home, you've gotta meet Emilio."  "Who's Emilio?" our very young, hip cabbie asked.  After some chuckling, "Emilio is our giant bong, man."  "Well, I don't normally do this, but you guys seem pretty cool. I keep a bit with me--my work stash--to smoke when it gets a little dull late into the night."    And I'll be a monkey's uncle if this super-cool cabbie, Paul, didn't smoke us on two of the dopest joints I've had in a while. Sitting in the backseat, I was fourth out of five to get passed to, and looking at this piddly joint, I didn't think it would make it around for a second pass. I got completely fucked. This was some of the most serious dope I've ever had. And this was the coolest cabbie I've ever had. We laughed and laughed until I thought we were all gonna die. Buddy gave us his card, and told us to call him sometime.    "Paul, seriously, you are the coolest guy. You know where we live now, so anytime you wanna come over, like on breaks on your shift, whatever, just come on by. We won't forget you!" Matt was seriously ready to pin a poster of this guy to his wall and start worshipping!    Later,Matt  I went to the 7-11 and had a little bonding moment. He called me "Mag" and freaked out about it at first. "Oh, shit. Can I call you that, is that ok?"  "Matt, I mean Ches, I'd be hurt if you didn't call me that!"    Mike passed out sooo easily. He went upstairs while we were smoking our third joint of the night, and I thought for sure he was talkin' to God on the big white telephone. But nope, he was passed out in the first bedroom he walked past. Sunday morning I was in rough shape. Went out onto the back deck just before 8am, wanting some fresh air. Fertilized the plants while I was out there, too. I hope puke doesn't kill plants. Meh, whatev. When I got back upstairs, Mike was bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.    "I'm just gonna grab a quick shower and then we can go."    Go? I was really unsure of whether or not a car-ride right then was gonna be a good thing, but if Mike was ok to drive, I would have much prefered his bed to this stranger's bed. It was a rough ride, but we made it back to his place without incident and slept until almost 2 o'clock. The rest of our Sunday was just so sweet. We lounged around in bed, chatted and laughed. Went out for a late lunch-early dinner. Then Mike passed out again for a few hours! At about 8:30 when he woke up again, we went outside and had a little bonfire. We played with the horses, got extremely muddy. Then he took me back to bed, carrying me hero-style.    This guy, oh my. Mike has made me forget about a lot. Maybe too much. And maybe I should think about that a little bit...and then share it with the world in my next post.
