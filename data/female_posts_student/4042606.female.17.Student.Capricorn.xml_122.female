You wouldn't believe how excited Ian is, it's to bad that I won't be able to see her though, maybe they will take pictures to send me. I really would like to see her again. She was actually one of the people whom introduced Ian and I. After we were done hanging out with Ian and Rich that night we all went back to Rich's house. Abby was there and that is where we saw Ian really talk. That is how I kind of got a little crush on Ian. So in a way Abby caused Ian and I to start dating. She was happy about it too, when she found out we started dating. She was also really upset when she found out we were breaking up before we all went our separate ways. Ian asked me to explain why Abby is called "Spinner", I usually don't call anyone by their nickname when I write, because it is confusing for people sometimes. I do though call people their nicknames when I am talking to them though. I just wanted to clear that up, so people didn't think I was weird or something. The story of "Spinner" is very cute, and I think everyone will like it. I was not there when she was first being called "Spinner". I guess there was just one event that gave her the nickname "Spinner". The reason though that she has that nickname is because her mood would reverse really fast without anyone knowing. It is hard to explain, like we could be having the worst day on earth and all of us in a really sad mood, including Abby. Abby, would all of a sudden become extremely happy, like her mood would just spin around. She would then cheer everyone up. That is the easiest way of explaining why Abby was called "Spinner".
