I should probably be in bed, but my neck hurts like a bitch in heat. horrible I know. My ear is screwed. gaia is screwed...well for the time being. it tends to go all bad when I am on it. It doesnt help that I am still fighting off whatever I am getting. gaah....head trauma. I probably have that. my head is very fucked.  I need to sharpen my knife. it is really dull...and I dont really use it for that much. just the odd thing or two. this has taken me a really long time to type. lol. it normally doesnt take this long to type so much. I keep getting kick off the computer. *sigh* I like to whine. *nods agreeably* I should probably just go to sleep now. I really probably should. I havent showered today. I feel gross. lol krys is "sleeping"  in a asquat position with her head on the back of the chair. she looks funny. :) we both smell like smoke. but thats what we get for playing with the fire. lol now she looks like a squirreal. she stuffed half of a marsh mallow in her cheek, but thats just like her. sooo soooooorrrreeeee....it is going to be really warm in the camper. lol. it is really a scamper. I like scamper better than camper. mhmmm yup I do. I hope the fuse in the scamper isnt blown..oh well it just means no light...well enough babbiling cause I am outta here. good night all.
