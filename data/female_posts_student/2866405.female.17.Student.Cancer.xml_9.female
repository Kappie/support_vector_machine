And hey this is what i come up with. Inspired my an ex love at the time love really sucked  A MODERN DAY ROMEO AND JULIET  A modern day Romeo and Juliet, what a joke. There will never be such a thing for is anyone in today’s “modern” selfish world, selfless enough to believe in a love that will precede life in itself and give up	all future years of aspiration for the off chance that nothing great will ever happen again because their so called “true love” is not by their side? If you ask me, or anyone else around me not caught up in the dream themselves. NO CHANCE. Love is simply overrated… just like sex. You spend you’re the  whole of your younger years looking forward to some fairytale, get to where you begin thinking about it and find yourself  in the unfortunate situation too early… then arising with the wisdom that you could only dream that you had a minor part beforehand. And before too long its all your life is revolved around… what a drag.   Yet another fairytale from your childhood that can and will be shattered in an instant. Then in less than a year your life could feel destroyed. Not knowing what direction your life is heading in, what corners will confront you or whether you make the right decision in the forks lying ahead in the road. Throughout it all in later years it is all but too depressing to reminisce those teenage years because in the years you are destined to make some of the biggest and hardest decisions of your life. You are also persuaded by the pressure that these will be your last few years of freedom. To be free from restrictions, for being either too young or too old, Too young to comprehend anything which in some form has a major significance in the world or too old with too many responsibilities. Over the phase where the world is “at your feet” And apparently by the way they react over the little things, having the weight of the world on their shoulders. Yet in theory and practice, the time of tender kisses, arising maturity and the apparently carefree and joyous times of experimentation seems to be the hardest to get through, but in the same context the most enjoyable. Which brings me back to Romeo and Juliet. Why? Why is it that in the midst of everything else going on do we have to love? To fall in love with someone who may or may not love you as deeply as they claim, but if it is, not understanding when and how you would like it placed. Again this refers back to the selfish views we, as modern civilians have today. But ask yourself are there  any other perks to “love”, is their any point in it if the only gratification we get is knowing that we love and are loved in return? I ask myself sometimes why that isn’t enough, or even sometimes why it is. But really there is no possible answer for there is no logical, mathematical, or even rational explanation to love. The only conclusion I can make is that I wish the world was all it seemed that short year ago. Happy, carefree and even in love with nature and the manufactured demise of the heavens. The world is forever changing…wish in my mind I could decide whether I like love, what love is and even if in any way I would ever want to be as stupid as  Romeo and Juliet.
