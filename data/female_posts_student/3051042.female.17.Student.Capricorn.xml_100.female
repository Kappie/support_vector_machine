I look back upon today and the things I accomplished and the things I fucked up and I realize that I was so alone. True I did see David after school, and we talked for awhile. I gave him a ride home. But as for work and the p.net party hour, that was sorta fun. I hadn't been in a chat room for years up until today. Oh! And I'm a 22-year-old, Swedish model with a hermaphroditic twin sister. Forgot to tell you that. Riiight.  At any rate. I got out of work, and Donald helped me out on my English final. Yes, he actually did something besides feel me up! It's AMAZING! jk jk. He never reads this anyway. And if he does... HI! Oh well. Tomorrow is the last day of school. My grades are up, my English take home is not even half way completed, but I'm doing alright. I'm going to pass out at my computer. But I'm doing just fine.  My emotional state has been put on hold. I've had WAY too much caffeine to care right now. But it's not like it's gone away completely... I can feel it lingering in the background, waiting for a time when I'm not busy so it can sneak up behind me and terrify me with some kind of mental breakdown. Like after I got done talking with Mrs. Otwell at school today. That was so completely random. Donald called me and asked for coffee so I was driving out of the parking lot, and I'd just gotten off the phone when I just started crying. I stopped myself though. I don't have time to cry. I don't have time to care. I just have time for other people... I don't need time for myself. I'll be okay. God, I don't need this when I still need to finish my stupid final exam... okay, I'm leaving now.  G'night... hopefully I'll get some sleep. I'm going to go raid refrigerators for more caffeinated beverages.
