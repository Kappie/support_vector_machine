Most unforgettable camp memory so far? Last night campfire, it was probably in the low 40's in temperature so I gave up my sweatshirt and long sleeve shirt to the little girls next to me leaving me in shorts and a short sleeve sweatshirt :( However, I had a little girl curled up in my lap and one on each side with my arms around them, trying to keep them all warm. It would have been miserable, except as I was trying to distract them by singing "Lean on Me" softly and rocking them, Shelbi- the little girl wrapped in my sweatshirt in my lap- looked up at me and whispered in my ear, "You're the nicest person I've ever met" and then proceeded to fall asleep on me, snoring softly. I think right then and there I have never felt so fulfilled...so this post is dedicated to my little children, all 19 of them....may you always be loud, and crazy and just the little girls you are meant to be...  ::I've grown up they've told me Into someone repectable who never crosses the line I used to be just like you love A runner and singer Dancing in tune to shaken heads and tsk tsk tsks I might have grown up I might have grown old But in the end love I refuse to die cold::
