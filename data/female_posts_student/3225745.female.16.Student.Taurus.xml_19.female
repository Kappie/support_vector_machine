Not just because he is a hilarious smartass, but because he informs so many dim-witted people.  If it were not for Stewart, so many average Joe's would not know we were in a war right now.  He tells the truth, then makes fun of it.  What more could you ask for.  John Stewart reminds me of another man.  Dennis Miller. Not that well known but is a fucking genius.  Plus he is also a smartass and can make fun of the world.  So for those who want to be informed about the world but find regular news stations a bore, then check these out:                    1.The Daily Show with John Stewart on Comedy Central (cable 53)                   2.The Dennis Miller Show- CNBC (cable 50)  These shows really give you a great perspective on today's world events.
