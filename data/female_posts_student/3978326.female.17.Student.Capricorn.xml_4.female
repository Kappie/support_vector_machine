I had to put on hold a bunch of sentences for my biology lab report just to grab that idiotic piece of equipment which was on my dressing table. Dragging my sticky body after my jog around the nearby park, I reluctantly pressed the button with a green coloured receiver on it. Just before I did, I recieved an impulse from my brain..    Brain : You are avoiding the number that ends with 28..    When I took a peek at the blue screen of my bloody NOKIA I saw 82 at the end of the number.    Brain : You scape-grace of a fool BoNdI, was it 28 or 82 you were avoiding?..      Unable to decide, with the failure of my brain memory system, I reluctantly pressed a button with an emblem of green receiver tarnishing its silvery hue.  Unknown : Hello?..................Hello?   Brain : Think, think, THINK! Is that the voice you are avoiding?    Me : I don't know, it's kind of deep, that voice I heard...... wasn't deep. It had the pitch of a    woman's...   Brain : Don't say anything. Just be silent.   Me : WHAT! Leave the voice to entertain itself....okay....I really can't decide..   I then pressed the complimentary button with a red reciever emblem.  Almost immediately, the phone rang again..   Me : I'm going to pick this up. And if it's that the salesman that sent me a very weird message,   I shall just say wrong number...    Brain : WAIT you mutt!    Unknown : Hello Me : Hello? Unknown : Is this BoNdi? Me : Yes... Unknown : I'm your doctor.   Brain : MAYDAY-MAYDAY! ALERT! ABORT PHONE CALL! ABORT!   Me : Huh? Huh? euh...euh....I think you got the wrong number....   Brain : ABORT! You want to talk to a maniac selling, god knows what? ABORT!   Unknown : No, this is BoNdI, right? Me : Yes , (oh gosh, what am I DOING?)  Unknown : I'm your family doc. I'm returning your call on the rabies you contracted?   Brain :   See. SEE! GO ON TALKING SOMEMORE! SEE WHAT YOU DID. THAT DUMB      MANIAC IS SAYING YOU HAVE RABIES NOW. AND GUESS WHAT, YOU JUST     WROTE AN INCRIMINATING ARTICLE ABOUT A DOG! HE'S STALKING YOU!   Me : HUH? Unknown : Remember a dog bit you..   Brain : BoNdI, BoNdI! It's  urlLink YingKs!  YingKs!   Me : YingKs! YINkS! What the hell, you scared me like shit! CRAP YOU! OH MAN!! YingKs! : hahahahahahhah  Emotionally tested, I was really tired after conversing with YingKs!. He gave me a pointer when avoiding someone. Instead of relying on your brain,    Brain : Hey, what the heck! I'm the one that helped you ace....      save the number and name it as DANGER. Don't delete it and apply some memorize the last two digits technique.
