If he was fit then hey ;) but no.  And I'm too shallow to fancy a guy for any other reason.  (I'd hate to imagine my husband.  He'll probably be a right bastard and abuse me or something, but he'll be stinking rich and look  really  good in all his designer outfits.)   I'm am being so catty with Clare!  And then she goes and corrects my spelling.  What a bitch!  I can spell words wrong if I fucking want to spell words wrong.  So fuuuuuuck you. Bitch.  Ha, I don't even care if you find this.  Biiiiiiitch.  Bitch.  BIIIIIIITCH.  I'm seriously going ot regret that at some point or other.  But now, it's all good.  So ...  BiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiTcH!  You bitch about me, and then tell me you haven't bitched about me ever - what's that about?  You could at least be honest, for fucks sake.  I had never bitched about you until this holiday.  But now I feel free to express my feelings.  BITCH.  Okay, I really will regret that at some point or other (so why I'm publishing it now is a mystery to me) so I'll shut up now.  *~Jools~*  Touch, Sean, touch.
