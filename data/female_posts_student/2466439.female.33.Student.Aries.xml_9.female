We ended up doing thirty hours of driving altogether.  I think we will not be doing that again if I have anything to say about it.  I am jobless, of course, which does not help.  I sure would love to have gotten a job for Christmas.  If those temp agencies are as excited as they sound (and they do sound excited) how come they have not called me?  Ah, well.  I guess I will start putting in some more applications at places I have no desire to work for tomorrow.  Times are hard here, though.  I heard they closed another plant.  Blech.
