Alicia and I collaberated and just blackmailed everyone so we could get oodles and oodles of cash since we didn't really care about the mystery.  At the end, since we knew we couldn't win with only our money, we just convinced everyone else to give us their money and we won the award for most wealth since we had like at least 7,000 dollars.  All I got were these stupid blue dice though.  But then Tim started handing out prizes randomly and I got a cap gun/caps!  Yay!  Then when everyone was leaving, everyone was like all like hugging and crying cause his party was probably like the last time they'll ever see some of their friends again since we're all going to different schools.  I was like pretending to be really sad with my fake whiney voice (which I'm very good at by the way) and it was fun.  Lots of hugging.  It was really funny, when Faich was leaving, he knows how homophobic Tim is, so he hugged Tim, and then gave him kiss on the cheek.  Tim was just standing there petrified and was like, ewwwwwwwwww.  And then I started fake whining again, so Tim gave me a hug, and he was like, "I'm gonna give her a kiss to make her feel better" and I didn't think he was actually serious, and then he like actually did give me a kiss and I was like.... eh... and I kind of just stood there frozen for like 5 minutes cause I was not expecting that.  I mean, it's Tim.  He asked me what a hickey was earlier this year.  Bleh.  Before the party Alicia and I went to the mall!  Yay!  We spent like four hours there in a last attempt to get Tim a present, and in the last ten minutes, we just bought one out of desperation.  It's actually really cool and it wasn't that expensive, yet it was very heavy to carry the entire length of the mall and we like switched off who held it every ten feet.  It's a massage chair!  Well actually like a pad that you put on a chair and it massages you.  It was only 50 dollars, and on sale from 100 dollars, so we only had to pay 25 dollars each.  Totally awesome.  And he really liked it considering we were like the only people who didn't buy him a gift certificate.  We kind of told people at the party that it was just a gift certificate in a giant box, and they believed us.  It was fun.  That's about it for now.  ...la Gu
