If its not rainy after work today I'm going to go to the highschool and walk a mile.  I am dreading this, but my waistline says I must.    I saved the office from being stuck smelling the stinky guy...Yankee candle company makes room spray and it works and smells yum!  Today is bring your daughter to work day.  The irony is that I'm here at work, while my mom is relaxing at home on her week off.    eBay is crack to me, although thankfully I've been outbid on most everything so I don't have to spend the acutal money.  Boz posts a lot.
