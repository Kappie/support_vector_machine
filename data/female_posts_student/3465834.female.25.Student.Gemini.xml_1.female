So I had this really weird dream last night, I dreampt that Kim and I went shopping to this wicked store it was sort of half skater half preppy but everything was exspensive and gorgeous.  I ran into Dave Fauteaux there and some other random's that I recognised, I brought my 35 mm camera and started taking pictures of everyone while also stealing clothes?  For the record, Kim stole a brown leather jacket for me and I stole a bunch of stuff for her...  Does that mean I'm a thief or a photographer?  Perhaps it just means, I need to do some serious shopping.  Well not today, today I have the pleasure of sitting in the library.  Boyz...  hmm, went on a date with Claudio, he seemed nice, we are supposed to go out again tonight, but I'm going to have to rain cheque because I want to stay at the library till it closes, I have to get my ass in gear, its already mid-term time - I mean seriously, holy fuck, where did all the time go?  I do however have to call Jason, I keep forgetting and by the time I remember I dont want to call because its to late, I hope he doesn't think I'm a shit for not calling for so long.  We'll just have to wait and see I guess.  Alright, I've discovered a wonderful way to procratonate, perhaps one of the best is by blogging...    I still haven't told anyone about the web site address and I'm debating really who to tell.  Will I make this more like a dictionary or a blog?  I think a blog is my best bet cuz when you start digitalizing your skeleton's, I'm sure only bad can come from that!!!  Till next time Tonto...???  WTF?
