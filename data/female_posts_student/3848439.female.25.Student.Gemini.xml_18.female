Why do I not see you all the time? Through my eyes, I find you hard to find. Should I go and seek to search another place? Tell me where oh Lord to look to find your face.  And why do I not hear you all the time? When I pray I listen for a sign - But my own voice it echoes in my heart. Tell me how to tell the two apart.  Tell me why I question all the time. Why small doubts still linger in my mind But as I seek so also shall I find For I know that you are faithful all the time.  For I know that you are faithful all the time.
