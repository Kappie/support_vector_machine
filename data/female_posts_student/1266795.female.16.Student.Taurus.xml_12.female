Just two more days and we're going to be juniors. it's unbelievable.  exams this year seem so hard. i do'nt have anything tomorrow so that's why i have time to write in here. i've updated my profile too if you wanna check that out. i didn't realize this till today, but it said that i was a male in it...i just laughed!!! but it's all changed now. i realize that i didn't really say anything bout myself and i just started writing but you'll pretty much read about me in the profile.  as for the finals though, french was amazingly hard.  I was guessing my through the last part of it so i really do hope that she just takes that section out.  i know i did really badly even though i'd like to think i did well, but that's just not happening. but i'm not really caring anymore. school is over in two days and summer is going to start.  i'm looking forward to it so much even though i don't even have anything planned. i guess i'll enjoy not having to do homework and waking up at 7 in the mornin'!  to answer's ashley's translation of Altius, Fortius, Citius...to show you how bored i am, i actually went online and looked up the meaning of these three words and came up with "Swifter, Higher, Stronger". If that's wrong, blame yahoo.com, lol.  Less than two days to go!!!  I GOTS EARS!!!!!
