Comparing my favorite game with a crazy clown to my favorite show with a clown who is dating a blonde "male" creature.   As I sat I thought about all the ways they were similar and, suprisingly, they were very much the same....(conspiracy!!)   TM: Black's storyline: play as a crazy person who may or may not have committed various crimes, seek revenge for something, or have serious mental issues. Gundam Wing's storyline: 5 crazy boys with traumatic pasts have to go around committing crimes to seek revenge for something, or just because they have serious mental issues. TM: Black's goal: to kill everyone else so that they can win a wish!! Yes this sounds lame but they have really sadistic wishes.... Gundam Wing's goal: kill all the members of OZ so they can get their er.... wish of peace I suppose. Well, It's a wish, ain't it?   Heero Yuy: he killed a little girl and her doggie and so now he's traumatized. Is stalked by Relena Darlien/Peacecraft/Yuy/ whatever and he threatens to kill her. Heero is 'the perfect soldier' so he's kind of  cold killing machine. TW counterpart: Outlaw: a cop who killed a little girl so now he is traumatized. May or may not be stalked by Sweet Tooth, who threatens to kill him. Is also a cold killing machine, though he really doesn't realize it yet.   Duo Maxwell: some hyper-ass who enjoys talking and having pretty hair. He also enjoys killing and is Death incarnate. Has many many many fangirls who want to run their hands through his long, silky hair. XD Has no parents and is a orphan who was brought in by the church but then the church was bombed (I think...-.-;;) TW counterpart: ....uh I dunno! Duo is pretty original. There is the church man who drives Brimstone... in some ways he could be compared to him... but not really =.=  Quatre Rabinna Winner: an adorable little blonde boy who really doesn't like killing, but kills anyways. He's most definitely the classiest Gundam boy (we ain't counting the OZ peeps) and he likes TEA!!! (personally I only like really sweetened ice tea, but that's just me) He seems to be the shortest cuz everyone else is so tall and intimidating. His mommy was killed giving birth to him. :'( TW counterpart: as creepy as it is, Yellow Jacket: a little boy who is really smart. He hangs out with his daddy a lot... even though his dad is dead. The little boy re-animated the corpse. So he isn't much like Quatre but he has the adorable blonde kid thing working for him.  Trowa Barton: He's quiet. He's a clown. He has some memory issues if I remember correctly. And his hair is kinda weird. TW counterpart: Sweet Tooth: evil clown who kills things and his head is on fire. So he has wierd hair. If he ain't Trowa I dunno who is!!  Wufei Chang: He's kinda ugly. He's kinda mean, but he wuvs his dead wife("THIS CONCEPT OF WUV CONFUSES US!!!" -Futurama) Wufei is chinese so they gave him a wierd nose. This is probably why they made him so ugly, just because he is Chinese.... :'( TW counterpart: Junkyard Dog: A ugly dude with a screwed up nose, who constantly mourns over his dead wife. Junkyard Dog is a hick.  Relena Darlien/Peacecraft/Yuy/oh who gives a s***?! : Can you say "Peace and love"? And not the good kind of Peace and Love that Vash preaches? A blonde lady who is in love with Heero and thinks that he loves her back. (I dunno if he does or not.) She dislikes the war and wants peace forever(Feh. PEACE IS THE QUICK BREAK THAT THE NATIONS NEED TO REGROUP BEFORE THE NEXT WAR!!!)  TW counterpart: Bloody Mary: a chick who is always sad because the one guy she ever liked rejected her. She went into serious denial and ran around killing people who got married. She is very sure that her one true love is just playing hard to get so she chases after him. (although is Relena ran around killing people I would have a much higher opinion of her!)  Mood of the Day: Sugar high Bishie of the Day: Nick D. Wolfwood.
