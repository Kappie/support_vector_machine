Today I got on here for approximatly 45 minutes.  Then I went upstairs and got in momma's bed and I was asleep in minutes.....I got up at 8 something and I was still feeling drowsy and blah.  School stinks, but I do enjoy it while I'm there!  The new "freshy-freshs" (as Ryan would say...;) lol) came to the school today....I didn't see any cuties....the only ones I Know of are John Combs....my hommie, and Drew....LMAO...but he aint a cutie! :P lol jk with ya! Man, its gonna suck with all yall being at our school! not really but oh well! :D now I'm gonna make your little lives hell! jk jk jk...im too much of a nice person to do something like that! well....atleast I say I am!  Have a good one
