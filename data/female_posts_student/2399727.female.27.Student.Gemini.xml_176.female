Yesterday's fiasco :  I arrived 20 minutes early at the test centre to write my exam and was informed that I had been given the wrong location, and I was to report to a library about 10 minutes away.  Slightly ruffled but having not completely lost it (yet), I ran like hell and found the library to check in to write my test.  Upon reviewing my accommodations, the most critical of which are enlarged print and halogen lighting, Invigilator A informed me that this location was not equipped with extra lighting and therefore I would have to make due with a dark cubby hole with a single flickering fluorescent light, and, oh by the way, my exam was not available in large-print.  (This latter detail was just a repeat of what happened three weeks earlier so I had been expecting that.)  However, already stressed to the max and irritable from the series of mix ups, I angrily informed them that I wanted to lodge a protest and explained that the only reason I write with them is because I am partially-sighted and require these two things or I cannot write the test. Invigilator A called the supervisor who ordered Invigilator B to come to retrieve a halogen lamp (NB: from the location I checked into erroneously to begin with!) and while there, Invigilator B enlarged my test to 11x17 paper.  While I calmed down and waited over half an hour for this entire process to happen, Invigilator A informed me that I am exceptional where their service is concerned.  90% of the students who use the Test Writing Centre are there because of learning disabilities and only require extra time and therefore, the supervisor tends to be extremely sloppy with physical and sensory disabilities and regularly makes mistakes, omits accommodations, and so on.  Invigilator A mentioned that every single time she had been proctoring a large-print exam, only a small-print version had been provided so she had to leave the other students who were writing unattended, enlarge the exam and then return with it so the visually impaired student could begin writing.  Finally, she gently suggested I write a complaint in the hopes that this wouldn't happen at my next test on July 21.  After a long wait, my halogen lamp and large-print exam showed up and I was able to start.  You already read the results (at least of the first section; the second section will be known in approximately two weeks) above.   Update on yesterday's fiasco:   Last night I wrote the letter of complaint, quite polite given my mood, detailing what had happened and asking that my file be marked in some way for future reference that I need special equipment or else I cannot write.  I received the following response from the program supervisor this morning: "I am would like   to apologize for the problems that occurred during your exams and thank you for emailing me to let me know.  I will make a note of this, and will be sure that this doesn't happen again!   Again, thank you for letting me know and we will be sure that this is filed.  I hope that once everything was cleared up and you got writing that everything went smoother.  I can understand how frustrating this was for you and we do apologize.  Best wishes, and thank you for this email!"  We'll see if she really means it or not in three weeks.   The moral of this story:  I suppose the moral would be to follow up everything in minute detail and assume that everyone else on the planet is incompetent.  It never ceases to amaze me that the professor and the department are so helpful and flexible where my special needs are concerned, yet the people who are supposed to be attuned to the needs of those with disabilities, the Accommodations Service, are the least accommodating folks on campus.  More to come...
