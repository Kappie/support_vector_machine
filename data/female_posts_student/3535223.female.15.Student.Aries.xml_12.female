I still have a lot to work on because I suck at driving at this point but my dad's gonna start working with me on the weekends...just cause he's such a freakin' cool dad. But, I took a picture of my permit so you can all see and believe. Because some people are just stupid little doorknobs that think they know all but THEY DON'T!! Ok, later Lauren
