At 1 point it sounded as if som1 had been stabbed in the kitchen- was kind of a shout and a weird noise-lol I don’t realy like  put 2 much about em and simon but ill just say this- I am v hapy at the mo and I cant believe we hav been goin out 10 weeks, sometimes that sounds long (4me) and others it doesn’t at all.
