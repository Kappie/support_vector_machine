I talked to my dad on the phone the other day, and for once we actually talked about something other then hs truck, or his job...it was quite spectaular...nothing like that has ever happened befre...but hey guess what..we get out an hour early today...parent/techer interviews or something, but it's all good, we get out early, so im not complaining...  I have been getting migrains a lot lately...2 this week, one at the start and one at the end...it sucked...and now i notice the chest pains im getting are becomming more severe, and my mom wants to get that checked out..i haven't had any so  far today, but i do get them on my left side, where my heart is, but im hoping its just my boos that hurt, cuz i don't want anything to be seriously wrong, believe me i can't afford that right now, i have to much work to be doing...  My mom has been working hard trying to find a second job because she isn't getting enught hours at safeway..and we need to bring in more money then $50-$120 a week...because there are growing kids in the house that actually need to eat....  My mom has been doing well, the best she can anywayz...whick is hard work in her case...and she joined curves and wants me to join with her, and i think it would be fun...and its for a half and our a day...so itsnot to long..bu i wanna help py for it so i gotta get a job....  oh and just another random note: i saw a dead seagul on the road, got squished by a car, i've also seen one get hit..i was with chris Tuttle, not havin the best of days, and watchin it get hit didn't help any...  write more later  ~Lil' Nicki~
