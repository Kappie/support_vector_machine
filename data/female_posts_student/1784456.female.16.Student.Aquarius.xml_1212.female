But I have nothing to blog about! Aargh, a week off school can really make you bored, but on the pro side, I do have a tv schedule worked out for if I'm ill again! (Yeay!) Arrrgh damn eyes. And they really haven't been open for that long any way, I'm getting a pretty much 12 hour sleeping thing nower days. Geez I feel awful. I might pass out any minute now! Yeay! Actually, waaay too weak *week weak? AARGH!!!* causse I felt too sick for tea. Awsie, poor me! I'm also going crazy, I can probably mentally play my piano piece perfectly by now! (Don't ask) I'm gonna go watch tv, bubi.
