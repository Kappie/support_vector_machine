So to night after going out with my best friend we went to meet this guy again to give him a second chance. After waiting for an hour and half we and he didn't show up we left. On the way home I finally got a hold of him and he didn't understand why I would be upset. How long should you wait for someone to show up. We waited that long because we were playing pool and I wasn’t watching the time closely. Supposedly he was eating dinner all this time. How long does it take to eat? I have never taken more than an hour to eat. If it’s taking you that long your eating way to much food. I will never drive to meet a guy again. The only way I’ll drive for a guy is if we are dating. Boyfriends are one things, but you should never treat someone you don’t even know like this.
