I wrote that while i was mad about someone who was White and who decided to post a really offending message about chinese ppl on a website for chinese.  I never said that.  Sure, some asians and other races can be racist too and i'd be pretty pissed off too if i saw some other racist ppl typing about other races.  This time however, it was a white person against chinese.  Obviously, it's not right to go to a Chinese website and post up a message saying how Chinese ppl are losers and that Whites are "Captain Cool".  Anyone who would even think about doing that to any race is just a plain asshole.  I'm sorry if that text offended anyone.  I wrote that while i was angry and was not careful about where i put my words.  I feel terrible now.  Just like that idiot who wrote stuff on that website.
