I saw this on my computer...   It's The Aniversity of Integrity,   Relentless thoughts of Diversing Dreams,   Feeling the violence of the Ecstasy,   Hearing the Stretching of my Mind,   The Vaguest Fragrance of A vacant bruise,   The Suffered Rotting in the Narrow Noose,   Need Verification Of the Sharpest Pin,   and Your the cause of all this pain I'm in    Let Me Die,    I Pray To God,    I'll Beg,I did my time,    I've done my time,   All hope is lost,    All wishes Failed,   Nailed to the cross,    My face is pail    Fade to Black As The Poison Sinks,   Believe any thought that the hero thinks,   The Angel's Just a Black burned crow Abandoned,   His Halo's as Holy As My heart,   Crumbled Ink And Paper Murdered,   Charred and Scortched Shamelessly,   The Merit Is Not hard to find,   In the beautil torment in her eyes    Let Me Die,    I Pray To God,    I'll Beg,I did my time,    I've done my time,   All hope is lost,    All wishes Failed,   Nailed to the cross,    My face is pail   Bill wrote that, and it occured to me how truly amazing he is at writing lyrics. I mean I've read a lot of good lyrics and poems by people, but his are incredible. They're insane, and the worst part is..is it takes him NO TIME to write it. Sometimes people have to find words to rhyme with it and shit, but everything just comes to him. It's insane...I've heard him freestyle(rapping), and it's soooo insane. I dont think that anyone admires his talent as much as I do. Like, yeah people are like "it's really good" and shit...but I dont think that ANYONE understands the MIND that you have to have to write shit like that. Nobody KNOWS the mind that he has, and the shit that he thinks in his brain to come up with these kinds of lyrics. He is the most intelligent person I know, and I guess I forgot that for a long time until I woke up this morning, and after I read it..I got butterflies in my stomach. But anyway, I'll stop rambling on.  Ashley, I want us to hang out today. I think that Bill, you, and I should all go to the mall and hang out, but...I dont think that will ever happen. I wish that we could all hang out like every day. I'm hoping that when you get on you wont be doing anything today and you'll want to do something with me, but somehow Im doubting it. Of coarse, because I'm always thinking the worst..but, maybe the worst is the truth??  Anyway...It scares me. My dad comes in and wakes me up to give me coffee, and I'm naked. Like...he has SOOO many times, and I've always been covered but what happens if I'm not one time. Wouldn't that be a little weird? I dont know..sometimes I think about wearing clothes to bed, but I get uncomfortable and it's hard to sleep. I guess I'm just weird and wont put on clothes just in case. but eh...he's my dad its not like if he did see anything he'd get a hard on over it. (atleast lets hope not)...but oh well. -My sister and I have been getting along really really good lately. Yes, the one that I've punched and kicked and been grounded many times for hitting. :'(..I never meant to hurt her..I can't control myself sometimes. Which scares me, because I swear that if I had a gun or a knife in my hand and someone made me mad, I dont think that I'd think twice about killing them until after the fact. *sigh*..I think both Bill and I should start to help eachother on that, because some day the two of us are going to end up killing eachother.  Speaking of killing eachother, Bill has been having many many many dreams about killing me. (which is why he wrote those lyrics at the top)...Like, in his dreams, he shoots me...cuts my head off..stabs me...slices me up....and so on and so forth. He says that his dreams are so real to him, that when he wakes up..having me by his side seems like the real DREAM. I didnt really understand untill he explained to me. He asked me if I had to see someone kill him, what it would do to my mind. I said, I'd probably go insane afterwards. And like, he explained that Dream or not..he SEES me die. He FEELS my hair, and my blood when I am dead. He says that in his dream when he is holding my lifeless body in his arms it seems like its real. I guess that would kind of suck, especially if he's the one killing me. Oh yeah, and it's accidental by the way. I've been trying to interpret(?) his dreams..but I can't seem to figure them out.  When I was in 5th grade, Amber Pangburn and I went camping together. The two of us got bored so we decided to walk to the 'other' part of the camp. Like, where we knew nobody, and we'd never been there before. We were walking and we saw an open field surrounded by trees. Right in the middle there was a swing set with only two swings. Which was weird, because all the rest had like 6. We dedided that we'd swing on them for a while, until we were ready to go back. We were there for a while, and then these two boys rode up on their bikes and they were harrassing us. Asking us where we lived, How old we were...if we had any brothers or sisters and so on and so forth. Me, being the dumbass that I am started talking to them. Amber wouldnt talk, so I was like "come on amber, talk"...but she wouldnt. I answered Ambers questions for her, because by that time I knew everything her being like a sister to me and all. (I know this is boring, but there's more to it) So anyway....I told these two guys (they were like 17 or 18) that Amber and I had to head back to our camp. They told us that they werent letting us leave. I said "We have to go" and I was like begging them to let us get off, but they refused. Then they started being dumbasses and being like "what's the way out of here?" and we told them, but they went the other way..and we didnt dare move because they werent that far away, and they came back and started circliong the swing set. Amber and I were freaking out by this time. Me being the older one was like "amber its okay, calm down" It being a campground and all, you would think that there were people around..but everyone was gone. So finally they left, thinking that they'd go the opposite way we did because they had a better chance of catching up to us since we were walking and they were riding bikes. They were almost to us when we had no choice but to run into the woods..Somehow Amber and I split up. I was screaming "AMBER!! AMBER!! WHERE ARE YOU!" but I couldnt see her. I had NO idea where the fuck I was going, and I figured neither did she...but I kept running. By this time, I'm sure the boys had stopped, and were just trying to scare us..but I kept running anyway. Somewhere, I did find Amber, and we were both crying. I hugged her so tight, and we went back to our camp. So that's my big amazing story that had no point..  Anyway...so after that I had a dream, and I never put it together until about a couple of days ago. I've had this dream before...and I never knew what the location was until then. Well, not the whole thing, just the swing set. I dont remember what was around us..but I remember that there were these two guys, and they were running around killing all of my friends. (this was the year that I split from all of my friends)..I didn't really care about any of them. But Amber and I were sitting on a swing set (yes...a swing set, which I never put together until a couple of days ago)...Amber and I were sitting on a swing set, and everyone was dead. Amber was scared as hell..and I was trying to comfort her and tell her that everything was going to be okay. All of a sudden...one of the guys (the other one dissappeared)...but, one of the guys came up and stabbed amber in the back while she was on the swing. Not only did he do that, but he slit her throat. I remember seeing Ambers body fall forward onto the stone. I looked up at the person who did it..thinking that I had nothing to lose and that I was going to beat the shit out of the mother fucker. I remember reaching down and picking up a big rock, and I was about to throw it when I looked at the guys face and it wasn't a guy at all...It was me. I guess I figured that it was just a dream but after that is when I lost all of my friends. I was leaving them for guys and so on and so forthe. Maybe that was a sign or something...who knows, but..I know what Bill means now, because I saw Amber die...and when I woke up I cried. I cried for so long. I forgot about it though...and I'm pretty sure that a couple of days later Amber and I got in a huge fight, and she started becomming best friends with Marrah. That's when I lost her for good...and for the next few years, I had to fight for her to have me over instead of Marrah. Even then, Marrah came along.  I used to love Amber. I would have done anything for her...she was like an angel to me. I hate that word, but...I never wanted to lose her. No matter what happened, Amber was always there to help me get back up and start again. I still love her so much, I mean..I'll never ever stop loving her. I would have married that girl if I could have..just so that I knew she'd never leave me. Although, I decided to let her go, and get on with life. She still has growing up to do, and she doesnt know who she is..and that hurts me. I figure that if she misses me, she'll come back to me. (which we all know wont happen) I hope that she knows that I'd still do anything for her. I'd kill for her.  Anyhow..I'm rambling...and I hope that nobody actually stays to read this..because that was all just pretty much to myself. To remind myself that I do really care...I'm not just a heartless bitch. I'm so tired...but like........I can't sleep. Grr....Ashley, when you wake up IM me..and tell me what you're doing today. Maybe we can hang out or something..IF you want to.  I have to go call Bill and tell him not to ignore his dreams.  Bye bye
