LOL I know that may sound nasty to you but I am feeling particularly *%$#! as of now. LOL that was a joke and I don't want to end up treating anyone. Like Jen Lin would say (and this is a joke so don't call Scotland Yard Mikey), "Don't mess with me cuz I'm running out of places to hide the dead bodies." LOL. A particularly funny quote by Margaret Cho, (a Korean-American comedian?): "If men had periods, every bachelor apartment would look like a murder scene." Isn't that, in a way, true? I am so not anti-men though...
