My grandfather is a rare exception, he's a Jew who became rich from  the exercise of gay men (for the most part.) He recently sold his magazine company, which had begun to flag, and is slightly out of sorts. No wonder, he had started his bushiness from scatch and devoted his life to it, and now it's in the paws of some slimy yuppie.  I used to be fat until two years ago when I went to THE WORST FUCKING BOARDING SCHOOL ON EARTH. Bye bye trust fund. Up in lake placid, it was -30*F in the daytime for two solid weeks. We spent a fortune in long underwear.  The food was so shitty and it was so hard to stay warm the pounds melted. I became so thin (99 lbs. From 120) They declared me anorexic and kept "an eye" out on me, which meant I could not eat salad. Really.  I don't have strong self-destructive tendencies (like my then-pal, 13 year old R, who said she fucked men anytime she wanted to at home). The strangest thing I do is that sometimes I'll go outside (or in the house when I'm alone) and breath as fast and as deeply as I can unlil I almost or hypervenilate. I like the tingily sort of feel it gives me, and I'm sure it's harmless.  The art department sucked horribly as well. We had one, sporadic drawing class taught by this mannish woman who knew no one (except ME, dammit) had any interest in developing work, so she gave us beginner exercises out of a textbook. One of the kids could only draw stick figures, and he was so utter daunted one class he put his head on the table and cried. I nearly felt sorry for him, but he was such a little piss-pot I snickered with the rest of the class. It was a rare moment of solidarity among my classmates.
