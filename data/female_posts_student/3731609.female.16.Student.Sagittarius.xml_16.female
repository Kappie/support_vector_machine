My mom used to play them on the way to the beach, on the long trip to Arkansas, and when I heard their voices I would roll my eyes and try to fall asleep.  A few days ago I was humming a song and I realized it was one of theirs.  I pulled out a CD and listened to it and was pretty amazed.  I usually don't listen to this type of music, and there were a few songs that I didn't enjoy, but they were so passionate...intelligent.  I can't stop listening to it...reading the lyrics.  I think my mother is proud.    On another note I went out to Tasty Twist with Ben yesterday.  It was fun...and I think he had a good time.  I wonder how the whole Heather thing is going...we didn't really talk about it.
