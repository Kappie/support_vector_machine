The title is mine, the plot is Brian's -- can you tell?  BTW, thanks for your support Daf!  You are the best!  I owe you BIG time.  I actually didn't realize that the online thing requests needs to be prepaid.  I thought it worked just like my pledge sheet.  We're actually up to $125 (mine) + $120 (Sarah).. I don't know how the other people on the team are doing.  I created a website just for the Bowlmania..  Check it out!   (You get to meet the other members of the team).
