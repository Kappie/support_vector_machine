Tons of folks showed up.(louder then I expected) and the format ran louder than smoothly, though it still needs some tightening.   (If you haven't  noticed, i'm trying to put louder then in as many places as possible. Search Engine fodder, you should try it)  This computer that I'm on is really slow. It crashes everytime I try to look at my blog. Go figure.  Louder next time  Diane
