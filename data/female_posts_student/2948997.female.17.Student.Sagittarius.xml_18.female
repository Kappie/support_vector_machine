And! You can mess with the HTML on here, which is a bonus.  I've had a couple things that have been dancing around in my head, tempting me, just wanting to let the world know whats up. Like grab the world and smack them.  Sometime, I wish that I just wasn't me. I didn't have to deal with my stupidity and what I represent. I don't think I'm a *bad* person, but believe me, I am utterly frustrated with myself.
