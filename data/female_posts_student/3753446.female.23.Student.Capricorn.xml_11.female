How disappointing that people Do not trust each other, love each other, or connect With one another anymore? What is it we are so afraid of that keeps us further frightened And why rely only on pride to bring us happiness When the world contains enough simple beauty to do that on its own I do not want to lose myself in the cold when only I feel warm.   Someone told me they heard their father tell them these three words Only one time during their life What shame is there in affection and passion That we distrust it entirely and have eradicated it from the public sphere The inner anger and frustration of sons around the world Seeking mother figures and open hearts and selfless acceptance Has contaminated daughters too  And now it almost seems the world is flushed with the bitterness We once implored ourselves to hide beneath our smiles In the name of honesty and vulnerability with our inner negativity Have we not made ourselves More vulnerable than we started In the interest of being ourselves Have we not stunted our own growth Man has never been a purely angelic creature Yet so often we strive to lower ourselves to that level Instead of living up to what we were made for   When you don’t care or care too much I use my own heart as a ruler And I psychically predict the future of All our relations By the congruency of our hearts, moment to moment, The enigma of whether we are worthy to pursue In the grand scheme of the world Or if I am again better off alone and hidden As I was before I chose you to bring me out And only after much disappointment, guilt, Chronic self-beratement I am seeing better  How ineffective heart matching is In this world of constant dynamics Because I really cannot, No matter how I try or wish to Change you or improve you or teach you, Unless you ask me Allow me to know you And do not be afraid.   Why do matters of the heart frighten some people? Is it a sign of weakness to them? I do not understand. How else does one realize the true reaches of one’s strength If not through testing their vulnerabilities And reinforcing what they built A weak shield results when never taken to The battlegrounds of life And this is the shield that remains In the secure realm of home, while others  Fight the necessary struggles   This moment  In which I Move This, here, Is the very life I  Live and must This new virgin Moment that has Arrived Decked in splendor Novel beauty Has already Erased The one in which I started This thought And everything That lies before It and now And onwards Onwards to virgin moments   You are an enigma to those who Hold on to our self-control And being of us, I feel your Pain, of losing sight of yourself It was in those efforts to please  Yourself, seek yourself Taken out of hand in your way Of always being Out of control, out of here, now here, now there Nowhere Gone too far, too wrong, too gone And then you were pleased, you found your Semblance of truth, so you thought But you knew It’s the world that the rest of us Choose not to visit Out of perfectly sound reason It’s the song of the sirens You think it is your truth But let me tell you what is true For those who seek escape to eternal bliss To plastic paradise Ephemeral imaginings Unrealized hopes and dreams shattered and discarded In favor of a realistic fictional realm So inward you go, diving and diving, Pursuing the elusive When so much has always been right there in your reach Could you still be you, still be there, deep inside, somewhere The you that we loved and we know, who smiled and cared Illness creates geodes out of perfectly beautiful people But what illness is it if you chose it of yourself So much is said of cures, healing, treatment When the real disease is still what it has always been Disease of the heart At this point, I cannot tell if you are A victim or a burden or a coward or pathetic Even accepting pain as part of life, Of believing in positive reframing, courage And the development of pearls Uncertainty is certain and the gray times of life Are what get me brooding   I never asked for much  Of what I’ve been given Rarely complained about my cheese being moved Except once or twice All my unworthy tears for minor frustration and Self-created problems Dried up the wells That are so inaccessible now When I feel like I should need them most   Ripple effect of tears and frustration Shattered dreams gathered and reglued Old pains and mistakes Brooded over like a cycling record Shame and guilt and pain Needing resolution, with roadblocks In ever foolproof plan Only a fool could block them anyhow The core issues, seen differently in the six sided  Prism reflecting everywhere And nowhere is there clarity of focus A direction in which we all can look and examine While the True Core is missed entirely, surrounding us, Within us, carrying us, What pain can result when Someone does not think thoroughly of the consequences Of their actions And how frightening, self reflection, self-identification For those who are still around   Today I cry inside my heart For all the heart I spent on you The times I played my part So many times I’ve been the hero Rising above my victimization So angry at your puppeteering Of lives bound by the sanctity of family You play us like the characters Of your personal show The rescuer, the evader, the hero, the neglected, the needy How self-centered and manipulative You steal away our true roles The identities we were meant to have And that I was only able to find By leaving you   Porcelain doll woken rudely From slumber to terror In the home where nothing bad happens Her pretty eyes widen in shock A channel of tears pours down her cheeks Carrying in them fear, love, anger, disappointment So much sadness Who sees the porcelain doll? So fragile and tender When the world has become rough And all has turned hardened Who dries the porcelain doll’s tears? Lost innocence is a shame When it is to a young and precious Porcelain doll, crumbling in fear Beauty hidden by confusion
