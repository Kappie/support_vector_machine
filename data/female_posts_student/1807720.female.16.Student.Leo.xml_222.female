Already I have like tons of homework and the teacher told us to expect HOURS of homework.  I am used to doing that anyway though, so it shouldn't be that big of a deal.  Bishop Grandin is a really old school though and like there aren't many windows.  That school is like ancient but I have a really good Social 30 teacher.  I actually REMEMBER EVERYTHING he taught today and understand it all.  He is very good, and the class has so much structure compared to BOB's Social program.  There are only about 16 people in the class, and like hardly anyone talks so there are like no distractions or anything.  I love Summer School, or at least the first day.  I have my first unit test next week already and we got like five million assignment today.  I drove Alicia back to my house from Summer School and then we had the left over fries and onion rings from Peters last night.  We ran a whole bunch or erins and then picked up a vanilla cone each from McDonalds - by the way their ice cream, apples, and yougurt parfait are the ONLY things I will eat there.  The rest of the stuff is nasty.  For like an hour Ali and I sat outside on my swing.  Then we went to the gym, did half an hour cardio and the entire circuit of weights, then we went for a swim in the pool and hot tub.  It was a fun night and a fun day.  Once I got home from the YMCA I was planning to do some more social homework...lol...I am interested in Social for once (that is like a first!!!) and well then I ate my dinner at like 9.  What a day!!
