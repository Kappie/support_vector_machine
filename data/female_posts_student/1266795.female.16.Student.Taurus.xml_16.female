I know that ashley wants to go and to let you guys know ahead of time if you wanna come, the movie is at 1:15 and it's 2hrs and 4 min. not including previews. we were thinking grab a bite to eat somewhere and then the movie since we've got some time to kill from 11 - 1. so tell me if you wanna go!  " -'Mais ce n'est pas un homme! C'est un champignon! - 'un quoi?' -'Un champignon!!!' " Now here it goes...i'm totally just guessing at this.  -But it's not a guy! It's a mushroom! - A what? -A mushroom!!! you guys can all laugh at me if i got that translation wrong, but it's worth a shot. and i'm guessing it's from le petit prince. i seriously don't get that book!!! french or no french, it's gibberish to me..  To all you people in lyceum. good luck tonite, sry i can't come but i've got to cram for the french final and alg II test.
