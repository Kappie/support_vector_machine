Specially since she is so well-known, it is such a big deal to all these news reporters that MK Olsen has gone to a tratment facility. Also because she is a twin i think it will be even harder bcoz they have grown up practically exacly the same appearence and as far as i know same overall nature and to have all these people suddenly talking 'bout her supposable case of anorexia would be horrific. (she might be judged next to her sister. If she was not a twin then there is no kind of contrast if you know what i mean. good twin bad twin sorta thing.) Also everyone in melbourne was like 'she is so slack' coz she didnt show up at Knox a couple of days ago and im like 'giv her a break! You know? She needs help'. If i was her i just wouldnt be able to handle it all. The constant pressure of the paparazzi and such in hollywood, itd be hard. To even take that first step of admitting it would not only be hard for a normal person but for her, in hours after she admits it like 1/3 of the population would like know. At least they are not like diss'ing her, that would be all too harsh.  She is human.  Apparently she had to be taken out of school to eat and also her land rover got taken away from her coz her father said they would only give it back if she eats more coz she had already had a crash, and they were scared her fragile frame would just crack. So lord i pray not only for MK but also for everyone out there who is in a similar sitch. Lolove CM
