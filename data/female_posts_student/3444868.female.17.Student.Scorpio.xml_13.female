I was there a total of three hours and her grandmother was there so I didn't really have to babysit.  I got $20 for playing for three hours. So of course I couldn't have that money just laying around the house so I went shopping yesterday.  I got the coolest dress.  It looks like I just walked out of an Austin Powers movie.  Friday was the last day of the theatre workshop.  I could never imagine backstage being more hectic than it was that night.  Lucky me I was working back there with all the little kids.  After that I went to Applebees with theatre people for a going away party for someone.  It was surprisingly fun.  Saturday I didn't really do anything except Lyncoln's birthday party which was fun.  We went glow bowling.  Someone thought Riggins was someone's dad.  What I don't get is why these two guys would come up to a dad and ask about me and Stevie.  Of course the guy in the red hat seemed more interested in Stevie than the other one was interested in me.  In fact I didn't even know he was until Riggins told me the guy asked how old I was in stuff.  He never actually talked to me which was fine because I don't picture bowling as a place to find a great guy.  I also found out the truth about some of the people from school I saw there.  I learned that Brett smoked (doesn't surprise me) and so does caraway (does surprise me).  Maybe I'm just sheltered but stuff like that just ruins the impressions of people I originally have.  I think that's all I've done but for some reason I think I'm forgetting something.  Oh well chances are it wasn't anything important.
