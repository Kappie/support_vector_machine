They were okay but not my style, it was like jazz/electronic, weird combo if u ask me. I got a phonecall during their show and I felt bad but w.e. I went home and took a nap, got ready. Then got in a fight with my mom cuz I don't know, it was dumb and kind of pointless but I ended up crying cuz we've gone for awhile w/o fighting so I was sad. She said I was grounded so she took my keys away from me but said I could go out if Tim takes me (that's my mom's weird grounding rules, most of the times she grounds me, she takes me shopping, she's weird like that but i appreciate it and love it now lol) so Tim had to drive me. I went to see Anchorman, oh man, funniest movie ever, well not funniest but pretty darn close. Will Ferell is soo adorkable  ...lyrics in my head... but even the most beautiful of all roses must someday crumble to dust and fade away. It's a certain tragedy. So it's on into the lonely nights and all the rest of it. The empty space between me and the sunken walls and feeling someone's hand around my neck choking away the life that I have left. And I can finally see that the further I go I'm only treading ground that I don't want to know. I'll probably hang upside down from wooden rafters in my home and look at old photos of you. I miss the warmth of the summer when we we're on our own, but now it's winter and my bones are cold. -saves the day "Look into my eyes you will see what you mean to me...Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for You can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for...Take me as I am take my life I would give it all I would sacrifice Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for I can't help it there's nothin' I want more...There -was- no love like our love There's nowhere unless you're there...Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for I can't help it there's nothin' I want more.."-Bryan Adams "Rumors flew but nobody knew How much she blamed herself.
