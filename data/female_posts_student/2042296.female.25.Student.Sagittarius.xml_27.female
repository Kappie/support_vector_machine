In any case our parents know about this and reactions have been delighted. My mom was, however, surprisingly lame about that. Somehow disappointed "oh, you're getting engaged..." Maybe she still thinks I'm going back to Finland to live with her. Brrr. Only the idea of it makes me shiver ;)  But this is just wonderful. We're going to get married maybe 2006, maybe later. We'll see about that later :)  I almost don't believe this is happening to me. This is almost too good to be true!
