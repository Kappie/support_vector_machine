When adding a link please remember to include the closing quote ( " ) because if you forget to close the quote, the computer thinks that everything that follows after is part of the link -- thus messing up the EDIT link.    PIA: Concerning pictures, use your best judgement.  My advice is to resize to a size that will fit the browser.  About 500 by 500 pixels is a good size.  If you are posting the pictures in GOLDEN SUSHI, 350 by 350 (or smaller) would be ideal.  If you are posting pictures in your own blog, you might go smaller so as not to ruin the table layout.
