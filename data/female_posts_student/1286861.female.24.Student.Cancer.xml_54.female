Victorville, I am still in a state of denial. Don't get me wrong...Victorville is an okay place. People have been living here for a long time, doing just fine, and living very normal and adjusted lives. But it is not where I wanted to go. Not where I want to be. Please understand my motivation if I ever speak ill of the town.  I was hired at a company by the name of  urlLink MWB Business Systems.  I will be working customer service in the billing department of the company. I was overjoyed to hear that they have an office in Irvine, and employees are welcome to transfer from one office to another. Cross your fingers, this may be a very big opportunity.  I got the call on Monday that they would like me to come in and get the paperwork for the ever popular "Drug and Alcohol Screen". Seeing as though I am neither an alcoholic or a drug-ee, I am considering myself hired. I start on Tuesday, July 6th, after the holiday weekend. I did this before and the job did not work out, but let's see how this additional link to the sidebar works out.  I went to a buddies wedding this weekend in Santa Ana. With Brenden's car still out of the picture, we worked the bus, train and taxi system to death over the two days I was there. Public transportation...remind me t get my ass on the whole "get my license back" campaign. I need it. Badly.  The wedding itself was very very nice. I was going to see some dear friends, who after being out of touch for over a year, were not as dear as they used to be. I was picturing going to the wedding, sitting with my buds at their table, chumming it up and having a grand time. I got there, hugged who I could, sat at a table with people I did not know, and I was in the really hard place of wanting to strike up conversations, but having no flippin' idea of what to say. It was hard, it was reality, but it was hard.  So plans now are to enjoy this next week I will still not be working, doing a lot of sleeping, and trying to find some way to spend my 4th of July. And, oh...yes..19 days till my birthday :)
