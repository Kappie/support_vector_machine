I was looking at the pictures on my dads digital and they look pretty good for the most part and Im going to get them on my computer asap!! Im kinda mad though because my dad took the best picture of me and Mitchell on the beach and we were both faking to be asleep because my mom was boring us like crazy to watch the sunset that was still and hour and a half away but she still wanted to just stand around and wait for it....it was CRAZY!!! But anyway someone ended up erasing it :'( Anyways now that I am home I get to drive again!!! My parents are thinking about making me now drive the concorde because Nick will be having our car a lot because of work and stuff so I have to drive the Concorde. I hate that car! Its like a boat its soo long. I am soo scared and on top of that I take my driving test on Monday! DUNDUNDUN! Im not sure I am going to pass. My dad told me though that tomorrow when Nick has to work that he will take him to work so I can practice drving in a smaller car since my test is in a civic which is like half the size of the Concorde. Im still trying to talk my dad into letting me drive the Saab but he keeps saying no. HUMF! Anyway on another note...today when we got back my dad went outside and checked the pool to make sure the craetaker did alright and when he was checking it he looked at the temp of the water and it was at 92!! PARTY! It is now at the temp that I will swim at (i am a total wimp!) I am just so happy to be home again (well my temp home again, we all know where my REAL home iswith the red doorhehe) if you wanna do anything then give me a buzz! Ill try to have some pictures next time!!
