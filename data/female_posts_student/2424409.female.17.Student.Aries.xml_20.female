Im not in tip top condition today, sorry...i guess it kinda hard when u will probably have to move outa your house cuz the landlords put it up for sale, and its possibly sold to a couple from calgary, so it definetly won't be a rental home, which basically means i have 2 months to find a new place to live...which is really stupid because we have been excellent tendants, never had a lete check or anything... but i guess they just decided they don't want the house anymore... they don't like being landlords or something... whatever i don't care... wel i do, but im not going to bore you with the sad details that piss me off... I talked to "todd" the other day ( remember, i changed his name for personal reasons... im actually curtious of other peoples feeling, unlike him who pastes my name all over his website) and he's doing ok, i guess, hey was playing in the hall with a ball, and we got sent outside for makin lotza noise, guess we were laughing to loud.. I dunno, no big or anything... Oh hey, if any one out there knows Destiny Cusson...tell her i wanna kick her ass...she said i was ugly and a basically called me a virginic whore (now theres an oxymoron for ya) but she's not exactly the brightest crayon in the box...but im sick of her shit, and if she can't back off and let me live my life im gonna beat the piss right outa her perma-pregnant little body (she just recently got another abortion, whats that #5??) but whateves who cares about her or what she thinks?? i don't, and no one in duncan should either, because nothing that comes outs her mouth is believable...  Wowits amazing how writing here makes me feel so much better..ttyl....~Hugs to all my friends~                    Sippie (new nick name...long story)
