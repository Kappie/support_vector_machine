I guess that's what tired me out the most. Thinking about it also has left me sapped. But what do I think about the movie? I can't really say. Mom doesn't understand why Jesus had to suffer so much, and why God let him suffer. Dad on the other hand feels angry overall. He was especially angry at the Pharisees. As for me, I really don't know how to react. I feel guilty, yes, but not as guilty as I thought I would feel.  I wonder. If I was in the shoes of the Jews, would I believe in Jesus? I wonder if I am strong enough to stick it out with him, or would I deny him like Peter? I compare it to having a person with a gun come to me and ask me if I believed in God. There are only two answers. What would I do? Of course, I can't say; it's one of those things that you'll only know if it were to happen. And of course again, I would rather not have that happen.   Right now, I have a headache. Crying really does tire me out.
