(i have the house phone in my room in case the call i was waiting on wasnt to my cell phone.) anywho, i dont answer it because its a blocked call.  then  my cell phone rings with a private call. holy crap. i answer it, and just as the last blocked call that i answered on my house phone (at frickin 9:30 in the morning, mind you) its someone moaning and breathing deep like they're... well you know. so i hung up. THEN THEY CALLED AGAIN. so i picked up and was like "stop fucking calling me!" and well, they didnt call back this morning. i hate that i somehow managed to meet a big sicko that has my home and cellphone numbers. i know its not one of my friends. i think i might know who it is. what a freak.  worked last night. that was painful. my back and my knees just cant handle walking around a lot... sounds weak i know, but i cant help it! sure when its time for  my  massage someone has to go home! bleh. well, i dont work again till possibly friday anyhow. even then, im only on call. how ridiculous.  i miss tara. she's been with lindsey all the time now since lindsey doesnt have a boyfriend anymore. that doesnt seem fair. i know they've been best friends for years while i was gone, but i was still a best friend... or so i thought. just kinda hurts. not to mention that i have a terrible history with people in general. specifically those that were once close to me. it hurts, but not NEAR as much as it would had it happened about a year earlier. im used to feeling like this. but i just didnt expect it, i guess. not with tara. i know i havent called her to hang out either, but she's been with lindsey all the time and she doesnt invite me, because i know lindsey doesnt like me. so i figured if maybe there's a day that she's not with lindsey, she'll call and want to hang out. but probably not. plus, i have a feeling tara isnt into hanging out and doing things we used to anymore. knowing there's manipulation and persuasion involved, tara probably thinks poorly of me now also.  every time im on here i think of stephanie. probably because she was the first person i knew to have a blog, but also because i know she feels how i feel quite often. and i love and miss her. and i wish she was here for me to talk to. what a beautiful soul.
