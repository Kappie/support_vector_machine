OH and MICKEY CHAO IS CHAO IN SPANISH MAYBE IN LATIN ITS CIAO BUT IN SPANISH ITS CHAO I LOOKED IT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just for the record. Anywho so then i went to Biology which holds the devil teacher. Her attitude was "sit down, shut up" you suck. And, then she was like if your not quiet i'll beat you up. Oh and she gave us 5 SHEETS FRONT AND BACK TO DO!!!!!!!! And i only got one done in class so i was like is this homework and she doesn't believe in homework so she said no but we have a short lab tomorrow and after that we can work on them. But, they are due at the end of class so yea that would kinda make them homework. OK, so yea hate that class. 3rd and 4th were good no homework, love the class, and the teacher is cool to. 5th well band will be band. Had sectionals and went and played w/ the brass b/c mr. king had to go so school so not much happened there.  6th in geog. we just worked on our project. I'm done w/ the first one so that totally rocks and its not due until the 27th. 7th we just interviewed a classmate and presented it. Our paper isn't due until friday and i got it done today! woohoo. Now all i have to do is type it. Then i went to band practice and what makes this the day from h-e-double hockey stick is that Katie found out that she broke a nail!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
