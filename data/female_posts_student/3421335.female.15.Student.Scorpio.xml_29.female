Someday we'll know  If love can move a mountain  Someday we'll know  Why the sky is blue  Someday we'll know why I wasn't meant for you   Does anybody know the way to Atlantis?  What the wind says when she cries?  I'm speeding by the place that I met you  For the ninety-seventh time, tonight   Someday we'll know  If love can move a mountain  Someday we'll know  Why the sky is blue  Someday we'll know  Why I wasn't meant for you  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah   Someday we'll know  Why Samson loved Delilah  One day I'll go  Dancing on the moon  Someday you'll know that I was the one for you   I bought a ticket to the end of the rainbow Watch the stars crash in the sea  If I could ask God just one question  Why aren't you here with me, tonight?   Someday we'll know  If love can move a mountain  Someday we'll know  Why the sky is blue  Someday we'll know why I wasn't meant for you  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah   Someday we'll know  Why Samson loved Delilah  One day I'll go  Dancing on the moon  Someday you'll know that I was the one for you    Someday we'll know by Mandy Moore and Jonathan Foreman
