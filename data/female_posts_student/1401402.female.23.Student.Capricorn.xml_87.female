Again I begun to think that I'm wasting time. Many days I dunno what to do. I don't understand the things I do. The world is so unkind to me. I've decided to let you go. Another great guy has left my life for good. I broke his heart and I felt bad. But its only fair that I let him go. Thanks for the joy you've given me. GOOD BYE MICHAEL YU.  "Until I Get Over You"   Woke up today thinking of you, Another night that I made my way through So many dreams still left in my mind, But they can never come true, I press rewind and remember when, I close my eyes and I`m with you again. But in the end I can still feel the pain, every time I hear your name   [Chorus]  The sun won`t shine since you went away. Seems like the rain`s falling every day. There`s just one heart, where there once was two. But that`s the way it`s gotta be, `til I get over you   [Verse 2]  Walked through the park, in the evening air. I heard a voice and I thought you were there. I run away but I just can`t escape. Memories of you everywhere. They say that time will dry the tears. But true love burns for a thousand years. Give my tomorrows for one yesterday. Just to know that I could have you here   [Bridge]  When will this river of tears stop fallin`. Where can I run so I won`t feel alone. Can`t walk away when the pain keeps callin`. I`ve just gotta take it from here on my own. But it`s so hard to let go.   Life is best when you realize the moment that you`re in and cherish it forever. I think the greatest thing is having a dream and then reaching it. Through out my whole life, I realize that sometimes you have to work extra hard to get there, and once you are there..enjoy it!
