(hint, hint, emily...) but every minute that goes by is a minute later she'll come over...or, more accurately, i fear...every minute is another reason why she shouldnt sleep over. who comes to sleep over at 10:00, right? she knows (or should know) that the later she comes over, the later im gonna want to keep her up. but, oh, i keep hoping in vain... pleasepleasepleaseplease  ahhhh. this is the stuff that drives me crazy...the hoping in vain and the let down after the hope is gone.. and... ahhh, i hate it. it makes me feel like...well, i get this image if an inflatable clown dummy that someone just keeps punching like a punching bag and the clown just keeps coming back each time....just to get punched in the face again. its kinda like that. and i wish it wasnt. makes me wanna scream that i hate the world...in that stupid teeanger way. and im not a stupid teenager, i just...i just want my friend. is that so much to ask for? dont i deserve it?  anyone who reads this...come on...dont i deserve to see emily more often? doesnt it drive me crazy when i never get to see her...never get to talk to her? cant i just get what i want? what ill comes of it? i just want to see my friend! dont i deserve that?  ahhh.  lets hope she calls/gets online soon.  pleasepleasepleasepleaseplease *crossing fingers*
