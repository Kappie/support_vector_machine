I'm still not totally sure of what my feelings for him are yet. I'm kinda confuzed. I think i'm pretty sure i like him. does that make ANY sense? "i think i'm pretty sure"? well, it does to me, so deal with it!  *sigh* the only thing is, i don't think my mommy would approve of it. it's another shawn situation. my mom had no problem with shawn, but she had a problem with me dating him. i think that's going to be the case with nathan. that's why i plan to take no action on this crush for a long while yet. atleast not until she kinda sorta forgets the whoel reason i wasn't talking to him....she's nto as forgiving as i am, and i'm a ruthless B.  oh well.....it wouldn't be the first time i've dated someone she didn't like. but hopefully she'll learn to like him...but it won't matter for a while, b/c, like i said, i won't be dating him anytime soon....  well, i guess i'm going to talk to him some more...*smile*
