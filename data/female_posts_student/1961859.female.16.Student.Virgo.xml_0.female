Anyhow, Im listening to Al Muallim CD now, and the nasheed applied to how I was feeling. I sometimes wish I could have the manners of the companions of the prophet. They had the perfect example with them.    'He (Muhammad PBUH) taught us to be  just  and  kind  And to feed the poor and hungry, Help the wayfarer and the orphan child And to not be cruel and miserly,  His  speech was soft and gentle , Like a mother stroking her child, His mercy and compassion,  Were most radiant when he smiled  Abal Qasim  Ya Habibi ya Muhammad  Ya Shafi'i ya Muhammad  Khayru khalqillahi Muhammad '   Al Muallim - Sami Yusuf Â© 2003 Awakening
