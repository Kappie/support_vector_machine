I had stated that the summer movie season would receive it's first big triumph in the form of   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  . Well, I was wrong, it wasn't just a triumph for the summer movie season it was a triumph for the cinema in general. I mean, I was a fan of the first two installments but they pale in comparison to the epic piece of film making that is   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  .   Just as J.K. Rowling's   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban   represents a step in maturity beyond the series' first two books, so does director Alfonso Cuaron's film version improve upon its predecessors. This third   Harry Potter   movie shakes the candy coating off of the franchise without violating its spirit. Chris Columbus, who directed the first two, is skilled at assembling the elements and moving a story along, but he doesn't leave behind ideas that haunt or images that linger. I feel he was a great choice to start off the series, but as Harry grows so must the director. Switching to a more artistic director, an edgier director was the right thing to do.  When I first heard they had hired Alfonso Cuaron to direct   Prisoner   I must admit I was a bit worried, I mean I had never heard of him. So I did some research, checked out some of his work and came up with only one conclusion. Cuaron is one of the most gifted visual storytellers around(he's no Tarantino, but honestly who is), whether he's working with the lavish production design of   A Little Princess   (1995) or the intimate, near-soft core porn style of   Y Tu Mama Tambien   (2002). What those two very different films have in common is that the Mexican-born director goes so far beneath the young protagonists' skin that you virtually can feel their hearts beating.  It's no wonder, then, that Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) comes into his own at last in   The Prisoner of Azkaban  , which has the advantage of being based on an emotionally rich book that begins with him hitting the troublesome age of 13. In the first two movies Radcliffe's Harry was just a little too cute, unruffled and goody-goody. The Harry of the books is far more of a mischief-maker, and Cuaron and the increasingly assertive Radcliffe get the idea. You know you've entered new territory from the opening shot, as Harry reads his wizard books under his bedsheets while flicking his wand, furiously, for light. Using magic while living with Muggles (non-magical humans, in this case the beastly Dursley family) is forbidden, but Harry has had enough of being treated like the black sheep. As in   Chamber of Secrets  , the new film has Harry causing havoc in the household, but Cuaron doesn't play the sequence for slapstick. When Harry casts a spell on his visiting Aunt Marge (Pam Ferris) after she cruelly disparages his late parents, his rage and his relatives' fear become apparent.  Like all of Rowling's books, this episode aims for an incrementally older audience than its predecessor while covering a year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Once again Harry tries to excel in wizard training and the airborne game Quiddich while warding off the increasingly dark forces that threaten his life. This time a notorious killer, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), is on the loose after becoming the first-ever escapee from the famed Azkaban prison, and Harry soon hears that Black is after him. Making matters worse, Azkaban's cloaked, phantom-like prison guards, called Dementors, are roaming in search of Black, striking our hero with particularly deep fear and dread. Also fresh on the scene are new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor Lupin (David Thewlis, a warm, lanky presence), who has a habit of protecting Harry at key moments, and Divination Professor Trelawney (Emma Thompson, wearing Coke-bottle glasses in a comic-relief role).  The usual suspects are back as well: Harry's best friends regular-bloke Ron (Rupert Grint) and assertive brainiac Hermione (Emma Watson); the gentle, bearish Hagrid (Robby Coltrane), who takes over the Care of Magical Creatures class with typically unwieldy results; the sneering Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) of the rival Slytherin house; the acidic Professor Snape (Alan Rickman); the stern but kindly Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) and Hogwarts' wise, eccentric headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon, replacing the late beloved Richard Harris does an admirable job).   Film producers rarely receive the kind of recognition that directors do, yet that cast offers a powerful reminder of how well produced this series has been, by David Heyman and, on   Azkaban  , Columbus and Mark Radcliffe (no relation to the actor). Rowling's vast world requires the casting of dozens of key roles, and over three movies there hasn't been a ringer in the bunch, especially now that Daniel Radcliffe's Harry has stepped up. It's hard to return to the books and not have the movies' actors in your head. The same goes for the scenery, as Cuaron has inherited production designer Stuart Craig and his clearly articulated vision of Hogwarts, though the place has never appeared so weirdly wonderful as in our first glimpse of it here, as choir singers grasping fat frogs serenade a banquet hall illuminated by airborne candles.  Most important, the visuals inevitably are tied to mood and feelings. When a power outage hits the students' annual train ride to Hogwarts, there's a beautiful faraway shot of Ron's hand pressed to the window, his flesh the only visible light at that moment of vulnerability. Even more chilling are the Sirius Black "wanted" posters, which show the scraggly escapee raging in a film loop. On a lighter note, when Harry finally rides the winged Buckbeak, the movie takes off with him as he leaves behind his frustrations and ill omens for a moment, at least, of pure exuberance.  Well without giving anymore of the movie away(for those of you that are "hallmark" Harry Potter fans that don't read the books) I will finish by saying that this is an amazingly powerful piece of cinema that has the ability to make anyone a Harry Potter fan. And in case any of you are wondering, they are shooting for a November 2005 release of   Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  .   Grade: A
