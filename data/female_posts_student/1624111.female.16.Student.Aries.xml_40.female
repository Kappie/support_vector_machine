Me: "i dont know...i dont know..."  Bear:"we had so many happy memories together"  Me: "back when i actually knew who emily was" Bear: "you can still love me"  Me: "love you for what?" Bear: "the memory i am"  Me: "that would just be clinging on to the past"  Bear: "a past you loved"  Me: "one ought not to live in the past" Bear:  "you can still appreciate it"  Me: "dont sugar coat it, bear"  [turns around in bed so that she can no longer see Bob]  thats kinda werid, isnt it? ah, i dunno... i dont want to be mad at bob. poor bob...everyone used to love bob. thats my mental vacation... just like i used to do so many times over the summer before 9th. my mental vacation is...me, having arived home from a fun and tiring sleepover, curingly up in a compact ball of warmth and tirendess in my bed squeezing tight little bob and feeling really happy and content and loved and, just, hugigng that bear for all the wonderful things it represents...loving its touch, its feel, its sight, its smell... breathing bear, breathing memories... and just... feeling so peacefully tired. in a way where everything felt good and right and all i had to do all day was sleep and sleep and sleep... tranquil sleep. and i havent felt like that in soooo long. i guess sort of in arizona...but emily was there so it wasnt the same. my mental vacation does not involve being in the same bed with emily...haha, no. maybe erics does though... (or, brandon's, rather) but...i dunno... good old bob isnt so much the proud symbol he used to be. i guess he still stands for my memories, which are good... but i shouldnt lie in bed at night with bob needing the small amount of peace he affords me to have some content sleep. thats like a drug or something... crazy. and, in truth, i dont need that to fall asleep...but its a happier, better sleep if i do than if i just fall alseep due to fatigue...which i end up doing most nights. i fall asleep in the middle of my thoughts. a lot of the time its like, "our father, who art i-zzzzzzzzz" yep.   but anyway, i think im seriously gonna go a little crazy sometime soon...cause its insane...all this waiting and im already soooooooooooooo incredibly sick of waiting and being lonely and wanting to know more... and having none of that quenched...and weekend after weekend goes by and it just builds and builds and...i dunno... either im gonna go emotionless and give up and all that crap or im gonna totally freak out and get really sad and really stressed out and just be all "i cant take it anymore" and run away and sleep and sleep and sleep and read and read and read and just try to escape into anything i can escape into. and thats a horrible way to live. either way this sucks...its kinda weird...im freaking out now cause im too detached from a person i depend on for soooooo many things...which isnt necessarily good, cause im probably overly dependant....but then i go from dependant to psycho....wheres teh ahppy medium? and if that was dependant...dependant wasnt so bad...it was pretty damn good, if you want to know. and wow ive said dependant a lot of times. dependant dependant dependant. weee. okay, i need my sleep now...   just...i miss emily a lot still...a whole lot...always. but sometimes more than others...like when im reminded of how little we talk and how little i know about her... today wasnt so bad until tonight though. was good stealing the jacket and wearing it around all day...so what if it gives me a somewhat false sense of being close to her? false or not, ill take what i can get. annoying assembly, but no big deal... she got online which was good too, got to laugh at the stupid field hockey people who dont think shes a virgin... but then theres this california business which steals her from me on the one night i had sort of thought was gauranteed id get her...halloween... but, nope, cant sleepover. its horrible! at the begining of the year it was like "jsut wait a few weeks, she can tdo something then" and i waited and i waited..and nothing and then finally it was like "ooooh, 3 day weekends, surely she could sleepover then"....but no.  both   are a no. and then it was like "well, theres still halloween" ...but no! i dont even get that! grrrrrrr. so theres that aspect to it, but then she says shes going to california and that she thought she told me and that shes been telling everyone....why am i the last to hear about this? thats how little i talk to her... i dont even know when shes leaving the goddam state anymore... eric knows soooooooooooo much more than i do about her! *long, painful, hopeless sigh* i know nothing... i try so hard, too. and still...nothing. this sucks. this sucks sooo much. im so sick of it too. i want my happiness back. its like i cant be truly happy until things are good between us...and theyre not now and they havent been...and i just...i can be happy...but not really truly happy where you feel so good about life and everything. its a life sucks kind of happy. i want an "i love life! there is a God! Olivia's crazy!" kind of happy... or, i dunno... at least complete and fully penetrating happiness... which i dont think i can get until that voice in the back of my head that has been worrying now for weeks and weeks and weeks and...well, at least a month...probably months...  going like "i miss emily" all the time and...other stuff too... and i cant be truly happy until that voice is silenced...not forgotten or ignored, but silenced...as in the problem has been fixed...and i have no worrys and no concerns whatsoever and i can just be happy. and if i wanna silence that voice, i gotta see emily more... but i cant becuase shes so freaking busy. so, that, emily, is why your busyness is detrimental to my happiness. not like i can never be happy unless im with you, because thats wrong, but... this craziness caused by my lack of...you is pretty all consuming and its making it hard for me to be totaly at peace with things....wich means i cant be really happy... which means im sooooooooooooooooooo sick of waiting for things to get better. and...im so tired. both of this and physically right now.  so i think im gonna go to bed... sigh... i wonder if shell read this... ah, i dont care.  This is what i want:
