We arrived at the beachhouse with heroic flair abiding, our long hair and barbarian claymores signaling the begining of a new era -   Spring Break 03': Escapade of the Still-life and it's cr3w...  And an Escapade it most surely was, for as our foreign eyes met the ghetto-town of Seaside it was clear that rockedge was in serious scarcity... Rockedge needed to be done, though not with Axe's and Amp's, but a rocking of sheer suave-ness and cruise'n power.  And rock we did. We unsettled the poor unsuspecting populas with such a thundering ripple of public disturbence, none such thing had been seen in ages. Through the windows of a Plymoth Voyager LE, a small town was changed. Temporarily at least... until I turned off the bluegrass music to keep Eric from screaming.  Other developments found their mark as well, as we discovered that "Conan the Barbarian" is in actuallity a C rated porno flick that failed. To quote Jeremy formally of the band known as Still-life, "All I wanted was a comedy." We did many other things however... things so crazy and remote that to mention the mere occurence of them would be in dishonor of the event, for explaination would not do justice enough to appease the spirit of those occasions.  When we exhausted all other forms of rocking, which included walking on the beach from 12:10AM to 3:00 AM, we resorted to classical rocking... STILL-LIFE STYLE. Joe's new song shall be ready for the FCOG show next month.  chills and thrills to the peeps on the block. that was a shoutout.
