You see my mom and my aunt have this whole business planned to move to tennesse and start a business. well to do that we have to sell are house. My mom said it going to happen eventully, this year. She knows i want more of a challenge and Pine creek is a more challenging school. i am not at all hooked to sand creek, but i dont want to live in my aunts house. It really depends on which room i stay in though. If i am in the basement i will be in a place that smells really bad. has dog vomit every where and is basically a total dump. They have an extra room nobody is in and if i get that room i am all for it. I just want to know where i am going to be. I will havve my own room for the first time in my life and that would be sooo cool. I of course would not be able to have internet access unless i come HOME. The other thing is that my sister wont come. She will stay at home with my mom. You see she is in cheerleading and doesnt want to give that up. whatever. I just want us to all go together. I want to start the process. I want i want i want. Jeez. i guess i should go for reasons. Hey if i go i probly could have friends over more often. Or go to friends more often. I dont know. I wnat to go to that school soooooo bad and i guess i should give it a try. Its not like any of my friends are really aROUND TO BE FRIENDS. they all really suck ass. Good luck with the decision. ----------amanda
