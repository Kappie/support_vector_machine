Plus the weather hasn't been all that nice lately.  Their deck is friggin huge.  I am getting to the point that I just want to get this half finished.  I am usually not a quitter, but since they are pushing me so much, and my life has suddenly gotten alot busier I just want to finish this half, and let them get a taste of what it's like.  It is not worth it.  I can work in the air conditioning, and not have to worry about bugs, getting paint on myself, doing three coats, getting to their house (not that big of a prob since I drive, but it's not like they're neighbors or in this part of town) or taking care of their three dogs.  I averaged it out, and I'm getting paid around six bucks an hour... NOT WORTH IT!!    Last night, Quinton asked me to go out to lunch with him today.  He doesn't know that Matt and I are back together and nor do I want to tell him.  Does he want to go out as a date?  I certainly don't want to.  If so, that's the third person in a week.  I need to wear a sign that says I'm not interested.  I am going to try to post more, and I will try to  keep it interesting. =P
