Sadly, the A's were down 1-4 at that point. However, pretty soon after, things started turning around. We left during the top half of the eighth inning when the score was 13-4, the A's. We, like almost everyone else in the stadium, figured that there was no way that any team, let alone the Yankees, could get back on top with such a deficit. We were right. Final score was 13-4. I know I've already said that a bunch of times, but, baby, the score is just too beautiful.  I'll back in the Bronx tomorrow for Game 2. This time with Garth. Maybe I'll even wear an A's tee in honor of my boys and my baseball boyfriend (sorry Barry, when you start winning more games, you can replace him), Eric Byrnes. AL player of the week, baby!
