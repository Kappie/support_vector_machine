Angel eyes, why dont you sit on down? make my life worth living, just for today. say a few words, even if you dont want. humor me, pity me, let me feel some fake love. since thats all you have to offer, for this girl that adores the space you occupy. exspecialy when its beside her.. Angel eyes, touch me anywhere! even if its only for a second.. let me feel that electricity let me pretend whats fake is real, and pretend i didn't notice. Angel eyes, would you fall for a girl like me? of course you wouldnt. but i fell for you. and i hit the bottom so hard that i swallowed my pride and when i stood up i was dizzy and weak. things became blurs. love is blind. Angel eyes, lead me of through your circle of seduction because even though that little path wont get us anywhere...id follow you everywhere like a lost puppy who fell in love. i dont mean to be cliched, but.. Angel eyes, i'll do whatever you want, but i'll never ask for your love. because i already know the answer and my eyes could never stay dry, and my mind would reject the rejection. Angel eyes, you have a wonderful mind and a beautiful body.. but a terrible heart. you make me feel low i remember once upon a time..you made me want to be better. now i just wish i was different. ====================================================================================  dwayne said that was a cute little poem. i think it was to. not the best i've written but worthy of something, nonetheless.
