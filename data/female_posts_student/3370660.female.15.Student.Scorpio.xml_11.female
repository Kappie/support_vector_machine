There isn't math or sciences, rather courses like "creative writing" and "amateur astronomy". Nothing too heavy, but stuff with substance. I was in the middle of an all bass orchestra class, everyone was changing into different chucks and grabbing basses off the shelves. One problem- each one had a major defect that disallowed for production of music. Mine was missing all its strings! Others were bridgeless, one was even without the neck. We all stood around looking kind of stupid, trying to see what needed to be done. They sent me out to look for our teacher(who had been absent the entire time we were there). I walked through Bluemont Hall and ran into Vineet. Crap. All the sudden I went into my different personality and tried to seem as indifferent as I could. We talked a little, but not much. He had been assigned to a volleyball class(against his own will), and I decided to walk back with him, in hopes I would possibly find my teacher. We arrived to his room and I just stood there stupidly for a moment. All of the sudden, this girl(who I met while I was at camp) runs up to him and just hangs all over him. He doesn't encourage this, nor does he push her away. That was enough for me. I yelled, "Fine, if  thats  how it is!", turned heel and ran off crying. He didn't try to stop me.  Part 2: 2:45-5:15 Back in Bluemont Hall; Linzy, Morgan and I decided to just leave, as we had useless basses and no teacher present. We roamed around campus, finally finding some party with other class jippers. They had a radio on loudspeaker. I recognized it as "Last Nite" by the Strokes. Heh, I mentioned this to Linzy and she gave me that "Gloria, you're such a dork." Oh well. I went for a walk alone, saw a few friends and said 'Hi', but no real conversatoin was had. I was being extremely anti social underneath a tree, sketching random scenes.  Part 3: 5:33-9:13 I was back somewhere I felt safe, and camp was over. I was at the Spangler's house, in the basement with Kacey. Their dog just had puppies and we were playing with them. Of course, they offered me one, but I knew mom would say no. So I sadly declined. We hung out for a few hours, just killing time. My mom showed up. She not only Ok'd the puppy, but she said I would live with them too. She didn't say it out of malice, or wanting to kick me out of the house. She just said it in an emotionless way. It was weird. So I started looking around(in this dream, they lived in a mansion) at all the tons and tons of rooms. I was about to pick one when-  I awoke to a cat licking my face.
