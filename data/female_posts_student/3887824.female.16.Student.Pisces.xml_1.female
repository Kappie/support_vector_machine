I found out that I read between 250-300 words per minute (Above Average?).   Here isa quote from Matt Groening:   "Love is a snowmobile racing across the tundra and then suddenly it flips over, pinning you underneath. At night, the ice weasels come."   ???? Okay, then.  Here are some quotes from Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.   "Dr. Evil: You're not quite evil enough. You're semi-evil. You're quasi-evil. You're the margarine of evil. You're the Diet Coke of evil, just one calorie, not evil enough."   "Austin: You're one groovy baby....baby."   Okay, that's enough. Well, one more quote. From The Shawshank Redemption.   "Warden Samuel Norton: I believe in two things: discipline and the Bible. Here you'll receive both. Put your trust in the Lord; your ass belongs to me. Welcome to Shawshank."   Yeah, I'm done now. Really.
