I met Jerad (who if i didnt have i probably would cracked a looooooong time ago) and this guy named Chris. I've talked to Jeared almot everyday since then but i didnt hear about or see Chirs till around the beginning of school when one of my friend was dating him and then not till Christmas time. Kelly started talkin about him and how she liked him and all that. So i was like oh yea i think i remeber him. And then nothing else for a while. Then on Super Bowl Sunday (one of my all time favorite days of the year)Chris IMed me and asked me if i wanted to go to a super bowl party casue he couldnt get a hold of kelly. I was all ehh why not? Havnt seen this guy in a year, have talked to him twice, whatever ill go, maybe i can help out kelly somehow. So this guy shows up at my door, tall, blonde, buff, really cute, and im like ehh kellys got good taste and i leave. As the night progressed I slowly started to be like hum, this guys really sweet, and fun, and....yea. So anyway after some small talk and a game of pink pong (witch i won bc i am a vitious pink pong player) we left and while we were waiting for his sister out side, we kissed. That started one of the best things ive ever had with one of the worst endings. He asked me out that week and it pissed kelly and my friend sarah off who had been dating him before. So we go out for a while, 3 months and i fell for him fast and hard. But then, things started to get in the way. School, his job, his mother, my curse of not being able to let somthing go if it makes me mad untill its fixed, little things like that, untill finally, it wasnt going anywhere anymore. And on April 24, at the Coronado prom, we broke up. It was the hardest thing i had ever done. Ever. To watch the person who i loved so much walk out of my life. It sounds like he broke up with me, but i broke up with and im still to this day im not 100% sure why. After a couple hours of feeling like crap i decided it was just a break kinda and we would get back together and i told him that. So a week goes by and all of the sudden were fighting about stuff again, and about when were ganna get abck together and so one thing/fight lead to another and as u guessed we didnt get back together. But at that point i still loved him. so about a month goes by mabey more and we talk about getting back together again i get excited, and of course since i just have the best luck, somthing happends yet again and we dont. So its over. For sure this time. We cant really talk anymore with out fighting, and i cant really talk about all of this with out crying. Someone gave me advice last night to get it out of my system and this is the abridged version but its out for the most part. And Chris if u do read this, just know that i am sorry. Take it or leave it.
