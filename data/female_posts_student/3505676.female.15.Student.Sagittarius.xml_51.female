After work i hung out with Christine and Dan for about an hour! I hadnt seen Chris in FOREVER! Then today i was supposed to be off but trevor *head guard/manager from Millbrook* called and wanted me to come in and work there from 9 to 2 cuz their person didnt show up.  So i worked there..it was fine.  Millbrook is a lot quieter then Optimist and w/ a lot less people working.  Most of the people working there are really nice too, but i dont talk to them too much.  However Trevor came and hung out by the front desk with me some.  He's a cool guy...hopefully ill get to see him a few more times this summer.  He gave me a ride home and TA DA!  Here i am!
