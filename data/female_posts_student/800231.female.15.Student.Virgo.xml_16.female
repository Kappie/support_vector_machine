Then again, that's probably how things like that always go. Anyway, this is one day after and pain is VERY minimal. The vicodin has seen to that. I did get a bit nauseated after the general anesthesia yesterday. Vomiting with wounds in your mouth is not something I ever want to go through again. I'm much better today, I look like a chipmunk cheekwise but I feel fine.   Alice and Stephanie called earlier to ask how I was doing. Well, Alice called to be nice, Steph just wanted to see my chipmunk cheeks... Oh well. I'm surprisingly hyper for someone on giant amounts of vicodin. I wonder is that's a bad sign? At least I have an excuse to sit around for a few days eating ice cream and playing video games. Every cloud has a silver lining ya know.
