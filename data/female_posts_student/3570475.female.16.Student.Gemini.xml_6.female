We are going to do great things this year, maybe even win ourselves a competition. The DCI show was awsome! I got to see my Magic buddies play on the field for the first time this year.  I want to go back so bad! Well anyways at camp for all the experienced players, we need to wip the new people into shape and prepare them for the awsome season coming up, but we need not to put them down and act like we are a bunch of hot shots, this will cause problems and will slow our progress way down and we do not want this to happen.  We want to dominate the field from the begining and intimidate the other bands. Make them fear Drum Corps! I hope that everyone has been practicing their exercises and show music. Also you should be exercising and getting in shape because we will probably do some running at practices and you will feel the pain if you do not prepare for it. You will also tire easier during the practices and the show if you dont exercise and we want to have a strong solid show this year. Dont forget the breathing exercises either, it will help you have a stronger sound which is what we expect to have this year. Well anyways I'll see you at camp which for all you who dont pay attention or lose papers or just forget it starts July 26th at 9am but you should come earlier because it starts at 9am so get there around 8:45am or earlier. Make sure to bring water and deodorant and your MUSIC! See you then! Bye Bye.   Luv ya'll, Corey Coomer
