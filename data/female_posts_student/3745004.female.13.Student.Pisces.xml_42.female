I'll try to keep my report short, but then again I've got a lot to say.. and I want to be able to read this at some later date and remember all the cool stuff. So, well... if it doesn't interest you, you don't have to read it. Also- it's like, near impossible for me to put all that I want to say in any coherent order, AND I have forgotten days for many of these things. So.. uh. Good luck!  -~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-   Day 1, Wednesday - Arrival. The place looks so foreign! It's really crowded, near impossible to park. While mum dear registers Katrina and I, we go find a bunk. Main dorm- no luck. So, down a flight of stairs to a little porch with bunks placed on it. No luck, so down a bit further to the.. pile of sticks! A cabin on the porch, in the minimalist sense of the word. Rectangular cutout for a door, square cutouts for windows with loose screens on them.. except for one. Guess who gets the top bunk where they can be assaulted by mosquitos flying in through the open window? Mmmhm. Me. Katrina's on the bottom bunk. So, we dump our junk, audition, and get to know the people there. There's four bunk beds in the cabin (not room for anything else >_x) If coming in from the main porch, my bunk would be the far left. On far right was Taylor (bottom) and Lois (top). Near left was Lindsey (bottom) and Angie (top). Near right was April (bottom) and Grace (top). Outside of the door near to me was a little 'second' porch, not the main one. As with the other, this porch was roof-less and wall-less. If coming from Cabin 1 (aka Pile 'O Sticks) near left on the single bunks was Liz the counselor, near right was a bunk on which Liz dumped her junk. Far left was Gwen, far right was the bunk on which Gwen dumped her junk. Then, at the end at a perpendicular to the other bunks, was Annie. And those were the porch-ers and the Cabin 1-ers. Although technically Cabin 1 was the people in Liz's group, which would be Liz, Annie, Gwen, Katrina, Lois, Taylor and I. Instead of having a cushy dorm like the rest (excluding the other -nicer- stickpile and the main porch) we had to face the elements and other disasters. e_e; We had a sort of pride thing going on by the end of the session. ((According to them this was a gianormous session with 150+ kids, I get the feeling they don't use the porch much))  First dinner was spaghetti. Our group sat in a circle on the ground, got to know each other after being forced to by the counselors, then learned about Liz the counselor. Liz is nearsighted, 21, and.. uh... stuff. I don't exactly remember anymore.  And thus ends an eventful day..   Day 2, Thursday - All that really stands out about this day is, when waiting in line for breakfast, I almost passed out. No, I'm not kidding. I guess it was the elevation + lack of food + lack of drink + lack of sleep that did it. But, when standing on the porch outside of the mess hall, I felt very sick. No, VERY sick. Soon I felt dizzy, then black started creeping in from the edges of my eyes like has happened before- but that's more or less normal for me. Anyway, according to Katrina I took a step backward and fell into a tree. (( urlLink THE TREE )) But I was saved from falling by Katrina and one of the counselors.. Jeff, I think. After that I surprisingly felt better, although directly after regaining my footing the whole world was in black and white, I'm not exaggerating.. I wasn't out for any amount of time, I didn't even lose consciousness. But, man.. it was exciting! After the fact, I can honestly say I sort of enjoyed it. Yes, yes, I am weird. But it was an experience. The rest was just a normal day, pretty much. We learned where we sat in band. I'm a 1st chair. We had 1st chairs and 2nd chairs. Although the unofficial section leader of the alto saxes was Alex, the scarily-good owner of a silver saxophone. I sat on the end, next to the bassoons and this guy, uhh.. I think his name was Mike. Yeah. That was my day.  We also had an egg drop.. no eggies lived T-T LONG LIVE THE TREE! Half the counselors were 'aliens' and half were 'dinosaurs.' It was scary. Ergh-eth!  Oh, and a basic day at Arrowbear. Although I don't have all the times..  7:15 AM - Reveille courtesy of Toshi the trumpet counselor. Prepare for breakfast, which starts as soon as you haul yourself out of bed. 7:15 AM - Breakfast (KP on days you had KP) 8:00 AM - Clean-up (or bathroom duty, if you have it) ?:?? AM - Morning Assembly ?:?? AM - Rehearsal #1, lasting for an hour ?:?? AM - Break ?:?? AM - Rehearsal #2, hour-long 12:00 AMish - Lunch (KP on days you had KP) 1:30 PM - Lunch Assembly 2:00 PM - Rec Time (woohoo!) Usually lasts for two-to-three hours. During this time there was optional crafts, hikes to Happy Gap, and the snack bar was open. Also on certain days the pool was open. ?:?? PM - Rest (One hour, I believe). According to Liz you could either read, listen to music, sleep or pretend to sleep. e_e; Around 5 or 6 PM - Dinner (KP on days you had KP) ?:?? PM - Evening assembly ?:?? PM - Rehearsal #3, one-hour ?:?? PM - Evening program, variable 9:30-10:00 PM - Campfire 10:30 PM - Taps again by Toshi  Busy busy busy!   Day 3, Friday - (I think) KP. You get to cut the lunch line, but you also have to wash the stupid dishes. I had to put away pots and pans that had been washed, rinsed, and sanitized which really wasn't as easy as it might sound. I think I got the job 'cause I was tall and could reach where to put things. Anyway, we got a rather bad boy's group to work with (one girls cabin group and one boys worked on KP at a time). Of the four stations for pots and pans one was occupied by me, one by Katrina, one by drummer Clay, and one by viola Daniel. And do you want to know what those stupid little sevvies did to us? Got us SOPPING wet in sanitizer water!! I swear, at one point in time then took the sanitizer water nozzle, pointed it at Katrina and I, and turned on the stupid flow! As well as splashing us endlessly. It took ages for anything to get done. And I took several (if not more) sponges upside the head. At one point I calmly picked up the sponge that had been thrown at me, walked over, and wrung it out over Clay's head. It was very pro of me. The counselors applauded. Oh- that reminds me. The counselors were standing by, LAUGHING at us as we got soaked!! Grr... \_/;;  And it was even worse. Viola Daniel had, at one point, gotten hold of a pair of tongs. And, instead of putting it in the sanitizer like anyone SANE would do, he started banging it against the metal sink rim singing at the top of his lungs, "Na na na na, na na, na na can't touch this!" AAARGH! I was dreeee-eeee-eeenched by the end of KP. Literally fscking dripping weeet. It pissed me off so badly T-T.   Day 4, Saturday - Bathroom duty. I had to do the toilets, which were surprisingly clean. So I was lucky. Now this gives me the perfect opportunity to describe the bathrooms.  They weren't BAD, per se.. but they could have been a hell of a lot better. There were 6 toilet stalls, only one having a lock that >worked   Day 5, Sunday - Inspirational. I had to draw a picture of someone who inspired me. So, I drew Boy. Okay, you're giving the monitor strange looks, but he's the reason I got into music in the first place! (He took up the trumpet in fifth grade while I was in third, I was jealous, by the summer after 3rd I had taken up the saxophone. Not exactly ideal, but..) So, that went well. Ish. Well-ish. Because we had to share in front of the rest of the camp.. But I found it amusing that almost all the boy cabins did skits while the girl cabins did artistic things. Heh-heh-heh.   Day 6, Monday - The first hike-by-number! With Kate and (I think) Ted we split into groups to do various activities. And so today was with Kate and.. Ted? I think. I think. So we played the Shadow Game. Two people had to work together to create shadows.. e_e; Boring.  Oh. And I think today was a musical.. but it might have been the second one o_O; People can sign up to play a piece in front of the rest of the camp. Yuss.   Day 7, Tuesday - Hike by number #2! I believe this was with our very own Lizzy and Jeff. We had to play this stupid counting game, where people try to count to twenty. People cannot indicate the order in which they go, and you cannot go at the same time as someone else. Veddy confusing. -_-;  During the lunch assembly the counselors taught us dance moves, since today was a dance. I'll list them, because they were really amusing.  'The Kate' a la Kate: Moving two fingers (disco style!) in random directions. 'The Mickey Mouse' a la Toshi: Stepping from one side to another. If very daring, adding a spin. 'The Security Guard' a la Brian: Arms crossed. Bored expression. Nod head to music. Look at watch occasionally. 'The Pogo Stick' a la Brian: Put hands at sides, palms downward.. pause.. JUMP LIKE CRAZY IN RANDOM DIRECTIONS!! 'The Shopping Cart' a la Toshi: Put hands out in front of self as if holding a bar. Walk along casually. Reach up and mimic pulling things down from shelves, putting them into a cart. Variant of The Shopping Cart.. 'The Shoplifter' a la Toshi: Nervously walk, looking around self. Grab items, stuff into jacket, run for it!! Variant of The Shopping Cart.. 'The Lawnmower' a la Toshi: Pull chain to start up lawnmower. Start walking along casually as if pushing a lawnmower. 'The Maniac' a la Liz: Put arms out in front of self, together. Bend over slightly. Run in place. 'The T-rex' a la Katy: Bring arms close to body, as if a tyrannosaurus rex. Two fingers on each hand, bent. Move one arm (and inadvertently whole shoulder) forward like attacking prey. Switch arms.  There were two dances during the session. Unfortunately, they didn't tell us, so I only had camping clothes to wear.. e_e; My first dance, eee! Yeah, I'm pathetic. But I haven't been to any of the school dances. And besides, I'm pretty much a flop when it comes to dancing. But I enjoyed myself, and yes.. loud music, it was nice enough.   Day 8, Wednesday - Hike by number #3! This was Brian (I think. Either Brian or Ted..) and Laurie. If that was her name.. >_>; Trust walk! It was amusing. You close your eyes and put your hands on the shoulders of the person in front of you. They do the same, you get the point. Then the person at the head of this (congo!) line, who has open eyes, leads the whole bunch on a hike. It was.. haaard. _._   And this was a musical, I think I think I think. If so it was the last one.. yes.   Day 9, Thursday - Hike by number #4!! With Tooooshi and Ana-banana! We had to sit in a circle and.. one by one.. go hug a tree. -_-;;;;;;; Then we had to say our name, where we come from, and our favorite band. THEN we had to say what the one thing we would change about ourselves is (Mine: procrastinating! You'll get a kick out of THAT, Sheep >_>). Fuuun, I guess.  ...And... Oi. Second dance.. I'm sort of leery putting this in, but.. *swallows pride and continues* So we were dancing in our little group, right? A slow song comes up. Then suddenly Taylor runs off without any before words right up to David the Tuba, who >every The only words that passed between us= Him (trying to break the awkward silence as we dance): Having fun? Me: I guess. Him (a bit later): So you play alto saxophone? Me: Yeah. I mean, could I be any more of a loser?! Uhh, well, anyway, I didn't meet his eyes the whole time, I was that mortified.. I mean, really. And at one point Toshi, who like the rest of the counselors is frolicking around trying to get everyone spirited, runs up to us and puts one hand on either of our shoulders. "Move closer!" Us: *does nothing* Toshi: *runs off* .....e_e;  For the rest of the dance I was so quiet and depressed it was scaring even me. (Taylor ended up pulling the 'SET PEOPLE UP WITHOUT ASKING THEM FIRST' thing on another of our friends.. then got angry cos people didn't want to be set up..) Uh, and anyway, when the second slow dance came up I was just milling around, and the OTHER David (the cool David who likes Cowboy Bebop and can Edwalk), the David Trumpet, was all "Uhh, so, who wants to dance with me?" Katrina looks at me, says "She does," then wanders off to dance with someone. So, I danced with the other David, which was sort of okay 'cos he's cool if not hawt. But he liked Gwen, not me, so.. sad Bekka T-T.  And.. that was that..   Day 10, Friday - The last hike by number, #5! We went with Kimi and Cormak down to the campfire, where we played chief. Pretty much there's a circle, with one person off to one side with eyes closed. A chief is chosen, and they start doing an action which everyone copies. The person who had their eyes closed comes back to the circle, trying to figure out who everyone is following. They have three guesses. And to make it harder the chief changes actions often. It was amusing enough.  We had KP again today... but with a different group of guys. We did KP with David the Trumpet's group, which was sort of okay.. heh-heh-heh, with Muscles the Stalker too. Um.. LESS MESSY. Thank you.  COCONUT BEAR NIGHT!! All session long our Cabin had been working on a skit, and we did it for Coconut Bear!! Our group, dubbed Oblique Moose 5, was SO cool. We did a scene, with different themes. Okay, here's the normal version:  Katrina: *walking in the 'forest'* Wow. Look at the trees, they're so green! The sky, it's so blue! I think I'll have a picnic. *sits* Taylor: *weaves her way over to Katrina* Sss! I am the snake! Sss! *uses hands to 'bite' Katrina* Chomp! *moves offstage* Katrina: Ouch, I'm bitten! I'm getting dizzy, I'm... *falls over* Gwen: *walks onstage* Hello? Katrina? Are you- ohmigosh! What happened? Are you okay? I'll call an ambulance! *pretends to call 911* Bekka: *waves arm above head as walks onstage* Weeooo weeooo weeooo! *pretends to step out of ambulance* What's the problem here? Gwen: She's been bitten by a snake! Bekka: Oh, this is very serious.. I'll take her pulse. *kneels and pretends to take pulse, then looks up* I think... I think she's dead... Katrina: *sits up* I'm not dead!  Then we did.. VALLEY GIRL VERSION! Katrina: *walks preppily into forest* Wow!! Look at the trees, they're like so.. uhh.. PURPLE!! Annie the tree: Thanks, but I'm green. Katrina: Oh, uh, green! And the sky, wow I feel really dizzy now.. Well like I need to eat because it's like lunchtime, hahaha! *sits* Taylor: Like Sss like ss I'm like the snake! I'm going to totally bite this person! Choo-ooomp! Katrina: Ow, that hurt! Wow, what's this red stuff? Hey, it looks good on me, hahahaa *falls over* Gwen: Hellllooooo? Like, heeee-llloooo? Like, what are you like doing like lying on the like ground? You're like going to like totally like ruin your hair like! Are you like okay? Like, are you like ookaaaayyy? *pause* I'm going to like call an ambu... and ambula.. and ambulalala.. a pharmacy car, like. *dials* Like, hello? I've got a serious problem like.. Yes.. Yes.. You guys don't know how much this like means to me.. Yes.. Nail appointment on Tuesday? You're a lifesaver! *hangs up and looks down at Katrina* Oh right, an ambu.. 911. *dials again* Hello like? My like friend is like hurt and like needs your help like. She's lying there like on the ground and like she's.. uh.. redding. She's redding. Thanks, byyyeee! *hangs up* Bekka: wooEEEEooEEEeEEo, wooEEeeoEEEeee! *hops over* What's the like, problem? Gwen: Like, it's YOOOU!! HIII! Bekka: Ahhh!! HiiiiIIIii!! Oh right, the like problem. Gwen: Oh, right, like she's just like there and like.. um. Bekka: Ooooh, that's baddd. She's lost a lot of blood. Gwen: Oooh, that's what it's called! Bekka; Yeeeaaah! *kneels and takes pulse* Oh oh.. I think she's like, a goner.. Gwen: Ohmigosh! But she'll like miss the like cheer competition! Katrina: *bolts up* OMYGAWD THE CHEER COMPETITION!!  Then we asked the crowd. They voted Pirate version. But I'll let you guys imagine that one o_o;! Everyone LOVED it! XD And we had done, when practicing, versions like Horror Movie, Monotone.. it was so fun.   Day 11, Saturday - Last day T-T Packed up, was DYING to see Boy  Parents again. They came, we concerted, then left. I MISS ALL OF THE OBLIQUE MOOSE 5!!!   First thing I had once returned to civilization: FRAPPACHINO!!!  -~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-  IMPROV Since I didn't include it above, I will here. On most days during lunch assembly, the counselors had an improv skit. Well, not skit. Improv game is more like it. I'll try and recall some- they were HILARIOUS.  Bus stop- This was probably my favorite. The point of it was two people sat, as if at a bus stop. You tried to make the other person laugh by having such an ODD quirk. So, first it was Toshi and Ana-banana. Toshi was acting all bipolar, calm one moment and screaming the next. I'm not sure what Ana was. Then finally they switched, and.. wull I don't quuuite remember. But up came Brian. Brian ROCKS. He was sitting there, hunched up a bit, pretending to very messily and strangely eat something. So someone comes up, sits. And Brian just looks over. And in serious the ODDEST voice ever: "Do you want an anchovy?" XD Like FIVE counselors attempted to go through that without laughing. Brian made 'em all laugh. Then STACY comes up and (this is hilarious). She walks up and starts talking. "Hello, I'm waiting for the bus so I can see the doctor. Because whenever I start to talk I people I just-" She falls over as if fainted then gets up "I just seem to-" falls over again, but has managed to hold onto 'bench' "Fall over and I can't quite-" has sat now, continues while staring at Brian "Quite seem to stop it I just-" She falls over, onto Brian XD It was SO hilarious. (Splat.. she was splatting.. o_o; )  Party- How to play: There's four people. Each person must have a mood like energetic, depressed, enraged, even constipated was one o_O. Just a mood. One of them is hosting a party. You choose what type of movie. So they're all acting they're mood when the first person knocks at the door. It's answered, and the new person comes in. Now BOTH people are acting like the mood of the new person. They talk for a bit, then another knock. The third person enters, and again there's a mood change. Same with the fourth. Then as one by one they leave, the mood switches to the third, to second, until it's only the first person acting as they had been. XD Very amusing.  Wull.. there's more but you don't need to hear about them.  -~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-  I'll end this with piccies.. cos I really don't want to do any more heavy typing.

Sometimes I know, that a part of you will show Deep in my eyes or in my smile. There will always be a part of you deep inside my heart And I'll know just when to let it go  And I was thinking maybe someday later down the road After all our stories have been told  I'll sit and think of you The dear friend I once knew Who shot through my life like a shooting star.....
