Ten days. I've grown to love Ypsilanti to tell you the truth. I've grown to love everything and everyone here. I'm going to be so torn when summer ends and everyone heads into their own little corners of life. But at the same time, it's selfish of me to believe that I'd be the reason for someone to stay.  My bags are just about fully packed, and Mr. LaRue sits beside me, sketching as usual. My head is prepared to leave, but my heart wants to stay. If I wasn't so happy with life this would be so much easier.   So the obvious would be to put these lyrics in here... so here we go.  I hate to wake you up to say goodbye. But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn. The taxi's waiting, he's blowing his horn, Already I'm so lonesome I could cry.  [Chorus] So kiss me and smile for me, Tell me that you'll wait for me, Hold me like you'll never let me go. 'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane Don't know when I'll be back again - Oh Babe, I hate to go.  There's so many times I've let you down, So many times I've played around, I tell you now, they don't mean a thing. Every place I go, I'll think of you, Every song I sing, I'll sing for you, When I come back, I'll wear your wedding ring.  [Chorus]  Now the time has come to leave you, One more time let me kiss you, Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way. Dream about the days to come. When I won't have to leave alone, About the times I won't have to say ...  [Chorus]  I love you all and I'll be thinking about each and every one of you... even if you think I hate you, life couldn't be as beautiful as it is without your presence.
