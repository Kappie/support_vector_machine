Things were as expected; the top swimmers finished first, the dog napped in front of the screen door, the cats slept in their favorite apartment nooks. Just a regular day.  Then I caught a glimpse of a toad hopping by the cement slab that floors my patio. Odd, I thought, that a toad would be meandering about on such a wet and dreary day. He hopped with vigor, slinging his chubby body forward. I wondered what his plan was. Why was he so intent on getting closer to my bicycle?  After several thrusts forward, he aimed himself toward the rear tire. I thought he might decide to jump over the tire and through the spokes. After all, I did just see him navigate the legs of the lawn chair with ease. Then, the strangest thing happened; the toad walked. He hoisted his body up and waddled away. He reminded me of a turtle. His round torso rocked back and forth as his short, stubby, bow legs worked. Then he stopped. I watched for a while longer, but he had gone as far as he wanted. Apparently the task of jumping the tire was a bit too daunting.  I guess that some risks are worth taking, and some are better left for another day.
