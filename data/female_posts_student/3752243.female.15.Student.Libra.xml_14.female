I would recap what I have been up to, but that would boar you to tears, I mean it. I will tell you what I did today, I went and saw Anchorman with Taryn, Krista, and Sarrah. It was hilarious, I mean it was an "Afternoon Delight!" ha ha ha the whit, I mean it ozzes from me. I am again excited a mundo. Here is why, I am going to Eva's cottage again on Wednesday for 3 days, which I am totally looking forward to. I love her cottage! It is so cozy and nice and such. I got my hair cut today, it is all layery with some bangage, but not really you see. I like it so do friends, mommy is not it's biggest fan, but I will get over that. Well I guess the thing is she needs to get over it due to the fact that it is my hair,and not hers. I think I make logic. I saw confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, and Dirty Dancing Havana Nights, both very very good. Personally I liked DD2 the best. Two reasons. 1. The dancing is sooo crazy nuts, I am debating weather or not to take ballroom. 2. I know get the obsession my friends have with Diego Luna. He is on my top 5 list fo shiz. Well I am going to go now. Hoccha. Author:Eve
