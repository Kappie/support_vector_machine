The cats looked worried.  I crept into the hall nervously, hand twitching slightly as I reached for the light switch. Something was moving. Lots of somethings. The kitchen was writhing in the darkness. Pat. Rustle. Whirrrr.  I flicked on the light and gasped, the cats at my heels leaped backward and ran away in terror.  No less than  fifty  enormous, black, scrabbling B-52 cockroaches covered the kitchen. Easily 3 - 4 inches long apiece, they were on the ceiling, on the counter, skittering across the cabinet fronts, in the sink, flying through the air. All  were frantically crawling over each other, knocking over cereal boxes, opening cupboard doors, and eating with our cutlery. When they saw me, half a dozen lit off and flew straight at my head, fluttering like chickens. I ducked and weilded my weapon, a feather duster, smacking them out of the air with tiny muffled  thwacks . One clung to the feathers and ran for my fingers, but I flung the duster, roach and all, into the jaws of our bravest cat, the fearless Headlights the Kitten.   The first blow has been struck. Now we go to war. We have tried poisons, we have tried starvation, but I have found that the most effective means of disposing of roaches is to place empty cans of soda strategically about the house, and then simply throw them away in the morning when they are full of heavy, scratching, trapped roaches.   I don't know where they go during the day, but at night they hold a cockroach jamboree, which would be absolutely magical and delightful to witness if they were fairies instead of giant roaches. Really, life is not fair.  This is Harry, one of our actual cockroaches (in actual size):
