I think it'd be best musically if we just didn't use Mark or Ryan, but the hardest part is actually telling them. Ryan's probably using the "maybe' strategy now to make me feel like he's too good for it, but little does he know that we've got a greater plan for him. It's so much more peaceful with just Tiff and Andrew (I almost typed in Tiff and Ryan, since that used to be the old trio...) around. I don't know what to do. I really want this to continue not so much for just college bragging rights now but because it stands for two things I really care about. Too bad that it doesn't seem like other people share my passion. I spent $15 today on copies and binders...that's an hour of tutoring. I still can't console myself that it was ok and everything's gonna be all right (break into song) but the truth is, I don't want to deal with it. It was perfectly fine with just TIff and Andrew around, but with Heather and Mark and Ryan it's virtually impossible to function.  Anyways. Went out to Mandarin Wok for dinner. It's one of those places where you don't go because it's a fantastic restaurant but because it serves Chinese food and your family knows the menu by heart. The classic beef noodle soup (almost spelt it soop) and then fried fish with ginger and salt (and peppers), and then beef with tomatoes. Thanks, Enid. Now I've forgotten how to spell "tomato."  And now I'm back at the compy trying to do math hw, except it occurred to me that I might as well unload. I blocked Ryan for the first time in relative history today, and the funny thing is, I don't feel bad at all. And then I unblocked him and was incorrigibly pessimistic, just like HE is sometimes.  Maybe we should take Andrew out for a Pick Up Stix and Barnes and Noble excursion, followed by a spin in the world-famous dizzy chair to initiate him.  Damn it, I just lost part of the post b/c I tried to copy paste. Yeah right.  When I grow up, I dream of being a layout editor on a newspaper or a magazine. I just love that feeling of control. But then again, journalism makes me sad sometimes. Perhaps on that day Keira is off tutoring and Melody has something to do and Brandon has a job (one of many) and Jonathan has Girlfriend Day or something, and it's just me. Bret annoys the heck out of me sometimes...he thinks he's so funny. But maybe I'm just such a sourpuss that I'm an ideal butt end of jokes. It's just--nobody seems to be so into this kind of thing, except maybe Jonathan. I wish Jess was still around in 42E after hours.  The next time anyone uses "everyday" to mean "every day" or "every day" to mean "everyday" I will go after someone with Andrew's switchblade. It's all over the media. What are these people thinking? Are they trying to infuse grammar chaos upon the unknowing American population? Damn them all.  I still have the taste of fortune cookie and orange in my mouth. You know how at Chinese places they always send you a plate of fortune cookies and orange slices with the bill? I hate the combination in my mouth. It tastes like pre-barf. Yup.  So yeah. I was trying to find the square root key and ended up on blogger. Go figure.
