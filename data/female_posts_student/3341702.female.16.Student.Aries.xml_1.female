But yeah..I did take my promotion at work...so I'm gonna be workin this thursday at 4 and then on saturday at 4:30. So I'll be getting less hours, but getting paid more. yay! *dances* But I'm not gonna be able to hang out with Jeremie cuz...yeah..he'll be in the dining room. ;.; *sigh* oh well..at least I'll have enough money on my next paycheck to buy myself that GBA sp that I want...and Fire Emblem...*drools* I'm so pitiful..I'm obsessed with Fire Emblem...^^;  Anywayz..notta much is really going on...I broke down at work yesterday...cuz I had really wanted to go home, and the guy who got there half an hour after me got cut right after he got there, so I had to work my full 4-something hours. It sucked..cuz my manager had to take me into one of the garden rooms so I could cry in peace...cuz, yeah...I had to keep going in the kitchen so I could cry.  But..that's all I'm gonna write right now...baiobaio.
