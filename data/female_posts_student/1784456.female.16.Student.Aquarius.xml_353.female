You're still funding their company and it'll keep going longer because of you, so in actual fact you are. WOW! Now doesn't that make you feel great?! Sorry, I'm just angry at my brother for having the tv on so I can't go to sleep. Anyway, some one has to burst Izzy's bubble otherwise every one might be happy for a change! (Shock horror, unheard of) Hasn't every one always got some thing to complain about or is it just me?
