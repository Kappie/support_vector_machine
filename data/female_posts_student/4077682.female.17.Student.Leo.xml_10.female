You can make a suggestion, or a decision and if people don't agree then it's not the end of the world right? So we should all be a little less goddamn polite. Believe me, I'm the worst. But if society doesn't give a shit about anything anymore, then why care about making the wrong suggestions?       I wish that people could never hurt each other's feelings. We were all at the fireworks tonight, and my friend decided to call my boyfriend. That is totally cool, I mean, why wouldn't I want to talk to him. But I think he felt like we were trying to make him feel bad for not being there. And that was DEFF not my intentions. hmm so much trouble! but things usually get happier in the morning i hope.
