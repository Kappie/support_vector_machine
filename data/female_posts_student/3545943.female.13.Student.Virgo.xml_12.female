But when I think about my dreams, I can usually dissect them into portions, and I understand where each part came from, like if I was thinking about my friends they might appear in my dream, et cetera.  And dreams usually have an underlying feeling.  Like fear.  Nightmares usually have an underlying base in fear.  When I was younger, I used to have nightmares about being chased by a monster or a cloaked figure.  My fear was death.  It was something I (obviously) hadn't experienced.  But now I don't fear death.  In fact, the idea appeals to me sometimes.  And I don't have those dreams anymore.  I also often had a re-occuring dream in which I was with my family and there were small monsters running around.  They scared me, and I tried to escape but my family just laughed.  But in that dream, death wasn't my fear.  It was me being upset that my family wouldn't take me seriously.  So if you want to test my dream-interperating abilites, maybe you've got a story to tell me.  I haven't had a nightmare in ages.  Does that mean I'm fearless?  Not on a small scale, no.  But on a larger plane, perhaps.
