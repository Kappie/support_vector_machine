Friday was really cool- a lot of people came out to the bar ( and I will be putting pictures in my pics for yahoo, dont worry) It was really really packed and everybody had a good time. We went shopping Saturday so I could find some more hoochie-mama clothes- I got a new barbell with a french tickler on top *waggles her eyebrows* not that anybody's really gonna ever y'know.... We went shoppin Sunday for new bathing suits- I found a lime green and blue one that matches my barbell perfect. Um, we went to the lake Sunday too. but Saturday? My friend Dan finally came out to the bar and sure enough... dickhead Scott had to be a bitch. He flicked ashes on him (I hope it was an accident, but i"m almost sure it wasnt) was threatenin to beat him up, just bein plain wrong to him for no reason. It was pissin me off, so I got me a shot of tequila, went over and asked if I could punch him, and punched him for all the things he'd done. He said it didnt hurt, so he got slapped a couple times too. Told me I was violent Sunday morning. Sunday, we went to Jans, and of course Dan came out 'cause that's his bar that he hangs out at. My Monya friend met a new one and he's awesome. I really hope things work out... We all went to Angelo's where I had to get beat up by Dan :P just playin. Rae's boyfriend busted her eye open and so I got a phone call at about 3 from her letting me know- she got 11 stitches in her eye. Douglas Queen, you are sooo in trouble. He told me it was my responsibility when he beat her ass, well I guess that makes it my job to take care of him for putting his hands on her too, right? Well, yesterday was Monday. I told Lori I need someone to play cupid for me and she told me the guy for me was right in front of my face... talking about Dan. Someone else who's never even met him told me I was going to marry him. We're not like that and I dont have any kind of feelings like that for him, so what they're seeing that I dont is beyond me. I dont see it happening in a million years. Guys like that dont happen to girls like me. I might be cute to some of you, but as far as I know, I am definitely not hot enough to snag someone that looks good. I'm so glad right now that he wont see this 'cause he'd get all freaked out prolly.. NObody understands that I have alot of guy friends and we're strictly platonic. NOBODY. I gotta go to class. laters *hugs and kisses*
