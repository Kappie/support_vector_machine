So i decide im going to continue on that. But it wont be directly on annoying bitchy people.     See this planet... It needs a name... How about Planet of the Freaks, Staring Freaks! . Yes that is what it shall be.   Planet of the freaks has an assortment of people. Freaks are what the people are called. You see the freaks are well, you know freaks. This is a planet we all live on. But a planet that is different from all others. It’s a lot like Earth, but it isn’t. It couldn't be. Earth is supposed to be perfect down to every single detail controlled by someone else, you are puppet.   The planet of freaks is far from perfect. We control our own actions, and make our own futures. We turn which direction we want to. We sing, say, the way we want to. There may not be a problem with this, and it may sound perfect, a "Free" land. Do what you want type deal. But Planet of the Freaks is not perfect remembering this.  See whatever you do, you have to be careful, to make sure someone isn't watching you say or do this and that. You are judged by all that you do. And your actions, what you say are looked down by others; it isn't good enough to the other freaks. Freaks stay in there own groups, whether it is a high class group (which still is not perfect), middle class or a low class group. Every single freak is picked on, in the little simplest ways. Freaks die, freaks starve, freaks kill, freaks judge, freaks drink, do drugs, freaks litter, freaks cry, rant, freaks are sometimes happy (usually you don’t find this sort). This Planet of Freaks doesn't seem so wonderful does it? All freaks need a place to escape to, a place to be alone. But not on this planet. There is no escaping.   At this point earth seems like a distant wonderful place compared to the Planet of the Freaks. But you see there is one small detail if you haven't figured it out. Earth if you look deep inside is not perfect, you are still controlled by a puppet to everyone. Earth is the Planet of Freaks.    Hannah  Yes that may not make sense. But eh does it look like I care?
