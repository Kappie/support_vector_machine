But this reminds me of something James told the youth group a while ago- about getting a spiritual high after accepting Christ at an alter call, and then a week later do everything the same way. I wonder how many kids do that from Camp...I know that I used to. Go to camp and 'be spiritual' but then the week I got home- nothing would be the same.  People have been on my mind a lot lately. While I was up in Seattle, and I saw people I started looking past their appearence and started thinking about their eternal destination. Wondering if they believed in anything, and if it was Jesus...or if they had been disappointed by Christians and Jesus and God...  It's starting to freak me out...but I can't stop. This will probably be on my mind at camp as well. When I'm surrounded by Christians, I might end up doubting them, thinking them only 'week Christians' who are true christians for the week and then return to their normal lifestyle after camp.  I really shouldn't do that...right? Because the judging is up to Jesus Christ. Not to me. But I'm not going up to random people and asking if their true christians or not...but still- i find this a little 'off' and wrong.  Lets hope I'll remember this at Camp.
