Working on my assignment about child abuse, nearly finished it, and then I can finish all my homework by today. Ya,I will  burn the midnight oil  to do all my homework, so that I can have more time to study. Exam is coming soon, need to work hard. Economics tuition teacher told us 'we won't know how smart we are, until we finally sit down to study'. Ya, that's really true. Form six life is all about the STPM examination; good result =IPTA. Ofcourse, I learned a lot of new things in form six, especially things about Business and Economics. Both subjects are interesting!   I love form six!        Actually I want to share my MUET assignment with other STPM or SPM students out there(if only there's people out there who read my blog anyway). Ithink sharing is thegreatest art in life. We give and take and give and take. This routine run over and over again,then human beings interact with each other, they share the information and after a few routine of this, they begin to share their happiness and laughter together. That's really touching, isn't it?    Ah, I'm seriously don't know what the hell I'm talking about, blah blah blah...
