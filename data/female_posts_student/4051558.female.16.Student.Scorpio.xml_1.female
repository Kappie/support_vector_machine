I mean this is my second post in like 2 hours. Insane right? Anywho, UI guess I'm just bored, and I do random stuff when I'm bored. I'm hoping to get at job at the library, and I have an aplication to fill out, only thing is, i've never done that so I have no clue how to do it. But my mom said she'd help me out after I did all I could.       It can get pretty boring just waiting for stuff. Oh, I found my knitting. I was looking through my closet and I found a scarf that I had been working on around february, and then my grandma got sick so I had to put it away for a while and then I just forgot it was there. Really stupid right? Anyways, started working on it again. I even brought it with me here to the library.
