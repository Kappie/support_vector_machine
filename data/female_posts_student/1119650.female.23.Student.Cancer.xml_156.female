For instance there is a very high terrorism warning that was issued this past weekend for our country, but for New York City in particular.  I spent my whole weekend on the city and the alert was issued for soft targets: hotels, subways, apartment buildings, etc.  Basically just places with low security and high body counts.    Anyhow, I get onto the subway and I notice this guy get on.  I notice him initially because he was very good looking.  He sits down across from my friend and I.  I see something on his backpack that catches my eye.  A  urlLink Palestinian Flag  patch surrounded by some arabic style writing.  My friend was talking to me, but I just kept staring at this guy, staring at the backpack, wondering if this was America's first suicide bomber.  I wanted to whisper to my friend that we should get off the train, but I didn't want the guy to see me say anything.  Obviously it ended up being nothing, but I'm scared of myself for even thinking like that.  I'm scared that even if I was thinking of something like that I was too paralyzed to go do anything about it.  I'm scared that I don't trust people anymore.  Im scared that I have to live in this stupid fear.  Im scared that I'm not one of those people who can just throw their caution to the wind and just party.
