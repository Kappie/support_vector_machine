Joy is finding happiness in something even when everything else seems poopie...Get it? heh i didn't think so, but i understand it... Let tell yal' something that has been on my mind alot latlly.. My looks. Now i am trying not to make a big deal of it. But i dont like my stomack. i seem to be getting...bigger... Not to the place where i'm like a cow but i sure do feel like it. Its poopie! Well do something about it Cassy if you dont like it so much... Yea i know, i'm just lazy. I mean thats what got me hear in the first place.    Well i had a great day to tell yal' the truth. i didn't do anything, just played games with Rick, talked to Kyle and Ed...Ed by the way called me a sang to me... awww.... What a sweet heart. It wasn't that bad either. Kyle was on for the first time in about a week. I asked why, seeing how he wasn't going to come on till Friday. But he said he just wanted to talk. So, i was happy. No really, i was sooo excited to talk to him. I love talking to him. i really didn't talk much when he was on cause i was playing a game with Rick and mostly Ed needed to talk about something that he has been having hard time with latly.    As for last nights post, its what i was feeling. I felt like crap. And half of me still feels like i am unwothy of alot of my friendship. But God died for me, he say me as being worth it... So i should know that, and he choose me to have these relationships.. And i'm loving it! The beauty in it all...   I read Jerred X thingy, and he has a new girlfriend, Ashley... How awesome, she sounds like someone he can, and already has, fallen in love with... I'm happy for him... Which is weird. He has always been my weakness. And i mean that! i would have done anything to be with this guy, but when he wanted to be with me, i wouldn't go for it. Mostly cause i knew it was wrong... but last night i really thought thati could just call him and get back together. Which sadly, i didn't want. lol... I really didn't want to. but my lustful thoughts did. I mean they were screaming! But i didnt. And when i woke up this morning i spent alittle time with my God and it was a true Joy... A new life... and it was a blessing.    Rick i just wanted to put something in here for you... I love you. Now the truth is i hate saying that, causei have lost the meaning of that with so many other people. But i do love you. And thank you, and Thank God for you everyday... Thank you so much for my mine... Naked kisses!!!!
