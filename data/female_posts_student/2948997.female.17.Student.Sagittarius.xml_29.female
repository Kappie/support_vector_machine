When I get the chance to interact with certain people I realize that I should be happy to be who I think I am. There are always thoughts of my past, reflections of who I thought I once was and solutions I felt would fix everything.  Today as I walked through the card section of Superstore, I stumbled across the "With Our Deepest Sympathy" I felt a twinge of what would have happened if those pills really had killed me. Would my sister have recieved cards in honour of her pathetic big sister who felt that she couldn't handle the world? Would my parents have recieved gotti flowers and such? Would my friends have thought about the lack of me, and then figured "screw it". Then I snapped out of this thought, and just walked on to the cooking chicken section. It's strange how certain events still trigger the deepest memories in your mind. I do not believe that I am sucidal but I can honestly admit that I am clinically depressed which seems like a cope out some days. Days when all I want to do is lie in bed and cry, eat ice cream and tell everyone to fuck off...who knows.   The Future is Fake   An interesting quote that I found in the book I'm currently reading. True.  My deepest fear, is not public speaking, spiders of bugs, but actually people and their emotions and their baggage. People scare me but there are certain people that I adore. I am glad I have this oppurinity to go through this change in me because it feels like something that needs to be done. Another interesting point about my life, is that I've never had the same friends for more than three years...which I'm a little nervous about considering that this is my third year of YP approaching.   I think the best thing that I've heard all day was just to not get involved in the bullshit cause thats what it is. Believe in who you are as a person and well, you'll have to depend on yourself to get yourself across the galaxy.  There are some people in this world that do not recieve the full amount of credit they deserve, and I feel I've found someone like this which I haven't been kind enough to. I apolgize for whatever harm I may have caused, but thank you for your kindness. ...Remember when....  There are some people that I would like to talk to eventually but I refuse to push it. I am sitting here waiting, no for you only but for a chance of talking, a chance to spend time with you.   ....Remember when...  My eyes are getting slighty sore and I think it's time to crawl into bed.
