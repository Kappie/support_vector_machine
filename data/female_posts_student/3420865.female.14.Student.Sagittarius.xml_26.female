"now, michaelangelo, about this "last supper" painting..."-priest "what's wrong with it? don't you like the kangaroo?"-michaelangelo "kangaroo?! there was no kangaroo at the last supper!"-priest "oh, no problem. i'll just make him into a deciple."-michaelangelo "ah. now that's the problem..."-priest "what's the matter with the deciples?"-michaelangelo "...there's 28 of them."-priest "...too many?"-michaelangelo "of course it's too many! there were 12 deciples at the last supper, no kangaroos and  one  christ!"-priest " one ?!"-michaelangelo "yes! one! not three!"-priest "what? but i like it the way it is... the fat one kindof evens out the two skinny ones."-michaelangelo  ahahahaha. wow that's funny.  "hi, i'd like to have an argument, please."-man "ok, please go to room 12."-woman at desk "ok, thank you."-man *opens wrong door.*"hello."-man "what the hell do you want, you bastard?! get out of my face you tight git."-man at desk "...uh... is this where i have the argument?"-man "oh, sorry. this is abuse! you want room 12A, next door."-man at desk  ahahaha. woot. there are so many other quotes... but i can't remember them.  well, i'm outtie now. paice.  your dead fad is a disaster- your fashion is my fucking cancer.  kayte.
