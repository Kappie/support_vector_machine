This sober, jazz inspired album is excellent for those cold long winter nights with a glass of red vine and good company. Beth Gibbons’ inhabits an amazing and powerful voice that often is not taken advantage of on Portishead’s releases. There is nothing wrong with her song writing abilities either and this is truly one of those albums that one should have in one’s record collection.
