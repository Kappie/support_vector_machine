I really dont see the point in Sundays.I know its like the 'day of worship', but it shouldnt mean that most shops are shut, and that theres absolute crap on tv.I mean, who really wants to watch the likes of 'antiques roadshow',and 'songs of praise'?.      I suppose it shows you how little there is to do in life.      Enough of me drowning on, lets think *happy thoughts*.      Well i'd like to say that the sun is shinning, and the birds are singing, but due to the unformidable British weather...its not.Instead, the sky is grey and i think the birds must be oversleeping  (either that or they have all mysteriously died).       Strange really...      So for now my little chums,Goodbyb.      XxXx          urlLink      Image by  urlLink FlamingText.com
