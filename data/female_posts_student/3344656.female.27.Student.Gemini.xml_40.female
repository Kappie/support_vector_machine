I paid most of my bills.  I am currently uploading more pix from the Copper Circus Arts show I went to a month ago, and am more than 2/3 done. This has taken FOREVER because of big files, slow dial-up, and I'm still too afraid to try it at work.  I put gas in the car.  I brushed the dog, and helped him shed enough hair to make a second dog. About cocker spaniel sized.  I played with a real cocker spaniel at my aunt's house.  That's all I did today.  Yesterday when I got to work there was the most unusual message I've ever received waiting for me: "Heather, can you please Ben? Thx, V" So, I found Vicki and asked what the heck did Ben say to her to leave me that message, and isn't that a weird one to leave with another person? She forgot the verb "call" thus making "please" the verb. I'm still undecided if I should share this with Ben. I called him, though, and he was going on a run and wanted to know if he should get me anything. I said yes. I'm uncertain if my "yes" pleased him. But my ego makes me assume it did.
