He sai dhe was different, and didn't like expressing his feelings to people, he doesn't like sharing his emotions to the world...so i just asked him simply to tell me if he liked me...and he said i knew the answer,and i said i sorta do, but i wanna know the actual answer instead of assuming, he never ended up telling me but he made it clear i guess. Heres the convo for those who care:  matt says: no need to get stressed now is there baby {OuT iF nEeDeD cAlL 905-580-9982}   WoO hOo VaL's AlL tAnNeD!    ¦-¦óÔ«ér ©¦-¦¡¢«   AsIaN/iRiSh  PrIdE! says: the longer that your taking tonot tell me i dont' think you like me....at this point i think you don't me, and thats what i'm going by {OuT iF nEeDeD cAlL 905-580-9982}   WoO hOo VaL's AlL tAnNeD!    ¦-¦óÔ«ér ©¦-¦¡¢«   AsIaN/iRiSh  PrIdE! says: and yes there is a reason to get stressed matt says: think what u like val matt says: why would i bother txtin matt says: c mon online when im fucking fucked matt says: talkin on mic matt says: why would i bother doing these things matt says: its not like i have all the time in the world to waste on a person i dont even like matt says: u get the drift {OuT iF nEeDeD cAlL 905-580-9982}   WoO hOo VaL's AlL tAnNeD!    ¦-¦óÔ«ér ©¦-¦¡¢«   AsIaN/iRiSh  PrIdE! says: but then it makes me think cause your probably doing the same thing to other people i don't know if yout talking to other people you know matt says: i talk to no one online matt says: im never online unless im talkin to u matt says: i have about 9 contacts matt says: 3 of which only ever come online {OuT iF nEeDeD cAlL 905-580-9982}   WoO hOo VaL's AlL tAnNeD!    ¦-¦óÔ«ér ©¦-¦¡¢«   AsIaN/iRiSh  PrIdE! says: ......and the other 6? matt says: just kinda linger there on my account matt says: doing nothing matt says: i dont use the net like i used to back in the day val matt says: i only come on to check my mail matt says: which is from u most the time matt says: n if u are online i stay and chat matt says: if not then i go  so that was what he said to me...so i guess its safe to assume then?  *shurgs* i dunno...but yeah...so we left that subject alone...but i dunno...we got to talking...we talked about drugs lol...an odd conversation...i dunno...it was still nice though...fustrating cause my mom's sleeping so ihad to be quiet and his voice kept cutting in and out...a little fustrating but meh! i'm still happy...
