MOE ROCKS!!! haha. aiight..sue me....mwaha! Went through the o level chinese paper today..quite badly done sia. for my batch of scripts, majority failed and scrapped through the passing mark. the minority scored higher than 55/80. i'm quite worried about next year when it comes to our turn.   YESTERDAY  was the  ROD  for our unit's NPCC. haha. seniors weipo, yati and bernard graduated from our unit's NPCC le..haha. 3 cheers for our kick-arse seniors! * woot !* i'm very happy for them! and i'll miss them heaps!!  yati, bernard  and  weipo  rocks my socks!!! jiayou in the future CI courses!  I'll post the pictures up as soon as i upload them all :)
