He turns into a mouse when hugged by girls.  He's the guy with silver hair.  He is extremely kind but seems to keep most of his feelings to himself.  When Tohru shows up, she manages to soften his heart with her kindness and he becomes less afraid of people.  Kyo--> The guy with orange hair.  He's bad tempered and absolutely hates Yuki (they're rivals).  Somehow, he always gets his butt kicked by Yuki.  He turns into a cat when hugged.  He gradually learns how to be more caring and how to interact with people.  Tohru Honda--> She's the girl in the middle.  She's really nice but kind of stupid and clueless.  She thinks everyone is a good person.  She usually runs into walls and falls down the stairs because she's absent- minded.  She really cares about Yuki and Kyo.  I really adore this anime.  It was really cute and had extremely interesting characters that intrigued me.  The story is about a girl named Tohru Honda who has recently lost her mother in a car accident and is living by herself in a tent.  She unknowingly set up her tent right in the middle of Souma property.  As soon as the Souma Family finds out, they invite her to live in their house with them.  Suddenly, Tohru discovers the Souma family's biggest secret.  When hugged by the opposite sex, they turn into chinese zodiac animals.  Tohru now lives with the family but if she ever tells the secret or someone else finds out, she might have her memory erased.
