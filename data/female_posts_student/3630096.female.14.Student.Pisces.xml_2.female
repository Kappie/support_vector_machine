You couldn't feel a thing - and you were out of breath. That was like...hell.    Today was much much much more better! [but my legs are still aching like hell] I set up an instrument, my previous clarinet and used Jaslyn's unused reed [after fall in of course]. Haha. When I reached school around 6.45am and almost everywhere was in darkness. It felt so cold... I went straight to the direction of the bandroom and saw no source of light. So I strolled over to the canteen. My eyes immediately lit up with the encouraging smile of Nizam... Trust me! He's so shuai!! =). haha. Such a pity that he is a malay...haiz. It's so difficult to find a guy with good looks, good grades, good behavoir and character, and humour most importantly! He fitted the conditions exactly, but too bad, he's a malay...haiz haiz haiz...    The sec1s had 2.4km run today so they all went off. Good luck! And they all passed...yay. So we had sectionals afterwards when Mr Ong realised there's not going to be a rehersal today. So nizam took over as usual and he was torturing us! Majulah Singapura! We are Singapore! One people, one nation, one Singapore! Wah...haiz. And Andre came back today! Omg. He looked  so  different! he's no longer that duckling! When the sec1s came back, they looked as if they were going to faint right on that moment. Napha was such a torture.    AHH! [Before I actually forgot it. You know what!? Qiuming sat with Jaslyn today! With no juniors in between...hahaha....memorable day eh??]    During Sectionals, Peggy was very strict with us. I could actually see her eyes burning with fire... Oh no. What I like about Peggy is the force which Elaine can never give. The force, those kind of force that push us forward and very on going. Huilin and Vivian came back sia... Ooops. That was  so....scary .   When it was finally full band, we threw all the songs aside and played made in Singapore!! YAHHOOOO! LOL. It's the nicest song I ever heard...and I remembered the first time when I ever heard it during the encore...    On that day, Jaslyn actually called me to inform that there was a open air philharmonic winds concert at yew tee and Elaine encouraged us to go for it. Since it was senior's orders, I had no choice. Till the end of the whole programme, the audience was very attentive. Mr Ong is the mc [in-charge]!! Woohoo! So we yelled for encore and this was the song they had played.    and so we played. The mood was jumpy and bouncy, happy and bright! Lively! Nizam was actually skipping with the instructions of Mr Ong, which made us all laugh like madness....haha. It was a great sight to see. After that, was the end of band. I wanted to borrow the instrument, but I couldn't. It was not  my  instrument now...Fall in and then...a lot of people pump. I didn't know why, but there was so many people, flutes, trumpets, admins, french horns... It was a terrible sight to see our dear student conductor pump, especially when we had seen him before, about to faint and he couldn't support himself and had to be supported in between amin and farhan...omg.   Went to lot 1 with Jaslyn, bought long john silver and  disappeared  right after that.....................
