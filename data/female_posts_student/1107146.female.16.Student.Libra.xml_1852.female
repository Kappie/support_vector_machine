Don't look it up, by the way. Just don't.  My god. The prognosis is acid reflux to the extent of death, pretty much. Remember how I used to talk about the "burning" that I would get around my heart when I was upset, back in the EMO days of, say, 12 months ago? It was actually acid creeping in during times of stress. So getting rid of it will, in effect, get rid of a lot of depression problems (they gave me Nexium, the little purple pill...everyone seems to know it when I say "the little purple pill", so hopefully that will help).  It also explains why I'm such a liquid Nazi, especially when it comes to Cokes. Every time I drink one, it stops the burn for a few minutes. Altho I sort of took it to the addict level. And the acidics in the Coke made the acidics in the pit worse. Hence, seriously, no more carbonation.  Speaking of addict...OPIUM.   I think that's all that need be said to that effect. Sharing...hahahahahahhahahahaha. Oh, my. It's a good thing I'm/we're not (a) druggie(s). What a confusing grammatical psychobabble. Today was "it's time to stop being high, faggot" day. That means I had to come back down and touch earth. Damn.   The drugs apparently didn't work because of all the caffeine...I drank so much Coke that I've stimulated my body to tolerate heavier substances. I don't blame them, but I wasn't too keen on the getting the hell ripped out of my throat part because they didn't know what else to do with some kid gagging to death. Shit, they acted like this had never happened before.  And I got my just desserts for Helen Kellering. Aye.
