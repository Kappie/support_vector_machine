My aura is BLUE!!!  ----Don't worry blue doesn't mean a life full of sorrow.But those with blue auras are some of the most emotional people on the planet.Blue's are quite sensitive to other peoples feelings-they can cry at the drop of a hat even if they sence another person's pain.They use their incredible intuition to help other people whenever and however they can--by feeding their bodies or lifting their spirits. If you are an empathetic people person who finds satisfaction in giving love and caring for other people surrounded by a blue aura.--- Yes that is my aura...and i kinda believe it too. I'm not afraid to admit that i am very emotional with things.But the funny thing is is that I try to help people with problems and i can't even solve my own! lol  Also on the job thing...my possible jobs are  consultant psychologist-yes!!! speech pathologist entrepreneur actor teacher counselor massage therapist-hehe i already do that lol politician or diplomat->? writer or journalist television reporter-neat computer programmer,systems anyalist or computer specialist-umm...okay? scientist-uh..no engineer-cool
