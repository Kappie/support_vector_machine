I left school with my brain in serious need of a trip to the emergency room. Yet I haven't stopped studying since I got home this afternoon at three. Needless to say my brain is pretty close to dead right now.  No I'm not a freak at least not in that sense, I'm just trying to haul butt and get my grade up before the end of the year.  So excuse me while I crack my skull trying to finish my work on conics and make up a little song with so many curse words they haven't even been invented yet...  Dit..shuck..famnit  hey this is fun!
