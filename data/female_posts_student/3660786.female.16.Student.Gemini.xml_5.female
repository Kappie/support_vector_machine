I was going to Biology, and some really weird kid with a mullet, wanted me to sign his yearbook, and he wanted my phone number... I gave it to him, except the last number was wrong... Smooth. Then all these little friends of his wanted me to sign theirs too. I remember thinking, "When did I become famous!?" but hey, it's kind of cool, maybe I look like a celebrity, could I pass for Nicole Kidman? No. Oh well, I don't care, as long as I don't look like a porn star or something.  Also, I took my turtle for a walk. I think he misses Greece as much as I do. I wish I could go back and watch the Olympics, but I have commitments here, Dance and High School. School here doesn't get out until June 23. Wow. All because of some snow in December. I had never seen snow before I moved here. It was cold, and slightly painful, I hope it never does that again.  I have a big German Final tomorrow... AY! I know Greek, Italian, and English to an art, but I can speak German worth shit. Oh well, I have a C in that class and if I fail this it'll be a D. I would have a 4.0 if it weren't for that class.  I think I am going to quit now, I will update again tomorrow. Jees, I have 3 blogs, 2 on www.Xanga.com, and one on here. I am going a little crazy now, woo!
