I will be escorting the guests down these eletgant stairs in front of all of the other seated guests.  This ship really reminds me of the titanic and everytime i think about being onboard I think of that damned ship. Weird.  anyway, I am excited about tonight. I am going to take a nap this afternoon as I will be working until after midnight tonight. I have to host the "Grand Buffet" at 11:30PM and introduce all of the international chefs. Wish me luck on name pronounciation.   So, thanksgiving isn't really being celebrated on board. In fact, I had completely forgotten about the holiday until I received an email from Jennifer this morning. I hope everyone has a great holiday break and eats lots of food. Good food. The officer messroom food is yuck and makes me have owie tummy. (Dannielle  Christina know what this is).   We have two days at sea so we areactually right now about 750 miles south of San Diego. We will arrive at that port on Friday morning and will pick up new passengers!   wots of wuv, Shell
