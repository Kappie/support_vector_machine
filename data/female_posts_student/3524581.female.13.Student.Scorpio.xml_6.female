BET, black entertainment channel, now this really dosn't seem fair, i mean we could'nt create a  white  entertainment channel, could we? we'd get sued or something! and at school one day, i reffered to someone ans that  black  kid over there and got in trouble, and then he called me a cracker and didn't get in any trouble. i mean, does anyone else notice how unfair this is, i'm all for racial equality and all and they act like they are but are they really?
