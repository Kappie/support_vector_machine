We watched some of Harry Potter en Espanol in Spanish class so that was good. Only thing about that was Mrs. Johnson called the Gringotts Goblins "trolls" and goblins and trolls are like 2 different species and it just kinda ticked me a little.  Another eh thing was my senior ring. I don't really love it all too much but it's nice. It would be even nicer if the damn thing fit my finger. It's too big for all of them, it doesn't even fit on my tumb or anything. But 7th period was deffinitly the highlight of my day. About 15 minutes before the bell rang Mr. T (Teffurie, not like the guy who goes "I pitty the fool" and "Jibba jabba") said that Msr was gonna make an announcement and we all should hear it. So, the big man gets on the PA and says "As you juniors know tomrrow is supposed to be your ring ceremony but we have decided to postpone that till Monday. Now, tomrrow is the feast of St. Joseph, our schools patron saint, and I think it would be nice to have the day off to honor him." and the lunch room went CRAZY... it like EXPLODED. It was great and Rob gave off this feminine scream that made even the gayest man go "That was good." Then, track was just a blast. Debra's whole thing sucks really really bad, and by the way good luck today Deb at the doctors call me with the detials. But, after our workout today there was a huge girls team snowball fight. It was so fun. I hate hearin about teams that all they do is think about running and never have any fun. I mean, I'm a serious runner and when I'm running im focused but after practice its nice to have a group snow ball fight. Then, I went to SAT class and came to the conclusion that I'm not going to college. Then, when I got home I started to pack for Indy which is about.. oh... 10 hours or so away. So, then around... oh I dunno 11ish, I get a call from John and he goes "I can see you." and I'm like, "No you can't." and he tells me to look out my window and, hark, there is Dave's car. So the boys came in for a big and we hung out. You have no idea I felt so loved that they came by to wish me a good trip. Even if they only came cause they were in the area, or cause they had nothing better to do, the fact that they stopped by was like really nice: Rob, John, Stasi, and Dave, you's rock my world.. never change. Well... I'm gonna go get my homework done cause it would be nice to like not have any when I get home cause I'm sure I sure as hell won't want to do it when I get home Sunday. x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x Pray that my flight goes by okay.
