Then he got like all embarrassed and tryed hiding it from me.and he didnt think i heard but he was all sayin how he was gonna put the pics on his wall. then he had 2 go 2 the car 2 get some money and his mom picked up the magazine while he was out there and randomly opened 2 a page and it had this like naked woman and she was like "Look at this!!!" and he came back and she told him bout the pic and said just look at the pic ill show you and he got really embarrassed and was all "show me later!!!" it was all very funny. that story was mainly 4 ashes cuz she knows another 1 that kinda goes along w/ that one........if she remembers haha.Oh yeah the evil rooster was killed 2night by my dad.yay!!!!....it was a good rooster....(when it was still in its egg haha) j/k. well im sure this is all rather uninteresting so later dudes haha                 luvz ya'll, mandy
