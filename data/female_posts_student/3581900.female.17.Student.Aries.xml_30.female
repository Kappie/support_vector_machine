For the life of me, I cannot remember what brought me to this place. In fact, I can't remember anything before I got here.        There's a man at the bar that thinks this place does things to people. Who would believe someone who seems to have no life besides heckling the work force here. Not me, that's for sure.        I've got a good head on my shoulders. I bet my inability to remember things is due to using too many cleaning products in an unventilated room. It'll come back soon.        He sure babbles alot. Talks even more when he's really drunk. No one knows where he came from, or where he's been.        Some say he came with the place. They love trying to trick the naive and the gullible. I just smile and keep working.        I'm no ones friend here. I got a job to do. As long as I get by, I'll be fine.        Yeah, I'll be...fine...
