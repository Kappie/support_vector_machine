By killing the result of ur actions when its youngest, when it doesnt have a voice.  The kid doesnt get a chance to live... and if uve ever seen a video of an abortion being performed...u would see that u can NOT do that, the "embryo" has a face, and its frowning when they suck it out.  Or when they use a needle- the baby avoids it...it has more common since then its mother!  45,953,839 babies have been killed since Roe v. Wade
