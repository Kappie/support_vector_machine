Can you please work on that memo that I left on your desk with the back-up and the dictation...I need it by 9am."    Dyanna: (Nervous) "Um...I didnt see anything on my desk...I'll check again..."   Boss: (Stiffly) Well it's there.  Dyanna: Okay.  Exit Dyanna.  Setting: Dyanna's desk piled high with filing that she's been avoiding for months and can never find anything when asked since most of it hasnt been put away yet.  Enter Dyanna, frantic.  She picks up papers strewn about but cannot find anything to which her boss speaks of.  Slowly she turns and looks at the Basset Hound calendar with the really cute puppy of the day.   APRIL 1 . Realization hits her and she smiles.  Starts dialing the numbers to the kitchen extension.  Boss: Hellllooooo?  Dyanna: Is this some elaborate April Fools joke?  Boss: Maaaaybeeee...(chuckle)  Dyanna hangs up on him, laughs to herself.  THE END
