(secret hero of these poems)  Strange how one such line can make it all okay, even if you're biking out in the rain at 3:40am and nothing seems to be working out the way you hoped it would... and none of that matters because you just spent 4 hours drinking wine and whiskey with your best friend discovering new/old wondrous pieces of music by Thelonious Monk and listening to Cassady raps.  And your roommate's good-luck-hug means so much more than the job you wanted so but didn't get-- (and it's okay to sometimes tell people that you love them) -- makes you think the world's not such a bad place, sometimes :)
