I believe there is something about me insulting anna's typing skills. hahaha. Well it was a lovely two weeks in ocean city with anna's family. I went on Extreme Vilocity (sp?). It was amazing. I don't really feel like typing what it's all about. But it was insane. Maybe later I'll feel the urge to type a detailed description... or not. While I was gone our TV broke (will be in the shop for the next week, or more. Oh well, looks like I'll be reading/being online a lot) and we got DSL. Yay things are loading left and right. It's a real shock to me.
