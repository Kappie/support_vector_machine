((you'll have to excuse al the fucked up typos... this keyboard is a little weird))  so let's see.....  i supose the fist order of bussiness is to announce to the world tbat roseannes NOT the nice lady that i thought she was. she's a complete and total nutjob. i have decided to devote an entire post to the enigma of roseanne, but because i cant type worth a shit on this thing, i'm going to save it for when i get home. ((along with the political rantings of moi))((nope... didn't forget))  today i went to the family reunion/50th wedding aniversary of some people. unlke what i expcted.. there were no heavily stoked uncles or station wagons... just som boring old people and a few kids.  strangely enough, roseanne's family is nothing like roseanne herself... they're actually quite cool. like the one sitting next to me now... her name is magenta and uh... she's nice... kind of awkwar wit her sitting here but, ya know.  her youger brother and sister are cyan and heliotrope. thier mother is a photographer  urlLink ((Her Site)) . the rest of the family is also quie nice, but i'm too lazy to go into detail.  after the ceremony thingy there was a bbq. me and devon and magenta sat around bitched about roseanne. it was a lovely evening.  we're leaving tulsa tomorow. should be home by monday. i've got a LOT to post about then. ok, now i want everyone to leavesix comments or so.
