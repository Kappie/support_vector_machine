I'm not going to make a list, and I'm not going to tell you why the cops came but they did. Not that it was a big deal. We weren't doing anything bad. Amanda and I reigned victorious at foosball. We beat Jim's and Tyler's asses!!! Hell Yes.. Best 2 out of 3 and we won!!! YAY!! haha...I actually talked to a lot of people that I normally dont so I am proud. I dont know I get along with everyone. It's not like I have a reason not to... Well this was a very poor entry but I'm tired... had a long fun day and I am going to work out tomorrow morning!! YAY!! And now I have to go and read my bible... I finished the gospel of Mark and now I am going to read the gospel of John...   nighty night   -gabby
