And that's my English teacher, Mdm Nuraidah!! And she is now replaced the HORRYFYING  HIDEOUS Miss "Gorilla" Chin!! Ah...! I don't know why but there's some kind of laughter potion in her that made the whole class laugh when she introduces herself the first time she came.. It made me laugh until my tears flowed out!!  I also had a new subject!! And it's Home Economics!! My Home E. teacher is Miss Michelle Chua and she's very kind to my group!!  I've gotta get out of the internet soon.. Byez!!
