The end I thought was really disturbing in the wake of all these suicides that happened in one family, the neighbors through a party and the theme was "infixiuation". Some older man, maybe 40's, at the party, stood before a pool and said "Goodbye life" and jumps in the water. Everyone stares at him, and two people help him out. Everyone starts laughing when he says "No you don't understand, I'm a teenager and I have problems."  I was thinking...maybe it does look that stupid to older people. I mean, here we are, not having to pay bills, or think about real jobs, or real money aspects, not living on our own, not having to really see what life is yet. And yet, we want to kill ourselves. I think it's just something in the person's mind...but you can't really seem to describe without listing all the normal aspects of depression. But to you it seems so much more. Well, that's how it was with me at least. When I had to start taking my meds, I thought that I was just this one isolated case and not many people experience. But it's the complete opposite. I read in an article once that 10 million teens take Prozac. That didn't make me feel better like "Well at least I am not a freak."...It made me feel even more alone. Like...so I am not that important really. Big deal, if you feel like shit and that your mind almost feels like one big dark space, a lot of people feel that way too, what makes you so special?....When other people can understand what your going through, it doesn't help. It just makes you feel more worthless  cause your just falling into that now sterotype and every time I think about it that way it feels like I am just falling more and more into it. The more I've fallen, the harder it is to get out.  I don't know...I mean....what is making us all so miserable? To blame it on just your mind doesn't work. It seems people need concrete proof on why you hate your life. Big deal, you don't have friends. You really do but you just want to say that so you get more attention in the end from your real friends. Big deal, you hate your parents. Yes, because they ask you to take out the trash once a week and that is just too tough.  I hate falling into a sterotype. Yes I know I do have friends. I have good friends actually. Yes, I live in a nice house, with financial support, I'm in good health, everyone I love is in good health, I don't live in a third world country. But I still hurt myself and cry all the time. Why is that? What honestly makes me unhappy and think bad thoughts? But does it really matter since 10 million other people do the exact same thing?  I don't know what the point is I am trying to make. The idea that depression is an actual health problem is still strange for me. How can being sad be a phsyical problem with your mind? I mean, saddness is an emotion. Everyone feels emotions. So why do certain emotions stay with certain people at longer times? Why can certain people brush off events that hurt them and move on easier then others? Is it because they are a better person or that they are trying to avoid the truth about themselves by ignoring bad situations?  Aren't we supposed to control emotions? Is that why, someone once told me to just get over it and be god damned happy? Why can't I do that? Why can't those 10 million other people that are just taking Prozac let alone the number of people who are "depressed" do that? Is depression even a real problem? Or is it something that was just put into our minds subconsisly and every couple of people feel the need to act out those symptoms?  But that leads to the question, what is real and what is not real, and that is just something no one can really answer.
