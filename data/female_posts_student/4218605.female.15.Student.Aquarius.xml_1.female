The previous night, I had a nightmare and Scout woke me up .. like clockwork. BUT yester day I took a 2 hour nap. It's no reciprocation, though, as it counts to the 6 hours on the previous night.  ..I don't know how to sleep. ._.;  I recycled today for the first time. I did paper with Tristan. It's actually not so bad. Whenever Tristan recycles, I'll try to recycle. Hopefully I can do it next week and the week after, to count as an ELMO. For whenever I just don't want to do one. And then whenever we recycle, we can get mad extra credit, which is really helpful, especially for this 6 weeks. The High Holy Days (Ira .. you crazy Jew, you know what those are ;]) etc.  -Sigh.- It's hot. I'm tired. Hot  tired = going into air conditioned room and sleeping.  Yep.  Comment if you read this. Ira, Andy, Bob, Shelby, anybody.  PS HOW DO I FIX THIS GODDAMN TIME STAMP?
