I got the awesome-est clothes...It's just hard to believe I got a shirt from American Eagle and an awesome outfit from Aeropostale. WHAT'S THE WORLD COMING TO?! I have a good excuse tho...the AE shirt was all about the rock and I paid 5.25 for it lol. And the Aero outfit was like fate...my mom and I actually agreed on the awesomeness of it. Since that never happens, I had to get it. *sighs* I also got books. Lord of the Flies and The Once and Future King...I hafta read that during the school year. It's about King Arthur n Merlin n all that good stuff, and since I like that shit, I'm kinda lookin forward to it. NOW to read my required summer books...that's a toughy. And my mom rudely reminded me I have less than 2 months to finish them and write the hella long report on them. Thanx mom *salutes*   SOOOO the sirens went off...I was thinkin that I'm only happy when it rains and then when I checked out Tasha's hott blog, that song was there...Our great minds must always be at work or something lol.  Continuing with the summer madness, I'm having a party @ the crib yo. If you are Amber, Tasha, Angie, Nifer, Sarah, Mandy, or Brittany, you are invited. If you wanna come crash it, go ahead. If you think you shoulda been invited, e-mail me or gimme a call, I'll sneak you in. Depending on who you are, you get a wink wink. lol So yeah..Saturday @ 7 to Sunday @ noon. Then you gotta get your ass out and move on with your life. We will have pizza AND ice cream. We can even work on our pyro skills lol...  Dudes...I'm tired...it's still thundering and raining and w/e...I'm gonna go...much luv
