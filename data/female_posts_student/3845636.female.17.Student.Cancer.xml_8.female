We still have our CCAs and pw... arrgh, this is getting on my nerves. I think lately I have been running into some bad luck or something. Lost 3 of my precious things... I lost $15 today. gosh... I spent the whole break frantically searching for it. However, what's gone is gone... I can't do anything now... =(  Yup... on the way home today. Something unexpected happen. Haha... I was nearly squashed in the packed bus that I boarded. GoodNEss... these passengers or rather lazy bums just refuse to be considerate enough to make way for me to alight the bus. Despite my many... and I mean MANY attempts to say "Excuse Me!!!"... the only person which was kind enough was an ITE student who actually helped me to press the "stop" button upon my request. So this comes to my point here... even if one is smart/intelligent... without the right character and positive attitude... that person = redundant. He really needs to do some self reflecton. ITE as some ppl may jokingly say that it stands for "It's The End". Not true... I definitely disagree to it. If you are willing to perservere, regardless of which ever institution you are in... with the great inner beauty... you will surely go far.  On a higher note... as I was walking home I passed by my neighbours house. Then I realised some giglings and some kind of mini 'concert' going on. I saw 4 cute little girls acutally trying to set up a small stage outside their house. Creative enough... they actually used 2 hanger post as barriers. ANd one of these sweetie pies started to sing aloud..." I'm Falling in Love... di da da da..." . haha~ but my sudden apearance caused that girl to blush immediately. I pretended not to take notice of them and continued my journey. Then I heard some giglings behind me... when her friends actually asked her why she stopped singing... she went like "wait a while lah... there's someone...." Upon hearing this... I could not help it but to burst out in laughter. wahaha... these girls really remind me of my childhood days.  I was no different from them. There I wore my big fluffy "keng keng" dress with huge agogo round dangling ear rings... slipped into my mum's high heels... borrowed her lipstick to touch up a little. And there I go... my little mini fashion show. hahaha... okay okay... I know it's pretty lame. But still it was really fun... amusing and 'self entertaining' ... hahhaa =P  Hmn... there's CO tomorrow! haha~ this CCA makes my day most of the time... unless when I'm not in the mood. Not forgetting my CO 'FamiLy'... they are the ones that really brighen up my day. There's this magnetic thing between us that can never pull us apart. Hopefully... we will always remain as united. Hmn... lately did not really have some time for a mini congregation... but I guess some things can be felt. It's felt in the heart and actions can't say it all. Yup...I guess we can understand each other...  Anyway... a super long day tomorrow. Up to 7 plus... goodness me... I think I'm going to fall asleep half way through the rehearsals. Hopefully everything will go on smoothly...  Through this cca... I can see my passion for music growing day by day. Really! I'm proud to be from co. Yesh~ so let's pray that it rains heavily tomorrow too... nice weather to escape from P.E. wahhahaa... that's all then. WIll blog again when I'm free. Really wanna make a chatbox and to load some music onto this blog. Guess I'll try to get it done asap... ciao~
