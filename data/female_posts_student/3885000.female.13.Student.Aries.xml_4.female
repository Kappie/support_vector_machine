Decsions,Descions,Do I want to join air cadets and discontinue the youth events committee?I'll decide eventually.I've always wanted to go party but i havent.I just dont have the chance.on my trip I got myself some shirts and stuffies.I got to play tourist.wheee.A week and a bit I get to be away from the 'rents.Thats gonna be awesome.Im babbling like a long gone fish so im going to stop.
