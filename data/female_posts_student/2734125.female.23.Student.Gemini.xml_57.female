I looked at dioramas and played with space things.  I talked to little kids and made a magical cross out of a dried reed, a piece of the Koran, a lilac blossom and a feather.  I then planted it in the exposed stones of the city park lake, on the east side.  Then we went and talked about altering reality at a coffee shop that was near by.  The coffee boy there was very flirty.  When I went in and asked for more water for my tea he said, "You can have whatever you want love, the world is your oyster."  Really, he said this.  I was baffled not only by that but by the easy light that was filtering into the world, and by the little boy, likely about 4 years old, who was fascinated by his discovery of opening and closing gates, and his own reflection in a small puddle.  We sat outside, even though it was starting to cool down, and we sat in long silences punctuated by comments about the flow of everything.  The tree that loomed above me wore strings of lights with small tin shades, and there was a worn stone lion guarding the door.  It was a strange amount of adventure.  He and I had not spent overly much time alone until then.  I think that it is the sign of true friendship, or at least the movement towards trust and comfort.  We did not push the quiet that was there.  It just sat.  No need to impress, no need to start again faltering.  And when the conversation was there, vibrant or languid or violent, it was the in between that sat remembered.  in between I observed that child, aware of the huge smile on my face as he found toys of hinges and magic gateways of locks.  in beteen I saw there was a condom wrapper that was sliver with blue print floating in the lake where fifty feet away, people were fishing with tangled lines drawn from the water.  Later I dreamed about the people that were hauling this matted line out of the lake, and in my dream there was a demon on the other end.    It was rejuvenating and at the same time still, and this was key to the success of the Sunday museum trip.  We still have to hit the zoo and the DAM soon.  In the mean time we are starting spring all over again, after last weeks angry storms that sat white and freezing wet over everything.  We watch the trees again for flowers that haven't frozen and died, and the earth for what the water should be bringing.  Small deaths, every second, every day.  Whole cycles played out in the afternoon.  The work is starting to weigh on me, all the work that is not on paper and needs to get there sooner then I think I'll be ready.  I know that its grinding me when I catch myself almost being jealous of my friends that just work and don't have homework.  Almost.
