He  had to get a vaccination for it because he's working in foodservice at the race track, and he ending up getting it. Doesn't that suck?  .....He's still going to school and work and everything though, so he's saying that we (all his friends) should get tested for it also.  ...Anyway, don't eat at the track.  David works there and has TB... ...Then you'll get it and die... Well, probably not die since we can treat it and all that stuff, but it could happen...
