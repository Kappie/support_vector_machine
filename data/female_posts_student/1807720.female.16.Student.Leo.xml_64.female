It was such a short day yesterday - it was great.  Chels and I went to go have some pizza for lunch then we walked back to my house cause the overpass is up no and there is no point waiting for a bus.  I showed her my dress for Winters Eve and well then we sat on my bed for three hours talking while we drank hot chocolate.  Then of course she had to work and well I started on my homework and studying and stuff.  Then later we went to TAPS and well I told my TA all about my true opinions.  My mom was kinda annoyed cause she thought my TA was ignoring her.  I am so glad Chels made honors too cause she really does deserve it.  Chels, Sarah, Monet, Lenny, and I all made honors.  Now we call ourselves the "Charmed" ones - Monet, Chels, Sarah, and Myself.  Lol.  We are all like obsessed with the show charmed which reminds me that I think it is on tonight.  I still have to watch the episode of survivor I taped and the finale of Bachellor that I taped.    Today was ok I guess.  Just ok like one of those days.  It is just that math that is really worrying my right now.  I know she is like trying to help me understand the truth is I DON'T UNDERSTAND.  I have no idea how to do half of the stuff and half of my homework I can't even do.  I am really really REALLY worried.  Tommorom is gonna be dedicated to finishing my religion stuff and well maybe finish my CALM stuff in the evening.  Then Sunday I think I will use the entire day to prepare for math and then I just have like two Chem questions to do.  Monday of course is set aside for Travis cause his parents won't be home so we are going to spend some time in his hot tub.  *I Can't wait*  And yeah I do plan to make out in there and I am sure he is just as eager to do the same thing, but I don't want to take it all the way cause I am not gonna be stupied and get pregnant or anything stupid, but yeah just makeout that is all.  No parents - ALONE...yup that is right we will be all alone.  And well yeah I knew my Chem inside out and well on the quiz I started to confuse myself.  I sure hope that I still did good though because I really studied ALOT for that and I KNOW that I DO KNOW the material.  I need to get my Chem mark up and well my Math mark would be nice to raise but for now I think a realistic goal would be just to maintain it right now.  And well yeah Travis bought me lunch afterschool and stuff and well then he went off to work and I left.  All I have been doing today is eating...chocolate, pop, cookies.  Yeah so I guess it isn't a bad thing to reward myself for doing good is it??!?!...lol.  Yeah as long as I don't gain 5 pounds cause yeah of course my image worries me.  I want to look good of couse.  Guys seem to gravitate towards me now that I am 42 pounds lighter.  So yeah I want to go watch Charmed now and I think Boston Public is on tonight but chances are that it is a repeat.
