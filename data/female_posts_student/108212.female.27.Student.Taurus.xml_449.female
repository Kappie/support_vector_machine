I figured if he needed something he'd call but probably not since it was Friday night and he probably went out with his buddies.  I'm thinking of going to San Diego.  Any comments I can get on that.  I mean I don't really have a lot of free time, hell, I probably should just run to Lawrence instead.  I think I'm going to Lawrence next weekend then.  Man, I so need a break.  You know what they brought to my attention yesterday.  Ghaison and Harley said I space out a lot.  I never noticed it before but I do get distracted so easily.  I can't believe I've lost my brain cells.  Can you guys help me find them, please?  Well, like I said not a lot of free time here so I should go.  Maybe do some homework or something.  Everybody wish me luck on getting my brain cells back.
