I have propose a new one, "old people suck (sometimes)"  We have currently over 1,000 guests that are above the age of 55 and I swear some of these people are the crabbiest. I had two people in one of my group functions last night (in addition to non-english speaking japanese people), just pull out the bitchy card with me last night. I talked to the hotel manager and everything is fine now.  My bosses are so layed back. Just very cool. They say, "Bravo, my dear. You are doing great. Do not worry.  Finito."  Their language and culture is very charming, for sure.   Oh, so, for Paddy - On board this ship for this cruise is philadelphia phillies player with last name of THOME. His wife is drop dead gorgeous and apparently they are pretty famous.  Does anyone know who they are? I didn't know until last night when one of my table-mates told me.  Speaking of which, Yiannis (our assistant hotel manager) invited me to dine with the formal captain's table last night and so I sat with all of the people I chose. Just lovely people I picked. Somehow, I managed to pick out one man in the JAG (Attorney for the navy - yes, Richard, I know you are singing the theme song right now - "In the navy, In the navy."), and two other attorneys - one for criminals, another for real estate. I had a therapist for criminals, a marketing specialist and his debutante wife as well as a travel agent woman. It was great.  All of my invites praised me in front of the captains. We had lots of wine and made jokes, had the greatest dinner (new york sirloin! yes, I ate steak and I normally hate it. It was incredible!).  After dinner, I received roses for me and all of the guests.   I am learning new languages. Greek, French,  Spanish.  some many cultures collide here...  It's awesome.  Today, Uma and I are going to Wallmart to get a christmas tree, christmas cd's and stockings. We are putting stocking in our office so people can drop things by to us. Hahaha. It's going to be great having Christmas in Mexico. I miss my family and friends so much. and my Jennifer. But thankfully I have made some wonderful friends and they will keep me company so I don't jump off the ship. Hahaha. Oh forget about it - I would never. This life is too fun to write home about.    Lots of luv, Shelly
