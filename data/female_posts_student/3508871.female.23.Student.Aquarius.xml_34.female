Yes yes, I know some of you who think this documentary maybe biased or is heavily biased but hey Moore proved his point and he did a good job in pushing people's button. As for me, I have already known how corrupted Bush Administration has been. Their MOTTO is "DESTROY DESTROY innocent lives cause there's MORE MONEY FOR US" That's what they have been doing, destroying the lives of not only innocent american lives but also lives of innocent IRAQI's of whom have nothing to do with any of this stupid money making scheme! It is all about DA MONEY!!! What i think? BUSH NEEDS TO GO! And you guys know what to do! VOTE HIM OUTTA HERE....and oh yeah do not forget to watch FARENHEIT 9/11. Everyone needs to have their own opinion and for everyone's sake STOP  BUSH!
