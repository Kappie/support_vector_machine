I would love to be able to take the kids swimming but I just don't know how I would feel trying to chase them all around. I felt the same way yesterday when I was out and about shopping but it seems to come and go. I took some meds, have tried to lay down but just can't fall asleep. Mikayla is bugging me to go over to Alex's and go swimming agh! I just feel like crap right now.      Well I am in a chat room right now so I will be back in a few to write some more cause I wanna write about shopping and what not yesterday. I hope I am feeling better for tonight cause we are having a party!!!
