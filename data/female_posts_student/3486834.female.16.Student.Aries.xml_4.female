YAY! he is the biggest perverted fag teacher i know. sorry if that didn't make sense.  well anyways, so far summer has been very interesting.  hung out with jennifer.. went to a party, went to paxton's house a couple of times. when we were walking back to my house, he attacked me with water balloons, it wasn't too cool! oh and i cuddled with dylan ;) he is really hot! but i think one of my friends likes him. oh well!  today i got my report card, I DID GOOD! but it's gay cause i didn't even make honor role when i had A's in everything. i guess i am smarter then i thought!  lol.. not really. uhh what else..  i saw mean girls. it was good, but there were no hot guys there(at the movies) :( then when i got home paxton was being an ass! he got all pissed at me for no reason, and then we just argued forever. so i guess i am mad at him,.. most of it is blamed on me PMSing.. you didn't need to know that, but i might as well warn you! lol.. cause i am dangerous right now! oh and about my report card, i made an A on my exam in spanish!! go me!! i am not to good in that class.. they call me 'white' or something *shrugs shoulders* it's not like they are lying or anything!
