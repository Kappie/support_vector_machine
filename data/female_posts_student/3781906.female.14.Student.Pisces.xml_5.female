I have better things to do, but it doesn't matter to her.   It's hot in here...   *Gets up and opens a window*   That's better...Sleeping on the problem involving "Bobby" did no good. It just gave me a killer migrain. I was thinking far too much. I have noticed that I'm getting them more... Not a good thing. I just need to shut my mind off for a while.   Turn off your mind... Relax, and float down stream... It is not dieing... It is not dieing...  Thing is, I missed church last night because I was sick. It's strange. I don't feel my usually guilt for skipping Church last night. I'm even a little releaved. THAT, my friend, is a very long story.   Let's just put it this way: I know I will be rubuked, and I don't deal with it well. Half the time I burst into tears, the other half I get bloody furious and start swearing my head off. I don't want either. I just want to be left alone.   But I know that's not the way things work.   Ambsy
