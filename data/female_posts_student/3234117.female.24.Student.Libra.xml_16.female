Maybe this happens more so with girls and less with guys, I don't really know.  When something is bothering me I'll keep ruminating over it, rehashing it, think about different scenarios, basically analyzing it to death.  Why?  What's the point, right? If I know by doing something I will feel sad or mad, why would I keep doing that thing, keep subjecting myself to that?  It's the same thought process of pinching yourself, thinking that hurts, and then pinching yourself again to see if the same feeling of pain will recur or if you will have different levels of severity.  Go for a drink and test this question out.  You know drinking in excess will hurt you, make you sick, but still you keep drinking and changing your intake to see how much or how little it'll hurt you.    I relate more so to listening to my friend's stories or thinking about my own personal experiences, than to drinking.  So many times I will hear from a friend, "why did I do that? I knew it would hurt me or make me sad."  We know our actions will sometimes hurt us, maybe from past experiences or maybe from our intuitions, but yet we still go down that path, time after time again.  Why can't we just realize that for the most part, in similiar situations, the results will be the same?  I read a quote somewhere that said something like insanity is taking the same actions and expecting different results.
