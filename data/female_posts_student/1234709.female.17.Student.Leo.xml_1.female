I woke up late again which was great and then i saw justin soon after that. we got slurpees! yummy. then he went to work. hmm  that was interesting  then i went to costco with my mommy, that was even funner! she made me cary the stuff all by myself. we argued about it the whole time we were there and half way up to erins. I decided that she was mean and that when she was old and craggedy that I was going to get her back for it. yes i will.....  well then i was wonderfully greated at the door by my beautiful wifey. and then..we went upstairs and there was paige. that was a super surprise. and then....i have alot of and thens. doesnt that get annoying? if so just let me know! (Erins eating tissue...btu we wont get into that.) so we went off to the beach when Azzy came to pic us up. wow its great to have so many great new friends. we went downtown and walked along the board walk all the way to city park and well, didnt really have anywhere to go from there. so there was a lot of sitting. we got bored of that and so we went back to erins. well just me and erin  but soon after e got bored and went back to Azzys. she has a fucking HUGE house!!! I was jealouse. very very jealouse. shes even got the huge pool in the back yard. grr. i want. then steve and tyson came over. ayh niki i was hanging with tyson. haha, hes fun to look at. kinda cute in a odd sorta way. hes a fun guy...surprisingly lazy! I say that we kiked the guys ass at pool. I was acctually the good player. i was so proud..and then when i made what would have been the winning shot, what did they do, say no it doesnt count cause i didnt call it. I was like :P to fucking bad. cause i won. then we went on a long walk  to a prak, swoung on swings and played grounders. Ran there sprinklers and walked back to azzys where we hung out in the drive way. that was cool. we are hot. oh no erins got tissue again. then home. then this now sleep goodnight.
