It was fun! But, even though i'm older than them, freshman girls can be intimidating... i felt weird just going up and introducing myself and having them laugh at me. I started off the day rough by being late to our leadership meeting, but mason didn't seem to notice or care... can't say i didn't mind that. Supposedly i'm supposed to get 3 hours of detention.. but oh well. Collin was like 15 minutes late... sometimes i wish i didn't care like him. Then i had to teach people outside. Sometimes i feel like my squad leaders think i'm either really stupid or just retarded cuz they seem to coach me and tell me what to do a lot. I'm really not stupid... it may seem like it sometimes, but its just cuz its kinda funny sometimes, i don't really think i am. I just wanna be like hey, i have a brain as well... yay!.. lets see... then playing...  that girl who's supposed to be really amazing was good, but not as good as others were saying.. thats a relief. I came home and watched some tv... then went to see harry potter. that was fun... but i dunno if i either missed some things by not seeing the second movie or i just didn't like it as much... who knows... we found things funny that weren't really supposed to be funny... but who cares.   there's this bird that sits on my window sill every morning and all day long. Sometimes i'm ok w/ its constant chirping, but lately its just bothering me cuz he just keeps chirping and won't stop. I mean, you'd think it'd have something to do all day besides make noise.. oh well. Its funny that i'm not so tired anymore after i've started writing this.  I guess this is enough for you guys to read for now. BTW- thanks for the comments guys, it makes me feel special!   adios-  Lisa  Song for right now: "Brand New Colony"- The Postal Service (i dunno why, i think it was the last song i heard before i got outta my car so its stuck in my head)
