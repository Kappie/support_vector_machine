The culprit? Seven-year old Nicky, aka Chimp Ashton, who unlike most human males, has hit puberty a bit early. Poor Maya shouldn't count on too much help from dad, though, because it appears that eight other female chimps at the zoo are awaiting their own bundles of joy.   So Nicky is a bit of a runaround, maybe more  urlLink Marc Anthony  than Ashton, but those  urlLink chimp babies  sure are cute.  Read more  urlLink here .
