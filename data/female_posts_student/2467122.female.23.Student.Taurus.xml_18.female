It seems like a person can be here one minute and then gone the next- you never know when or where will be the last time you see them.  It could be at an all you can eat sushi restaurant where you share what you both have been up to for the past few years since high school.  It could be walking through the west village looking for a place that sells nose piercing retainers.  It could be in the Astor Place K-Mart looking for a cheap Rangers t-shirt.    The last time I saw Oscar was as he stepped off the W onto the Times Square platform to go home.  He gave me snacks to take for the long bus ride back to Boston.  He gave me inspiration in his courage.  He brought a smile to my face every time I  talked to him.  Now he is gone.    He's not hurting anymore.    RIP Oscar Orlando Acosta, Jr.  You are missed more than you know.
