This  urlLink article  looks at how Iraq compares to Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" and the Congolese ivory and rubber boom. Another good book if you're interested in more of this is  urlLink "King Leopold's Ghost"  by Adam Hochschild. This tells the history behind much of Conrad's novel, and discusses the actual horrors and extermination of the era. Again, frighteningly relevant.
