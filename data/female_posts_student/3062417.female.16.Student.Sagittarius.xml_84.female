Carol, Kim, Danielle, Kevin, Ned, and Kayla are in the paper ring gang. That's cause we are awesome! And AP is over so I basically get a SH in there every day too. It's the greatest. I got my sheet back from solo fest today. I got a 15 out of 15 for accuracy and a 10 out of 10 for tone!  My thoughts of the day are: Oompa loompas are scarier in Spanish. Ned and Kevin are the best newspaper picture defilers that I know! And last but not least, I love summer time.  Song I've had stuck in my head all day: [Get Out(Leave) by JoJo]  So in a little bit I'm riding my bike down to Wards with Carol and then going to swim in Josh's pool. It's going to be so much funness.
