Knowing that your God Brother is really sick is not a good thing, especailly when your god brother is really good. right now, that is what i am going through. In 2 weeks time, i am going to go back to the place where i Dont belong ...SYDNEY. yes, sydney is a great place and everything, but its just not a place for me, especially when right now you are in the place where you belong. Me?? i reckon i belong in Hong Kong, i grew up there (in Hk) so why do i not belong there? Staying in Hong Kong would be the one and only thing i would wish for, nut my one and only wish would never come true...unnless i staring making it true....  Jenny
