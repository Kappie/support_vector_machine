I hope it makes you think, if it doesnt, then there is no hope for yous. Lets get started.        --------------------    Word of the Day 7.25.04          beau ideal \boh-ay-DEEL\, noun;      plural beau ideals:A perfect or an idealized type or model.

Doctors:   (A) The number of physicians in the U.S.is 700,000.   (B) Accidental deaths caused by Physicians per year are 120,000.   (C) Accidental deaths per physician is 0.171.    Statistics courtesy of the U.S. Dept of Health Human Services and   is a conservative number.   Now think about this:        Guns:   (A) The number of gun owners in the U.S.is 80,000,000. Yes, that's   80 million.   (B) The number of accidental gun deaths per year, all age groups,   is 1,500.   (C) The number of accidental deaths per gun owner is 0.0000188.   Statistically, doctors are approximately 9,000 times more dangerous   than gun owners.   Remember, "Guns don't kill people, doctors do."    FACT:       NOT EVERYONE HAS A GUN, BUT ALMOST EVERYONE HAS ATLEASTONEDOCTOR.   Please alert your friends to this alarming threat. We must  bandoctors before this gets completely out of hand!!!!!   Out of concern for the public at large, I have withheld the  statistics on lawyers for fear the shock would cause people to panic  and seek medical attention.         -------------------------------     Sports Report     God damn phillies.
