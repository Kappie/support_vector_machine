I tried to post something here yesterday night but this web's like down or something... Hope this does not happen everytime! Okay then.. Let's start with what has been happening around recently...  Just 2 days before, on Tuesday, my sis had an operation something bout her spine not being straight and she was at SGH... Went to see her in the evening til nighttime n she was kinda drowsy n VERY thirsty! I always wonder why the people having operation can neither eat nor drink for the 24 hours period before an operation. Sai Lam experienced this before, I heard. After which, I had to take the long MRT ride from Outram to Pasir Ris and a bus back home. What a tiring day!  Yesterday, I had physics lesson n managed to stay focused! Well.. Or at least most of the time.. =p  After which, i went home instead of playing basketball cuz of the downpour! Well anyway, watched Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban! It was really nice and cool! Too bad that the original actor for Prof. Dumbledore passed away last year i heard. Now tat new actor looks kinda weird in that costume(it looks more like a pyjamas instead of a wizard's robe to me actually.. =p). Everyone's great in tat show man!  Expecto Patronum!!!  Whoo~ So cool! And i loved tat twist in de story! Tot Sirius Black was a bad guy at first.. Hee... Though i had the books, i didn't read it. Lazy i tink. *am i talking too much bout harry potter?* Went home n was very tired! No dinner somemore so have to take some instant noodles again. Sms-ed Tabby for quite a while. Heard tat she had a new nokia phone! Good for her. She'll be leaving today... Sobsob...   Now, today, woke up early n started writing this blog! Lucky today's physics lesson was cancelled. Phew! Still hav maths though. Tabby's leaving this morning at 7am! Hope she'll be all right n enjoy herself there! All the best to her! Now hav to start preparing to go to school.. Heaven eaten... Moreover tonite at 8pm Jason, Kheng Wei and me are going to help out at the Church for Mr Kelvin Lau's wedding... OuCh! >_   Updates at 10.40pm!  Jus got home not long ago! Morning went to play a bit of basketball and was kinda late for maths lesson! Never tio scolded though... He was teaching on Probability and was lame in a way bout dice, coins, poker n so on. He even asked us to bring poker n dice to school tml! After which, i ate n went home before going out again to watch The Be$t Bet which was mostly in  hokkien  and it wasnt a very good show. =(  However, because the air-con in the cinema was kinda like not working, Mu Hua, mainly, talked to the manager n we managed to get complimentory tix! For de seven of us(Sabrina, Yi Teng, Vincent, Mu Hua, Kheng Wei, Jason and me) though... The tix can watch almost any movie shows! After tat, Vincent brought the guys to Bedok n met Mr Chia. Had dinner there n went to the church n we're late! Mr Lau himself was not there.. GeeZ! Our jobs' to move stuff around(mostly musical instruments on the stage) n we were playing with drums, piano.. etc. I took a few photos of the church n ourselves. I'll post em on my   urlLink webshots   asap. After helping out, it was bout 9.30pm n we went to bedok interchange n had drinks together. Jason n I had some kinda soap-added lemon drink~ YuCk! Took bus 17 from there back home! Gotta sleep soon! ZzZzz...
