Many of the conspiracy theories are already floating around out there on the Internet, but Moore has a way of telling the story in a humourous, horrifying, sorrowful and intriguing way.  I cannot recommend it highly enough; I'm also awfully proud of  urlLink Jean Chretien  for his lack of contribution in Iraq.    Spoke to M.D. tonight.  Embarrassed him in front of his cronies by asking him politely but with a touch of disappointment in my voice why he hadn't returned my important phone call in over three weeks.  He said he hadn't had time to consider my proposal (of March 13, 2004) yet and didn't know what to say.  I informed him (less than gently) that the proposal didn't matter; I had been accepted to theology in Hogtown on a full-time basis in September, and that's why I wanted to speak to him.  The others looked at him and he said sadly, "I didn't get your message."  Total lie.  He and the others congratulated me profusely.    More to come...
