Restricted to bare necessities: an abstemious way of life.  Notice how all the vowels are in order? Maybe you didn't.But I did. Anyways, about an hour after seeing this, the same thing comes up on an anagram site! "Look, all the vowels are in order!"  lol, Considering this is like my one point of interest for the day... yeah.
