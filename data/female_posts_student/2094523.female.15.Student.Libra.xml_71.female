Coz when we were yougn we really didnt care bout images, we didnt have to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars buying clothes that are in fashion, we cudnt drive so we didnt think bout wanting cars, we didnt care bout having out own tv or own computer..coz when we were little all we wanted was candy and itd make our day. That i tell u, is what makes us different rite now from when we were kids way back when. I mean guys had cooties how much easier did that make it? ALOT.   Stupid people are the ones that fuck up their own lives and the ones thats appear to get the good out of this world when in reality theyre receiving none. why? its coz theyre too stupid to realize others around them, theyre too stupid to care, theyre to stupid to think of anythun else but them selves. and once they get burned in this world, they cant blame it on others because they know very well the reason they got burnt is coza themselves and their stupid actions. And u know what? stupid people damn well deserve to get their lives fucked..but then again all of us humans are stupid stupid creatures
