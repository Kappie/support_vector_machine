And maybe that illusion that I have a secret from you is mysterious. When you suddenly realize that they have this other side, cloud, face, whatever, you look at them in a new light. And maybe that's why they never told you that before. Maybe they didn't want you to sympathize with them. Or pity. Or completly disregard them and destroy them, and yourself. This startling discovery that I have made, that everyone has another face, is something I have yet to decide my opinion on. And until I figure out where I stand in this massive world, I'm going to keep treating people the way I have. Loving, kind and respectful - because that's what I want them to treat me.  A few months back I broke up with my boyfriend. We were like, best friends before (Yeah, stupid, I know) and things just progressed higher. But lately I had felt that we were more friends, and things were getting awkward. So we ended it, promising to still be friends. I've never missed him more. I wrote him a bunch of poems that he loved, and said he would keep forever. He gave them back to me. A few of his friends, and his sister (who is my friend as well) were telling me that he didnt want to see me anymore, have anything to do with me in his life. That hurt. To have lost one of my oldest, best male friends like that really hurt. Yesterday, I was following around one of my other friends, and we had to talk to him. And there was an awkwardness between him and me. I think all three of us felt it. I regretted it. I summed up all the courage I had to today and went up to talk to him. I asked him, straight out whether what he had said was true. He denied it. I've known him to lie before, but hearing that from him opened a whole new door of respect and love that I had for him before, as my friend. I went back to his class, to see one of my friends, and he came over to talk with us. He never would have done that if I hadn't of confronted him and asked him that. I'm so proud of myself, I think I'm almost starting to grow up.  With that said, I reply: What?! I don't wanna grow up! I want to be 6...I mean, 16 forever! :P I'm glad though, that I'm starting to "open up to the world and its problems". Biiiiig Woman.
