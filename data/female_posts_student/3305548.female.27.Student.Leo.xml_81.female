I blast the horn as the other car zooms by. It's stupid and dangerous and illegal to use the left turn lane for passing - and very impatient. I honked more as a warning to other cars up the line that something was out of the ordinary and to take a look around. Not to just be obnoxious. Well the passenger in the passing car made a vague attempt at flipping me off - he got halfway there. Now, I was not offended by the motion but rather by the context...I mean hello?!?!?! If your the one pulling stupid driver tricks you have to expect others are not going to appreciate it and may give you some feedback. Flipping off people for pointing out that what you are doing is illegal and dangerous is not rebellious, the bird then simply becomes a sign of ignorance.   Once we got to the stoplight to turn left to get to the pharmacy, I looked over at the car to my right - and guess who it was??? The person who was in such a hurry they risked the safety of several vehicles to pass go no further ahead than myself. Doubt that will teach them a lesson, but it makes me wonder - why do people like that exist if not to prove Sarte right? Hell just might be other people.   The week in an empty house is going lovely so far. I can stay up until when I like and get up as late as I like and vary my schedule day to day as to when I sleep or wake without hearing, "you need to get on a schedule" or just getting the evil eye. We can have dinner (or not have dinner) whenever we want to...and not precisely at 4:45 every day. I can walk around the house in my PJs, or in whatever I want really, and perhaps most importantly - our cat has free reign! The basement kitty gets to roam the house and exercise his free will for a change. It makes him so much easier to live with.   We have rented several movies, most of which I will comment on at least a little....not all of them are worth a full out review. One of those unworthy is Cody Banks 2. See if you wanna play a cinematicquiz game of all the familiar looking adult actors, or just for the moment toward the end when one of the other kids (who plays a musician whose charactercomes from some kind of Eastern Bloc nation) breaks into James Brown. It made me roll over laughing and my husband even lost it (he was working very hard at looking like he was NOT enjoying the movie under any circumstance.) If you have to see Cody Banks 2 then this moment at the end makes it all worthwhile.   My husband has been playing hours of Front Mission Four. (A video gamefeaturing giant robots that are piloted by characters and loaded to the gills with weapons...Plus, it actually has an interesting plot line to boot.)He loves it! Oh, did I mention we finally got a PS2? My hubby has been very patient in his wait for one of these new generation video game consoles. We decided the hours of entertainment it would provide was worth the money. Besides, he was going to get one for his birthday...now he just got it earlier. That will be the last and only big purchase however. Back to the budget again...   In the "real news":   Arnold Schwarzenneger gets called out for calling Democrat Congressmen "girlie men" forholding upthe budget in CA, and one of the Republican Congressmenresponded that reviving the SNL weight lifter skit line was not a good idea - after all liberals dont have a sense of humor. HA! I think the statement that liberals have no sense of humor is funny. But I think in this case context is everything. Perhaps if Arnie had said "As they say on SNL...blah blah blah" it would have gone over better. The gay community is taking affront to the language, and so are the liberals with no sense of humor.   Bonus:Arnold and my mother share a birthday - though I am not sure of the year. And did you know Arnold's dad was a Nazi Stormtrooper? I didnt know that. News to me.   This just in:    urlLink http://entertainment.excite.com/article/id/415918entertainment07-19-2004::19:06reuters.html     LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - 'Singer Linda Ronstadt was thrown out of the Aladdin casino in Las Vegas on the weekend after dedicating a song to liberal film maker Michael Moore and his movie "Fahrenheit 9/11," a casino spokeswoman said on Monday.  Ronstadt, who had been hired for a one-show engagement Saturday night at the Las Vegas Strip casino, dedicated a performance of "Desperado" to Moore and his controversial documentary, which criticizes President Bush and the U.S.-led war in Iraq.'   Wow, freedom of speech has a short leash, does it not? I hope Michael Moore was there to catch the whole thing on his camera. I can't believe people rioted over a song dedication but odds are these self same people are unlikely to have voted in the last presidential election. Even if they did, and if they did they obviously voted for Bush, why waste their energy on a flailing, has-been, 80's icon? Then again the publicity from all of this could make Linda's career come back to life.   But what I still dont get is why would it upset a crowd so much that she dedicated a song to Michael Moore? I mean its not like she dedicated a song to a serial killer or pedophile. Gimme a break! The Alladin will never get my business in Vegas - not that I have ever really been to Vegas...and its not on my top ten list but still..... I am sure that the attendees of the concert felt that Free Speech is all well and good until they paid to hear it. But the word free in the phrase Free Speech has nothing to do with funding. Someone should tell the conservatives that.   But it does seem thatRonstadtmay have pushed the buttons of the audienceintentionally...the rest of the Reuters story goes like this:   'Before her concert, Ronstadt had laughingly told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that she hoped that the casino performance would be her last.  "I keep hoping that if I'm annoying enough to them, they won't hire me back," she was quoted as telling the newspaper.  A statement issued by the Aladdin said Ronstadt had been "escorted out of the hotel" just after her performance and said the performer would "not be welcomed back."  "Ms. Ronstadt was hired to entertain the guests of the Aladdin, not to espouse political views," the casino said.'   Now that adds a twist doesnt it?   It is interesting that the Freedom of Speech guidelines seem to be equally appled to the Freedom Not to Hear. I am not sure what I would have done if a person I was paying used my space to espouse beliefs that were not held by me. I suppose it boils down to the time and place issue. But in the end, it'skind ofsad to think that her gesture was motivated to intentionally irritate people that I am sure felt they "paid good money" to see the washed up woman.   Personally, I think the site of a bunch of senior citizens rioting would have been pure entertainment at its best. Apparently conservatives ripping up posters and hasslingthe box office with their walkers and canes was too much entertainment for theAlladin to handle.  Well, thats all the news in fits of print. More or less.   --Mack
