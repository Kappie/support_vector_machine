I stayed at school until 5 doing some art courseowrk. But while the teach was working on it for me I cleaned up her side and now it is all nice and neat. Fantabalo. However I did learn today that the RE and German speaking exam clash. So according to Westy those who miss speaking appointments during the exam get to be put in isolation until we have done it so no one can tell us what is in it. Brilliant. I've never been in isolation before.
