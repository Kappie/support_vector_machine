I think that a class as boring as chemistry should be devoted to talking about that.  I have found two things to be true about the sexes: 1). Girls love to talk about sex, and 2). Guys like to sing.  I wonder why more guys aren't in chorus? You know, I'm a very sheltered child.  It's sad that two sophomores had to inform me what riding the train is, and what a boner is.   Aah.  I feel good.  I knew that I would.  I feel nice.  Like sugar and spice.  Ok, enough with the song lyrics!  Back to introducing a word into the English language (see last entry).  I would like to see foamin as the new WORD (the expression).  I personally like Dumas as a substitute for... well, you know.   My face feels really oily.  I wonder why adolescents get oil.  Really, shouldn't we get something productive, like money sprouting from our oversized pores?  We have to pay for makeup, shampoo/conditioner, face wash, some clothes, car stuff (insurance, payments, gas), AND lots of other stuff, like movies.  I have the best idea for a birthday party.  We go to the restaurant Pizza Hut (or Cici's for the more economical option), then go see a movie.  I know!  It can be called dinner and a movie!  Oh wait, that's already taken.  Darnit. Why do people laugh differently?  It just occured to me cause Young was laughin about something, and I was thinking about how it sounds so different from mine.  And why do we have different voice pitches.  Oh great now I'm thinking about that stupid credit card commercial where everyone looks the same.  Those are some UGLY girls that are like that guy.  My favorite commercial is that Geico one where they're all talkin about how great they feel with their hair growing back, and the physician comes on and says something about baldness being bad.  Then, "But I do have some good news." Announcer: "The John Parker solution to hair loss?"  Parker: "No.  I just saved a bunch of money by switching to Geico." HAHA!!  I like the name Parker.  Lennox is cool (trivia question of the day: Where did I get Lennox from?  See the end for the answer. Oh crap.  I just remembered that Boswell's study session is going on right now.  Hope I'll be ok...I went to the one yesterday.  We're having a Macbeth test tomorrow.  (that would the the answer to the trivia question.)  I don't understand it when I read it alone, but when she explains it, it makes sense.  You know what I want to hear right now?  Britney Spears, Toxic.  I'm no Ms Brit fan, but I do love that song.  There's just something about it that makes it irresistible. Keeping with the irresistible theme, those little packing peanuts.  Right now I'm trying to blot my face with them.  They're actually quite effective.  Also, they're fun to step on.  I hate peanuts.  I stopped eating Snickers because of it...I'm more of a Caramello, Milky Way and Twix kind of person.  I love caramel.  Can you tell.  HAHA! That rhymes with caramel!  One would think I'm high while writing this.  It's sad...I'm not.  Actually, I've never gotten high in my entire life, or gotten drunk.  Still an unpolluted virgin with a healthy liver.  *sigh* Well, my ride is almost here (I'm still at school).  G2G.  Later.    You are Lucy!    urlLink   Which Peanuts Character are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
