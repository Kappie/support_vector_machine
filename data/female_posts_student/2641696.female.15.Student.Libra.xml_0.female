It won't stop tearing, and it's like completely red. But I don't think it's pink-eye, because it's not itchy or anything; just painful. So I won't be wearing contacts for a while, and if this lasts until Monday I'll have to wear glasses :'( Nooo!   I saw the animated Sinbad last night, while my parents were out at dinner or something. Loved it! Animation has seriously gotten so advanced since Bambi, it's insane. Sure, the characters looked like Bugs Bunny and all, but the scenery was incredible; I especially loved the ocean. I also think Sinbad is cute, so that helps, too. I thought they could have done a better job with the script; Marina fell in love with Sinbad after what, 2 days? I don't think so. Especially when she's engaged with the guy's best friend. It reminded me of the Road to El Dorado, and I  love  that movie! N insists that I've never seen the actual end to it, but I think I have. I also remember having a crush on one of the guys. I forget which. Is there a blonde one? Because I think he was blonde...   And there ^^^ is actual proof that I'm a loser :D Who gets crushes on animations??   But to be honest, the Road to El Dorado was really cute.  Much  better than the Emperor's New Groove, which I hated and thought was stupid and etc etc etc.   Ever noticed how, in all animated movies, there's the smart clever one and the stupid sweet one? Or just the quick and the slow one? It's insane; they're all basically the same. I think I watch too many animated films. Wait, no, I take that back: there is  no such thing  as too many animated films! I love 'em! Long live Disney and all those other great animator people!   What else is new... oh, I might not be watching Donnie Darko tonight after all *cries* Simply because I'm too lazy to make my mum drive me out to Blockbuster, but whatever, it's still sad. I really wanted to see it. Haha, I had recommended it to B because I had read a review of it, and it sounded really good, but I hadn't actually seen it yet. And then she saw it, and was like, thank you! But I still hadn't seen it, so then I was like thank  you  for reminding me that this movie still existed! And then R said it was good too, so now I've got two people who think it's awesome. And I'm still too lazy to drive out to Blockbuster. hehehe. I'm going to be a bum when I grow up.   Speaking of bums, mine is sore from sitting in front of this computer for so long. Unfortunately, I can't think of anything else to do. Nothing's on T.V. until at least 4:00, soo..   So anyways, I have no more to say. Au revoir, a bientot, and pray to whoever you want that I'm not sick by Monday. lol.
