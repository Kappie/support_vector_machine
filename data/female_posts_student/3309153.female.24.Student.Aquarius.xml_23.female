I have my entire CD collection to fuel whatever juices one needs when they write papers. It isn't even a serious assignment. The last paper I turned in--last week, mind you--was 45 pages. 45 blasted pages! Of my life...my thoughts...my analyses...my proof...my conjecture...my graphics...my charts...my SOUL. And now I'm tired.  So, I absolutely CANNOT...  be bothered...  to write this 5 page paper--at this moment. My mind is ten other places.   With my love, off in a faraway land. Inside my wallet, wondering if there are quarters for a Coke from the machine. At the cinema, where I would like to go sequester myself. With my friend...is the damage I've done unmendable this time? In his office, down on my knees, worshipping him the only way I'm worthy. In front of the TV, held captive by the Syndication Monster. At the bookstore, where there is a magazine article I am dying to read, but won't until this paper is complete. Inside my wallet, wondering if there are pennies enough for a Cherry Coke from the machine. In Gambier (just for today, and then not again until August), my body pulsing for one last squeeze from Sheldon. Under the covers, where lots of different types of fantastic things could transpire.  But I am here.  In a lab. Not even at my own desk, in my apartment, utilizing my shiny new computer. Rather, in a lab. Like a rat. One who's told, "Go, go, go...produce, produce, produce...provoke, provoke, provoke..."  And she does, usually. But not this moment. Not quite yet...though, I will again...soon.  I'm tired. Really, as tired as I've ever been.  And afraid. Afraid of packing up my whole life and moving back into my parent's home. Afraid of no longer having privacy. Afraid that once I go back in, I'll never emerge. Afraid that someone I know will discover this space. This space I've chosen to air all my thoughts, my secrets, my desires. My blog.  What a strange word. At first, a little off-putting...sounds so much like something people I would never want to talk to spend their entire lives creating. But, now, so will I...because...I need to take a deep breath. So, I've given birth to you. Go forth, my darling. Bring me new acquaintances, laughs, total candor--baptise me into the world of strangers being let into my head, me into theirs.  For ever and ever...Amen.
