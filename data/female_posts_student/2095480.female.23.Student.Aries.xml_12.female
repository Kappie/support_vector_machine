Moving 15 risers up flights of stairs, 65 chairs, 70 stands, multiple stand lights, tympani, instruments, podiums, and all sorts of other stuff is not really what I consider fun. However, I am proud of the stage crew for their work. I was impressed that we actually got everything moved and set-up without damaging anything. I say this because of the shear weight of it all. I have several bruises, but my right hand hurts like hell. The thing that does piss me off regarding VSO is how I am expected to work from 9am to 9pm straight. Granted, I don't perform, but the stage crew performers were given a break whereas I was not - and that was the hardest work of the day - mainly setting up little bullshit items such as stand lights (I know they are important, but its tedious work that receives only a rare thank you) and main stage lights. The latter would not be such a big friggin deal if I did not have to run back and forth between stage and booth. I lost count of how many times I did that. Another thing that I resent is how I am the person that everyone goes to to complain. No one goes to Harding - b/c of the stereotypical he is the scary boss thing; no one goes to Plondke b/c he is too stressed to deal w/ complaints; no one goes to Topper that I know of b/c they want to be rehired. Therefore, they come to me, and I'm fucking sick of that right now. I must say that I got quite a charge out of the fact that Plondke did forget his score today - a problem that had the potential to make the day miserable. However, it was quickly fixed, and the show of course did go on. The day, for me, was miserable. Joe, Robert, and Dr. Collins made it much more bearable for me, yet I would chose to not ever go through with that again. Basically said, I caught alot of crap today.   "Just to let you know, she's a huggy person."  That is how my friend  Rick  described me today. I know I am, however, one thing I must say in defense in that is I only hug people that I really care about. I can't really help it. I don't know why I do this... but I think it has stuff to do with how I grew up and particularly my early year(s) at college. Used to be I never ever gave a hug. I could count on one hand all those not related to me that I hugged in my life. I never mean to offend anyone with a hug, but know that when I offer it I am offering everything that I am to a friend...  That's it for tonight.
