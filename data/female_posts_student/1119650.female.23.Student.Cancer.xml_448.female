How many other lame crappy baseball songs can you make?  I bet you're the same 'tard who wrote "Who let the mets out?"  My question is: who let you out?  You're probably some drooly mongoloid who's mother told him he was funny when he was little.  Guess what?  Just like Santa and the EasterBunny, this too is a lie.  Write better songs.  You're poop.  I hope I never hear that song again.  Good day, Sir! Gwen
