In such times,  I see you laughing  whenever I close my eyes.   Until the day I reach eternal sleep,  that smiling face will  have to stay with me without fail.   People are all sad, so  they go and forget, but--   For that which I should love,  For that which gives me love, I will do what I can.   Back then, when we met,  it was all awkward.  We went the long way, didn't we?  We got hurt, didn't we?   Until the day I reach eternal sleep,  that smiling face will  have to stay with me without fail.   Back then, when we met,  it was all awkward.  We went the long way, didn't we?  We got there in the end.
