There's too much happening at home. So much drama, damn communication.  I hate the way I act around people. Especially family. I still can't let them in, to really know me. I don't trust them. I couldnt change it if I wanted to tho. It's like embeded into my brian. WARNING! These are the people who 'have your back' dont let them in on anything. I hate feeling like a damn robot.  I regret acting like that. Once again, I hate the weekends. Thank you.
