Atleast he told me how to lay brick. :)   Today I have to go to the mall. I don't wanna...we have to find glasses for my dad. Yuck.  Then I have to go to Matt and Hannahs voice lessons because I QUIT! MWa ahahhaa. I am such a quitter. The only musical thing I do now is guitar and I am not doing very good at it becasue I never practice. ˚¿˚   (I like that face. hahha)  Then I go to church. Which should be ok.  I am sleepy. I got way to much sleep and still I am tired! Gr!  I better go brush my teeth! BYE!  Laura Fantora
