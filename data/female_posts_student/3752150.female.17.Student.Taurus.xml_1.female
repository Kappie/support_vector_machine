In case you don't know me here's some background: I'm 17, I have curly blonde hair, and I'm a christian.  Well I guess that's enough background for now, so I'll start my actual post.  I just got back from being a counselor at Bible Memory Camp.  It was so awesome.  BethAnne and I had eight 4th grade girls.  At first I wasn't so sure how well it was gonna work, but it turned out awesome.  By the end of the week, everyone seemed so close to God.  Almost everyone made new commitments.  I became so close to the other campers and counselors that it was really hard to say goodbye.  I think I hugged the other girl counselors like 80 times each.  So much happened it's hard to write it all.  One thing that was cool was how 4 of the girl counselors dressed for banquet night.  Three of us have curly hair and BethAnne has really long hair so we decided to from our hair and wear mismatched clothes.  Let's just say we were definitely the center of attention.  We looked soo awesome.  I'm gonna miss them a lot.  At least I'll get to see most of them when I go to high school camp.  We're gonna try to meet at Holly's house the Saturday before it so that we can hang out before camp.  It was really great, but I am glad to be home and relax for awhile.  I'll write more about it later, but that's all for now.  Peace out.
