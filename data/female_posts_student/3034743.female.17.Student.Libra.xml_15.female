Society has made it into a huge event with the glorification of prom in movies. Many teen movies involve prom. Why is that? It is just a dance...a "special" dance. What makes it so special? I don't really get it, but I'm not sure I care enough to get it in the first place. Sure, I'm excited for it and what not, but I just don't understand all the hype. Whatever.
