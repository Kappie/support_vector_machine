This morning , a particular consultant took us for a virtual walk down memory lane , and re-enter the maize that I personally have never been able to find a way out of ... BIOCHEMISTRY. honestly initially i did try ( VERY HARD) to understand what dr. M was trying to get across to us .. but after about 20 mins, i gave up .. got completely lost. The fact that this particular consultant used soooo many analogies wasnt helping either. i'm not trying to defend myself here ( cos biochem has NEVER been my cup of tea!), but had he used less analogies and given us more hard, straightforward facts to grease the rusty cogwheels in this brain of mine, i would probably have found his seminar interesting and USEFUL. i mean, a lil' bit of fancy analogy is useful but one really shouldn't go overboard with it. and to 'cement' ( im borrowing dr m's words here!) what he has 'taught' us this morning, we now have to go home and write an essay to explain the anapleurotic something something of the TCA cycle. hahaha.. something something.. i have to go ask someone else in the group what bits of the essay title ive missed out. i dont know whether i missed out on the something something because i was taken aback by this rather unfamiliar terminology ' anapleurotic' , or whether becos my ears were just playing deaf ... as usual. if that sounds like a mighty task to do with the FINALS just 5 weeks away ( gulp!) in this essay we have to explain how failure of understanding why the TCA CYCLE and the Urea cycle are actually a bi-cycle lead to the imprisonment of sally clarke and trupti patel for allegedly commiting infanticides. So God help me please ......   ps: *sigh* the day after tomorow .. is tomorow now .. i think i have cried enough in preparation for the actual moment......afterall its only gonna be for a month before i see my beloved golliwog again ....
