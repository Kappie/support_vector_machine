Saturday was full of jobsto earn some well earned cash, and Sunday was rather light with the 'joy' of going to see Thunderbirds....          Ok, im going to stop talking like that now, its really starting to annoy me.        So as you can see that was my weekend.Not too bad, but not great for someone whos starting to climb walls ( i really dont know what i mean by that, but i will include it anyway).     Got dragged along to see 'Thunderbirds', where the cinema was FULL of screaming little brats, one of them i had to put up with kicking the back of my chair through-out the ENTIRE film.I really did have to resist the urge to turn round and have a go at the little gremling.     I think i deserve a medal of some sort.     In my opinion the film was badly acted and the storyline was extremly poor.It was a slow start but near the end it got more interesting (if you could say that).     It was crap but watchable.          Also whilst in Lincoln my parents descided to buy my birfday prezzie.You must understand that they brought it in front of me, the bloke in the shop let me look at it...and then it was taken off me, not to be seen again for 16 days.     I think it was rather cruel.     But when we got home, they put it in the kitchen....and so i sneaked in there to have a look.     And while i had a quick look, i transfered my numbers from my old fone to my new one.And also picked my ringtone, and message tone....and wallpaper.....and skin.....and played one of the games called 'Go!Hamster'.....and set the clock and date.      So really it wasnt a quick look...............Hmmm.              So to my ickle fwendies (if your reading this), my fone is 'out of order' until the 6th of August because im keeping my old number and its being transfered.       But i wont get any messages (not like anybody txt's me...but you must on my birfday) unti the 11th :D.           Wow ive really gone on.     So Goodbyb!           p.s- Dazu have a guten holiday! :D              Image by  urlLink FlamingText.com
