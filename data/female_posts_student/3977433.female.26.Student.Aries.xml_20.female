Heh, um, rrrrrright.      No, but seriously, where did everyone go?      My back hurts today, and it's from all the lifting I'm doing at work. I even do it the right way. Probably the 13 yrs of snowboarding that did my back in. Oh well, it was worth every season.       I am going to make an egg with cheese and butter on a toasted bagel. YUM! I'm so hungry. OH YEAH!! Fuckers at Tim Hortons raised the price of tea to a retarded $1.50!!! I'm not buying it from there anymore. That's even more then coffee. I guess they thought that they weren't making enough money..... ?      I will post a picture again,   through the title of this blog  , and YOU BETTER LEAVE A COMMENT about what you think about it. Good or bad.       Talk to you soon!         -Anna, Wish and Gus.
