I was just going to get my mom to pick me up from school at 10:20, during 2nd period, so I would have gone to Algebra II and part of English, but I don't want to do my Algebra homework. So my problem is whether to do my Algebra homework or not. She never checks to see if you have it.  But what if I come in Thursday and she asks me for it? I asked to people what they would do, and one said nope, they wouldn't do it. The other said yep, they would. Great. I guess I am going to have to make this decision for myself then. I'm going to say no. I'm not going to do it. I'm going to sleep in and go to my orthadontist appointment then 4th period.  I'm not doing my Latin either... I wonder what'll happen Thursday with that...
