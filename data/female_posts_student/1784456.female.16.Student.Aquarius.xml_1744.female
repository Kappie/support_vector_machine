But I'm not really sad cause my brother was with me :P Ahh and we skipped dinner. Yeay! (Totally because my parents aren't here) Mmm... should fit revising in somewhere. Kind of non-existant at the moment. Ooops... Well socialising is more important anyway :P Cause it's too easy to forget your friends and not arrange to do anything. That's why I have to drag all your butts out of your houses and get you guys to do stuff! Really :P And you lot are soooo heavy! *hehe tis fun to insult peeps when they can't insult me back* Anyway, I think I might have burned off som calories while I was typing so I'll have to go back downstairs and eat more chocolate. Remember. If it's fair trade it tastes better.
