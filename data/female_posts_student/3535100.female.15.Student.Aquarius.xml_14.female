So i go back to the motorhome, and sat down and thoughtI was oka and get up to get Lyndsey her present from me and fall, and staret bawling cause my right side was killing me...mom started freakin out saying if it kept uip we would have to leave even though we didnt have ne insurance cards ((*cuz dad switched jobs*)) so i take like 4 pills and its oka not gone, but a little better. Today was the fun race Lyndsey went out 2nd round.then i go to bed!        *Thursday*-HmM...test n tune was today I think.
