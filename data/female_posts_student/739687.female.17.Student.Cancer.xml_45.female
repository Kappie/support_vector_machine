School, band, homework, school, band, homework, school, band, homework....yea, you know what's missing in there? A LIFE! This is how it SHOULD be: party, party, sleep, eat, eat, eat, party, party, be crazy, party, party, eat, sleep, party, orgy, orgy, party, sleep, sleep with random people...hahaha...you get it, right? I'm...kidding about the sex stuff of course. But the partying is always fun! And eating...and occasionally sleep. Ok, this is so pointless it makes me wanna cry. So I'm gonna go do homework(how did u guess...) and then find other ways of wasting my time. Au revoir.
