But I fixed it and it's all good now. I changed it to another one of my favorites.  Why do ducks have webbed feet? To stamp out fires. Why do elephants have flat feet? To stamp out burning ducks. ((cha))  today was.... Well it was pretty damned aggravating. We did standardized test practice in all my classes. Once again, I hate standardized test practice. I thought to myself "one more bubble, one more scan-tron, one more stupid question about the distance from the earth to the sun.. And I'll explode". Thankfully, I did not explode, I simply tried to ignore the fact that so many trees died so the teachers would have something to waste my time with. But I was in a good mood.   so a cow gets artificially inseminated and she goes back to the pasture and tells all her friends "hey guys, today I got artificially inseminated!" and they're like "seriously?!" and she's like "yeah, no bull". ((cha))((cha))  this morning on the way to school I argued with mom about going to dad's. She pretty said the same stuff and we didn't make any kind of progress, so I'll probably end up dropping the whole idea to, yes, avoid more confrontation.  tonight was Sadie Hawkins. I don't even feel a little bad about it because I HATE cafeteria dances. And besides, I know it's mainly for stupid freshman. For some reason, all the freshmen seem to fit into the same group depending on what year it is. Last year, we had freshmen who couldn't care less and did horribly, but this year we have gawky and brainy little freshmen who are constantly competing to see who can get the best grades. It's quite aggravating.   today I got lots of hugs. I can remember when someone would come up to me and I would almost cringe. But since I've gone to magnet and EVERYONE wants to squeeze me, I've come to love the friendly embrace and find it quite lovely. I find the atmosphere of my school to be so comfortable that it's like living in some kind of unisex, anything goes, everybody loves everybody else, we will still love you if you're a boy and you wanna kiss other boys, same for girls, you can worship the devil and still be a nice person kind of way. I absolutely love magnet, too bad it's a school where I'm forced to learn stuff and not just a big daycare for older kids. But really, I don't think there is another school like it out there.   I'm gonna fix up the layout tonight, I've been itching to play with it but I have no idea what to do. Suggestions?   aside from that, I'm going to play disgusting amounts of internet pool. I didn't bother making plans because all I could think about was sleeping.   as for the whole Devon will do the dishes and give me five bucks in exchange for doing her report, she made an A+ but has already started bitching about the conditions of the agreement. Luckily I wrote everything down and made her sign it. So tonight she was all like "noooo it starts on Sunday!" and "it was only 5 days not 7!". But mom backed me up and she got yelled at and it was funny.   to me, it's crazy how much stuff changes as you get older and how standards fluctuate so much. If I had handed that report in to my English teacher, I would have failed, but Devon made an A+?  I remembered a story about my algebra teacher. It was when mom was in the hospital with a staph infection((like rosie says, staph is no laugh)) and I went to the hospital everyday after school and talked to momma. Well I turned in a blank worksheet and I wrote a note of apology with my main reason for not doing it being that my mom was in the hospital. When I got the paper back there was a note scrawled on the side saying "sitting around at a hospital is a perfect place to do homework". I don't think I've ever been more offended. Of course I realize now that  bitch was right, but at the time I was so worried about momma I was sickened at her lack of sympathy. I remember writing her about 4 horribly long notes about how family was more important than school and how she was a mean old cow, but of course I tore them up and moved on with life.   I remember when I was little and I had a babysitter who gave me a bath and I was so nice and cozy after the bath I decided to hide in my mom's huge king size bed with millions of pillows. Well I fell asleep, of course, and the babysitter didn't know where I was and never thought to look under the pillows on the bed. So when I woke up my mom, the babysitter, and a police officer were standing in our foyer talking. I thought I had done something wrong so I went back and hid in the bed again. My mom says the policemen found me eventually, sleeping in the next room. I've always loved that story, and it's one of the few things I remember from when I lived in Texas.  1. I skipped second and fourth grade. 2. ^that makes me the youngest sophomore in caddo parish. 3. I hate the baz lurman version of Romeo and Juliet. 4. I love the zeffirelli version of Romeo and Juliet. 5. My favorite playwrite is MOLIERE. 6. I like to read books 2-3 times in case I missed something. 7. I read Island of the Blue Dolphins 9 times, it's one of my favorites.  btw if you haven't tried any MOLIERE, you should. I've read Tartuffe, The School for Husbands, and Misanthrope. And if you do decide to pick up a copy, don't freak out when it's written in rhyme. The way it's done makes it even funnier. I also love cyrano de bergerac, but it's so.... Overdone?    today I was feeling frisky so I walked a mile. While I was walking I had nothing to do so I talked to myself in French, simply making up words if there was one I didn't know. "J'aime marcher" "J'adore aller a une promenade au primtemps" "Ce jardin est moche" ((heather will have to correct my mistakes))   I love you all!
