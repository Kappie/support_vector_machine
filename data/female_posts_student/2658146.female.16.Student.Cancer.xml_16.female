Movies like that tend to do that to me. I cried because I did a horrible thing yesterday. I played with someone's emotions like a toy bulldozer. I'll never forget the look on his face when he found out it was a joke. He looked angry, like he wanted to hit me. I wouldn't have blamed him if he did. I kind of wish he did though. I deserve it. When I looked him in the eyes, I was so afraid. Not for what would happen to me, but what would happen to him. I didn't know what he was going to do, to me or himself. I thought he didn't want anything to do with me ever again. It wouldn't suprise me if that had been the case. We worked it out and called it even since he had played a joke on me too, but I still feel so bad since I had played with his emotions, and his joke was much more shallow. I'll never forget yesterday. I don't think I'll ever be completely over it, either. He forgave me for what I did, and I forgave him for what he did, but I still can't forgive myself. I never will. I don't know how he can be such a forgiving person. Or how he can put up with my dishonesty or selfishness or how incredibly ill-tempered I can be. I don't think I'll ever forget his kindness, either.   Current Mood:  Sad
