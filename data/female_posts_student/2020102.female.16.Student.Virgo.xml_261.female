I said, "I was told to be smiles and bright eyed happiness, but sometimes I can't find anything to laugh at." "I don't want to be here." you said. It seems like I almost always have that effect on everyone. I say to myself, "You aren't the first one to think like me." And I just want to be like everyone else. Why can't I be everything to everyone else, or maybe just to you? Just once I would like to be something. And I wouldn't mind if you'd like to be with me. -Saves the Day, "When It Isn't Like It Should Be..."  Don't leave yet  it's still early and I haven't even said a word  and I'm hoping that I might upset you by saying what I want to  Cause it's not like you don't know I've fallen for you  but it's in my head and that's where you can't see it  and I thought that maybe if I had to bite the tips of my fingers  I could stumble over words  and tell you just how far before I hit the ground  -Saves the Day, "The Choke"  Can't you look at me once? And please if you got a minute, enjoy this lonely sky with me. It'll swallow us whole if we only let it. -Saves the Day, "Sell My Old Clothes, I'm Off to Heaven"  When do I get to wake up to you? Today I can't forget that I've got these open wounds It's such a drag I can't forget you've gone My ribs have parted ways They said, "We're not going to protect this heart you have..." You've left me here in the cold And I miss you You never told me it would be this hard. -Saves the Day, "You Vandal"
