They'd put the needle on a record, they they'd spin the turntable forward and backward violently, thereby creating unique, by which I mean ugly, noises. I used to do that when I was seven, and my mom would yell, 'STOP FOOLING WITH THE RECORD PLAYER!' But these guys were serious; they had expressions of intense concentration, as though it took vast artistic skill to simulate the sound of deranged squirrels fighting in an amplifier." -Dave Barry,  Dave Barry is Not Taking This Sitting Down!   "To really understand the mysteries of the universe, you should look at it first-hand. The best time to do this is at night, when the universe is clearly visible from lawns. As you gaze at it, many age-old questions will probably run through your mind, the main one being: Are you wearing shoes? The reason I ask is, recently I was standing barefoot on my lawn, and I got attacked on the right big toe by a fire ant. This is an extremely ungracious style of insect that was accidentally imported into the southern United States from somewhere else, probably hell." -Dave Brary,  Dave Barry's Greatest Hits   "when will i learn to be alone?/ how can i learn to let go of you?/ everyone can see me,/ but i can't see myself./ have you seen the key that leads to me?/ why do i suck at putting smiles on their faces...?/ why am i only funny to myself?/ how come no one understands what i say.../ but i thought i didn't know myself./ i hate everyone/ but only on certain days./ i think you're all annoyed by me,/ so i'll leave,/ and find myself." -rooney  "i try and clear my mind of you. you're wasting all my days, but i don't know just what to do without you in my way. i've spent all year avoiding everything else, they don't matter... i try and get as close as i can, but now i have been shattered. shut me out and i'll scream a shout - i can't be alone - say goodbye and i want to die. don't leave me alone... i think about you constantly. i don't have a choice, but when i just want to relax, i need to hear your voice. i've spent all year avoiding everything else - they don't matter. i try and get as close as i can... but now i have been shattered."-rooney  The era immediately after World War I came to be known as the "Roaring Twenties," and with good reason: Each of the years had a "twenty" in it, as in 1923, 1925, and so forth. Also there was a lot of wild and zany activity, with "flappers" going to "speakeasies" where they would listen to "jazz," dance the "Charleston," and drink "bathtub gin" until they "puked" all over the "floor." -Dave Barry,  Dave Barry Slept Here
