Less?  So it's finished: cold and calculated, or just concluded. Simply done. When? how? why do we let outside perception get in the way of what's real and true and sharp? But isn't there a song? "What's the use of crying?" I'm not even there yet. What's the use of anything more than carrying on, as usual? Maybe strength is all I need--not just now, but always. It's funny...whenever I say my little agnostic prayers to a forgiving God, it's for a lot of different things but always the strength to handle things no matter what happens. And I write it all over the place, too. Just some sort of cure-all for whatever gets in the way. It's a good umbrella wish.  And somehow, someone is working his magic, and it's working on me.  As of now, I have to do Spanish homework and studying, finish math, and somehow balance tutoring with M and meeting with M--what was his last name again? Shoot, and I have to find the address too.  From the metaphysical to the mundane.  Right now I'm considering going to bed and then waking up way early to finish whatever it is I have to do (except that pesky schedule conflict remains unresolved--why couldn't I just realize how important it was to call to tell them that I couldn't tutor anymore in the first place?) I feel bad that M might have to find out too late and just wait around school until 4 or something, but then again M of the E is an adult and an attorney at that, and I'd feel flakier for missing that appointment if it weren't for the fact that M would probably have to wait. And she paid me for this week, too! (for a change!)  No serious piano today, though. :( what the hell, I instinctively did a happy face.  I am sick of quarter notes and eigthththth notes and metronomic rhythms, but ironically, that stuff is playing in my head now. Simple, classical classical. A Major or E-flat Major. Twangy, happy stuff. soothing.  To bed! March!
