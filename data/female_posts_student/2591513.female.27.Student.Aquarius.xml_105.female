I guess you can say I am having a hard time with the latest transition in my life, leaving behond a past I held onto so dearly...but in life we have to learn to let go of things...the hate we carry with us, the love we thought was forever, the friendships that no longer remain the same...but we can hold onto the memories and the wonderful times that we have.  Those wonderful memories were all captured in those pictures.  All the love flooded back and I couldn't help but smile at the memories that bombarded me with each passing picture.  High school wasn't as bad.  I guess I carried me the last year...all the bad things that happened that I somehoe pushed back the great memories that I experienced.  For example...I had a lot of pictures of Senior Prom.  I remember the drama of getting a group of 13 people together for dinner... the nightmare of the tabs...UGH  Why is it so difficult to divide a tab?  But I saw the joy in our faces...I miss those people.  I miss the people that at one point in my life, I depended on for my own survival.  Now I look back on those pictures and realize that most of them have been out of my life for years now.  We have every intention of keeping friendships, but get so caught up in our lives.  I know that I had a difficult time fitting into my role as a wife and mommy, so I focused on that rather than my friendships.  Then before I knew it my friends and I slowly drifted into strangers and now the people who were the closest to me became the most distant.  But I hold in my heart everything each of those people meant to me, did for me, and endured for me.  As far as high school friends go, they were the cream of the crop, the most loyal and devoted friends...but as life would have it, people change and people drift and people follow different paths...maybe one day we will remeet and forge new different friendships.  I love looking at old photos because it brings back happy memories and becuase I am not FAT in them.  haha  No, but really, I love seeing the times when high school drama seemed like the world was going to end.  Boy were we dumb!  Soon after high school I got married and a had a medical crisies with my first born.  No drama came close to any of the ordeals I went through with my son.  But like with everything it is fun to visit, but to to live.  So I will close the album and take with me my fond memories and look forward to the new memoires I will make with my new friends, my family, my husband, and my children.
