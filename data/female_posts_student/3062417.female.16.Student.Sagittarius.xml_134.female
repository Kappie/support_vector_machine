I'm even sick of my friends and people in general. I'm not sick of everyone, there's certain people that I can hang out with and never ever get sick of. I just wish everyone wouldn't take me for granted and think that I'm always going to be there. Well guess what? I'm not. Some day I'm going to be gone and when you need me most I'll be nowhere to be found. Whatever, who really cares anyways right? I mean I don't think any of my friends even read this crap anyways so why does it matter to them? Why do I matter to anyone?  Monday- Went shopping and bought new shorts. I hate going shopping with Emily. She's really fucking embarassing. Sometimes I just hate her so much for what she's done. When I think about it I realize how much my life is going to absolutely suck in about a month. It makes me wish I could just get away somehow or even that I wasn't a part of this fucked up family.  Tuesday- I had to babysit Paige. It was really boring and the pool was really cold. Then I went right from Paige's to field hockey. It was so hot out. I thought I was going to die. I don't remember the score but I think we lost by 1 goal. We should have won though because Beany scored 2 of the goals for the other team because they didn't have enough people.  Today- I'm kind of sore from field hockey yesterday. I have a game today at 5:30 against Whitesboro. And right now I'm just talking to Gavin.  Not listening to anything today because I'm just to lazy to put a cd in the computer.
