At a certain moment, a doctor will determine that my brain has ceased to function and that for all intents and purposes, my life has stopped. When that happens, do not attempt to instill artificial life into my body by the use of a machine. And don’t call this my deathbed. Let it be called the “Bed of Life”, and let my body be taken from it to help others lead fuller lives. Give my eyes (sight) to the man who has never seen sunrise, a baby’s face or love in the eyes of a woman. Give my heart to a person whose own heart has caused nothing but endless days of pain. Give my blood to the teenager who was pulled from the wreckage of his car, (so that he might live to see his grandchildren play). Give my kidneys to one who depends on a machine to exist from week to week. Take my bones, every muscle, every fiber and nerve in my body and find a way to make a crippled child walk. Explore every corner of my brain. Take my cells, if necessary, and let them grow, so that someday a speechless boy will shout at the crack of a bat and a deaf girl will hear the sound of rain falling against her window. Burn what is left of me and scatter the ashes to the winds to help the flowers grow.   	If you must bury something, let it be my faults, my weaknesses and all prejudice against my fellowmen.  	Give my sins to the devil. Give my soul to God.  	If, by chance, you wish to remember me, do with a kind deed or word to someone who needs  your love.  	If you do all I have asked, I shall live forever.
