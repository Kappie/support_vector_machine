(pinch me. am i still breathing?)    if i don't find a way out... i might suffocate.  so.  tell me, tell me you know where i'm supposed to be.  it can't be here.  [can't be.]  and if it is...is it really worth it?  of course i'm not talking about the end.   the end is the beginning.   i'm talking about that new beginning.  that reason to smile. if i can't find it here...  maybe i've been in the wrong place all along.   but who knows.  i certainly don't.   "hoping is out of style, so look happy.  it's the end of the world."
