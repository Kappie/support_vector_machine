I saw a lot of Van Gogh's work in Musee D'Orsay in Paris which is my favorite museum of all time.     Mulberry trees are so awesome. I even have one in my front yard. Every year silkworms take it over and my dad starts a war them them and tries to kill all of them even though they are so cool and would never want to hurt anyone :(  The people who make crossword puzzles for the newspaper know way too many useless 3 letter and 4 letter words. Grrr.   I read an article in Business Week about the future of androids and now I'm really freaked out. For any of you who aren't freaked out about technology and the future be sure to see the disney original movie 'smarthouse'. That's only a mild example of the calamity that is yet to come.
