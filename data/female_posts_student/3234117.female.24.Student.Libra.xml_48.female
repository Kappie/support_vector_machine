The information I am going to divulge in is VERY important, so guys, especially sexually active guys, READ ON!  "No doubt your sex life with your girlfriend is already pretty rockin'.  But even so, to really blow her mind, there are some things you should pay close attention to.  See, while you're getting it on, she's probably taking mental notes of what you're doing.  IF she can give you a big gold star in certain areas, you'll secure your sex god status.  Just ask yourself the following questions.....  Do you initiate nooky equally?  Sure it's great when a woman jumps on top of you.  But you  both need to have an equal role.  "When you make the first move, she feels sexier and more desirable".-----I agree!  Does she have an O more often that not?  "Many women have a conflict about putting their own needs first.  The result:  She'll tell you to just go ahead without her.  But do you really think she doesn't want an orgasm? By trying your best to make it happen for her, it shows that you care about her sexual needs.  Do you shake things up in the sack?  If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right? Wrong! She's going to get bored if the sex is too predictable,  even  if it's pleasureable.  Do you kiss during sex?  In the heat of passion, you might be so caught up that you completely forget to kiss your girl.  But you'll earn points if you make it a priority to plant a few on her".  Okay well now you have it.  I hope you can be her best (ever!) in bed!
