I was reading old posts that I had written  I realized how much more effort I put into them.  They were actually enjoyable.  Now it's like whatever, blah, blah, says something random, talks some more, hopes for a comment, comes online and looks but nobody has actually commented.  OK, I'm going to continue to lead my boring existence and read my book some more.  If anybody has any suggestions as to something productive I could do, tell me, maintenant.
