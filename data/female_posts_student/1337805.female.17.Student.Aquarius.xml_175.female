That her brother might be telling her stuff. That what she speaks is true. But she won't tell me what she knows. If she knew what he and me had shared, done, maybe then she'd realize. But how to ask without telling?  It's hit me. He's been acting like his friend. Using me for sexual purposes. I hated it the first time, and I won't like it this time. I'm so worried.   Maybe my love is based on a lie.
