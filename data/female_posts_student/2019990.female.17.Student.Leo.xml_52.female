But I better not see a sign reading... "Introcuing, The New Pittsburger" until I get my royalty money.   Today was a busy day at the ofice, we had even less patients than yesterday, but they all had many things wrong, either physicaly, or emotionally.  One little old lady came in today, and she has a bit of dimensia.  The staff had been encouraging her for years to get a mammogram, and she never would.  So today they found a lump in her breast, and they tried to get an appointment set up with the oncology doctors, she looked so scared. I felt awful for her.  That will be one of the hardest parts of being a doctor.  I think I'm realy going to have trouble not telling people about my cases too.  I find this stuff really interesting, so I'm going to have to marry some one with a strong stomache.  We also discovered a drug addiction in one of the post op patients.  She was trying to get herself more pain pills than she should have had, and so the pharmacy did a background check on her, and it turns out she's had enough pain pills in the past few months to sedate a horse.  Frightening isn't it?  But on the brighter side of things, I learned how to do a urine test today.  So I can help out with those in the Ukraine if needed.  That's good. I had the craziest dream last night.  I drempt that Leila had become really good friends with one of the horniest guys at our highschool.  If you knew me in Junior high, it's my seventh grade crush. And I was pretty uneasy about that, but I was like whatever, as long as nothing bad happens.  But then they started tormenting me, and I ended up leaving them, and I found Wonder Woman and some of her friends and my ninth grade crush, hung out with them for a while, until they began to shun me as well.  Then I headed into the gym, and  found Mahinda, Abner, Aden, and Paco.  They didn't shun me.  And I really don't know what this dream means, because Leila and Wonder Woman wouldn't do that, unless they had some sort of conspiracy to gain my trust.  They're probably just trying to get close enough to find out the secrects of the Universe!  Well, here's their warning.  I'l never tell!   So going to the office is done for this week.  Now begins the manic packing so we're not staying up until 5 am Saturday, and skipping church to pack.  Tomorrow we had a 6 am prayer meeting to get prayed over before we leave, and then we're sleeping and packing.  Lenni's graduation is tomorrow as well.  We're alo going out to dinner on Saturday to celebrate.  And more good news, Xander got his drivers liscense today.  He passed his test.  So your's truly doesn't have to do any drving in the frightening city.  Joy! Oh man, this is getting long.  Sorry about that.  Talk to you all later.
