So I got all of my information/profile page filled out. Man, was that interests list a bitch! I have 200 intrests on my  urlLink greatestjournal , so I had to edit all of that down to get like... 15 interests. Fuck that.  But yea, now it is done. And I even made and uploaded a nice little profile icon/picture thing too. Me= pleased.     In other news, I saw the midnight showing of  Spiderman 2  on Tuesday night/Wednesday morning. IT FUCKING ROCKED MY [TUBE]SOCKS!!!! It was so awesome. You can read my excellent review of it from when I had just returned from the cinema  urlLink HERE .  It's SO worth spending your money on... so do so.      Yea, I like this blog because it is my ramble-away-about-not-really-anything-but-somethings journal. I mean, I have SO many other blogs, but this one is really nice.   I've got my  urlLink regular greatestjournal . This is for my normal posts about things that I find interesting, fun/random updates, and my  urlLink OneWord  writings. It's basicly my default blog.  Then I have my  urlLink Rants and Raves greatestjournal . That's for my opinionated posts about politics and such.    Another one is my  urlLink livejournal , my totally private journal where I am free to post my true feelings on things, situations, and people without the scare of high school drama/gossip/tattle-tale/ridicule/etc. Bill is always trying to weasel his way into this one to see things that I have said about him.   I also have my  urlLink melo (melodramatic journal)  for my more artsy and darker posts. This is where I spill my prose and poetry. The site is down half the time, and not many people know about Melo anyway, so I would never rely on this as my normal blog. I don't think you can see it unless you are a member anyway.   I rarely use my  urlLink xanga , but that's for the Columbia River IB webring with the same people from the forum, so that doesn't really count. (I think that I have just as many aquaintances from River than I do Skyview... but I have never met any of them). *shrug*   Then there are the ones that I never use, like my  myspace , and my  blurty , and my  woohu , and my  minilog , and the couple of actual free  websites  that I created and attempted to have journals on, and thousands of other blogs that I have started and never gotten back to.   Ah well.      Oh, I downloaded the little  blogthis  thing for your toolbar. That's what I am using right now. Pretty spiffy, I'm telling you.    But now I am off... it is 2:30 in the AM, and I am bored, so I think that I am going to search for people on blogger that have my same interests... or taste in books/movies/music.  See ya!
