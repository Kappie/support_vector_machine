All of a sudden it starts raining, this is the second time this has happened to me this week. It is also starting to anger me, Hopefully the ground will dry up so I can go out and do what I originally intended to do.  On another note, I have a cell phone. On my cell phone I get charge a certain amount of money for the amount of minutes I use. Now that you understand this, let me say that I don't want to here about some dork starring at your funbags for fifteen minutes. I don't know how Jackie did it, but she was able to turn that one simple event into an hour long lecture about how I shouldn't stare at her boobs. I not only lost an hour of my life, but, I also lost money. Something I will never be able to get back.   There are somethings in this world you will never get back.
