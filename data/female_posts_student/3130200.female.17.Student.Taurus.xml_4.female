But, I went at midnight so the scenery was lost in the darkness and all I could hear was the rushing waters of the Big Thompson river.  On my way up to Estes, I nearly had a stroke when my headlights shone brightly on the figure of a deer standing calmly on the side of the road waiting for me to pass.  It took me by surprise and my hand flew to my chest and I shouted "Oh my god" then laughed at myself for doing so.  I drove into Estes and of course the roads were barren.  It was like the town was shut down, I saw a handful of cars and even fewer people.  I flirted with the idea of going into Rocky Mountain National Park, but decided to save that for another midnight drive.  As I headed back down the mountain a fox darted out in front of my jeep.  I stomped on the brakes and swerved just enough to the right to let it turn around and scamper back to the other side of the road.  I think it almost had a stroke.  I love the drive to Estes, the curvy mountain roads and the crisp smell of pine and fresh air clear my head.  Ok, so the real reason I decided to post tonight is because I'm a little bit pissed off at the parents.  They made a severely bad decision.  Family vacations have always been pretty good.  We've traveled to some really great places: Maine, Boston, California, Oregon, Canada, Florida, and Alaska just to name a few.  The one we were planning was going to be the best.  We decided a few months ago that we would all like to go to Mexico.  Plans were made, but nothing was set in stone until they both finally got the vacation time scheduled for the end of August (the 18-25 to be exact...just in time for school to start on the 30th).  Anyway, we normally purchase plane tickets much earlier but there was a lot of hullabaloo about the vacation time for my dad and that didn't get straightened out until last week.  Fast forward to two days ago, my uncle calls from North Dakota and says that my cousin (brief background-had a stroke 7 years ago and consequently cannot use many of his left extremities including his hand, fingers, and facial muscles...leg works fine) just had surgery to fuse his left hand in place to prevent movement due to the fact that his tendons tense up a lot and they have to constantly surgically stretch them.  Doctor says it was the best and most humane option.  The decision was made, behind the doors of the master bedroom, that we are going to forego our magical paradise vacation that is Manzanillo, Mexico, for a seven day-six night stay in glorious North Dakota.  2 days included for driving.  Now I ask you, who would pass up 2 days of driving in a Suburban filled with 5 people that seems shrinks in size every mile as you cross the barren wasteland that is Wyoming, South Dakota, and North Dakota?  Added bonus, 5 days in a crappy, stinky, dirty motel room in a hodunk town named Minot.  Also included in your package is the uncomfortable conversation with relatives you haven't seen in 4 years.  And, if you call within the next five minutes, I'll add in a reminder which will haunt you every minute of your miserable summer vacation...you could have been on a beach in Manzanillo, Mexico relaxing as the waves crash against the shore. But, the real question still remains...why am I up at 3 in the morning writing about this?
