I have a meeting tomorrow with Henry (my direct supervisor) about the training stuff I'm helping with this summer.  I haven't seen him since last Tuesday... I was supposed to see him Thursday evening, however his Dad passed away, and so he and his wife flew to Oklahoma for a funeral.  I sent him a sympathy card on Friday... I'm glad that he and his wife are okay and don't seem to be grieving too much.  He's a pretty tough guy, though... retired Colonel, ya know... that's how they tend to be.  Anyhow... I'm off to eat dinner with my Mom.  My Dad's playing golf this evening, so it's just the two of us.  I hope she got wraps from Chik-fil-A.  Those are my FAV!  :-)
