Mwhahahahaahhaha.......o well thats me!!  got asked today why i  HATE  katie and especially danielle, well to be honest i dont really no, it mainly stems from the past when danielle got tia merit to beat cat l up at the fair, and lost alot of my blonde hair that night, but ahaha she got a punch in the face............ anyway some would say that i shouldnt bare a grudge, but its not just that, its everything she represents is more or less everything  i hate in todays world. the many people who wander round thinking they are something special, that they are gods gift, that we should respond to there every demand, that we should wipe there arses, that they deserve our respect because they can be mouthy, when infact the real special people that deserve everything they want are people like Haz, Kat, Char, Stefie, Cat, Vic, Sandie, Chris, Jordan, Joe, Adam, Dan.K, ........etc.....  ahhhhh today.....what a beautiful day INDEED lol ( a joke not many of you will understand) started off with the PE exam, that was very weird, all the questions seemed to be mainly common sense answer, which worries me because i always ALWAYS never write the correct thing, lol. anyway apart from that.......was nice, people came round mine and we spent the afternoon on the garden eaten ice cream - wow how much ice cream do i have in the house you will not believe lol - anyway some had to leave early boohooboohoo, but Haz and Kat stayed a while longer woohoowoohoo,  YOU ARE WELCOME ANYTIME  (just let me no first, i wouldnt want you stranded on my doorstep)woohoo i had such fun, was so nice, we had a giggle didnt we? well i hope you all enjoyed yourself?!?!?!?!?   "DONT LET THE WORLD BRING YOU DOWN  NOT EVERYONE HERE IS THAT FUCKED UP AND COLD"    (remember that in times when it feels like the complete opposite) (great lyrics from a great band who i must thank  Char  and  Stefie  for introducing me to - there lyrics are so powerful and meaningful)  right well i must be off yayayayayayay love ye Nat xXxXxXXxXxXxXxx       yay to the reappearance of the fairies
