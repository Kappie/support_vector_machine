That was nice. And now I'm starting to think that maybe I should start planning more things, working on my "look", cutting down on tv, and eating less.   My life goals are completely opposite from my everday life. Funny how that works.  However, I am very excited for the debut of sex and the city on tbs (I have basic basic cable, so I have only been able to rent seasons...and that sucks). My vcr is already set to record every single episode. Ok, ok, I know I am a total reject, but the idea of watching pretty women fail at relationships is one of the brighter aspects of my day.   YAY!  Plus, my cousins come in on Tuesday! Woot! One is 6 and the other is 4...I think. Something like that...I lose track. Anyway, they are cute as hell, and I can't wait to babysit them. (Plus, that means money, but that isn't nearly as important). At least it will get me out of bed and keep me from sleeping my days away (when I'm not working). Mom says I have to get a second job though. God damn her. She is like hell in a fucking box. GRR.  I really want to talk to ben. I am sure he couldn't care less about me, but I really really just want him to hear me out sometime. We used to   talk about anything. I hope he doesn't mind listening to me. I just want him to know how I feel, and I want to know how he's been feeling lately...  I miss ben. *sigh* I scared him away by liking him. damn me damn me damn me.  I need to go finish crying now. Ta ta.
