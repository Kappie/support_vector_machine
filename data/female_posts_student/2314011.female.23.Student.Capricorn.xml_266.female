I'm gonna resist; we're going to have a great time without going  there ; it's not the best idea with things the way they are for her back home; I don't even really  want  to go there; we can just be really good friends...really!  And for a while, I pull it off pretty well.    And then there's The Kiss.  The kiss I avoid the first little while she's here.  Not the 'hello' kiss or little cuddle kisses.  Those are fine and innocent.  I'm talking about the one that opens the door to other things.  As usual, I avoided it last night, vowing to myself that we would talk about the state of affairs back on the homestead.  At last update, they were on the equivalent of 'a break' and I convinced myself I wouldn't try anything funny while things were in such a precarious state.  And as usual, The Kiss happened.  And all my resolve, strength, lofty ideals about what should and shouldn't happen melted away.    Thank god I escaped to work before things got crazy.  I'm reassured by the lack of "I still love you!" feelings, but am a bit nervous about the "I'm still attracted to you" feelings.    Sigh.  Such a worry.
