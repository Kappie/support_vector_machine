It was a light flight so there wasn't too much baggage. Then it was off to the high school to join up with the  urlLink STARtrek Science Show  team at Hedland Senior High School. I joined up with the Physics session and never had more fun building bridges from straw and then testing their structures.  I had lunch with them all afterwards at the shopping centre after they bought food from where I would eat personally. ^_~ There are just some places where I simply don't reccommend.  And before I knew it, I was back at the airport for my final shift. I packed an amazing amount of bags into the hold. I was surprised as to how much I could fit into the hold. I will be returning the uniforms on Saturday instead of tomorrow. Work at the pharmacy is preventing that and today I'm feeling so drained.  And I'll launch into why I'm so drained.  I had ealier asked my mother whether it would be okay to move back into home in Perth to finish of my university degree. She said yes which was surprising considering I did move out after the ultimatum of "It's either your boyfriend, (now my fiancee), or family." and this was when the relationship was   long distance  . No surprise what I chose.  Anyhow, my mother hasn't mentioned anything of the move to my father. And she wants me to talk to my father about the move and see how he feels. Well I can already work this one out folks. My father has already said he doesn't want me in his life. He even told me that when I asked him straight out and he's even indifferent to the idea of my fiancee and I marrying. I suppose it is better than outright hostility. Anyway, I don't think my father will agree to me moving back home and even if he does, things will be made difficult. Frankly, I can do without all the hassles until after I graduate and even then I may not want to deal with it.  So now I'm waiting to hear back whether I am able to stay with a friend of my fiancee's. I hear back on Saturday. I'm not too optimistic about it to be honest but we'll see how things go before I hit panic stations even if it is only nine days before I leave Hedland.  I will graduate. I must.
