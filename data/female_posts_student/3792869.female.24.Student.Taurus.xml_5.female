Blame it on the problems I've been having in securing unconditional approval to start collecting data for my master's thesis. I meant to start collecting data for my thesis this summer, but those bastards at the Illinois Department of Corrections (yes, Steve Karr, I'm talking to you. Damn you to hell, and take your staff with you while you're at it!!!) are taking forever in processing my request, so that shit is up in the air for now. My job keeps me busy, but now I have a lot of reasons to go out and unwind after office hours, especially since I've had several people visiting me this summer. I've been drinking and partying more than once a week, which is so unlike me.   Robert (a.k.a. Budul, which means jellyfish in Waray) is in town for a visit this week, so we've been going out with our friend Rizza and her boyfriend Sherwin since Saturday. Most of the time, we end up having a drink before heading home. (Monday night was the only night I didn't drink with them because I went home earlier due to a headache.) Last night, we stayed out till 1:20PM or so. I didn't go to bed till 2AM. I ended up sleeping in till 9AM this morning--especially since I had such a bizaare dream about going to Chile as an illegal immigrant, despite the dangers, partly to get back at Papa for womanizing (which he denied in my dream, hehe). I know I have flexible hours, but I meant to be at work by 9AM so I could get stuff done before meeting up with Sr. Mary Miller and Sr. Beata for lunch, but I didn't get to leave the house till ten minutes to 11AM. It was 1125AM by the time I got here, so I just waited for the sisters at the lobby, where we had agreed to meet.  We had a good lunch at this restaurant called Mity Nice. Sr. Mary Miller had a gift card valid at that place. Haha, she successfully fished out whether or not I was considering the religious life and how long it's been on my mind. Sr. Beata just listened intently with a smile on her face, as she usually does. It's usually hard to get a straight answer from me because I just smile/laugh/stare at my feet whenever any of the Holy Spirit Sisters tease me about joining them or ask me about what I intend to do with my life. So Sr. Mary Miller was successful.   Sr. Mary Miller is a cool nun. She knows I've been partying a lot, but she told me to enjoy myself--it's part of college daw (maybe she means university/life as a single young adult in general because I'm done with college). It's hard to hide anything from her because I feel she can see right through me. She entered the convent at 14, left at 29 (I found out about her reasons for leaving this afternoon), and worked as an educator for 30 years before she re-joined the SSpS congregation at 60. She had to go through the whole nine yards of formation, and she's a junior sister again, but she's happy with her vocation. So if there's anyone who could discern with me whether or not I have a vocation, it has to be her. For some reason, her jokes always strike a chord within me. Awhile ago, she said it would be fine by her if I were to enter the convent in the Philippines, but added that of course, it would be better if I entered the convent here.  After lunch, we ended up passing by the John Hancock Observatory and the Water Tower because Sr. Mary Miller was taking Sr. Beata to the places where she could take her family, who's coming for a visit on July 22nd. I wish I could have hung out with them the whole afternoon, but I had this nagging thought about my needing to show up at work today. We parted ways after we left Water Tower. I could have gone with them to Sr. Mary Miller's office and to Navy Pier, and I know they planned to go home before rush hour anyway, but I decided to come here and put in a few hours for today. So here I am.   I just realized I could have taken off this afternoon and it wouldn't have been such a big deal and I kinda want to kick myself. I'm gonna see Sr. Beata on Sunday, when Elizabeth and I visit the Rogers Park community, but I have no idea when I'll see Sr. Mary Miller again (maybe when I get back from the Philippines in the fall). I feel like their asking me to hang out with them this afternoon was such a blessing that I overlooked when I chose to part ways with them right away. Awhile ago, when I was with them, it just felt so right and I didn't even feel they were nuns or "the other." It was as if I was one of them.  I have so much to pray about. God help me.
