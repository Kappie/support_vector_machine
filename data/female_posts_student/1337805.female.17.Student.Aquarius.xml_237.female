Oh, there they go....They weren't playing, and I thought it was cause of me...but evidently not. Darn them! I was listening to Moby, and they started playing so hard (prolly Nick on the drums) that it caused my cd to skip,....grrr...now I'm listening to it on the computer. I relaly need to drown them out :)  I love you Nicky!! *looks innocent :P)  Got an extra project for Multimedia, so that's pretty sweet. It's filming and editing Misha's biology project...very exciting stuff. It's really easy too, which is surprising but awesome.  Still recovering from CanUUdle. I should find out when the newsletter deadline is so I can write up a thing for it. Can't wait til I get my pics back, and really can't wait til Laura comes home tomorw.   Well, my friend has been committed (literally) so I'm going to go deal with him...it's kinda..hard.. love you all (especially those not playing loud stuff to drown out my music right now).
