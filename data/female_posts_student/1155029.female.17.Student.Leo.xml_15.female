So I Skipped keyboarding today to go to Millionaire Cafe with "I think that'll do" man. I think he may be the english department head. It was hillarious. Worth the whole trouble of editing those scholastic pieces. [questionable]. Missy almost fell out of her seat at several points, not to mention Sarah scaring the waiter half to death when he asked if he could take her plate and she delivered a smack down. [impressive].
