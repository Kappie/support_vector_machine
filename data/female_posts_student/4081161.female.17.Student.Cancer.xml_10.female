I just want to dissipate into the air like little vapours that float up from cups of Earl Gray tea. I think it would be marvelous to disappear or become someone else every time you get tired of yourself. A sort of ... Chronic Reinvention.       Right now my name is no longer Charlene Cristie Ann Ramirez Pirote. I am known simply as Ama. I have flaming white hair cut short close to my skull. I'm delicate and tall and I always wear platform shoes. I wear lots of mini-skirts made of leather and butterfly pins.       I work at a record store where they sell classic 45" record singles. Sometimes the shop gets slow because not a lot of youngsters know what 45" records are. It's a sad generation we live with. Some old timers come in my shop and donate some of their stuff. Mostly it's because they are moving to Senior Citizen centers and don't know where to place their memorabilia. None of their children want it, none of their grandchildren don't even know what they are. I accept them happily. I don't get a lot of money from this job, but I get by. I find having a small budget slims down my figure.       I live Mid-town where all the houses are old or falling apart. Mine just happens to be falling apart. I plant a lot of rambling rose bushes which have more natural beauty than the store-bought roses. I collect blue vases and line my six-foot wide, three foot high living room window. When the morning light comes in, it creates a euphoric mural of blue swivels, wisps, and tendrils on my wall. It makes a great contrast with my large and cushy red couch. On the weekends, I go to indie shows where the music is loud, the kids are high, and their hair is higher.       That's all for today. I think I'll be someone else tomorrow.
