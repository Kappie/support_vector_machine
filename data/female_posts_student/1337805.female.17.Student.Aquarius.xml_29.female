They only way I managed to get out before was because Samaya walked by and said she'd breakfast with me. We spent the weekend in each other's company, sight, arms. It was almsot like slow death when I had died my hair and we coulnd't kiss for fear of dying his beloved jersey. Finally, I went mad and washed it out before it was done, just so I could be near him. We colided together and kissed, and kissed. We danced that night, and watched Saved by the Bell together (with Dougie, who is very hot, by the way). Leaving was the hardest thing ever. We kissed goodbye, and with a wave, he was gone. No idea when I'd see him again. If I ever would.  Samaya was the other great thing there. After the stressof the non-meetings, and gonig from my room, on the 6th floor, to another building, for nothing I started to freak out. And she took me aside, and calmed me down, and talked me back into reality. When I left, I couldn't go without a hug from her, and as tears were running down my face in the sadness of leaving, like always, I thought of what a truelly great person she was. How she keeps everyone together. And with a kiss goodbye, she, and I, were gone.  I honestly can not wait for Fall Con in the fall, or the Advisor training in Sept, or the Regional Con and LDC in November. I can't wait to see everyone, to be with everyone, to experience this great love you get. I miss everyone. All I have are the pictures, and the thoughts in my head.
