I'm soo good at that, considering I do it every morning when my dad wakes me up for school.  Then we watched the MTV movies awards, and my mom picked us up and drove us to my house.  We played some slime volleyball, and then walked to Faich's house, which only took like half an hour, but Alicia enjoys exaggerating.  We got there at like 2:40, and we didn't get home until like 6:30.  Basically, we hardly sat down at all that entire time, except when we ate lunch at  Maido  so my feet hurt.  Bleh.  But oh my god, I totally want to get this totally awesome camera phone where you can rotate the camera thingy around so it can face you.  It's hard to explain, but whatever, it's awesome.   When I got home, Alicia left, and I went to hang out with Jamie, my next-door neighbor for those who don't know.  We watched  The Big Lebowski  which is a very funny movie and we watched  Alex and Emma  with Mia, his sister, who's like my best friend ever.  We started to watch  Grind  which I've wanted to see forever, and which Jamie has seen like 50 times, but my dad called and made me come home.  Which makes sense considering it was like already 11.  Eh, whatever.  I'll probably just finish watching it tomorrow.  Yay!  I *heart* Adam Brody.  ...la Gu
