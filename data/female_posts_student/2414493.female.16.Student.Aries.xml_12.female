Perhaps a superiority complex was involved, but this team was dumbed down: no objections, quiet witnesses, a clerk who figured out time using her cell phone calculator...lol, and it finally hits me right here that I'm really tired. It's interesting how mock trial teaches you to hate the guts of your opponents by trial's end.  BJ's tonight after the scrimmage. Sat at a table with some people I don't know at all, some people I know and some people I know very well. Julia and Ms. Harrison at the next table. So perhaps I'm breaking out of my shell, but it's still weird to be sitting in the orange half-light of the restaurant at 9pm with a football dude with a very long tongue (here J is excessively engrossed :)), with a bug named Charlie and Doupe and Jean and everyone. Maybe I'm beginning to understand Jean's theory that it's better to realize your intelligence, dumb yourself down and play it to your advantage with other people. J and H are still setting up conspiracies...they asked me if I could go to winter ball and I told them about orchestra and then, at the very end, they said something like, "oh, just kidding. you can go back to your seat now." And they talked to D about asking me. I don't know where in the world they're going with this, but I'll take it as it comes.  Perhaps with each passing day it's easier to let go more and more of the life I used to have as an oblivious and obsessed nerd--I guess that's the best way to put it. Not talking to R still bugs me, but I see him around with other people and it's like ok, fine, whatever. And in mock trial (which, btw, is bound to take over my life in the coming month) I'm comfortable enough--more than I deserve, actually, and so I shan't complain.  It's taken me 15 years to realize that life (particularly HS life) is a beautiful thing, and maybe I've finally come to terms with it tonight. Admittedly, I'm not ready to give myself over completely for there remain fundamentally Lydia parts in me, but I see now that there's greener grass on the other side. For all it's worth, I had a good day today...it isn't one of those days where you can say, ok, I've lived to the fullest and if I had to leave this world today I would be finished, but it's getting there.  So with little fear and less reservation, Lydia goes opportunity-hunting.
