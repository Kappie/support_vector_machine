I can't get sick of it yet.  Am thinking that I've just let myself do many random, frivolous things and I'd better crack down on this uncontrollable activity before it starts influencing more serious exploits, namely piano. I know it won't directly affect it--well, yes it will, in terms of practice time and mindset. I just know that what I do generally is probably going to seep into piano activities. I'd really like to do well in Bach. And once that's done, it's AP's and then a license, which shouldn't be all too bad.  Recycling bins are coming out to cost more than it should: Recy-CAL is $3593.91, J.
