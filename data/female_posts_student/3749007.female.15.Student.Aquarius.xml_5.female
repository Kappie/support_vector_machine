I wish I wasn't the kind  of person who was constantly changing my mind..but ya know, I'm thankful for it, too. Otherwise, I would've made a few bad choices..nothing life threatening, but all the same, they wouldn't have helped anything either.  New subject..  Don't go making all these promises you don't intend to keep... NO!  You'll only end up hurting you  the one you love.  Alright...well, I don't really have anything to say, so I think I'll be going now.. Thank you for your time.  Much love--
