Plus I felt lazy and tired in the morning, that's another reason why. Okxokx, let's just drop this subject. I was at home cleaning the  whole house  after i've had my breakfast[ or u might call that lunch ].  Geex ~ With the back problem, I definitely had a hard time. ~  Oh well ~ What's done is done. Oh yeah ! joan's coming my house later to study. Dunno about changtat and joan's  boyfren .  HeeHee ! Hmm.. I wonder how did the  seminar  go for all my classmates and schoolmates.* thinking *Should have at least  inspired  them to go to a certain course I think! Hahax. As for the  physics peer tutoring  after that?!! Hmmm.. That should be a lil worse huh?!  Buttttttt , for the sake of our  O's , we still have to hang on. Lol... Although I'm not there la. HehE. Ermmx... As long as Ipray foreveryoneto be able to score  very well for their O's with  flying colours ! As for myself, I  'double pray' ! Hehehe. ~PeAcE oUt~
