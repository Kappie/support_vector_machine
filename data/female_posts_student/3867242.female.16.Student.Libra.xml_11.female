Then since I got called off of work today, I went to Pizza Hut with Rachael and Kyle. Afterwards, we went to Giant Eagle to buy food, etc. because my mom doesn't have anytime this week to do that sort of thing. When I got home I watched Days of Our Lives, and I read my issue of Teen People that I bought. (Kristen Dunst is on the cover, they had a big back to school issue, but I can't think about that..it's too soon!) Then I went to my room, and watched "Catch Me If You Can". Awhile ago I ate dinner, we had tacos..yeah. Now, I'm typing crap about my really boring day, so no wonder why this post is extremely lame. At least I get to watch I love the 90s again tonight (Tonight, it's '96 and '97..so they're talking about the Backstreet Boys..that bring me back..haha.)  Tommorrow afternoon, I'm going to Old Home Days and meeting Daylin, Ashley, Mike and the usual crew to hang out. Then I'm spending the night at Daylin's sister Dana's house. Then on Saturday I might to go the parade and stuff. Then Sunday I'm going to church and then I'm back at work. So that's all I have..I'm sorry that I wasted your time with my craziness...haha
