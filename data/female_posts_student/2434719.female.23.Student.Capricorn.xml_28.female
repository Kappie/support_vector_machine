HOLY MOLY!  ten grand! i'm still pinching my self...  and it hurts.  so i'm going to stop.   what did i do to deserve this?? i don't have the words to describe my emotions when i got the phone call today. (you'd think i would, since i won based on my writing skills).   can i just say,  i'm proud of myself.    i celebrated tonight by going to the library.  nope, not the bar.  i figured hey, that's how i got this in the first place :)  goodnight, back to work!  I AM SO HAPPY!
