And that made me so happy. We talked about books, and movies, and a pinch of music. Talk of work and school, and the tone was light and sarcastic. And we laughed, god it's been too long since we've laughed together. And it wasn't an uncomfortable laugh. gah. i love it.      then work, and that was fantastic, I love Maurices, it's so fun. I fucking love it. LOVE IT! lol      except when I walk past Bri and get a shitty attitude because I'm upset with her? hm, doesn't make sense, considering i wasn't the one to lie to her, and ditch her, and put my feelings aside. Nope, that definately wasn't me.                                                      I feel like a ghost sometimes too.    6
