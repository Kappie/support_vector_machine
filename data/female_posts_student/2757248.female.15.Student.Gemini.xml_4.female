I actually kinda felt like i was crawling back to you and asking for forgivness when i called to thank you, but after i hung up the phone you only made me more proud of  "the oh so horrible thing saturday night brought." --so you say. But you make me feel like THE most disgusting person in the world when you talk to me about this, like i couldnt have done anything worse. I felt bad for doing it just because i knew i let you down, but since 10 minutes ago im proud as hell and i wish i coulda done what we did in your face. you said you want me to feel remorse.. well sweety im 14 years old and i pretty much asked for what he gave me so that pretty much screws any chances of me feeling remorse. The only thing i wish wouldnt have happend is getting caught. and one last thing, you dont want me to tell anyone cause YOU'LL feel embarassed, well just for that if i could, id scream it to the world.    dad came in my room @ 4.. saw that i wasnt sleeping, he asked why. i just said i wasnt tired. he kissed me goodbye and left to get on a plane to houston. A.M HOMEROOM: didnt really stay in there we had an assembly ASSEMBLY: 2 hours, stu. co. induction and junior ring tying 1-3: Science Lab- I GOT IN MY FIRST FIGHT AT BLENK!! :o) YAY! not gonna tell the whole story but just to let you know me and jess came out on top w/props from the entire class!!  4-6: Spanish- board work 7-9: PE- badmitton.. we lost twice oh well i didnt really care its just pe anyways 10-12: History- took a test, made a 100 on it. and then talked 13-14: Lunch- just talked about ppl we used to know. it got really sad... 15-17: English- went over a study guide 18-20: skipped, lisa picked me up early.  so here i am at the moment, today was a day that felt like i still had you. but i dont see any progression. but thats just me.. who knows. im gonna go pack cause im leaving for houston tomorrow.   i love you sonny.
