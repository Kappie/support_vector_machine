It was so great seein him run up the stairs and huggin him was awesome. The frist night we went out to dinner at the Marina Cafe. It was lovely. Then he came to my house and we exchanged Christmas gifts. He got me some really nice candles, some perfume, and a bracelet that had some charms on it. I loved it but I couldn't like give him a kiss or anything till later cause his parents and my mom decided to watch us open gifts. I don't think they liked my mom too much for some reason but... any ways. I was showing everyone my bracelet. I love it you have no idea. Then on the second day, I went to practice and then I came home and I had to get ready to go to the city for a 5:30 dinner so we would have time before the play ("Little Shop of Horrors") started. But.. New York City traffic wasn't on my dad and my side so we ended up getting to the restaurant at 6:15 and it was only when we got there did we realize that the play started at 7 and not 8 as we had thought. So, I ate my baked clams and some bread and after a bit we had to go. The play was really good. Very entertaining and the boy next to me and the fact that he was next to me made it all the more better. So, after, we went back to the hotel so Mick could get his things and then my dad had called a car for us back into Staten Island. So one lovely car ride later Mick was at my house! lol. So... then what happened... oh yea... we'll just skip the night time activities cause those are going to be my happy memories. The next morning, we woke up, I made mediocre pancakes (but they were okay, not THAT bad), and then after a little bit me and Mick decided to crash my teams practice for a little while so everyone who wasn't comming to my party could meet him. It was alright, he got to meet the people who make this island a paradise for me. Then, we walked back to my house and again, we will leave those happy memories to me. My party was alright I guess. A speed bump or two but not too bad. I didn't have that much fun at it, I think I had the most fun when me and Mick were just like, I dunno talkin. Cousin Mikey goes "You look like your havin fun." and I was like, "No, not really." and he goes "Well, you're laughin and smiling. It's cause he's here (points at Mickey), isn't it?" and I was like, "Yea." lol. Me and Mick kissed at midnight and I swear after midnight I just wanted ::hem hem:: certain people ::hem hem:: to leave and only my faves to stay. Nah, though, Phil is cool, Marc too. After the party, Cousin Mikey graciously went upstairs and left me and Mick alone. Though there was fun going on, I was really, really upset and sorta started bawling. I couldn't help it! I was missin him already and I still had another full day with him.  We woke up kinda early and then my dad picked us up and brought us to Long Island. Mick met Mario and we had to deal with silly questions like "Are you two in love?" and "Are you going to get married?" and "Do you love him?" and "Do you love her?". He (Mario) is so like intrigued by like teenagers and realtionships and girls body parts its a little urking that hes only 6. lol.  Mick and I spent most of the night in my room upstaris with the door open cause it being closed would have only made people suspicious. More happy memories to reflect on. He got kinda upset about leaving and then like, them leaving kept on being delayed so me and him just kinda started to hang out like normal but I felt like crap cause my stomach was goin crazy and the thought that he was leavin was still in the back of my mind.  We thought up a few alternatives to him leaving. One was to lock ourselves in my bedroom and never come out. One was to stuff me in his duffle bag and take me back with him and I could live in his upstaris and no one would ever know. The third was to just wait out some more months before we will see each other again and then wait till after my senior year for me to come out there for college and stuff. We chose the duffle bag approach but then thought better of it. Airport security might ask some awkward questions if I was found.  Then, he hadda leave. I said bye and thanks to Curt and Gina and then gave him one last hug and kiss and... that was it. My great days were over. I just got so used to wakin up and him bein one door away. But... I'm gonna have to push on I guess. Can't go on all depressed. Alright, talk to you later.  x0x
