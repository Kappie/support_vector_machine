Driving into the neighborhood I saw Dusty, my neighbor's dog, lose and dangerously close to the highway.  The dog never comes when I call it so I kept driving.  When I pulled onto the street I saw Rich, my neighbor, in his truck waiting for Torey to get off the bus.  He went after Dusty and left me to pick up Torey.  So I'm sitting there and the bus pulls up and I get out of the car to get her.  One of the older elementary school boys who lives on my street, I think his name is AJ, sees me and falls to the back.  After all the kids except for Torey run to their parents, he grabs her and goes, "Torey, do you know her? If you don't come home with me, don't ride with strangers."  This from a kid who lives on my street!  I have baby sat him before.  His brother likes to run out and pet Lucky and Pepper, yet I'm a stranger.  I was shocked.  Do I look menacing? Wow...
