I haven't had time lately, last night was the first night in a couple days I've been home. I've spent the last two nights with some people I'm pretty close to. I'm very glad that this weekend is over! And I have almost all the money for my car, and I think I'm going to be getting the one I was talking about earlier. But we'll see. I guess thats all for now. To bad things arn't going to well with everyone. I wish things we're different, but they arn't. And I know its for the best, everyone is telling me it is..and has been telling me that for over a year now...I just never listened. Maybe I'll listen now. Who knows. Everything with other people is going great though! Cept Twinkee, hes getting on my nerves lately. Thats okay though, I think hes just upset with me so hes not caring anymore. Oh well. I'll write later maybe.
