This house doesn't help . i seriously wonder if people give a shit sometimes. YES ur prob reading this like "oh come on! quit complaining!" but yeah. i don't know it's just little things that accumulate. its so weird. my parents dont seem very parental (lol only in themost inconvenient times). i mean, in all honesty, people at school know more about wats goin on with me than ur parents.  yesterday i showed my dad my bio assessment (which i got freaking 94% for) and he just brushed it off in 2 secs like "see when u put work in..." (like i don't normally???). i don't know, its kind of like im just 'here' and i happen to live in the same house lol. ok weird. and now i am getting hassled about getting a job.  G-R-E-A-T.  I DUNNO. i need help. lol. im run down... i'm trying to get rid of this stupid cold but im running around studying, hockey, etc etc...  i need a PARENT not a friend  atm. my mums just... i dont know. but u know how parents do... uh for lack of a better term PARENTAL things, lol. like help with dinner, wash ur clothes (lol), make sure ur not SICK etc. well this is shit. im going to hockey tonight (yeh dont ask me how my shoulder is b4 i go... or if my cold is going away,)AND i get home and have to make dinner. like wtf? i need to study and stuff. they bend over backwards for stupid private school brother ungrateul dickhead. while i cook and clean. yay!
