Kristine, Christina, and I were silly. Welaughed so much. They are awesome!! Screaming and being crazy was fun.Kristine made a funny sand castle. Tina bought a chicken toy. 2. Kiet and I wenttoo far in the ocean. The lifeguard told us to swim back in. I was trying to swim back in, but the current kept pushing me further back.The lifeguard helped me. Now, I can tell my children, I was saved by a lifeguard :-P Kiethad some mad tricks :-D and he can rap! 3. Quyen gave Tony a basketball. He's into photography--- really cool. Tony was funny when he had to change out of his bathing suit. He was a good boy today :-) 4. Chi Jennifer and Peter were nice!! They are good drivers.  ******************************* 5. I got toeat thai food w/my cool cousin Chi Hue and close friend Rachelle. Rachelle is a fun gal and incredible dancer. Chi Hue is so sweet-- gentlemen, she is a good looking woman and has a great personality.  6. Kiet, Hue, and I went shopping. It's been over a year since I went to Big-K. Inexpensive stuff, but I don't recommend the food they sell.  well, I'm exhausted... take care. later
