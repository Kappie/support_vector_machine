In the letter James is sending me (I mean Rames is sending Bo) he included a dead flower with a caption that reads "Unlike this flower, my love for you will last forever" that is the sweetest thing ever!!!  2. I finally have plans!!! Marlee is coming over!!! YIPEE!!!  3. I ranted at Jenny and made some fun whore comments about Geena in Keri's entry about the party Geena and Jenny aren't invited to!!!  4. I took pictures...and I'm hot...haha...I'm so falsly conceited!! And by falsly I mean I am NOT conceited...although really I shoul be...ust look at me!!! I'm just kidding...  5.
