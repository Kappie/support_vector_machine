I don't think I've been in such a bad way for a long time. I just need to breathe, breathe some more and just start spewing out some bullshit. I got an A on the last paper, and a B on the midterm, I can afford a mediocre grade on this thing. It'll be half-assed, but it'll be fine. I just need to chill the fuck out. It's cool, I'm cool, and I can get through this just fine. I just need to establish a plan of action and I can get through it just fine. Whew. I just need to breathe steadily and write, and read it in the morning. I'm fine. I can do this. I've gotten As on papers written in less time and with less preparation than this. It's cool, I can do. Whew. I'm feeling better after my little stream of consciousness self-help talk. Now you know how I'm so calm. I just soothe myself regularly. And breathe deeply. All the time. Also helpful is the slow countdown from 10 to 1, following my heartbeats. Very calming. Okay. Now to write the worst paper ever, but it'll get done, and it'll get turned in on time. That's what counts.
