This is partly about shining the light on your own accomplishments and allowing others to see what you've done. This doesn't mean that you'll need to give up the security of what you already have. You will, however, need to find balance between your home and your professional world.      Yeah, we'll see.        Had a talk with Jefe yesterday. Let's just say we came to an understanding. His understanding is that I am an ungrateful twit sometimes. My understanding is that he is a colossal ass sometimes. Now we can work in harmony.     And I have learned not to speak casually with Barbie about workplace ethics. She told Posh I wasn't feeling "appreciated," and of course, Posh couldn't wait to share that with Jefe, who was pissed because, admittedly, after a lot of the stuff he's done for me over the years, I should be grateful. And I am. But he has a way of making me feel lower than dirt sometimes.      It doesn't say much about my character that I keep coming back for more.
