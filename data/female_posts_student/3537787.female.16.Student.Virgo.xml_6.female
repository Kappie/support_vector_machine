Is it all in your purse? Or am I for all nothing writing this verse?  So trixy and coy, you seem to be Is it seem or a dream, or are you after me?  I asked if there was a problem with my going right in Not thinking I was committing the largest of sin  But the way that you publish and the way that you speak You're jealous it's me, yet pretend to be meek  Well sorry it is, you have some issues to choose Don't worry you'll win out, because I'm starting to lose  I can't keep up with the beauty, I can't match that fame You are a legacy playing this game  You are the queen of hearts and I only the two So why deny me my security in the things that I do?  Why entice my accomplishment, like bait to a fish I'm simply a girl all herself, with a hope, and a wish  You set in paranoia, I can't get it out Outside I embrace you while my peace wants to shout  You'll never even fathom this was written for you For all of the deceptive manipulative things that you do  Maybe it's all in my head and you truly are rare But now you've grabbed some attention, for I am not there  I know that it was you who spoke of being so achingly clad Did you ever wonder that that might make me mad?  Just because I wear a mask doesn't mean I don't have a face It's only that I can't keep up the pace  Did you know I cry too, or know when I'm wrong? Now I've written a novel instead of a song  I think I see through that brick wall you erect The person inside that you want to protect  And if your insides were outside, and your outside was in I would be the one to in the end win  But I'm the girl, the one that has paced That you befriended and betrayed, and now have replaced  I am the only one who ever will know How you really are, how devishly low  But now I must end before I will start For unlike you, I do, inside have a heart
