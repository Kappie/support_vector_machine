I bet i missed out all the fun.. and bonding too.      Hee... But i get to bond with Han.. So maybe that's not really that bad after all.. Luckily he came to see me.. Or else.. I wouldn't want to cope up at home alone on such a wonderful day..      Hmm.. Ok, I need people to act my school project very desperately!! By this saturday!! Anyone interested please e-mail me ok? Thank you very very very much! =D      Ok now... Why the above title? I don't how to say or explain.. But you could say i'm being paranoid or sensitive again. Hmm.. I also don't know.. I guessed i'm feeling too emotional to say anything.. Hey people, If you think this blog is very boring tell me or post me a message ok? I'll try to squeeze EVERY BIT OF LIFE i can find on me. Though i doubt it lah.. Wahahahaha...(-_-)'' I'm becoming nuts..      How do you define "lame" and "funny"? Actually there's a very thin line between these 2 words. Hmm.. Maybe I should check the dictionary. Han told me that if the next time people call me lame, I should say,"  I'm not lame! See, I'm walking perfectly !" Hee.. I wouldn't want to try this, But i'll be very interested in what the other party will say! =9      Ok... Hope I'll feel better tomorrow.. I'm really feeling miserable now, and i just ate another big bowl of porridge just now! Ah... I'm bound to have indigestion tomorrow again.. See.. Me and my big fat mouth.. Take care everyone! Gd nite..        Yeah!!!!!! S.H.E!!!!!!! (=^-^=)v
