It's absolutely hilarious... and it's full of surprises but I won't give those away. ;) Anyway, that's all I'll say about it because what else can you really say about something like this? It's fucking great. Go see it.   I realized something today. Galahad... in King Arthur... my favorite... is played by Hugh Dancy... one of my favorite actors... and I didn't even know. How stupid could I have been? I didn't recognize him! Look:      Both of him! But to me, looks like two different people. Gah! Oh well, now that I KNOW, I see it... but I didn't see it in the movie. Jesus. I like him so much though. =)   Um, that's all for now I suppose. I start work tomorrow... I haven't even started and I'm already kind of dreading it but at least I can listen to music all day and I'll make some money. Hooray.
