And sure enough, it was a very very important entry.  Full of wonder and shocking twists.  Really.  It was.  I was typing along, writing about my day back home, full of detail and fluff.  Was getting around to my plants, reliving the stories of their namings when Lorraine IMed me.  The rest of the entry summarized that non-conversation and the torment that went along with it.  Just finished spell-checking my entry for the final time and was IMed by a stranger.  Decided to check out the profile of said stranger and was faced with a "save entry" question and I, unwittingly, clicked "cancel" just before I realized what that meant.    I'll gather myself and try again.  Deep inhalation, and:  Ahhh home again.  (That's really how the first one started, I remember that much.)  Made it in 9 hours.  Slept late this morning and made a real breakfast.  Yay.  Finally got around to putting up new art work and repairing old this afternoon.  Running a fan all night to mask the sounds of neighbors and highway isn't all that conducive to long-lasting adhesive devices.  Did some Property reading for tomorrow, but never got around to doing the practice exam; maybe it'll get done tomorrow.  But it's World AIDS Day tomorrow and I'm supervising the mircophone hook-up process in the courtroom, heavy responsibility.  See the Property practice exam moving to Wednesday.  Maybe I just won't take the final at all.  Listened to Tori's Collection while puttering and it's really not that bad.  They are all improvements, and good ones at that!  Suppose it won't be banished to the CD shelf (graveyard) just yet.   The plants made it through their week alone.  They were pretty dry and gasping for breath when I returned, but they perked right up after a shot of vodka each.  They're spider plants and the first living things I've ever cared for.  Now I've got to hook up to AC power before my battery goes dead and I lose a 2nd post.  There.  So yea, Levi brought the first plant from Oregon over the summer.  Came home from work one day to find my Shakespeare anthology on the table. "You name the plant?" "Yup....Calphurnia." "Calphurnia?!" "That's right." "Okay." Related the story to Lorraine that night and she replied: "Ahhh, Caesar's wife." There'd been a TNT original movie on that night about the man.  One rarely gets a better set up than that.  She'd just IMed me as I finished that story the first time.  She wanted to visit, to see how I'm doing, to make sure I'm okay.  She was afraid, during my time to think and reflect, I'd decided to hate her and forged regret, which has always been her greatest fear.  I sounded very detached and harsh when I wrote back that I didn't hate her, I have no regrets and we weren't going to chat about anything.  It was very weird.  And Dido started singing about her White Flag in the middle of it.  Over the course of the rest of the entry, in which I described the birth and naming of Calphurnia's daughter, Trudi, Lorraine asked whether she could still call if it was critical that she speak to me.  Not tonight; just for future reference.  Kept thinking about her forwarded email and what a shit I felt like for not sending a one-line reply, similar to the one-line responses I gave her tonight.  I'd planned to type about her originally, but clearly hadn't expected what actually happened.  Been wondering about all the Lorraine-related stuff I've got around and trying to decide whether to put it all way for the duration.  Like her old shirt I still sleep in, for example.  Any thoughts, dear readers?  I don't have a shrine, but there's a fair amount of innocent little things around.  Should it all disappear, for a bit at least?    She kept typing a message and stopping.  That's one of my favorite features on IM.  Just as I was finishing the entry and getting ready to start spell checking it, she sent a final message and signed her name.    And that's how it really happened.  This entry's not as good as the original, but it'll do.
