Yet, in flipping through the Fall 2002 issue of the  St. John's Law Review , and there he was:  Godric C. Shoesmith.  So I  urlLink Googled him , knowing that this is such an unusual name that I was bound to come up with the right guy.  Looks like he works for Simpson Thacher  Bartlett now.  Wish he could get me a job...with his cool name and all.
