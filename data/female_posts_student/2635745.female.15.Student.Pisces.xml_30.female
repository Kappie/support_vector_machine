That is besides the loss of power and the being smacked in the nose by Sarah which wasn't as bad as when she clutched my head to her chest so I couldn't breath and then Chelsea trying to shove a tissue up my nose for fear that is was bleeding.  It was pretty funny.  Well, anyhwo I'm sorry I couldn't make it last night to the Miss Guardian Angel Pageant.  But for now I must get well for Districts are on Friday and I can not miss school for rehearsals and whatnot.  I will see you all later.
