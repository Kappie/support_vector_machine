I finally met my sister's boyfriend.  he seems like a nice guy, maybe a little shy or quiet.  Yawn...  tomarrow is the start of my last week being a Junior, next year I will be a senior!!!!  I am way excited.  I would be even more excited if my best friend could share this year with me, but sadly, she graduated today and will be off at exciting college.  :o(  well, my coach told all us going-to-be-senior-girls that captain picking will be done at camp, not at the end of summer.  I am nervous, I really want to be captain.  Sigh.... well I've got to go and finish my project "should men get maternity leave?",  Hasta La Vista (however you spell it),     katie
