I'll just list the events in point form: -Met at this park, Ashley and Michelle got there at 5:15. -Went to the creepy Select store and got some drinks. I got a peach/mango Sobe. yummy -Went to my house, played Siren. Thanks to Ashley, I am on the second level. Aww thanks Ashley.  -Then we played Halo. lmao. It was fun running each other over on vehicles. I was about to snipe Ashley on my sniper and she runs in a zig zag. lmao -Went outside, and to the park near the swimming pool. -These sprinklers started gushing out water. They were so big and high up.   -Lmao, Me and Ashley found out that you could move the direction of where the water comes out. I sprayed a little girl. lmao. Then, lmao, I sprayed Ashley, and her hair flew up!! LMAO.. It was funny. Then after that. Ashley wanted revenge, so her and Michelle grabbed me and yea..lol. We were both soaked except for Michelle.  -Then we start to walk back, and we find a baseball bat. Lmao, I throw this rock and Michelle hits it and it was like 3 inches from hitting this truck!!! Lol, I would've ran.  -Then Ashley and Michelle were nice enough to walk me home. Aww..  -I got home at 10:25, and now I am typing this entry again. yep. STUPID IE!   I'm thinking of playing GTA - Vice City. I'm trying to complete the game again since my old file got deleted. I own the mansion now so, It'll probably take 3-4 more days til I complete the whole thing. Well, it depends on how much I play it. Gosh. I'm going to my moms stampede breakfast thingy tomorrow. Ahhh. I have to wake up pretty early. After that, I'm going to millenium park. Its going to be really intimidating/awkward. If my mom wouldn't be watching me then It would be that wierd. Because, If I do a trick or something, she'll be like, "Oh no! Thats dangerous" and stuff like that, and then I wouldn't be allowed to do tricks anymore. sucky. Yep. Home Movies is on. Fin.
