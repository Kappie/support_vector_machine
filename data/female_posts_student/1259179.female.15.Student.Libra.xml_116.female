We went out to eat at  Pearls Lakeside  on Lake Hefner. I havent been really eating much lately so I got a salad and  TRIED A CLAM  sick!! the slimy stuff looks so  interesting.  I kept asking dad what the slimy stuff would be if it was alive but he wouldnt really explain really well so I was like whatever. Jenna is eight and likes everything accept for pizza!! she is quite a character and I love her so much. This is my 3rd time only to see her though sadly. I missed her growing up. When I was eight I saw her when she was only one and I saw her last aug when she was seven and now this aug when she was eight. I really wished I was there when she was gorwing up a bit because before I know it she will be my age because time is moving quickly now and its not gonna stop anytime soon.  My dad's fioncee, becki did not come because if she did, then mom would not because she thinks its not "appropriate". And its moms side thats here so I really wanted her to be here but i wanted becki to be here to meet them too. Its not fair and it makes me so mad.  Then it got emotional. I was actually happy to all be together, but I was also sad at the same time. My mom and dad were there! together like nothing happened; like they werent even divorced. It made me so sad to think that even though we are all family, as a whole we really arent. after dinner I asked my dad to take me onto the lake to see the sunset.  It was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life. I wish life itself was that beautiful..I wish it was all happiness..the colors, everything about it makes me happy. I want a boat so I can just sail away on lake hefner. I saw ducks too. it was nice. When me and my dad were out there he asked me what I thought and I said it was kind of weird and he asked me how so and before i told him i told him i would cry and i completely broke down and told him i wish sometimes him and mom were back together and he told me he was sorry and said some other things that i dont quite remmeber. I was so nervous for tonight because my mom was having family problems in the passed and i was so upset and stressed i had breathing problems and i got my period all over again. GRRR!!!!!!  Well tomorrow is my sisters wedding at 10 am. It will be exciting although i will probably have some axiety attack because walking down an isle with people watching kind of freaks me out. but I guess we will see how it goes. hmph.  my family leaves sunday back to new jersey. I will miss them but I hope my real side will come out of me these last few days with them because i just feel so guilty and sad that i have been sad but i cant really help it sometimes. I just want someone to understand me and wont get upset and be like "god she always crys and is sad".
