Serious, must have been Wednesday night... which is 5 days ago. Well, absolutely long for me la.   Haih…its all I can see. Now now, don't misunderstand, that sigh is not a sigh of depression or whatever but of relief, reflection and amazement. Seriously this past week has been like w h o a.  Went for The Edge conference in FGA KL, a creative arts conference and then I left for church camp on Friday and came back roughly 4 hours ago. So killer. Mainly the conference was the highlight since the camp was kinda like a hangover from conference sorta thing. Haha I didn't even give my full attention to Ps John Kwan, the speaker at camp. It was sorta based on Rick Warren's book the Purpose Driven Church.. like telling how to grow your church and bring the community to your group of core ministers. Hmm.. suitable for youth anot, you tell me. I told my dad and he told me to write to Ps John Kwan, tell him that it was supposed to be a family camp and that he should have prepared his sessions and include the youth. Hmmmm..  nah, its okay. I don't really err like giving pastors my opinions or anything cos MOST (most only, there’s still a small portion left) of em probly like alamak this fella thinks she is who.... But I dunno I believe in letting those below you (so to speak) to correct you. But hmm, I didn't plan to preach here and I will not preach here.  Its 12.30 now and the rain drops are beating against the awning outside.. Ahh, so peaceful. Oh, and Hoobastank's The Reason has been playing since I turned on the comp. On repeat. Very lovely song there, I always seem to like a song then listen to it till I'm sick of it and move on. Hmm.   The people online are boring. Strange I used to be so excited seeing them online. They just seem so boring. Or maybe its me. Yeah its me. I know its me cos I can feel the vibes. Oh don't ask me how, you do not wanna know. Well maybe they're not boring, its just I dunno what to say, tiredness of the brain, most probably. But hey, they're keeping silent too, not exactly fair for me ritey-o?  Hey, M-R! get on with life la.   Ok ok, getting on. Yeah anyway, back to the conference. It was just eye-opening. I figure you're visiting this blog cos you wanna know bout my progress, degress, emotions and you’re just bored. Whatever it is, get ready for confessions. *gasps*   Yes, ok, before the conference started, I never prepared myself. No, didn't even talk to God the night before, in fact, I slept with the light on trying to do dunno what la. Then came the morning session they had worship. Goodness I felt out of place *guilty*. Was like, oh no, so long have not talked to Him and suddenly you come in here in praise Him? Yes, Tuesday morning. Oh btw, Ps Dennis Balan preached a great message. Too bad I've heard before. Conference that day was great. My first 2 workshops were 'Reaching the fringe music culture'. No one from my group were there. Everybody else was in the worship leading workshop. Even those who don't worship lead. Hmm.. Anyways, I had to go alone, it was fine. Just I felt a lil out of place with all the youth leaders and there were so many ppl. I dunno bout you, but when I do not know anybody and everyone is grabbing chair sitting down in a place where the space is getting filled up quickly, I honestly feel insecure. God may be good to me, but its just a feeling when everyone is has a seat and Oh no! I don’t have a chair. *scratches head* Weird, eh? Anyways, the workshop was good, I learned a lot. Ps Glenn Lim was taking the workshops. And although, the things he taught weren't directly applicable to me cos I wasn’t like doing any ministry in the fringe area, but I learned much which yeah I can use in the future. And now I know how to reach out to them.   Then during lunch everyone asked how my workshop was, I told em 'good' and wah suddenly everyone follows me to the part 2. (actually 3 others only la) hehe. But I kinda learned more during part 1 I gotta say. Before class ended, Ps Glenn arranged another session for Q  A since he didn't have enough time. Alrightey! More =) The next day, Ps Glenn took the morning session. It was very very relevant to me. Well, yeahla, some of it he had told the class the day before, but still it got to me again. Oh yeah, Ps Glenn reminds me of dad. I absolutely do not know why you know!! Its like they're not of the same age, diff generation altogether, they work with the diff ppl, diff nationalities, dad isn't a changed ex-druggie, and I dunno.. very far apart. But somehow I dunno leh, maybe it's the way Ps Glenn preaches and prays that reminds me of dad. Strange though, cos no one has ever reminded me of dad, the way he thinks, they way he presents his sermons and the way he relates. But whoa, of all ppl, a young Singaporean pastor barely across his mid thirties (I think).. Hmm.. Very strange. I still can believe it myself.   LOL. Call me perasan, proud, arrogant, snobbish, prejudice whatever… but I admire my dad very very much, as a preacher/teacher. And woohoo, Ps Glenn reminds me of my dad. Hah. I think dad's jealous. I told him on Wednesday night. ;) Nah, I'm joking. But really lor, I find it sooo amusing. But its good, shows I'm not prejudice, cos if I was, no one would remind of dad.   Lalalalalaa, getting sleepy. I got a lot more to tell but the screen itself looks like funny now and I hear the stars calling me (or rather its only Jars of Clay hehe) to slumberland. Goodnightey everybody, anybody, nobody who is reading this.   -Mary-RuthLowErn-Lyn
