It's nice to be dry and warm at times. If we had the seadoos anyways we wouldn't have even been out on them yet. M's boat is nice. Really nice. And I had fun, which is always good. I miss that. It doesn't happen that often anymore. I wonder why that is. Life is what you make of it, so maybe it's just me. Hmmm. Interesting. Very interesting. I miss Sara. I can't wait until she comes home. But then I keep thinking of how different next year is going to be, and everyone who will be gone, and how much I will miss everyone. I'll still see them though, no one is going to stop me. That will be my mission. Mission Unstoppable. haha like the movie, only not. really not.  heigh ho heigh ho  to the pool again i go watch the kids come down the slide get hit on by lots of guys heigh ho heigh ho..  i like the beach. it has to be hot though. i think florida is the best for that. one year ago right now.. hmmm. nice.
