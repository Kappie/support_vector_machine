She hops up and down upon the earth. She wants to find a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow!  Next verse words end like this: rainbow play earth love harps Texas  Next verse after that is like this: Texas rainbow harps play love earth  Next verse is this: earth Texas love rainbow play harps  Tercet can vary: rainbow, Texas, harps  (or rainbow, play, harps) on the outside and inside earth, Texas, and love.  Well, if anyone has any ideas--just let me know. Otherwise, I will figure this out tomorrow or another day! :)
