I would write odes to F train, washington square park, union square. I thought I was soooo dope. Anyway now that I'm back living in the (Technically) Lower East Side i pass by Forbidden Planet all the time. For those that don't know it's a comic book store. I was browsing through some h.s. memories, the role playing games (yes i DID play a short stint of VAMPIRE but shhhh) but I ran across my new favorite comic......AQUAMAN! he is soooooo dope! I don't know what it is about him but I'm about to go pick up the next issue oh and Catwoman. She's stepped into the 20th century and she's a lesbian. I mean it makes sense.....being a lesbian save for that one special man who can wear rubber and a cape and still make it look sexy?
