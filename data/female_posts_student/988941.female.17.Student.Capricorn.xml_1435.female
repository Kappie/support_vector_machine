Anyhow, 2 x £1.58 has been charged to my bank account without me saying so......contacting the bank on Tuesday to sort it out.  As for A-Levels, I am sticking to what I did last year. I will probably take General Studies A2. Might as well, 3 lessons a fortnight and a whole A2 for it. General Studies does suck though...but I think I can tolerate it for another year.  Fathers Day Sunday.........what have we all got em'? I haven't purchased anything yet, but i'll give him a massive bar of Cadburys choc and a new shirt (as his old one is all worn round the collar).
