Trust him to spill his whole drink over me. Then I put my foot in it so my plaster smells of beer to! Eugh! Any way, piano was fun! If you can call playing the piano fun! I'm playing Arietta or whatever it is for one of my grade four pieces and it's hard! It's only one piece and this is a major, not even short breaths piece! (Oh a breath in piece is where you can actually stop for a minute! Aaargh! But it sounds good and it's fun so it's worth it! Hmm... I think by the end of tomorrow I might need some beer, my brother's gonna have super soakers! (EEEK!) Hehe... I'll just scream and run, we've gone through this before haven't we? Hmm... maybe the beer fumes are affecting me... maybe it's just me...
