We all have got mobiles, mine is clinincly attached to me. v. fine in situations when you actually need it, or when you have not substituted all reason with a taaaad bit of beer...   So making a long story a bit shorter... The day started with a trip to RUC... evaluation of the semester. Yes we do actually work at out there once in a while, picked up our pretty, wonderful, and absolutely fab project! Well done girlies!! Think we managed to twist our way out of doing the BS history notes... dan charlie, dan charlie what _were_ you thinking?!?  The previous-mentioned surprise, had absolute dickely duckely nothing to do with me, but congratz on the new toy Mus! Be careful and dont break ur neck ;)Guess i might get a sneak peak today...  Talked with sweet Chris, it was nice he's on his way to becoming famous, cant wait to see the film ;) Nor can i wait until he move his pretty little behind over here!   Had peachy dinner with Dee, and then got ready to meet Joey-- So got to studenterhuset and had several beers... Joey and I were talking bout embarrasing things... And good ol' stories! Went on to cosy... And by then I had started SMS'ing "things" to B.. (the potential new)... ohhh dear, somebody plz shoot me! Should really not say things like that to someone who doesnt know you... imagine the worst u can say x5 then you have what I told him ;/ Well it gets worse... have never talked to this guy, phone acts up... so i decide through my beer goggles that the most rational would be to call him. 2am, am in the middle of a noisy gay bar, and cant even get two words straight (okay not to get things straight in a gaybar) but this was calling New B. Well the first words are kinda like: ssshellow shhhow are uuuuuu doing... where to he replies: you are drunk!   Well partied on til Joey v. casually draaagged me home... ;) thanx hubby u r a doll :D Have woken up feeling semi quasi okay, have group meeting in the city...  Walk out in a g-string thing making coffee... standing there in my own pretty little world... ass on full display... Old friend Rasmus from Gymnasium walks out off dee's room, and greets morning... how to begin the day :/ Top dollar class!  Does anyone have an asprin?
