Haven't colored it yet because I don't know what colors she is (hint hint Sekora..) ^^ The only thing that makes me angry about it is the fact that when I inked it with my crappy cheap pens, the staff got messed up.. but I can fix that when I color it using Photoshop. So, overall.. not horrible.   urlLink Dalisedeni  My fan-made character from the musical CATS, looking rather cute and HAPPY. Deni's a rather HAPPY type of person... cat... Jellicle.. uh, whatever. The main point is that she's HAPPY. Only thing I don't like about this picture is the hand she has balled into a fist, it's just.. uh.. fingers = way screwed up. An' I was trying to make it look like she was holding her arm out straight toward the hypothetical camera. But, uh.. doesn't look like that worked. Either way, though, Deni is HAPPY!!!  ^_____________________^
