There's something that I find so... blah but you know what? Whatever. Don't wanna talk about it.   I forgot that I had to send the thing to Brian! Haha! Forgot. Bleh, whatever, I'll send him this instead. ^^ By the way Brian, it's all gone! ^^ No more! They go POOF! Hehe~  Still playing with my blunt blunt knife. You know what? I'm gonna attempt writing a  deeper  song for the contest. Iunno... we don't have a lot of time left. Next Friday is the deadline. Let's go, people! More band practises needed!  Well, I'm off to practise. See y'all laters.
