For every mistake I put on this page tonight, I need a really good spanking. Here I am kinna tippsy and ready to dance alone in my living room. Its funny tho by just trying to picture myself dancing. Its so boring to be home alone with nothing to do nor anything to watch on tv. Very boring. I dont know how peopel can do this but I dont think its relaxing at all.  Weekend really sucks!!! Went to the mall didnt get shit. Play tennis for a very good hour and found 11 tennis balls. That was awesome dude!!! Went to dinner with a very good friend. His so funny.   I'm buzzin an its boring dammit. I'm listening to trance and I'm in the mood of dancing. Anybody care to join me? But heres something I would like to share.
