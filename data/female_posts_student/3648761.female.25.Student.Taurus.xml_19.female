Carl, really wants me to go to Florida to visit Christine. He makes it sound like he is doing it for me. But i know he just offered to pay for my trip so that He can also go on vacation to Maine to go bear hunting. Unfortunately the dates he wants to go are 3 days before school starts. I am not going to do anything to jeopardize my first couple days of school. Yesterday, my sister and I went swimming at Ottawa Lake. I had a good time. I was super hung over , and my sister was drinking. Man was she annoying. I wasn't in the moood to babysit her ass. She kept messing with me, pointing at me and siting a couple of inches from me, saying"I'm not touching you". She did this for like 20 minutes. She kept saying "how do you like it". Because I guess back when were kids I use to do this. Which is probably true, but that was when I was 6-8 years old. My sister is 29 years old. I think she should have just let it go by now. ( I beleive that Sunny D commercial brought back old memories) Anway the point is, she really annoyed me. We would up fighting like when we were kids, punching and kicking, and pulling my hair. That bitch. We made some dinner and watched a movie together last night. I love my sister, she is my best friend, but I really wasn't in the mood for drunkness, after I was already carrying a hang over since Thursday. Christine is still in town untill Tuesday. I will post some pictures from our weekend, later this week.
