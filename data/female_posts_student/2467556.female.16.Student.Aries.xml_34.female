And then they were all talking about how great he was.....it was awesome.  i was so proud of him!!!  And his hair looked beautiful and blonde as usual.  Except now i'm confused on the colors of his eyes.  Me and Brittany debated on this before we left for the Coppell Hockey game.  They're supposed to be blue but i think they're actually more of a grey or blue-grey.  And when they did a close up on his face, they were grey but from far away they look blue.  So confusing.  Meh, Stars still suck but Niko rocks.  yay.  Tonight we play Calgary and i think we'll win this one, but lose our next 6 and then win our next 3.  Those are my predictions.  Go Stars.  Coppell played Highland park also on Thursday and i have to admit it was a much more intense game than i expected.  Last year, Coppell would beat HP 6-2 every game.  And now all of the sudden HP had a chance.  They got close, but we were one step ahead of them.  Cowboys played pretty well, there were a few passing problems and a few unfair penalties from the refs.....but thats the usual.  Some brilliant hits from Ashcon, Jimmy M., and Adam Havens.  At least i think it was them.  I don't really know because Brittnee's so tall and she was in my way for most of the night, lol its ok Brittnee i still love you!  My friend from HP, Emily, who i know from the Stars games, came and we had alot of fun.  She really hit it off with Brittany and Jess because all 4 of us are hockey fanatics and all.  George Lesner had to be the gay bastard he is and make fun of Emily because she was from Highland Park.  he was just saying crap to her and it really got on my nerves.  But its ok, the Brittanys, Jessica and I got onto his case about it and he shutup.  Agh, how much i hate him and his gay un-color coordinated clothes.  Susan was also getting on my nerves because she kept on giving me her "dissapproving looks" when i was cheering for the team.  And Emily Drinkwater was being more loud than i was and was flicking off everything that walked.....mad props to Emily D., her antics were very amusing.  AAgh, if you don't like hockey and you don't like people cheering/supporting the team, then don't frickin come.....we don't want you there anyways.    After the hockey game, i went to Brittany's house with Jess and we spent the night.  It was fun and we actually went to bed rather early (2am) considering that we usually go to bed at like 4am.  And i didn't sleep past 12 for once, i got up at around 9:30 - 10.  Weird.  Then we laid on Brittany's bed for about 2 hours singing really loud to All-American Rejects and other songs that were on the cd.  We went to PetsMart and bought stuff for Britty's horse and then we went to Souper Salad to eat healthy.  Then we decided to come to my house and watch Coupling, this absolutely brilliant British comedy that i have on DVD.  We talked to people that were online for about an hour and then we watched the entire first season and half of the second before we passed out on the floor from sleep.  i don't even remember half of the jokes we made, i think i got amnesia from........i don't remember.  But yeah, they were funny when we made them.  Brittany had to leave at the crack of dawn (9am) and Jess and I decided to lay there for about an hour and not be able to understand each other's english.  After Jess went home (after playing about 30 rounds of BopIt, lol), i went to another friend's house and worked on/finished a project.  Yay, now i'm homework free.  Oh yeah, me, Jess, and Britty decided that we're going to do a rotation of houses this weekend.  Our last stop is Jess'.  That's the one where we take pictures.  And then ONE MORE WEEK UNTIL OUR STARS GAME TOGETHER!!!!!  We've already decided that the day we go (which lucky for us is the day we get out for an AC/DEC competition, which my dear Sarah Casey will be performing in, GO SARAH!!!!!) we're going to come to my house, make signs before the game, and then they'll sleepover.  yay.    I'm tired of writing, ttyl!  Go Niko and maybe the Stars, ~~~Taylor~~~
