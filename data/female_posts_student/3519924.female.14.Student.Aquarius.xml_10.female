So, let's just say I hate the world and we all need to die...a lot. All of these jocks and preps need to die a very painful death. I'm in the middle of trying not to talk shit about people or judge anyone, none the less. It's not easy and no fun at all. Aaaand my math teacher is about to lean over my shoulder so bbs.
