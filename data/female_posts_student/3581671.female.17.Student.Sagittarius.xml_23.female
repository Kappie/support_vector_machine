Sam is coming over and we're going to make tee-shirts for the x-c girl that say 'fast girls have good time'!  double meaning eh?!  Boy I am tired when I run.  I got my iron tested again and it's still really low :o( My mum has tomorrow off and I think we might go shopping!  Yes I really want to go to Old Navy.  Gotta go and be creative!  Go and VERB!      katie
