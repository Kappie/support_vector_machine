I highly recommend the Chin Chin Sandwich.. I know it sounds weird, but it is good. Then I came over to Emily's. We played this one game forever! It was so fun.. the object of the game is to get laid. hehe. FUN! I passed out around 5.. i couldn't get to bed case EMILY was tlaking in her sleep.. for a while i thought she was talking to me. Today we just tanned and hung out. Now we are gunna go and see White Chicks.. can't wait.   I MISS YOU JENNIFER! lol
