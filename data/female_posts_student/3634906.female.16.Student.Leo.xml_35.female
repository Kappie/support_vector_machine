I feel asleep around 3 but it wasnt a very sound sleep, i kept twitching and wake up and random moments. Then I woke up at 7:22 and it was hot as hell in my house and i needed to go to the bathroom. I went back to sleep, having a weird weird dream and jumped around. Woke up at 10:00 and then i napped until 12:30 because i felt like shit. I seem to always get really sick when im PMS-ing, as some say. Oh well. I ended up calling james and we wanted to go to a movie but then decided that there wasnt a good one playing and we went through many random options that either got vetoed or werent possible. so we ran to beaver dam and i got some hair dye. And now my hair is BLACK!!! YAY... i did it all by myself so it was a little messy and i even got it on my leg. HAHA... next time i will be better. It actually looks really good and i even took the time to blowdry it. well i am going to go and watch tv or play zelda. See ya -gabby
