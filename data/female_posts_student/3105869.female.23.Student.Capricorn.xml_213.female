My flight leaves out of Munich and into (drumroll) HEATHROW, one of the Al-Qaeda (however you spell it) targets.  Beautiful.  You see, last time Heathrow was under such an alert they shut down the flights to the states, and drumroll my flight from HEATHROW has a layover in CHICAGO, why may you ask is Chicago bad, besides helluva outta the way, because CHICAGO is another target.  This is great and I thought I had suffered heart damage having to maintain eye contact while smiling with Justice O'Connor.  All I gotta say is I hope the massive amount of self-drugging I am about to do on Sunday, doesn't kick in until I am actually on the plane.   Am I some mean bitch with bad karma or did I just draw the short stick this week?
