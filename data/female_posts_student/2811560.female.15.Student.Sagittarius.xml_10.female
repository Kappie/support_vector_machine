Hehe. Anyways, there was actually one thing that sort of pissed me off today. So I'm walking to Spanish and Greg Abell pulls me aside and he was like " Yeah, we don't really...uh...post on the BOA forums".  And then the bell rang, making me late, so we didn't get a chance to talk anymore. The reason he said this was because I had posted a reply to someone who had posted about our director situation. And it wasn't even bad or anything, its not like I said anything anyone wouldn't find out from someone else. I've posted on the forums before and no one has ever said anything. What really makes me angry is that Greg HAS posted on the forums, and has no right to tell me not to. And seriously....there was nothing inappropriate or stupid that I said. So, in two words: Fuck off. Anywho, I went to One Acts today for the first time in a week or so because they told me that they would have blocked up to my enterance. NOT! They decided to start from the beginning again! Thanks, guys. It didn't really matter, though, because I just read someone else's part that wasn't there. And theres this super duper cute guy in the play thats real nice. And he's in a band! Say no more! He plays piano, too. He's sorta got that punk thing goin on, too. Not goth, but punk. Very sexy. So we were all talking about my song, and how I'm playing piano and stuff and he looked me right in the eye and said "That's going to be really cool." Oh my goodness, I almost melted! Lol, it was really nice. So yeah, I've sort of decided this whole thespian thing probably isn't happening this year. I'm just too lazy to do set construction right now. Whatever. Hopefully tomorrow will be as good as today!
