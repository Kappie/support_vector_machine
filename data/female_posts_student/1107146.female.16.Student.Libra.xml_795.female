'Tis a good phrase, that T-shirt is hilarious, if I wouldn't get pinned for being a total faggot I would probably buy and wear. MxPx has another good one along those lines, but it's more male-oriented, some girl pulling some dude's heart out...like, literally. It sounds gross but it just looks hilarious.  Why won't guys talk? I don't know. Do all girls want to listen? It's really a matter of some guys are different than others, some guys have learned or have been taught differently over time. Some guys just can't stand to hear themselves say it, because it just sounds really self-defeating and repetetive...I would tag any communication problems with that one there. Generally, we hate doing it because it means facing things we don't want to see, and going places we really don't want to go, and even if it's about facing them with someone you love and trust, we fear the depression that comes inevitably, we don't want to bring that on these people that we care about.  It's a really difficult thing, and honestly it runs a lot deeper than I know, and I live in it. But still...it's something I can more feel and outwardly talk about than to actually explain the schematics of it. Maybe he will come around, and maybe he won't. And maybe you'll get so fed up one day, that you'll tell him to talk and he will. Or maybe, it'll be the end of the both of you. Yes, it's back to those horrible concepts: time and patience. Things really just don't unfold like a picnic blanket most of the time...Abby and I did a lot of talking before we started going out, so it might have seemed like some instantaneous process, but it was a project in the works for some time. With you and Rob, you already have the relationship deal going, so you're trying to be the best you can for each other, and unfortuantely, that means putting up a lot of walls because you fear judgment. It's great that you all are going out, I think it could be fabulous for the both of you, but really, someone needs to open up here. Had we known things were going to work out this way from the beginning I would have said yeah, give it a couple of weeks before we decide to get things going...but it hardly works out that way, and didn't. So it comes down to, A. giving it time, or B. doing it yourself. Either of these have their strengths and fallibilities that I'm pretty sure you've already diagnosed or have known for some time now, mostly because we've talked about these before.  But again, the choice is yours. It's like the Matrix, man, "I can only show you the door; you have to step through it." It's dumb and over-noble souding to quote movies and all, but that one is to a tea. It's your reins to grab, here; or, to let go...but it's all as you see fit.
