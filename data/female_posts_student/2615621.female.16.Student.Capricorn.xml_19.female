All his stats are about her, even if they are stupid, and she is all he talks about. We talked about her tonite, i was even shown a pic of her..shes pretty...prettier than me. The strange thing is though, they've never met in person. But they are going to the movies tomorrow nite. Luckly, i too have plans with a guy this weekend, so i was sure to tell him about my plans. During our conversation about miss mandy he stops it and asks if im still mad or dissappointed at him. He said that he was just wondering because things felt the way they used to between us. Use to..wow...used to...lets see, we we've been through many stages, so which used to is he talkin about? used to as in when we first met and he was a honry jackass? used to as when we got to know each other and began talking about serious things? used to as when he was depressed and i was there for him every nite to talk to? used to as when i liked him and he was a dick to me? used to...used to can mean so much, so i wouldnt advise using it. I know know what he meant, he meant as in before i was upset, as in before when we were good friends and nothing was wrong with the world when we talked. He didnt have to clarify which "used to", i just knew. I'm actually glad he found some chick he thinks hes crazy about, but it's asking too much when he tells me he would like us all to hang out. Yeah..that means me meeting miss mandy. I couldnt do that, it would just be too weird. Jordan knows that...but then again, i am his friend and he would want me to meet his gf, just like i would want him to meet my bf (if i even freakin had one), but that would just be to prove im not a total actionless loser..which i am...lol This may sound real stupid, but i just want someone that i can sit down with and he run his fingers through my hair...i look at katie and andrew, and andrew is always rubbing her back or playing with her hair..just that sense of sercurity that i know i have someone right there, so close i can feel the. yeah call me a freak, but it doesnt hurt to spend all ur time that a bf should take up thinkin about what you would do with ur bf, if u had one. It's prob more safe, you cant get pregant. Well, i guess i better go to bed just incase it doesnt snow..im already looking at 5 hours of sleep. lol nite!
