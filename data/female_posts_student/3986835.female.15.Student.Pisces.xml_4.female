And it still feels like this is just beginning       But it's already time to let go              Chorus: And I can feel the tingling as I break down        It's time to say good-bye        But we always will remember        And forever we will last        Until the dust has blown away        And there's a new beginning        And the world will start a new....it starts with you        It starts with you              I once told you that I would always be there       But now I have to let go       I've had nothing to say or do except to       Sing this song for you              Chorus              Now it's time to leave but it's never over       No matter what befalls       And we'll outlast all that we've come to know       And we'll understand good-bye              And forever we will last       Until the dust has blown away       And there's a new beginning and the world will start a new       It starts with you, it starts with you       It starts with you, it starts with you           Yeah, that's one of the many songs our "Band Leader" Eric wrote. But this one's my favorite.
