He showed up every once in a while. Emily and I weren't drawing attention to ourselves by twirling like our goofy selves. He was just drawn to our presense lol. Wow he's hott. And then Abbye told me that he hates Karen, our choreographer/assistant director who wishes she ruled the world cuz EVERYTHING'S ABOUT HER!!! ick. Ryan referred to Karen as the Bitch on Wheels. It was HILARIOUS! And it made him even hotter lol. So we made up our own code for when she's pissin us off w/ the help of Hottie Hott. SoOoOoOo...he's gonna b there on FRIDAY. Not THURSDAY. Until then, u should check out Betsy's car, Chingada Suave. It's awesome lol.
