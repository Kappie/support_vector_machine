I hope to meet many new people, make really good friends and have an amazing time. The weekend sounds fun, I mean I only read the packet they gave me but from that it sounds AWESOME. I am going to learn so much! Ok I am exhausted now, and I have to get up VERY VERY VERY early tomorrow morning so I should probably head off to bed like NOW! Ok well anyone reading this tonight Good Luck on your English Final tomorrow. And good luck with all your other finals and regents you have to take! I'll talk to you all sunday night!!!!
