The first half was crazy, Mike was being a dick, and Heather was stuck with the shaft. But, they got into a huge arguement, and Wade and I went off on our own. After that we danced, but I did feel really bad. I didn't want Heather to be left alone, so we went to go look for her to see that she wasn't actually alone, and she wasn't. So we gave them their space, went and danced some more. Danny and Alex VanAllen were there, and Danny was being stalkish and possessive of me. Argh, I knew that was going to happen. But oh well, I wasn't about to dance with him, because I know I'd give him the wrong idea. :-)  But... things with my date Wade were a lot better than I had feared. We talked a lot, laughed a lot, danced a lot, and had an overall great time. Things at time were hectic, but he was so well mannered! He gave me his jacket twice to wear because I was cold, and made sure that he didn't leave me for more than a few seconds at the most. He walked me to the door, and I hugged him goodnight. It was really great. Oh, and we got some sweet pictures done too, I hope they turn out good. :-)
