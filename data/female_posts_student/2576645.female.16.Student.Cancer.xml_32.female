This blog has become the 'parade of templates'.  ::...gotta change things up....gotta keep 'em fresh.....::  It seems like a long time since I have sat down and typed in a good mood. I think its because it was such a nice day. The weather can affect everything.  Why do people always say that when no one has anything else to talk about, they resort to talking about the weather? I think the weather is the universal conversation starter. Even a blind man can tell you what the weather is like outside.   When the weather is crappy.... I feel crappy.  When the weather is sunny..... I feel cheery.  And so on and so forth.  ..........................HOW I LONG FOR SPRING BREAK!!!............................  I    miss          summer                      and                             it                              misses                                        me!
