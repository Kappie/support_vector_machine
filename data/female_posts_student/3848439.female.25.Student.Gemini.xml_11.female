After hitting Hyde Park Produce, the 53rd Street Rip-Off…er, I mean 53rd Street Co-Op then the 47th Street Co-Op I had a great assortment of food.  I was in the midst of making  urlLink Spanakopita, Moosewood Cookbook style  (it's a baked Greek dish with spinach, feta cheese, onions, garlic,  herbs sandwiched between buttered layers of filo pastry dough - serious  yum  -age).  I had just started to mix the cheese into the spinach/onion/garlic/herbs mixture.  Then I realized I needed fruit for tomorrow’s lunch.  So I decided to make a true trip of it.  About halfway through the 53rd Street jaunt, I had a hankering for Bagels with Lox.  But not just any bagels with lox.  No, these puppies must replicate the joy of the bagel shop near my freshman dorm in college.  Bagel, cream cheese, lox, red onion rings,  capers.  Capers!  That’s what it’s all about!  I like some brine with my raw salmon.  I believe they called it the "Lake Norman." I knew I had some capers in the fridge, so I wouldn't need to buy any.  But, alas, 53rd Street didn’t have any good looking lox.  Anyway.  I also wanted turkey breakfast sausage and other random crap.  So I went up to 47th Street.  While there, I got the bagel w/lox stuff, but I also came across some pork  veggie potstickers. Yum!  And I even have a decently easy recipe here at the apartment for potsticker sauce.  I also bought a bottle spring roll sauce on a whim, but I couldn’t find frozen spring rolls.  When I’m more ambitious some weekend, I might try to make some up.  Can’t be but so hard.  They did have spring roll wrappers, so that’s probably the hardest part.  Right?  Right?!?!   ::crickets chirping in background::   Well then.  So, now the spanakopita’s done and I’ve had a semi-spectacular bagel w/lox – apparently I didn’t have capers in the fridge (blast!), so I just left off the red onions.  All or nothing with the Lake Norman special, my friends.  But I also found  urlLink mochi ice cream balls  while looking for the frozen spring rolls.   I think you can find them at  urlLink Trader Joe’s  and other places that cater to condiment-and-funky-food fiends like myself.  Wonderful stuff!
