Which i think is okay since you learn alot from space In science we were doing space, I did this big styrophome universe Whatever happened to that? La la... I am very bored. This is all very boring There are so many words that rhyme with boring snoring, pouring, louring.. Louring. Why isn't that a word? Who gets to make up the words anyway? Is there some over-weight guy sitting in a breaking wooden chair.. Just making up the words on his crinkled piece of paper? I want to. Do you think if the world got waterguns we could put out the sun? Then we would have a nice world of darkness. Cool. But then we're getting back to the whole science thing.. Darkness. Black. I like wearing black. I don't know why my parents are so against it. I mean if I wore white everyday they wouldn't care... Its as if they think black is evil Really black banishes negative evil things anyway So we're all safer wearing black. Like at night time we should all be in our satin black pj's yelling at the top of our lungs: "Stay away evil people I'm in my blackhouse!" That would be interesting. I think I am a very sad person. Deprived of sanity. Hmm.. I wish I had talent. Ja Rule is in alot of movies lately. Ahhmyspacebarwon't work.. its fixed now Cease the moment you only live once Why is that? Why is it that there is no exact answer to how it all began? Why do people waste so much time being racist when all the fighting really isn't going to do anything. Bombs won't do a thing. Pete. I hate that name. I suppose I could be called Peter but theres always that one bastard who'll call you Pete I love my friends. Seriously I couldn't live without them. I am so close with some of them. I wish I could talk to my mum.. The brady bunch is a hoax. What family is really happy? Plus they'd have the day to day stress of having to feed six kids.. Whatever happened to that Scott Cain popstar guy?
