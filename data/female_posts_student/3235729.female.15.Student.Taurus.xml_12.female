I went down to the gravel, head to the barrell. Take this life and end this struggle.  -Distillers' "City of Angels"   I usually start my blogs with a song when I start blogging and that particular song is playing, or when I don't have too many topics to blog about. It's a little bit of both. Mainly the one about the lacking of the topics. It's very hard to blog under pressure. By that, I mean, when someone is  forcing  you to blog. *ahem ahem LINDSAY...* Anywho, so, in the words of Ashley, (except the name is changed) "If you feel like complaining about this blog, please, blame Lindsay. It's all her fault." So, today, I did nothing. Absolutely nothing. N-O-T-H-I-N-G. Nothing. I'm still grounded. And I'm  trying  to be a suck-up to my mom, but it's  extremely  hard, when she's being the world's biggest bitch. So, I think, ultimately, as far as having people sleep over on my birthday and going to the Distillers go, I'm digging myself a bigger hole. So I'm going to  try  to be a big suck-up (yes, Lindsay, SUCKDASHUP) in order to achieve Distillery goodness and having people sleep over on my birthday...goodness. Yeees, b'y. But...I'm gonna bail.    -Joebie
