We had a little "party". I think that's the only class where we're going to celebrate the end of the year. But Ms. Tierney did get a little soft on us and said how we were a nice class and all of that (none too sincerely) and gave us bags of her homemade chocolates, which Jieun and I agree are not quite homemade chocolates. I guess I'm going to miss that class, a bit. There really were some memorable moments in Room 714. Last night I stayed at Jieun's house until midnight studying for the unbelievably easy AFS final, and she, Lindsay and I spent almost two hours of that cooking and eating, and scraping onions off the floor (in my case, kicking onions around on the floor), and maybe about three more talking, laughing, and ultimately getting off subject. It was so much fun, we've agreed to hold multiple "study nights" over the summer where we will watch movies and eat flan, New Zealand pudding, and chocolate cake. The day before that, I went to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (opening night!) after school with Jieun, Pearl, Lindsay, Katie, Anita, Cynthia, and Caitlin. It was much better than the first two, and there were a couple of people that dressed up, so that was interesting. Oh, and I've never had to wait in a line like that to get into a movie before-- it was weird. Afterwards, we went to eat at Fuddruckers, where I was tempted to get an ostrich burger, but didn't. I went for turkey instead. Turkeys are kind of like little ostritches, right? Also, yesterday I had a piano recital where I was given a nice Certificate of Merit certificate (how redundant) and I left it on my chair. Hopefully my piano teacher will not eat it. There's still much to be done, especially math stuff, and my writing is not exactly sparkling with wit, so goodbye. Oh, and I forgot, another interesting tidbit: I have a live lobster in my refrigerator. I'm dead serious.
