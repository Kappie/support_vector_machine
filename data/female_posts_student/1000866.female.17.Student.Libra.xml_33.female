I know I'm getting worked up over almost nothing...I mean, she says they'd have to pay her a lot to go, and that it's not probable, but still...Calfornia??? It's so far away, and I'd miss my friends so so much, especially with only two years of HS left. I think I'm about to cry...I should go do homework to get my mind off of it.
