'gangs of new york' getting oscar nominations 7. the fact that there are only 73 more days of school  things that made my day shitty: 1. 76 2. dance 3. negative people 4. cold weather  random ramblings of the day: ~i am desperately trying to figure out why kamikaze pilots wore helmets ~'break stuff' by limp bizkit is my new anthem ~when i grow up, i want to move to santa monica, california.  i will miss snow, so i will bring a snow machine and on warm summer days i will make tons of snow and spread it around my whole yard, just to weird my neighbors out.  i will then proceed to put on my swimsuit and roll around in the white stuff (the snow, you perves!!)  i will then put on some big band/jazz/swing music and proceed to drink martinis all afternoon while i tan.  quote of the day: “I am free of all prejudices. I hate everyone equally. “ -- W.C. Fields
