But, when u see him with his long ass hair and not shaved and this little sprout of facial hair below his mouth he looks like a white dude with very long hair. o and also he kinda resembles johnny depp. i dunno how some person can have short hair and look mexican and then grow it out and look white, but he does and its creepy. so yea, theres my adventures of summer and theyve been actually takin me away from the usual summer is sooo boring! i mean we always have a time of the day that is boring like right now but wow summer has been awesome so far. and ive hooked up with 2 guys. but the second guy i may not name for certain reasons i dont want someone to get mad at me and yea, but not the fact that hes ugly and i regret it its the fact that i explained to u.  -blo job betty on the way to rescue u! (:
