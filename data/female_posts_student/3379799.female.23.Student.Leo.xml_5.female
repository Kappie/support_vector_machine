I would like to think that in this world of cynics, I am "a true child," of God by sometimes just truly beliveing that peoplpe are inherently good.  That's where Dyonne comes in.  She is the voice inside my head that reminds me to stay true to my belief, yet leave room for what is usually bound to happen, LET DOWN.  "Are you surprised?"  The question is so rhetorical at times I can't even say anything, just hang my head in shame.  If you are not following, let me help ya'.  Girlfriends: (1) When you let a guy "hit," after only knowing him for the first two days of the month and he doesn't call u, or worst, he ask for money.  Why are you surprised to find that he has no job, does not want you for anything but _ss and money, and how stupid you look now you dumb ho(just playing)-ARE YOU SURPRISED? (2) Your braids are so old your newgrowth is longer than the braid, and your braid falls out while you are dancing at the club.  ARE YOU SURPRISED? Get that sh_t redone. (3) While you and "the guy" are out, a "homegirl" comes and speaks, then goes to the table with her friends and starts laughing. you should automatically assume they are laughing at your dumb ass. Later you find that ain't his homegirl, its his baby's mama.  ARE YOU SURPRISED?  Brothers:(YOU GET JUST ONE) (1) You meet a girl, she says she does not do the "oral" thing. She is saving that special gift for a special person.  But ya'll start doing it and she flips you over "Hulk Hogan style, spreads your legs apart and licks you everywhere so good that it could only be conceived that she has never let a popsicle drop fall away from her mouth.  Later you find out she is a bonafide hoe. ARE YOU SURPRISED?  You see, the element of surprise has the ability to make a fool of everyone.  Take Dyonne's advice,"Just assume the worst so that when you get the best, you can be SURPRISED!"  DO BETTER!!!
