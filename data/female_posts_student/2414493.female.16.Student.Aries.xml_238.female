I wish I had some alternative swear word; I was going to say "Christ," again. Well, you know what I mean.   We all have our problems, I guess. It's no help that everyone has to share them and spread the joy. I really am fine. I just momentarily got pissed.  I have to remember I have "jorge luis borges" scrawled in highlighter here before it fades away. Ah, books.  If everyone just stopped PMS-ing on me, I think it'd help greatly. Or if I just sat down all day and scribbled in a notebook. I think that's just about the only thing that keeps me sane these days.  NOBODY'S HOME, mentally.  Ah, it's Franz Ferdinand. Congealed brains, how incredibly appropriate.  How come I can be happy for a while and let everyone else just trample on it? Because I'm weak. Because I care too much about what other people say.  The downside to never telling anyone the whole story (especially the parents) is that there's a whole lot of explaining to do when you screw up. So either I have to be absolutely invincible or as open as a book. I choose invincibility. Not going to happen, so I'm screwed anyways. How lovely. Happy summer, people.  Well guess what, 48 hours from now I'll probably be sitting in a plane, seat 6E, ready to take off and visit the land of no curfew, no parents and big big city.  If I were Christian, would I handle things differently? They always seem so saintly. I'm anything but and all over the place.  Looking at my life from a distance assures me that having children will be one hell of a ride.  Ok, I'm really calm now. I think I'll go pack: look for spare staples, find a tape dispenser, scissors. Towel, crap like that. I need to fish the Franz Ferdinand CD out of the car and play it at volume level 16 to make me happy. I'm happy, darnit. It takes a little believing yet.
