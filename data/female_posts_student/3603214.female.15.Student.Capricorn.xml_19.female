It was decided that I am a very bitter person that doesn't like the world...or at least most of it. All I have to say is HAPPY PILLS dude...HAPPY PILLS for those who want to be FREAKISHLY HAPPY...n not high lol. That won't cut it. Amber, thanx for the gross-out story of the week w/ ur cousins n their bike crashes. Much needed info there. lol So...My Godspell song is gonna b hott. lol...Well now...I'm at a loss for words...what a sad, sad day...hour...w/e
