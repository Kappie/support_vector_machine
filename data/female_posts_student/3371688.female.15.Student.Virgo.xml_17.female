Luke and i had gone off to wander on our own one day. we thought it was all right, then my brother saw some pretty hot girls (he and his girlfriend had broken up a few weeks before we left) and that's when i saw a pretty hot guy. he was with a group of a lot of kids, probably all about 16 or 17. he stood out though. stawberry blonde hair, skinny, but it was mostly muscle, and very very icy blue eyes. he looked at me too. he looked hard. or i just thought he was looking hard, but it could have just been his intense eyes. either way, he liked me enough to check quickly that no one was watching, tap another guy on the arm, and come up to where i was sitting. i remember it was really beautiful out and there were a few clouds far away but that was it. i also remember that he came right up to me and made no effort to be discreet. i think i was starting at him the whole time (probably with my mouth open)but that didn't seem to matter. as soon as he got up to me, he simply introduced himself. "hi there, i'm sam. do you mind if i sit?" he had a decent irish accent, and his smile made his eyes seem less intense. one thing about him that was the most specific, was the muscles that stood out in his jaw. you know when someone squeezes their jaw together and you can see these little muscles stick out? yeah, he had that. and i had it bad. i just smiled, he didn't seem mind my braces, so i said i'd love if he sat and i told him my name. one thing i don't remember is what all we talked about. i remember it was about 1:00 when i met him and when my brother came back at 7:00, we were still talking. there was music, something about the incredible hulk and spiderman, and not many serious topics. he asked about other guys i'd been with. so i told him was i'd been fingered, and i'd given hand jobs and told him about the guys who did them, then about the few random guys i'd met and made out with. i asked him about the girls he'd been with. he told me he'd had one girlfriend for 2 years, since he was 14, and he had kissed only 2 girls before her. he lost his virginity to this girl. they had sex 2 times, then they broke up. i wasn't sure if i should believe him, but the more he talked about her, the more i did. my brother went to go get food, and that he'd come back at 8. so we talked more. it doesn't really matter what we talked about. but i liked him. when we left he gave me a soft kiss on the lips and asked if i'd meet him the next day. "i'm doing family stuff most of the day. but luke and i were going to go to 'muse' at 9:30. we could meet there." he smiled. "that sounds great. see you then." then i left him standing there. when my brother asked about him, i was surprised to hear myself talk about him like he was just some guy-friend i had met. which is really what he was. he didn't metion sam to my parents either.   i did meet him the next night. at the club. we danced more than we talked this time. i was surprised at the lack of i.d. checking, but i guess germany is just that way. i didn't drink as much as i had planned on. i wanted my judgment to be intact. i knew he liked me because of something he did at the club, that, at the time, seemed pretty big. a slow song played (someone requested it and it was in french) so we danced really close, and his lips moved from my neck to left ear, but he never actually kissed me, just kept them there. this wasn't that part that showed me how much he like me though. the actual part seems really corny when i think about it now. after the slow song was over, a very "groovy" techno song came on, he looked at me, then he held me close again and we kept dancing so so slow. i felt so good. so good. "do you want to leave? that sounds bad, but i'd really rather be alone with you."  "i'd love to leave," i said after i sighed.   he took me to the hotel where he was staying. of coarse i did the nice sister thing and told Luke i'd meet him at our hotel at 2:00. he didn't question me. we had to sneek into the hotel and his room had 2 other guys sleeping in 2 other beds. he coughed loudly when we entered. "hey umm, guy? could you do me a favor?" they looked at each other, smiled, got up, and went into the room next door.  i had to ask, "so who are you here with?" he smiled, "well...its suppose to be a retreat for the kids at my private school, but all the nuns are gone with the missionaries so they hire chaparones. and, thankfully, these chaparones don't care in the slightest what we do." "and where did your room mates go?" he laughed, "oh, they weren't mad. john is in a fight with this girlfriend, who's in the room next door. and it also gives brian the chance to make the moves on john's girlfriend's pal who came along. no inconveniece whatsoever."  i smiled (feeling relieved), "good, i hate being mean." "i actually know that already." then he came closer to me and kissed me. then again, then again. then he took my shirt off, then i took of his, then the took of my bra. then i took of his pants. then he took of my skirt, then i took of my panties and his boxers. by then we were on the bed. he was hard. very hard. and i was wet. he kissed me everywhere. i forgot about everything. but later, i remembered every detail. especially when he stopped and walked across the room to john's bag and took out a Trojan. when he got back over to me, he layed down to his face was right at my belly button. he kissed my piercing there and then put his chin down so he was facing me. "do you want me to make-love to you?" i nodded and smiled at him. then i sat up and lift his chin so i could kiss him very softly. and we had sex. it hurt, but i didn't bleed, and i felt good. it felt amazing. i heard that girls feel self concious and vulnerable right after they have sex with someone and try to hide their bodies, but we just kissed for a little while, and i got up to put my clothes on while sam watched me. it was 1:17 according to my watch. "are you leaving already?" he asked? "remember, i told my brother i was going to meet him back at the hotel at 2."  "right...but its only 1:20." i smiled, "well i expected you to walk with me for a while, to make sure no one hurts me." now he smiled. "i don't want anyone to hurt you." he put his clothes on and we walked out with no worries.  we didn't talk very much as we walked around, but a few key things were said. "you know i'm leaving tomorrow." "i'm aware. are you going to call me?" "i don't know." "so you don't want to stay in contact with me" he didn't say this very upset, actually. just like a fact. "would it matter if we did keep talking? we're not going to meet again. and you are, so fully amazing, it wouldn't work. i'd meet someone back home, or you would, and we'd just be more attached." "oh you don't get attached after sex? supposedly losing your virginity. virgins bleed." he said all this in the most acusatory tone, however. "hey, you don't want to accuse me of lying. you know i didn't lie. and you know i wouldn't have slept with you if i didn't feel something for you. i just want to be with you, right now. and not think about what's happening." he paused. and we walked. a few minutes later, he sighed, and then responded, "you are right, about everything. that's what i want too." we didn't talk again until we reached my hotel and saw my brother standing in the lobby. we kissed for about 2 mintues then i stopped. "i'm not going to forget you, you know."  "i know." then he left. that was it.   the rest of the vacation went by, and i had a good time. a great time actually. but i thought of sam. i kept thinking about him. and that, folks, is about when i changed. at least all my relationships. before when i met a guy, i would flirt to no end. i could talk to any guy i wanted at a concert, or at a store, or walking downtown, but once i got to know him, it all changed. i suddenly couldn't continue to act like a girlfriend. but now, that 2 day period of not actually knowing a guy, could last for as long as i wanted it to.    okay, so this is all made up, but i want to write a short story and this is the first part of it. don't be surprised when i put more up.
