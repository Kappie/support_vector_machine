In times like these, I have to remember my favorite quote: "This too shall pass." Like I told Lisa when we were going through whatever drama was happening at the moment this year, to me this quote should be used in all situations. Like when something unbelievable awesome happens, I think to myself this is completely awesome, nothing can top this ever, I will never be down ever again until I remember "this too shall pass." And at times when I'm sad, things dont go my way, or anything thats beyond my controll that upset me I know that "this too shall pass." So in this specific situation, even though things can probably never work out completely as I would like them to, I just have to trust that all these negative things will work out as well as they can and something really cool and awesome will happen that I never expected. Its hard to live that way, trying to believe something and move forward to the next step, when all you want to do is go backwards. After every really fun, good thing I find there's always something hindering me from having good days for a little while after it. I dont know if its bad karma, or I have so much fun in one night that God thinks I should equal my good and bad days out so all the rest of the world doesnt have as much fun as me or what. But I am sick of wasting days obsessing over things that dont even matter a week after they happen. This doesnt seem like one of those, but if it is..I wont be happy. Although, some part of me does hope its one of those. I have got to shut up...No one knows what I'm talking about except me--wait a minute, story of my life..
