I was a little scared at first (I usually am), but once I got inside, I had lots of fun and made lots of new doggie friends.  The next day I was still pretty tired, but we did go for a short walk before heading over to the last co-ed game of the season at Ford Park.  My friend Basco and I got to run around before and after the game, and we really tore up the freshly-raked infield before the game.  Yesterday, I was a bit overzealous in chewing on my new bone, and it made me quite sick.  But I was a very good dog and threw up in the corner, behind a door, which my mommy said was the "best place in the whole house to throw up."  I don't like being sick very much; no one does, so we took it easy, and I feel much better now.  I like reading books now.  Well, I don't read them, but I can curl up next to my mommy while she does.    I think my mommy said she doesn't have to go to her icky jobs anymore and that we can play play play for the next two weeks before we do something called "moving."  Love,  Caesar
