However, I do not advocate going around killing people to obtain what I believe to better for me or even my country or even the world.  Also in response to a statement from my co-blogstress, "We do not need persecution.  We need revival."  Persecution leads to revival.  It strengthens our faith.  It revives our spirit.  Feel free to write back.
