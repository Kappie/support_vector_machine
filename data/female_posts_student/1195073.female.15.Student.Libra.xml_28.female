Maybe it was just because there were a few of us pissed off.  Anywho, things have been going quite well, I was once again reminded today that I know a lot of phonies, but it's OK, summer break is only 14 school days away!!  THANK GOD!!!  Even though next year it's off to high school, and I'm a little nervous about that.  Well, back to the present.  My biggest problem is our Speech to Inspire and Impress for LA.  I have mine written and all, but it's pretty terrible.  We are doing watercolor paintings in MAP.  It's soooo hard.  Actually, it is kinda difficult, but it's fun at the same time.  We are studying the Civil War in Social Studies.  Easy potatoes.  In Algebra, we are starting Geometry, you know, they want to prepare us for next year.  Well, I'm doing some interviews and shit for 24dotz, so I'll talk to you later!!
