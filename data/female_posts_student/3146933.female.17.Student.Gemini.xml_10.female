Man, Friday we went to hville and it was pretty fun, but when we got back..yes..to sboro..we had more fun. lemme explain. well we end up on the phone with bradsmith and hes like 'yea andrew's girl's up here talkin to some dude n has been for the past hour' so me and monica and amber ride up there and sure enuf...possum is talkin away to some dude. Ok so Derek, I love him, derekpage forrestwilliams and coreywilson all ride up to where we are and freakin video tape it. hilarious. so anyways and then wrylandreed robbievalentine and i think it was botaylor come up and we're all followin her to the square b/c of course the dude she's talkin to leaves...so yeah 4 cars followin her. but we end up losin then and i had to be home at 11:30 neways. sucked. but it was fun while it lasted. she was mad.  2nite was ok though, me and monica met bradsmith at the park and we talked a while and walked his dog Booger around. Monica, it's not BUGER lol. She kills me. but then he left us :( and we went to watch Shrek 2. that was funny. then we rode around and there were cops up at the square lookin around and stuff again so we were like forget that and i came home. here i am on the computer. im bored and tired so im goin to bed.  oh, btw, i dont know what the deal is with matt. i love him though. gnite.
