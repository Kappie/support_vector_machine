It's not so much a label as it's your style — turning heads, getting numbers and raising room temperatures a few degrees when you walk through the door.   You'd love someone who could match your flame-throwing ways, but so far, everyone just melts like wax when you turn on the heat.   Got a romantic fireside dinner planned for you and your very own hottie? Better keep a hose nearby because sparks could start flying.   And if you're still on the prowl, waiting to find someone who can hold their own against your undeniable sense of romance and action, keep a close watch. They're sure to come around soon when they see your "Hot Stuff" coming their way.
