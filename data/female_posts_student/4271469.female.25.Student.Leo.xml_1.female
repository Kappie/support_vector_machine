I myself am engaged in war. Typically, these pre-nuptual battles happen with the future Mr. and Mrs. against their parents. Not in this case, unfortunately. While my fiance and I, (or as he affectionately refers to me, his finance), should be on the same blissful cloud we sailed on the weekend he proposed, we seem to have fallen through to the rocky sands of reality. Reality asking, how many parents of our generation set aside a substantial amount of money for their little girl's wedding? Hell, I would take a couple grand at this point.   Being the modern, non-traditional, we-lived-in-sin-before-we-got-married couple, I assumed it would be reasonable to suggest our footing the bill for the spring affair. With eyes glazed over, staring at the Mets lose another one, my fiance nodded in agreement. I scampered off happily, knowing that we had just saved my parents from financial ruin, and made the call to my mother. I told her, naively, that I didn't want our wedding to be a stress, but a joyous occaision, so my beloved and I would ensure that bills would be paid from our,(his), accounts. My mother was so touched, she cried. I felt mountains of stress lift from her shoulders as I went before my love with the great news of her happiness. Within seconds, I felt her mountains crush me through the floor. "I"M NOT PAYING FOR THIS WEDDING!" My groom was confused and angry. Apparently I mistook his not disagreeing with my suggestion, as aggreement. So what do I do now? I can't go back to my financially modest parents and say, "Just kidding, your son-in-law actually wants to talk dowry." I am left to try and reason with the cranky prince and ask for his understanding.   It's been three weeks and I am considering elopement.
