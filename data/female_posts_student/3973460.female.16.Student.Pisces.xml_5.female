Well, I guess that's what you get for being one of four kids, my mom doesn't like to drag us all out of the house, so since I'm the oldest, I'm always stuck at home watching a few of the kids. *sigh* Whatever.      The past few days, I've found myself laying down in my room, blasting The Early November and Brand New, and trying to drain out things on my mind. I came to the conclusion that Jesse Lacey is a lyrical genius. And that my life really isn't half as bad as I keep on thinking it is.       So, one of my best friend left for vacation today. One of my other best friends is leaving for vacation sooon. Gah, I'm going to become friendless! And before I know it, I will be hopping on the whole train (well, actually an airplane, but you know what I mean) and joining the whole fad in Florida. I'm not sure if I'm excited. To tell you the truth, I'm the total opposite of my family. They're wimps when it comes to rides---heck, my dad has a fear of heights! And if you know me, you know about my lurve for roller coasters and how badly I want to go on Dare Devil Dive at Great Adventure. So, yea. My mom said that she MAY go on the roller coasters with me. This is the same woman who claimed that The Runaway Train almost gave her a heartattack, so I doubt she'll go on any of MY rides. Then James, my "13 year old-Skateboarding-I'm so cool-I think I'm so tough-Simple Plan listening-I claim to hate Yellowcard but I still steal Jen's Ocean Avenue CD-Hypocrite" brother gave me the news that he doesn't want to go on roller coasters.

Actually I don't, ahhhh I don't know what I want. Gosh, talk about bipolar. I don't know what's wrong with me.      -Jen
