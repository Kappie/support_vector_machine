Remeber that I told you that Proffesor Umbridge was telling all of the students taht they had to ask permission to have clubs or organization. Well what Harry didn't realize was that that ment teams to. So he has to ask permission to have a Qudittch team. Well you can imagion that HArry was mad about that. While Harry was in class Hedwig, Hary's owl that Hadrig gave him for his birthday before his first year, came to Harry's classroom window with a letter from his Uncle Serius Black. Harry noticed that Hedwig was hurt when he took her of the window seal. Her wing was injured. So, to find out what was wrong with her he told the proffesor that he needed to go to the Hospital Wing because he "wasn't feeling good" he went to go and find Proffersor Plat, his magical monsters teacher to see if she could figure out what had happened to her. So he went to the staffroom because he new that she didn't have a class then. She was in the staffroom, but Proffesor McGonigall opened the door and tried to give Harry a detention because he was out of class, but she soon took it back when she found out why he was out of class. Professor Platt ahd told Harry that something had attacked Hedwig. She told him that when Hedwig got better she would not be able to fly long distances for a while. Professor McGonigall had known who Harry was talking to. She new it was Serius Black. Professor Platt told Harry that she would be able to help Hedwig but she would have to stay with her for a few days. So Harry went back to class and Hedwig thought that Harry was giving her away.
