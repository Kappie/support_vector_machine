What have I done wrong to warrent this emotional pain ? I want and need to feel weak for a time, a shoulder to lay my head and someone to dry my tears. I want and need someone to tell me it will get better. I can not go on. Daily I remind myself that without me my children would be in a worse place with no one to love them as I do and that keeps me here. Without them I would give up. Today more then any other day for a very long time.   The apartment has been sold to new owners and they need to get it up to code. Everyone is being asked to leave within a few months. I am asked to be out by July 31, they will give me a few extra days if needed and a glowing report. They are asking everyone to leave including Carolyn who is dying in #1 she will be the last asked to leave. Where will I go ? I have no idea. I've been here 5 years. THe longest I've lived in one place my whole life. It's perfectly located. I can survive on the rent barely and now I need to find another place where the rent will be more and I will have other things to pay for. I do not know how I will make it.    Tony is scared I will make him go live with his father. I can not get rental assistance due to his felony. I told him I would not send him back. I wont even though to find a place it will be hard because of his record. No one wants a sex offender around. I cant send my son away. It would kill him. It would kill me. Not only will the money be tighter, the place harder to find due to his offense but I do not know how I will come up with the money needed to move. I need about a thousand dollars. Hell at this point I need that just to catch up. I need if I want to be realistic 2000 to get caught up and move but no one I know how that kind of money to spare and I do not know how I would pay it back anyway even if I did know someone who could loan it to me. I cant afford to do this but I have no choice.    I know it's wrong but I want to curl up and die. Literally. I dont know how much more of this I can take. I need to be held. I need to feel safe but there is no one to turn to. I need help and no one around. I am waiting for Shaun to come give me a ride to pay the rest of the phone bill becuase I didnt get it done last night. To top it off Travis had his car break down today and doesnt have the money he owes me ether. I know more could go wrong but I want it to stop. I need it to stop. I need.. what does it matter what I need anymore, no matter what I need it wont happen.    Nothing from AC. Though my heart tells me to have faith my head I can hear the laughter at being a fool. I wonder what happened. I try to stop the thoughts of him playing a cruel joke. I try to stop the fear something happened. Now I know why I could not deal with this life before. I pray if he is for real, and if he is safe that he comes to me and explains. I pray that if he is real and is safe that he comes to me and tells me he is getting out. I pray that he comes to me and is safe and this is real. I dont think I could deal with this being a hoax ontop of everything else.
