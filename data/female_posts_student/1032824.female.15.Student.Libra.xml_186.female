Each time I go to the Post Office it's closed. * Sigh * Her songs are so incredibly inspiring, it just gets me going, to study. Hee.   Anyways, I've never experienced a weather  THIS   HOT . Never did I stop pespiring once today, except when we were in the IT Lab and Tutorial room. I sure hope it rains later :) My air-conditioner seems as though it's about to break down. The weather also killed the runners today for the 2.4KM run.    SURVIVOR at 7.30pm. FINALE.  Rupert  MUST WIN.
