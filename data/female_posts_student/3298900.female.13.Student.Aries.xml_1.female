Have you ever thot abt the road ahead? the life u wud have missed if u were dead? Heaven brought me and u together.. to bring others joy.. to share the sorrows of the pple. to bring peace to all..  the journey ahead maybe be tough, forget all troubles, love and lust. for God has brought us together. Friendship maybe at the baq of out heads, but nuthing beats the love of your life.  one day, this fairy tale will end. the clock will tick its last beat, the birds will chirp no longer, the life will soon be crumbled and, realise that friends and family are the only way..                                                   to all i noe
