But I pity my senior, she starts her poly days tomorrow. On the other hand, she spent 10 months lazing around in her house. No working. Amazing, right? She insisted that she would only work as a secretary BUT never as a fast- food person. And she got c++ for her 'O's. And her pronouncation is very, very, bad. OK, enough about her... Going out later in the afternoon.
