No use crying over stuck rocket. Anyway it's still exciting to go KL. Heard we will be using the air bus though not sure yet. Cool. I use that once. So nice and spacious and comfy. Plus got TV.Oh yes.... Here is a message to all the Daniel Radcliff's fans-a friend of mine just told me that tomorrow is his bday.
