However, when you post be sure to include your name that way we can know who's it is.  This is the sign on information:  sign in:  courtneydarty password:  password  This is out web address    foodlies.blogspot.com You can go to that address and then click the little iblog icon on the right side.  From there it will ask you to sign in.  Sign in to the above address.  Then click the little green plus sign next to the name of our blog "Diary of Food Lies."  Just be sure and sign your name when you post.  You can also add comments to other people's posts.  Courtney
