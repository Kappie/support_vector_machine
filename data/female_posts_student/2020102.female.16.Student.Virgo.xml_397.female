Ross: I still don't really get it. Connor: Well I heard this story like when you die you go to a courtroom and God is the judge and Jesus is your lawyer and Satan is your prosecuter... (tells story that I don't want to type)... but if you're not a Christian then you don't have Jesus for your lawyer and Satan is like "he did this and this and this" and God's like "NO MERCY!" Opie: You could get Frank Azar to be your lawyer.  Connor: Yeah, but... Opie: (imitating Frank Azar) "I can get you four hundred thousand dollars, but you're still going to hell."
