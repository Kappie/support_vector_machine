First period my precalculus teacher embarrassed me a good bit by singling me out and saying, "Did everyone know that Janine was such a good speaker? She did such a good job, you are a very good speaker..."  Suuure, increase my ego some more there Panaccione. There are a few things that people can say to really make me feel pretty good about myself and expand the ego, and that is one of them.   Second period, more talk of potentially making an appearance in court. Luckily, the school gave up. Worked some more in the technology department ... where I found out that Shannon, Rils, Paula (who didn't really need to take it in the first place), and I get to skip the final for Contemporary American Issues. YAY!!! I get out at 9:45 instead of noon that day because of that!   Third - Study hall I made applications and announcements for Aces High...how very productive of me.  Fourth - Spanish, signed yearbooks.  Lunch, sitting there as usual...and then my bag started vibrating across the table. At first I just thought that it was a text message but it kept buzzing so I look at it to see "Tycho Main Calling". I didn't answer quick enough so I hit "Call" and put the side of my head to my bag. I was pretty worried. After I found out that it wasn't anything bad I calmed down and was really happy to have talked to him in the middle of the day. The bad thing was I had not told of my friends about Tych because I did not see the reason to just come out and say it out of nowhere. Now that he has found out a while after the fact he probably feels betrayed and is a little upset with me. It happened like that before in a similar situation. I felt like shit after that.  Fifth - Chemistry - Mr. Pease got suspended!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How horrible is that? I am fricken devastated. It is so unfair to him, he is such an awesome guy. :-(  Sixth - History - Video on Hitler.   Now I think I am going to head out for a walk to distract myself from being hungry.   My cell will be on and with me.   Music department concert at 7:00pm at the high school. I think that I am going to go to that. My cell will still be on during, but I won't answer right away. If I get a call I'll give a quick call back during an intermission.   Well, talk to y'all later!  -J9
