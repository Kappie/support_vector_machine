Yes, it is my firm belief that God is the governing force of the entire universe. However, not all feel the same way as me. I did, in fact, still want to present love as a universal concept to those of different religions etc. I did not do this with time, though, because it is not as important as love and also interpretted many ways. I'm not saying that Christianity takes a back seat. I'm simply saying that in hopes of appealing to everyone, I tried to go meerly by reason instead of rhyme, so to speak.
