Even though I absolutely HATE getting injured, there's something obsessive about dealing with the injury itself. I always want to show people, and I am such a baby! I never nurture myself as much as when I'm injured, which happens more than you might think. The last big injury was the coffee maker incident, which resulted in a very bad scalding burn on my right hand. It sucked big time, but it was an amazingly impressive injury. I wore a gauze hand wrap for a few weeks. But damn, it sucked happening. There's this point while you're healing where the injury kinda hurts, and is still gross, when it is best to show off the injury. I'm already at that point with the knee, so it clearly wasn't the worst injury. But what's worse than the skinned knee is the deep bruising beneath it. I took the entire fall on my knee. Ouch.   Okay, time to stop wasting time thinking about my knee and get to work writing my two papers due tomorrow. I hate that shit.
