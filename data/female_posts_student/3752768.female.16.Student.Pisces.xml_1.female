When I woke up Eka wasnt home so I was like uhhh...this is not good. lol. So I got a hold of my mom and she said it was fine if Ryan came and got me and went to his house.        When we got there we just hung out and played on the computer. He had chores to do so I got to watch him do that...but yeah...I always have a good time with Ryan. He is my everything. I love him more then I love anyone.         So I got home at like 1pm and I was so bored. I called Ashley Vickers and we talked for a while and then she went to work and Ryan called and then I had to take my sister to Ekards to get some stuff for her trip to San Antonio and so we went to the one that Ashley was working at and talked to her for a lil while. Then I got home and Iam so bored... lol.         Then I call my dad to tell him that IAm coming this weekend and that me and Kendyl wanted to go to the lake with Ryan and his sister. My dad questioned the fact that I was coming out tomarrow and that on its own hurt. But then he was telling me I was selfish for wanting to go to the lake, then Becky cut in saying her dad was coming and then my dad basically hung up on me b.c I told him that when I got back from San Antonio a month ago I made it in time to see Beckys family exept her mom whom I already met. So yeah... my day was only good for the first couple hours....
