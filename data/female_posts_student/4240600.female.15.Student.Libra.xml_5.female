Everyone keeps asking me about how sailing was, and I keep telling them how amazing it was, but it just makes me miss all my friends and the crew even more...every Ani song I sing with reminds me of Cory and Tiffany...And all the adventure and excitement was so much more fun than sitting around getting fat and watching the day go by.      All I did was go for a walk yesterday...I figured it was a rare nice day, I might as well enjoy it.      I miss working at 7 in the morning, and I miss calling back orders and feeling like I was a true pirate...I miss the cooking and the sound of the waves and the sun beating down on my face...I miss everything.      I just wish my adventure wasn't over.      Hal Sparks is on the Wayne Brady show! I love Hal Sparks sooo much!
