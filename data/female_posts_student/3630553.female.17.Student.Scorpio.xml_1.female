It was Thursday night and the grasses in the  UP Lagoon  were wet, held by the soggy soil caused by the rainy season. A friend from our organization had informed me of a meeting to be conducted somewhere in the site.   It was really late, around 7:30 PM, but they had to see my presence. I was reminded of its urgency. So, alone that evening, I was walking silently in the area; my eyes were peeking widely in the darkness. The sounds of the crickets gave me the Goosebumps as I tried to find the meeting place.  A few more walk, then I heard something – a strange sound coming from behind. It sounded like wild, heavy steps in the grass, almost like the sounds of my footsteps.  Is someone following me?   I turned around, but I saw no figure of anyone.  I’m still alone. Where are they?  And so, I went on with my walk. Not long after, the sound came back. I stopped and checked my back for the second time. There was nothing.  Could it be that my footsteps are echoing?   As I turned my head in another direction, a horrible ogre displayed in front of me at a distance of about three feet. I leaned my face upward to see its eyes glowing in bloody red color, glaring hungrily into me. It was enormously tall, about 8 to 9 feet in height, built more like a human, but it’s head more like a horse’s. Its watering mouth, half-opened, had several pointed teeth, which are about the length of my thumb. Its ears were wide and cupped. Its breath stinks like a trashcan that I thought I was going to die in suffocation. Its hairy skin was dark like the color of a charcoal. I saw its tail, moving behind its back like a dog’s, only that it was longer and hairy. It has bloody, long and dirty nails, like a cannibal that rips. I could barely inspect more of its peculiar traits. I just stood there while shaking in horror, gasping for air and wanting to scream. But not a sound could come out from my throat.  A single muscular movement could be my last.   This is not the way I want to die. Not here. Not now, please.   And there I was, shocked and stationary. I was supposed to meet my friends, not a demon. Silence remained for about 10 seconds until a drop of saliva fell from the creature’s mouth. It was disgustingly sticky and stinky. My heart was pounding like a werewolf’s as it moved closer to me. It smelled so bad. Then, its eyes widened a bit more, suggesting an attack.  This is it!  It was going to rip me into pieces. It was going to grab me.  I’m dead . It moved towards my body.  ROARRRRR!!!!!!!!!    AAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!   I opened my eyes, sweating like a pig and gripping my bedding very tightly as I tried to catch my breath. I remembered to pray.
