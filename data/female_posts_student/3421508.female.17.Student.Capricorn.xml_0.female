I know its hard to feel connected to something (and/or) someone who's not tangibly there but its not impossible.Its funny how you feel the same way about yourself that I have lately; like we haven't done much with our lives and that we're taking so much longer to do what other people seem to do so effortlessly.I never knew you felt that way. I've always admired the way that you seem to breeze through things and that you're so accomplished at 17 the way I've never felt.Think it just goes to show that you never know what someone is going through until they open up.And I'm infinitely glad that you did.  Just one question to ponder though,even if you had all that you wanted and had achieved all that you wanted with your life at 17, do you think you'd be happy and fulfilled? Do you think that you wouldn't have any hang ups or insecurities or regrets? Coz I honestly don't think so.I think its about more than that. I've seen so many people who are over-achieverscrash and burn coz they need to keep on achieving more and more and its NEVER enough and they're never staisfied.Its about who you are.Its baout being sure of yourself and not depending on things that are temporal to satisfy you.Waht's considered as an achievement to day may well be obselete by tomorrow.So why measure yourself agst something so transient? Besides, its never too late for you to go out and do the things you want to now. You're 17 mushroom('member the hair? =P), you have your whole life ahead of you. So don't be in a rush to do it all and grow up.Life is a marathon and not a race.The idea is to pace yourself and not push yourself to keep up with others coz you'll burn out in the end.The only person you have to beat and keep up with is yourself.Everyone is different so there is NO way of comparing fairly and frankly no need to.Society may say many things and value certain things but at the end of the day,so many people in this world are broken and on drugs and living lives that are killing them day by day instead of living it to the full.Just as it takes practice with many things, the same applies to living life fully.Its about taking it day by day and trying to do a little more each day so don't be so hard on yourself k?  As for the whole church thing, I think the same thing is happening. I think its about expecting too much of yourself. I am struggling with the same thing you are in the sense that I crave some sort of balance.I don't want to be the self-rigtheous Jesus freak who discriminates agst ppl neither do I want a double life.I don't want to be ashamed of God in a world that dismisses spirituality as being "flakey" and pretty much dismisses it as a joke.And I think that eventhough it may seem like you are commiting some great injustice agst God, just as for His graces upon you.Ask yourself what makes you so afraid of admitting you're the "churchie" type.Its not easy to depend on God's approval alone coz when it seems like the whole world is agst you and you already feel so lonely and disconnected, its the worst thing that can happen on top of everything else.Its not wrong Alicia, it just becomes a burden you were never meant to carry.Ask Him for help.You'll be surprised ;)  I love you my lil' mushroom. And I want you to know that I admire you and you inspire me for having been through SO much in your 17 years and turned out so well despite it.No matter what anyone says, I think you're amazing and I AM PROUD OF YOU; so proud I cld burst.We'll get thru this together k?  All my love, Sis *hugs and kisses aplently*   -- Posted by divine_prose to MenTalLy UnPluGGed at 6/6/2004 05:35:14 PM
