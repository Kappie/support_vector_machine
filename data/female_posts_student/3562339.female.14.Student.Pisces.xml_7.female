Yesterday was the first time I've been there other than to go to the JFK Airport since I was too young to remember.  It was a  gorgeous  day, and the city actually looked pretty in the non slums part of Manhattan.    I had to wake up at 8, and I happened to go to sleep at 2:30, giving me only 5 and a half hours of sleep.  We left at 8:50, picked up my Uncle Bill and Aunt Helen, her mother, and my cousin Alex, the biggest brat ever born.  We got to New York at around 12.  We saw my Auntie Cathie's and Uncle Raymond's apartment, and then went to lunch at this Taiwanese style food court at this sorry excuse for a mall in the Chinatown in Queens.  It had pretty good food, and it was apparently very authentic.    After that we went to the Chinatown in Manhattan to buy cheap knock off purses from this woman that my Auntie Cathie knew.  She was kind of worried that she wouldn't still be there because the police had been shutting down a lot of these shops lately.  It was actually kind of funny, because it was like a shop on the street, and the bags were behind this metal door.  She had like ten lookouts on the street, and when it was clear, she would open the metal door really quickly, and you would have to grab the bags you wanted as quickly as you could before one of the lookouts saw a cop car and she would close it.  She would put your purses in trash bags and then you would pay in cash.  From her we got 4 Coach bags, 1 Louis Vuitton bag, and 1 Burberry bag for only $120!  I mean, that's the price of a very cheap Coach bag by itself.  Then we saw this lady on the street with bags we liked, and we literally jumped out of the car to buy another Coach bag, and another Louis Vuitton bag.  Then we went to this park in Downtown by the Hudson River which was very pretty, yet very windy.  The way the sun reflected off of all of the buildings was beautiful, and I regret not bringing my camera.  If I were ever to live in New York, I would want to live there, though it would be  VERY  expensive.  Then we went over to Ground Zero, and across the street outside of a Burger King, we bought 2 Gucci watches for only $20, and I got a Kate Spade bag for only $15.  Thank god for the police, because when they turned on their sirens, the sellers got really nervous and were willing to give you the stuff for any price.  After that we went to 5th Avenue, and while we were there, we saw the Olympic Torch on its way to being passed.  Like 5 minutes ahead of it were these vans for Samsung and for Coke, and we got free cans of C2!  Lol.  That stuff sucks.  *Coke Classic*.  After walking down 5th Avenue for a while, we got hungry and we finally went to dinner at around 9 at "Joe's Shanghai Restaurant".  Apparently this place is famous, and they invented the 'soup dumpling' which is a dumpling with soup inside.  But since it was famous, the wait was a half hour, grrrr.  We ended up not eating until 9:30, and we didn't finish until 11.  The food wasn't that amazing.  Grrrr.  That means that my mother and I didn't get home until around 2:30 a.m., the same time my sister got home from whatever she was doing. I slept most of the way home though.  Yay for sleeping!  That's about it for New York.  But still, I would never ever want to live there.  You can't go five minutes without hearing a car honking, it's dirty, it's crowded, the traffic is always horrible, you're always rushed, you can never let your gaurd down, and all in all, apart from the cheap designer stuff, it's not that pleasent of a place, and it's not that amazing.  I'm more of a Philadelphia/suburbian girl.  Philly is a much more layed back city and the suburbs are made for me.  w00t w00t.  Sorry for such a long post.  ...la Gu  P.S. I'm currently happy because I now personally have 3 Coach bags, a Kate Spade bag, and a Gucci watch :D.  No one needs to know that they're not real.  I mean, they're not even "Couch", or "Gukki".
