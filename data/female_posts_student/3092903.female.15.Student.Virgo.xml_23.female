I actually had fun waking up when I wanted to for the first time all week and then having no responsibilities. But I've had a horrible headache all day too, so that kinda sucks. I got to hang out with the girls before practice like I never do, so that was really fun and a change finally from waiting for something interesting to happen. I've figured out why my life is like it is sometimes. See, God gives a person a certain amount of fun, interesting and new things to do and allows them a certain amount of time they can do these things, just so the person wont go buck wild all the time. But see, I think God forgets that I'm down here sometimes, i guess because I dont pray enough, but when he gets to me once a week or once every two weeks, I think he looks down from his lunch date with Jesus and says 'oh yeah, that little Whatley kid hasnt had fun in a while' and then he conjures up a lot of fun for me all at once, then he realizes I've run over my bill in allowed amounts of fun and decides to create a miniature version of hell in my life for a couple of weeks until everything has cancelled itself out and I can start over again. I can pretty much say that this little cycle has been going on since the beginning of May. Instead of my fun being like a Dollar Store brand battery that has a big burst of energy when you first use it and then fizzles out, I want to be like that awesome pink bunny on the Energizer comercials so I can go around beating on my fun little drum like its going out of style. I'm just sick of being sad and spending time worrying. It makes me feel like I never accomplish anything, because all I want to do is move on and go back to normal. But I cant do that until i know  everyone  is alright, and I guess by the way things look, I might just have to wait to put my bunny ears on for a tad bit longer. (teehehe!)
