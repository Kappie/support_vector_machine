It was pretty good too except for the fact that some inconsiderate a**hole spilled coke all over my seat and drenched my new sneakers and pants.  I left with my dignity in shambles, a loser sign tattooed on my head and my last parcel of self respect splattered amongst pop.  I will never drink coke again.  Damn that stupid, clumsy, blithering, idiotic, inconsiderate, selfish, damned, klutzy, boggle-eyed, dung-eating, low, butterfingered, coke-drinking, shame-inducing KNAVE!!!!
