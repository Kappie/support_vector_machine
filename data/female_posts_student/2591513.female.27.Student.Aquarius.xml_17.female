I don't know for sure if we will have another one, I will not say we won't for sure and I won't say we will for sure.  It all depends on what God has planned for the two of us.  I am just glad and blessed to have the family and friends that I have.  Especially the ones who have come to me with support with this episode of my life.  Maybe a bit more dramatic than I wanted to be, but I blame it on the fact that the pregnancy hormones are still raging through my body and taking me on an emotional rollercoaster.  I have learned that there is only one way to look at life and that is optimistically no matter how bad the situation may seem to be.  Thank you to all who read this blabbering and for those of you who have helped me through this situation.
