It was so cool!Okay anyway today I went to the bus-stop to wait for Denny to go to the guitar lesson together.And I waited and waited,but he did not turn up.So I thought he had gone to Kawai already,therefore I went there too.But,he still wasn't there,and the teacher told me to have lesson first. Surprise! Denny came when it was like 1.30p.m,which is the time we end the lesson!!!Urgh!      Okay so I went for my piano lesson after that and went home,duh! And went online for  a while,but nobody was online.So I played badminton for a while.Then me and The Bitch and my maid[Mini-baba]headed to the tennis court to play.But it was occupied.Then,at the playground,there were 2 so cute toddlers!One of them is my neighbour.She's only 1 and a half years old,but she's like 24kg!      Then I read my guitar book for a while and Mom came back.Then bathed and got ready to go to Jesslyn's birthday dinner.And straight to Tony Roma's!Mmm!Anyway after seeing everybody eat disgustingly,I did not eat much.But enough to satisfy my tummy.After that Nicole and I went to the NICE TOILET WITH AIR-CON.And then ate the birthday cake.And then talked for a while.And then headed home with Shinzu.
