It was not as much as I had originally planned, but given that I was hampered slightly by the lingering effects of my cold on my sinuses, I think that I should be cautiously pleased.  I have also set a new schedule for myself, so that means less blogging and more doing work.  But never fear, I will never abandon you completely, you who depend on the latest word from me...  If you see me blogging too much, feel free to leave nasty comments or send admonishing emails - I could use all the help I can get. ;)
