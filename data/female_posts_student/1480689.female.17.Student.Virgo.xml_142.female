You were complaining on why i was mad, it wasnt mike at all this time. It was how you want to talk to me so bad because i was in Pr and than went and talked to other people. I took that as very disrespectful. I dont hate you, i just dont want to be accociated with you if you are going to keep getting worse and worse. I first met you and i was in aw, you know that. Than you started growing into something i didnt like and it just snowballed. I dont really want to talk to you if i cant feel comfortable with you. Right now, thats how i feel. Thats probably how i will always feel. Sorry, you have moved on and so have i. I guess i moved on in a more blunt fasion.  enjoy, Geoff ps, dont e-mail back with how much of an ass i am in this email. I'm just stating how i feel. you will get the photos in the mail, not from my mom. Dont call them complaining about me either. Thats childish. Coming from me, that one should sting.  ____________________________________________________________________________________  i hate him. im so pissed at him. he hurts me liek this all the FUCKIGN TIME! and i let him. i didnt do anything worng, anything bad. ya know i try to be nice to him and i didnt do anything wrong. i answered mikes question and he FLIPPED out.  fucking dick.
