The correct winner of the "Smash Off," voted by viewers of "Pepsi Smash" across the country with winners announced in both eastern and pacific time zones, was in fact, Columbia Records recording artist, Switchfoot, who performed "Dare You to Move" during the "Smash Off."  Switchfoot also performed their hit single "Meant to Live" during the broadcast.   The WB regrets the error and congratulates Switchfoot as the winner of this week's "Pepsi Smash Smash Off." Additionally, the error will be corrected during the Sunday June 20, 2004 "EasyView" broadcast of "Pepsi Smash" (5:00-5:30 ET/PT).        *woot*  I GET TO SEE SWITCHFOOT TOMORROW!!!  woot woot
