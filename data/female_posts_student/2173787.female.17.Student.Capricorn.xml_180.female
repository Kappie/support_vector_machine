Capricorn (December 22 â€“ January 19) All the good things that happened for Sagittarius leave you lonely and penniless. Since God has abandoned you, you turn to Satan worship. You find friendship in your worse enemy, who promptly stabs you in the back.  check out yours on the  urlLink flame web site ...I spent the past week creating and testing links, someone had better look at it!  Horoscopes are in the "you call this a life" category and under the title "what does the future hold" and are definitely worth the time it takes to find them
