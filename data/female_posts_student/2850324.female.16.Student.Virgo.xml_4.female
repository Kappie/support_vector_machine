Or is she? LOL )*Laugh Out Loud*( Yea so, beside that my mom told me somethings yesterday and when i heard it i just left and went for a walk. Well, i was thinking about what she told me i started to cry. I couldn't believe it. Noone understands me. I feel all alone but, I know i'm not. I hope the Shelly will understand why i can't sleep over her house Friday night also I hope she still wants to sleep over my house. I miss her a lot. I'm gonna see if my cousin wants to sleep over Friday night. I don't know right now all i can think about is what my mom told me and what caused it. Well, besides that how's your life doing? So, what do you think of this blog is it total the new me? I do't know but i like it. It's something different. I wonder if my mom will let me go to my cousin house thursday night and miss school on friday. If she does then I can take all my tests in my classes on Thursday that if I was in school I would take on Friday. I hope she lets me go. I want to sleep over Shelly's you know get out of town for a night but, I can't my mom says she need me at home. so maybe some other night. Yea, so... if Shelly sleep overs on Saturday I'm gonna see if she wants to go to the AO maybe Casey and Jeremy would like to come it doesn't matter to me. I know that if Shelly and I was to go to the AO that us two would be able to talk and hang out and I know she can use it from all the stress and school and from work. I hope she sleeps over on Saturday and she can get out here by noon time that way we have a lot of time at the AO. Well, i'll call her tonight and you can read up on what happen on the phone and if she's still gonna come out for the night. Later  LOVE YA!
