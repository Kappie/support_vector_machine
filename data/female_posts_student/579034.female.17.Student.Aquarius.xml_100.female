Coach told me I can't go see Mick during Easter break causa Penn. So I got all upset cause like I miss him like crazy and then Coach K goes  "Keep your hormones in check."  Does she think I'm a horny little girl who can't keep her boyfriends penis out of her mouth? Not cool coach SO not cool.  So then I come home and I been thinking of trying to get out there in March and when I told Mick about the whole problem he really didn't seem too upset thought I'm sure he was... he was... I swear... And so I looked up like flight things and stuff and then when my mom came home I told her about it and she's like "Okay. Sure. If it's okay with daddy it's okay with me." You have no idea I was like "Really?"... like my world was rocked, my mind was blown, pigs flew, and the cows came home. So now all we need is the approval of Daddy-Do to make it official. x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x I'm happy... deal with it.
