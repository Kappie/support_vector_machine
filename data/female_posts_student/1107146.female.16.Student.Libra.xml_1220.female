And Abby, didn't you know that deech has  always  been pure enough to be God's spokesperson?  You're right about Wynn though.  At first I thought it was just that he didn't like me anymore, but apparently other people are noticing it too.  My mom thinks maybe he's losing his job.  I don't know though, that seems like something Wynn would take in stride and tell our group "this is something we can learn from.  God takes care of all of us." but he's not.  Something is definitely up, though.  Well, 42nd Street was really good, but I almost fell asleep during intermission.  My mom was like, "well, that just shows you're not back to 100% yet."  I was like, sure mom.  But then I didn't have to go to church and I got to sleep late, so hey, I wasn't too upset.  And you're right about no one responding (you're just right about everything tonight!) ever since you came.  People are forgetting about me. *sob*  Actually, Josh doesn't always have a computer...but everyone else does, though.  Oh, well.  Not that big of a deal.  People get to it when they can.  Oh, and Rosie, what was up with your mom when i called today?  I said "Hello, is rosie there?"  And she goes "Rosie not available" and I heard you go, "But, mom!" And she goes "No, not available" and hangs up on me.  It was kind of amusing with the accent, but it kind of worried me, but apparently you aren't grounded, or you're going all "Lindsey" on me.  Anyway, I'll see yall tomorrow except for Abby, who I'll talk to tomorrow.  Bya.  (Ha.  Beat you to it, Abby! [She made that up])
