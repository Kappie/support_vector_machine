Anyways I really need to stop worrying about weight, weight gain during exam week is allowed guess.  That is the exception to the I-must-eat-healthy-so-I-can-have-a-nice-figure.  I went to school at about 9:00 AM to review my English.  We went over my reading comprehension one-on-one which REALLY helped.  Then I stayed for the review cause he was going over terms that are on the exam tomorrow.  I wanted to do some Bio review too, but by the time the English review was over it was 11:00 AM and that is when the Bio tutorial ended.  I really have a lot of questions to ask and I want to go over a previous test, so I hope like no one shows up for tutorial tomorrow.  After all half of the people on my Bio class aren't like keeners like me, or have the work ethic of a grade eleven student.  Tomorrow is the big English final.  I studied lots today, and the day before that, and the day before that.  I studied my Bio extensively too.  I feel like I know it like the back of my head.  hopefully she will like totally help me tomorrow with some of the stuff that I need extra review and I am sure that all will go well during, before, and after the English final.
