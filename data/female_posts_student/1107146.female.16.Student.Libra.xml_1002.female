Then the weekafter that I'll add 5th, then the next, 3rd and 4th, then the next 1st and 2nd.  And Z, did you find out anything about choir?  Ok, I'm outta here.  Internet's been down for a couple of days.  Well, not really down, but it took my home page almost an hour to come up, so I figured it wasn't worth it.  Anyway, now I have a fast connection on  2  computers because my daddy is a genius.  And, Josh, can you fix whatever is wrong with my blog, because, if you haven't noticed, I'm pretty inept when it comes to stuff like that. I'll see yall eventually. Bye.
