So strange?!?!? Nonetheless, I am excited and think it's going to be fun to learn about the government.....(bah, humbug.) I don't know about how much fun it will be to get up and be in class by 7:30AM. I guess the good thing is that I will be done by noon and I still have the entire afternoon to study. Will keep everyone posted on my developments.   Jen and I watched Spellbound this weekend. I don't know if you have seen this documentary in your local video store but if you have contemplated checking it out - do it!  It was really interesting.  I just love the National Spelling Bees and to see how these kids prepare is just insane. And for some reason (I don't know what the hell is wrong with me?), I always cry when the kids win.  It just seems like such an accomplishment. It's chick flick without the intention of being one. Hahaah. Go get this documentary though. It's really cute and makes you feel like a dumb kid because you never tried as hard as some of these kids.   I got an email from my good friend in Amsterdam yesterday. Kim? Anyway remember me talking about her?  She's so funny - she's actually not going back to the ship either. (Oh by the way, I am not going back to the ship. Ha.) I think it's just an experience that one should have in their life once - It was fun, I met some wonderful people but I want to be home working towards a long term goal. I am sure all of you can relate.   Did everyone enjoy the link from yesterday?  Well, today's the link is a little more left field.  I think this website is just awesome! Virtually Lost dot Net. I stumbled on it and thought it was appropriate for most of us.  You can choose your own path on this website and the quotes are really incredible. Check it out.  You will like it for sure.  Not coming into Austin this weekend but probably the following weekend depending on school schedule. Will catch up with everyone soon. I would love to have an ECI happy hour sometime soon. Maybe next week or something? I will send an email and help organize.   happy hump day.
