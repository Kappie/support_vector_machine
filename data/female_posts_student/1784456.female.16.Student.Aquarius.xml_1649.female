How are you supposed to do a french exam without a dictionary? It's as close to impossible you can get without us not having to do it. (Exams really affect my communication) Talking to a revision book all day gets to you I guess. At least we've only got English tomorrow! Ahh, nah, I'm not actually that worried. (I think) Some how I'll fluke my way through it! Yeay!
