I think it's because Ava talked to me about them. She wrote them down in my notebook that she was miserable in Singapore. Poor thing. I much prefer my first 3 months class. We had no cliches, no one badmouthed each other, we were all very pally with one another. Why can't it be like that?! I know it's wrong to badmouth people but I can't help it. They've messed up my once-enjoyable life in JC. I miss my old friends, Jia Lin and Chii Boon. Boon's gone on to SAJC and is apparently unable to cope with the triple science course. Good luck my friend. You can do it! Jia Lin...we're still very pally cuz we're in the same school but different classes.  I failed my chinese. 40/100 but I'm quite happy cuz I improved from 21/100 lol. =) However, I'm just wee disappointed I failed maths. Ms Ho said I failed by only a couple of marks. Sigh...the results of last minute study. I hope I can do well enough in the promos to be promoted. It's going to be such a shame to myself and my parents if I get retained. I mean, my family are all so scholarly like and it's bothered me for so many years. My cousins all seem to outdo me. ALL.THE.TIME. I'm just so mad at myself. Though my parents say they don't care, just do my best, I know they care. They want to see me on top for once. I want to do it but I just can't. It's not in my means to do so. Look at Yi Lang, he's already in Uni. Stanford Uni at that. And he's only a year older than me. My brother was one of the top students in his school and was awarded numerous gold medals and awards. You can see how happy my parents, especially my dad was. I sometimes wish I could be like that. I've imagined it before but I'll never get there. Cheryl got 8 pts for her Os and what did I get? 8 PLUS 10 and was promptly kicked out of JC and posted to PJC. Luckily I was an OGL and could appeal back. Life was pretty ok in Term 2. I did ok in my common tests. I got an A for maths, scraped through Bio but I failed Physics. Ok, I was expecting to fail Physics anyway. I miss Mr Foo so much. I wish he could come back to teach us! Sigh...we got rid of our previous maths teacher, Mr Lee and got a new one, Ms Ho. She's nice. I like her. =) I think it's kinda important that teachers be around our age and not too old otherwise the generation gap will result in communication breakdown. Just like my physics tutor. He just can't connect with the class. I don't know why, I can't stand him. When you don't like a teacher, you won't do well for that subject. I really wanna do ok for physics, AT LEAST pass but I can't. I think I'll slide even further down than 47/110 for this time's common test. Argh.  Well, I'm going swimming at Yishun later. My first time in the pool this year. Can't wait but I'm gonna be all alone. That's alright I guess. I always have my imagination to keep me company. There's Bowling training later. Sigh...I just can't get the whole team to come for at least one training. Since Ren Yih and me assumed the posts of Captain, the whole team has NEVER been at training. Attendance was not full. I don't know what to do man. Seriously. What must our seniors be thinking? We promised not to let them down. We can't let the club be shut down. I would cry. Why must my life be so shitty?  Li Jia Wei's gonna be playing in the 2004 Athens Olympics Table Tennis Semi-Final later. I wish her all the best and I hope she can bring glory to Singapore. I just don't like the media hype cuz I think it pressurises the athletes. Poor Ronald. I hope he's ok. I could tell he was feeling so crushed when he lost to Boonsak (whatever his name is) of Thailand. He knew that our hopes were on him and he, perhaps, could not handle the pressure. Impacts of Media...sigh.  Jia Wei, don't let whatever the media says bother you. Just go in and play your own game. You CAN beat them all. All the best girl!!! Kick butt! Singapore's behind you!!!
