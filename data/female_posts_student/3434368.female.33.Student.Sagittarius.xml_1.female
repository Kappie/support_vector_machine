A rabbit and a leprechaun go and play... inside it. The rainbow is more beautiful than the earth. Everyone inside of it is full of love. The rabbit named Katie can play harps. And she sends music to her cousin Sidney in Texas.  (Second version:) Through my eyeglasses I often see a rainbow. The reflections appear through the glass and play... A harmony for all the earth... to hear. The melody is one of love... and not fear. It sings a song of harps.. stringing the music through all the land of Texas.  The rest of the poem:  I've always lived in this great state of Texas. I've seen many beautiful colorful rainbows. I've played many harps... as I see children play. They share their love.. of simple things upon the earth.  This great planet known as "earth" is my home where I live in Texas. I wish to hug and kiss my love... under a big beautiful rainbow... and we can laugh and play... while I pluck my five harps!  Tercet: I love to view beautiful colorful rainbows.. In Texas where I will play.. outside on the earth--my precious harps!  The End :)  Mind Boggling. Someone has asked me the origin of the Sestina. I imagine it is Spanish or Italian. I will have to find out sometime soon. :)
