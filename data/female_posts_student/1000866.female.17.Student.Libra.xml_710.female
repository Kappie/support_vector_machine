A lot of the occupational and physical therapy positiobs are taken because of colllege students who need hours, but she somehow found time for me to work in pediatrics. So, I get to observe and help out in pediatrics.I mean, sometimes I wont be doing fun stuff. She said there might be some filing but, definitely not all the time so, I'm definitely excited.   Anyway, last night I went out with Chris and Bryan for a bit. That was cool. Always a fun time with them. We played Uno Attack and I think they cheat because they won more than me. And anyone who wins more than me must be cheating. :)  Well, summer school calls. I've been lacking in entries for a bit. Uh oh. So, I better keep up if I want to keep up with the great Mary Clare!
