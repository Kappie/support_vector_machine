While babysitting the two Berger kids I watched the Disney Quasimodo movie in awe of the beautiful pictures and eloquent songs.  Writing a Disney song has to be satisfying, this is actually a lame fantasy of mine.  I mean what other songs do you remember from childhood that you can still sing to this day.  (My parents can prove this theory with an embarrassing home movie of my fascination of the little mermaid) Watching these old cartoons is made even better by the revealing trivia on my favorite website  urlLink www.movie-mistakes.com   Check out your favorite Disney movie and chances are you'll learn something new about it. (I learned that Belle makes a cameo on the steps of Notre Dam).  Though babysitting wasn't my favorite it was easy and entertaining.  Instead of Michael Phelps I watched Mulan and in place of the Thorpedo sat Tarzan.  Maybe tomorrow will be more exciting.  Give me comments about your favorite Disney movies, I'm just curious as to what you sing in the shower..."Just to live one day out there..."
