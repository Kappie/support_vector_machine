I can almost guarantee they don't have  urlLink Protein Profiler Plus , a kit which lets you display your own genetic code in art form, kind of like a forensic-era  urlLink Warhol painting .  The kit includes a sterile mouth swab, gloves, and a "DNA postal envelope". After your DNA image is made, it will be hand-painted onto a canvas in the color scheme of your choice. The price for such a unique service is actually quite reasonable, about $440.   Forget about  urlLink Glamour Shots , get your DNA Profile from the  urlLink Protein Store  and then make wallet-sizes for all your admirers.
