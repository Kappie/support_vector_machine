In fact, I would say that besides when I found out my grandmother died, the last time I really cried a lot was during my calculus class senior year of high school.  You see, I don't normally cry from anger, or from sadness, but from frustration (okay, I guess that's a type of anger).  And I didn't get calculus.  So I spent a lot of time crying over my homework until my sister would call and explain what I was actually supposed to be doing.  I want to cry now.  I hate linguistics.  I just don't get the problem set.  Makes no sense.  And thus I want to cry.  I've wasted so much time in the past two days trying to figure it out!! And my prof is not responding to my email.  Sigh.
