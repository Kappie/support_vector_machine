I should preface this by saying that I havent eaten fast food in about 2 years, so needless to say I was a little disappointed to find out they discontinued my favorite lil snacky the rodeo cheeseburger.  Even better though, I discovered that they brought back one of my old BK favorites: the Italian Chicken sandwich.    Now I know what you're saying "ew gross" and I agree, there something entirely wrong with eating a chicken parm from Burger King, but its just so good.  Fake sauce, fake chicken, fake cheese...is there anything better?  Only the side of onion rings and frozen coke.  God,  no wonder I'm always bitching about a diet....
