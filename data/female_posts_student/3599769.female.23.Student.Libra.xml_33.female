I feel like shit this morning. And on top of all that my lovely boy called again last night.   But it wasn't really good news. So I guess its just truly over and its time to move on. But why don't I want to. I feel like throwing a screaming, crying fit.   Why do I hate feel like I hate everyone? Why do I hold on? To nothing?
