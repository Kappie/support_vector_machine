Let me first defend myself against the malicious libel you hurled my way, accusing me of being nothing more than a critics lemming.  It's no secret that my taste in movies aligns with the critical consensus more often than yours, but my reactions, particularly ones as strong as my like for  Eternal Sunshine  are wholly authenticc.  I loved, loved, loved  Eternal Sunshine  not because Charlie Kaufman wrote it or Owen Gliberman, David Edelstein, etc. raved about it, but because the story, the writing and the acting touched me and made me think on an emotional level few movies ever have.  I do not always agree with the critics- I found their endless fawning over  Lost in Translation  baffling and both critics and the public were excessive in the fanatical praising of the  Lord of the Rings  Trilogy, a set of films that under the slightest examination shows enormous flaws.  A brief side note before I move on to your villain choices.  I am surprised you say AFI's Lector choice lacks imagination and originalitylity.  I won't contend it is the greatest stretch of imagination, but a reasonable argument could be made it is an off beat choice that  wasn't predictable.  I would say the institute (who's existence is both harmless and meaningless to me) in choosing an insane character, who never employs the traditional cinema mannerisms of insanity and only kills (offscreen at that) nameless extras we have no connection to, over a more traditional villain, like I don't know, say the number two choice, Darth Vader.  (As for your Darth Vader defense I like your argument but still think you're holding Catwoman to a double standard)  Here's my take on  Training Day , great performance, decent movie.  Denzel Washington's performance is spellbinding, but without a better script, a more interesting story and fleshed out supporting characters, the film is just that-one great performance.  That everything around him isn't on par doesn't take away from the performance, but ideally the performance enhances the movie and in turn the movie adds to the performance.  I don't mean to sound like I'm dismissing this villain, he was a consideration on my own list, and had the film been better it may have been just the thing to push him on my list.  I am a divided mind about Agent Smith.  Overall I'm not convinced he is a great villain, but he is the perfect villain in the first  Matrix  film, and I mean perfect.  For that story, in that movie he is unquestionably, note for note, perfect.  The second and third convolutede such convaluded messes no performance could escape the films maddening incoherence.  I think when looking at an artists vision you must look at it as a whole, so while  The Matrix ,  Star Wars  and  Lord of the Rings  have been cut up into three films they are, and should be seen, as three chapters that create one whole.  The final two-thirds of  The Matrix  is so excessive it eclipses the performance and keeps Smith off my list.  Your guess of John Doe is a strong one (Doe will be discussed later) but my number one slot belongs to Amon Goeth in  Schindler's List .  Ralph Fiennes laconic, lumbering performance is a portrait of true ugliness.  His character is brutal and powerful not from a heightened intellect or physical prowess, but from his position at the time.  The terror of the character is the realism, the strong do what they can, the weak endure what they must.  Goeth is almost beyond words and unparalleled in cinema.
