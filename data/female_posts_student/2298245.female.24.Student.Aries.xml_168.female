This thought came to me while I was waiting for my search to still load on Westlaw, and as I am still waiting, I figured I'd go ahead and record it here for posterity.  Or at least for the not so distant future.  Sometimes I marvel and the inner workings of my mind.  This is not to brag - I'd probably marvel even more at the inner workings of someone other people's minds assuming I were privy to them.  But that's what's so scary about being inside your own head, it's that, no matter how hard you try, you really can't ever get anyone else to understand your thought processes.  Even those people who know me best, and who can often tell what I am thinking, don't really know how I am thinking it - and it is not something that is easily explained.  In fact, I think it is probably impossible to explain at all.  And that is what is scary, because it is that very thing that can make one feel so isolated and alone.  Except that it shouldn't, because everyone is exactly the same in that respect.  So we are all alike and in it together on the outside, even if we are all alone on the specifics of the inside.  And I think that is certainly something.
