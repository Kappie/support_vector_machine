Also for some reason i love how he carries that green bag behind him/over him shoulder. I DONT KNOW WHAT IT IS. ps i want a bag like that it'd be cool. oh right and the hat is just amazingly sexy. alright moving on...   2. Hot English/Australian/Irish/Scotish but mainly English guys. I think we all know the logic behin this one.   and last but not least... 3. the song "can't help falling in love" by elvis presley. I know what your thinking, but this just happens to be my favorite song, alright? haha. I dont know what it is but its just so sweet. My dream guy will sing this to me when he proposes. hint hint. lol jk. just kidding everyone, just kidding!
