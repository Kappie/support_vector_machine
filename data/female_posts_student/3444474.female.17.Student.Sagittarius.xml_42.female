In other news, I got my trunk, it's big and awesome :D I also got a coffee maker, that makes a single cup of coffee, and it comes with it's own coffee. It's so cute, I love it! Aaaaand, my mom got me the "Mrs. Depp" purse I wanted yesterday :D, go me!!  I'm in a good mood. More after I see the movie.
