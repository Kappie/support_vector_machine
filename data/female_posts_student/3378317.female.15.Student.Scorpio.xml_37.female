WOW...    this is some bullshit..I fucking hate living here.                so yeaa. thats my story.        then later on, when Arti leaves from my house after eating lunch..I go upstairs..start reading before I get in trouble for anything else I may have done.        Then.    my dad comes upstairs.        dad talks to me about how he thinks he should send me to India Spring semester so that I can get away from all my "too-close friends"        so I break down, and I cant even talk.        so turns out, I'm going to India for Medical College and there is not ifs/buts about it.        This totally sucks, I cant even live my life the way I want to.        As for the party on Saturday, I dont even know if I'm going to be allowed to go..you know..since I couldnt kick it with my best friend before she says bye for a whole year.        damn..shoot me.            so I'm getting a job next week, dont know my hours or schedule or anything yet, but I'll find out.            This is my life's reality and I cant get away from it no matter how hard I try..they say.."Love is when you don't want to go to sleep.Because reality is better than a dream"...yeaa, but when your apart from your Love, then what do you do..        damn, I gotta work harder, and try to make my life fit together, been thinking about this fo 2 weeks.        situation with my rents: 2 months and 5 days now.        damn, so much can happen in just 2 months..            I'm fucking torn, I dont even know what the fuck to feel, how to react, how to fucking handle the situation, I just need to get away, and find myself, and my ground.            fuck man.                        damn..                                                    I thought life was bad on May 21st.                                look at my life now, I got no college fund, I have to support myself, and put myself through school, save up money for Driver's Ed Classes and then Training, then I gotta go to work, get a Metro-Bus PAss, then...I dont know.                                fuck..I'm fucked.                    damn...I'm not gon be able to see my best friend fo 1 whole year..    being separated from Mandeep is enough..        god damn, I really needa find friends..seems like I got none left.                        out like my lack of getting my life together.                                    damn..
