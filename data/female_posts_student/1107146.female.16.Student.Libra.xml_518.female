And then there's the bridge part, where that starts up in the left earpiece, and then it's followed by a screaming reel after four times of the line. And in the other ear, the line is spoken, and then a nice rap reel. All the while, guitars chugging it out in the background, Alex is pounding our very skins off of our bodies and...I'm...playing the bass, as usual, but yea. We're really proud of this biotch, actually. It's in the CKY/We wanna be an EMO band genre.  Speaking of, on the way home, Abby and I saw a license plate in which the first three letters were EMO.  I am SO stealing that guy's car! Even if it is a horrid life-sucking gas guzzler!  Anyway, I'm going to record s'more right now. I have to pick up my sis at 12 at school so...yep. It's right behind me in the bathroom, I might as well.
