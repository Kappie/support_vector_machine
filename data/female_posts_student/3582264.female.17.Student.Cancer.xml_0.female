Back in the 1700s, apples from this area were packed in crates marked "Old Kinderhook." There is even one on display in one of the eateries on the village square. Apparently people started referring to them as "O.K." apples. Gradually the term was taken to mean a description of the apples' "good quality" rather than their location of origin!   According to John Ciardi in A Browser's Dictionary: A Compendium of Curious Expressions and Intriguing Facts the expression "O.K." was used in the 1820's when   "...Boston wits took to playing a waggish game of 'murdering the King's English,' and in that game O.K. became fixed as the abbreviation for Orl Korreck. The game had played itself out by 1840, but the [Democrats] remembered it."   "Martin Van Buren, a native of Kinderhook, NY, was popularly known as Old Kinderhook, or O.K. In support of Van Buren's 1840 campaign for reelection, the New York Equal Rights Democrats ... formed the O.K. Democratic Club. The cry "O.K.," indicating enthusiastic approval of Old Kinderhook, soon began to resound at rallies, and the letters O.K. became common on placards and in political cartoons."   "Foreign coverage of the campaign, which included reproductions of the cartoons, soon spread OK or O.K. through Europe and Latin America as a formula of approval. From that start, for reasons anyone is free to theorize, O.K. spread to become naturalized into practically every language on earth. O.K. is the most widely diffused word form in history, rivaled only by Coca-Cola. ...When Van Buren was crushingly defeated by William Henry Harrison, the [Democrats] let it be known that O.K. stood for Orful Kalamity and Orrible Katastrophe."
