They were some of my best friends. Well, more Brandon and Peter on the best friends part. Brandon will at least be around some next year but Peter....I think he's the senior I'm going to miss most right now just because I have the feeling I'll never get to talk to him because he's going to Notre Dame. It makes me super sad. I almost cried when I was talking to Allyce about it today but, I was good. I managed to hold it in. Then...there's Chris. We've been through so much and I'm really, really going to miss him but with him...it's different too because I know I'll talk to him and see him and stuff. With Peter, I just have this awful feeling that I'll never ever get to see him again. :( Although, Chris...even though I'll see him and talk to him, I don't know. It's hard to let him go. He knows me so well and, we've talked about everything. He's been such an amazing best friend. Sigh. OK, I need to stop before I start crying again.   Anyway, other than that, the day was bleh. I just want this year to be over. Senior year, here I come baby. It better be amazingly awesome. Well, I must be off. I'm going to hang out with Matthew and Chris. I hope I don't cry when I see Chris. Haha. I'll feel like a moron. :) Although, I wouldn't feel weird crying around Chris. Not like I would around most people. With Chris, I'd literally cry on his shoulder and not feel bad about it at all. Oh well. I'm out. Peace. Oh yeah, one more thing, sorry for the depressing entry MC. :)
