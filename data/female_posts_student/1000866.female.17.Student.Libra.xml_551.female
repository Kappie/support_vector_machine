I mean, I was just absolutely abhorrent. I didn't want to talk to anyone but now I'm a lot more relaxed. Plus, I talked to some good friends for a bit. That was nice. I didn't think I wanted to talk to anyone but once I calmed down and after I slept for a bit, it was ok. I'm really happy tomorrow is Friday though. Haha, I'm supposed to plan something for Brandon, Peter, and myself to do. Haha. This should be interesting. I have no clue what to plan though. Oh well. I'll figure something out.   And now, I think I shall go back to sleep. YaY sleep.
