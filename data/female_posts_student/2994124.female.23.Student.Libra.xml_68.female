At uni all the words on the side bar were in blue. AND this new design makes the pages ages slower to load AND sometimes it doesn't load with the links and stuff one the sidebar hummmm.....  Wore my Canadian t-shirt to Navs tonight - you guys would be proud! Talked far too much in my group though, as we were mixed up again and had a new person, I was quite anxious (and then I get really talkative to try and hide the fact I'm feeling anxious) and also I had a glass of coke and so that made me quite hyperactive. I find it really hard when its a different group, especially with lots of group leaders in, because no-one wants to take the lead, no-one wants to step on anyone else's toes, so we just sit there and so I end up moving people on and asking the next question and talking far too much. It's hard to know if people are thinking, or just waiting for the next question. So sorry guys!  Had busy day: creche from 9:30-12:00, Debs for lunch and chat, computers to work between 3 and 4, met Ryan to talk about Tanzania fundraising at 4, then met Lizzy and Becky at 5:50 for dinner, then straight off to Navs. Have just got home now - phew!  Still waiting for more strange food experiences - come on you Arbabanels you must eat strange things in your house!!!  Night.
