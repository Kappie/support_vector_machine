Knowing K and his (sometimes irritating) eye to detail we got all packed and all for a casual day at the beach with his friend. And what happens? It rains on our parade!  We left late. Ok, my fault. But I do happen to think that speaking with my mom is marginally more important. And when we finally reached we had a rather long drive to the beach. Getting down from the car, I nearly froze my a** off but K and his friend decided we should go for a walk. Not a bad idea but it was so windy, and after walking for what felt like miles against the wind, I felt like calling it a day. So we get in the car again. Going to lunch, my travel sickness decided to put in an appearance, so I spent half the journey on my cellphone talking with my friend, with my head between my knees, so as to distract myself from the rather "uprising" sensation in my throat.  Lunch was a grand affair and one of the highlights I considered for the day. After that scrumptious experience (despite the tooth), we decided to go to the friend's place, during which time I blissfully took a short nap.  Blah blah blah, the rest of the day was uneventful. oh I should mention for dessert what I had was a cake, warm from the oven with rich chocolate sauce and vanilla ice-cream on top. That truly was the main event of the day. The sea was a washout. The journey to and fro was nice and comfy with me and my babe, not squabbling for a change but nice and snuggly instead. comme ci, comme ca. That's what the day was like...
