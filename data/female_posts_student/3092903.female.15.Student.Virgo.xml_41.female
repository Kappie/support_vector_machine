I am so SO SO excited about Scotland. It's so surreal that we leave in just a little over a week. I'm almost sad to go because that means the whole experience is over. It's just been such a long road to travel this past year. Its been awesome though. Its super rewarding to have worked hard for something like this, rather than to have just have someone write me a big check. I can't believe we are fxing to leave! I have so much stuff to take care of, like finishing Sophie's World, and reading about England and Scotland. AAAHHHH! Well, thats all I've got right now.
