I am so lost. He has not been home for about 6 weeks but he was in Indiana...now he will be in Afghanistan. I cannot get over the loneliness of the house now. How I know that for months on end I will not catch his smell in the house. I should be grateful that he is going now...in an age when there is almost cosistent phone access and some internet access. In WWI and WWII husbands were gone for years and years with no contact or news. I am sad right now and trying to think through how I am really going to go through this. I am glad that my children are not here. Seeing me break down and cry over nothing would probably scare them.
