Jeez, all his posts are so deep and meaningful. This is a vacation! That means you're supposed to vacate your brain. And for me, that rules out all deep, meaningful thought.  *spaces out for a couple of minutes*  *snaps out of it*  Eh? Oh, right, right, the blog. Anyway, Christmas. Alafair couldn't come down and party with us, because she was sick. She still is, but it's not as bad; I think she went out to the barn with Avery n' them today. But she had to stay upstairs while we ate Christmas dinner. Let me try to remember what it was...  1) Really good legumes of some kind. 2) Scalloped potatoes with...something...cream cheese? 3) Beef, which I didn't eat much of, for I am not a beef fan. Not that it was bad. Bruce cooked it on the rooftop grill and everything. 4) A salad that Lida made. I don't remember what was in it, but it was good. 5) Cheesecake. I don't like cheesecake, so I didn't eat any, but everyone else seemed to enjoy it a lot. So I guess it was good.  We had to "dress up" for dinner, which for me was just some nice pants and a collared zip-up shirt. Dad blessed the food, we ate it, and then we moved into the second living room for gift-giving. Avery had the video camera, Dad had the digital camera, and Lizzie had the basket with everyone's names in it. We'd elected Katy a few days ago to read a Scripture passage, and I wish I could remember which one it was, but I can't. It's from one of the Corinthians or something...It was the "love is patient, love is kind"...etc..."and the greatest of these is love," one. 'Twas nifty.  Then we had the gift-giving. Lizzie would draw a name, and that person would get the gift they got for their person and give it to...well, their person.  Uhh...that's confusing. Lemme try that again.  Lizzie drew herself first, so she gave her presents to Lida. Got it? Yeah...So we just did that until everybody got their presents. I'm not going to list them all, because I'm lazy like that, but Bruce got Laura a wooden cross, and Katy got me some lil' jewelry items and such, and Laura got ben a cologne bottle that looked like a silver Cuban cigar case. And other stuff. Most people got more than one present, since we each had 200 pesos (roughly $20) to spend. The only thing we didn't do was let Ben give Alafair her present, because she was sick. As soon as it was all over, me n' Avery went to bed, because that's what we do. I'm glad we're roommates, cuz we both hate staying up and out and all of that.  OK, that was Christmas. (Ben gave Alafair her present the next morning.) We still haven't taken down the tinsel, I think, at least not the tinsel on the bongos. Hee-hee...Christmas bongos...That's very cool.  But now we move on to yesterday, which was when Ben gave Alafair her present. After that, Dad told me yet again that I needed to get out of the house and do something...because...I've just been hanging out here the whole time. Normally, the idea of leaving would bother me, because I'd be working on my website or something...But I had to e-mail one  urlLink Laurel Edwards  about the name of my site (don't ask; too long of a story) so until I get her reply, I'm halting all construction. This left me with nothing to do yesterday but edit my fanfic manuscript. And since Dad said I  had  to go somewhere...  There's a Swedish pastry shop waaaaaay downtown on the end of Mesones street called The Petit Four. It's connected to a cafe called Pancho and Lefty's; I think Dad uploaded a picture of the interior awhile back. Two years ago, I found The Petit Four and journeyed there every morning for a snack (no easy feat, mind you). I figured that sitting in tiny pastry shop in Mexico munching on a handmade treat and editing the manuscript of a story was just about the most writerly thing I could do, so...I did.   Dad lent me one of his old leather computer cases for this trip so my laptop wouldn't get banged up on the car ride down here. It has this one pocket that's the perfect size for my manuscript, so I put that in there and my red "Second Edit" pen. Then I figured that it would be silly for me to carry that thing all the way down there if all that was in it was thirty-five pieces of paper and a pen, so I threw in my journals and every pen, pencil, and highlighter that I brought. Satisfied with all of my useless baggage, I followed Laura down to the market; we parted ways at what I call the "fake Jardin" and I walked down to The Petit Four. This was around...hm, I'd say three o'clock.  So I got there, picked a table, settled down, and bought myself a fruit cup. It's a bunch of fruit in gelatin in this...cookie-ish cup thing. There was canteloupe, kiwi, strawberry, blueberry, apple, orange, pineapple, and other yumminess. So I ate that, then whipped out my Manuscript o' Doom and edited. I wanted to get all the secondary editing done three days before I left so I could have time to key in all the changes, and in order to do that, I calculated that I'd need to get all the way to page 48. That way I'd only have to do two pages a day until it was time to key in. So I edited and edited...and edited...and got to page 48...and turned around...and it was pouring down rain outside.  Now, I must explain that when you're occupied with reading, or writing, or editing, or anything of that nature, sudden and dramatic changes in the weather do not come to your attention. I watched the street turn into a river before shrugging nonchalantly, because if I know nothing else, it is this: If you are going to be trapped by heavy rainfall somewhere in the middle of Mexico, a quaint Swedish pastry shop is a freakin' good place to get trapped.  "Hmm, looks like I'm stuck here. At least I have my manuscript, and money. I don't wanna spend any more, though, since I already bought a...Ooh! 100 grams of miniature nut-and-chocolate-chip cookies for two and a half bucks? SW33T!"  So I just edited some more and waited for the rain to let up. Around page 52, I got to wondering how long I'd been out, so I decided to go home anyway. It wasn't raining any more, really; the streets were just flooded. So I packed up and headed out, trudging along the sidewalks (where available) and through the ankle-deep water where I had to cross intersections. Fortunately, I was wearing shorts and leather sandals, so I didn't damage anything. (Trust me, dude - leather sandals can take huge amounts of liquid abuse. Said it before, sayin' it now, and will probably say it again.)  Well, when I reached the "fake Jardin," I decided to take a cab, because I wasn't entirely sure of the way back. Then I had to figure out the front door, which took a moment, since you turn the key counterclockwise to unlock. But I finally got in, and it was a quarter till six. And that was my adventure for yesterday.  We went out to eat last night, but I'm absolutely starving right now, so I'm not going to tell you about it. I've taken to not eating breakfast, not only because I usually sleep through it (it's around 8:00) but because my  tourista  acts up the worst in the morning. But now it's 1:34, time for lunch, and I'M HUNGRY. So I think I'll go downstairs and see when lunch is supposed to be, and probably eat, and do more editing. I've discovered the power of sunscreen, so the roof is no longer dangerous. (I've been up there every day and have burned myself because of it.) So I'll see you folks around.   Adios, amigos!   P.S. I'm gonna call Mom today to see if I can stay an extra week, past the 23rd. I mean, why am I leaving on the 23rd? Originally it was cuz Kristin had something to go to, not me. So why the heck do  I  have to leave a week early? I REFUSE! I'M STAYING HERE FOREVER!!!  You: But Meagan - don't you miss your family, and Lake Jackson?  ...  ...  ...  *falls over laughing hysterically*  That's a good one, reader. That's a real good one.
