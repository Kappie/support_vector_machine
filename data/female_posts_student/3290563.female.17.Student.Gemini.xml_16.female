I like being alone..or having my own space. Melody and Aunt Carol have gotten into a fight and it just....gah! I don't know damnit. I just don't know who to go to...Brian first popped into head...like I automatically started walking out of my house to go to his...but I stopped and just went back inside. I don't want to make the same mistake twice. It wouldn't be worth it. I'm deadly tired too. I keep getting dizzy every few minutes and I don't know why.  And Melody keeps talking to me. I feel like going to bed lmfao...it's that torturing.  Hey Brandon...wanna play frottage with me?  Roflmfao oh God that was great. I was laughing. I love saying that now. It's almost like Laurne and wanting to talk about sex.  Much love
