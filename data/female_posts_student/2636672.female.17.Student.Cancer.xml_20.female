Today was awesome though aside from my lesson...grr...that sucked. but yeh i was really really happy today, and so was Matt so we i'm sure we gross as in projectile vomiting beyond reason! which I love!. hehe. anyways.   my point of view on something other than how wonderful my life has been, aside from the damn personal statement, is the fact that i've totally drifted from all of my friends except Cassi and Emily Emadian, and it's not MATT'S fault no matter what anyone says, because in the past month he and i have only seen each other outside school like....7 times. So no one can blame it on him. They just never ask me to do anything anymore, and well, whenever i say we can do something it's OBVIOUSLY a STUPID idea to them...'cause i guess i'm not COOL enough for my friends...maybe they REALLY aren't my friends. so yeh. they can decide  -cherrieluck
