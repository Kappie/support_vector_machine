She's twenty and living with a 48 year old man who betrayed our entire family. And that's not even all of the drama. Although this might seem like something I made up for a good blog story, it's appallingly true. To add to my astonishment, I'm also indignant that I won't have kids first. My plan was perfect, but clearly that was the problem: it was planned. I'm seriously sick. Oh, and to make everything better, that dickwad she lives with is constantly on the internet (probably cruising for 20 year olds, now that he's gotten his fat and pregnant), so I can't even talk to her. Why is she so horrible? Why can't she just be rational and normal? Why does she have to be so frustratingly self-destructive? It's called a condom! Use it! WTF!?
