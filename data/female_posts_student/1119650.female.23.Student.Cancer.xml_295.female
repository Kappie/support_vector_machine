Needless to say none of these recaps apply to Sunday as I was asleep the entire day but here is what I can remember from this weekend:  Porn star Cali Xavier lives in my town, right near me. I met someone who stabbed someone and will be doing a stint in jail for 2+ yrs because of it...great... The weekend was filled with many ex-boyfriends and much cock blocking. You can't really call it a cock block when the offending c-blocker is the person's significant other. Quoth the T$: "Froddo Baggins is all over the fucking place" (I don't get it either) The Bronx Zoo rocks your socks off even when its really wet. Elephants really do need to be scratched.  urlLink Jon ,  urlLink Gwen , urlLink Anna ,   urlLink Sheepster  in the Skyfari = one massive neurotic panic attack.  urlLink Stew Leonards  is the Happiest Place on earth.  urlLink Meow TV  is quality feline entertainment. It is entirely possible for 2 smallish girls under 5'4, to consume an entire bottle of Courvassier in one night. Its not clam shell or crab shanti: its the fucking crab shell! The skank factor was in full effect. Stan has not accepted his undeniable likeness to craig kilbourn or the hotness it entails.  urlLink The Mouse-Like Hamster  has been renamed the Cocanya Rat by  urlLink Anna  and I. I think for now thats all I can remember, but it was good times...good times indeed.  I'll add more as it comes to me. **I just remembered: the Zoo Crew discovered that "w00t", while acceptable to say in an IM conversation is not acceptable to utter outloud in real life, cause it just sounds silly.**
