Not because they talk about sports constantly or because they are imature or because they don't always shower. Rather, they suck, because of the simple nature that they don't have to go through something once a month every year for about forty years. We're talking 480 times in a lifetime. That, my friend, is crappy.   And I bet the male readers of this are saying to themselves, "I really wish she would have warned me," but, I don't care. You see, my belief is if we have to deal with it that much, you should too.   I surprise myself with my niceness sometimes. :)  On a lighter, happier note, (yes, I've decided to add more than the two things) I'm going to visit colleges tomorrow. It's going to be crazy but I'm ezcited. I'm going to Northwestern, DePaul, Loyola and UIC. the only one I actually have a scheduled thing at is at Northwestern. Good times. Then, I'm staying downtown in my brother's appartment since he's gone this weekend. YES! :) No Naperville for the weekend. Who wouldn't be excited?
