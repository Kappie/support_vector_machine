A complete catch-22. But I guess that's the viscious self-perpetuating circle.   The other thing that's strange is how people who claim that you can talk to them and are your friends seem to disappear at warp speed as soon as you actually need them for a purpose other than mindless entertainment or lustful satisfaction. You can really discover who TRUE FRIENDS are in these times. You also can discover just how few true friends you have. But the ones you do have....are like angels sent to save you. Save you from what? I'm not too sure...probably yourself. At least in my case anyway.
