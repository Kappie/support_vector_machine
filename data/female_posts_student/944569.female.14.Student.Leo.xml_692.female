Back to scrubbing dishes for money again....I wish i had allowance but i have to do household chores for it.  Ugh.  Maybe i'll try to melt open my plastic piggy bank.  Oooh!  i just found two old piggy banks i used to use!  One is diguised as a stuffed animal and another i got from this scary kid from junior kindergarten who treatened to blow up my house ( Antoine...I'm not sure if Dana still remembers who he is.  I hope not.  She'd be laughing like crazy if she remembers...).  I wonder where Antoine lives now...  He always had this spitting problem i hated.  Whenever he talked, i would be sprayed by buckets of saliva.  Anyhow, now to pop them open......[suspense].......dadadadaaaaa.......damn...just a few pennies, nickles and dimes....and a two dollar bill....and......about 5 handful of bronze coins...with holes in them.....and they are from Hong Kong....How the heck did THEY get in there?  I never went to Hong Kong.  Maybe when i was a kid my dad gave them to me to make me feel like i had money.  Dang it.....
