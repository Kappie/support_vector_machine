For those of you who do not know what this means, it's a guitar of Kurt Cobain's creation. In 1993, Kurt came to Fender  and gave them a picture of a guitar made up of other pictures cut up and put together, a combination between a Jaguar® and a Mustang® (Hence "Jag-Stang"). Of course, his was left-handed. The prize guitar is one from the original line, since it was started up again this year. To participate, you've gotta cover a Nirvana song (or 3) and send it to the girl who has the guitar. To win, you've got to have talent, which means I can't enter. Wanna know more or tell friends? The link's  urlLink here . The contest ends December 1st of this year.   The Pixies - Is She Weird     i know you're rich in good clothes and little things your mind is fancy (and your car is bitchin')  is she weird is she weird, is she white is she promised to the night and her head has no room and her head has no room  your heart is ripshit your mouth is everywhere i'm lyin' in it  is she weird is she over me like the stars and the sun like the stars and the sun is she weird is she weird, is she white is she promised to the night and her head has no room!  no more of this girl cryin' i'm here, your big man you're mine  is she weird, is she white is she promised to the night and her head has no room and her head has no room...
