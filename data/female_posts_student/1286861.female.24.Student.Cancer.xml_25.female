I realize that this blog has become nothing more than an update resource of my life and times. When I started this thing, I meant it to be an outlet where I could rant and rave and be funny. I am failing�I feel�miserably at that. I gave this serious thought. I have realized that I honestly haven�t had the time, the energy, or the mind frame to dedicate to such ranting and raving. I am funny looking so I suppose that takes care of the being funny part. Any who�I am going to make an effort to get back to my critical thinking, not in that annoying obsessive way, but in that witty intelligent way.  Till that time comes�on with the update-ness. I went to two interviews last week. On Thursday I interviewed with Unisys at  urlLink Edwards AF Base . The position interviewed for was the �Base Operator�. I would talk to people from around the world looking for people and phone numbers on the base. The interview went well, I was called the day after and they said they felt it went really well too. They are currently doing a background check, so hopefully those felonies back in �97 won�t turn them off. The check can take up to 5 days, so we will see.  I was called Friday morning and the district manager from at  urlLink United Rental  wanted to have a second interview with me. I had taken a test and faxed it to them earlier in the week, and I guess I did really well on it. He kept mentioning how smart I was during the interview, I took it as a good sign. I left and he told me they were considering me and one other person and that I should know by today (Monday). Sitting in anticipation I am. Cross your fingers.  Rob came up again on Saturday. We talked and he had a chance to meet Steve and Kramer. Boy was that an experience�but what can I say�the boys are a riot. Rob and I had some serious discussion. I am still in a state of confusion on the whole situation�one of the questions I hope this week will bring resolution to. Also had a chance to meet a cool guy from New York, Brooklyn to be more specific. His name is Eddie and he works at a recording studio in Studio City. He is a great guy, hope to get to know him better.  Well, I think that is it for right now. I am all of a sudden tired�think I will lay down.  :) SMILE
