I am in fear for some peoples lives: my best friend and a girl who goes to our school (If you haven't heard the story or see what was going on at school today, ask me later). They both feel that they shouldn't be exsisting in this world. I have had those feelings before, but one was on the verge and one actually tried to take thier own life. I hope that they can find the strength to live, because nothing is worse than losing someone to suicide. It pains me to see that some people feel useless and unworthy when they know that they play a role in this world. So if you hear this, I hope you give them some lee-way. They are all loved by somebody and they should know this. But if they are feeling down about something, they shouldn't have to think death is the only way out.
