My nephew’s poem recitation contest tomorrow…  Want to stay in bed and have a massage.  I’ll opt for playing Battle Realms…at least I get to expend energy and bent my upset on my enemies.  Reflex therapy tomorrow…report on Tuesday, no classes on Wednesday (closing of Ramadan) though I’ll be having practice with the COM apostolate. Thursday is another day of 7-7 classes and Friday spells boredom and Saturday, another day in paradise.
