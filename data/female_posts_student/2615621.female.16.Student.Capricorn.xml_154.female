So...for the first time in years...my friends have made me absoulutly lose control of my emotions and cry and cry and feel like the world was crashing down on my "poser" ass. Oh and i got spat on for smoking a cigarette and drinking. wow...how can they talk to me like that? esp kaela?! shes not only hooked up with randon boys and smoked and drank (both with me) and smack on me about me doing the same?! WTF. Ashley, shes catholic, i can see why she would disagree, but dont sit around saying "omg ur my fucking idol julia" if u disagree lil fuckers. like ive said before.."YOU GIVE ME AN AUDIENCE AND I'LL PREFORM SOME MORE" i think thats my best damn quote. I dont think smoking an occasionaly cigarette and drinking the occasional drink is so fucking bad. and i know that ive said things like how i wanna go makeout with the kid with the tounge ring..yeah well..i still do. :p haha at least im not fucking him. things could be so much worse, and they dont see that. im exactly 16 1/2 haha wow im smart, and i think i can make my own decisions and live with them. i mean...what 16yr old doesnt wanna have fun? obviously ashley..and kaela only wants to have fun if its her and with her boyfriend. fuck that. whether hes my bf or not, who i kiss and do stuff with is up to me. fuck, its not like i sleep with every guy who comes up..hell, i dont even makeout with every dude that comes at me. why do they do this to me?! well, last nite josiah and bailey told me that it was all fucked up and they think im great and wouldnt have me any other way...they made me feel good. so lauren, when u read this..tell me what u think about it all...  i called my bro and got my classes this morning (after he informed me he didnt hook up at church camp, just made a really good friend--i told him not to hook up at church camp, even though its like the best place..but hey, jesus is def. watching then) and they arent fucked up like everyone elses!   Hon Eng 3- Carson Comp. App- Bailey Ap Bio- Bodnar Hon.Spanish 3- Castillo  Hon. Pre Cal- Gammons Hon. U.S. His.-Mayo Ap Bio.2- Bodnar Honors Thea. Arts- Diamont   i guess thats pretty fair..execpt all my damn classes are either AP or Honors. and i have none with catherine. muhahahaha  oh and thinkin about her, did u know ashley told me i should "stand up for myself" and tell catherine i dont like her instead of grining and pretending to be nice? WTF..hello, shes weird, her mother would be calling mine and we're 16.   *much love and war and peace*
