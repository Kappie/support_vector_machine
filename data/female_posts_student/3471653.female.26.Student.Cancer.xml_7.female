But we kept finding corn syrup in the most innocent of foods:  Pickles Jelly/Jam Beef Jerky Canned Fruit Granola Bars Maraschino Cherries Lime Juice Raisin Bran Granola  Since its advent in the 1970s, High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) has eclipsed sugar consumption in the U.S.  urlLink Recent studies  show that HFCS has disastrous effects on the liver and weight gain.  HFCS is especially difficult on growing bodies. So, maybe we should give up on HFCS altogether.  But if we can't seem to avoid it for just two weeks, I don't know how we could ditch the corn syrup habit for good.
