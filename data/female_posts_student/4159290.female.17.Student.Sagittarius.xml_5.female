So I got up, called David, and got ready to go.  We stopped and got lunch on the way there, and Daddy was being a punk and teasing me cuz there was this teenage boy working at the restaurant.  Thank goodness he didn't actually say anything to him tho, cuz he's not beyond that.  Cindy and I were both afraid he was gonna do something stupid.  But, anyways, we went to Angel Falls, which is this really pretty waterfall, obviously, that you have to make a short hike (about two and a half miles there and back) to get to, and then you can get in the water, which was quite freezing... cuz this is Maine, after all.  Ya know that Sierra Mist commercial where the monkey catapults into the pond or whatever and then sings a really long, high note?  That's what the water felt like.  Seriously, like you can't get into the water without singing a note like that..   it's instinctive.  I'm convinced that's the secret to all the really good opera stars' success.  We got some really cool pictures too, and a few video clips.  If anyone wants to see them, let me know; they're way gorgeous.  And I found a frog.  I took a couple pictures of him and carried him around for a few minutes..  but I left him back in his home before we left.  Then we drove to this scenic overlook place called Height of the Land, and got some more really good pictures.  There was a lake/pond with mountains in the background, and the sun shining through the  clouds.  Very pretty.  And I got some really cool close up pictures of some flowers.  My camera has this setting called "macro" which lets you take pics close up with really good detail.  I'm anxious to look at them on the computer and see how they look.  After that, we headed back home and stopped at the same restaurant and got some ice cream to take with us, and that teenage boy was serving us, and after we were back in the car for a bit, I commented on how the ice cream was really cheap, and Daddy was like "I don't think he charged us for your root beer float..." and I just kinda playfully glared at him.  He was still being a punk..  but it was funny.  Anyways..  we got home, I took a shower, called Mommy, and got on the computer.  And  I am utterly exhausted.  But it was a really fun day.
