The homes were tiny, dirty, smelly, but they were still happy people, and they were grateful and shared popsicles (yum!) with us. I loved meeting all the kids there. One of the little girl's name was Arie. (Air-E). How precious is that?   After we got back, we all ate lunch, and then when Joel was taking a nap, Allie, Me, Steven, and Kirby decided to put shaving cream on his face. It was actually all Steven and Kirby's idea, but they were too chicken to actually do it, so I had to. Well, I sprayed the shaving cream on his face, and then he woke up, and I thought that he was gonna' wash it off, so we all ran back to Shelem, and while i was running, I look behind me and there he was. I don't think i've run that fast in my life. We made it to Shelem, and i went in the bathroom. When i finally came out and was washing my hands, Joel runs up behind me and gets peanut butter all over my face, neck, and hair. But it was okay, b/c i got him first, so we made a pact not to prank eachother anymore.   Like 10 minutes after that, we all got in the Re-member busses and were off to tour Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, the Red Cloud cemetary, a catholic church/school, and a museum. All the while, Bertha was telling us stories. Well, she said they were true, but they weren't. She said she fell in love with a boy that was 2 years younger than her, and she didn't find out until they were almost married. She also told us that her grandma offered her 1 million dollars to get married when she was 18. I do not like Bertha. Yeh, and then when we were on the bus, Joel's eyes were all screwed up so he was not in a very good mood, and then Derket (sp?) put sunscreen in his hair. It was sooo funny. When we got back to Shetek, we had dinner, Roses and Thorns, and Bible Study. Michael Loadholt decided we should have bible study on the top of the little mountain/hill thingy. Well, there are tons of cacti, and other creatures living on that stuff, so I got a cactus stuck in my butt when I sat down. Needless to say, Liz was not a very happy camper. After that we all took showers (very cold i might add) and sang songs and went to bed.   liz
