STOLEN FROM : Seinfeld (however, I'm the first one I know of to use it for positive as well as negative exclamations.)   "X a go-go!" as in "He drinks three martinis every night? Boozer a go-go!" (Generally a method of placing emphasis.)   " GWAAARGH!! " as in "McDonald's rejected my job application?  GWAAARGH!! " (sort of a general expression of extreme frustration)  -Ian
