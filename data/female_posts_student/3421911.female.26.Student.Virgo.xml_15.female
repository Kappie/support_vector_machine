FPJ is a good man who should take defeat gracefully. if his intentions are authentic, he doesn't need public office to help the millions of Filipinos suffering from poverty and injustice.  i'd like to have a gay and lesbian party list representative in Philippine Congress but i don't have to be the one to sitting in Congress.  if one wants to make a difference in society it doesn't mean that running for councilor,  kagawad , senator, congressman, or President is the only way of making it happen.  there are other ways.  helping people doesn't always come with a photo opp.  believe me, these things don't really go unnoticed.   i'd like to think the Filipino people have matured and have voted wisely.  we will never really know until our politicians are done canvassing the votes.  4 days and counting . . .
