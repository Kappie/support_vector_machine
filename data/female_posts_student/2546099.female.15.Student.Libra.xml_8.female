Neway i have been thinking about it 2day. If it is a date then aftawards he mite wanna hook up wit me. Atm i dont wanna hook up wit ne1. Altho da last couple of months i had been thinking that i wanted a bf, but 2day i realised that i dont. Im partly afraid that da past will repeat itself, but i also know that i only like him as a friend. I know that i wont fall in love wit him, and the infatuation that i have felt the last couple of days towards him that has made me blind has dissappeared. Now im scared. I hate having ppl fall 4 me and have me not be able 2 return the feelings. But i know my heart does not lie wit him but wit sum1 else (who shall also remain nameless).  Maybe im just afraid, like i said afraid of my past repeating itself. The whole Josh scenario happening, not the almost stalking part and evrything. The part where i said yes when he asked me out not knowing at all y, then having him fall in love wit me and me do da stupid thing and say that i loved him when i didnt and then have my parents think he was fanatastic so then when i wanted 2 break up wit him they didnt want me 2. Thats only plays a minor role tho, the fact is i cannot give my heart 2 him no matter wat bcoz i dont feel that way about him. i told a friend last nite on the fone that if this guy she knows likes her she should go out wit him even tho she loves sum1 else. I cant believe i said that bcoz i myself could neva do that. And i refuse 2. Now i dont know wat 2 do, should i make up an excuse y i cant c amovie wit him or should i go and then if he makes a move say that i thought it was just friends hanging out 2gether, nothing more. Well luckily i have 2moro and monday 2 think about it, maybe even longer.  neways i betta go, enough bout guys.  One day ur prince will come, mine just took a wrong turn, got lost and is 2 stubborn to ask 4 directions.  Love hides behind evry corner...i must be walking in circles  Buh Bye  PS btw i am not in love wit the 2nd nameless guy mentioned, i just like him more than a friend, theres sumthing about him, but i dunno wat it is.
