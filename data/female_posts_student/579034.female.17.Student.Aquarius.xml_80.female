My essays were okay, just as long as I passed it. After school I came home and I passed out on my white couch in my living room after reading a bit. I figured it would put me to sleep and I was right. Erica called and told me she would call me when her mom got home to take her to my house so we could go for a run.  So, she got here around 4:20 and we stretched for a few minutes and then we went for a run. She told me about things with Doofy and how she felt about it and I told her not to worry and that she knows Deb and I would be there for her unconditionaly. It's just so strange they aren't together any more. It's like when I was told my whole world came crumbling down, like... hell was cold, pigs flew past the window, and there was mooing outside (the cows came home, GO COWS!, sorry quick South Park refrence). I kinda know what EZ was goin through, and then that douche bag e-mailing her. God... hes so gay... I just hope this week is like the beautiful sky after a storm or something. Last week was just like the week from hell. I was in a mood, me and Mick kinda snipped at each other now and then, I broke myself, Mick's not feelin well, the age of Eirca-and-Doofy came to an end, and to top it off... Midterms. I was also thinking of my non-existant writing carreer. I always loved it, but I mean... so many people do it better ya know? And I really don't have any good ideas for a good story. I mean, I wanna be like Tolkien ya know? I wanna create my own world. One in which I can twerk and tweak and make my own and I want people to read about it's epic battles and I want what I write to live forever, way past when I'm gone.   x0x
