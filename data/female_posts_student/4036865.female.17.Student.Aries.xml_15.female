Since Kyle left this afternoon to camp, im going to really miss that, it's one of my favorite parts of the day. i get to take care of his lizard this week, im gonna try and make it nice, so its not mean and bites people, i dont like his lizard much. My back is so incredibly sore today:( But, other then that, today was pretty good, all in all. But, im getting bored of writing so i'm gonna go.
