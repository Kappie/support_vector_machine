The first week, in Scotland, was exhausting :) We saw a lot of my Aunt Jean  Uncle Roddy, with their kids: Alison (8), Ross (5) and Jamie (2). (A LOT of  urlLink free  babysitting). Don't get me wrong, they're great kids, but all day, almost every day, of, "Lindsey, Lindsey, Lindsey, can we have another race?". We saw all the relatives: grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and 2nd cousins (two 2-year olds). I  urlLink love  my grandparents'  urlLink house  tho, a great big victorian  urlLink house  :) Very authentic.  We then went to Ipswich in East Anglia and stayed with my uncle Rodney  aunt Tracey. Their two boys are Howard (18) and Freddy (17) - yes Libby they are both quite good looking young men (or so my  urlLink friends  have told me) (Howard's off to Nottingham Uni to study Mathematics this october! :) But another four days of my brother, freddy and howard...(aaaaaaahhh!) I do have some amusing  urlLink video  footage of them doing wacky dives into their outdoor pool (Yes, we went swimming in their open-air outdoor swimming pool, in ENGLAND!) (They also have a  urlLink tennis  court). Its unfair tho, because I'm older than Freddy, and he's driving because in the UK you can get your licence at 17, and I can't drive yet :P Oh well. We saw the Bourne Supremacy, which wasn't as godo as the first one, but still was quite seat-gripping. So yes, I am glad to be  urlLink home , although th Evans' have been house-sitting and won't be leaving until Wednesday.  Tomorrow will be Lindsey Recover Day, Do Homework day (because I have done absolutely nothing, apart from manage to leave my copy of Othello in the rental car), and then I'll be working in the Hopsital on Tuesday  Wednesday, then babysitting for Cathy Thursday  Friday I think. :) Busy busy busy!
