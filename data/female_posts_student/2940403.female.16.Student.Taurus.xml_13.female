I guess I'm lucky that Mr Pellant hasn't assigned a seating chart, yet, for me yelling at him yesterday for not letting me sit where I want.  Here's the story.  I was working, like I usually do, but Amanda was talking to Alicia, and Amanda is the only reason I sit where I do (we can pick our seats).  So I moved over to sit next to Brad and Bez, but Pellant starting saying that I couldnt sit there, saying I would be too much of a distraction.  Not like they do their fucking work anyway!!!  So then I yelled at him, and he said he'd make assigned seats.  Then Keri Dowzak started bitching (like she usually does), so she now obviously hates me.  Good.  My appointment today was boring.  My mom came in with me and we yelled at each other about how we see our relationships with Ellie and who was right and who was wrong.  I say we just make her move out and problem solved.  Too bad we can't do that.  We also went over what could be the cause of my horrible mood swings.  They keep asking me if it's my mom's breast cancer a year ago, why would that have anything to do with it?  Just lots of stupid things like that.  I got Wendy's afterwards :)  My frosty made everyone jealous.  I fell asleep in science twice today.  Eric kept touching my shoulder to keep me awake.  Ass. :(  I'm in a bad mood again... I think I'm going to go take a nap
