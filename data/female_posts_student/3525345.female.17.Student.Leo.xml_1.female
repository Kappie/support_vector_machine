I came up with a list of them so I thought I'd like to share them with all of you.   Up: I do not have to watch my annoying little brother today Downside: I still have to watch my annoying little sister which is *way* more annyoing than him  Up: We put a contract on a house in Washington Downside: We still don't know if we got it or not and we have no way of figuring out anytime soon because our stupid phone isn't working  Up: My leg hurts..wait a second thats not a good thing..next!  Up: I get paid today!!  Downside: I have to give my paycheck to my dad to pay him back for all the money he's lent me for the past 3 million years :P  Up: Today Jimmy and I have been going out for 7 months Happy anniversary Jimmy! Downside: Theres really no downside to that :)  Hehe well that pretty much sums it up for now! Later.
