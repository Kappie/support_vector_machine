Just recently, i just found out that as far as I am concerned..shopping has healing powers. Believe me, I went shopping a week before my prelims exams with a temperature of 38 degrees...and guess what.. i became so healthy afterwards that I was able to answer all the questions in all my 7 exams. must be the endorphins that got crazy all over my body, the exercise that comes with walking for two hours going through racks after racks of mass produced merchandise..well, that or i just need psychiatric help for being so "angry" with money that I can't stand it bein with me..for a week.   so without further delay or as good writers would put it.. much ado (yeah whatever)..here are my confessions and escapades as a (now) CHRONIC SHOPAHOLIC:  1. I refer to Carrie Bradshaw like a person who truly exists..and someone who is close to me. I can't, for the life of me, remember what Condoleeza Rice's occupation is or her place in Bush's government.. but I am poud to say that Carrie is a writer of a sex column who loves shoes (Manolos and Choos), she has dated a musician and the two of her loves are Mr. Big and Aidan. she also can't bear to leave NY much less see other people do it, coz New York City--is the CITY..and her fashion acquisitions are her financial investments to date.   2. This is how I pray:  "Dear God, thank you for all the blessings. You really love me. Im sorry for acting like a spoiled brat sometimes..ok half the time..promise ill make up for it..in the future. Please guide me, esp with my studies.. take care of my family, my friends, everybody in school and the whole world.. even those who hate me..  And God, please help me in my pursuit to become a size 0 so I can fit in those Roberto Cavalli dresses and Tyler pants (with the air) when I can I finally afford them or have come up with a flat 1 average and bribe my parents with it. Thank you God, i love you."  3. I silently contemplate suicide whenever a person does not know what DKNY stands for or the difference bet suede and velvet.   4. I stay up late just watching Fashion Television. U think women walking up and down the ramp is boring? Well, what do u make out of watching races joined by schumacher..he wins all the time, its no contest! let it go.   lets all watch fashion television and will shud be inspired by karen's penchant for designer clothes..so we wudnt look the same all the freaking time.  5. I think Coco Chanel is a hero.  6. The number of fashion magazines (Cosmo, et al) i have can successfully burn our house in a minute when u light them up.   7. The wrong color of socks can make or break a guy's outfit and the wrong shade of stockings can destroy a woman's reputation. I don't need to wear stockings, thankyouverymuch!  8. I get sad when I don't get to buy anything. As in depressed.  9. I enjoy reading Oscar Wilde..and those fashion critic's articles about every fashion show here or otherwise.  10. And lastly.. I keep every paper bag of the diff stores...as remembrance.
