So... we hung out at my bar (of course 'cause the drinks are cheap and the ppl are hillarious) and then we went to see Miss Katie at the titty bar :D Saturday was a good day too... went out to Brighton- got to spend time with some of my favorite friends, just hanging out. And then I got to go cook dinner at a friend's house- made some kickass lasagne for them, then I altered my mood a little bit and headed for the movies. Oh- let us not forget, the lady called about the karaoke contest- which is TODAY, so I'm all nervous about that. But it's 200 bucks in my hand. So we go to see Harrold and Kumar Go To White Castle's and i'm laughin my ass off. We get to the bar- Les's 21st birthday and so things are all crazy and out of control.... man it's just awesome. So I get home and there's a letter from my favorite jailbird... I dont know where this is going to go, but right now his ideas kinda rock... and we're good friends so things could be great if they ever went anywhere. Fuck the 4 page letter- it was six pages long. So by the time Sunday rolled around, and I got to sleep in waaay late which never happens for me, let me tell ya, I'm feeling just awesome. We cooked out and had ppl over and things were just wonderful. Then I got my horoscope- "Remember how hard things used to seem? Thank goodness that phase has passed." Then I got to hang out with TJ like he said we were gonna on top of that too.... And I couldnt even force myself to care about what was going on hundreds of miles away from me not even for one second. Actually, I'm over it... and I am glad that someone is happy and that I can move on and be happy too. :D Besides, my life is a little more interesting than his. I think that finding someone who loves me the way that he did will be that much easier because he's with someone now... I like that. And maybe I'll find someone who likes my lifestyle and lives it too... who knows? I guess I'll find out huh? Right now, life is seeming pretty great. Maybe I'm over it 'cause I still cant get upset now no matter how hard I try. I gotta go- write more later after class :D
