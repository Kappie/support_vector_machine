Which would have been 8 or 8:30...  and now it is 12:11, so I am doubting that he is going to call.  :-(  Which sucks cause I really wanted to hang out tonight with him.  But I guess this means that I get to go to bed a little earlier than normal tonight.  Cause I need to catch up on some sleep and make my headache go away.  I have had one all night.  Errrrrrrr.  I have to work tomorrow... cashier for once, wow.  2:30-6:00, no break.. not even worth my time to come in at all.  O well.  Well... maybe I will get to talk to Nick tomorrow.  Who knows.
