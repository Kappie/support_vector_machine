She made me so happy and I guess now, a part of the happiness I had when she was alive is gone. I used to be so funny and now im..not. I wish this didnt happen but I cant help it and I wish my funniness would come back. But then again some of it could just be me changing because i am getting older...I had just turned 14 when i wrote those and im about to turn 16 in 3 months. hmm  My sisters wedding is in 4 days. All the family is coming down from NJ and im so happy...  Janet, do you read this? I hate talking to myself lol
