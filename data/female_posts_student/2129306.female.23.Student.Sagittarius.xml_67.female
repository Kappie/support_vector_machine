I think it's stress. 5) Certain people like to complain, a lot.  They complain without thinking about all that they have to be thankful for. 6) I like Springfield-but I am stressed out right now and sometimes I long for the simple days when all we had to worry about was where we were going to go on Wednesday night, and what we wanted to drink.  (Simple:  White Horse, and R Pitchers) 7) I wish my Chambana friends still got along.  I don't see them nearly enough as it is, and this whole nonsense of inviting them to visit in shifts (at least the CR gang) is highly annoying.  8) I can't wait to move off campus.  One of my roommates is so anal about cleanliness (I like it to be clean-but she goes overboard) that we can barely breathe w/o her spraying lysol everywhere. Seriously.   That's enough out of me for now.  I'm off to class.  More later.
