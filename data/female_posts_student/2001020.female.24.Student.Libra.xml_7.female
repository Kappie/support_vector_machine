I had this faith that nothing could shake, no matter how many times the phone should've rang and didn't. You had this way of piercing through my cynicism and my agonized past to make me believe in you. I put you on a pedestal so high that I didn't mind that you blocked my view of the sky. But then I couldn't see you falling from that great height until you were at my feet in a crumpled heap. At first, I wasn't sure it was you because, well, I though I knew all about you. You reached out your hand, and I wanted to save you but you were so far from what I wanted anymore that I held you and held you... and finally, I turned my back and walked away. I could've taken you along but there wasn't enough room for the two of us on this path I chose.
