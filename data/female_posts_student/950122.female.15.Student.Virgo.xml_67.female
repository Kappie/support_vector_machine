Actually, we arrived this morning at like 2:50, and I didn't fall asleep until around 3-4. And that was after a 9 hour drive with three people in the back with me.. Not exactly the most comfortable trip I've been on..  Anyway, New Years was ok. Tristan moped the most. Agh, it was so thing.. I didn't know what to say to him because I didn't know what he could do. I hate it when people bury themselves in depression. We didn't have any fireworks. Nor any torotots. We had a quiet New Years. And it was quite boring. We had dinner with the family at my Lola's house, but only my younger cousins and I stayed up to greet the new year. I wore stripes and jumped as much as I could. n_n;;   While I was in the province, I got my prom dress altered for only 50 pesos. 0_o That's less than a dollar. I also found a comfortable pair of prom-able shoes. So now all I need is a small bag and a shawl. But my mom wants me to wear a boa instead of a shawl. 0_o I guess that would be ok.. I'd have to see it first. n_n;;  Not much happened in the past week. Just played RO and was lazy.. n_n;; Eck, I'll post tomorrow. I've got school tomorrow.. > I hope they don't show us our test results. I might die of a heart attack.
