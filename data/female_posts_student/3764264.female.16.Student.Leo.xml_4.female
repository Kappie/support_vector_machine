I'm not talking about advertisements and mainstream, newsroom, Iraq, Bush, Spears, hate crimes, terrorism, celebrity nonsense rhymes. Media, in the rawest sense of the word. A transfer of thought. The transfer of a feeling.      To people.   To a person.   To me.       Art. The thought that reality is only perception. The feeling that I'm not alone in my struggle with acceptance of this society. But then what is reality? Or perhaps I should say what is my reality? Perception is such a difficult thing to understand.       Am I in love because I wish to be in love? Or that I perceive myself to be, thus I am? Am I really in that much control? And who is in control of what I perceive?       I'm getting goosebumps.    My glass of milk is almost empty.   Theres a bible in front of me.    I was the last person to touch that pen.    My legs are crossed.    I think I've gained weight.       What the fuck is happening with me? What question do I want an answer to? What am I searching for?       ..... And I suppose the ultimate question of my young life is overpowering that question. What do I want to become? What am I searching for?      Sage
