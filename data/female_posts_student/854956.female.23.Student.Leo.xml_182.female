Anyhow, then I went to lunch after class, and decided to eat at Chick-fil-A.  It's all Ricky's fault because he kept saying, "It's like a little piece of Jesus with every bite."  So, I was craving some, and there I ended up on Monday.  Whilst I was there, I decided to get some science reading in since I wasn't really paying attention in class and I had time to kill before work.  And when I look up I see a rather familiar guy going to sit down.  It was Greg.  He then joined me and we had a bit of a chat about work stuff.  It was neat to hang out... however, I don't think we should do it again.  He goes on for hours about hanging out with me to everyone else.  For the next few hours at work he kept saying, "Me and Kels ate lunch together today!  We had a BLAST!"  And I'd say, "Well... I ate, then he came, and HE ate lunch while I sat there and talked to him..."  He's funny.  Okay, Tuesday flew by... Wednesday flew by... today flew by because I accidentally slept through my alarm clock.  :-(  Ooops.  Then all I had was work.  This weekend should be fun.  I'm going to Mr. Sinus with Melissa and Ricky... and maybe others?  It's Pretty In Pink... makes me think of lipstick... hmmmm.  Anyhoo... that's all for now... maybe more later... :-P
