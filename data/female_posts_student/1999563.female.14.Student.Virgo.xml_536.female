I just got done cleaning the hosue when my neighbor calls and was like "Can you baby sit tonight from 7-10?" and I was like "Ok!" because any oppurtunity to make money is well worth the pain. One of the kids is named "Lincoln"  :) I can tell right now he is going to be like the most popular boy in high school. He has diry blonde hair and blue eyes. Even though he is only 1 years old, he is going to be a pretty boy. :) 16 years in the future, correct me if I am wrong. :)  The second of the two children is named Lanie. She always makes me laugh. one time we played house and she named her husband "Spider Man" it was funny :)  She is obessed with disney land. She is always like "Lets go to Disney land!!" and I am like "But....it's in california!" "Noooooooo!! we are gonna pretend!" :)  Last time I baby sat them Lincoln would not stop crying. It was soo messed up. I did every single thing to try to get him to be quite but he wouldn't! Then at his bed time I put him in bed and he just fell right asleep..I was like, "grrrr... why didn't I do this sooner?"  Kids...ay yi yi!  I am never ever having children, to much work!!  I would rather live by myself in a flat in London. :)
