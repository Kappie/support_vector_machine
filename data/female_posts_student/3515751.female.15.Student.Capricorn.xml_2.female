That was part of my prayer to God…I really don’t know but it was exactly how I felt at that moment…last year, something like that happen also and I really had a hard time through it…I had a few people help me up and I found my way again. But this year, I really don’t want to disturb anyone…and if God really is real, He will bring me home. That’s all I know. this year, I’m having PMR and many are having SPM…I really don’t want to disturb any of them…I know that somehow…somehow…everything would be fine…I hope…I’ve been really worried…I really don’t know…and I dunno what to do now…just sit down and wait…I’ve seek for Him for 15 years already…and I really have no strength anymore…coz I know that no matter how I seek for Him but if He doesn’t draw me back…there’s no use and I’m starting to give up…I dunno…I really don’t know…Love, Dunno…
