Now it's ALL deleted and I am left with NOTHING. NOTHING. crying. I am crying inside. I feel so betrayed by this computer. Ah, if only my laptop had internetnow. I'll bet IT doesn't want to spite me. Yes, I am talking to you, other computer. FUCK YOU. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Why'd you have to leave my lj and me! I HATE YOU! tee hee. Okay, I'm going to go do something REALLY interesting. And by interesting, I mean "brain numbingly boring" but shh. Let's make believe I have a stellar eventful life. Actually, I have a show tonight, which is cool. Eek, spider. I do not like spiders. Not even the little ones. Especially not the little ones that can jump. Ugh *shudders*. I would write now, but I'm no longer in the mood. *mutters* fucking norton.
