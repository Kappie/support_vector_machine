       
      A particularly cruel (but not so unique) twist in the affirmative action debate - a student of Michigan State University is actually  urlLink called out ,  in front of her whole class , by the professor for writing a letter to the school paper expressing her opposition to affirmative action.  Check the link (courtesy of  urlLink Andrew Sullivan ) for comments of support.  I posted one myself (not because I'm necessarily against affirmative action), but I am mainly appalled that someone who supports affirmative action would excoriate a student for expressing her opinion on  any  subject when one of the main justifications (and a noble one, I might add)  for  affirmative action is the diversity of ideas that is beneficial to the collegiate experience.  It is a strange atmosphere for diversity indeed when one must agree with everything the prof says for fear of getting reamed in class for disagreement.
