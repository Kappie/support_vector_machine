How long a minute is depends on what side of the bathroom door you're on.   Birthdays are good for you; the more you have, the longer you live.   Happiness comes through doors you didn't even know you left open.   Ever notice that the people who are late are often much jollier than the people who have to wait for them?   You may be only one person in the world, but you may also be the world to one person.   Some mistakes are too much fun to only make once.   Don't cry because it's over; smile because it happened.   A truly happy person is one who can enjoy the scenery on a detour.   Have an awesome day, and know that someone who thinks you're great has thought about you today!..   "And that person was me."..... Please don't keep this message to yourself.....send it to those who mean so much to you.... "NOW"....    urlLink Sticker   urlLink print .
