But since I don't really have much of a choice on that score, I should probably spend the rest of today getting as close to ready to do so as I can.  I have a little residuals of sickness - like my constantly needing to be blown nose - but otherwise I'm feeling better, if not great.  I have still been sleeping lots in hopes that the sickness will not return, but I do not think it will at this stage.    Now that it is March, this is when things get (or should get) really serious with school.  Like today, I have many things I need to do, and will begin doing as soon as I finish this.  No matter how much I get done, I always think it is never enough.  This weekend it is especially not enough, since I am so behind from missing most of last week.  But everything will be okay.  I had a dream last night that I had a class that I had completely forgotten about and had neglected to attend the classes all semester.  I've had this dream at least once before.    Well, it's off for a day of work, then perhaps a slight relaxation by 8 PM - and then it's to bed to let the week truly begin.
