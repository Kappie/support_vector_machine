Anywya, Jo's party was brill last night, it was a proper house party (ie parents cleared out and we had the run of the downstairs etc and the garden), and all in all it was a good laugh! Today I went to work and i've been on my feet all day, they are aching sooooo much! There is sod all on the tv tonight apart from the Euroviaion thing that I WON'T  be watching, especailly as those gay Russian girls are singing. And of course dad is so busy cementing the patio he can't go out to blockbusters, so it looks like I'm going to be reduced to doing some revision tonight. How marvellous. Anyway, cya later guys
