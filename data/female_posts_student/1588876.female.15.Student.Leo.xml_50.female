Today, my stupid-tendencies caught up with me.  it started yesterday when i was walking to my bus stop with Ruby after school. she said, "hey, bobby got your little message." "uh..what?!" "yeah. he wrote back 'haha addy. i know its you. i know the addinator.' "  i asked her how he found out it was me.  "he tricked me. he just asked who calls him the bobbinator and i said Addie."  i guess she didnt know he was reading his desk. it turns out he saw what i wrote on his desk on tuesday. i had written "i (heart) the bobbinator" Madeline and i were just writing random things on desks like "i (heart) money" and "i own you". i thought it would be funny if i wrote "i (heart) the bobbinator on his desk. i changed my writing and everything. i knew he had Shapiro 3rd period- right before me b/c i have it 4th. so anyhoo, i was talking to rubes and i was like, "oh crap!!!" and i was freaking out. but hten i thought to myself, "wait, he knows my name, but can he place aface? no way- ruby would never point me out." so sarah, madeline, ceilidh, and i decided that around bobby, will, and wills friends, and at school, i would take on the alias: "Gretchen" ruby suggested that if a last name is in question, i take on the alias "Gretchen Ross" Yes. like the girl in Donny Darko. well it turned out i was right-   ruby   wouldnt point me out.  so then it was today. i went into geometry and went to his desk and saw where he had written back. i wrote back "dammit, i tried to change my writing and everything." and only a few minutes later when class was just about to start, sarah- who sits in front of me- says, "um...theres someone at the door for you....?" and she points to the door. i look over and to my utter surprise, i see wesley merritt (ceilidh's bro's friend), a few other guys, and- oh yes...a real shocker- bobby. they were yelling and laughing and pointing and screaming. i see wesely above the rest pointing me out to everyone going "thats her!! right there!! thats her!! thats her!!!!" my face got all red and i felt like i was about to explode. i was laughing out of my sheer embarrassment but was saying, "holy shit! oh my god! oh my god!"  how did he know who i was? he only saw me once when he and i spent the night and the nichols' place (he with will, and i with ceilidh and sarah). we dont know eachother! how did he know who i was? maybe this was payback for the harrassment that took place when he fell asleep on the recliner that night. that was funny.  but anyway...yeah- they were all laughing at me and madeline who sits next to me was cracking up saying "hahahahahahaha! i cant believe they did that! hahahahaha!" i think they may freaked out mr. shapiro too. i'd be confused too if a gang of kids were at my door poiting and yelling at one of my students for no reason i know of. god that was so embarrassing. i actually started shaking. im such a dumbass. i thik i'll just avoid those guys on monday. too bad bobby cant even spell my name right. oh well. common mistake.  drama drama drama.
