And speaking of god...Abby is fricking pwning that right hand and shall be pwning the left in due time. It's only the most complicated thing I've ever heard in the span of sixteen years....that's why I'm a rap-rock guitarist.    Speaking of thorazine....everyone, find me some before I murder my English teacher in ice cold blood. She makes me want to set myself on fire...well, no. She more make me want to set her on fire.  And for those of you that don't know, I'm under suspicion of plagarism because my writing in one paper is "not like the others," and my speech was "antiquated". What the hell?!? Somebody must not be reading my schtick very well. And anyway, since her stupid "find me a cheater" machine didn't turn anything up, *the bird*. I really don't even see where she has the right to say that...as if I care. I'm just there for the grade. Bottom line is:  I  wrote it, so  fuck this .  Yeh I'm pissed. This is the second time this has happened to me, and last time I was the one leaving with a black eye...three of them, numerically. But I passed that class and by the good lordy if I don't pass this one and laugh my ass off when I do.  RRAUGH. Done.
