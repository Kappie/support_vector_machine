We had church in the morning as always, but it was kinda fun to be back after my five week absence.  Then we went home and slept for a really long time.  Sleep is mucho good.  And this was a Breathe week, so practice was at 6:30, and we had a new member of the tech team.  A male version of Leila.  We're going to call him Leeland.  He actually knows alot more about computers than me which was very good when I couldn't get the computer monitor on unless I pushed the button and held it in.  So he stuck a paperclip in it and now it works fine.  And so go the normal fixes in the tech room.  I think he could be a valuable asset to the team.   So today is the last day of Pennsylvania cousins, they are leaving on a jet plane in a couple of hours.  Sadly I actually got to know all of them pretty well this summer, but I won't see them again for proably a year or more.  Oh well that's how relatives are.     Oh and get this, one of the ladies in our church came up to me and asked me "Amanda, how was your trip."  and I was like, you know my name?  Are you feeling alright?  You see at my church all the senile people have a very hard time keeping Wonder Woman and I seperate.  Wonder Woman sings on the worship team, so they see her every sunday.  I however am in the back in the Tech room, so they don't see me.  We've become known as the Callihan girl.  People come up to me after church, and say you did such a nice job singing today.  Now originally I would correct people, but it took so long to explain that now I just say thanks.  And before I left people would come up to Wonder woman and say I have things for you, but I forgot them at home.  And she'd look at them and say things?  You know, for your trip.  And she'd said oh, great. So now we answer for each other, it's just too complicated the other way.  Although they are going to be very surprised when Wonder Woman sundenly stops singing on the worship team, and flys back from California every weekend.  Oh well.   I have to run though.  I have an orthodontist appointment in Great Spoons in a little bit, Oh joy.  I'll talk more later.
