One day that cat is gonna come back and haunt me. I didnt mean exacly to put her in the middle of the surfbourd in the middle of the pool-it was an accident, i say!! ehe! What is with the song 'left outside alone'. Everyone is singing it! It's not that good. It sounds almost classical at the start. I hate classical music. I wish all the old classical singers could crawl up next to my dead cat and die. Excellent...! Either that or b burried alive. OMG~ !! I saw a Big Brother add, that said Miriam (the he-she) was gonna go into the Big Brother house. They r so desperate. Ne ways i bettr go do sumthing __________.     Luv Kc PS. the title of this post sounds like im an alcoholic! eh?
