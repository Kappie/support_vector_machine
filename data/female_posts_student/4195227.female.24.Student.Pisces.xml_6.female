Some of my previous moves were intended to avoid those who actually know me face to face...or more particularly a close friend who read my blog with religious ferver and with whom I never had anything to talk about for that reason! She always already knew my news! How annoying. And then she got mad at ME for not having anything to say when we talked! Of all the bloody cheek! I have also learned that it is useful to NOT use real names to refer to people in one's blog, as they can frequently be misinterpreted (lack of vocal tone and all that). Not that I expect anyone to track me down here and actually pick ME out of the thousands of other journalers unless I intend for them to. I simply enjoy putting my thoughts out into the void for other anonymous souls to read and enjoy should they so choose.    My screenname originates from my favorite season of the year, my comfor time, and from "adytum", which is a new word I've discovered that aptly captures the feeling I have toward journaling.  It means "the innermost sanctum of an ancient temple whence oracles were given."  So welcome to my innermost sanctum.  Yours, Maggie
