It seems so long since Monday came along and now it has surely been a very slow week and stuff but its almost Friday right??  Okay cool because since tomorrow is Friday and Monday was about three weeks back, why does it seem to have a long time lapse in between??? Maybe it because summer is suppose to be warm, sunny and care free. Where as right now, well not right now because the sun is out, we have had three days of straight cold and rain, and plus early mornings... The whole prospect of school right now seems very ... Not relaxing, nor is it any fun like a summer day is suppose to be.  anyway now that, that is done. I should go study, but as you all know I'm not going to go study. I'm actually probably going to go and I don't know, do something else...
