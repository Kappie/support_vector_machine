But whoever is writing this stuff I strongly disagree with. So I decided to write my own review.    Point A: They assume people do not use discernment.   This publication subscribes to the same way of thinking as the people who think if I play Doom and listen to Drowning Pool it is going to cause me to go out and kill people and enjoy it. It's utterly ludicrious. If you are going to tell me that then you also have to say that your children are only Christians because you tell them it is a good thing and make them go to church every sunday.  Hello? God gave people an internal locos of control. It's called "Free Will".  If I as a teenage Christian cannot go see " urlLink the Italian Job " without becoming corrupted and deciding that being a criminal is a good thing (because I am a stupid internalizing dim-wit teenager), then how in the ************* can Christianity still exist today!?  Your reaction when you intake **anything** in this world are decided by YOU and who you ALREADY ARE. Forgive me if my Worldview encompasses more then just whatever is on the exclusive Christian market, but anything and everything of this world, if perceived wisely, reveils God's truth because it is the ultimate truth and it is unescapible.    Point B: They are biased beyond Biblical standards.   Addressing the very first paragraph: They praise Creed and don't even mention when they use rape as a metaphore for intellectual/emotional abuse in "Beautiful" but assume that Nirvana is being literal when they sing about it. Funny how this reviewer is willing to do research behind questionable Relient K songs but doesn't do  crap  (oh no! heaven forgive me! I mean "c***") to find out what Kurt Cobain is talking about in his song.  'Worse yet, "Rape Me" is destined to be  an accessory in violent crimes against women by suggesting that they enjoy being sexually assaulted-repeatedly  ("Rape me my friend . . . hate me, do it and do it again"). Tongue in cheek? Hard to tell. It will be interesting to see how the band tries to justify this one.' - Bob Waliszewski  Kurt said in an interview the song was responding to the bands that were copying Nirvana's style and then debasing Nirvana. Thats what he was saying. Creed used rape to describe a feeling of rejection "The Beautiful raped me, raped me, raped me." And if you ask me, beauty (coinciding with order) is more of an institution of God then social slander.  Either way, they either have condemn both or allow for both, but to not even mention the Creed one is simply odd.  Keep in mind though that  none of the above ever suggests that rape is a good thing , in fact, they use it as an illustration only because everyone knows its abominable and horrible, along with genocide and crusifixion and whatever else. If it's wrong to merely mention rape, then why is it still in the Old Testiment?  It makes me wonder how Plugged In would review the Bible.   I remember (I believe it's in Judges?) reading about a mob which surrounds this guy's house and busts on the door, so the owner of the house throws his daughter out there to pacify them and  they rape her until she's dead . Then the owner the next morning, in protest,  chops her up into several pieces  and sents one piece to each of the Tribes of israel. So they are all understandablely miffed about it and grab their swords and slay everyone (disemboulment anyone?) in the town and burn the whole place down destruction style. Plugged In would condemn this story if it were not already in Biblical context.  How about Song of Solomon? The book is sexually explicit. It does not talk about procreation and obeying the first commandment given (go forth and multiply), it simply talks about the enjoyment factor of sex and pining for it with your partner.  The Psalms are full of conflict, hardship and prayers for protection and that God would strike down and annihilate enemies. Job mourns for who knows how long over what has already past (he is a HUMAN), and every person (aside from Jesus) in the Bible disobeys God time and time again. If I were to review this all "Plugged In" style I would say this:  Pro-social Content: Shows nature of God, explains salvation and identifies love as very importent. Several stories which inspire insight and perserverence.  Objectible Content: Innumerable sins including: murder, rape, genocide wrought by the armies of God, hate for God, sexual inmorality of every fashion (beastiality, orgies and homosexual) disobedience, slavery, the breaking of every commandment, pillaging, tortures and general displays of the carnal depravity of mankind. Strung with universal conflicts needing a solution humanity fails to use to be resolved. Several references to Satan himself and Satanism, witchcraft, demonic occurances of several types, necromancy and the summoning of spirits and the dead by God-fearing men.   Conclusion: A very mixed bag. Not suggested for the children of the family or anyone sensitive to change or uncomfortable material.    My point here is that its not the material which has the influence, its how you assess it and how you "plug it" into what you already know. Reading a book on Nazi rhetoric can either strengthen what you already believe about God or bend you in another direction, depending on  who you already  are. Likewise CS Lewis could have the same two affects on an Athiest.  Hence, there are people out there who should not expose themselves to certain things if they are easily seduced and/or lose control. God knows your weaknesses, so  its very wise to follow your personal convictions , but to draw a line between black and white on what material is always good and always evil is foolish.  Consider an Axe. It is a neutral object. You can use it to make firewood with and stay warm, or you could murder someone with it. Either way, the axe is just an axe. The sin or goodness is born and carried out in the person, and no two people are exactly the same.  Some material causes the same God-seperating reaction in all people, and therefor God has told everyone to not partake as it is harmful. Pornography for example, although the boundries for what is pornographic and what is not is mostly determined by the society you grow up in. Our standards should be more oriented on Biblical Standards and less on the generic cliche's of what our society has deemed wrong for itself.   Why is "shit" offensive when the word "poo poo" makes people giggle. There is NO difference between them and what they mean besides what people have been told is more-wrong. Intercourse/"making love" is a respectful term for sex, while f***ing implies exactly the same thing and makes cetain people gasp. A dork is short for:  "Slang. A stupid, inept, or foolish person: “the stupid antics of America's favorite teen-age cartoon dorks” (Joshua Mooney). Vulgar Slang. The penis."  Dork then is in actaulity a hateful vulgar word. Follow the rules and what-have-you, but realize its all the same whether you excuse it or not, the difference is whether or not you choose to be offended- or whether you examine the actual attitude and intention behind the person communicating it.   Anger is anger, whether or not you cuss someone out with big words or little ones. Saying a mere "Good Heavens" by using logic dilutes the reverence behind the holy institution of God's throne. With the same logic you can see why words which represent sex, another holy institution, are all one and the same, but realize the words have nothing to do with it- its the use of them. Some words have become interchangable with certain uses of the meaning, which is unfortunate in my opinion because it makes things more complex then they need to be.   This all is why I think God cares more about the condition of your heart then the motions you choose to go through. The rough edges get smoothened out if you want them to anyway.    Point C: They are uninformed and pre-judgemental   Below is what this author says about The Colour and the Shape. Following that is what I see it as.  'Whining self-destructiveness and misery dominate "My Poor Brain." On "Everlong," the artist is invited to "waste away" with a woman of questionable sanity. Though  vague , "Monkey Wrench"  could be interpreted  as the frustrations of a teen whose parents refuse to accept his homosexuality.'  So Dave Grohl's best friend commits suiscide, he moves halfway across the country, his wife later leaves him and he doesn't know Jesus and he's not allowed to have one "miserable" song on the album? Job got pretty miserable for awhile too, blame the fall of mankind for misery, not Dave Grohl. It happens to everyone. The song even states "Sometimes I wish that I could change/I can't save you from my poor brain". It's about past baggage hindering his relations with people.  Everlong is a love song which uses the joy making music with someone to describe the emotional aspects of the exchanges that go on during a relationship. You can interpret "waste away" in any way you want to drive a point across; thats ultimately up to the listener (or reader, the the reviewers case). I personally see it as living to the end of his life. Assuming it is sex, I imagine he was writing it about his  WIFE  of the time, which never was a bad thing. And nowhere is her sanity mentioned, unless he's just suggesting she'd have to be half crazy to go for Dave.  Dave Grohl said in an interview I read Monkey Wrench was about a dysfuctional relationship. Maybe Dave's lieing, but either way I after reading back through the lyrics the only connection I can make between the song and homosexuals is when he says "one in ten" which this reviewer probably assumed refers to the incorrect statistic of 1 in 10 men being gay. That is like taking a single scripture and building your own cult, it doesn't work as its incongruent with the rest of the song, its a real stretch.   Assuming he is correct (which he is not), I do not see how the conflicts and confusion around the issue of homosexuality is an illegitimate frustration, moreover why the topic itself is objectible when this song neither justifies it or condemns it (probably because thats not what its about).  On another album they place two songs under "Objectible Content", Halo and Come Back. The Chorus of Halo is "Halo/God only knows/right behind me everywhere I go". I like this song, because it reminds me of the spiritual protection God gives and it's apparent even to a non-Christian. They dismiss this song because of an f word used in the context of "messing up".  ------- halo God only knows right behind me everywhere I go  say your prayers when you get scared you pray you're gonna make it and then when you're done you keep f****** up (everyone has done this) one day soon I'll disappear (die) and if you'll come I'll take you somewhere to go  to keep from growing old (Heaven) disappear the light is breaking disappear outside their range disappear I'm tired of waiting disappear before we fade away (Death) -------  That is their decision. In "Come Back" I think Dave's talking about not giving up on someone.  ------- moving again comfort of the chase (keeping busy with purpose is comforting) now and again this my saving grace (purpose is a grace of God) dead on the inside I've got nothing to prove (I see this as being dead to one's own desires and giving up pride) keep me alive and give me something to lose (thanking God for life but realizing the temperal state it is, concerning materialism) goodbye this time I'm leaving you I've been gone so long so gone so long but I will come back changes changing back and forth again trading places strangers in the end I will come back for you --------  You could interpret the last part of the song however you wish. The reveiwers did not even try. It could make you think of Christ returning, it could make you think of returning to Christ, it could make you think of anything you associate it with, but for me it makes me think of not giving up on someone no matter what has happened or will happen.    Point D: They are uninformitive.   Calling it a review of music would be incorrect, as nowhere in any review I've read do they specifically address the music itself. They address the lyrics, period stop. Sometimes you'll find the word "edgy" or "upbeat", but thats less then you'll get from the guy standing at the counter in Wal-Mart. I'm not even convinced that these people are required to listen to the music, if they are they don't mention it... and since half the meaning of music is translated through the INSTRUMENTS these reviews do not give you the whole value of what is being discussed.   Any authority that would call  Smashmouth  a varient of  Punk  is hardly an authority at all in my opinion. They also suggest Creed's "Weathered" as "a good mainstream alternative to the likes of Korn, Staind and Drowning Pool." I apologize, but thats like telling a Cannible Corpse fan to listen to Kenny G, they are nowhere near like each other.  Whatever the case the reviews are literalists, which does not mix well with music unless you listen to Pop or Country. Which is amusing, because those two genre's fair the best. Aaron Carter sings about doing his chores, and he gets a good score. When they are not sure what to think, they tend to give leniency to whom they so choose.    The Conclusion of MY Review   Not only is it unbiblical to expect a corrupted world to live up to the higher standard without the aid or reason or motivation of a personal relationship with God, but it is also ungraceful. It is even more strange to condemn the fruits of this world and seek alienation, as I believe God is capible of supplying wisdom and insight through anything- esspecially the places we must live in and interact with. I believe that understanding these people, which by the definition of the world are more normal by human standards, does not mean you also have to agree with them and/or condone their behavior and/or sacrifice a goat in your backyard.  And I also don't like Plugged In.  The End.   Hey, that was a long post. -------------------------------------------- "There is no man that ever ate, no man that was ever born, no joyous son of king or queen, for whose sake I would do you harm" - the Tain, pre-roman celtic ballad
