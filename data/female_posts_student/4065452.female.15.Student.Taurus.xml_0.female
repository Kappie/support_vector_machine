Ashlie and I worked like... something that works really really hard! (I don't know I am to tired to think!) But yea, the cat house is so HUGE! We still aren't finished with it! We'll finish it tomorrow.  Last night I realized that I had been lied to. And if you know me you know I absolutely HATE being lied too. I have been played. I thought I was smart enough not to be, but as it turns out some players are REALLY good with concealing their motives. But I’m still not upset or mad… I’m just frustrated. I could have been persuing the guy I truly liked instead of wasting my time with a player. But I have a plan… Its going to shock the hell out of this guy! I’m tired of chickening out when I think about doing it. I know I need to do it the next time I see him before it’s too late.   Hmm… I think that is it for today.  Cat
