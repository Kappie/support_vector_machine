     
       Well, I am back from my week in Majorca; tanned (sort of), refreshed and with a rather impressive vocabulary of German swear words, courtesy of water volleyball.  High Point: FÃ¼nfzehn-Null! Leck mich am Arsch!  Low Point: An elderly gentleman approaching me at dinner one evening and saying "I bet you don't recognise me with my clothes on", and me subsequently having to explain to my husband and mother that I'd accidentally knocked on his door thinking it was Mum's room, and he had answered semi-naked thinking I was his wife (as opposed to the "more obvious" explanation).
