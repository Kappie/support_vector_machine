When i was younger i really didnt like who i was, i wanted to be somethiing else or to look like something else. I always wondered why couldnt i have soft and long hair like her, or why couldnt i have hazel eyes, or why it was always me to be the tallest or the biggest one in the class. I was never greatful for what i had, i was never greatful for always making good grades. I' ve done alot of dumb stuff in my short 14 years, i've played around with serious stuff that shouldn't be played with, i never took oppertunities that could have helped me later on. I was never able to accpet myself for who i was i always wanted to be that skinny girl on tv, or that girl who was mixed with something else besides being all african American. I always hated my name and think why couldnt i have a simple name like ashley or jessica. But now as i am maturing mentally ive come to realize that my eye color my height, my weight, my name were all fit for me, god made me not to always be the skinniest or to have the least common name, or to have the nappiest hair, and now i can accept that am i am glad to be that i am glad to be "weird" or to be quiet, or even to be misunderstood. So like it or not because this is who i am.
