Oh, how pathetic we humans are without electricity!  We depend on everything we create and forget our own purpose.  We forget the language of the forest and tongue of true inhabitants of Earth.  We perfect Mother Nature as much as possible when we should stop and listen.  We should stand and embrace the imperfections that surround us.
