Fortunately, tomorrow round 1 of the process will be over, when I turn in my application and materials to UT. (minus the recommendation letters--they should be in sometime early next week)  Round 2 will be the interviews in early October, followed by sending the finished app to New York.  Then there's round 3, where Brazil decides...  Very complicated process, but understandable considering how much money a full Fulbright scholarship is worth.  I'm very excied--I think I have a very good chance of getting it.  But even if I don't, that's ok.  I have several back-up plans.  And I will probably go back to the School of the Future in SÃ£o Paulo to investigate them futher, Fulbright or no.  Today I made the 10,000 mile hike from 23rd and Rio Grande to the Latin American Studies Institute over on Red River (Again. I live there, pretty much).  Seriously.  If I make enough money one day, I'm going to ensure that there's a specific shuttle to that joint.  Of course, this would be the home of my major, the Benson library, my advisors, and all my research.  I'm nodding as I type.  It's definitely time for some much-needed sleep.
