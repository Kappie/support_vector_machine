Having been salvaged from my manhattan apartment.  They still retain the goodness of trick or treating.  Actually, I do believe I tried to pawn them off a year ago as Easter Candy.  Whao! has it been that long?  How about some cheese? This next item up for bid has been rescued for the cupboards upper deck.  I was going to hand them out as noshes on the dining table when it was lost but now found!  It was originally bought when ODD JOB had the items on sale.  Any bids will be delightfully welcome. Some caution comes to mind.  Take note that these items were left in my apartment since Sept 11.  It has seen the light yet again when I moved back to Queens.  I did partake on some of the cheese which is still shrink wrapped and protected with aluminum foil.  Aw heck who wants this stuff anyway?  I take it back.. BIDS Over!!!  Stop... no more bid please!  Maybe some neighborhood cats will want it.. Ill just leave it out to 'pastuer' in the nearby Park.  There has to bee some hungry pigeons out there.  (_)_) ~Net
