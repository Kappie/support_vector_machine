I can take the TXML AND do the bio project.  yeeeeeeees.  this is good.  this is very good.  but this also means that I have to take the test in like... record time.  I told him to wait for me until 4.35.... and.... so that gives me like 15 minutes for the test.  oh my god I am going to bomb it, but at least I've taken it.  alright.  I can breathe now.  I can stop freaking out and cursing gabriel in my head now.  okay.  okay.  okay.  and now I can go finish my humanities homework in peace.  yes yes yes yes yes yes yes.  ++sunny
