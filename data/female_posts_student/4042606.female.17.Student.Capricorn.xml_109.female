So by Wednesday I will be in New Hampshire, also because I am leaving early; Abby will no longer have a reason to be here and she will go back to Pennsylvania. So it's a lose-lose situation for Ian. All because he kept ditching me for a stupid rich college bitch and a retarded red headed idiot. If he ever wants to apologize to me, he knows to leave my sister alone, an he shouldn't hang out with those two Burlington sluts anymore. Then maybe I will talk to him again. What pisses me off even more is that Michelle girl is actually encouraging Abby to hang out with Ian. I never liked Michelle and now she just game me more of a reason to hate her guts. If she thinks she still has a say in what happens in Vermont, while she is sitting comfortably in Ohio, well, she has another thing coming. So anyway, I probably will never be posting on this crappy website again, unless I want to check up on what that idiot Ian is doing.
