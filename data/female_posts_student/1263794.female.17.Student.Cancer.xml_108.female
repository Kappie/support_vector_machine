(Which will inevitably happen) I like this one, maybe I will update more now.  In other news, AP's are OVER. I don't even care that I don't think I did well. Actually I do, I'm just trying to make myself not care because I can't do anything about it. Common sense definitely did not guide me through APES as I thought it would. Sigh. (I really did just sigh)  This weekend should be fun. Busch Gardens never lets one down. Neither do nieces. Yayayayyyy.  Survivor finale ROCKED. Actually is was kind of predictable, but it was really sweet none the less. I think I'm gonna vote for Lex. Too bad only like three of you know what I'm talking about. I would write about it, but I know most people don't care...which blows me away still.  My sun burn still hurts. But I don't think it will give me cancer, it's beginning to fade. Thanks for the concern though Melissa.   School is done in less than a month. Then we will be seniors, then we will be in COLLEGE. Duke I hope, I doubt, but I hope. Senior year will be nice. No more Ms.Schitz, no more APUSH, psychology, drama production, nice to have a few things to look forward to.   My brother just spit on my dog. My 26 year old brother. Now my dog is trying to lick it. That is gross.  Okay well, that's all I have to say now. Hope your happy Robin.
