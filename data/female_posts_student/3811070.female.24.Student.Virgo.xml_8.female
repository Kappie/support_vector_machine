I think You did a stellar fucking job, especially when You made Ireland, ice cream, babies, Johnny Depp, and SpongeBob.  But I think that You really crossed the fucking line when You thought to make Urinary Tract Infections. If You really are a woman like all the Wiccans and Hippies and Californians say you are, then no wonder You made Mary have Jesus for You because these Urinary Tract Infections really goddamn suck. (No offense.) I would be happy to trade You whatever You want for this infection that I have right now, because let me tell You, God, it's a damn inconvenience. I have some really nice comic books stored away, or I can make You a three-layer chocolate marble cake with cream cheese icing which I'm sure You have in Heaven, but probably low-carb or something to make it healthier. (Do they have Atkins in Heaven now that Dr. Atkins passed away? Just wondering.)  Anyway, get back to me. I appreciate it. And again, thank You for ... You know. Everything.  -Me  If only it were that easy, talking to God. I'm sure that Christians maintain that they have a Bat Phone directly to the Almighty herself  (Himself? Itself? Who knows.) and they talk to Him or Her all the time, but .... if they did then I'm sure quite a lot less old ladies would get gipped out of their money by the assholes on the Old Time Gospel Hour. Am I right? Can I get a Amen?   Amen   So anyway, I have a Urinary Tract Infection. I haven't been to the doctor yet, that's later today. (Friday. Jesus, it's Friday. Muuuuust sleeeeep...) But I know I have one because it feels like I'm pissing razor blades. It wouldn't be so bad if it were like, once or twice a day or whatever... but being pregnant makes me pee like 50 times more, and having this UTI doubles that.  So I'm in and out of the freaking bathroom like 100 times a day. And right when I sit back down on the couch or get back in bed I have to pee all over again.  And this makes me question the existence of God. (As if my Catholic upbringing didn't do that years ago, right?) Because how can a God who loves us so much make such a grade-A fucking miserable thing like a Urinary Tract Infection? I can just see God right now, up On High or whatever looking down on Creation going, "You know... it's just too... perfect. So here's some War, and some Famine on top of that, and uh... here's Barney the Dinosaur, that oughta make them miserable, and .... one more thing, what else? OH! I know! Urinary Tract Infections!! That should piss them off. Silly Humans. "  I have drank an entire bottle of Cran-Apple juice. I hate Cran-Apple juice. Know why? Cause it tastes like shit, but you know why else? Because it makes you PEE! And does nothing to alleviate the pain of pissing razor blades like good old fashioned drugs can.  Please Lord, let her give me some drugs tomorrow. Please let it not be too late in the pregnancy for drugs. Pretty please, and I'll throw in an Amen on top if that suits you.  Oh, the baby's moving. You know, that has to be the greatest thing in the world, right? Too bad Hubby's sound freaking asleep right now so he can't feel it and talk to the baby like he normally does. But, like every other rational adult, he's in bed asleep right now. I wish I could be in bed asleep right now.  But sadly, I have to pee again.  I might as well just take in a pillow and a blanket and go right to sleep on the john. It's not like I don't already have hemorrhoids- however the crap you spell them.  Funny story, the pregnancy book I have says "In order to avoid hemmorrhoids, don't spend a lot of time on the toilet."   Okay, have these people BEEN pregnant? Don't spend a lot of time on the toilet? What between peeing all the time and being constipated (you really needed to know that, didn't you? haha.) half my fucking  day  is spent on the toilet.  *sigh*  Well there I go again, and yawning to boot so I'll just end this by saying I'm still really pissed off at You, God, for giving us Urinary Tract Infections.  But thanks for everything else.   -Me
