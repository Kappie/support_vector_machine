I finish up training and work a little for Edward Jones. I love this life! I get variety, and I don't really feel like I'm working. And, if I need days off - just because - I can turn down offers for both without feeling guilty. My life is beautiful and stress free.  Of course, I still need prayer for some things. But I'm getting through them somewhat victoriously - or I will eventually. maybe. on the other hand (the realistic one), i'm planning on failing quite a lot and proving to be the very disappointing human I am for these things, so I don't know what to do about that.   i liked what Corey said Wed. night - it was so great. all about our relationship with God being a story. it made me reassess my past and present issues with God. i was going to tell the girls about it in the car, on our way home Sun. night, but then the "Lady in Red" song came on, we all squealed, and had to gaze romantically out my window into the night and dream about being that very lady.   but it's not very interesting - my thoughts - anyway. i'm just glad that i realized a few things. by the way - AMAZING restaurant that I'm instructing everyone to try. Bella Vista on Western and south 58th street. it's a tiny little ma and pop place run by this very Greek family. they yell in Greek on their cell phones and through the kitchen doors like a Good Greek family should. I love that accent so incredibly much. Why couldn't I have been born in Greece? I'm so jealous. But good good Italian food. They won't let you split an entree, and the portion size is enough for 5.2 LaChelle meals, but it's okay, because you can take it to your fridge and extend the joy with others. Cutest restaurant ever - I went there on V-day for lunch.    I want to see the Mel Gibson movie. Jaci suggested it and I'm supporting her, that we should go next Wed. when it opens.  sparkles. Happy Presidents' Day. I hope you wore a tee shirt with the head of your favorite president on it. I don't know who my fave prez is, actually. But that's exciting, because I had thought that I had thoroughly discovered all my favorites of things. I'll have to do a little research. I give myself until Thursday, and then my answer is due. I may assign myself an essay too.
